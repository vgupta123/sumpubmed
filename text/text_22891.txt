BACKGROUND
the major function of the mitochondria , as a semiautonomous organelle, in plant growth and development is to provide energy through oxidative phosphorylation  <cit> . in different to the small mt genome of animals , plants have longer mtdna ranging from 200kb to 2000kb  <cit> . to date, several mt genomes from fertile and sterile plant species have been sequenced, including arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , oryza sativa <cit> , beta vulgaris <cit> , zea mays <cit> , nicotiana tabacum <cit> , triticum aestivum <cit> , and five species from the brassica genus, i.e., b. napus , b. rapa , b. oleracea , b. juncea , and b. carinata   <cit> . the sequencing results indicated that apart from ribosomal protein genes, protein-coding genes are also relatively conserved both in nucleotide sequence and in number. however, the non-coding sequences are quite inconsistent among species, and even within the same species. the presence of large and short repeats is responsible for the dynamic multipartite structures, reorganization, and recombination  <cit> .

in higher plants, mitochondrial inheritance usually follows the maternal origin during sexual hybridization. however, much more complicated modes are detected in somatic hybridization, wherein mt genome inheritance is derived from either or both biparents  <cit> . in the latter pattern, part of the mt genome, including cytoplasmic male sterility  genes, can be transferred from the donor parent to the receptor parent, and the introgressed segment experiences extensive rearrangement and recombination with the mtdna of the receptor one. orf <dig>  originally identified in radish, was transferred successfully to various species, including arabidopsis, b. napus, and b. oleracea by somatic hybridization  <cit> .

cms genes have a defect in the production of functional pollen. generally, genes associated with cms genes are located in the periphery of certain known mitochondrial genes and are cotranscribed with them  <cit> . t-urf <dig>  was the first identified aberrant gene in the texas -cytoplasm of maize, which encodes a  <dig> kda membrane-spanning polypeptide that depolarizes the mitochondria and leads to cell death  <cit> . in the bt -type cms line of rice, orf <dig> was cotranscribed with the atp <dig> gene forming a  <dig>  kb transcript  <cit> . the expressed protein contains a predicted transmembrane domain  <cit> .

in the brassica genus, the complete mt genomes of five species are sequenced, coupled with the basic feature of published cms genes, which allows the detection of the extraneous source from donor parent  of somatic hybrids.

RESULTS
genome size and nucleotide sequence in the genic region
the oguc mt genome was assembled into a  <dig>  bp master circle with  <dig> % g+c content . it encodes  <dig> proteins, three ribosomal rna sequences , and  <dig> trna sequences, which account for  <dig> % of the genome in total. of these  <dig> protein-coding genes, two were identical copies of atp <dig> and the cox2- <dig> gene were absent. taken mtdna from nap cms as control, two genes were detected to change the coding length. one of them is tatc, whose several continuous mutations were observed in the 3′-end and the stop codon was extended 27bp away . similar to the change in tatc, an additional  <dig> bp  was placed in the 5′-end of atp <dig>  whose nucleotide was completely identical to the one from radish . most of the other protein-coding genes were conserved in length, but the point mutation occurred extensively, where  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified scattered among the  <dig> genes when compared to nap. of the  <dig> snps,  <dig> were synonymous and  <dig> were non-synonymous . most of the variations were transitions. compared with their counterparts in raphanus sativus, cox <dig>  rps <dig>  and atp <dig> were also the same in terms of amino acid and nucleotide sequence except for atp <dig>  ccmc had  <dig> nucleotide substitutions, where  <dig> were non-synonymous. using r. sativus as the control, only two snps were detected: one differs by a synonymous mutation in position  <dig>  similar to the alignment of nap; the other was a g to a mutation in position  <dig>  which caused a thr to gly switch. among the  <dig> protein-coding genes in pol,  <dig> have an identical copy in nap and only  <dig> genes showed locus polymorphism  <cit> . consequently, many variations in oguc may be associated with its background of somatic hybridization and complicated evolution.

reconstruction of the nap-cms cybrid mitochondrial genome
the syntenic regions of oguc and nap were analyzed using a bl2seq algorithm. a total of  <dig> segments ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp possessed at least 95% similarity and at least  <dig> kb in size, which were responsible for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of these two mitotype genomes, respectively. the majority of the syntenic regions contained 99% similarity except s <dig> , s <dig> , s <dig> , s <dig> , and s <dig> . the direction of  <dig> regions was identical, but that of the other  <dig> was the opposite . estimating the minimum recombination events that occurred to account for the restructuring of the two mitotypes was difficult because of the many syntenic regions.

reorganization of the mitochondrial genome
the large and short repeats were analyzed. the circle molecule had a pair of large repeat sequences  and only a trny gene was included. it is about four times the length of equivalent from nap , but no sequence similarity was found between them . one of the two direct repeats in oguc occupied the non-syntenic region between s <dig> and s <dig> and another one extended from the end of s <dig> to the start of s <dig> . the presence of large repeats is believed to be associated with the formation of multipartite structure  <cit> , which are isomeric forms that consist of the master circle and two smaller subgenomic circles  via intramolecular homologous recombination in oguc . the coexistence phenomenon of various molecular forms was extensively predicted in many species sequenced that were verified through direct observation using electron microscopy in tobacco  <cit> .

apart from the large repeats, the mt genome of higher plants also distributes massive short repeats  <cit> . we identified  <dig> repeats , including both direct and inverted repeats, that were responsible for  <dig> % of the genome. the short repeats contributed to genome reorganization and arrangements, although the frequency of these events was not as high  <cit> . we assayed reorganization relationship of some syntenic regions and found that two short repeats were closely related to the rearrangement of five syntenic domains, as elaborated on figure  <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> were originally located adjacent to each other in nap. s <dig> was on the opposite direction and only  <dig> bp was present between s <dig> and s <dig>  however, because of the reorganization caused by the repeating r <dig> , s <dig> and s <dig> transposed with each other that made the gap between them disappeared. on the other hand, s <dig> was separated to thousands of base pairs away and shifted the orientation. another was the combined fragments of s <dig> and s <dig>  which was divided by increasing the copies of r <dig>  in oguc. similar rearrangement relationship was also discovered in other mtdna  <cit> .

unique region of the genome
we investigated the cms-specific mitochondrial regions by comparing it with the other six entire mitochondrial genome sequences of brassica species . up to  <dig> unique regions, which constitute  <dig> % of the genome, were assayed . u <dig> and u <dig> had two identical copies that were included in the large repeats. u <dig> almost fully occupied the gap between s <dig> and s <dig>  similar to u <dig>  which possessed the non-syntenic region between s <dig> and s <dig>  u <dig>  which included orf <dig>  must have come from the radish mtdna. the speculation was proved again by the fact that this segment was almost 100% identical to the orf138-included region from r. sativus . atp <dig> was equal to that from radish, with first  <dig> bp contained in the end of u <dig>  a domain composed of u <dig> plus the next  <dig> bp of atp <dig> was also possibly from radish because a part of its sequence is found in radish . the other cms-specific regions were included in the partial region of the non-syntenic domains. analyzing those specific regions using blastn searches against the ncbi database, with sizes ranging from 2% in u <dig> to 100% in u <dig>  were aligned with the mtdna of arabidopsis thaliana. for the blast and non-blast region from specific region, we speculated that they were either the transfer of nuclear counterpart from one of the biparents or originated from the mtdna of radish, but the latter hypothesis was more reasonable. more empirical proofs are needed to demonstrate this.

homology with rapeseed chloroplast genome
exogenous segments of the intergenic spacer are derived from the chloroplast genome and these sequences migrate and integrate into the mt genome  <cit> . thus, we analyzed the homology between oguc mtdna and rapeseed  chloroplast genome. six homologous segments with more than 95% identity were found in this genome . the six segments ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp, and accounted for  <dig> % of the total mt genome. all of the sequences were located in the syntenic region.

orfs and predicted cms-related chimeric orf in this genome
we detected  <dig> orfs in this genome, with the shortest size equal to  <dig> bp, which summed to  <dig> % of the mitotype. of the  <dig> orfs,  <dig>  were shared in one or more brassica genomes, which were remotely related to cms. however, they are likely functional genes as these later-discovered genes ccm, orf <dig> , and orfb   <cit> . of the remaining  <dig> unique orfs in the oguc mitochondrial genome,  <dig> orfs were totally not matched and  <dig> were partly identical to those present in the other six mitotypes. five, including orf <dig>  which is the oguc-related cms gene, out of eight non-matched orfs were completely or partially situated in the unique regions . three common orfs and three unique orfs were located in the cp-derived domains . among them, orf <dig> and orf344- <dig> were highly similar to  <dig> segments of the beta subunit of rna polymerase, which were wholly situated in the chloroplast genome with a length of  <dig> amino acids. when the intact nucleotide sequence of beta subunit of rna polymerase was aligned with oguc mtdna, h <dig> was found to be a truncated rna polymerase beta subunit with 97% similarity. some point mutations and indels resulted in the production of these two orfs. similar to orf344- <dig>  a truncated ribulose- <dig>  5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit  gene from cp genome evolved into orf <dig>  based on the three features of cms related genes, namely, unique to the given mitotype, membrane-spanning domains and near to the functional genes  <cit> , orf <dig>  which encodes a  <dig> kda transmembrane protein that showed toxicity to bacterial growth, can be suppressed by the nuclear rfo locus  <cit> .

discussion
we obtained the complete mt genome of the oguc devoid of cox2- <dig> and increased copy of atp <dig>  cox2- <dig> and cox2- <dig> were distributed in the start region of s <dig> and the end region of s <dig> in nap mitotype , respectively. however, as the rearrangement and reconstruction of mt genome, s <dig> and s <dig> were translocated adjacent to each other in oguc. in addition, the first  <dig> bp and last  <dig> bp domains of s <dig>  in which the cox gene was included, were incorporated into one superposition. consequently, the cox2- <dig> gene was saved whereas the cox2- <dig> was lost. this phenomenon was also observed in car and ole mitotypes  <cit> . for the atp <dig>  one was located in the syntenic region, which is in itself, and the other one was in the non-syntenic region. compared to the ncbi data with a  <dig> bp segment, including the redundant atp <dig> with its perimeter zone, we found that this segment was almost 100% identical to the corresponding section in the  <dig> bp domain from the mitochondrial atp <dig> pseudogene of f0-f <dig> atpase proteolipid from r. sativus . the complete  <dig> bp segment from radish was likely broken into two parts; one with atp <dig> included was fused into the reconstructed mitochondria during the rearrangement and reorganization that resulted from the collision of the cytoplasm of two cells, and the other one was lost. additionally, tatc and atp <dig> were also reasonably speculated that they were fused from radish based on the additive length absent from the other  <dig> lines of brassica family while completely identical to the counterpart of radish . however, although cox <dig>  rps <dig>  atp <dig> and ccmc share completely or partly same nucleotide sequence between oguc and radish , we still can’t make sure whether they were invaded from radish or not only by the snps analysis.

when nap mtdna was taken as the control,  <dig> syntenic regions were detected in total. estimating the number of recombination events was difficult because of the many syntenic regions. however, relative to two more similar mitotypes  that have  <dig> syntenic region with the same analysis criterion   <cit> , it showed complex reconstruction. oguc mitotype must have undergone complicated changes and evolutionary events when the cytoplasm of two cells contacted each other.

the large repeat  in oguc was longer than others, except for r <dig>  which mediates the homologous recombination with another two repeats, r and r <dig> in ole. the  <dig> bp segment of r’ showed 99% similarity with r <dig> in car. interestingly, except for ole, the six mt mitotypes contained only one large repeat, four of which contained the same large repeat, r .

* part of the data cited from  <cit> .

using one genome of the seven mitotypes as the control to find the unique regions for every mitotype, the percentage ranged from 0% in three mitotypes  to  <dig> % in oguc. both nap and car contained three shorter specific segments constituting  <dig> % and  <dig> % of these two genomes, respectively. a  <dig> bp unique segment located in pol contributed  <dig> % to its total genome. in terms of the percentage, at least 7% of the exogenous sequences from radish mtdna coexist with the oguc mtdna . when searched against the ncbi databases using those specific segments, similar alignments to that of oguc were obtained, some of which resembled those in arabidopsis thaliana.

we also predicted the cp-derived sequence, which was intriguing because the seven mitotypes were blasted for the identical six segments with identities more than 95% . however, because of the large copy of r <dig>  five cp-derived segments had two copies in ole. from the cp-derived data, we found that brassica species have stable sources of chloroplast sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
this study finished mtdna sequencing of a ogura-cms-cybrid , which derived from somatic fusion between brassica napus and sterile radish. by contrast to one or more of six other brassica lines, we reasonably speculated that tatc gene and  <dig> unique regions, u <dig> and u <dig>  must be introgressed from radish. in addition, the rearrangement mediated by large and short repeats between these two parental mtdnas extensively existed. with regard to the evolution of this integrated cms mtdna, more data need to be known.
