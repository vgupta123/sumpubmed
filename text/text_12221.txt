BACKGROUND
immunoglobulins are the molecular mediators of the adaptive humoral immune response in jawed vertebrates. somatic recombination during b lymphoid differentiation is required for immunoglobulin expression  <cit> . in the germline state, the genes encoding for the variable , diversity  and joining  segments are dispersed across a wide genomic stretch. a process called vj joining brings together the specific genes for each segment type and thereby creates the second exon of a transcriptionally competent immunoglobulin gene. the recombination machinery consists of two recombination activating gene products rag <dig> and rag <dig> as well as various other proteins, reviewed in  <cit> . the cis-acting recognition signal sequences  target the recombination machinery to the correct genomic site. each rss consists of heptamer and nonamer motifs flanking a  <dig> or  <dig> bp long central spacer. in the rearranging locus, two variably separated double strand dna breaks are introduced next to one  <dig> bp and one  <dig> bp rss. the nascent non-homologous dna ends are joined into a coding joint in the middle of the recombined gene. the dna fragment between the breaks is either deleted or inverted depending on the relative orientation of the recombining genes.

the immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain rearrangements in many species are temporally separated during b cell development. in mouse and man but not in chicken, a population of cells can be demonstrated that has undergone rearrangement only in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus  <cit> . a surrogate light chain  is temporarily expressed at this stage of the b cell development  <cit> . slc is composed of two polypeptides vpreb and igll <dig> that are homologous to the variable and the constant domain of the immunoglobulin light chain, respectively  <cit> . in mice, three vpreb paralogues vpreb <dig>  vpreb <dig> and vpreb <dig> have been described  <cit> . the iglv-like vpreb <dig> is missing from the human genome. gene targeting studies demonstrate the role of slc genes in the production of b cells  <cit> .

the genome sequence of bos taurus permits for the first time a direct estimate of the size of the immunoglobulin light chain gene pool in domestic cattle, one of the most important farm animal species. we have characterized the structure and composition of bovine immunoglobulin and surrogate light chain gene loci as a part of a community effort to annotate the version  <dig>  assembly of bos taurus genome sequence  <cit> .

RESULTS
the bovine immunoglobulin lambda  chain locus is located on chromosome  <dig>  in version  <dig>  of the genome sequence ,  <dig> variable,  <dig> joining and  <dig> constant genes could be identified in  <dig> scaffolds.  <dig> λ variable genes  fulfilled the criteria for classification as potentially functional .

based on the phylogenetic analyses and nucleotide sequence identities in a gene region corresponding to fr1–fr <dig>  the λ variable genes can be grouped into  <dig> phylogenic subgroups . the λ variable gene subgroups in the present work accommodate all the characterized bovine iglv genes from  <cit>  and most of the ovine iglv genes  <cit> . interspecies comparison revealed that four of the six described ovine gene families or subgroups  <cit>  are represented in the bovine collection  and contain  <dig>  of the bovine genes. as can be seen from additional file  <dig>  subgroup  <dig> is the largest and contains  <dig>  of the potentially functional λ variable genes. this subgroup seems to be ruminant specific as no human or mouse genes co-segregate with its members. subgroups  <dig> and  <dig> are each represented in the genome by a single subgroup-specific gene cluster. the  <dig> bovine genes of subgroup  <dig> are all pseudogenes as are the ovine genes in this subgroup. with the exception of one gene, the bovine  genes in this subgroup share an in-frame stop codon in framework  <dig> .  <dig> genes  of which  <dig> are potentially functional do not co-segregate with any members of the established ovine λ variable gene subgroups. however, λ variable genes in the bovine subgroups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are similar to genes in human specific subgroups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively . no ovine, human or mouse genes closely related to iglv <dig> iglv <dig> or iglv <dig> could be identified. further, no bovine genes from the current assembly could be mapped to the established ovine families iii or iv  <cit> .

three immunoglobulin lambda joining and five immunoglobulin lambda constant genes were identified . two of the j-c gene pairs form apparently functional units. iglc <dig> and iglc <dig> have identical coding sequence but differ at 3'utr. chen et al.  <cit>  described four iglc genes which correspond to iglc2-iglc <dig> in this paper.

the bovine immunoglobulin κ locus is located in chromosome  <dig>  a blast search against btau_ <dig>  revealed matches only at a single location in scaffold chr <dig> . <dig>   <dig> variable,  <dig> joining and one constant immunoglobulin κ gene were identified.  <dig> variable genes  were classified as potentially functional . the variable κ genes can be grouped in  <dig> phylogenic subgroups preserving the established ovine specific gene families .  <dig>  of the bovine genes co-segregate with ovine κ variable gene families i, ii and iv  <cit> . subgroup  <dig> is the largest and contains  <dig>  of the potentially functional genes. all the seven members of subgroup  <dig> are pseudogenes.

surrogate light chain genes vpreb <dig>  igll <dig> and vpreb <dig> were identified in the assembly at or close to the λ chain locus. the vpreb <dig> and igll <dig> lie next to each other as in the mouse genome  <cit> . vpreb <dig> is located close to the immunoglobulin λ constant genes iglc1-iglc <dig> but in the opposite transcriptional orientation. none of the surrogate light chain genes is flanked by an rss. the exon-intron boundaries of the surrogate light chain genes are conserved between cow, mouse and man . the vpreb <dig> and vpreb <dig> gene structures resemble those of the immunoglobulin λ variable genes with a leader and main exon. successful cloning of the cdnas using primers that span the exon/intron boundaries and extend far into the 3'utr of the germline genes confirms that the mrna expression of surrogate light chain genes does not depend on recombination. the functionality of the surrogate light chain genes was additionally supported by demonstrating the expression of vpreb <dig>  vpreb <dig> and igll <dig> mrna in fetal liver, spleen, bone marrow, lymph node and thymus .

the cdna and genomic dna sequence analysis of the surrogate light chain genes revealed several single nucleotide differences in comparison with the reference genomic sequence . therefore, it seems that the bovine surrogate light chain genes are polymorphic.

discussion
in this paper, we have presented the analysis of the immunoglobulin and surrogate light chain gene assortment extracted from the bos taurus genome sequence btau_ <dig>   <cit> . btau_ <dig>  is nearly completely based on a whole genome shotgun sequence from a single animal  with a 30% inbreeding coefficient  <cit> . this facilitates the analysis of immunoglobulin genes, which is in mixed databases greatly complicated by gene polymorphism and targeted somatic mutations  <cit> . most of the functional light chain genes have probably been included in our gene set although the exact number of genes is likely to change in the future genome versions.  <dig> λ variable genes were in genomic contigs not assigned to a specific chromosomal location and might include orphons.

an interspecies comparison suggests ruminant specific adaptations:

 the bovine κ locus appears small and uncomplicated when compared with the λ locus . this might reflect the preferential use of the λ light chain in cattle  <cit> .

 in cattle, the number of functional immunoglobulin light chain genes is markedly lower than in mice and in man, i.e.  <dig> vs.  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . further, the variation in cdr <dig> length is more restricted and the number of unique cdr1–cdr <dig> combinations is lower than in mice and man . even though some genes might be missing from btau_ <dig> , the number of potentially functional bovine light chain genes probably overestimates the bona fide functional genes for which protein evidence is required. we are not aware of any other approximations on the number of functional immunoglobulin genes in ruminants. by extrapolation, the total number of λ variable gene segments in the sheep genome has been estimated from 60– <dig>  <cit>  to  <dig>  <cit> . the latter estimate is, however, based on cdna data.

the data on human and murine immunoglobulins are from imgt database  <cit> .

 the phylogenetic analysis suggests that most of the potentially functional λ genes belong to a single subgroup  that is not apparent in the human or in the mouse genomes but is present in sheep genome. this subgroup comprises  <dig> variable genes of which  <dig> are potentially functional. the cdr <dig>  <cit>  is either  <dig> or  <dig> amino acids long with a characteristic hydrophobic residue at position  <dig>  based on similarities on primary sequences, the cdr  <dig> structures among the members of subgroup  <dig> correspond most closely to the canonical loop  <dig> structures  <dig> and  <dig> found on λ chain variable regions  <cit> . cdr <dig> is  <dig> amino acids long and probably adopts a hair pin structure commonly found on cdr <dig> of λ and κ light chains  <cit> . it remains to be seen whether or not the cdrs adopt any of the established canonical immunoglobulin structures in reality. no high resolution structures are currently available for bovine immunoglobulins in the pdb archives  <cit> .

 the apparent expansion of the pseudogene subgroup  <dig> is intriguing although the reasons behind this are currently elusive.  <dig> subgroup members out of  <dig> share an identical stop codon in framework  <dig> 

the data on the overall organization of the bovine λ chain locus is still quite fragmentary . it could resemble the human locus, which displays a  <dig> kb long upstream region of  <dig> to  <dig> variable genes followed by  <dig> to  <dig> pairs of joining and constant genes all in one transcriptional orientation  <cit> . however, recombination using inversion cannot be ruled out in the bovine λ chain locus at present. in contrast to what is found in man and cattle, the murine λ chain locus is much reduced in size  and contains two small clusters of different immunoglobulin lambda chain genes .

the κ chain locus is much less complicated in cattle than in man or mouse. all identified κ genes were localized to a ca.  <dig> kb genomic segment within chr <dig> . <dig> . in comparison, the κ locus spans ca.  <dig>  mb in man  <cit>  and ca.  <dig>  mb in mouse  <cit> . the relative orientation of the bovine genes allows recombination exclusively by deletion. in mice, the relative orientation of more than  <dig> of the  <dig> murine κ variable genes supports inversion  <cit> . in man, a large duplication has produced nearly identical copies of  <dig> variable κ genes ca.  <dig> kb upstream in an opposite orientation. in addition,  <dig> variable genes most proximal to the j-c gene region support inversion  <cit> . a kappa deleting element  homologous to the murine recombining sequence  is located about  <dig> kb downstream of the human κ locus  <cit> . a permanent disruption of one or both κ loci by a recombination involving kde  is a frequent finding in human and murine b cells that produce the λ light chain  <cit> . interestingly, a highly similar sequence to kde is located  <dig>  kb downstream of the bovine κ locus .

the heavy chain locus could not be annotated as most of it is missing from btau_ <dig> . the available data on the light chain loci suggests that a moderate number of potentially functional light chain genes exist in the bovine genome. although the heavy chains add more to the recombinatorial diversity of immunoglobulins than the light chains, post-recombinatorial mechanisms might also contribute to a fully blown bovine preimmune repertoire. the relative importance of vj recombination for the generation of the preimmune repertoire in ruminants is currently controversial  <cit> . in late fetal and neonatal sheep, however, the repertoire is expanded by somatic hypermutation in the ileal peyer's patch  <cit> .

surrogate light chain  is needed to expand the h+l- cell population in species in which heavy and light chain genes are sequentially arranged. this assures that sufficient number of cells productively rearrange both loci  <cit> . the expression of slc genes in the bovine fetal tissues  confirms their functionality. the data presented in this paper does not permit further conclusions on the role of slc genes in cattle. nevertheless, analyses of serial sections by immunohistochemistry have revealed specific sites in the bovine fetus where there are no light chain positive cells but which still contain heavy chain positive cells .

CONCLUSIONS
this study describes the bovine assortment of immunoglobulin and surrogate light chain genes based on btau_ <dig> . a large fraction of the potentially functional variable genes belong to subgroups that are shared between cattle and sheep but not found in man or in mouse. the number of functional light chain variable genes in btau_ <dig>  is moderate in comparison with the corresponding number in the human or mouse genomes. the new data on the immunoglobulin light chain genes provides novel insight on the humoral immune system of ruminants and should facilitate the development of vaccines and other therapeutic tools against cattle specific infectious diseases.
