BACKGROUND
the purpose of genetic association studies is to discover genetic loci that contribute to an inherited trait, identify the variants behind these associations and ascertain their functional role in determining the phenotype  <cit> . modern association studies bring to bear on this problem high coverage genotype data, comprehensive databases of genetic variation that allow imputation of most common ungenotyped variants to high accuracy and extensive, publicly available, in silico resources housing a growing assortment of genomic data that allow functional characterization of vast regions of the human genome. in the typical genome–wide association study , the first two forms of data are combined to reconstruct genotypes to a desired density and these genotypes are then systematically tested for association with the phenotype. the functional annotation data are most frequently used in post hoc interpretation of evident associations raised by the analysis  <cit> .

to date, functional annotation data have rarely played more than an indirect role in assessing evidence for association. for example, they may be used to suggest candidate genes and snps for study or to support links between candidate snps and genes. while methods to incorporate functional annotation data a priori in genetic association analyses exist, they are infrequently used. the prevailing approach to this is via a two–staged hierarchical model in which coefficients in the stage i generalized linear model for phenotype given genotype and exposure measurements are regressed, in stage ii, on the annotation data . this is limited to analysis of a modest number of variants and does not make use of prior data derived from previous association studies to inform the nature of that relationship.

it is becoming increasingly clear that a widening array of annotation data correlates with a variant’s having been associated with a human phenotype . in what follows, we describe a formal approach to inference for association that combines functional annotation data  with genotype data . we construct the prior distribution through careful analysis of snps housed in the gwas catalog  <cit> . we refer to the linear combination of the annotation variables defined by this model and evaluated for a given snp as its ‘functional annotation signature’. we show that functional signatures so derived are predictive of the association status of snps not used in their creation and that, when coupled with genetic association data following the method we describe, improve the efficiency of association testing in a gwas study of ovarian cancer. data used to construct and evaluate the functional signatures are available at ftp://stat.duke.edu/pub/users/iversen/functionalsignatures/.

RESULTS
in association studies statistical analysis is utilized to measure the evidence in favor of association. the data that inform these analyses usually comprise phenotype labels, snp genotype data and a set of non–genetic covariates in addition to functional annotations of the variants under study. the statistical analysis may take many forms, varying according to choice of modeling approach and inferential paradigm . the approach we develop here relies on bayesian inference but can also be applied when the genetic association summaries are derived from a frequentist analysis. in this paradigm, prior data on a quantity of interest  are updated to reflect evidence in the current data set.

a bayesian analysis of genetic association data returns an estimate of the posterior odds of association of each marker given the available data. when the data take two distinct forms — here subject–level phenotype, genotype and covariate data and variant–level functional annotations — the posterior odds of association may be calculated in two stages, either by incorporating functional data prior to or following evaluation of the genetic data. the latter represents the heuristic typically followed in practice, whereby functional data is evaluated in an informal way  conditional on evidence for association. here we describe a model–based framework for combining functional and association data following the second factorization. we focus on the case–control study design for purposes of illustrating integration of the a priori  models for functional annotation data we describe below into analyses of genetic association data. details of the models and their assumptions are provided in methods.

when the functional data are incorporated as prior information, the posterior odds of a snp’s association given the functional and subject–level data can be written as the product of the bayes factor  in favor of association and the prior odds of association given the functional data. the bf is the ratio of the integrated likelihood of the phenotype data given the covariate and genotype data assuming the snp is associated to the integrated likelihood of the phenotype data given the covariate data only . it is a commonly used bayesian statistical measure of association and is calculated by the snptest  <cit>  and bimbam  <cit>  packages for analysis of gwas data. alternately, it can be approximated by the abf  <cit> , allowing the method to be used in conjunction with standard frequentist association testing software.

in short, the functional annotation data are incorporated into an analysis by formally updating the prior odds of association given the annotation data by a standard measure of genetic association. this process is depicted schematically in figure  <dig>  in what follows, we describe the model used to calculate prior odds of association and demonstrate its use in a gwas of ovarian cancer. in it, the log of a snp’s prior odds of association equals α + fβ, where f denotes its functional data and α and β are parameters. we refer to the linear combination fβ associated with a snp as its ‘functional signature’.figure  <dig> 
two–staged procedure for integrating variant–level functional annotation data with subject–level genetic association data. at the first stage, functional annotation data are combined to estimate the prior  probability of association for each variant. at stage two, these estimates are combined with the bayes factor  in favor of genetic association via bayes’ formula to estimate the posterior  probability of association for each variant.



functional signatures of known associations
we constructed the functional annotation signatures by estimating the multivariate relationship between a set of functional annotation variables and the binary association status of a set of snps. in this way, we identify a linear combination, βf, of the functional annotations, denoted f. we refer to this linear combination as a snp’s ‘functional signature’ when it is evaluated using that snp’s annotations, fs. figure  <dig> provides a schematic of our approach. in brief, we identified a set of associated snps and, for each, we chose a matching, unassociated ‘control’ snp. we divided the matched pairs into ‘training’ and ‘validation’ sets and used the former to construct a series of models to predict association status given the function data and used the latter to compare the performance of these models. we chose the model that demonstrated the best predictive accuracy in the validation data, as measured by concordance index, to define the functional annotation signatures.figure  <dig> 
construction and evaluation of models for  probability of association given the functional annotation data. the purple arrows represent model construction , while the green arrows represent evaluation of the models. construction of the training set, validation set and functional annotation database are depicted in additional file 1: figure s <dig> and described in methods. the training data were used to construct a series of models, each distinguished by the coefficients  it assigns to the various annotation variables. we chose the best among these by comparing their predictions in the validation set using the concordance index.



we began by constructing a matched case–control study of snps in which the cases were drawn from the gwas catalog  <cit>  and the controls were identified from the hapmap database, release  <dig>  phases ii and iii merged genotypes. we identified  <dig>  case snps and, for each, identified one control snp matched on chromosome, minor allele frequency and the genotyping platform it appeared on. since snps in the gwas catalog are arguably more frequently tags than the directly associated variant, we identified ‘ld partners’  <cit>  for each case and control snp. we grouped each case and control snp together with its ld partners to form blocks.

using on–line bioinformatics resources, we assembled a set of functional annotation variables representing a variety of contextual descriptions and empirical measurements with which we annotated each of the  <dig>  case, control and ld partner snps. we included annotation variables shown to be correlated with presence in the gwas catalog or that we believed likely to be so. these were: dbsnp function designation; summaries of encode project  <cit>  data on transcription levels assayed by rna–seq  <cit> , measures of signal enrichment for h3k4me <dig>  h3k27ac and h3k4me <dig> histone modifications associated with enhancer and promoter activity  <cit> , evidence for overlap with a dnasei hypersensitivity cluster  <cit>  and evidence for transcription factor binding ; phylop evolutionary conservation scores  <cit> ; indicators for whether or not the variant falls in a region of known copy number variation, a region containing insertions or deletions or a region with inversions  <cit> ; polyphen– <dig>  <cit>  probability that a mutation is damaging; and regulomedb score  <cit> . we used principal components analysis to reduce  <dig> broad chip–seq,  <dig> caltech rna–seq, and  <dig> phylop encode track summary statistics to the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> principal components, respectively, that explained at least 90% of variation in the class.

while not a comprehensive set, the functional variables we chose to work with covered the major annotation classes available at the time of analysis and are readily available to individuals executing an association study. the infrastructure and methods described here are easily updated to accommodate new variables as they become generally available. table  <dig> lists the  <dig> variables that we used to construct the functional signatures of association.table  <dig>

the  <dig>  snps included in the analysis were grouped into  <dig>  case and an equal number of control blocks. we randomly selected  <dig>  of these matched case–control pairs for development of the model  and left the remaining  <dig> pairs for model evaluation and comparison . we modeled the probability that a snp is associated given its functional data using a logistic regression model in which the association status of the individual snps in the case blocks is assumed unknown. the model assumes, however, that each case block contains at least one truly associated snp and that each control block contains none; as in  <cit> , the identities of the associated snps are not specified as they are unknown ; a prior distribution on the overall fraction of associated snps was employed to encourage their number to be close to one on average. in this way, the model is free to identify multivariate patterns in the annotation data  of individual snps that would be diluted by averaging the annotation measurements of all snps within a block.

while the assembled list of functional predictors includes measures that have been demonstrated to correlate with the association status of snps in the gc, it also includes a number of measures whose utility in this regard was unclear. hence, we expected that only a fraction of the  <dig> variables would contribute to predicting phenotype association. we used shrinkage priors  <cit>  to reflect this belief and chose the normal–exponential–gamma  distribution for its ability to penalize heavily weakly determined predictors and to penalize weakly those that are well determined . further details of the model and the markov chain monte carlo  algorithm used for inference can be found in methods.

table  <dig> provides a summary of the coefficient estimates obtained for the binary regression of association status on the  <dig> functional annotation variables. because all variables in the model were standardized, coefficients measure the difference in the log–odds of phenotype association attributed to an increase of one standard deviation in the covariate when the others remain fixed. the majority of variation  in the functional scores as measured in the control block snps from the validation set, is due to the broad promoter/enhancer chip–seq principal components  and nearly all  of this variation is due to pcs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  each pc is a linear combination of the  <dig> summary statistics of the  <dig> assays. additional file 1: figure s <dig> depicts the loadings  for these pcs as they depend on histone modification, cell line and summary statistic. grossly, pc  <dig> measures total signal strength across all cell lines and histone modifications, pc  <dig> contrasts average signal strength of the h3k4me <dig> assay against average signal strength of the remaining assays, while the remaining pcs each contrast signal in one subset of cell lines with that in another . additional file 1: figure s <dig> and s <dig> depict the correlation matrix and a hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> summary statistics, respectively. for a given combination of cell line and histone modification, the signal strength ’) and peak signal ’) measures tend to be highly correlated with one another but tend to have only modest correlation with the signal consistency measure ’); patterns of correlation across cell lines and histone modifications are more complex.table  <dig>

estimates of the posterior mean and standard deviation are provided for each coefficient in the model along with the ratio of these quantities, a ‘signal–to–noise’ measure analogous to the z statistic.



the sequence conservation pcs collectively make the next largest contribution, explaining 16% of variation in the functional scores; pcs  <dig> and  <dig> explain >97% of this. each pc is a linear combination of the summary statistics of the  <dig> and  <dig> species phylop scores, each for all species and restricted to placental mammals. additional file 1: figure s <dig> graphs the loadings for these pcs as they depend on number of species, depth of alignment and summary statistic; additional file 1: figure s <dig> and s <dig> depict the correlation matrix and a hierarchical clustering of these variables, respectively. briefly, pc  <dig> measures total signal strength across scores with the scores based on the 28–way alignment weighted more heavily than those based on the 44–way alignment, while pc  <dig> contrasts the 28–way with 44-way scores.

the caltech rna–seq pcs collectively explain 10% of the signature, with pcs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contributing 87% of this. additional file 1: figure s <dig> depicts the loadings for these pcs as they depend on cell line and summary statistic. pc  <dig> provides a measure of total signal strength across all cell lines, while the remaining pcs each contrast signal in one subset of cell lines with that in another . additional file 1: figure s <dig> and s <dig> depict the correlation matrix and a hierarchical clustering of the rna–seq summary statistics, respectively. these reveal the largely complementary information provided by each of the cell lines as well as high correlations between the signal strength, peak signal and signal indicator measures of a given cell line. here, as in the broad chip–seq data, the signal consistency measure is only modestly correlated with the remaining signal measures.

regulomedb categorizes variants into a seven-level functional score based on a synthesis of regulatory data derived from encode and other sources. category  <dig> variants lack evidence of association; categories 4- <dig> show ‘minimal binding evidence’; categories  <dig> and  <dig> are ‘likely’ and ‘less likely to affect binding’, respectively; and category  <dig> variants are those ‘likely to affect binding and linked to expression of a gene target’. its score explains the next largest fraction  of variation. it is represented by six variables, each indicating a functional category; category  <dig> serves as the reference . categories  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> explain 99% of this variation suggesting that other annotation variables in the model better characterize the probability of phenotype association for variants in categories  <dig> and  <dig>  this is especially notable for category  <dig> as it is the only variable included in the model explicitly tied to eqtl status. this failure of simple eqtl summaries to provide predictive power once the other annotations are included in the model is consistent with our findings from a preliminary analysis that included lymphoblastoid line–based eqtl summaries derived from the scan database , but not the regulomedb variables. we found no practical or statistically detectable difference between the accuracy, as measured by concordance index , of out–of–sample predictions made using the model including all annotations and the model including all annotations except the eqtl variables.

virtually all  of the  <dig> % contribution to variation made by the dgv variables is due to the copy number and inversion variables. finally, at  <dig> %, the dbsnp functional class variables are the only remaining that contribute more than 1% of the variation in functional scores. virtually all  of this contribution is due to the non–synonymous designation and the polyphen– <dig> probability contributes to the model’s ability to predict within this class of variants. this suggests that more direct measures of a variant’s involvement in transcriptional regulation, such as location in or near a dnase i hypersensitive site , are better predictors of association than proximity to a nearby transcription start site  or other gene–centric landmark. indeed, it has been shown  <cit>  that gwas variants are concentrated in dhss, features captured by the broad promoter/enhancer chip–seq principal components and the transcription factor chip–seq data. these are more flexible measures that allow the model to distinguish between promoters and more distant enhancers, inactive versus active promoters and local versus more distant enhancer–tss interactions, each representing an important distinction  <cit>  relevant to predicting function.

we estimated the concordance indexes  for each model using the  <dig> matched case–control block pairs in the validation set as a tool for comparing the accuracy of their out–of–sample predictions. table  <dig> provides the estimates of concordance and associated 95% interval estimates. while the concordance statistics are not discernibly different from one another, the best out–of–sample predictive ability is achieved using the model with the prior distribution having the strongest shrinkage properties, i.e. the ‘neg3’ model.table  <dig>

application to an ovarian cancer multi–gwas study
we compared the ranks assigned to a group of variants in a gwas analysis when those ranks are calculated with and without the functional annotation data. each in the group of variants is assumed to have known association status  with epithelial ovarian cancer, where this determination is based on confirmatory studies subsequent to the gwas. the group is constructed as follows. there are currently  <dig> published, genome–wide significant loci for epithelial ovarian cancer. nine of the  <dig> have come to light through analysis of genome–wide snp data. these are rs <dig>  <cit> , rs <dig>  <cit> , rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  <cit> , rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  <cit> . the remaining two  were identified by candidate gene/pathway investigations  <cit> ; all  <dig> have been evaluated in very large confirmatory studies. we consider these to be ‘true positive’ variants. our analysis of data from the large–scale follow–up study of gwas candidates  <cit>  allowed us to identify a group of  <dig>  variants with ‘strong evidence’  in favor of the null model, i.e. the model of no association, based on jeffreys’ scale of evidence  <cit>  that we treat here as ‘true negatives’.

table  <dig> summarizes the gwas results for the true positive and true negative snps when the analysis is conducted with  and without  the functional signatures. note that, among the true positives, the snps discovered through candidate studies are ranked substantially lower than those identified via gwas. indeed, the evidence in the association data for these variants is actually against association . the gwas snps are all ranked in the top  <dig>   by the same measure and all have bayes factors of at least  <dig> to  <dig> in favor of association.table  <dig> 
functional signatures improve inference for association status in a gwas of ovarian cancer


ranks of known associated variants  tend to improve  when association and functional data are incorporated in the analysis  relative to when only the association data are used  and, hence, are more likely to be studied further. conversely, ranks of  unassociated variants  tend to fall with inclusion of the functional data. the functional data for a given variant is summarized by its ‘functional signature’, defined as the prior log–odds of its association given the functional data . aggregate  values are provided for the true + set and the true − set. ranks are out of approximately  <dig> m variants.



only two of the truly associated snps  are ranked higher when the functional data are ignored than when they are used, however their respective changes in rank are small. the median  rank of the truly associated snps was  <dig>   without and  <dig>   with the functional data included. if design constraints allowed only for followup of the top  <dig>  variants, a larger fraction  would be discovered with addition of the functional data than without ; with followup of  <dig>  variants, these fractions become 8/ <dig> and 7/ <dig>  in contrast, when the function data were included, the median  rank among a set of ‘true negative’ snps increased from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , while the number selected for followup fell from  <dig> to  <dig> under the 5k scenario and from  <dig> to  <dig> under the 10k scenario.

functional signatures of tag snps correlate with function of tagged snps
while a few of the functional variables, such as the function class designation ‘nonsynonymous’, incorporated in the signature are base pair specific, most map to contiguous regions of 100’s or 1000’s of base pairs. hence, the functional signatures associated with nearby snps are correlated. figure  <dig> is a plot of the correlation between the functional signatures of adjacent snps that passed qc in the ovarian cancer gwas described above as a function of the distance, measured in base pairs , between the two variants. this correlation is greater than  <dig>   for more than 80%  of adjacent variants, corresponding to those at distances of  <dig>  bps or less. hence, while there are gains to be realized in doing so, it is not necessary to impute to and annotate at the highest possible density to realize an increase in power to detect association through the use of functional signatures, a fact we demonstrated empirically above. note that typical bp distances between tagged  variants and their nearest tag will be on the order of one half of the distances reported here for adjacent tags.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
using the gwas catalog as a sampling frame, we developed a model for the probability that a given polymorphism is associated with an observable human phenotype given a set of functional annotation variables and demonstrated that this model has the ability to predict a set of phenotype associated variants not used in the model building exercise. we demonstrate several methods for incorporating functional annotation signatures defined by this model and evaluated for a snp’s annotation data as prior data and show through example that by doing so we improve the efficiency of gwas scale analysis to identify true positive associations for follow–up study.

the approach we describe is computationally tractable and scalable to modern genome–wide analysis. our use of penalized regression techniques to model the functional data and construct the function signatures allows us to consider a relatively large number of individual annotation variables while controlling for over–fitting. we evaluated sensitivity of the model’s out–of–sample predictions to choice of shrinkage prior and found that the most aggressive choice we examined, the model whose results are summarized herein, resulted in the best out–of–sample concordance estimates. our approach can be expanded and adapted to incorporate more detailed annotation data such as was recently released by the encode consortium  <cit>  or generated experimentally in individual labs.

in principle, estimates of the parameters in the model for snp association status given the functional data can be refined via bayesian updating as part of an association analysis. this requires an additional layer of analysis that is feasible, but computationally demanding to implement on a genome–wide scale. however, the value of this will be limited in settings where there are few truly associated snps and/or the case–control data supporting associations are weak, i.e. the vast majority of applications. here, bayesian updating will yield estimates equivalent to those using the approach we describe above up to monte carlo simulation error. indeed, we formally compared the two approaches using the ovarian cancer gwas data and found little change in the median ranks of the true positive  and true negative snps . this suggests that the added value of bayesian updating to the functional signatures will typically be limited.

performance for our integrative approach likely depends on the depth, specificity and density of coverage of the available annotation data. the current study defines a starting point and benchmark in each of these dimensions. in particular, while the depth of annotation considered here is sufficient to noticeably improve inference for association, it is clear from recent encode project consortium publications that it reflects only a small fraction of the complexity present in the regulatory landscape. further, none of the annotation variables are tailored to the outcome phenotype; indeed, the encode super–track data enter the model through linear combinations of the cell–line specific measurements, effectively averaging over cell type. in addition, the associations we observe in our study of the gwas catalog snps are those that tend to identify regulatory functions important to a range of phenotypes . this may explain, at least in part, the relatively modest nature of the improvements observed in our gwas analysis and the failure of general summaries of eqtl status to contribute meaningfully to the functional signatures. indeed, many regulatory processes are cell–type–specific  <cit>  and hence will be more informative for a given phenotype if measured in the appropriate context  <cit> . however, determining the relevant annotation data, assuming it exists, for a given phenotype requires domain expertise and more careful modeling to create functional signatures. while bayesian updating did not improve inferences in the ovarian cancer gwas example using the existing model, it may when the model is generalized to incorporate disease–specific annotations.

finally, our analyses have been carried out entirely at the hapmap iii density. our approach succeeds at this density because the functional signatures of snps nearby, at distances typical of hapmap iii, are highly correlated and hence the functional signatures of hapmap iii polymorphisms essentially tag function of nearby polymorphisms not in the database. as coverage  of the typical association study becomes more complete, the need to rely on correlations between functional signatures will diminish and their power to assist in identifying and localizing associations is expected to increase. association analyses at the density of the  <dig> genomes project database  <cit>  are now possible and will likely become common. the specificity of the functional signatures should improve when reconstructed and applied at this density as we plan to do as we continue to develop this approach.
