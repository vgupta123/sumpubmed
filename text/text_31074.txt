BACKGROUND
in general, fast neurotransmission is mediated by small molecule neurotransmitters acting on ionotropic receptors at the post-synaptic membrane, while neuropeptides bind g-protein-coupled receptors  and mediate slow neuromodulatory transmission. so far, there are only two exceptions to this general pattern: the phe-met-arg-phe-amide  activated na+ channel  in snails  <cit>  and the rf-amide activated hydra na+ channel   <cit> . both are ionotropic receptors, but their ligands are neuropeptides belonging to a family of fmrfamide-like peptides  conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates  <cit> . furthermore, fanac mediates fast responses of snail neurons to phe-met-arg-phe-amide  , a common neuropeptide in many nervous systems  <cit> .

fanac and hynac both belong to the degenerin/epithelial na+ channel  gene family  <cit>  but are not species orthologs. they rather belong to different branches of the deg/enac family  <cit> . deg/enacs are cation channels that are blocked by the diuretic amiloride and share sequence homology and a secondary structure characterized by two transmembrane spanning domains  and a large extracellular domain . they have various functions. degenerins from caenorhabditis elegans are mechanosensitive channels that mediate touch transduction  <cit> . in contrast, enac is a constitutively open channel that mediates na+ reabsorption in the mammalian kidney  <cit> . other family members from mammals are the acid-sensing ion channels , ionotropic receptors for protons  <cit> , and the bile-acid sensitive ion channel basic  <cit> . asics and basic are closely related to hynacs  <cit>  and, interestingly, asics are modulated by direct binding of flps  <cit> . pickpocket genes  encode deg/enacs in drosophila and mediate diverse functions such as salt and water taste  <cit> , mechanical nociception  <cit>  and pheromone-sensing  <cit> .

so far, four hynac subunits have been characterized: hynac <dig> to hynac <dig>  <cit> ; hynac <dig> probably is a pseudogene because it lacks an initiator methionine  <cit> . it is now accepted that deg/enacs are trimers  <cit> ; while fanac is a homotrimer  <cit> , hynac is a heterotrimer consisting of three different subunits, hynac <dig>  hynac <dig> and hynac <dig>  <cit> . hynac <dig>  hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> are co-expressed at the base of the tentacles, most likely in epitheliomuscular cells. hydra-rfamides are expressed in neurons from the hypostomal and the peduncle region of hydra  <cit> , where they are contained within large dense core vesicles in axon terminals of neurons contacting epitheliomuscular cells, suggesting that they contribute to neuromuscular transmission in hydra  <cit> . since tentacle curling is delayed by amiloride  <cit> , it has been proposed that hynac is involved in movement of the tentacles  <cit> . while hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> are uniformly expressed at the tentacle base  <cit> , hynac <dig> is restricted to the oral side  <cit> , suggesting that hynac2/3/ <dig> is active only in epitheliomuscular cells at the oral side of the tentacle base. in contrast, hynac <dig> localizes to the aboral side of the tentacles  <cit> . hynac <dig> does not assemble with hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> in a functional channel  <cit> , suggesting the existence of further hynac subunits at the aboral side of the tentacles.

since hydra belongs to the phylum cnidaria, which is a sister phylum to all bilaterians, the distant relation of fanac and hynac suggests that the common ancestor to all deg/enacs might have been a peptide-gated ion channel. alternatively, peptide-gating might have evolved twice independently in the deg/enac gene family. a more definite answer to this question needs a survey of the full repertoire of deg/enacs in hydra to establish whether all deg/enacs in hydra are peptide-gated channels. moreover, the presence of many more neuropeptides in the hydra nervous system  <cit>  and the presence of the precursors that encode hydra-rfamides i and ii  <cit>  at the peduncle region  <cit>  raises the questions of the existence of hynacs that are gated by peptides other than hydra-rfamides i and ii or that are expressed at the peduncle and activated by hydra-rfamides i and ii.

here, we report a comprehensive analysis of the deg/enac gene family in hydra. we show that there is a surprising variety of hynacs and that, with one possible exception, hynacs are heterotrimers and are activated by hydra-rfamides i and ii. some hynacs are expressed at the peduncle where they could mediate fast responses to rfamides i and ii. moreover, we establish the rules by which the deg/enac subunits in hydra assemble into functional peptide-gated channels.

RESULTS
the comprehensive analysis of deg/enacs in hydra
we cloned seven new cdnas coding for proteins with high homology to the known hynacs . we named these proteins hynac <dig> to hynac <dig>  they have a size of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda. in general, the amino acid sequence identity of all hynacs varies between 29% and 65%. the exception is hynac <dig>  which is only 14% to 17% identical to other hynacs. in addition, hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> are 85% identical to each other. phylogenetic analyses revealed that hynac <dig> to hynac <dig> form a group of closely related channels within the deg/enac gene family, suggesting that they derived from a single ancestor. hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> are more closely related to hynac <dig> and hynac <dig>  whereas hynac <dig> to hynac <dig> are more closely related to hynac <dig> and hynac <dig>  respectively, defining two subgroups within the hynac branch . supporting previous results  <cit> , hynac <dig> to hynac <dig> form a monophyletic group with asic and basic . the grouping of hynacs and their relationship to asics and basic is apparent in the maximum likelihood analysis  and confirmed at a higher level of support by bayesian analysis . the striking exception is hynac <dig>  which is isolated from other hynacs or asics and basic . while the genes coding for hynac <dig> to hynac <dig> have introns, the sequence coding for hynac <dig> is present as a single uninterrupted open reading frame in the hydra magnipapillata genome, showing that hynac <dig> is intronless, and suggesting that it derived by retrotransposition early in cnidarian evolution. retrotransposition is relatively common in hydra  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the database contains the first  <dig> amino acids of another predicted protein that shows high homology to hynacs but like hynac <dig>  <cit> , hynac <dig> lacked an initiator methionine and we were not able to clone it from hydra cdna. therefore, we conclude that hynac <dig> is an inactive pseudogene. since extensive screening of the genomic database revealed no further deg/enac homologs, we conclude that hynac <dig> to hynac <dig> constitute the whole deg/enac gene family in hydra magnipapillata.

all hynacs share conserved structures that are typical for deg/enacs: they have short n- and c-termini, two tmds and a large ecd between the tmds  <cit> . sequence motifs that are highly conserved in deg/enacs are also at least partially present in hynacs; examples are the n-terminal hg motif  <cit> , a di-arginine motif right before tmd <dig>  a highly conserved tryptophane in tmd <dig> and the selectivity filter motif ‘gas’ in tmd <dig>  <cit> . conserved cysteine residues in the ecd  <cit>  indicate a conserved tertiary structure .figure  <dig>

new hynacs contribute to a variety of functional ion channels
we tested the function of the new hynacs by co-expression of different hynac subunit combinations in xenopus oocytes. we screened for functional subunit combinations by application of  <dig> μm hydra-rfamide i, a potent agonist of hynac2/3/ <dig>  <cit> . when we expressed an individual hynac subunit we could never elicit currents. similarly, the simultaneous expression of several crna never resulted in functional ion channels when hynac <dig> was absent. when hynac <dig> was part of the injected crna pool, however, hydra-rfamide i elicited currents. simultaneous expression of hynac <dig> with a single other hynac resulted only in a functional channel when we co-expressed hynac <dig> and hynac3; it was already known that hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> form a low-affinity peptide-gated channel  <cit> . expression of hynac <dig> with two other hynacs, however, resulted in several functional ion channels .figure  <dig>

assembly of functional channels followed two simple rules. first, hynac <dig> had to be present. second, one of the other two subunits had to be from subgroup  <dig>  containing hynac <dig> to hynac <dig> and the other one from subgroup  <dig>  containing hynac <dig>  hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> to hynac <dig> as defined by phylogenetic relationship . specifically, hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> formed functional heteromers with hynac <dig> or hynac <dig>  while hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> formed functional heteromers with all hynacs of the second subgroup. hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> formed functional heteromers with all members of the second subgroup except hynac <dig> .

the contribution of the distantly related hynac <dig> to peptide-gated channels was assessed by co-expression with hynac <dig> and one or several other hynacs . in addition, hynac <dig> was co-expressed with pools of different hynacs without hynac <dig>  in no case did this result in channels that could be activated by hydra-rfamide i; in the case of hynac2/ <dig>  current amplitude and apparent peptide affinity were not increased by co-expression of hynac <dig>  we conclude that hynac <dig> does not co-assemble with other hynacs into channels activated by hydra-rfamide i. since the closely related basic can efficiently be opened by lowering the concentration of extracellular divalent cations  <cit> , reduction of extracellular divalent cation concentrations provides a potential means to open hynacs independently of specific agonists. in fact, all hynacs that were activated by hydra-rfamide i were opened by lowering the extracellular ca2+ concentration  to  <dig> nm . moreover, hynac2/9/ <dig>  which was insensitive to hydra-rfamide i, was also opened by lowering e, revealing that this combination of subunits assembles into a plasma membrane expressed ion channel, which was not gated by hydra-rfamide i. in contrast, hynac <dig>  whether expressed alone or in combination with other hynacs, was not opened by lowering e. some deg/enacs are constitutively opened by an amino acid substitution at the so-called deg-position  <cit> . to further investigate whether hynac <dig> forms a functional homomeric channel, we substituted a glycine at the deg-position by threonine , which has a large side chain. this substitution did, however, not constitutively open hynac <dig> . this applies also for the co-expression of hynac12-g436t together with pools of different wild-type hynac subunits, leaving the function of hynac <dig> unknown.figure  <dig>

since hydra-rfamide ii had been shown previously to activate hynac2/3/ <dig>  <cit> , we tested hydra-rfamides ii to v for channel activation. all channels that were activated by hydra-rfamide i were also activated by hydra-rfamide ii . instead hydra-rfamide iii to v  failed to activate any functional hynac heterotrimer as well as hynacs containing hynac <dig> .

expression pattern of hynacs reveals putative physiological subunit combinations
the expression patterns of hynacs were studied by in situ hybridization . it had already been shown that hynac <dig> to hynac <dig> are expressed at the base of the tentacles of adult animals  <cit> . while hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> are uniformly expressed at the tentacle base, hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> are asymmetrically expressed. hynac <dig> is strongly expressed at the oral side of each tentacle base with a gradient toward the aboral side  <cit> , and hynac <dig> expression is restricted to the aboral side of the tentacle base  <cit> . similar to hynac <dig> and hynac <dig>  hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> were asymmetrically expressed at the base of the tentacles . while expression of hynac <dig> was restricted to the oral side, similar to hynac <dig>  expression of hynac <dig> was restricted to the aboral side , similar to hynac <dig>  these findings, together with the formation of functional heteromeric channels in oocytes, suggest the presence of hynac2/3/ <dig> and hynac2/11/ <dig> heterotrimers at the oral side and of hynac2/3/ <dig> and hynac2/4/ <dig> heterotrimers at the aboral side of the tentacle base . the expression pattern is typical for expression in epitheliomuscular cells .figure  <dig> 
hynacs
are expressed at the base of the tentacles or at the peduncle. whole mount in situ hybridizations revealed a diverse expression of different hynacs. hynac <dig> to hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> are expressed at the base of the tentacles, while hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> are expressed at the peduncle. hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> are expressed ubiquitously along the whole body column. note that hynac <dig> is faintly expressed over the whole body column including the peduncle. expression of hynac <dig> could not be detected by in situ hybridization.

the remaining hynacs were not expressed at the base of the tentacles . hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> were expressed at the peduncle , a region slightly above the basal disk. hynac <dig> was also expressed at the hypostome  . hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> were expressed over the whole body column but hynac <dig> had an increased expression level in the peduncle region . since hynac <dig> was indispensable for formation of functional hynacs in the oocyte expression system, we re-evaluated its expression pattern and found slight expression of hynac <dig> over the whole body column including the peduncle . these findings suggest the presence of hynac2/9/ <dig> and hynac2/10/ <dig> heterotrimers at the peduncle region. since neurons expressing the preprohormone a gene that encodes the hydra-rfamides i to iv are present at the tentacle bases, hypostome, upper gastric region and peduncle  <cit> , it is possible that cells expressing hynacs in the peduncle make synaptic junctions with neurons expressing hydra-rfamides.

we were not able to detect hynac <dig> by in situ hybridization , suggesting that this subunit may be expressed in a restricted location or in low abundance. moreover, hynac <dig> expression was faint and rather diffuse and we, therefore, could not assign a putative subunit combination containing hynac <dig>  figure  <dig> summarizes the putative physiological subunit combinations of hynacs.

hynacs have high-affinity for hydra-rfamide i and ii
we determined for hynacs with an overlapping expression pattern, and hence a putative occurrence in vivo, apparent affinity for hydra-rfamide i. hynac2/3/ <dig> has a high ca2+ permeability, which leads to activation of ca2+-activated chloride channels  that are endogenously expressed in xenopus oocytes  <cit> . a biphasic current with an initial peak and a slowly developing sustained phase is indicative for activation of caccs. all new hynacs had the same biphasic current as hynac2/3/ <dig> , suggesting high ca2+ permeability. therefore, we determined apparent affinity for hydra-rfamide i with oocytes that had been injected with the ca2+-chelator ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid . in the presence of intracellular egta, hydra-rfamide i induced simple on- and off-responses, demonstrating that under these conditions currents were not strongly contaminated by currents through caccs. the ec <dig> for hydra-rfamide i varied over more than two orders of magnitude from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  for hynac2/9/ <dig> to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  for hynac2/11/5; for comparison, hynac2/3/ <dig> has an ec <dig> of approximately  <dig> μm  <cit> . for hynac2/10/ <dig>  the apparent affinity for hydra-rfamide i was too low to calculate the ec <dig> precisely, since a saturating ligand concentration could not be reached .figure  <dig>

previously, it had been shown that hynac2/3/ <dig> has a ten times higher apparent affinity for hydra-rfamide ii than for hydra-rfamide i  <cit> . we re-assessed apparent affinity of hynac2/3/ <dig> for hydra-rfamide ii with egta-injected oocytes and found it to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm , slightly lower than reported for oocytes not injected with egta   <cit> . regarding the other putative physiological hynac heterotrimers, the ec <dig> for hydra-rfamide ii varied between  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  for hynac2/9/ <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for hynac2/11/ <dig> , which is in the same range as for hydra-rfamide i. only for hynac2/11/ <dig> was the apparent affinity for hydra-rfamide ii about 15-fold higher than for hydra-rfamide i .figure  <dig>

similar to hynac2/3/ <dig>  <cit> , all hynacs had a slightly positive reversal potential erev in standard bath , suggesting that they are unselective cation channels. hynac 2/3/ <dig> is characterized by a high ca2+ permeability with a permeability ratio pca/pna =  <dig>   <cit> . we investigated the ca2+ permeability of the new hynacs by replacing extracellular na+ by ca2+. an increase in extracellular ca2+ from  <dig> to  <dig> mm resulted in a strong rightward shift of erev , confirming ca2+ permeability of hynacs. the shift was in the same range as for hynac2/3/ <dig>  <cit> , suggesting a comparable ca2+ permeability. we used erev at  <dig> mm ca2+ and at  <dig> mm na+ as the only permeant cations  to calculate the relative permeability pca/pna for the new hynacs. pca/pna ranged from  <dig>  for hynac2/4/ <dig>  to  <dig>  for hynac2/3/ <dig>  , showing that all hynacs are highly ca2+ permeable.figure  <dig>

diminazene is a potent inhibitor of hynacs and inhibits the feeding reaction
one of the hallmarks of deg/enacs is the block by the diuretic amiloride  <cit> . since the apparent amiloride affinity of hynac2/3/ <dig> is quite low with an ic <dig> of approximately  <dig> μm  <cit> , amiloride is of limited utility for the study of hynacs. recently, diminazene and related compounds have been reported to potently inhibit asics and basic but not enac  <cit> . since asics and basic are closely related to hynacs, we asked whether diminazene also inhibits hynacs. for most hynacs,  <dig> μm of diminazene indeed almost completely blocked hynac currents. the ic <dig> for diminazene varied between  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  for hynac2/4/ <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  for hynac2/9/ <dig>  only hynac2/11/ <dig> was blocked by diminazene with a low apparent affinity and an ic <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm . although we did not determine apparent amiloride affinity for all hynacs, based on a 20% to 70% inhibition of currents by  <dig> μm amiloride  one can estimate that diminazene has a >100-fold higher potency than amiloride for most hynacs.figure  <dig>

it has previously been shown that  <dig> μm amiloride delays the feeding reaction of living hydra  <cit> , supporting the hypothesis that amiloride-sensitive channels are involved in the feeding reaction. to find further evidence that amiloride inhibited the feeding reaction via inhibition of hynacs, we repeated these experiments with diminazene. addition of glutathione  induced tentacle contractions and animals moved the tentacles to their mouth. after about two minutes, 100% of animals had their tentacles completely curled. when animals were held in a medium containing  <dig> μm diminazene, tentacle curling was slightly delayed. increasing the concentration of diminazene to  <dig> μm, more strongly and significantly  delayed the initiation of tentacles movement such that tentacles were completely curled only after three minutes. when the concentration of diminazene was further increased to  <dig> μm, it strongly inhibited the feeding reaction such that even after four minutes only 20% of the animals had their tentacles completely curled . although the potency of diminazene in vivo was low, it should be taken into account that septate junctions provide a significant paracellular permeability barrier to the mesogleal space of hydra  <cit> . moreover, it appears that diminazene requires active transport mechanisms for cellular uptake  <cit> , probably strongly limiting its transcellular transport; amiloride in contrast is, in part, uncharged at neutral ph and has a significant membrane permeability  <cit> . it is, therefore, conceivable that diminazene reached significantly lower concentrations in the mesogleal space of hydra than in the bath. therefore, these results support the idea that hynacs are involved in the feeding reaction of hydra.figure  <dig>

discussion
deg/enacs in hydra are peptide-gated
in this study, we characterized the complete gene set of ten deg/enac genes in the model cnidarian hydra. we found genomic evidence for two further transcribed genes, that is, hynac <dig> and hynac <dig>  our data indicate, however, that these are pseudogenes that probably arose by retrotransposition from a common precursor with other hynacs  <cit> . the remaining ten genes give rise to ten hynac subunits that assemble in a variety of combinations into heteromeric ion channels.

hynacs are more closely related to each other than to any other deg/enac, forming a sub-branch on the phylogenetic tree in figure  <dig>  closest relatives are asics  <cit>  and basic  <cit> . hynacs form two lower order subgroups within the hynac branch . subgroup  <dig>  contains hynac <dig>  hynac <dig>  hynac <dig> and hynac <dig>  while subgroup  <dig>  contains hynac <dig>  hynac <dig> and hynac <dig> to hynac <dig>  combinatorial expression of individual hynacs revealed the rules for subunit assembly. hynac <dig> was present in all functional channels. the second subunit had to be from subgroup  <dig> and the third was another subunit from subgroup  <dig>  closely related to hynac <dig>  hynac2/ <dig> is the only hynac that contains only two different subunits yet is functional  <cit> . the presence of a hynac2-like subunit in all other channels makes 2/2/ <dig>  the likely composition of hynac2/ <dig> 

according to the rules described above, hynacs could theoretically assemble in  <dig> different combinations . we found that  <dig> of these combinations are activated by hydra-rfamides i and ii . one other combination  was not activated by hydra-rfamides i and ii but by removing extracellular divalent cations, indicating correctly assembled plasma membrane expressed channels. it is therefore possible that hynac2/9/ <dig> is activated by another neuropeptide than rfamides. since the other four theoretical subunit combinations could neither be activated by rfamide neuropeptides nor by removal of divalent cations, it is likely that these combinations do not assemble in functional ion channels; at least not in the oocyte expression system. with the exception of hynac2/10/ <dig>  the functional peptide-activated channels all had high apparent ligand affinity; for some, such as hynac2/9/ <dig>  nanomolar concentrations of hydra-rfamides i and ii elicited robust currents . the high affinity for rfamides i and ii renders it highly unlikely that other neuropeptides also activate hynacs with similar affinity. we, therefore, conclude that the physiological ligands of hynacs are hydra-rfamides i and ii, with the possible exceptions of hynac2/9/ <dig> and hynac2/10/ <dig>  this conclusion lends support to the hypothesis that the common ancestor of deg/enacs was a peptide-gated channel. a definite answer to this question, however, requires the analysis of deg/enacs from more non-bilaterian animals.

hynacs may contribute to neuromuscular transmission in hydra
for six of the thirteen heterotrimers, which are activated by rfamides in the oocyte expression system, the three subunits are co-expressed . it is therefore likely that these six heterotrimers form peptide-gated channels in situ. due to the limited sensitivity of ish, we cannot exclude that further combinations exist in situ. in particular, we could not assign the locus of expression of hynac <dig>  in summary, our results suggest that two different hynacs are present at the oral  and two at the aboral side of the tentacle base , respectively. two other hynacs are expressed at the peduncle . since these channels are all activated by hydra-rfamides i and ii, this variety is unexpected. we speculate that the variety of hynacs helps to fine tune ligand affinity and perhaps subcellular location of rfamide-gated channels.

what is the function of hynacs? ish from this and previous  <cit>  studies suggests that hynacs are expressed in epitheliomuscular cells, which function as muscle cells. since hydra-rfamides are contained within large dense core vesicles in axon terminals of neurons contacting epitheliomuscular cells  <cit> , our results identify hynacs as a candidate post-synaptic receptor for hydra-rfamides, which could depolarize muscle cells to induce contractions. in agreement with this speculation, amiloride  <cit>  and diminazene, blockers of hynacs, significantly delayed the feeding reaction of hydra . in vertebrates and arthropods, however, neuromuscular transmission uses the small molecule transmitters, acetylcholine and glutamate, respectively. sequencing of the hydra genome indeed revealed seventeen genes coding for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits but other key components of the vertebrate neuromuscular junction are not present in hydra and the authors concluded that a canonical bilaterian neuromuscular junction was not present in the last common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians  <cit> . moreover, it has recently been suggested that striated muscles evolved convergently in cnidarians and bilaterians from cells with ancient contractile machinery  <cit> . assuming that the junction with neurons of striated muscle cells evolved after or at the same time as the evolution of striated muscles, this finding would explain why cnidarian and bilaterian muscles might use different transmitters at their junction with neurons. in summary, our results suggest that hydra-rfamides i and ii and hynacs should be considered as a transmitter-receptor pair mediating fast neuromuscular transmission in hydra.

one feature of hynacs that is unique for deg/enacs is their high ca2+ permeability. if hynacs indeed carried an excitatory post-synaptic current in muscle cells then ca2+ flux through hynacs could directly induce muscle contractions independent of release from intracellular stores. a high ca2+ permeability might also confer an advantage in a freshwater animal like hydra with a low extracellular na+ concentration. in hydra littoralis  an extracellular osmolality of  <dig>  mm/kg has been measured  <cit> , significantly higher than in the surrounding freshwater but much lower than in most other animals. thus, ca2+ may carry a significant fraction of the excitatory current in the freshwater animal hydra.

CONCLUSIONS
our study identifies in hydra a variety of ion channels gated by hydra-rfamide neuropeptides. their expression in epithelial cells at the base of the tentacles and in the peduncle suggests a role for these channels in neuromuscular transmission. thus, our results support the hypothesis that hydra uses neuropeptides for fast neuromuscular transmission.
