BACKGROUND
bulky plant organs such as pome fruit mainly consist of parenchyma tissue, that is important for metabolic processes such as respiration. aeration  <cit>  of the parenchyma is essential to maintain the cellular metabolism of the fruit  <cit> . values of the effective oxygen diffusivity of fruit tissues have been shown to be very low, limiting respiration that could lead to atp deficiency in low oxygen conditions  <cit> . furthermore, significant differences in oxygen diffusivity of fruit parenchyma have been observed between fruit genotypes  <cit> . knowledge of aeration properties thus helps understanding of fruit physiology.

fruit parenchyma can be regarded as a porous medium with air spaces distributed in between the cells. porous media theory states that the effective diffusivity of the tissue can be calculated from molecular diffusivity multiplied with porosity and divided by a tortuosity factor . tortuosity accounts for the fact that gasses follow the meandering network of air spaces in the tissue rather than a straight path. while tissue porosity can be easily measured, tortuosity depends on the structure of the pore network and is more difficult to quantify. usually tortuosity is determined inversely from the measured diffusivity as was already applied to gas diffusion in fruit  <cit> . attempts using different predictive methods for tortuosity from porosity  lead to effective diffusivity values that are orders of magnitude larger than those measured on fresh tissue samples. it is hypothesized that the structure of plant tissue differs significantly from traditional porous media leading to lower effective diffusivity values than theoretically expected. indeed, tissues are not necessarily homogeneous, isotropic and random, and diffusion occurs also through the cells  <cit> . it can be expected that tortuosity then is not a function of porosity but that other structure characteristics play a role. it is unclear which tissue characteristics are determinant. there is thus a need to quantify structural characteristics of cells and voids in the tissues that affect the effective oxygen diffusivity of parenchyma tissue.

plant tissue microstructure has conventionally been visualized using light microscopy  <cit> , possibly with chemical staining  <cit>  or labelling  <cit> , cryo-sem  <cit>  or esem  <cit> . these techniques require invasive sample preparation and/or preprocessing steps that are time consuming and may introduce artefacts in the images. also, as these techniques are essentially based on 2-d slices of images, sample coverage is restricted by the number of sections that are taken. further, the sectioning angle may lead to wrong estimates of cell diameters or other microstructural features such as the connectivity of the intercellular air space  <cit> . confocal laser scanning microscopy allows the production of 3d images with resolutions even beyond the refraction limit. however, even in multiphoton systems their penetration depth is limited to below 1 mm, and high resolution images require fluorescent probes to be inserted in the cells  <cit> .

x-ray micro-computed tomography  has emerged as an attractive 3d imaging tool for plant anatomy research with important advances over other methods . x-ray micro-ct can visualize cells and intercellular spaces of tissue samples that need no other pretreatment than cutting from the fruit and securing in the sample holder of the x-ray ct device, rendering an image at a resolution in the order of  <dig> micrometer in a few tens of minutes. this results in sufficiently high quality images of the intercellular space in between cells, but cell wall boundaries between cells are not resolved. when phase contrast imaging is applied  <cit> , walls may become slightly visible but automatic isolation of individual cells remains impossible and thus have to be segmented by tedious manual operations. as a result, identification and quantification of individual cells is not straightforward, unless contrast is enhanced with staining methods  <cit> , which increases sample preparation times considerably. processing tomographic images of fresh samples in a standardized manner can be a great challenge  <cit> , but is required for quantitative analysis of size, shape and connectivity of cells and voids in between cells. an automated cell analysis algorithm for x-ray tomographic images is not yet available and will enhance the more wide use of the method to assist understanding of aeration of plants.

as a result, although large datasets of microtomography images could be obtained, progress needs to be made with image processing, which is often a major hurdle for any visualization method to be successful. we presumed that x-ray micro-ct images of plant parenchyma tissue outline cell borders touching intercellular spaces sufficiently such that the outline could be completed using this information with advanced image processing techniques.

the aim of the current study was to  develop a method for automatically identifying and characterizing individual cells and voids in 3-d images of parenchyma tissue of apple and pear fruit obtained by desktop and synchrotron x-ray ct; and  to use the method to improve understanding of gas exchange properties of pome fruit parenchyma. the developed methodology is equally applicable to analysis of parenchyma properties in other plant organs. we chose four distinct pome fruit genotypes of economic relevance that have different responses to hypoxic conditions  <cit> . ‘conference’ pear and ‘braeburn’ apple are particularly sensitive to develop storage disorders in low oxygen conditions; ‘jonagold’ is much less sensitive and ‘kanzi’ is a relatively new cultivar that has been little studied. here we verify whether these differences are related to changes in aeration caused by parenchyma tissue structure differences.

RESULTS
characteristics of parenchyma cells in pome fruit cortex
images of fruit cortex parenchyma obtained at 5 μm pixel resolution can resolve characteristic features of the cell architecture and air spaces of apple and pear tissue . by applying the cell isolation protocol we were able to quantify a large amount of individual cells  from each 3d image. this numerical sieve allowed quantitative analysis and statistical testing of differences in cell size and shape, which was previously not possible  <cit> . ‘jonagold’ cells are on average the largest with an equivalent spherical diameter equal to 210 μm, whereas ‘conference’ cells were the smallest  . cell sizes of ‘braeburn’  and ‘jonagold’ do not differ significantly, while ‘kanzi’ apple cells  are similar in size to those of ‘conference’ pear. we were able to fit normal distributions to the measured cell volumes using the algorithm, as plotted in fig.  <dig> . the number density of cortex cells for the different genotypes  have the same statistical differences: ‘kanzi’ and ‘conference’ have a significantly larger number of cells than ‘jonagold’ and ‘braeburn’.fig.  <dig> original x-ray micro ct virtual cross-sectional images of ‘braeburn’ , ‘kanzi’ , ‘jonagold’  and ‘conference’  microstructure, obtained by means of a desktop ct system  or in a large scale synchrotron radiation ct facility . cells and intercellular space are visible in all the images. scale bar indicates 250 μm

the cell shape of the different apple and pear tissues are largely comparable. ‘jonagold’ has the most uniform cell elongation, and ‘kanzi’ has the most variable distribution of cell shapes. the cell-to-void area fraction is not significantly different between the apple cultivars ‘braeburn’ , ‘kanzi’  and ‘jonagold’ . this fraction is, however, much lower for ‘conference’ pear , meaning that less than a quarter of the cell surfaces is exposed to intercellular spaces for gas exchange. this has important consequences with respect to metabolic gas exchange  <cit> .

characteristics of void networks in pome fruit cortex
application of the void isolation protocol resulted in  <dig> to  <dig> voids in each 3d image for detailed quantification beyond previous more qualitative descriptions  <cit> . the size distributions of individual voids show a higher variation compared to those of the cells . the equivalent spherical diameter of the voids ranges from  <dig> to over 500 μm. for the apple cultivars, ‘kanzi’ manifests a relatively larger abundance of small voids, whereas the voids of ‘jonagold’ are by far the largest, and are similar in volume as the cells of that cultivar . the voids that were detected in ‘conference’ pear samples are more uniformly distributed in terms of their size, and are substantially smaller than the voids in apple tissue. all fruit types have significantly different average void diameters.fig.  <dig> cell  and void  volume distributions for ‘braeburn’ , ‘kanzi’, ‘jonagold’  and ‘conference’ , in which the relative distributions of equivalent diameters  are volume weighted . histograms are based on the image processing and analysis of  <dig> individual ct scans of cortex fruit tissue samples. the cells and voids were modelled by a normal distributions , ‘conference’ voids were modelled by a weibull distribution



we successfully fitted normal distributions to the void size histograms  . the void network of ‘conference’ is clearly not normally distributed, due to a large number of small voids, as well as a small number of highly branched large voids, forming a large fraction of the void volume. we attempted to fit a weibull distribution to the histogram, but due to the presence of one very large, interconnected void with an equivalent diameter of about 750 μm in one of the samples the distribution of the fit is not good.

void volume shape characteristics of ‘kanzi’ are more similar to those of pear, while ‘braeburn’ has more irregular voids such as ‘jonagold’. the statistical differences between these two groups of fruit are, however, less pronounced than for cell characteristics. the number of voids per mm <dig>  is significantly higher for ‘conference’ pear  compared to those of the apple samples . the variability in void count is high in all fruit except ‘jonagold’ that has the smallest number of voids. this characteristic is also a measure for connectivity of the network of air spaces in the tissue. a value  <dig> would mean that the air space is a continuous network throughout the tissue. the higher the number, the more disconnected the voids are. clearly all fruit have a significantly disconnected void network, confirming earlier observations  <cit> .

the measured voids, being  <dig> to  <dig> times as long as they are wide, are more elongated  than cells. the estimated void surface shape is significantly larger for ‘jonagold’ than for ‘conference’ pear but not different between apple genotypes. differences are small but suggest that the surface area of individual voids in apple are on average more moulded to fit around cells, and ‘conference’ voids are more tubular. the branching number of the ‘conference’ void system  is significantly higher than that of the apple genotypes . although the global porosity value is lower for pear tissue, it implies that the void network in ‘conference’ is intricately more complex and consists of more connected pathways than for any of the examined apple cultivars.

the void network plots show the essential void architecture and connectivity of the different studied genotypes . it is clear that ‘jonagold’ has the widest voids, with the largest local thicknesses compared to ‘braeburn’ and ‘kanzi’. for ‘conference’ pear, a void network is shown in which the typical configuration with absence of voids around the stone cells can be recognized. more detailed images of the void networks  reveal the distinct microarchitecture of the voids, with a large spread in thickness and connectivity.fig.  <dig> void network models for ‘braeburn’ , ‘kanzi’ , ‘jonagold’  and ‘conference’  showing void topology and void network branching as well as local thicknesses of the voids expressed by the color scale. the arrow in the ‘conference’ image indicates the presence of a stone cells, with a local absence of surrounding voids. details of the void network models for a single void, show the original void volume  and the calculated void network. for these models, large void volumes were chosen to illustrate the void connectivity. the dimensions of the box illustrate the spatial extent of the void network. plots e to h present a single connected void in each of the corresponding void networks in plots a to d, demo,strating variations in size and connectivity



based on the extracted skeletons, we can calculate a theoretical total path length in which metabolic gases can be transported throughout the void networks of the different genotypes. in a cubic millimetre, we estimate that there is 100 mm of path length allocated for gas diffusion in ‘conference’ pear, through the large labyrinth of airspaces in between the cells . the total void length is considerably larger for ‘conference’ and ‘kanzi’ than for ‘braeburn’ and ‘jonagold’. finally, the longer void network in ‘conference’ is accompanied by a high degree of fragmentation. the fragmentation is less in ‘braeburn’ and ‘kanzi’, and lowest in ‘jonagold’.

relation to aeration properties of fruit parenchyma tissue
the most important physiological function of the intercellular space in fruit is to facilitate metabolic gas transport  <cit> . we will now investigate whether the microstructural properties can be related to the different genotypes in terms of gas transport. apparent oxygen diffusivity is a measure for the characteristic rate of exchange of this respiratory gas in cortex tissue of fruit. it has been shown that this parameter significantly affects respiratory metabolism in fruit during postharvest storage  <cit> . oxygen diffusion coefficients for cortex tissue of ‘braeburn’, ‘kanzi’, ‘jonagold’, and ‘conference’, obtained from previous work on the same cultivars  <cit>  are listed in table  <dig>  ‘conference’ has significantly smaller diffusivity values than the apple cultivars. for apple, ‘jonagold’ has the largest diffusivity which is significantly larger than that of the other genotypes.

the relationship between the measured microstructural parameters and effective diffusivity of the tissue is represented graphically in a biplot after principal component analysis . in this pca biplot, the scores represent the apple samples; the correlation loadings the microstructural features and functional property . the latter should be interpreted as vectors starting in the origin and ending in the corresponding symbols. correlation loading vectors that point in the same or opposite direction indicate a large positive or negative correlation; correlation loading vectors that are perpendicular to each other are not correlated at all. if a correlation loading vector points in the direction of a score  then this implies that the latter is characterized by a positive value of the corresponding microstructural feature or biophysical property. correlation loading vectors that end within both concentric circles can be considered as relevant.fig.  <dig> pca biplot of the samples of  <dig> genotypes , showing the location and grouping of the samples in terms of their microstructural characteristics, the measured variables which should be interpreted as vectors with their origin in . correlation loadings () situated between the circles  are considered most important for explaining the variability with respect to the principal components shown. correlation loadings based on literature data () for effective oxygen diffusion are added to the biplot. variables with loadings situated in proximity of each other are correlated. loadings that make a 90° angle are said to be mostly uncorrelated. loadings with an 180° angle are inversely related. in this case, an increased porosity is associated with a lower number of cells and voids, with increased respective volumes. although ‘conference’ samples have low porosity, they are characterized by a high number of voids, with a high degree of branching. microstructural shape determinants such as elongation of cells and voids and anisotropy of the tissue are related to each other, but mostly unrelated to other microstructural descriptors. the first  <dig> pc’s explained 77 % of the total x-variance



the first and second principal component accounted for 56 % and 21 % of the total variability, respectively, which indicates some redundancy in presumably the microstructural features. an increased porosity is associated with a smaller number of cells and voids and with large equivalent diameters. void path length scales with branching number and fragmentation of the voids. although ‘conference’ samples have low porosity, they are characterized by a high number of voids , with a high degree of branching, but low cell-to-void surface area. at the other end of the spectrum, ‘jonagold’ is positioned, while the other apple cultivars have an intermediate position between the two extremes.

microstructural shape determinants such as elongation of cells and voids and anisotropy of the tissue are correlated to each other, but mostly uncorrelated to other microstructural descriptors and functional properties. void connectivity, cell connectivity and cell surface to volume ratio do not appear to play significant roles in determining aeration properties of fruit cortex tissue. the effective oxygen diffusivity is positively correlated to porosity  and the surface area and shape of the voids, and negatively correlates to the number of voids and cells, as well as the number and length of branches in the void network and the degree of fragmentation of the network. the value of effective oxygen diffusivity is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of air . also between genotypes differences cover different orders of magnitude: ‘jonagold’ has the highest average value, followed by ‘kanzi’ and ‘braebrun’; the lowest value is for ‘conference’. considerable variability can also be noticed for each genotype.

correlation formula of effective diffusivity of fruit parenchyma tissue
effective property models exist in the form of parametric equations for two-component materials that account for structural effects for a range of standard structures  <cit> . of these, the effective medium theory  and maxwell-type structure models are more like the structure observed in parenchyma tissue. also these models rely only on porosity and diffusivity in air and cells to compute the effective diffusivity. cellular diffusivity is approximated by the diffusivity of water  multiplied by solubility: do <dig> w⋅r⋅t⋅ho <dig> =  <dig>  × 10− <dig> m <dig> s− <dig>  with do <dig> w =  <dig>  × 10− <dig> m <dig> s− <dig>  r  the universal gas constant, t temperature  and ho <dig>  the henry constant for water. the resulting values of effective diffusivity  are  <dig>  × 10− <dig> m <dig> s− <dig> for ‘conference’,  <dig>  × 10− <dig> m <dig> s− <dig> for ‘kanzi’,  <dig>  × 10− <dig> m <dig> s− <dig> for ‘braeburn’ and  <dig>  × 10− <dig> m <dig> s− <dig> for ‘jonagold’. the resulting values of effective diffusivity approach that of oxygen through the cells and are much smaller than those measured. thus, these approximations over emphasize the cellular diffusion pathway.

new models for effective diffusivity of parenchyma tissue are required and should be a weighted sum of the parallel porous media model  <cit>  and a heterogeneous conductivity model  <cit>  according to the method of  <cit> :  <dig> do <dig> eff=1wdo <dig> effpar+1−wdo <dig> effser   <dig> do <dig> effpar=εdo <dig> a/τ <dig>   <dig> do <dig> effser=1−εdo <dig> w⋅r⋅t⋅ho2+εdo <dig> a3do <dig> w2do <dig> w⋅r⋅t⋅ho2+do <dig> ado <dig> w⋅r⋅t⋅ho2+do <dig> a3do <dig> w⋅r⋅t⋅ho22do <dig> w⋅r⋅t⋅ho2+do <dig> a 

with ε the porosity, τ the tortuosity and w the weighing factor. do <dig> a and do <dig> w are the oxygen diffusivity in air and water, and ⋅r⋅t⋅ho <dig> is the factor accounting for solubility of oxygen in water. a maxwell-eucken formulation  <cit>  is used for the serial contribution in eq.  <dig>  assuming a dispersed volume of voids in a continuous matrix of cells. using the average experimental values of effective diffusivity of each genotype, we can roughly estimate the weighing factor w. the value of w for all apple genotypes is above  <dig> , and for ‘conference’  <dig> . even with relatively high contributions of porous medium diffusion through connected pores, a contribution as low as a few percentages for the series diffusion across cells between disconnected pores can bring the effective diffusivity down with almost  <dig> orders of magnitude. with 35 % in pear, the effective diffusivity drops  <dig> orders of magnitude. the resulting effective value is also very sensitive to the weighing factor, and helps explaining why a high variability of effective diffusivity is observed depending on local degree of connectivity of the void network in tissues.

discussion
tissue structure characterisation by automated processing of x-ray images is possible
plant structure analysis using automated image analysis aims to link genotypes to phenotypes and study plant growth and physiology at several spatial and temporal resolutions. recent software solutions from cell to canopy level studies have been organized in an online database  <cit>  . most common applications are leaf analyses and shoot or root meristems, basically flat or superficial structures, which can be imaged by conventional 2d light, confocal or electron microscopy, and for which 2d area measurements are sufficient to characterize the essential cellular anatomy. however, for imaging and analyzing parenchyma cells of bulky plant organs, it is more challenging to achieve a spatial resolution that is sufficient to resolve characteristic features at certain depths  <cit> . current works have only achieved manual segmentation  <cit>  or using approximate image analysis methods . dhondt et al.  analysed micro ct images of the arabidopsis hypocotyl quantitatively; however, fixation of the sample was needed prior to x-ray ct imaging, after which individual cell volumes could be measured. our method measures actual cell volumes of in vivo samples, as well as that of the intact void space automatically.

the workflow we developed to analyse the 3-d microstructure of plant tissue has been applied successfully to isolate individual cells in their natural state without the need for extensive sample preparation. the methodology is also applicable to sample sizes of an order of magnitude of 1 mm <dig> with currently available desktop x-ray microtomography techniques  <cit> , thus exceeding that of previous attempts with at least  <dig> order of magnitude  <cit> .

the smallest voids  that we observed measured  <dig>  × 10− <dig> mm <dig>  corresponding to  <dig> image voxels. smaller isolated voids were by default removed by the noise filter in processing the images.

even though the sample size was large compared to a typical cell size, it was recognized that relatively large voids may exist in fruit tissue. the used protocol disfavours such void sizes in the range of sample size, as these have a higher probability of intersecting the volume boundaries. larger sample sizes are possible; however, this comes at the expense of reduced image resolution and loss of image quality  <cit> . progress in x-ray ct technology will be required to overcome this limitation. in this study the size already exceeded by more than  <dig> fold that of the representative elementary volume  determined for apple tissue  <cit> . however, this rev was determined for global porosity only, not for evaluating other individual microstructural features, and, therefore, should be revisited. in the case of ‘jonagold’, excluding the boundary-intersecting voids led to 64 % of the void volume being discarded in the analysis, compared to  <dig>   <dig> and 49 % for ‘braeburn’, ‘kanzi’ and ‘conference’. a corrective measure based on assigning a larger weight to larger voids in the counting procedure was, therefore, implemented.

the watershed separation of cells favours the segmentation of regularly shaped spherical cells. the volume fraction of cellular tissue that was removed at different image processing steps is shown in table  <dig>  a large fraction of the tissue volume was removed for touching image borders . a smaller volume of cell material  remained unseparated and was removed for further analysis. the removal of these clustered cells may have affected the results, by excluding the more extreme cell shapes. however, considering the large amount of cells that was obtained from each tissue sample, the results are likely to be representative for the fruit tissue. this was not the case for the void space analysis as the void volume and shape descriptors were measured on the original x-ray ct images, without watershed analysis.table  <dig> remaining volume fraction of cellular tissue at two specific steps in the + image processing protocol for cell isolation. the volume fraction is expressed in terms of the total cellular volume in the unprocessed images. the remaining volume fraction after removing clusters was used for analyzing the individual cells



fragmentation of the void network reduces effective tissue diffusivity up to  <dig> orders of magnitude
although the effective diffusivity is highly correlated to porosity , other tissue-specific characteristics need to be considered. tortuosity is the most obvious choice. using available theoretical porous media models  <cit> , the tissue tortuosity ranges between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the porosity range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  %. as a result, the computed effective diffusivity value will be on average  <dig>  × 10− <dig> m <dig> s− <dig> for ‘jonagold’ and  <dig>  × 10− <dig> m <dig> s− <dig> for ‘conference’, or  <dig> to  <dig> times smaller than the average experimental values. cortex tissue of fruit, and most likely any plant tissue, thus cannot be considered as a conventional porous medium for gas exchange where porosity is the main parameter. the measured void shape factor could also be interpreted as tortuosity . the square of this value could be a fair estimate of the tortuosity factor  <cit> . this leads to high effective diffusivity values for all the genotypes, namely  <dig>  × 10− <dig> m <dig> s− <dig>   <dig>  × 10− <dig> m <dig> s− <dig>   <dig>  × 10− <dig> m <dig> s− <dig> and  <dig>  × 10− <dig> m <dig> s− <dig> for ‘jonagold’, ‘braeburn’, ‘kanzi’ and ‘conference’, respectively. these values are between  <dig> and  <dig> times larger than the experimental values. it must be noted that the void shape factor has a positive correlation with oxygen diffusivity in fig. 5; which does not comply with this porous medium theory. it can thus be possible that this shape factor is not a true indicator of tortuosity or, more likely, that other factors dominate the diffusion process.

the average path length per void ranges from  <dig>  mm for ‘conference’ to  <dig>  mm for ‘jonagold’. thus, in cortex tissues with a thickness of several cm it is very unlikely to find a fully connected aeration network through the voids justifying porous medium diffusion; therefore the porous medium assumption breaks down and disconnectivity of the network must be taken into account. the number of voids per mm <dig> volume indeed expresses the fact that the void network is disconnected. the number ranges from  <dig> per mm <dig> for ‘jonagold’ to  <dig> per mm <dig> for ‘conference’. figure  <dig> clearly shows the significance of this parameter for oxygen diffusivity, along with the fragmentation index of pores.

because the void network is disconnected, diffusion through the cells must be taken into account for effective diffusion in the tissue. the effective diffusivity would simply become zero otherwise as gasses cannot diffuse through the disconnected void network. this explains why the fractional area of cells exposed to the airspaces are positively correlated to effective diffusivity . the larger this property in the tissue, the better gas diffuses across the cell-void interface, which is an important pathway in low porosity tissue with disconnected pores. the value of specific void surface area is indeed high in all genotypes . the equivalent diameters of cell and voids are for the same reason significant parameters. in tissue with disconnected voids, the mechanism of gas diffusion no longer follows a simple parallel mechanism that states that the effective diffusivity is the porosity-weighted sum of the diffusion in the air spaces and the cells, but the relative thickness of voids and cells in a serial layer model are also important. previously proposed parallel model for effective diffusivity of tissue  <cit>  should therefore be improved to include effects of serial diffusion through the cellular or cell wall pathway. such model equation is hypothesized in eq. .

equation  is a new parametric equation for tissue oxygen diffusivity that is presented based on a combination of similar equations already available in the literature and complies with the current observations of measured diffusivity. as such, it does not present a new modeling approach. in the past we have developed and applied a new modelling approach that directly computes the tissue effective diffusivity from the 3d microstructural geometry of the porous structure  <cit> . while this is a validated approach, it relies on the availability of 3d micro-ct images that need to be processed for computational use. furthermore, it is enlightening to quantify which microstructural properties precisely are determinant for the diffusivity. that is now made most clear by, first, the pca analysis, and second, the proposed parametric equation that in principle could be solved without the need for actual microscopic images, but does require the relevant parameters to be determined by imaging or other means.”

it is difficult to find a good correlation between the weighing factor in eq.  and the average structural parameters in table  <dig>  it is clear that it is strongly depended on the fragmentation properties of the void network. rather than developing statistical correlations, significant progress has been made with physical models that compute effective diffusivity directly from tissue structure that matches to experimentally determined values  <cit> . this modeling approach relies directly on 3d computer models of the exact tissue anatomy without a need for tissue structure analysis. such modeling can, however, be further supported using the analysis tool developed here: the statistical properties can be used as a basis to generate virtual tissues for such computational models. different plant tissue generation algorithms are currently being developed for such purpose . also, in other plant aeration studies, the modeling approach has been applied successfully .

relation of tissue properties to hypoxic response of the different fruit genotypes
optimal storage conditions of the genotypes studied here differ considerably. for long-term storage, ‘jonagold’ are conventionally kept at  <dig> kpa o <dig>  kanzi at  <dig> kpa o <dig> and ‘conference’ and ‘braeburn’ at  <dig>  kpa o <dig>  <cit> . indeed, the effect of storage o <dig> partial pressures on the risk of fermentation inside the fruit can be calculated using the values of values oxygen diffusivity in combination with the respective respiration kinetics of the genotype  <cit> . such analysis shows that ‘jonagold’  can be stored at low o <dig> partial pressure, while high o <dig> partial pressures are required for ‘kanzi’, ‘braeburn’ and ‘conference’ .

CONCLUSIONS
the methodology described in this article yields distributions of cell size and shape as well as a quantitative description of tissue architecture and the void network that can lead to better plant anatomy understanding and models. by counting and characterising single cells in in vivo fruit samples and the geometrical information thus obtained, we realized a detailed insight in fruit microstructure in relation to tissue aeration. we found considerable differences of the structural configuration of  <dig> different apple cultivars and the pear cultivar that affected oxygen diffusivity significantly. such microstructural information is valuable for explaining and possibly even predicting gas-exchange related disorders. we propose to use this method as a research tool to create detailed tissue libraries, containing different 3d geometric models , that could be used for generating in silico tissue models to support plant research in general. on a practical note, the protocols presented here were developed in a commercial software for 3d image processing and will require reprogramming when implemented in other environments.
