BACKGROUND
leaf colour mutation occurs commonly in the natural world. there are abundant phenotypes and the mutations can exhibit their effects in any of the different stages of growth. with regard to the classification of leaf colour mutants, numerous different categories have been established. gustafsson classified leaf colour mutants into albino, chlorina, stripe, virescent and zebra  <cit> . later, awan et al. subdivided them into eight classes: albino, xantha, viridis, alboviridis, viridoalbino, xanthaviridis, viridoxantha and striata  <cit> . with regard to the physiological mechanisms involved, leaf colour mutations were divided by falbel and staehelin into total chlorophyll  increase type, total chl deficiency type, chl a deficiency type and chl b deficiency type  <cit> .

to date, the locations of more than  <dig> leaf colour mutations have been determined in rice and have been shown to be distributed across all  <dig> chromosomes. over  <dig> genes involved in leaf colour mutations have been cloned, more than  <dig> of which were found to be chlorina genes. examples of these include oshap3a, oshap3b and oshap3c, which are three yellowing genes that were shown to control chloroplast biosynthesis  <cit> . oscao <dig> and oscao <dig> were both found to encode chl a oxygenase, which is the key enzyme for the catalytic synthesis of chl b  <cit> . ygl <dig> was shown to encode chl synthase, which catalyses conversion of chlorophyllide a into chl a, the final step in the biosynthesis of chl a  <cit> . vyl encodes a protein homologous to the arabidopsis caseinolytic protease p <dig> subunit and is targeted to the chloroplast  <cit> . v <dig> was found to encode a new type of guanylate kinase , which is the key enzyme in guanine metabolic pathways and participates in regulating the transmission of chloroplast development signals to the nucleus  <cit> . ygl <dig> encodes a heme oxygenase, which is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme that catalyses heme degradation  <cit> . v <dig> encodes the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, which controls the rate of synthesis of dna nucleotides and affects dna synthesis and repair  <cit> . there are also chl <dig> and chl <dig>  which respectively encode the chld and chli subunits of mg-chelatase, a key enzyme for chl synthesis and chloroplast development  <cit> . newly identified ygl <dig> gene encoding a putative 3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase family protein might be involved in the synthesis of brassinosteroids, and it shows sequence similarity to human and mouse proteins involved in the synthesis of androgens, progestins, and estrogens  <cit> . recently, another gene, ygl <dig>  an allele of the oschld gene, was identified. the ygl <dig> mutant uses light energy efficiently when compared with the wild-type, which demonstrated that the ygl <dig> protein might promote photosynthesis  <cit> . besides v <dig>  v <dig>  and ygl <dig>  other cloned leaf colour mutation genes were almost directly involved in chl metabolism or chloroplast development.

pyrimidine nucleotides represent one of the most fundamental cellular components with essential functions in multiple cellular processes. they are not only building blocks for nucleic acid synthesis in dividing and elongating tissues, but also participate in lipid and carbon metabolism such as udp-glucose as precursor in sucrose or cell wall biosynthesis. pyrimidine nucleotides are synthesized both from amino acids and other small molecules via de novo pathways, and from preformed nucleobases and nucleosides by salvage pathways. ump kinase which catalyses the phosphorylation of ump to udp, with atp as the preferred donor  <cit>  plays a crucial role in pyrimidine nucleotides de novo synthesis and functions in supplying precursors for nucleic acid synthesis by catalyzing the conversion of ump into their diphosphate form. the functions of ump kinase in cell proliferation and physiology have been widely studied. it has been reported that in both bacteria and yeast, the mutation of ump kinase represses cell proliferation and physiology  <cit> . in addition, giblett et al.  <cit>  has reported that the phenotype of down-regulated ump kinase was similar to the immune defect resulting from adenosine deaminase deficiency. however, in plants, only a few studies on ump kinase have been carried out  <cit> . zhou et al. has demonstrated the arabidopsis thaliana ump/cmp kinase activity by complementation of a saccharomyces cerevisiae ura <dig> mutant  <cit> . the mutation of an arabidopsis prokaryotic ump kinase has defects in psaa/b transcript accumulation and leads to growth and development retardation of the mutant plants  <cit> .

to date, numerous proteins involved in chl biosynthesis and assembly and regulation of the photosystems have been identified, greatly broadening our understanding of their function in crop yield. our knowledge about the function of ump kinase in rice and its function in regulating the photosystems and chl biosynthesis is still limited. here, we report the identification of ygl <dig> , a new leaf colour mutant in o. sativa. the ygl <dig> mutant exhibits abnormal grana lamellae and a yellow-green phenotype. ygl <dig> protein is a nuclear encoded chloroplast targeted protein which shares high sequence similarity with cyanobacterial ump kinase. possible roles of ygl <dig> in regulating photosystem and chl biosynthesis are discussed.

RESULTS
the ygl <dig> gene mutation led to less chl accumulation and destroyed the structure of grana lamellae
a yellow-green leaf mutant, ygl <dig>  derived from a process of ethyl methane sulfonate  mutagenesis and exhibiting a yellow-green leaf phenotype throughout the entire growth period, was identified . its level of chl was significantly decreased throughout the whole growth period, especially at the tillering stage when it was only  <dig>  % of the normal  level. this mutant also had chl reductions of  <dig>  % at the seedling stage and  <dig>  % at the heading stage. more specifically, the levels of both chl a and chl b were significantly lower in ygl <dig> than those in the wt throughout the whole growth period. however, the ratio of chl a/b changed little between the ygl <dig> mutant and the wild-type, with a slight increase in ygl <dig> at the seedling and tillering stages. the decrease in chl level corresponded perfectly to the level of yellowness of the leaves .fig.  <dig> the phenotype, cytology and agronomic traits of the wild-type and ygl <dig> mutant. a: the phenotype at the seedling stage; b: the phenotype at the tillering stage; c: the phenotype at the mature stage; d–e: cytological analysis of the wt; f–g: cytological analysis of ygl8; ch: chloroplast; la: grana lamella; n: nucleus

to investigate whether the ygl <dig> mutation affects chloroplast development, we compared the ultrastructure of chloroplasts in ygl <dig> and the wt at the seedling stage using tem. there were normal cells and chloroplasts in the wt . we also found that the cells in ygl <dig> maintained their structural integrity ; however, the grana lamellae of chloroplasts were clearly intumescent and intricately stacked in ygl <dig> .

most of the main agronomic traits were significantly worse in ygl <dig> than those in the wt, especially plant height, effective panicle number per plant, grain number per panicle, filled grain number per panicle, and seed setting rate; however, 1000-grain weight showed no clear difference .fig.  <dig> the agronomic traits of the wild-type and ygl <dig> mutant. a–f: the main agronomic traits of wt and ygl <dig>  error bars represent standard deviation  of three biological repeats; ** indicates significantly different compared with the corresponding wt at p <  <dig>  by the student’s t test



photosynthetic capacity was affected by the mutation of ygl8
photosynthetic parameters were analysed at the heading stage using an li- <dig> portable photosynthesis meter . in ygl <dig>  the stomatal conductance was just  <dig>  mol h2o m− <dig> s− <dig>  which was only  <dig>  % of the value in the wt , and the intercellular co <dig> concentration was  <dig>  μmol co <dig> m− <dig> s− <dig> in ygl <dig> but  <dig>  μmol co <dig> m− <dig> s− <dig> in the wt . the photosynthetic rate was significantly decreased in ygl <dig> compared with that in the wt . furthermore, the transpiration rate was  <dig>  mol h2o m− <dig> s− <dig>  significantly lower than that of the wt . all of these findings indicated that the photosynthetic capacity was deficient in ygl <dig> fig.  <dig> comparison of stomatal conductance, intercellular co <dig> concentration, photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate between wt and ygl <dig> at the heading stage. error bars represent standard deviation  of three biological repeats; ** indicates significantly different compared with the corresponding wt at p <  <dig>  by the student’s t test



the ygl <dig> gene encodes a ump kinase on chromosome 1
genetic analysis showed that the yellow leaf phenotype in ygl <dig> is controlled by a single recessive nuclear locus with a segregation ratio of  <dig>  . to map the ygl <dig> locus,  <dig> pairs of ssr markers evenly distributed in the rice genome were selected to screen for polymorphism among the parents and the gene pools. rm <dig> and rm <dig> revealed polymorphism among the parents and the gene pools, respectively. by using 452 f <dig> recessive plants, the ygl <dig> gene was first mapped to the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  between rm <dig> and rm <dig>  to narrow down its location, more than 9000 f <dig> plants, of which  <dig> were recessive, were used for fine mapping. more than  <dig> in-del markers and ssr markers were designed, five of which were polymorphic. finally, we mapped the ygl <dig> gene to a 54-kb genomic region between in-del marker id- <dig> and ssr marker rm <dig>  and ygl8 co-segregated with in-del marker id- <dig> . within the target region,  <dig> orfs were identified using the gramene website . among the  <dig> orfs sequenced, only loc_os01g <dig> carried a mutation, a single-nucleotide transition , on the fifth exon at the position 671 bp from the atg start codon, which resulted in an amino acid change from ala- <dig> to val  when compared with the wild-type. a search of the rice genome database reveals that loc_os01g <dig> consists of seven exons and six introns, with a total length of 4177 bp. the 1056 bp cds encodes a ump kinase with  <dig> amino acids . therefore, we tentatively assigned loc_os01g <dig> as the ygl <dig> gene.fig.  <dig> map-based cloning and characterisation of ygl <dig>  ygl <dig> was located on chromosome  <dig> between in-del marker id- <dig> and ssr marker rm <dig> and co-segregated with in-del marker id-13

for the further validation of ygl <dig>  genetic complementation was carried out by introducing a  <dig> bp genomic fragment of wt into ygl <dig> plants. as expected, the yellow-green leaf phenotype was not observed in any ygl8-c transgenic line . furthermore, the level of chl was restored to the level in the wt . confirming that disruption of the ygl <dig> gene was responsible for the ygl <dig> mutant phenotype, rnai transgenic plants showed a yellow-green leaf phenotype in which the total chl level was clearly decreased . qrt-pcr analysis revealed that the expression of ygl <dig> was markedly reduced in these transgenic lines compared with that in zhonghua <dig> plants . together, these results confirmed that loc_os01g <dig> indeed corresponded to the ygl <dig> gene.fig.  <dig> identification of ygl <dig>  a: the phenotype of the wt and a complementation  plant; b: the total level of chl in wt and ygl8-c plants; c: the phenotype of the wt  and a rnai plant; d: the expression levels of ygl <dig> in wt  and rnai plants; e: the total level of chl in wt  and rnai plants; error bars represent standard deviation  of three biological repeats; ** indicates significantly different compared with the corresponding wt at p <  <dig>  by the student’s t test



ygl <dig> protein belongs to a highly conserved protein family
the predicted ygl <dig> polypeptide consisted of  <dig> amino acids with a chloroplast transit sequence of  <dig> amino acids at the n-terminus. thus, the mature protein had a predicted molecular weight of approximately  <dig>  kda. subcellular location analysis in the rice protoplast indicated that the ygl <dig> protein functioned in chloroplasts . multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis indicated that ygl <dig> contained a conserved domain of a ump kinase and shared significant similarity with other eukaryotic nuclear-encoded ump kinases and their ancestral prokaryotic ump kinases . most notably, in the conserved domain, ygl <dig> shared significant similarity with the conserved domain of cyanobacterial ump kinases, including those of chroococcales cyanobacterium cena <dig>  anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> and nostoc punctiforme .fig.  <dig> subcellular location of the ygl <dig> protein. ygl <dig> protein was targeted to the chloroplast

expression patterns of ygl8
qrt-pcr was applied to examine the expression pattern of ygl <dig> in wt and ygl <dig> mutant plants. at the booting stage, ygl <dig> was strongly expressed in leaf blades, while it was weakly expressed in the other tissues examined , the same results were obtained by semi-qpcr . furthermore, there was no clear difference in ygl <dig> expression in leaf blades between the wt and the ygl <dig> mutant at the seedling, tillering and booting stages , which may indicate that the single amino acid mutation from ala to val in the ygl <dig> protein caused by the single base mutation from c to t in the ygl <dig> gene has no effect on the mrna level.fig.  <dig> expression of ygl <dig> at different stages and in different tissues. a–b: expression of ygl <dig> in different tissues. c: expression of ygl <dig> in the first leaves from the top at different growth stages; error bars represent standard deviation  of three biological repeats



ygl <dig> affected the expression of genes related to chloroplast development and the photosynthetic system
we addressed the issue of whether the ygl <dig> mutation affected the transcription of other genes associated with chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis. the results of qrt-pcr showed that the expression levels of genes involved in chl biosynthesis, such as hemc, heme and pora, were significantly reduced, at only  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the levels in the wt, respectively, and the expression levels of chld, chlm and chlg were approximately half those in the wt. however, when compared with the wild type, the expression level of cao was slightly increased in the ygl <dig> mutant . interestingly, in the ygl <dig> mutant, most of the expression levels of chloroplast genome encoded genes which we have examined were significant lower than those of the wild type to a different extent. especially, three genes encoding photosystem reaction centre polypeptides, psaa, psab, and psbc were reduced in ygl <dig>  at only  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the expression levels in the wt, respectively. in addition, the expression levels of psba, psbb, psbf, petb, petd, atpa, and rbcl in the ygl <dig> mutant were lower than those in the wild type, but the decreasing extent of corresponding gene was not high .fig.  <dig> the expression of different genes. a: the expression of chl biosynthesis-related genes; b: the expression of chloroplast genome encoded genes; error bars represent standard deviation  of three biological repeats; ** indicates significantly different compared with the corresponding wt at p <  <dig>  by the student’s t test



discussion
recently, substantial research has shown that leaf colour mutants are ideal for shedding light on the mechanisms of plant photosynthesis, the chl biosynthesis pathway, the structure and function of chloroplasts, and crop agronomic traits  <cit> . in this study, using fine mapping, we identified a yellow-green leaf gene, ygl <dig>  which is located near the telomere of the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  and encodes a ump kinase . no other mutated genes located in that area of chromosome  <dig> was identified by map-based cloning and none of the other cloned genes encoded a ump kinase. therefore, ygl <dig> was identified as a novel gene that controls the development of leaf colour in rice.

ygl <dig> protein may have evolved from cyanobacterial ump kinase and regulate the ump/ump/utp level in chloroplasts
it is generally accepted that all chloroplasts are derived from a single cyanobacterial ancestor via the process of endosymbiosis  <cit> . during evolution, almost all cyanobacterial genes retained by eukaryotes relocated to the cell nucleus  <cit> . therefore, the vast majority of chloroplast proteins are now imported as products of nuclear genes that encode chloroplast-targeted precursors synthesised on cytosolic ribosomes  <cit> . since nuclear-encoded ygl <dig> is targeted to chloroplasts and shows high similarity to a homologous cyanobacterial protein, the ygl <dig> gene might also have moved from the chloroplast to the nuclear genome of rice over the course of evolution. this would be consistent with the results of puthiyaveetil et al.  <cit> , who showed that the gene for the chloroplast sensor kinase moved from chloroplasts to the nuclear genome in arabidopsis during evolution. research has shown that in plants, as the building blocks of dna and rna synthesis, all pyrimidines within the cell are derived from ump,  <cit> . ump kinase is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyses the phosphorylation of ump to udp, with atp as the preferred donor  <cit> . the roles of pyrimidine monophosphokinases in cell growth and proliferation have been widely studied. for example, in escherichia coli, the product of the ump kinase gene  has been shown to influence cell proliferation. the smba mutant showed decreased macromolecular synthesis, hypersensitive to sds and a novel morphological phenotype under nonpermissive conditions  <cit> . in addition, in yeast, mutations in the ump kinase gene have been shown to cause declines of 90 % in utp and ctp, which affects both rna and protein synthesis and ultimately results in cell death  <cit> . in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana, it was reported that mutants of chloroplast-targeted ump kinase  failed to grow photo-autotrophically  <cit> . here, we identified that the ygl <dig> gene encodes a chloroplast ump kinase. the amino acid mutation from ala to val near the ump binding site in the mutant protein  might affect the enzyme activity of ygl <dig> and have a negative effect on the chloroplastic utp pool, although this remains to be examined. these results indicate that nuclear-encoded and chloroplast-targeted ygl <dig>  of cyanobacterial ancestry, may function in regulating the chloroplast utp pool and influence chloroplast-encoded gene expression.

mutation of ygl <dig> indirectly affects the expression of some nuclear-encoded chlorophyll biosynthesis-related genes
chlorophyll plays a significant role in plant development and crop yield  <cit> . chl metabolism has been extensively studied in various organisms by both biochemical  <cit>  and genetic approaches  <cit> . mutants with a deficiency in the ability to synthesize chl, including chlh, chld, chli and chlg, exhibit growth defects and/or reduced yield to different extents  <cit> . in this study, we observed that the mutation of ygl <dig> affected the mrna expression of some genes involved in chl biogenesis: among the genes tested, the expression of hemc, heme, chld, chlm, pora and chlg was reduced to different extents . this might be the main factor that led to the decreased chl a level in the ygl <dig> mutant . one of the most important components of the light-harvesting pigment protein complexes of ps i and ps ii, chl b, is synthesised by cao, which was reported to convert chlorophyllide a  into chlide b, most likely by two-step oxygenation  <cit> . although the ygl <dig> mutant retained a slightly increased mrna level of cao comparable to that of the wt , its chl b level was markedly lower . the main reason for this reduced chl b content might be the significant blockage in chl a biosynthesis. it has been reported that the ratio of chl a/b is closely related to the mrna levels of cao in arabidopsis  <cit> . however, the ratio of chl a/b  remained unchanged with a slightly increased cao expression level. this might also be a consequence of decreased both chl a and chl b levels in the ygl <dig> mutant. these results suggest that ygl <dig> may function in influencing chl a and chl b biosynthesis.

mutation of ygl <dig> affects the expression of some chloroplast-encoded genes
in eukaryotes, the two largest polypeptide subunits of ps i, psaa and psab, both encoded by the plastome, form a heterodimer and bind to the primary electron donor of ps i, p <dig>  <cit> . it has been reported that mutants lacking the psaa/b dimer generally failed to assemble the entire ps i core complex, although some peripheral subunits could still accumulate in the thylakoid membranes  <cit> . in the ygl <dig> mutant, the level of psaa and psab transcripts was found to be severely impaired , which implied that ygl <dig> might also fail to assemble a functional ps i core complex, which would affect its photosynthesis. and this is consistent with the findings of hein et al.  <cit> , which showed that the dpt1- <dig> mutant of a. thaliana failed to grow photoautotrophically because of a reduced psaa and psab mrna level. three genes of the chloroplast genome, psba, psbb, psbc and psbf, encoding d <dig> protein, cp <dig> protein, cp <dig> protein, and cytochrome b <dig> of the photosystem ii reaction centre, respectively  <cit> , exhibited different degrees of lower gene expression in the ygl <dig> mutant . besides, other plastome-encoded genes, petb, petd, atpa, and rbcl, encoding cytochrome b <dig>  subunit iv of cytochrome b/f complex, atpase alpha subunit, and rubisco large subunit, respectively  <cit> , showed lower expression level in the ygl <dig> mutant, in spite that the decreasing degree is not high . thus, we suggest that the mutation of chloroplast-targeted ump kinase in the ygl <dig> mutant may affect the chloroplast utp pool, which leads to the changing mrna level of chloroplast genome encoded genes. chloroplast thylakoid membranes are the main structure of energy transformation in plants. the four major functional membrane protein complexes of thylakoid membranes: the photosystem i and ii, the cytochrome b/f complex, and atpase, act cooperatively to transfer light energy into available chemical energy  <cit> . reduced expression level of thylakoid membrane genes in the ygl <dig> mutant which we have examined may lead to the abnormal structure  and function  of chloroplast thylakoid membranes. these results reveals that ygl <dig> may affect thylakoid membrane structure and function by influencing chloroplast genome encoded thylakoid membrane constitutive genes.

it is not yet fully understood why the mutation of chloroplast-targeted ygl <dig> affects nuclear-encoded chl biosynthesis-related genes dramatically, and ultimately leads to a decline in the level of chl in the ygl <dig> mutant. according to the recent reports and reviews on plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signaling, it is clear that the expression of nuclear genes for plastid proteins is affected by the development and/or metabolic state of chloroplast  <cit> . thus, one possible explanation might be that abnormal thylakoid membrane development resulted from the mutation of chloroplast-targeted ump kinase by influencing the mrna level of chloroplast genome encoded genes may inhibit chl biosynthesis-related gene expression by plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signaling.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a rice leaf yellowish mutant, ygl <dig>  was identified by screening of an ems-induced mutant pool. by a map-based cloning method, the mutation of ygl <dig> was shown to be located in a 54-kb genomic region between indel marker id- <dig> and ssr marker rm <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  furthermore, a nucleotide mutation from c to t in loc_os01g <dig> was identified. by transgenic complementation and rnai methods, loc_os01g <dig> was confirmed to be ygl <dig>  the nuclear-encoded chloroplast-targeted ygl <dig> protein contains a conserved ump kinase domain and shares sequence similarity with ump kinases of eukaryotic and prokaryotic  origins. the mutation of ygl <dig> had a negative impact on the expression of chloroplast genome-encoded thylakoid membrane constitutive genes, which affected the grana lamella structure and reduced the chlorophyll level, resulting in the yellowish phenotype, a reduced photosynthetic rate and poor yield characteristics. for further identification of the function and mechanism of action of the ygl <dig> protein, the following additional work is required: confirming the enzyme activity of ygl8; detecting and comparing the levels of utp, udp and ump between the wt and the ygl <dig> mutant; and testing the expression of other genes that may be regulated by ygl <dig>
