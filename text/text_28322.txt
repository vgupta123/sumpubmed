BACKGROUND
pythium species are ubiquitous fungal-like organisms in the kingdom straminipila. they are related to the oomycete plant pathogens phytophthora and downy mildews  in the peronosporales and to saprolegnia and aphanomyces in the saprolegniales. they differ from the true fungi  in that they are diploid, have coenocytic hyphae containing β-1– <dig> glucans and cellulose in their cell walls, reproduce sexually by fertilization of oogonia by antheridia and, in many species, form motile, biflagellate zoospores. nevertheless, pythium species have many similarities to true fungi in the way they obtain nutrients from the environment or attack plants  <cit> .

the genus pythium is biologically and ecologically diverse. although approximately  <dig> pythium species have been described, only half that number has been recognized as valid descriptions  <cit> . pythium species have been divided into  <dig> phylogenetic clades based on rdna its and other sequence data  <cit> . most are soil inhabitants although some reside in salt water estuaries and other aquatic environments. most pythium species are saprophytic or facultative plant pathogens  <cit> . they are among the most important plant pathogens and cause a variety of diseases including seed rots and damping-off, root, stem and fruit rots, foliar blights and postharvest decay  <cit> . a few non-phytopathogenic species show promise as biological control agents  <cit> . other pythium species are parasites of insects  <cit>  and fish  <cit>  and at least one species  can infect animals and causes skin and bone lesions in pigs, dogs, and humans  <cit> .

pythium ultimum is a cosmopolitan plant pathogen with a broad host range. it is one of the most pathogenic pythium species on corn, soybean, wheat, ornamentals, and many other crops  <cit> . it is homothallic, and in most cases, self fertile, although some outcrossing may occur  <cit> . p. ultimum is actually a species complex with three main morphological types. p. ultimum var. ultimum, the most common type, produces oospores but very rarely sporangia and zoospores, and then only at cool temperatures  <cit> . it is part of a large uniform clade based on rdna its sequence comparisons which includes the neotype strain  <cit>  as well as the isolate used to generate the expressed sequence tags  in this study. p. ultimum var. sporangiiferum produces oospores and sporangia at room temperature  <cit> . in barr et al.  <cit> , the four p. ultimum var. sporangiiferum isolates formed a unique genotype  based on isozyme analysis whereas in francis et al.  <cit>  the two isolates of this variety were in two distinct genotypes, one belonging to the most common genotype of p. ultimum var. ultimum strains. it is unclear at this point whether or not the more infrequent but unique genotypes of p. ultimum such as the genotype u <dig> should be split into different species, reducing the observed genetic diversity within this species. having more information on single nucleotide polymorphisms would help to delineate gene flow and species boundaries in this ubiquitous species complex. isolates in the third morphological type do not produce oospores in culture but can be identified based on other morphological characteristics, molecular studies, and the fact that they can be crossed with oospore producing strains of p. ultimum  <cit> .

ests are a robust method for gene discovery and for identifying transcripts involved in specific biological processes. ests have been developed for over  <dig> oomycete and fungal pathogens  <cit> . for the oomycetes, est projects have provided not only the first insight into the gene complement for these plant pathogens but also sets of genes involved in a number of biological processes  <cit> . with the advent of reduced costs and higher throughput sequencing methods, ests can be economically generated for a wider range of organisms and a greater breadth of conditions, thereby providing a more comprehensive assessment of an organism's transcriptome. one emerging platform for de novo sequencing of transcriptomes or genomes is pyrosequencing  <cit> . however, the pyrosequencing-derived read lengths on the gs <dig> and flx platform are substantially shorter than conventional sanger-based sequencing which is problematic for assembly into a non-redundant set of consensus sequences. this limitation can be addressed through increased sequencing coverage of the transcriptome and/or through hybrid approaches in which conventional sanger sequences are co-assembled  <cit>  with pyrosequencing-derived sequences. thus, for de novo sequencing of a transcriptome, both approaches are advantageous with pyrosequencing providing a deep representation of the transcriptome and sanger-derived sequences providing seed sequences for assembly purposes. in this study, we report the first set of ests for this agriculturally important plant pathogen and provide a direct comparison of gene discovery that can be obtained with two high throughput sequencing methods, sanger-based chain termination and  <dig> flx pyrosequencing.

RESULTS
sanger-based sequencing of a normalized cdna library
a normalized cdna library was generated from rna isolated from hyphae growing on two contrasting media conditions, nutrient-rich and nutrient-starved conditions. a total of  <dig>  reads from sanger-based sequencing was generated; these assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences  with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides and a total length of  <dig>  mb . the majority of assemblies contain two component reads while very few assemblies contain six or more component reads . overall, clustering and assembly of the reads resulted in a two-fold reduction in the number of unique sequences with few est components per assembly consistent with an effective normalization treatment of the cdna prior to library construction. we confirmed the origin of the ests by aligning the assemblies to a draft p. ultimum br <dig> genome sequence  <cit> . for the sanger-only assembly,  <dig>   sequences  aligned to the draft genome. of the  <dig>  unique sequences,  <dig>   had sequence similarity with an entry in the uniref <dig> database  <cit> . within the set of  <dig>  unique sequences ,  <dig>  open reading frames  could be predicted. of these,  <dig>  orfs contained an atg translational start codon while  <dig>  had both an atg start codon and a stop codon. of these  <dig>  orfs,  <dig>   have sequence similarity with a protein sequence in the uniref <dig> database that contains the corresponding start codon and are thus potentially full-length. the length of top uniref <dig> matches ranged between  <dig> to > <dig> amino acids in length, indicating that the sequences and therefore the cdnas generated from this library were not biased towards either long or short sequences.

 <dig> pyrosequencing sequencing and assembly
a single half-plate pyrosequencing run on the same normalized cdna used in the sanger-based sequencing generated  <dig>  reads, which after trimming and cleaning, yielded  <dig>  usable reads  with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides and a total length of  <dig>  mb . after clustering and assembly using the tgicl clustering utilities  <cit> ,  <dig>  sequence reads were incorporated into  <dig>  assemblies and  <dig>  singletons for a total of  <dig>  unique sequences. assemblies had an average length of  <dig> bp with a maximum length of  <dig>  bp . for the  <dig> assembly,  <dig>   sequences  aligned to the draft p. ultimum br <dig> genome sequence. of these  <dig>  unique sequences,  <dig>   had a protein match with uniref <dig>  <cit> , significantly less than what was observed for the sanger-derived ests. if only sequences >  <dig> bp were considered, 71% had a match with an entry in uniref <dig> suggesting that the short length of the  <dig> reads impact the ability to detect similar sequences. as the pyrosequencing library preparation involves random shearing of the normalized  cdna population  <cit> , the pyrosequencing reads originate from random locations within each cdna and may have either orientation. the majority of assemblies contain 2– <dig> reads, while in contrast only a few of the assemblies contained over  <dig> pyrosequencing est reads . this is presumably due to both the length of the individual reads, the normalization of the cdna population, and the coverage of the transcriptome represented in this dataset.

hybrid assembly of sanger and pyrosequencing-based reads
a hybrid assembly was constructed using the pyrosequencing- and sanger-based est reads which were clustered and assembled using the tgicl clustering utilities  <cit> ; of these,  <dig>  were assemblies and  <dig>  were singletons for a total of  <dig>  unique sequences . since the reads used in the hybrid assembly were predominantly derived from the pyrosequencing dataset, with the exception of the maximum assembly length, the assembly length and est component statistics are similar to that for the pyrosequencing-only reads . in the hybrid assembly, a majority of assemblies are short with an average length of  <dig> base pairs ) and contain few component reads . the majority of assemblies contain 2– <dig> est reads while only a limited number of assemblies contain over  <dig> est reads. for the hybrid assembly,  <dig>   sequences  aligned to the draft p. ultimum br <dig> genome sequence. within the hybrid assembly,  <dig>  had a protein match using uniref <dig>  <cit>  significantly less than what was observed for the sanger-derived ests yet consistent with the abundance of  <dig> reads in the overall hybrid assembly. if only sequences >  <dig> bp within the hybrid assembly were considered, 69% had a match with an entry in uniref <dig>  pyrosequencing using the  <dig> platform is reported to have reduced accuracy in homopolymer regions  <cit> . examination of homopolymer regions  detected between the sanger- and the 454-derived reads revealed differences in homopolymer length between the sanger and 454-reads in  <dig> instances, primarily in a or t homopolymer regions .

a total of  <dig>  unique sequences in the hybrid assembly were derived from sanger sequencing alone. although the majority of these had no similarity with entries in the uniref <dig> database ,  <dig>  of them mapped to the pythium genome at very high stringencies , suggesting that these are not contaminants or artifacts within the cdna library. of the  <dig>  unique sequences derived solely from sanger reads,  <dig> had no match even at a very low threshold  with the pyrosequencing-derived sequences. further analysis of these  <dig> sanger-only reads showed that  <dig>  could be mapped to the pythium genome with high stringency . an analysis of average read length revealed that these sanger sequences were slightly shorter on average  than the complete set of sanger sequences which would reduce to the probability of co-assembling with  <dig> reads during the hybrid assembly process . although the gc content did not differ substantially between the sanger-only sequence set and the complete sanger sequence set , other sources of possible bias could be the cloning and replication in e. coli which may amplify select sequences in the library compared to the  <dig> sequences. these results suggest that a small proportion of ests generated by sanger sequencing are not present in the dataset generated by pyrosequencing.

biological features of the p. ultimum transcriptome
the top  <dig> assemblies containing the most ests from all three builds  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  ests . most of the protein matches to the top  <dig> assemblies from all three builds were to phytophthora species. in general, the most common annotations based on similarity to uniref <dig> entries were housekeeping genes although  <dig> of the top  <dig> deepest assemblies from the hybrid assembly had no match to an entry in uniref <dig> .

to determine how similar the p. ultimum transcriptome is to other plant pathogenic oomycetes, we compared our est sequences with the predicted proteomes and transcriptomes available for four phytophthora species: p. infestans , p. parasitica , p. ramorum , and p. sojae   <cit> . using blastx with the predicted proteome data sets,  <dig>   of the p. ultimum hybrid assembly sequences matched a sequence present within the p. infestans, p. ramorum, or p. sojae predicted proteomes. using tblastx with a cutoff criterion of e = 1e- <dig>   <dig>   of the p. ultimum hybrid sequences matched a sequence within the three phytophthora transcriptomes with only  <dig>  of the p. ultimum sequences that align with a predicted phytophthora protein not matching a phytophthora transcript. using blastx with a cutoff criterion of e = 1e- <dig> against the uniref <dig> database,  <dig>   of the p. ultimum hybrid sequences matched the uniref database, of which  <dig>  did not also match a phytophthora transcript or predicted protein. collectively, from all three datasets ,  <dig>   of the p. ultimum hybrid sequences do not have a match. this is most likely attributed to the short nature of the majority of the hybrid sequences. indeed, if only sequences ≥  <dig> bp within the hybrid assembly are considered , the percentage of sequences with an alignment to the three data types significantly increases;  <dig>   align to the phytophthora spp. predicted proteomes,  <dig>   align to the phytophthora spp. transcriptomes, and  <dig>   align to the uniref database, with only  <dig>  without a match to any sequence within these data sets.

we also performed a comparative analysis of gene ontologies  <cit>  with p. ultimum and the three phytophthora proteomes. as shown in figure  <dig>  the normalized cdna obtained from hyphae grown in rich and nutrient-starved conditions encoded a broad set of transcripts represented within the molecular function gene ontologies. furthermore, the representation is very similar to that of the complete proteomes of the three plant pathogenic phytophthora species suggesting that our approach of cdna normalization, coupled with deep sequencing, provided a near complete representation of the p. ultimum transcriptome.

it recently emerged that phytophthora and downy mildew species secrete a vast repertoire of effector proteins that modulate host defenses and enable pathogenicity  <cit> . the extent to which pythium species also rely on secreted effectors to colonize host tissue is unclear. we therefore examined the p. ultimum ests for similarity to known oomycete effectors. we first scanned the p. ultimum est hybrid assembly for candidate cytoplasmic effectors of the rxlr and crinkler  families  <cit>  using a combination of the pexfinder algorithm  <cit>  to identify putative secreted protein genes and sequence similarity searches. an hmm profile based on an alignment of known rxlr-eer effectors  <cit>  revealed one p. ultimum assembly  as a putative positive. p. ultimum asmbl_ <dig> encodes an orf with a signal peptide  followed by the rllrsagdvessavddaar sequence with similarity to the rxlr-deer motif . the identification of only a single putative rxlr effector is surprising and contrasts to the common occurrence of rxlr effectors in similar sets of phytophthora ests  <cit> . apparently, rxlr effectors are not as widely present or expressed in p. ultimum as noted for phytophthora species. there are several possible explanations. it is possible that p. ultimum does not have rxlr effector genes or has a highly reduced set compared to phytophthora. this would be consistent with observations  <cit>  that suggested that rxlr effectors are delivered through haustoria, specialized infection structures that are not produced by pythium. the rxlr motif is similar in sequence, position and function to the plasmodium pexel/host translocation motif  <cit> . the possible absence of rxlr effectors in p. ultimum indicates that although the motif is conserved across divergent parasitic eukaryotes it may not be ubiquitous in oomycetes. four crinkler-like sequences were identified among the p. ultimum hybrid assembly. in this case, the similarity to phytophthora crinklers was more convincing than for the single rxlr effector candidate with blastx e values as low as e- <dig>  clearly, these sequences displayed the consensus lxlylaxr instead of the lxlflak motif that defines canonical phytophthora and downy mildew crinklers  <cit>  . in summary, we detected one potential candidate rxlr and several crinkler effectors in p. ultimum, however, they are not as abundantly represented among the examined p. ultimum ests as they are in phytophthora ests from similar developmental stages  <cit> .

we also searched the p. ultimum assemblies for similarities to other oomycete effectors. we detected three assemblies with similarity to oomycete kazal-like serine protease inhibitors  <cit>  and another three with similarity to cystatin-like protease inhibitors  <cit>  . in phytophthora, these apoplastic effectors are known to inhibit defense related proteases of plants  <cit> . in addition, at least  <dig> assemblies with similarity to elicitins were identified . elicitins are secreted lipid-binding oomycete proteins that trigger defense responses in plants  <cit> . these elicitins showed significant similarity to previously described phytophthora and pythium elicitins with their characteristic cysteine-rich domain  <cit> . six assemblies were most similar to sylvaticin, a secreted elicitin of pythium sylvaticum of unknown function  <cit> . the same assemblies showed significant similarity with the elicitin-like protein of pythium oligandrum  <cit>  but the homology was much lower than that of p. sylvaticum . this is consistent with the taxonomy and phylogeny of these species. both p. ultimum  and p. sylvaticum  belong to the globose sporangia group of pythium whereas p. oligandrum  belongs to a different group with contiguous sporangia  <cit> .

unlike phytophthora spp., pythium and other oomycetes like saprolegnia spp. are not thiamine auxotrophs. torto et al.  <cit>  reported sequences with similarity to thiamine biosynthesis enzymes among ests of the fish pathogen saprolegnia parasitica that are missing in the genome sequences of p. sojae, p. ramorum, p. infestans, and hyaloperonospora parasitica. we identified four p. ultimum sequences within the hybrid assembly  with similarity to the s. parasitica thiamine biosynthesis enzyme. this finding is consistent with the knowledge that p. ultimum can synthesize thiamine. the thiamine biosynthesis gene was apparently lost during the evolution of the phytophthora/downy mildews lineage and could serve as a potential phylogenetic marker among saprolegniales and the genus pythium.

oomycetes are often characterized by the ultrastructure of their flagellar apparatus. although the strain we sequenced and p. ultimum var. ultimum are generally not known to produce zoospores in vitro, it might be possible that some flagellar associated proteins are expressed as was observed in phytophthora grown under conditions that do not produce zoospores  <cit> . some of the flagellar associated proteins from chlamydomonas reinhardtii  that we identified in our ests are predicted to be commonly expressed in other structures/tissues than zoospores . as shown by randall et al <cit> , we also found evidence of expression of dynein related to the flagellar apparatus  but we also identified several flagellar basal body proteins  that were expressed.

random candidate markers for population genetic studies can also be derived from simple sequence repeats . within the hybrid assembly, a total of  <dig> ssrs were identified within  <dig> sequences. among the ssrs, monucleotides  were the most abundant followed by dinucleotides , trinucleotides , pentanucleotides , tetranucleotides , and hexanucleotides  . lee and moorman  <cit>  developed ssr markers for pythium aphanidermatum, p. cryptoirregulare and p. irregulare from an ssr enriched library. primers p18cca1- <dig>  p18ttc1- <dig>  p18cat1- <dig> amplified ssrs in p. ultimum but were not found in this est library. it is possible that the genes in which these ssrs were located were not expressed, that these ssrs were in non-coding regions, or that the primers designed from other species worked on p. ultimum even if they had mismatches.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we report the integration of data from sanger-based chain termination and  <dig> flx pyrosequencing technologies. the two technologies were highly complementary although the shorter read length in the pyrosequencing-derived ests is problematic in that they limit biological interpretations due to the reduced information content in the predicted protein sequence. thus, while the pyrosequencing did provide depth of coverage, we were able to generate a more robust set of transcribed sequences for pythium by co-assembly of sanger and pyrosequencing derived ests. furthermore, even with a greater depth of ests provided through the  <dig> flx platform, the two sequencing methodologies generated sequences unique to each platform. the results presented contain an ample number of candidate polymorphic markers providing resources for potential phylogenetic and diagnostic and strain marker development for this agriculturally important group of plant pathogens. we expect that a similar analysis using other species and integration of data from  <dig> flx pyrosequencing technologies would work synergistically with existing or new est data and identify new genes/transcripts at a very cost effective and efficient manner.
