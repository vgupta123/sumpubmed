BACKGROUND
structural genomics/proteomics projects seek to establish high-throughput techniques by promoting routine protein structure determination either by x-ray crystallography or nmr spectroscopy  <cit> . however, the determination of large protein structures remains as a major hurdle, especially for nmr, which requires elaborate techniques and time consuming analyses  <cit> . even when x-ray crystallography is employed, the average size of proteins determined by this method and listed in the pdb  is about  <dig> residues. this situation not only reflects the difficulty of determining large protein structures, but also that of expressing and purifying them. meanwhile, most large proteins are assembled from structural domains, which are structurally independent units that are able to fold into a native structure even when isolated from the rest of the protein. thus, dissecting large proteins into their structural domains can provide several candidates for swift structural analysis by either x-ray crystallography or nmr spectroscopy.

protein dissection is often a long and tedious process. limited proteolysis is the prevalent experimental method for determining structural domain boundaries  <cit> , but it does not alleviate the problems related to the expression and purification of large proteins. screening methods for detecting natively folded proteins without relying on a specific functional activity have recently been developed  <cit> , and they may serve as tools to isolate natively folded domains from a library of randomly generated protein fragments, thus alleviating the need to first purify the full length protein. however, experimental methods are usually time-consuming, and less expensive computer-aided methods for detecting putative domains in protein sequences have practical values for all types of high-throughput proteomics projects  <cit> .

various theoretical methods for identifying domains in protein sequences have recently been reported. these include well-established sequence similarity searches against existing domain databases, such as pfam or smart  <cit> . a major limitation of these methods is their inherent inability to identify completely novel domains. on the other hand, methods that do not rely on a pre-existing domain database can be valuable tools in high-throughput structural genomics projects as they can identify novel, natively folded domains suitable for structural analysis <cit> . thus, the prediction of domain organization based on sequence information alone is presently an actively investigated topic  <cit> .

recently, domain prediction methods based on sequence information alone, such as the statistics of residue contact in domains  <cit> , the statistics of domain size distribution  <cit> , the sequence characteristics of domain linkers  <cit> , the amino acid composition of domain linkers  <cit> , covariance analysis  <cit> and the conservation of hydrophobic clusters  <cit>  have been developed. some of the aforementioned methods to detect domain boundary sequence characteristics use neural networks  <cit> . neural networks  <cit>  have been successfully applied to the prediction of several aspects of protein structure, such as secondary structures  <cit> , β turns <cit> , structural classes <cit> , and stabilization centers <cit> , but its use in domain boundary recognition is relatively new  <cit> .

in this paper, we used our neural network  <cit>  to search for putative domain linker regions in the swissprot database  <cit> . the aim of the present study was threefold. first, we asked if our neural network – which was trained with a small data set of  <dig> multi-domain proteins derived from scop  <cit>  – could be applied to a practical problem, specifically, that of detecting protein domains for structural genomics/proteomics projects from a large sequence dataset. second, we were interested in comparing our predictions, which rely only on sequence characteristics, with traditional methods that detect domains by sequence similarity to domain databases; here, we used the protein data bank   <cit>  and the conserved domain database   <cit> . last, we examined the possibility of improving the detection of domain boundaries by combining the detection of the putative domain linkers with that of the low-complexity regions, which encode unstructured protein sequence segments. overall, the present analysis confirmed our previous study, and indicated that our neural network can efficiently detect domain boundaries even when applied to a large and "real" sequence database.

RESULTS
detection of putative domain linkers by the neural network
in many applications, including ours, it is critical to reduce the number of false positives because of their experimental costs, while false negatives are not as detrimental. in our neural network, a 'cutoff' parameter determines the balance between specificity and sensitivity   <cit> . thus, we searched for putative domain linkers in  <dig> swissprot sequences using high cutoff values, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , to minimize false predictions even at the cost of missing existing linkers. the number of putative domain linkers identified by our neural network ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> for cutoffs of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. as expected, the use of a higher cutoff parameter increased the number of correct predictions, but decreased the total number of predicted domain linkers . overall, the same conclusions are reached independently from the cutoff value, when it is between  <dig>  and  <dig> . the following discussion is based on a search with a cutoff value of  <dig> , which yielded  <dig> putative domain linkers, representing  <dig> % of the data set on a residue number basis . these figures correspond to approximately one putative linker predicted for every  <dig> sequences, which is a tractable number for a high-throughput experiment.

assignment of 'putative structural domains'
for the purposes of this discussion, we define 'putative structural domains' as sequence segments with high similarity to pdb or cdd sequences . putative structural domains are thus able to fold into a native structure or at least to form a domain, and we used them to assess the correctness of the predicted domain boundaries. as anticipated, a substantial fraction of the swissprot sequences is covered by known putative structural domains. specifically, from a total of  <dig> swissprot sequences,  <dig> sequences  had similarity to a pdb sequence, and  <dig> sequences  had similarity to a cdd sequence .

correlation between predicted linkers and putative structural domain termini
our method for evaluating the correctness of the predicted domain linkers was to assess their positions relative to those of putative structural domains. to this end, we classified the putative domain linkers into four classes . linkers that matched either one or both ends of a putative structural domain were classified into classes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and were considered as correctly predicted. putative domain linkers overlapping with putative structural domains are likely to break them in two non-foldable sequences. they were thus counted as incorrect predictions, and classified in class  <dig>  finally, putative linkers that were located far away from any putative structural domains  were categorized in class  <dig>  these linkers could not be evaluated as either correct or incorrect.

the putative structural domains as defined above may contain multiple structural domains, and, hence, some linkers in class  <dig> may be correctly located. our calculations thus slightly underestimate the actual performances of both the neural network and the lcrs predictions . however, the underestimations are likely to be very small, and concern only a few percents of the putative linkers, as most proteins in the pdb  are single structural domain proteins  <cit> .

the above classification was performed by allowing an error window between the position of the predicted linker and the termini of the putative structural domain. as expected, when the error window was increased, the occurrence of correct matches increased while that of the overlaps decreased. with an error window of  <dig> residues, the percentages of correct matches , overlaps  and unknown locations  were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . thus, 75% of the putative domain linkers with predictions that could be evaluated  were correctly located, suggesting that the boundaries of the putative structural domains can be predicted with reasonable confidence. on the other hand, almost two-thirds of the putative domain linkers were predicted in regions without a corresponding putative structural domain nearby, possibly delimiting novel structural domains not yet classified in the pdb or cdd .

detection of low-complexity regions
most large-scale sequence databases contain a substantial number of long, unstructured, disordered regions that may interfere with systematic searches for structural domains. thus, the detection of unstructured portions of proteins as defined by low complexity regions , which are unlikely to fold into a globular structure  <cit> , or structurally disordered regions  <cit>  may help predict domain boundaries, although this was not the original intent. here, we examined whether lcrs as detected by seg  <cit> , overlapped with domain boundaries. two parameters in the seg program, called trigger and extension complexity, control the balance between the detection number  and the ratio of correct matches relative to incorrect ones . in order to analyze approximately the same number of sequences as that of the putative linkers detected with the cutoff of  <dig> , we set the trigger complexity to  <dig>  and the extension complexity to  <dig> , which yielded  <dig> low-complexity regions . using an error window of  <dig> residues, the percentages of correct matches , overlaps  and unknown locations  were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . thus, the position of the lcrs correlate with the temini of the putative structural domains at a level similar to that observed for the domain linkers .

comparison of domain boundaries detected by domain linkers and lcrs
although both the domain linker and lcr predictions correlate well with the putative structural domain termini, it is important to note that the lcrs and linkers are located in different sequence regions. indeed, only  <dig> out of  <dig> lcrs overlapped with the putative domain linkers predicted by our neural network, and, in turn,  <dig> out of  <dig> putative linkers were detected by the seg program . furthermore, the sequence entropy of the putative linkers was higher than that of the lcrs, with the maximum of the sequence entropy distribution at around  <dig>  for the linkers, while it was only  <dig>  for the lcrs . thus, our neural network appears to detect preferentially non-globular regions with higher sequence complexity than those detected by seg. these results indicate that lcrs and linker sequences have different characteristics, and that the two methods are complementary for identifying domain boundaries .

as a result of their complementarity, the sensitivity of the domain detection was clearly improved by combining the lcr and linker predictions . a combined search yielded  <dig> domain boundaries, i.e., only  <dig> sequences less than the total of the lcr and linker sequences. furthermore, the domain boundary sequences identified by a combined lcr-linker search were categorized into the  <dig> classes in percentages similar to those identified by the separate lcr and linker searches. thus, the total number of correctly predicted domain termini increased  <dig>  fold, while the fraction of incorrect predictions  remained unchanged.

comparison with random guesses
as a further assessment of both our neural network and the seg program to detect putative structural domain termini, we estimated the success rate of a blind prediction. the blind prediction was defined as the probability that a randomly assigned residue in the query sequence matches with a putative structural domain terminal residue within the allowed error . we compared the random guesses with our neural network and seg prediction using a quality index calculated as the ratio of correct predictions relative to the sum of correct and incorrect predictions  <cit> , which is computed as the number of sequences in classes  <dig> and  <dig> divided by those in classes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  figure  <dig> clearly shows that the quality index of the blind prediction is far below those of the two other methods. this result strongly supports our initial assumption that the occurrences of both the putative domain linkers and the low-complexity regions near the putative structural domain terminal regions are not fortuitous.

domain termini and error windows
from a practical viewpoint, it is important to evaluate the error window within which the boundaries are predicted. the exact position of a domain boundary is obviously ambiguous. the first reason is that pdb sequences may include several unstructured terminal residues , causing some uncertainties about the exact positions of the putative structural domain termini. the uncertainty arising from the cdd sequence is even larger. second, the smoothing windows used to reduce the spurious predictions introduce ambiguity in the positions of the predicted domain linkers, as they smear their c and n termini. these issues can be examined using an error window parameter that accommodates the positional ambiguity generated by both the putative structural domain termini and the predicted domain linkers . as shown in figure  <dig>  the positions of the first and last residues of the predicted domain linker are distributed randomly around the positions of the last and respectively first residue of the structural termini. this shows that the error distribution is random with a maximum at  <dig> residue, confirming that the linker positions are accurately assigned. the error is clearly limited to about  <dig> residues, and to  <dig> residues in most cases. furthermore, the prediction quality index dependence on the error window also indicates that the ambiguity is limited to about  <dig> residues, as it reaches 70% for a  <dig> residue error window and then rapidly levels off for larger windows .

CONCLUSIONS
our study strongly suggests that sequence characteristics alone, as detected by either our neural network or seg, can identify domain boundaries in protein sequences even without sequence similarity to existing domain databases. there is a clear correlation between the termini of putative structural domains and the positions of both the domain linkers and the lcrs. furthermore, our neural network and seg are complementary for detecting domain boundaries, and when combined, the sensitivity of the domain boundary prediction is increased without decreasing its specificity. overall, our study shows that domain identification protocol based on domain boundary prediction can be applied to practical problems, such as the identification of novel structural domains, and thus will yield new targets for large scale protein analyses.
