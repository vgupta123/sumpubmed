BACKGROUND
wheat  has an allohexaploid genome structure that arose from two polyploidization events. the first brought together the genomes of two diploid species related to the wild species triticum urartu  and a species related to aegilops speltoides   <cit> . this hybridization formed the allotetraploid triticum turgidum  that suffered the second hybridization event with a diploid grass species, aegilops tauschii , producing the ancestral allohexaploid t. aestivum   <cit> . thus, the hexaploid wheat genome is characterized by its large size  and complexity, with repetitive sequences accounting for ~ 80% of the genome  <cit> .

the number and complexity of repetitive elements varies between species, and those with larger genomes generally have more repetitive elements  <cit> . repetitive sequences can be divided into three main classes: transposable elements, tandem repeats, and high copy number genes, such as ribosomal or histone genes. transposable elements  are the best-defined class and constitute the most abundant component of many genomes, ranging from 10% to 85%  <cit> . based on transposition mechanism, tes can be subdivided into two classes. class i, retrotransposons, move via so-called “copy and paste” mechanisms using rna intermediates, and is mainly composed of long terminal repeat  retrotransposons and non-ltr retrotransposons, such as lines and sines   <cit> . class ii dna transposons replicate without an rna intermediate, either by a cut-and-paste mechanism , by rolling-circle dna replication , or by mechanisms that remain unknown  <cit> .

tandem repeats represent a second class of repetitive sequences that can account for a large portion of genomic dna, comprising any sequence found in consecutive copies along a dna strand, arranged in tandem arrays of the monomeric unit  <cit> . typically localized to specialized chromosome regions such as centromeres, telomeres, and heterochromatic knobs of many eukaryotes  <cit> , tandem repeats can be categorized according to the size of the repeated units. microsatellites or simple sequence repeats consist of 1– <dig> nucleotides, minisatellites are 10– <dig> nucleotides, and satellites include more than  <dig> nucleotides. satellites are the main class of tandem repeats and are thought to play a role in organizing and stabilizing the specialized chromosome regions in which they are found, which are important for chromosome behavior during cell division  <cit> . whereas some satellite repeats are chromosome-specific, others are more broadly distributed  <cit> .

repetitive sequences have a large influence on genome structure, function and evolution but, at the same time, complicate genomic analysis. these highly variable genome components, especially tes, are subject of dynamic evolution mainly due to insertions, illegitimate and unequal recombination, and interchromosomal and tandem duplications  <cit> . in bread  wheat, polyploidization and the prevalence of tes has resulted in massive gene duplication and movement. from a practical point of view, repetitive sequences constitute a potential source of a wide range of markers useful for genome diversity and evolution analysis, genetic mapping and marker-assisted selection. among them we can find markers based on short tandem repeats, such as sequence tagged microsatellite sites   <cit>  and simple sequence repeats  , or markers based on transposable elements like: sequence-specific amplification polymorphism   <cit> , retrotransposon based insertion polymorphism   <cit> , interretrotransposon amplified polymorphism  and retrotransposon-microsatellite amplified polymorphism   <cit> , repeat junction– junction marker   <cit> , insertion-site-based polymorphism   <cit> , and repeat junction marker   <cit> .

the complete characterization of tes, as well as the elucidation of their distribution across genomes and the mechanisms responsible for that distribution, constitutes essential information for understanding the nature and consequences of genome size variations between different species, as well as the large-scale organization and evolution of plant genomes. however, this type of analysis is hindered by the large genome and the polyploid nature of bread wheat. the international wheat genome sequencing consortium .

RESULTS
quantification of repetitive sequences from wheat homeologous group  <dig> chromosome arms
the repetitive elements were assessed through homology-based comparison with the mips repeat element database using the assemblies obtained from roche  <dig> survey sequences of chromosome arms of wheat chromosome 4d  and illumina sequences of all chromosome arms of wheat chromosome group  <dig>  computational identification, classification and masking of repetitive elements, including low complexity regions using the rm software yielded  <dig> % and  <dig> % for 4ds <dig> and 4dl <dig> and  <dig> % and  <dig> % for 4dsi and 4dli masked bases, respectively . on the other hand, 4asi, 4ali, 4bsi and 4bli were composed of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of repetitive sequences, respectively . similarly, repetitive dna contents of the diploid a and d genome contributors of hexaploid wheat, t. urartu and ae. tauschii, were reported to be 67%  <cit>  and 66%  <cit> , respectively.table  <dig>

the chromosome arms are expressed by a number that indicates the homeologous group followed by a letter that indicates the genome  and the chromosome arm . the subscripts refer to the technology used for sequencing . for each element class the number of elements , the length of the sequence occupied by these elements  and the percentage of the sequence that is covered by repetitive elements  are given.



comparisons among the percentage of the repeat fraction of chromosome arms reported using roche  <dig> sequencing technology  <cit>  and the ones obtained through illumina  <cit> , suggest that the first ones constitute a better representation on the real status . this assumption is further supported by previous estimations of 75-90% repetitive sequence content of bread wheat genome  <cit> . it has been reported that the longer roche  <dig> reads as compared to the illumina reads, results in an improvement in mapping of repetitive regions  <cit> . in addition to the sequencing platform, it is necessary to take into account that the estimation of repetitive dna content depends on the method used. using mathematically defined repeats   <cit>  it was estimated that the assembly of all chromosome survey sequences of wheat contains  <dig> % of mdrs - 20mers with abundance over  <dig> copies  <cit> . the difference observed could be caused by the limited representation in the databases used for masking.table  <dig>

the repetitive regions of 4ds <dig> and 4dl <dig> were almost homogeneously distributed along both chromosome arms  <cit>  what, likely, may be due to limitations of repetitive sequences assembly, used genetic map and genomezipper which are positively biased toward the gene-containing regions  <cit> .

classification of repetitive sequences from wheat homeologous group  <dig> chromosome arms
the rm software was further used to classify recognizable repeat families. rna retrotransposons were the most highly represented sequence repeats, accounting for ~50% of all chromosome arms except for 4dli, in which it was estimated to be 33% of the total sequenced length . however, retroelements represented between 74% to 92% of the total repeat fraction in the eight datasets of the homeologous group  <dig> chromosome arms. the retroelements were followed in abundance by dna elements, which comprised between 7% to 23% of total repeats. thus, the dna and rna transposons represented more than 96% of the repeat fraction for all the chromosome arms. dna transposons and retrotransposons were further subclassified, according to the wicker’s criteria  <cit> , revealing that for 4d chromosome arms, cacta/en-spm dna-transposons and gypsy retrotransposons were the most abundant superfamilies .figure  <dig> distribution of dna and rna transposon superfamilies on 4d chromosome arms. bars represent the percentage of each superfamily with respect to the total dna or rna transposable elements, for 4dl  and 4ds . classification was performed as suggested in  <cit> .



the analysis and characterization of satellites, simple repeats and low complexity regions were performed along the wheat homeologous group  <dig> chromosome arms sequences included in this study . small rna, satellites, simple repeats and low complexity sequences represented only small proportions of assemblies of all chromosome arms . this finding is not surprising, because these loci derive from repetitive at and gc-rich sequences that may be collapsed or represented by uneven read coverage in illumina sequences  <cit> . this assumption is corroborated by the finding that the gaa microsatellite is not observed within the most abundant microsatellites detected , although its presence has been previously evidenced by using fish, where the gaa designed probe creates large blocks of signal on all chromosomes  <cit> . on the other hand several of the trinucleotide ssrs identified as the most abundant in the survey sequences provide on fish weak disperse signals . the presence of ssrs was analyzed in order to search for new putative markers for physical and genetic mapping. the frequency of ssrs ranged from one ssr per  <dig> to 27 kb for 4asi, 4ali, 4bsi, 4bli, 4dsi, 4ds <dig> and 4dl <dig> chromosome arms. for 4dli assemblies, the frequency was notably higher reaching one ssr per  <dig>  kb. variable ssr frequency has been reported among other chromosomes or chromosome arms. for example, the frequency reported for 5bs and 5bl was one ssr per  <dig> and 23 kb, respectively, whereas 3b and 3as chromosomes have a ssr frequency of one ssr per  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively  <cit> . the ssr frequencies are higher in transcribed regions than in non-coding regions, being the ssr frequency inversely related to the proportion of repetitive dna  <cit> . thus, the lower repeat content of 4dli respect either to 4dl <dig> or to the other chromosome arms from the homeologous group  <dig> agrees with the higher frequency of ssr. this is also in agreement with the gene content calculated for chromosome 4d  <cit> . the analysis of ssr motifs according to the size of repeat units revealed that dinucleotides and trinucleotides were the most abundant ssrs . in comparison, the trinucleotide constitutes the most frequent ssr motif in brachypodium, rice and maize whereas papaya shows a higher frequency of dinucleotide motifs and soybean a higher frequency of tetranucleotide motifs  <cit> . microsatellites were further divided into three classes, at-rich , at/gc-balanced  and gc-rich motifs. the analysis revealed the predominance of at/gc balanced motifs on the chromosome arms 4asi, 4ali, 4bsi, 4bli and 4ds <dig> whereas the most abundant on 4dl <dig>  4dsi and 4dli were the gc-rich motifs . the combination of both analysis, i.e., the size and nucleotide composition of the repeat unit, revealed that more than the 80% of the dinucleotides belongs to the at/gc-balanced class, mainly n/n, which is also the most abundant dinucleotide motif in brachypodium and arabidopsis while in papaya and soybean the most abundant dinucleotide is at/ta  <cit> . except for 4dl <dig>  the gc-rich are the prevalent trinucleotide motif in all chromosome arms as it was described for brachypodium and rice whereas in maize, wheat, papaya, arabidopsis and soybean at-rich trinucleotide repeats were the majority  <cit> . interestingly, trinucleotides motifs represent ~50% of the 4dli ssrs mainly composed of ccg/cgg motifs . finally, the at-rich tetranucleotide ssrs prevail in the majority of the group  <dig> homeologous chromosome arm survey sequences. these vast data were used to identify ssr motifs specific for the tested chromosome arms or whole chromosomes and we tested this information by their physical localization on metaphase chromosomes. identification of ssrs with chromosome distinct pattern may have practical implications.figure  <dig> ssr classification according to the size of repeat units. the graph illustrates the frequency of the different sizes of the ssrs repeat units classified as dinucleotides, trinucleotides, tetranucleotides, pentanucleotides and hexanucleotides across the homeologous group  <dig> chromosome arms from t. aestivum obtained through illumina  and  <dig>  sequencing technologies.

microsatellites were classified into three classes, at-rich: greater than 50% a or t in the motif; gc-rich: greater than 50% g or c in the motif; at/gc-balanced: equal amount of gc and at, along the six chromosome arms obtained through illumina and the two obtained through  <dig> sequencing technologies.



the ssr markers still have potential for whole genome or sub-genome mapping  <cit>  and breeding  <cit> . additionally, some of the ssrs were found very useful as physical markers for cytogenetic mapping, metaphase chromosome identification  <cit>  and enhancing chromosome sorting by fishis  <cit> . since most of the di and tri-nucleotide ssrs were already localized  <cit>  we focused on ssrs with longer subunit. the comparison of sequence occurrence of unique ssr motifs among chromosomes and chromosome arms allowed identification of ssrs suggestive to be putative arm-specific . the n/n and n/n motifs showed specificity for 4dl and n/n showed specificity for 4bl. additionally, n/n was found specific for chromosome 4d. fish localization on metaphase chromosomes showed that microsatellites produced weak dispersed signals on almost all chromosomes . these findings suggest that quantitative assessment of ssrs in the survey sequence assembly may not be representative due to, already above discussed, the possibility of collapsing of highly repetitive tandem repeats in assemblies of short sequencing reads, but catalog of available microsatellites and other repeats can provide useful information for marker candidate sequence identification and marker development.

identification and annotation of novel ltr retrotransposons
ltr retrotransposons account for a significant fraction of many genomes and even are the predominant component of some large genomes  <cit> . typical structural characteristics include: 1) two highly similar ltr sequences; 2) target site duplications; 3) a primer binding site and a polypurine tract; 4) protein-coding domains for enzymes important to retrotransposition  <cit> . additionally, non-autonomous ltr retrotransposons have been described in plants as large retrotransposon derivatives  and terminal repeat retrotransposons in miniature , both of which have the typical features of ltr retrotransposons but lack protein-coding capability in their internal domain  <cit> .

the whole 4ds and 4dl scaffolds were further scanned for ltr retrotransposons using the bioinformatics tools ltr_finder  <cit>  and ltr_struc  <cit> . the mentioned subset of data was chosen for novel ltr identification due to the larger size when compared to the illumina contigs, as revealed by size frequency histograms . the ltr_finder and ltr_struc outputs lead to  <dig> candidate sequences , that were clustered using the cd-hit interface  <cit> , resulting in  <dig> unique ltr retrotransposon candidates. after manually search for previously defined elements against mips database following the criteria of  <cit> ,  <dig> putative retrotransposons were excluded . the remaining  <dig> candidate elements were analyzed for the presence of ltr retrotransposon features using blastx searches at ncbi and gydb  <cit> , reducing the number of candidates for newly identified retrotransposons to six . the blastx analysis also revealed that likely complete transposon-related proteins were present in four out of the six candidates , as judged by the coverage of the alignments with reported proteins, whereas the other two, jrol <dig> and jrol <dig>  showed small protein fragments and thus non-coding capacity. the fact that two out of four retrotransposon protein coding regions lack stop codons whereas the other two showed only one indicate that such candidates could encode functional protein sequences. notice that the presence of few stop codons may not directly imply the absence of functionality of a te family since only recently inserted elements have not been subject to mutations and could be taken as functional. the identity and coverage of the alignments demonstrate that the novel ltr retrotransposons are members of known superfamilies but constitute novel ltr retrotransposon families . their classification was carried out following the current proposed system  <cit> , revealing that three of the newly identified ltr retrotransposons belonged to the copia superfamily, one was gypsy and the other two were non autonomous terminal repeat retrotransposons in miniature  and thus designations were assigned to the six new families . the insertion time of the six newly identified ltr retrotransposons was estimated based on the assumption that the sequences of the two ltrs were identical at the time of integration and accumulated point mutations independently with time. thus, the nucleotide substitution rate between the two ltrs, considered to reflect the time elapsed since the insertion event, was estimated to be in the range of  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig>  106 years .figure  <dig> annotation of novel ltr retrotransposons. a) the scheme depicts the steps followed for the identification of novel tes, starting from the assembled 4ds and 4dl scaffolds, according to the criteria proposed by wicker et al.  <cit> . b) graphic representation of the structural features identified in each ltr retrotransposon drawn to scale. gag: capsid proteins; ap: aspartic proteinase; int: integrase; rt: reverse transcriptase; rh: rnase h. chrd: chromodomain.

identification of members of the novel ltr retrotransposon families
the presence of full-length copies of the novel ltr retrotransposon in genome was tested, using the candidate ltr retrotransposons as probes against the t. aestivum chromosome arm assemblies acquired from the iwgsc database, following the criteria proposed by  <cit> . there were identified  <dig> to  <dig> copies for each candidate, being rlc_facunda_jrol01000922- <dig> the most abundant one .

however, such values are probably miscalculated due to the short length of the sequences deposited in the databases; thus, a single unique large ltr retrotransposon could give rise to several hits. to address this, we adopted an additional approach consisting of blastn searches against the t. aestivum  and ae. tauschii  whole genome shotgun sequence  databases using the six candidate ltr retrotransposons as probes. the resulting sequences were used as input for the ltr_finder and ltr_struc programs and the output sequences were extracted from the wgs and manually analyzed to verify the identity with the probed ltr retrotransposon. such procedure allowed identification of one member of the ltr retrotransposon family for candidates rlc_genoveva_jrol01007197- <dig> and rlx_gabrielle_jrol01007833- <dig>  two for rlc_facunda_jrol01000922- <dig> and rlg_francisca_jrol01008273- <dig> and three for rlc_carmen_jrol01007734- <dig> . interestingly, thirty one new ltr retrotransposons were identified when probed with rlx_victoria_jrol01006440- <dig> .

finally, all the positive hits obtained through blastn search of t. aestivum and ae. tauschii wgs probed with the six candidate ltr retrotransposons were additionally blast searched against a local database, constructed by adding to the mips database the six novel ltr retrotransposons. the alignments among the wgs and the local database were manually analyzed. to be considered a candidate ltr retrotransposon copy the wgs needed to: i) show identity to the candidate exclusively or, b) exhibit remarkably higher identity to the probed ltr retrotransposon than to any other ltr retrotransposon. sequences that fulfilled these parameters were extracted from wgs. this approach showed that at least one strong-hit copy was present in the wgs database for each of the six candidates, together with several partial copies .

to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship among the members of each family, the six ltr candidates identified in the 4ds and 4dl scaffolds were individually aligned with the members of the respective families identified in wgs by the use of ltr_finder and ltr_struc and included some of the ltrs identified though blastn. for each candidate, the alignments included as outlayers ltrs that, in spite of being members of other families, were close to the new ltr candidates. the phylogenetic trees confirmed the existence of six new ltr retrotransposon families . for rlc_carmen_jrol01007734- <dig> and rlc_facunda_jrol01000922- <dig> there were included in the alignments the longer retrotransposons identified.figure  <dig> molecular phylogenetic analysis. evolutionary relationships among members of the six novel ltr families. aegilops tauschii and triticum aestivum whole genome shotgun sequences deposited at ncbi were searched using the six novel ltrs identified in wheat 4d chromosome as probes. phylogenetic analyses were conducted in mega <dig>  <cit> . the number of positions that resulted parsimony informative out of the total positions in the final dataset, were a) 1015/ <dig> , b) 80/ <dig> , c) 331/ <dig> , d) 104/ <dig> , e) 1401/ <dig> , f) 313/ <dig> .



special attention was centered in the ltr family rlx_victoria_jrol01006440- <dig> since most members were identified by ltr_finder and/or ltr_struc and thus several structural information about them is available. most of the members of the family ranged in size from  <dig> to 3250 bp and carried ltrs of  <dig> to 1051 bp, whereas one member was 8698 bp in length. detailed insight in such member revealed that it was not a single retrotransposon but four victoria ltr retrotransposons in tandem. complete elements were flanked by  <dig> to 6-bp target site duplications. blastx alignment of the members of the family with retrotransposon proteins across the gydb and ncbi databases revealed the presence of short fragments of some proteins, such as ap and int. since no complete orf could be identified, it could be deduced that the internal domains of the elements lack coding capability. regarding the internal region, the primer binding site was complementary to the methionine trna in 50% of the sequences, whereas 32% corresponded to other trnas and it could not be identified for 18% of the trnas. a 15-nt polypurine tract was identified upstream of the 3′ltr. as demonstrated through blastx searches in the ncbi and gydb databases, none of the identified members of the family possess the complete orfs necessary to be considered an autonomous te. thus, taking into account the size of the members, the family was classified as trim non-autonomous ltr retrotransposons. the six novel retrotransposon families will be included in the next update of the plant genome and systems biology repeat element database .

the transposon insertion site based markers are specific and highly abundant, especially in large genomes where repetitive sequences represent major portions of genomic sequence, and became popular in plant genetic, physical mapping and diversity assessments. several approaches were developed to visualize polymorphisms in the insertion sites and the most widely used in wheat are the rjm  <cit>  or isbp markers  <cit> . in light of this, identification and characterization of any new transposon adds to the pool of possible markers. after identification of six new ltr retrotransposons  their dna was amplified and labeled with fluorescent dye. the resulting probes were hybridized on metaphase chromosomes. most of the probes  provided weak and mostly randomly distributed unreliable signals on several chromosomes . an exception was probe from ltr retrotransposon carmen which provided signal in centromeric region of all chromosomes  with highly varying intensity. unfortunately, fish analysis could not provide quantitative data which limits assessment of abundance of the retrotransposon for centromeres of particular chromosomes. surprisingly, chromosome 4d showed very weak signal for this probe in all metaphase figures analyzed . these findings support previously identified facts that repetitive elements and particularly transposons can, besides their selfish multiplication, play also an important role in evolution of genomes in moderating gene expression and creating new genes by exon reshuffling  <cit>  or are part of important genome structures as centromeres and have ability to specifically target such structures  <cit> .figure  <dig> physical localization of newly identified transposons. the identified retrotransposons were localized on metaphase spreads of vc. chinese spring using in situ hybridization with fluorescent labeled probes. red color was used for the repetitive probes, green color was used for afa probe and blue was stained chromosome dna using dapi. arrows are pointing at 4d chromosome. a) probes of all retrotransposons besides retrotransposon carmen produced weak disperse signals on all chromosomes. the red signals represent distribution of retrotransposon victoria. b) the red channel of figure a to demonstrate distribution of weak signals of victoria probe on whole chromosomes. c) all probes derived from retrotransposon carmen gave similar hybridisation pattern on metaphase chromosomes. surprisingly, the retrotransposon was preferentially localized in centromeric region of all chromosomes with varying intensity. on few chromosomes were observed weak and dispersed signals on distal parts of chromosome arms too. d) the red channel of figure c to demonstrate distribution of weak signals of carmen probe on whole chromosomes. scale bars represent 10 μm.



CONCLUSIONS
the present work constitutes the first insight of wheat homeologous group  <dig> chromosomes repetitive sequences analyzed at the chromosome arm level. detailed study of repetitive elements becomes more interesting as it has been thought before, since repetitive elements seems to play important roles in genome structure and size variation and also contribute to the evolution of genes and their function. in accordance with results obtained for other grasses, cacta/en-spm and gypsy were the most abundant dna transposons and retrotransposons, respectively, suggestive of their conserved roles in genome regulation. the characterization of the tandem repeat content along the homeologous group  <dig> allowed creating a list of ssr motifs in wheat chromosomes of the homeologous group  <dig>  six novel ltr retrotransposon families were characterized, including three copias, one gypsy, and two trim ltr retrotransposons. in spite of the extensive research performed in triticeae genomes and the high number of reported elements, the fact that six new elements could be identified indicates that new families probably remain to be described. however, for more detailed study of quantitative repeatome content and structure a reference sequence is crucial.
