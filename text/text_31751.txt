BACKGROUND
the human sub-chromosomal region xq <dig> has been a focus of genome research for the last  <dig> years, because many diseases have been linked to this region. systematic mapping and transcript identification at this region was performed in the early and mid nineties  <cit> , while the subsequent availability of the human and mouse genome sequences enabled further gene predictions  <cit> . while gene density along the x chromosome as a whole is below genome average, that of the sub-chromosomal region xq <dig> is far above the average . covering approximately 5% of the chromosome, xq <dig> harbours almost 13% of the x chromosomal genes. the region spans  <dig>  megabases of genomic dna  <cit>  and harbours  <dig> non-redundant, confirmed protein-coding genes . to date, more than  <dig> diseases have been mapped to xq <dig>  for  <dig> of these, the causative genes have been identified. among them x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy , x-linked myotubular myopathy , x-linked dyskeratosis congenita , and rett syndrome . however, for  <dig> of the xq28-mapped diseases, the causative gene is still unknown. ten of them are associated with mental retardation, either as one clinical feature, which is part of a syndrome , or as the only primary symptom among affected individuals . most of these  <dig> diseases are rare, limiting fine mapping approaches due to the low patient numbers available for linkage studies. in addition, diagnosis is often imprecise, because of variable phenotypes. divergence in phenotypes can be caused for instance by environmental factors, the different genetic background of patients, or different mutations within the same gene. the size of the mapped regions of these  <dig> diseases varies between  <dig>  and  <dig>  megabases  and renders mutational screens for disease association laborious and difficult. for example, the mapped region for the waisman syndrome  <cit>  harbours more than  <dig> genes. to expedite disease gene identification, we took the next step in systematic xq <dig> analysis and initiated a functional description of all xq <dig> genes. as the tissue expression pattern of a gene particularly at the cell type level, as well as the intracellular localisation of the encoded protein provides highly relevant information regarding function, we systematically studied the xq <dig> genes by rna in situ hybridisation, northern blotting, subcellular localisation, and data mining. using this functional information, we aimed to narrow down the number of putative disease genes to a manageable set of promising candidates for mutational screens. we organised all experimental data in a relational database enabling comprehensive query options. using this database with the presumption that all diseases base on single gene mutations, we compared expression patterns of genes with disease phenotypes. this led to the identification of prioritised candidate disease genes for  <dig> of the  <dig> xq28-mapped diseases that do not have a gene associated yet.

RESULTS
rna in situ hybridisation
we studied the expression of the respective orthologous mouse genes by rna in situ hybridisation and northern blot analysis or rt-pcr as the first step of our systematic functional analysis. fifteen mage-a or gabre family members were excluded from the total of  <dig> confirmed human protein-coding xq <dig> genes. the human mage-a genes are silent in normal tissues, except for male germ cells. and also the mouse orthologs have been described to be not expressed in normal adult tissues, again with the exception of male germ cells  <cit> . for the remaining  <dig> genes,  <dig> mouse orthologs could be identified, all these genes mapping in the synthenic region on the murine x chromosome. for six of the orthologs, the expression patterns have already been published  <cit> . in this work, we analysed tissue expression patterns for the remaining  <dig> mouse orthologs first by northern blot or rt-pcr followed by rna in situ hybridisation. tissue sections of four embryonic stages and ten adult tissues were used to study expression at the cell type level. by combining results from three independent methods, we attained a comprehensive overall picture on the tissue expression profiles of the genes under investigation. we obtained an expression pattern for  <dig>  of the analysed genes by rna in situ hybridisation and/or northern blotting/rt-pcr. in northern blot/rt-pcr analysis,  <dig>  of the genes showed expression in all tissues analysed. different splice variants could be detected for  <dig>  of the genes. in rna in situ hybridisation,  <dig> genes showed enhanced expression in at least one of the analysed tissues. all tissue expression profiles, as well as original images are accessible through the web-interface of the database, which is described in more detail below. original images from in situ hybridisation were included in the database in all of those cases, where different expression could be observed in different cell types of a tissue, i.e. when in situ hybridisation adds more detailed information on expression compared to northern blot analysis. in situ hybridisation results that are not linked to original images showed an even expression of the respective gene in the different cell types of that tissue. for northern analysis, all original images are included in the database.

subcellular localisation
in parallel, we determined the specific subcellular localisation of the respective human proteins, as the cellular environment contributes information on the possible suite of interaction partners a protein may have and consequently on its potential function. open reading frames of  <dig> of the human xq <dig> genes were amplified and cloned into suitable fluorescent fusion protein expression vectors  <cit> . subcellular localisation was analysed by fluorescence microscopy in transiently expressing tissue culture cells. since the presence of the fluorescence tag can mask important targeting signals present at either ends of the protein, all proteins were expressed and analysed both as n-terminal and c-terminal fusion proteins. together with original images, the localisations are provided at our web-accessible database.

data integration
we created an annotation scheme for the analysis of the expression data, differentiating between  <dig> organs ,  <dig> tissues ,  <dig> sub-tissues , and  <dig> cell types . the level of expression was quantified by manual assignment into one of the classes "weak signal", "signal", "strong signal", "ubiquitous", and "enhanced". together with more than  <dig> original images and the subcellular localisation results, this information has been organised in a relational database, integrating all experimental results, in addition to web-accessible annotation data for all the genes under investigation. the data can be queried through a web-interface according to various criteria and boolean combinations , such as developmental stages, tissue types, hybridisation signal intensities, numbers of transcripts, subcellular compartment, or gene identifiers . the output matching the selection criteria is either shown in a table together with links to primary data  and to external websites  or in xml. in addition to the query interface, a map-like view scaled to chromosomal positions is available, where gene symbols are linked to experimental data, and gene positions to the corresponding regions within the ucsc genome browser. due to a highly flexible database structure, new data can be entered easily and is readily available via the web-interface  <cit> .

identification of candidate disease genes
for the identification of candidate disease genes, we queried the xq <dig> database to screen for expression patterns that fit to affected tissues in seventeen xq28-mapped diseases, for which the causative gene is still unknown. ten of these diseases are associated with mental retardation, syndromic as well as non-syndromic forms.

first we concentrated on hippocampus, cerebellum, and the olfactory bulb. a number of genes causing mental retardation, for example mecp <dig>   <cit> , ndp   <cit> , fmr <dig>   <cit> , or slc6a <dig>   have already been reported to have elevated expression in these brain regions compared to other areas of the brain . because of this high compliance we expected that also other genes involved in mental retardation might be highly expressed in these regions. for eighteen genes analysed by rna in situ hybridisation we found an enhanced expression in one or several of these regions . four genes, namely atp6ap <dig>  hcfc <dig>  idh3g, and cd99l <dig>  showed enhanced expression in all of the three brain regions.

in figure  <dig>  expression of atp6ap <dig> in adult mouse brain is shown. enhanced expression can be observed in the cells of the hippocampus, the purkinje cells in the cerebellum and the mitral cells in the olfactory bulb. results for the other three genes can be viewed at our web-accessible database.

we then extended the analysis to diseases and symptoms other than mental retardation, or diseases where mental retardation is only part of a syndrome. to select tissues for each disease that may be affected, we used the phenotypic description within the omim database  <cit> . next, we screened our database for genes that show significant expression in tissues affected by the diseases. in this screen, expression patterns of additional genes could be matched to affected tissues of the xq28-mapped diseases.

we took the mapping information of the  <dig> xq28-mapped diseases and listed those genes for each disease, whose expression pattern overlap with potential affected tissues, and which are located in or nearby the respective linkage region. we included nearby genes because linkage analysis often is imprecise. by these means, we prioritised one or several candidate genes for  <dig> of the  <dig> xq28-mapped diseases. the results are summarised in table  <dig> 

good matches of expression pattern with affected tissues in disease were obtained for rpl <dig> with goeminne/tkcr sydrome , and for stk <dig> with x-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy . rpl <dig> shows ubiquitous expression in northern blot analysis , and also in rna in situ hybridisation a signal was obtained in most of the analysed tissues. strong expression of the gene was observed in the adult brain, especially in the hippocampal formation and cells of the hypothalamus. also different cell types in the male and female reproductive system have shown a higher expression of the gene, like the leydig cells in adult testis, the pseudostratified columnar epithelium  and the cells of the simple columnar epithelium in the cervical glands. the analysis of embryonic tissues has pointed out that the gene is also higher expressed in some tissues of dpc  <dig>  embryo, like in the epithelial cells of the gut, in kidney, lung, and thymus as well as in the serous glands in the nasal cavity and the clavicle. figure 4a presents some of the results from the rna in situ hybridisation. for the serine/threonine kinase  <dig> gene stk <dig> the expression was highest in heart, spleen, muscle, and testis by northern blot analysis, whereas by rna in situ hybridisation, an enhanced signal in embryonic muscle was observed .

discussion
identification of candidate genes for diseases involving mental retardation
the hippocampus, cerebellum, and the olfactory bulb are associated with basic properties of learning and memory in all mammals  <cit> , which is in accordance with the hypothesis that these brain regions are affected tissues in mental retardation syndromes. mice with a gene knock out of l1cam develop a smaller than normal hippocampus with fewer pyramidal and granule cells  <cit> . mutations in the human ortholog cause different forms of mental retardation, like the masa syndrome/spastic paraplegia type  <dig>  and hydrocephalus . an enhanced expression in hippocampus, cerebellum, and the olfactory bulb has been shown for several genes known to cause mental retardation, namely mecp <dig>  <cit> , ndp  <cit> , fmr <dig>  <cit> , and slc6a <dig> , whereas their putative molecular functions are diverse . because of these findings, we based our search for candidate mental retardation genes on the hypothesis, that a gene causing a disease is expressed in tissues affected by this disease. so that disease association could be concluded from expression pattern rather than from a particular molecular function. interestingly, evolutionary conservation of genes causing mental retardation appears to be frequently restricted to vertebrates, as it is the case for five of the six known mental retardation genes shown in table  <dig>  eighteen genes analysed by rna in situ hybridisation showed an enhanced expression in one or several of these brain regions . five of them are known disease genes, but thirteen had not been associated with disease before. the observed expression pattern renders them primary candidates for xq28-mapped diseases involving mental retardation. moreover, for five of these  <dig> genes evolutionary conservation is restricted to vertebrates . according to their chromosomal location, each of these genes represents a candidate for a subset of xq28-mapped diseases, for which the disease regions overlap .

the mouse orthologs of the human genes atp6ap <dig>  hcfc <dig>  idh3g, and cd99l <dig>  show enhanced expression in all of the three brain regions. the putative molecular functions of these four candidate genes are diverse , as it is the case for the previously described known mental retardation genes . however, their enhanced expression in hippocampus, cerebellum and the olfactory bulb renders them strong candidates for xq28-mapped diseases involving mental retardation. moreover, for two of these four candidates , phylogenetic conservation is restricted to vertebrates, as can be observed for a number of known mental retardation genes . for cd99l <dig>  a possible association with diseases involving mental retardation could be implicated also by its putative function: its high expression in neuronal cells is conserved in mammals and zebra fish and suggests a dominant role in neural development  <cit> .

identification of candidate genes for other diseases
when searching for candidate genes for diseases other than mental retardation, or for diseases where mental retardation is only part of a syndrome, we stuck to the hypothesis, that disease association correlates with expression in tissues affected by this disease. based on the hypothesis mentioned above, we searched for expression patterns that match potentially affected tissues of xq28-mapped diseases, using omim phenotypic descriptions to list such tissues  <cit> . by these means, we could prioritise candidate genes for  <dig> of the  <dig> xq28-mapped diseases . between one and  <dig> genes with matched expression pattern could be listed for each disease, a number which is amenable to mutational screening approaches. moreover, for most of the diseases, one to four genes with best matching expression patterns could be highlighted , which could be started within mutational screens. some of the genes are candidates for more than one disease, because of an overlap of symptoms and the overlap of the candidate regions.

very good matches of expression pattern with affected tissues could be identified for rpl <dig> with goeminne/tkcr syndrome, and for stk23with x-linked myopathy/xmea.

tkcr syndrome is characterised by torticollis, keloids, cryptorchidism, reproductive system abnormalities, and renal dysplasia. for rpl <dig>  we observed an enhanced expression in brain, in different cell types of the reproductive system, and in embryonic kidney . the rpl <dig> protein is a component of the 60s ribosomal subunit and belongs to the l <dig> family of ribosomal proteins. it is required for 60s pre-ribosome assembly  <cit> , nuclear export of the 60s subunit  <cit> , and the yeast ortholog qsr1p was shown to be required for 60s/40s joining  <cit> . on the x chromosome, rpl <dig> locates very close upstream to the tkcr linkage region, but disease mapping by linkage analysis is often imprecise. due to its expression pattern, and taking imprecise linkage analysis into consideration, rpl <dig> is a good candidate for tkcr syndrome.

for stk <dig>  a prominent signal in skeletal muscle and heart was observed through all developmental stages. it is also expressed in adult lung, spleen, testis, cerebellum, and the olfactory bulb . due to the remarkable expression pattern in embryonic muscle, stk <dig> could be a candidate for x-linked myopathy/xmea. xmea is characterised by slowly progressing muscle weakness and excessive autophagy. an allelism with emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy has been excluded  <cit> . stk <dig> is a serine/threonine protein kinase also known as muscle-specific serine kinase  <dig> .

our hypothesis, that a gene causative for a disease is expressed in tissues affected by this disease, is of course limited, as the timely limited expression of a dysfunctional gene during development for example might lead to a disease, which might become manifest in the adult tissue only. an alternative route to look for disease genes, based on the molecular function of the candidates, could be followed. however, for this route, the molecular functions of the genes within the linkage regions and the molecular pathologies of the diseases have to be known. this is not the case for many xq <dig> genes and diseases. moreover, as mentioned above, for several known mental retardation genes enhanced expression has been shown in brain regions, which are associated with functions impaired in mentally retarded patients.

in this context, our study might help to select genes to start with in mutational screens, where the linkage region of the disease is large and contains a high number of genes.

data accessibility
the goal of our study was to use the functional information to prioritise candidate disease genes. for this purpose, it was necessary to organise and integrate this large and heterogeneous dataset. since our data is organised in a web-accessible database  <cit> , all information may also be used by the scientific community applying highly specified queries with individual focus. by these means, every researcher is able to use the data to prioritise candidate disease genes, both for diseases not listed in omim and for diseases that may be discovered and/or mapped to xq <dig> in the future. in the last years, a lot of different systematic expression studies have become founded like the approaches on chromosome  <dig> genes  <cit> , as well as the allen brain atlas  <cit>  and the emage gene expression database  <cit> . all of these projects cover a large amount of genes, but in comparison to our study they present only one tissue type or embryonic stage. with our approach, a large diversity of adult tissues and embryonic stages is covered. combined with the subcellular localisation data, we gain a lot of information about the genes in this particular region. as the possibility of performing specified queries might also be interesting for similar datasets on other chromosomal regions, researchers are welcome to contact us to get detailed technical information on our system.

CONCLUSIONS
to enhance the speed of gene identification of xq28-mapped diseases, we have startet to functionally describe the xq <dig> genes by expression analysis and subcellular localisation. our dataset is organised in a relational database with comprehensive query options. this database is freely accessible  <cit> . we have used the database to match potential affected tissues of xq28-mapped diseases with expression patterns of genes located within or close to the respective linkage region. by these means, we highlighted candidate genes for  <dig> of the  <dig> xq28-mapped diseases . by using our database and its query options, every researcher could prioritise candidate genes with individual focus. our results should enable faster disease gene identification by concentrating on these prioritised candidate genes in mutational screens.
