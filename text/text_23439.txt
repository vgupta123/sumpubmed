BACKGROUND

caenorhabditis elegans is a model organism widely used to interrogate host-pathogen interactions  <cit> . in recent years, studies in c. elegans have identified genes that are essential for immunity against bacterial and fungal pathogens. for instance, roles for p <dig> map kinase  <cit> , tgf-β  <cit> , daf-2/daf- <dig> insulin-like receptor signaling  <cit> , and the transcription factor zip- <dig>  <cit>  have been established in protection against bacterial or fungal infections in c. elegans. in addition, multiple studies have dissected the c. elegans transcriptional response to a range of different pathogens including bacillus thuringiensis  <cit> , pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureas  <cit> , serratia marcescens, enterococcus faecalis, erwinia carotovora, and photorhabdus luminescens  <cit> , and fungal pathogens including drechmeria coniospora  <cit> , harposporium sp.  <cit>  and nematocida parisii  <cit> . there is some overlap in the transcriptional responses to the various bacterial and fungal infections, suggesting that c. elegans maintains both “pan-microbial” and “microbe-specific” repertoires of pathogen response genes  <cit> . from the transcriptionally induced genes, some functional immune response genes have been identified and characterized.

much less is understood about host responses in c. elegans to viral infection, largely due to the lack of, until recently, a natural virus capable of infecting c. elegans. previous studies using artificial viral infection conditions with vaccinia virus  <cit> , nematode cells with vesicular stomatitis virus  <cit>  or a transgenic virus replicon system   <cit>  have demonstrated antiviral roles for the programmed cell death genes ced- <dig> and ced- <dig>  and rna interference  pathways in c. elegans. with the discovery of orsay virus, the first known natural viral pathogen of c. elegans, rnai and ubiquitin-mediated protection against viral infection have been described .

in addition to orsay virus, two related viruses, santeuil and le blanc, were discovered in wild caenorhabditis briggsae strains. orsay virus only infects c. elegans while santeuil virus and le blanc virus only infect c. briggsae  <cit> . all three viruses have a common tissue tropism and specifically infect the intestine  <cit> . the identification of multiple viruses that infect two host species that diverged ~ <dig> million years ago affords the unique opportunity to define evolutionarily conserved host responses to viral infection  <cit> . furthermore, c. elegans can also be infected specifically in the intestine by the microsporidia n. parisii  <cit> . thus, host responses to these various microbial pathogens can be compared and contrasted. in this study, to define the transcriptional response to these natural pathogens, we used high-throughput rna sequencing  to quantify the host mrna levels following different microbial infections. collectively, these results shed light on the host response to viral infection and provide insight into the larger context of antimicrobial defense in c. elegans.

RESULTS
c. elegans transcriptional response to orsay virus infection
to define the transcriptional changes in c. elegans upon orsay virus infection, we compared rna-seq results from infected and non-infected animals. we analyzed both the laboratory reference strain n <dig> as well as the rde- <dig> mutant, which bears a mutation in the argonaut protein rde- <dig> that is part of the rnai pathway. the rde- <dig> mutant sustains higher levels of orsay virus replication and accumulate ~100-fold more viral rna compared to n <dig>  <cit>  enabling us to assess the impact of more robust viral infection levels, as well as a defective rnai pathway, on the transcriptional response. samples were analyzed at 12 h post infection , a time by which orsay virus protein expression is observed in most rde- <dig> animals  <cit> . we used the edger package  <cit>  to identify differentially expressed genes  in both n <dig> and rde- <dig> strains . the vast majority of the degs were up-regulated, while a small subset of degs were down-regulated . among the induced genes, up-regulation ranged between  <dig> -fold to over 1000-fold compared to mock control .table  <dig> the number of c. elegans differentially expressed genes  upon different pathogen infection

between the two different strains of c. elegans, there were  <dig> degs shared, while there were  <dig> and  <dig> degs specific to n <dig> and rde- <dig>  respectively . the majority of the degs were of unknown function. for the subset that had annotations, we identified several enriched gene families and functions using the software package david  <cit> , . both n <dig> and rde- <dig> degs were enriched for several gene families including duf <dig> domain genes, duf <dig> domain genes, math  domain genes and a family of paralogs exemplified by c17h <dig>   . the c17h <dig> family genes have an ortholog in human, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  <dig> chromosome region candidate  <dig>  which encodes a protein of unknown function. most of the duf <dig> domain containing genes also contain an f-box domain, which is associated with the ubiquitin ligase pathway. the duf <dig> domain genes are specific to the caenorhabditis genus and do not have any associated functions. of the  <dig> degs that were specific to n <dig> infected with orsay virus, no statistically enriched gene families were identified. of the  <dig> rde- <dig> specific degs, there were several additional enriched gene families including cub-like domain genes, cub domain genes, and zinc finger  domain genes. in addition, innate immune response genes were enriched based on go annotation . for the degs that were shared between the two strains, rde- <dig> degs in general were induced to a greater degree .fig.  <dig>

to confirm the rna-seq results, we used quantitative real-time reverse transcription pcr  of an independent orsay virus infection in the n <dig> strain to evaluate transcript levels of three highly up-regulated genes  and two genes that did not change following viral infection . all five genes yielded similar results between transcriptional profiling and qrt-pcr .

orsay virus and n. parisii induced a shared transcriptional response
because the microsporidia n. parisii is also an intracellular pathogen of intestinal cells in c. elegans, we performed a parallel transcriptional profiling of n. parisii infection in n <dig>  there were  <dig> degs identified in n <dig> at  <dig> hpi of n. parisii ; notably  <dig> degs were shared with orsay virus infection of n <dig> . thus, the majority of the orsay virus induced degs in n <dig> were also differentially expressed following n. parisii infection. another  <dig> degs were shared between n. parisii infection of n <dig> and orsay infection of the rde- <dig> strain . interestingly, only two genes were down-regulated in both rde- <dig> upon orsay virus infection and n <dig> upon n. parisii infection. the two genes, pud- <dig> , and pud- <dig>  are paralogs known to be regulated by daf- <dig>  an insulin-like receptor  <cit> . of the  <dig> degs specific to n <dig> infected with n. parisii, the enriched gene families included zinc finger  domain genes and c-type lectin-like genes . we compared our results with a recently published expression profile of n. parisii infection, which was performed in a different genetic background  <cit> , and found the majority of the up-regulated genes that we identified were also up-regulated at 8 h post infection in the previous publication .

there were four gene families enriched across all infection conditions in c. elegans: orsay virus , orsay virus , and n. parisii  . f-box domain genes  and math domain genes are adapter proteins, which encode a cullin-binding domain and a substrate-binding domain that target proteins for e <dig> ubiquitin-ligase mediated proteolysis  <cit> . there were a total of  <dig> unique ubiquitin ligase adaptor genes that were highly up-regulated ,  <dig> of which were induced in all three conditions. specifically, f-box proteins act in concert with other proteins that are members of the skp/cullin/f-box  complex to facilitate ubiquitin-ligase mediated proteolysis. interestingly, skr- <dig>  a scf complex gene was up-regulated in all three infection conditions. furthermore, in the rde- <dig> orsay virus infected condition, two additional scf complex genes skr- <dig> and cul- <dig> were up-regulated.

the c17h <dig> family genes and duf <dig> domain genes have no known functions. for both the c17h <dig> family genes and duf <dig> domain genes, more than 50% of the family members were differentially expressed. the c17h <dig> gene family has a total of  <dig> members in c. elegans, and of those the same  <dig> members  were up-regulated following both orsay virus and n. parisii infection . the duf <dig> domain genes have a total of  <dig> members in c. elegans and have from 5– <dig> members of the gene family up-regulated following pathogen infection . the c17h <dig> family had the most degs represented in the orsay virus and n. parisii infections , and some of the genes were among the highest induced with close to 1000-fold increase compared to mock infection. given the highly distinct nature of orsay virus from the eukaryotic microsporidium n. parisii, this shared transcriptional response may represent a cellular stress pathway in c. elegans triggered by intracellular perturbation.fig.  <dig> heatmap of transcription profiles of selected gene families with multiple induced family members. the heatmap showed the log <dig> counts per million  for each gene in either c17h <dig> gene family or duf <dig> gene family. each experimental condition had three replicates and each replicate was represented in a column




evolutionarily conserved response to viral infection in c. elegans and c. briggsae
we next defined the degs in c. briggsae following santeuil virus infection. because the c. briggsae laboratory reference strain af <dig> does not support santeuil virus replication in our hands, we used the wild c. briggsae isolate ju <dig> which we had previously demonstrated to be susceptible to santeuil virus infection  <cit> . in c. briggsae, there were  <dig> degs following infection by santeuil virus . of the santeuil virus degs,  <dig> were down-regulated and  <dig> were up-regulated. on a technical note, ju <dig> sequence reads were mapped to the closely related af <dig> reference transcriptome; strain specific sequence differences may lead to incomplete mapping to some genes and thus a potential underestimate of the degs.

to confirm the rna-seq results, we used qrt-pcr of an independent santeuil virus infection of ju <dig> to evaluate transcript levels of two up-regulated genes: cbg <dig>  a gene with c. elegans orthologs that were also up-regulated, and cbg <dig>  an ortholog of the c17h <dig> family in c. briggsae. the two genes yielded similar results between transcriptional profiling and qrt-pcr .

approximately 60% of all genes in c. briggsae have well-defined orthologs in c. elegans  <cit> . we further compared the degs in c. elegans to their orthologous genes in c. briggsae. of the  <dig> genes identified as differentially expressed in either n <dig> or rde- <dig> or both ,  <dig> have orthologs in c. briggsae.  <dig> of these had c. briggsae orthologs that were also differentially expressed following santeuil infection . the majority  of the degs were up-regulated in both species. one gene, hmit- <dig> , was repressed in both the orsay virus  and the santeuil virus  conditions while clec- <dig> was repressed in orsay virus  and induced in santeuil virus . in total, there were  <dig> degs in the conserved response to viral infection.  <dig> c. elegans genes were induced in both n <dig> and rde- <dig> and had corresponding c. briggsae orthologs induced following santeuil infection. these, included  <dig> c17h <dig> family genes, four duf <dig> domain genes, a gene in the rnai pathway: c04f <dig> , and a gene downstream of daf-16: dod- <dig>  the remaining  <dig> genes have no known functions. there were two c. elegans degs in n <dig>  whose orthologs in c. briggsae were also degs. these were f14f <dig> , a zinc finger  domain gene and zk <dig> , the human ortholog of which is samhd <dig>  an antiviral gene against human immunodeficiency virus  <dig>  <cit> . finally, there were  <dig> c. elegans degs in rde- <dig>  with corresponding c. briggsae degs. six were immune related genes, four were zinc finger  domain genes, three were transcription factors , one was an rnai related gene  and the remainder had varying annotations .fig.  <dig> evolutionarily conserved pan-microbial responsive c. elegans genes. c. elegans genes differentially expressed following orsay and n. parisii infection that have orthologs in c. briggsae were differentially expressed. red shading indicates c. elegans genes whose orthologs in c. briggsae have conserved response to santeuil infection of c. briggsae





interestingly, the orthologs in c. briggsae of the duf <dig> genes and math domain genes that responded to both orsay virus and n. parisii infection were not differentially expressed following santeuil virus infection. this suggests that the induction of f-box and math genes may be a c. elegans specific transcriptional response. .

evolutionarily conserved pan-microbial response
in total,  <dig> of the  <dig> conserved viral degs were also differentially regulated following n. parisii infection . strikingly, all of the  <dig> degs that were conserved between the three viral infection conditions, orsay virus , orsay virus , and santeuil virus , were also n. parisii induced degs. specifically, members of the c17h <dig> and duf <dig> gene families appeared to be pan-microbial response genes while the zinc finger  gene responses were specific to viral infection . to further assess the potential roles of the conserved virus induced degs in the context of different pathogens, we compared our current results with previous published studies of pathogen induced host response. a prior microarray study of orsay virus infection of c. elegans identified multiple degs  <cit> , of which  <dig> degs were shared between the two studies in n <dig> background and  <dig> degs were shared in the rde- <dig> mutant . in addition, we identified additional statistically significant viral degs, possibly due to the use of synchronized animals. we examined a panel of representative bacterial pathogens including pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus thuringiensis, serratia marcescens, and photorhabdus luminescens  <cit>  and fungal pathogens including drechmeria coniospora and harposporium sp.  <cit> . all up-regulated and down-regulated degs identified from previous studies were compared to the up-regulated or down-regulated orsay virus degs. p. aeruginosa, p. luminescens and d. coniospora infection each shared a significant number of degs with orsay virus infection . notably, dod- <dig> was differentially expressed in all four instances. by contrast, there was an inverse association of e. faecalis degs with orsay virus degs , with fewer shared degs than expected by chance. finally, the other pathogens did not have a significant relationship with the orsay virus degs .table  <dig> conserved responses between bacterial or fungal pathogen to orsay virus degs

we also specifically investigated the transcriptional response of the c17h <dig> gene family members following infection by other pathogens. in prior published studies, p. luminescens and d. coniospora each induced multiple of the virally up-regulated c17h <dig> gene family members . interestingly, some of the c17h <dig> family genes that were not up-regulated following viral infection were differentially expressed following infection by d. coniospora, harposporium, p. luminescens, and s. marcescens . thus, there may be pan-microbial responsive c17h <dig> family members as well as those that respond to specific pathogens.

discussion
we defined the host transcriptional response to viral infection in c. elegans and c. briggsae. from our statistical analysis of orsay virus infections in n <dig> and rde- <dig> mutant strains, we identified a total of  <dig> degs in c. elegans, of which  <dig> degs were shared. in the rde- <dig> orsay virus infection, there were more degs compared to infection of n <dig>  in addition, the magnitude of the transcriptional changes in rde- <dig> was generally greater. one possible explanation for this observation is that the higher levels of viral infection in rde- <dig> may have created a more significant perturbation from the basal state, leading to a more robust transcriptional response. alternatively, the lack of competent rnai in rde- <dig> may have resulted in induction of a distinct, compensatory host response. one potential limitation of these studies is that orsay, santeuil, and n. parisii infection is thought to be limited to at most the  <dig> intestinal cells present in caenorhabditis nematodes. because our transcriptional profiling used rna extracted from populations of entire animals , some transcriptional responses may have been masked by the basal level of transcription in the uninfected cells, and thus our results are likely an underestimate of the transcriptional changes occurring in the intestinal cells.

strikingly,  <dig> of the n <dig> degs were also differentially expressed following infection with the microsporidium, n. parisii . orsay virus is a small single stranded rna virus with a bipartite genome of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb that is only known to encode three proteins  <cit> . by contrast, n. parisii has a  <dig>  mb genome and encodes more than  <dig> genes  <cit> . despite the lack of obvious similarity between these two microbes, the fact that a significant fraction of the transcriptional response to these two pathogens overlapped suggests that c. elegans may have some form of a universal “stress response”. one clear commonality between the two is that they are both intracellular intestinal pathogens of c. elegans; in fact they are the only intracellular pathogens of c. elegans described to date. thus, the conserved transcriptional response may reflect recognition of some shared intracellular perturbation. interestingly, although some of these shared response genes are potentially involved in the ubiquitin ligase pathway, the majority of the shared response genes are largely unannotated genes of unknown function. these genes could play important roles in immunity against pathogen infection. alternatively, it is also possible that these genes are important for pathogen infection, and that the pathogen alters the transcriptional response to facilitate infection and replication.

many of the characterized genes induced by orsay virus or n. parisii infection in c. elegans were genes in the ubiquitin ligase pathway. when challenged with either orsay virus or n. parisii, there were  <dig> unique f-box related or math domain genes up-regulated. in addition, scf complex genes, such as skr- <dig>  were up-regulated in all c. elegans infections while skr- <dig> and cul- <dig> were up-regulated in the rde- <dig> mutant infected with orsay virus. most of the f-box and math family members have sites in their substrate binding domains that are under strong positive selection and are greatly expanded in c. elegans in comparison to humans  <cit> . this suggests a possible role of ubiquitin ligase as part of the c. elegans host-pathogen interaction to restrict pathogen proliferation. indeed, scf ubiquitin ligases are demonstrated as a line of defense against infection by orsay virus and n. parisii in c. elegans  <cit> . intriguingly, none of the degs in c. briggsae were known f-box or math genes, suggesting that these ubiquitin ligase pathways may be a specific c. elegans response.

there are varying degrees of conservation between orsay virus response genes to other pathogens of c. elegans. we analyzed previously published transcriptional profiling studies of infection by  <dig> bacterial and fungal pathogens and identified three that have a significant fraction of degs shared with orsay virus infection. the three pathogens, p. aeruginosa, p. luminescens and d. coniospora, all can affect the intestine of the worm, but each does so in unique fashion. p. aeruginosa pa <dig> primarily kills by excreted toxins, p. luminescens colonizes the intestinal lumen, which is characterized by the appearance of cytosolic crystalline structures of unknown origin  <cit> , and d. coniospora produces threadlike hyphae that penetrate and eventually kill the infected animal  <cit> . other pathogens that also target the intestine such as e. faecalis and s. aureus did not have significant degs in common with orsay virus infection, demonstrating a specificity of the host response. the different responses of c. elegans to various pathogens suggest the existence of distinct sensing and regulatory mechanisms. one potential regulatory element in response to virus infection is drh- <dig>  a rig-i like protein in c. elegans. previous studies have determined that drh- <dig> both acts directly as a effector in the rnai pathway to restrict virus replication and as a sensor of virus infection critical for downstream host responses  <cit> .

comparative analysis of the degs in virus infected c. elegans and c. briggsae identified  <dig> c. elegans genes whose c. briggsae orthologs were also differentially expressed. of those,  <dig> were shared between the three conditions: orsay virus , orsay virus , and santeuil virus . strikingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were members of a single gene family, the c17h <dig> family genes in c. elegans. induction of members of this gene family in response to viral infection was conserved in two divergent caenorhabditis nematode species despite ~ <dig> million years of host evolution. furthermore, analysis of other published transcriptomes identified induction of c17h <dig> family genes by bacterial and fungal pathogens. the upregulation of a subset of these genes by disparate microbes such as virus, bacteria, and fungi raises the possibility that this gene family may form the core of a pan-microbial stress response. to date, there has been no reported function associated with these family members. the large number of paralogs induced following orsay virus or n. parisii infection suggests the possibility of functional redundancy, which would provide a challenge in experimental testing of the functions of these genes.

CONCLUSIONS
our transcriptional profiling study of both virus and microsporidium infection provides insights into the host response to pathogens. we found that distinct pathogens such as orsay virus and n. parisii elicited a similar set of degs in c. elegans, suggesting that these degs may constitute a broad pan-microbial response to infection. additionally, within the transcriptional profile of viral infection in the two different nematode species c. elegans and c. briggsae, we found a shared set of  <dig> evolutionarily conserved transcriptional responsive genes to viral infection, many of which have no known function. given the fact that diverse hosts regulate these common genes in response to distinct viral infections suggests that they play important roles. further studies are needed to define the impact and mechanism of action of these genes on viral infection.
