BACKGROUND
giardia species are binucleated parasitic protists of the group diplomonads  <cit> . members of this group differ extensively in their cytology and biochemistry from most other eukaryotes. g. intestinalis is the best explored species of this group  <cit> , and its small genome of  <dig> mb containing > <dig>  orfs has been completely sequenced recently  <cit> . as an important human pathogen of the upper intestinal tract, it was in the center of attention of medical parasitologists for many years  <cit> . its peculiar cytology, most notably the absence of typical mitochondria, made it an important organism in studies on the evolution of eukaryotic cells  <cit> . during the 1980s and 1990s, these apparently ancestral features led to the assumption that giardia species were representatives of the earliest, premitochondrial branches of the eukaryotic phylogenetic tree. recent work, however, cast serious doubt on this assessment of diplomonads and suggests that they are derived forms. the presence of mitosomes, organelles that probably derived from the ancestral mitochondrial endosymbiont  <cit> , and mitochondrial genes in its nuclear genome  <cit>  indicate that giardia is not ancestrally amitochondriate. efforts to establish the large scale phylogeny of eukaryotes did not resolve the order of separation of the major eukaryotic lineages and gave no support for an early divergence of diplomonads from other eukaryotes  <cit> .

a tight association between dna and small, highly basic proteins forms a highly organized arrangement called chromatin in the nucleus. histones are a major component of these basic proteins, and can be categorized as either core or linker types. in the primary "beads on a string" structure of chromatin, dna is wrapped around nucleosomes, which are composed of two molecules of each core histone protein . the linker histone h <dig> binds to the dna that stretches between adjacent nucleosomes and plays an important role in the formation of higher order chromatin structures within the nucleus. in addition to their role in the packaging of dna, the core histones can regulate transcription through modifications of their n-terminal tails, which is one of the major mechanisms for epigenetic regulation of gene expression  <cit> . there are two classes of core histone genes in higher eukaryotes: dna replication-independent or basal histones, and dna replication-dependent histones. the genes for the dna replication-independent histones are dispersed throughout the genome, are constitutively expressed, and their mrnas are polyadenylated. in contrast, the replication-dependent histone genes are arranged in tandem repeats within the genome, have elevated expression during the s-phase of the cell cycle, and their mrnas contain a conserved hairpin structure in the 3'utr instead of a poly tail  <cit> .

in this study, we have characterized the core histone genes of g. intestinalis. we determined the copy number, chromosomal localization, and the site of transcription initiation of these genes. the minimal promoter for the histone h <dig> gene was defined, and the role of a  <dig> bp conserved sequence within this promoter was analyzed. furthermore, the binding of proteins from a giardia nuclear extract to the  <dig> bp motif in the histone h <dig> promoter was examined. we were unable to detect a gene encoding the linker histone h <dig> 

RESULTS
two copies each of the h2a, h2b, and h <dig> genes, and three copies of the h <dig> gene were identified in the recently completed g. intestinalis genome  <cit>  . surprisingly, no gene encoding a h <dig> histone was found despite extensive searches. southern hybridization of bac clones containing these genes to blots of g. intestinalis chromosomes separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that the histone genes were dispersed on different chromosomes as follows: one copy of the h2a gene on chromosome  <dig> and the second copy on chromosome 5; both copies of h2b genes on chromosome  <dig> separated by approximately  <dig>  kb; the two copies of h <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig> separated by approximately  <dig>  mb; and the three copies of the h <dig> genes are localized to a  <dig> kb fragment near one end of chromosome  <dig>  two of the three copies of the h <dig> genes are positioned tail to tail near the end of one contig and the other is at the end of another adjacent contig. this raises the possibility that the detection of three copies of the h <dig> gene is an artifact of contig assembly and that there are only two copies of the h <dig> gene as is the case for other g. intestinalis core histone genes. to investigate this possibility, we designed pcr primers that flank the genomic dna region containing the copies of the h <dig> gene based on the sequence from the giardiadb assembly. since the dna fragment obtained from the pcr amplification of giardia genomic dna with these primers was of the same  <dig> kb size as the region predicted by the giardiadb assembly , the contig assembly of this region is probably correct and three copies of the h <dig> gene are present.

the dna sequences within the coding regions were identical for all copies of each g. intestinalis core histone gene except for  <dig> silent nucleotide substitutions between the two copies of the h2a gene. interestingly, the dna sequence conservation among the copies of each histone gene continued upstream of the coding region; the length of identical 5' noncoding sequence ranged from  <dig> bp for the h <dig> genes to  <dig> bp for the h <dig> genes. the lengths of identical 3' noncoding sequence between the copies of each histone gene are much shorter, ranging from only  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp, except for the h <dig> genes, which have  <dig> bp of identical 3' noncoding sequence. sequences matching the consensus polyadenylation signal  of g. intestinalis genes  <cit>  were present in the 3' noncoding sequences of all histone genes. this motif overlapped the translation stop codon in both copies of the h <dig> and h2b genes and in the other histone genes was located at positions from  <dig> to  <dig> bp downstream from the stop codon. examination of  <dig> bp centered on the putative polyadenylation signal of the genes did not reveal any sequence that could form the stem-loop structure that is conserved in the 3' utr of mrnas of replication-dependent histones found in higher eukaryotes  <cit> .

a number of conserved dna elements were detected in the upstream sequences of the four histone genes . the  <dig> bp conserved motif   <cit> , named here as the histone motif , is found in every copy of the core histone genes. two promoter elements, which were first characterized in the glutamate dehydrogenase gene of g. intestinalis  <cit> , were also recognized in this alignment: the at-rich sequence was present in the upstream sequence of h <dig> and h2a, and the giardia cat box  was present in the upstream sequence of h <dig> and h <dig>  the transcription initiation site for all four core histone genes was established at triplet a sites near the start of the coding region and downstream from him by determining the 5' ends of the histone mrnas with the technique of rapid amplification of 5' cdna ends  . the start of transcription for the h <dig> gene was confirmed by primer extension analysis, which produced a major extension product that mapped to the same nucleotide identified by 5' race . the core histone mrnas have very short 5' utrs, ranging from  <dig> nucleotides for h2a to just a single nucleotide for h2b, which is consistent with reported results for other giardia genes  <cit> .

to study the role of him in the expression of the core histone genes, we used the upstream sequence of the h <dig> gene to drive the expression of the luciferase reporter gene in transient transfections of giardia . an initial  <dig> bp of h <dig> upstream sequence was used because this is the length of sequence that is identical between the two copies of the h <dig> gene. only minor effects on luciferase activity were observed when the 5' flanking sequence was deleted to within  <dig> bp of the translation start codon . however, luciferase activity decreased five-fold if the him sequence was removed , and dropped to background levels when the remainder of the 5' flanking sequence was eliminated .

to further test the function of the conserved motifs in the histone h <dig> promoter, we made mutations to the  <dig> bp upstream sequence contained in the plasmid h4/5'Δ <dig> and assayed their effects on luciferase activity in giardia transfections . mutations to the g-cab element within him , as well as mutations in him outside of the g-cab element  caused marked decreases in luciferase activity. combining the * <dig> and * <dig> mutations of him into a single plasmid  resulted in a further decrease in luciferase activity. reductions in luciferase activities were also observed when mutations were introduced into the g-cab element overlapping the at-rich sequence  and in the at-rich sequence itself .

the relative strengths of the core histone promoters were tested by using the minimal upstream sequence of each gene that contained the him sequence to drive the expression of luciferase reporter constructs . transfections of these constructs into g. intestinalis showed that all four core histone promoters have similar activities. the relative expression of the four histone genes was nearly equal as shown by similar ct  values obtained in real-time qpcr experiments . by comparison, similar analysis of mrna for  <dig> other protein-encoding genes in g. intestinalis gave ct values that differ as much as  <dig> to  <dig> cycles .

we also found that the relative mrna levels of the four core histone genes did not differ in cells from exponential phase or from stationary phase cultures. the rna was extracted from these cultures and cdnas were synthesized using either a poly <dig> primer or a primer specific for each histone gene. the cdnas were then used as templates in pcr reactions on a real-time pcr instrument. table  <dig> shows the qpcr results from cdna synthesized from poly25-primed rna extracted from exponential cultures. the average ct numbers obtained for the four core histone genes differ by less than  <dig> amplification cycles; the numbers for the h <dig> and h <dig> genes are nearly identical, while those for h2a and h2b genes are slightly higher. similar results were obtained when these analyses were repeated with cdna generated from exponential phase rna by gene specific primers, and with cdna generated either by poly <dig> or gene specific primers from rna extracted from stationary phase cultures .

to test whether the him sequence is a binding site for transcription factors, gel-shift assays were performed with the use of a double-stranded dna probe containing three him motifs in tandem . several shifted complexes were observed when this probe was incubated with proteins from a giardia nuclear extract . the dna sequence specificity of the binding was tested by the addition of unlabeled, double-stranded dna containing different sequences at 100-fold molar excess to the probe. unlabeled dna containing the  <dig> bp minimal histone h <dig> promoter  or containing a single him sequence  were able to compete for protein binding to the probe . however, if him** <dig> dna with the mutations that cause a reduction in luciferase activity in transfections  was used as competitor, it had much less effect on protein binding . dna containing a sequence from the coding region of the histone h <dig> gene  did not compete with the 3him probe, nor did dna containing the adenovirus e1b tata-box . unexpectedly, the h <dig> promoter with deleted him sequence , and the minimal promoter of the g. intestinalis glutamate dehydrogenase  gene that contains no him sequence were also able to compete for protein binding . to investigate the possibility that the at-rich element present in h4/5'Δ <dig> and the gdh promoter is competing with protein binding to him, dna containing a single at-rich element  was used as a competitor in the gel-shift assay. the at-wt dna was able to compete with the 3him probe for protein binding , but an excess of at* <dig> , which contained mutations in the at-rich element that caused a reduction in luciferase activity in giardia transfections , was greatly reduced in its ability to compete with the 3him probe.

discussion
the sequences of the four core histones  of giardia intestinalis are similar to those of histones from other eukaryotes  <cit> . protein structure modeling of the putative translation products indicate that these proteins can assemble into nucleosomes that do not differ significantly from nucleosomes from vertebrates  <cit> . in the present study we extend this information to the copy number, promoter structure, and genomic distribution of the histone genes in this organism. each of these genes is represented in its genome by two copies only – with the exception of the h <dig> gene that is present in three copies. these copy numbers are at the low end of the scale observed among eukaryotes, ranging from just two copies of each gene in yeast,  <dig> to  <dig> copies in humans, and up to several hundred copies in sea urchins  <cit> . the unexpected extensive dna sequence identities between the copies of each of these genes, especially since they extend to the 5' noncoding region, suggest that these copies have arisen from relatively recent gene duplications or gene conversions.

all canonical replication-dependent histone genes in higher eukaryotes lack polyadenylation signals except for some invertebrate animals  that have core histone genes with both a stem-loop structure and a polyadenylation signal. these findings have led to the hypothesis that there has been a progressive replacement of the polyadenylation signal by the stem-loop structure in replication-dependent histones in defining the 3' ends of core histone mrnas during animal evolution  <cit> . the presence of polyadenylation signals and the absence of potential stem-loop structures in the 3' noncoding sequences of the giardia core histone genes suggest that studies on representatives of other eukaryotic lineages is warranted to determine whether a similar evolutionary trend is a more general phenomenon.

the linker histone h <dig> is a ubiquitous component of eukaryotic chromatin and is expected to be present in this protist. an earlier report putatively identified a  <dig> kda basic protein from nuclear extracts as histone h <dig>  <cit> . the identification was based on the size of the protein and on the sequence of one of its peptides  that was highly similar to a sequence within the chicken histone h <dig> protein . our inability to find this peptide or any homologs of h <dig> sequences from other organisms in the g. intestinalis genome database is therefore puzzling. more than an 11-fold coverage of the genome has been achieved by the giardia genome sequencing project  <cit> , so the possibility that the h <dig> gene was missed in the assembly is unlikely although it cannot be excluded. furthermore, we were not able to detect specific binding to any protein in a giardia histone extract with an antibody that recognizes the h <dig> protein in chicken, human and other mammals in western blot analysis .

these observations raise the problem of the identity of the protein isolated by triana et al.  <cit> . the failure to identify a histone h <dig> in the giardia genome indicates that this gene is either so divergent that it could not be recognized by our database searches or that it absent from this organism. no unambiguous h <dig> has been reported for apicomplexa  <cit> , and the h <dig> gene is non-essential in the ciliate, tetrahymena thermophila  <cit> . although tem analysis of giardia chromatin by triana et al. showed structures that were more compact than the "beads-on-a-string" nucleosome filament, it is unclear whether a  <dig> nm fibre structure is present. indeed, polynucleosome fibres in the presence of physiological levels of cations can fold further to form more compact chromatin structures in the absence of h <dig> histones  <cit> . in giardia, more than  <dig>  orfs are crammed into a genome that is only  <dig> mb in size. thus, it is tantalizing to speculate that the formation of histone h1-dependent chromatin structures may not be necessary to compact such a small and gene-rich genome. in support of this idea, we were also unable to identify a histone h <dig> in the microsporidian, encephalitozoon cuniculi, an evolutionarily distant organism with a genome less than  <dig> mb in size that contains almost  <dig>  protein encoding genes  <cit> . only further biochemical studies on giardia chromatin can clarify the conundrum of the missing histone h <dig> gene. if giardia indeed lacks a histone h <dig>  this finding would be consistent with the hypothesis that h <dig> histones were recruited in eukaryotic evolution after the acquisition of the core histones to further refine the chromatin structure  <cit> . however, further support for this hypothesis would require more detailed analysis of representative organisms from different lineages.

whereas the evolutionary origin of the core histones can be traced back to a dna binding protein in archaebacteria, such as the hmf protein in methanofermus fervidus  <cit> , the origin of the h <dig> histone is more difficult to determine. unlike the highly conserved core histone proteins, the h <dig> proteins are very heterogeneous among protozoa, and exhibit great diversification and specialization even among mammals  <cit> . nevertheless, the sequence similarity of small basic proteins found in several eubacteria to the lysine-rich carboxyl terminus of metazoan h <dig> proteins has led to speculations that these eubacterial proteins are candidates for the ancestral histone h <dig> protein  <cit> . in the dinoflagellate, crypthecodinium cohnii, proteins with similarity to the core histones are absent but two proteins  with significant similarity to the small molecular weight hu bacterial protein are present  <cit> . the hu protein is the most abundant dna-binding protein in e. coli, and one role of this multifunctional protein is the organization of the bacterial chromosomal dna  <cit> . intriguingly, an hu-like dna-binding protein was also identified by triana et al.  <cit>  based on a peptide sequence obtained from a small molecular weight protein on a sds-page gel of fractionated giardia chromatin. however, we were unable to locate an exact match of this peptide sequence in the giardia genome database by blastp and tblastn searches. the giardia sequence with the best match to the putative hu peptide was only  <dig> out of  <dig> amino acids. negative results were also obtained when the giardia genome was searched with the full-length hu sequence from bacillus subtilis. when the top five giardia sequences from each of the above searches were used individually in blastp and tblastn searches against all sequences in the genbank database, no hu nor other histone sequences were retrieved. possible explanations for our lack of finding the hu gene is that the hu-like gene was missed in sequencing of the giardia genome, or more likely, there was a bacterial contamination of triana et al.'s giardia chromatin preparation.

the transcription initiation site of the g. intestinalis histone genes was located only a few nucleotides upstream from the translation start codon, in agreement with previous studies showing that mrnas of this species have unusually short 5' utrs  <cit> . the translation of messages with such short 5' utrs has been a point of debate because earlier reports suggested that giardia mrna are uncapped  <cit> . recent studies, however, demonstrated more convincingly that giardia mrnas are capped, and that capped mrnas with 5'utrs as short as a single nucleotide can be efficiently translated in this protist  <cit> .

our results obtained with transient transfection assays with luciferase activity as indicator show that an about  <dig> bp upstream stretch has full promoter activity for g. intestinalis core histone genes. this is in agreement with results of transcriptional analysis of other giardia genes demonstrating promoter regions range from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length  <cit> . mutational analysis of these regions showed that the promoter elements are only weakly conserved and usually contain triplet a's and/or triplet t's  <cit> . the  <dig> bp histone motif  with the consensus sequence grgcgcagattngg, was detected in all four core histone genes, but has not been found in other giardia genes or in the core histone genes of other eukaryotes  <cit> . motivated by the assumption that him is a regulatory element that controls the coordinated expression of the giardia core histone genes, we decided to characterize the promoter of the histone h <dig> gene by analyzing its upstream sequence in more detail. the marked decrease in luciferase activity observed with deletions or mutations in him indicates the importance of this motif to the function of the histone h <dig> promoter. the highly conserved nature of the motif, and our observation that the four histone promoters had approximately equivalent activity, suggest that him also has an important regulatory role in the transcription of the other giardia core histone genes.

we used quantitative real time pcr to compare the steady state mrna levels of the four histone genes and found that they were all within a four-fold range  of each other. we did not detect any significant differences in the relative levels of core histone mrnas extracted from exponential phase cultures compared to mrnas from stationary phase cultures. moreover, we have not observed any marked changes in core histone mrna levels during the cell cycle in our analysis of gene expression in semi-synchronized giardia cultures . these results suggest that the core histone genes of g. intestinalis are constitutively expressed at approximately equivalent levels. these observations are also consistent with the absence of orthologs in this species to the transcription factors spt <dig>  spt <dig>  hir <dig> or hir <dig>  which are involved in the expression of replication-dependent histones in yeast  <cit> . therefore, the him sequence is likely to be a binding site for a transcription factor that allows a relatively high and constant level of histone gene expression in giardia. the equivalent results obtained by qrt-pcr assays using cdna produced from mrna with either poly or gene-specific primers demonstrate that the histone transcripts are polyadenylated. these observations suggest that the single class of core histone genes in giardia have a dual function: they provide bulk histones for packaging of newly synthesized dna during s-phase in the cell cycle, and provide replacement histones for the repair of chromatin during the other stages of the cell cycle.

while information on the identity and function of transcription factors in g. intestinalis is scarce, a recent survey of its genome identified only four general transcription initiation factors among the twelve that are normally associated with transcription in higher eukaryotes  <cit> . furthermore, a giardia tbp was identified that is highly divergent with respect to archaeal and higher eukaryotic tbps, and it contains substitutions in three out of four phenylalanines required for binding of other tbps to tata-sequences  <cit> . in this study, we showed that proteins from a giardia nuclear extract bound to a probe containing three him sequences in tandem, and demonstrated the specificity of these dna-protein interactions by competition assays with an excess of unlabeled dna containing different sequences. competition was observed with unlabeled dna containing the  <dig> bp minimal h <dig> promoter or a single wild type him sequence, but not with a region of the h <dig> coding sequence or with a canonical eukaryotic tata-box sequence. in addition, a mutated sequence of him had greatly reduced ability to compete for protein binding to the probe. while these results suggest that a protein or proteins are binding specifically to him, the competition observed with dna containing the h <dig> promoter with the him deleted and the gdh promoter lacking him appears to contradict this conclusion. however, these two sequences contain both an at-rich and a g-cab element, and we showed that the wild-type at-rich sequence was able to compete for protein binding to the 3him probe but the mutant at-rich sequence could not. taken together, these results suggest that either a common protein is binding to him as well as to the g-cab and at-rich elements, or more likely, a common cofactor is required for the formation of different protein complexes at each of these promoter elements. one possible candidate for this common cofactor is pot, a protein that was described in our previous characterization of the gdh promoter  <cit> . however, the identity of the proteins that bind him awaits the completion of our protein purification experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we identified a single class of core histone genes in g. intestinalis that are constitutively expressed at relatively high levels, and their mrnas are polyadenylated. there are two copies each of the core histone h2a, h2b and h <dig> genes, and three copies of the h <dig> gene, at separate locations on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> within the genome of giardia intestinalis. the low copy number of each basal histone gene, and the lack of a second class of replication-dependent genes may be further examples of genetic downsizing in this protist. our inability to locate a gene encoding the linker histone h <dig> leads us to speculate that the assembly of higher ordered chromatin structures that are h1-dependent may be restricted in giardia. if so, chromatin remodelling in this organism would be more dependent on histone modifications and the substitutions of histone variants into the nucleosomes. we determined that a  <dig> bp region upstream from the start of the histone h <dig> coding region is the minimal promoter, and a highly conserved  <dig> bp sequence motif called the histone motif  is essential for its activity. our gel-shift assays showed that a common factor is shared between the protein complex that binds to him and the complexes that bind other promoter elements described previously in giardia. given the short lengths  of promoters in this protist, it is likely that only a single protein complex, composed of a core set of transcription factors, can form on these regions. gene-specific transcription factors, such as the him-binding protein, would interact with and modulate the activity of the core complex. the implications of such genetic streamlining on the nature of transcription initiation in giardia are unknown. further study of these transcription factors and chromatin structure in g. intestinalis would provide a clearer picture of gene expression in this remarkable eukaryote.
