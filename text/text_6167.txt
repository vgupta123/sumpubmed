BACKGROUND
il- <dig> is a pleiotropic cytokine, which exhibits multiple biological activities which are determined by expression of il-11rα and gp <dig> on the cell membrane  <cit> . originally it was identified in  <dig> as a molecule promoting growth of the il-6-dependent mouse plasmacytoma cell line b <dig>  <cit> . it has been demonstrated later, that il- <dig> exhibits multiple effects not only on hematopoietic system, but it also acts on various cell types of the liver, gastrointestinal tract, lung, heart, central nervous system, bone, joint and immune system  <cit> . il- <dig> acts synergistically with other growth factors in the process of hematopotic cells differentiation including progenitor cells, and on megakaryocytopoiesis, thrombopoiesis, erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis  <cit> . moreover, il- <dig> displays anti-melanoma activity when used as molecular adjuvant in the therapeutic whole cell melanoma vaccine formulation  <cit> .

il- <dig> together with il- <dig>  il- <dig>  leukemia inhibitory factor , oncostatin m , ciliary neurotrophic factor , cardiotrophin  <dig> , cardiotrophin-like cytokine  and neuropoietin  belongs to the family of hemopoietic cytokines , which share structural similarity and a common receptor subunit   <cit> . some of the il-6-type cytokines require a specific  receptor complex, however, always one or two subunits of a common transmembrane transducer receptor gp <dig> is required. il- <dig> and il- <dig> engage a homodimer of gp <dig>  other il-6-type cytokines like lif, ct- <dig>  cntf, np, clc need lif receptor  and gp <dig>  osm binds first to gp <dig> and then with either lifr or osmr. il- <dig> forms signaling complex with gp <dig> and wsx- <dig> . moreover, some of the il- <dig> type interleukins first bind to a specific receptor alpha and then engage signal transducer subunits  <cit> . cytokines utilizing gp <dig> molecule induce signaling via the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription  pathway and also the mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascade  <cit> .

specifically, the il- <dig> receptor complex is formed via three separate events. first, il- <dig> binds with low affinity to membrane specific receptor α. next, il-11/il-11rα heterodimer binds with high affinity to receptor gp <dig> forming heterotrimer. at the last stage, the heterotrimers associate forming a hexameric complex that elicits the biological response. the stoichiometry of the high affinity il- <dig> receptor complex has been determined in vitro as a hexamer consisting of two il- <dig> molecules, two il-11rα chains and a homodimer of two gp <dig> molecules  <cit> .

the gp <dig> protein was found on all human cell types so far studied, however the expression of other il-6-type receptor subunits is limited. cells that express the proper subunit will be sensitive to the respective cytokine. moreover, soluble forms of the alpha receptors lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains were found  <cit> . soluble forms of cytokine receptors can be produced by limited proteolysis of the membrane-bound receptor or by translation of alternatively spliced mrna  <cit> . cells that do not express receptor α can be sensitive to the complex of cytokine/soluble cytokine receptor α. recombinant soluble il-11rα  can bind il- <dig> and then the comples attracts gp <dig> leading to signal transduction  <cit> . the complex of il-11/sil-11rα can activate cells bearing both il-11rα and gp <dig> subunits or gp <dig> only. the recombinant sil-11rα acts in vitro as il- <dig> agonist, although antagonizing activity was also observed  <cit> .

in order to increase and modify the potential bioactivity of some cytokines, the idea of linking of two soluble, naturally existing components was postulated. the fusion proteins are expected to be more stable and are needed at a lower effective dose. examples derived from il-6-type cytokines include fusion proteins consisting of different fragments of alpha receptors and their cognate cytokines like il-6/sil-6r , il-11/sil-11rα  and cntf/scntfr   <cit> . here, we constructed a novel cytokine hyper il- <dig> , which is composed of naturally existing components only. it contains the full length soluble il-11rα connected with il- <dig>  since the natural sequence of c-terminus of il-11rα and n-terminus of il- <dig> were used, we could refrain from using artificial linker sequences for the connection of both components.

RESULTS
construction of h11
our new designer cytokine hyper il- <dig>  is composed exclusively of naturally existing components. it contains the full length soluble il-11rα connected with il- <dig>  the cdna fragment of s il-11rα  and the cdna of il- <dig>  were amplified by pcr. the forward primer contained an additional recognition sequence for the restriction enzyme sali. moreover, acc nucleotides in front of atg and substitution a for g just after the translational start codon atg were introduced in order to provide the kozak consensus sequence and a restriction site ncoi, respectively. the reverse primer for amplification of il-11rα contained an additional 5' overlapping sequence on il- <dig> at position  <dig> where a natural restriction site xhoi occurs. moreover, the amplified fragment omitted the leader sequence of il- <dig> with exception of natural sequence coding the last three amino acids  of the leader sequence which are now at the n termini of the il- <dig> component. the restriction site xhoi was used to connect both components. the membrane proximal region of the il-11rα  and the  <dig> n-terminal residues of il- <dig> are not helical and presumably flexible enabling the proper assembly of the complex. the sequence and schematic representation of the fusion complex are shown in figure  <dig>  moreover, the details of the h <dig> construction have been described in patent no wo <dig>  <cit> .

production and purification of h <dig> protein
the production of recombinant h <dig> protein was carried out in a baculovirus expression system. high-five bti-tn-5b1- <dig> insect cells were used, which were transduced at a density of 1x <dig> cells/ml using moi  <dig>  the h <dig> production was carried out for  <dig> h in express five sfm medium. the purification of fusion protein was carried out by ion exchange chromatography. purified h <dig> from the q sepharose xl bed was eluted at  <dig> mm nacl/ <dig> mm  <dig>  diaminopropane buffer ph  <dig> . the quality and quantity of the fusion protein was determinated by sds-page gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis . the intensive band, which migrated in sds-page below  <dig> kda bsa , was recognized by anti- il-11rα antibody which binds h <dig>  the observed molecular weight of h <dig> was slightly above the calculated one  what might be due to the n-glycosylation. the n-glycosylation of il-11rα was described before  <cit> . although, h <dig> produced in insect cells may differ in pattern of glycosylation when compared with one produced in mammalian cells  <cit> . the glycosylation was shown not to be critical for ligand gp <dig> interaction  <cit> . the average yield of purified h <dig> was  <dig> μg from  <dig> l of cell supernatant.

activity of h11
the purified recombinant h <dig> was tested for biological activity in three different in vitro bio-assays: human hepatoma cell line hepg2-assay, murine b <dig>  bio-assay, and murine ba/f3-gp <dig> bio-assay.

stimulation of α <dig> antitrypsin in hepg <dig> cells by h <dig>  hepg <dig> cells secrete endogenous il- <dig>  which makes them unresponsive to exogenous il- <dig>  however, hepg <dig> insensibility to il- <dig> can be restored by the addition of s il-11rα  <cit> . incubation of hepg <dig> cells with h <dig> stimulated in a dose dependent manner the expression and secretion of a read-out plasma protein-α <dig> antitrypsin as measured by rocket immunoelectrophoresis .

proliferation of b <dig> cells. b <dig> cells express il-11rα and gp <dig> receptors, making them responsive to il- <dig>  <cit> . stimulation of b <dig> cells with il- <dig> and h <dig> led to induction of their proliferation . to obtain comparable levels of b <dig> proliferation, h <dig> was applied at a 10-fold lower molar concentration than il- <dig>  the highest proliferation of b <dig> cells was achieved with  <dig> pm il- <dig>  since no saturation was reached at this concentration, we are not sure whether application of higher il- <dig> concentration would increase b <dig> proliferation further. application of il- <dig> at higher dose was impossible due to the technical reasons. when b <dig> cells were stimulated with h <dig>  a concentration of  <dig>  pm was sufficient for maximal proliferation. the difference between il- <dig> and h <dig> activity was probably due to the low expression of the il- <dig> receptor. indeed, h <dig> composed of active il- <dig> and sil-11rα induced much stronger proliferation of b <dig> cells.

proliferation of ba/f3-gp <dig> cells. the unique feature of ba/f <dig> cells  is the lack of membrane gp <dig> molecules, which makes them unresponsive to il- <dig> type cytokines. however, stable transfection of ba/f <dig> cells with gp <dig> cdna made them responsive to the combination of il- <dig> type cytokine and its α receptor  <cit> . stimulation of ba/f3-gp <dig> cells with recombinant h <dig> led to their propagation, as measured using mtt test . ba/f3-gp <dig> cells did not proliferate in medium without stimuli however, h <dig> stimulated these cells in a at dose dependent manner. the ba/f3-gp <dig> assay proved that the new designer cytokine h <dig> was acting as a complex.

signal transduction mediated by h11
signal transduction of il- <dig> and related cytokines via the common signal transducer gp <dig> is mediated by the activation jak/stat and ras/mapk signaling pathways  <cit> . active jaks mediate phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of the receptors and subsequent recruitment of stat3/ <dig> and shp- <dig>  in order to show that stat <dig> activation was effected by h <dig>  ba/f3-gp <dig> cells were stimulated with the hypercytokine and the phosphorylated forms of stat <dig>  were detected using flow cytometry. as indicated in figure  <dig>  contrary to il- <dig>  the stimulation with h <dig> led to activation of stat  <dig> molecule, indicating that h <dig> activity was not due to an altered mechanism.

differentiation study of hematopoietic lin-cd34+ cells
to order to compare the effects of hyper-il- <dig> and h <dig> on differentiation of lin-cd34+ in liquid cell cultures, analysis of expression of cell surface antigens was performed on day  <dig> . anti-cd <dig> antibody was used to evaluate granulopoesis and anti-cd235a antibody to assess erythropoiesis. the number of cells expressing myeloid marker cd <dig> was highest in cultures containing hyper-il-6; . in contrary, h <dig> promoted differentiation of lin-cd34+ towards erythroid cells. the number of cd235a+ cells was 39% in h <dig> stimulated culture, 27% in hyper-il- <dig> and 20% in control culture .

discussion
concept of the construction of recombinant fusion proteins derived from il- <dig> cytokines is not new. it is based on the strategy of linking the cytokines and their cognate soluble α receptor. the α receptors posses extracellular n-terminal domain and one transmembrane domain . structurally, following predicted regions can be distinguished:  signal peptide,  ig-like region-d <dig> domain,  cytokine binding homology domain  consisting of two fibronectin-type-iii-like domains  termed d <dig> and d <dig> ,  receptor pre-membrane region,  transmembrane, and  cytoplasmic regions. the designed fusion proteins contained different structural parts of its α receptor. hyper-il- <dig> consisted of d <dig> and d <dig> domain of il-6r α chain  connected to il- <dig>  via artificial polypeptide linker  <cit> . hyper-il- <dig> is a fully active fusion protein, which mediates response at 10-1000-fold lower doses as compared to the combination of soluble il- <dig> and sil-6r molecules  <cit> . in analogy, another superagonist was designed named il-11/r-fp  <cit> . il-11/r-fp was created by covalently linking d <dig> and d <dig> domains of il-11rα  with il- <dig>  using a  <dig> amino acid linker. it demonstrated  <dig> fold higher activity in vitro than the combination of il- <dig> and sil-11rα. however, such construct was also composed of interleukin and a truncated segment of the alpha receptor , so it lacked naturally existing parts of the used receptor. moreover, the used artificial linker is not a naturally occurring sequence, thus it might demonstrate potential immunogenicity when used for treatment of human patient. hyper-cntf was another example of a superagonist composed of scntfr  and cntf   <cit> . it differed from the previous il- <dig> type fusion proteins , since it included the ig domain of scntfr. although the d <dig> domain of the interleukin alpha receptor is mainly involved in ligand binding  <cit>  and its d2-d <dig> part is sufficient to induce biological activity in vitro  <cit> , the role of the ig-like domain and the membrane proximal region can not be disregarded. it was shown that the ig-domain of the il-6r is important for intracellular transport of il-6r through the secretory pathway  <cit> . it can also be involved in interdomain stabilization or induction of conformational change of the ligand. moreover, for fusion of cntfr and cntf the c-terminal end of cntfr and n-terminal end of cntf was used, which were linked by one additional glycine residue  <cit> . a synthetic polypeptide linker was not applied in order to minimize potential immunogenicity. the mentioned terminal ends are presumably flexible and sufficient to allow access of cytokine to its receptor alpha binding sites. indeed, hyper-cntf was biologically active  <cit> . in terms of construction, our hyper-il- <dig>  resembles mostly hyper-cntf. it is composed of full length of soluble il- <dig> receptor and il- <dig>  and both elements are connected by natural existing parts of receptor and interleukin. it differs from hyper-cntf, since the additional glycine residue was not incorporated in the fusion and also the flexible termini of sil-11rα and il- <dig> generated a longer linker. for construction of hyper-il- <dig>  a  <dig> aa linker was used, while for il-11/r-fp  <dig> aa and hyper-cntf  <dig> aa were applied  <cit> . with our hyper-molecule, a  <dig> aa linker was generated, since the pre-membrane region of il-11rα  together with  <dig> n-terminal residues of il- <dig> is not helical and presumably flexible. it should enable the proper positioning of the fusion molecule. in general, the construction of our hyper-cytokine has two major advantages:  its components are as close as possible to the natural forms of both proteins and  omitting of the artificial linker should prevent possible immunogenicity and other side effects due to the non-natural recombinant agent.

in the case of hyper-il- <dig>  the high potency of the designer cytokine is based on the fact that the affinity of il- <dig> to the il-6r is in the range of  <dig> nm whereas the affinity of the complex of il- <dig> and il-6r is 6r is around 10- <dig> pm, which is about  <dig> times higher. if the affinities between il- <dig> and the two receptor subunits are in the same range, this would explain the high biologic activity of the h <dig> protein.

although sil-11rα was not found in human body fluids so far, its existence has been postulated due to identification of a transcript potentially encoding sil-11rα  <cit> . the recombinant sil-11rα in vitro acts as il- <dig> agonist  <cit> . in addition, the sil-11rα not only potentiated effects of the il- <dig> on cells that are normally responsive to il- <dig>  but also in the presence of il- <dig> it mediated a signal transduction in cells expressing gp <dig> molecules only  <cit> . however, the concentration of il- <dig> required to mediate a biological response using sil-11rα had to be 10- 20-fold higher than using membrane receptor  <cit> . expression of il-11rα is limited to certain cell types, while gp <dig> is present on all cells of the body. thus, the use of the sil-11rα significantly widens the range of il- <dig> bioactivity. furthermore, sil-11rα can act as an il- <dig> antagonist when tested on cells expressing the membrane il-11rα and gp <dig>  <cit> . the antagonism probably resulted from the competition between soluble and cellular il-11rα for il- <dig> and/or was depended on the number of gp <dig> molecules  <cit> . our hyper-il- <dig> acts as agonist when tested in hepg2-assay, in b <dig> and in ba/f3gp <dig> bio-assays. since sil-11rα presumably is already occupied by il- <dig>  it does not compete with endogenous il- <dig> or membrane bound il-11rα, which explains its agonistic activity. the previously described molecule il-11/r-fp also acted as agonist when tested in hepg <dig> and ba/f3-gp <dig> assays  <cit> . when ba/f3-gp <dig> cells were stimulated with il-11/r-fp, a concentration 130- <dig> pm was sufficient for half-maximum proliferation. our h <dig> induced the half-maximum proliferation at the dose of approximately 800- <dig> pm. however, il-11/r-fp was non purified and its calculated concentration could be misleading. according to pflanz et al. the concentration of il-11/r-fp in the yeast supernatant was calculated from the band intensities of il-11/r-fp and serial dilutions of il- <dig> preparation of a known concentration measured by a lumi-imager  <cit> . since the analyzed material was derived from not purified yeast supernatant, presumably the concentration was calculated after immunoblotting . our experience indicated that antibodies anti il- <dig> or il-11rα not necessarily recognize fusion molecule with the same affinity. when several elisa systems were used to measure h <dig> concentration, different results were obtained . the antigenic determinant at a fusion molecule may be hidden or partially hidden when compared with the epitope of parental components , what can explain the observed differences. in order to compare correctly the activity of both fusion proteins  the experiment should be conducted simultaneously using purified proteins, which concentration was calculated with the same method.

after binding to their cognate α receptor, cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig> engage a homodimer of gp <dig> in order to elicit signal transduction. since, both designer cytokines, h <dig> and hyper-il- <dig> compromise of cytokine and its cognate α receptor, they need the same receptor subunits for signal transduction. that is why h <dig> and hyper-il- <dig> may be functionally equivalent. according to our preliminary results h <dig> retains in part an il-11rα-specific activity that is directed by h <dig> interaction with gp <dig>  in terms of hematopietic differentiation h <dig> increased expression of early erythroid antigen. il- <dig> is well known to be involved in the expansion of megakaryiocyte progenitors, and megakariocytes derive from common megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitor  <cit> . however, hyper il- <dig> did not exert the same effect. contrary, it stimulated myelopoiesis, what is in agreement with previous data  <cit> . although, il- <dig> and il- <dig> share the common receptor subunit , they bind to the different sites on it  <cit> , what can influence on the specific response mediated by gp <dig> signaling. the proliferation of tf <dig> cells induced by il- <dig> but not by il- <dig> could be inhibited by a specific antibody anti gp <dig> . on the other hand, using sk-n-mc cells, the same antibody could not block the phosphorylation of gp <dig> induced by il- <dig> and by il- <dig>  <cit> . moreover, pha-activated t-cells responded to il- <dig> by mobilization of a heterodimer stat1/stat <dig> and homodimer stat <dig>  while il-11/sil-11rα by a stat <dig> homodimer and stat3/stat <dig> heterodimer  <cit> . these results indicated that although structurally cytokines share the same signal transducing unit, its activation may elicit different effects, like different global phosphorylation level, activation of different stat molecules what may influence the final biological activity. such difference may be critical to activation of distinct regulation processes depending on the cell origin. however, whether this kind of differences are responsible for diverse action of h <dig> and hyper-il- <dig> needs to be evaluated.

since il- <dig> is a pleiotropic cytokine of hematopoietic and anti-inflammatory properties, h <dig> may be potentially beneficial in the treatment of various diseases. il- <dig> is the only agent approved by usa food and drug administration  to prevent severe thrombocytopenia and reduce the need for platelet transfusion following myelosuppressive chemotherapy for non-myeloid malignancies. accordingly, studies of h <dig> in similar models are required. even if in vivo studies demonstrate unacceptable toxicity it does not exclude utility of h <dig> for ex vivo expansion of megakaryocyte precursor cells. our preliminary in vitro studies have indicated great potential of h <dig> for megakaryocyte expansion . moreover, recent studies have shown that il- <dig> regulated the autoimmune demyelination disease-multiple sclerosis   <cit> . due to its dual action: immunomodulatory and neuroprotective/regenerative, il- <dig> may display a unique potential to treat ms. loss of il-11rα expression was associated with severe symptoms of autoimmune encephalomyelitis  in the mouse model of ms. il- <dig> treatment of mice with eae gave partial, albeit statistically significant, therapeutic benefit. another example of potential h <dig> utility is to treat infertility. mice lacking il-11rα are infertile due to defective uterine response to implantation  <cit> . accordingly, h <dig> which can omit il-11rα and directly achieve gp <dig> may prove to be beneficial in pregnancy.

CONCLUSIONS
we constructed a designer cytokine hyper il- <dig> , which is exclusively composed of naturally existing components. it contains the full length sil-11rα linked with the il- <dig> using their natural sequences. accordingly, h <dig> should not induce of the antibody production and other side effects due to the non-natural recombinant agent. the purified recombinant h <dig> is a fully active protein. it displayed biological activity in three different in vitro bio-assays: human hepatoma cell line hepg2-assay, b <dig> and ba/f3-gp <dig> proliferation assays. moreover, it differs in terms of differentiation of hematopoietic cells when compared to the hyper-il- <dig> 

since there are disorders due dysfunction of il- <dig> or il-11rα, h <dig> may be potentially applied in the biomedical field. it may be useful for treatment of thrombocytopenia, infertility, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular diseases or inflammatory disorders. it should be noted however, that due to the fact that hyper-il- <dig> could stimulate all cells in the body, a strategy to properly target the designer cytokine needs to be developed.
