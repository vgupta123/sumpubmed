BACKGROUND
salt stress affects crop productivity worldwide, especially in irrigated lands  <cit> , and can thus lead to dramatic consequences in food availability. hence, determinants of plant salt tolerance are intensively investigated to identify targets for plant breeding and to create salt tolerant varieties. three cellular components of salt tolerance have been proposed in plants:  osmotic stress tolerance,  na+ exclusion capacity and  tissue tolerance to na+ accumulation  <cit> . unlike halophytic species, the glycophytic plant-model arabidopsis thaliana is sensitive to moderate levels of nacl. this has raised the question of its relevance in salt tolerance studies  <cit> . however, thanks to genetic and molecular tools developed around this species, several genes involved in plant salt tolerance have been highlighted. thus, many mutants or transgenic lines of a. thaliana were shown to display differential levels of nacl tolerance and this mostly concerned genes involved in ion transport  <cit> , detoxication processes  <cit>  or metabolite biosynthesis  <cit> .

among stress-responsive metabolites, γ-aminobutyric acid is of special interest since the molecule accumulates in response to a wide range of environmental stimuli  <cit>  although its function in plants is still a matter of debate  <cit> . gaba is a widespread non protein amino acid, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. it has been first discovered in plants in the middle of the 20th century  <cit>  but rapidly attention shifted to its signaling function in mammals central nervous system as a neurotransmitter. in plants, speculative functions have been attributed to gaba metabolism such as osmoregulation  <cit>  and glutamate homeostasis control  <cit> . moreover, it has been demonstrated to participate to ph regulation  <cit>  and bypass of tca cycle  <cit> . gaba has also been shown to act as a signaling molecule in plants as reported for nitrate uptake modulation  <cit> , 14-3- <dig> genes regulation  <cit>  and pollen tube growth and guidance  <cit> .

in plants and animals, gaba metabolism is sum up in a three-enzyme-pathway that takes place in two cellular compartments . gaba is mainly synthesized from l-glutamate owing to the activity of the cytosolic glutamate decarboxylase . gaba is then transported into the mitochondrion to be catabolized by the gaba transaminase  which converts gaba to succinic semialdehyde   <cit> . subsequently, ssa is oxidized by the mitochondrial succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase  to produce succinate  <cit> . alternatively, ssa can also be reduced in the cytosol via the activity of the γ-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase  that produces γ-hydroxybutyrate   <cit> .

most of attention has been focused on gaba synthesis under environmental stress owing to changes of catalytic properties of plants gad depending on cytosolic ph and activity of ca2+/calmodulin complex  <cit> , two known stress-modulated factors  <cit> . on this basis, it has been hypothesized that gaba level could be mainly controlled by the rate of its synthesis. however, isolation and characterization of arabidopsis gaba-t deficient mutants demonstrated that gaba levels could also result from the rate of its degradation  <cit> . arabidopsis genome contains only one gaba-t encoding gene   <cit> , subsequently termed pop <dig>   <cit> , whereas  <dig> genes putatively encode gad   <cit> . pop <dig> uses pyruvate as gaba amino group acceptor   <cit> , while in mammals gaba-t exclusively uses 2-ketoglutarate as amino group acceptor   <cit> . recently, it has been shown that pop <dig> can also uses glyoxylate as amino acceptor and thus produces glycine  <cit> . pop <dig> gene product is a  <dig>  kda polypeptide with a pyridoxal-5-phosphate binding domain and a mitochondrial peptide signal  <cit> , and shares little homology with non-plant gaba-t genes  <cit> . in a.thaliana, pop <dig> gene was linked to responsiveness to volatile e-2-hexenal  <cit> , alanine accumulation occurring in roots during hypoxia  <cit>  and growth and guidance of pollen tubes  <cit> .

in this study, we investigated the regulation of gaba metabolism upon nacl treatments in a. thaliana at the metabolite, enzymatic activity and gene transcription levels. we identified the gaba-t step as a key point of regulation of gaba metabolism and further performed a functional analysis of the pop <dig> gene that encodes gaba-t.

RESULTS
gaba-t is the most responsive step of gaba metabolism upon nacl stress in a. thaliana
no data specifically devoted to description of gaba level changes under nacl stress conditions are to date available in a. thaliana. hence, we followed the kinetics of gaba level changes and its organ partitioning in wild-type plantlets  subjected to  <dig> mm nacl treatment. figure 2a shows that gaba readily accumulated during nacl treatment in a. thaliana at the whole-plant level. after  <dig> days of treatment, gaba content reached  <dig> -fold higher level in nacl-treated plantlets than in control ones . under control conditions, gaba was shown to be much more abundant in root tissues than in shoot tissues  whereas, after  <dig> days of treatment with nacl, shoot and root tissues exhibited about equal amount of gaba . shoots of nacl-treated plantlets were actually shown to accumulate 14-fold more gaba than control ones while roots accumulated only  <dig> -fold more gaba .

gad and gaba-tp catalytic activities were determined in vitro in wt plantlets subjected to nacl treatments to decipher biochemical determinants of gaba accumulation. gad activity showed surprising variations  in response to nacl treatment. it was thus found to be significantly decreased in plantlets treated for  <dig> h with  <dig> mm nacl while, after  <dig> days of treatment, it reached  <dig> -fold higher level than in control plantlets . gad activity was not shown to be significantly different in plantlets treated for  <dig> days with  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm nacl . figure 2e shows that gaba-tp activity increased rapidly in response to treatment with  <dig> mm nacl. in plantlets treated for  <dig> days, gaba-tp activity was  <dig> -fold higher than in control plantlets  and was actually found to respond to nacl in a dose-dependent manner .

it was of interest to ascertain whether enzymes activities were correlated with changes in transcriptional activity of gaba metabolism genes. to achieve this objective, genes expression analysis was performed by qrt-pcr on total rna isolated from entire wt plantlets treated for  <dig> h with increasing concentrations of nacl. primers were designed in order to ensure specific amplification . as shown in figure 2g, only the expression of  <dig> gad genes was detectable under our experimental conditions. gad <dig> and gad <dig>  the two most expressed paralogs, showed contrasted expression changes in response to nacl treatments. gad <dig> expression, which is root-specific  <cit> , was shown to be gradually restricted as far as nacl concentration increased. on the opposite, gad <dig> expression, which is present in all parts of plant  <cit> , was significantly enhanced when the salt level exceeded  <dig> mm . gad <dig> expression was much lower than those of the two other gad isoforms but it was found to be significantly enhanced in nacl-treated plantlets . gad <dig> expression was indeed  <dig> -fold higher in plantlets treated for  <dig> h with  <dig> mm nacl than in control plantlets. in such plantlets, pop <dig> expression was  <dig> -fold higher than in control plantlets  and was actually found to be the most expressed gene of the gaba metabolism suggesting a pivotal function in salt stress responses. interestingly, ssadh expression was also enhanced at  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm nacl concentrations  indicating that whole gaba catabolism was transcriptionally up-regulated upon nacl treatment. in parallel, expression of Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase  <dig> , a well-known salt stress-induced gene involved in proline synthesis  <cit> , was shown to be gradually induced, thus validating our experimental conditions .

the gaba-t deficient mutant pop2- <dig> is ovsersensitive to nacl
we tested the sensitivity to nacl of the previously isolated gaba-t deficient pop2- <dig> mutant  <cit>  on agar medium and under more physiological conditions in soil. in both case, nacl treatment induced severe phenotype in the mutant, even death on agar medium supplemented with  <dig> mm nacl, whereas no obvious difference occurred under control conditions between the mutant and its wt . nacl sensitivity was more obvious at the root level since no clear symptoms appeared in aerial part of plants for nacl concentrations below  <dig> mm . as a convenient way to decipher pop2- <dig> oversensitivity to nacl, we compared primary root growths of pop2- <dig> mutant and wt on agar media supplemented with various salts or osmoticum. as shown in figure 4a, pop2- <dig> root growth was found to be oversensitive to nacl. unlike to wt, mutant root growth was indeed sharply reduced at  <dig> mm nacl and decreased linearly as nacl concentration increased in the medium . nacl concentration that induced 50% inhibition of root growth  was close to  <dig> mm for pop2- <dig> and  <dig> mm for wt. furthermore, this response was mainly due to na+ because treatments with increasing concentration of kcl were less inhibitory for root growth of the mutant . the possibility of a pleiotropic sensitivity to toxic cations of pop2- <dig> was ruled out since the mutant did not display special phenotype in response to  <dig> mm spermidine and  <dig> μg/ml kanamycin . in this context, it was of interest to verify whether pop2- <dig> root growth was also affected by osmotic stress. for this purpose, we used osmotically active concentrations of mannitol and osmotically non-active concentrations of the highly toxic licl. thus, pop2- <dig> mutant did not appear to be oversensitive to mannitol  while licl induced a strong inhibition of pop2- <dig> root growth . these observations indicate that pop2- <dig> mutant is oversensitive to ionic stress, but not to osmotic stress.

treatment of 10-day-old plantlets with  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> days induced a greater growth inhibition in pop2- <dig> than in wt . the pop2- <dig> growth restriction was not associated with overaccumulation of na+  or cl-  in plant tissues that might lead to a higher internal ionic stress. however, k+ content was found to be significantly different between wt and pop2- <dig> mutant under both conditions . thus, whereas k+ content was significantly greater in pop2- <dig> than in wt under control conditions , pop2- <dig> exhibited a lesser k+ content after nacl treatment . nevertheless, the k+/na+ ratio of pop2- <dig> mutant after nacl treatment was not found to be significantly different from that of wt . to ascertain that the mutant was not impaired in k+ uptake and transport, we germinated wt and pop2- <dig> seedlings on agar nutrient medium with low k+ content  and noted that pop2- <dig> grew as well as did the wt under low k+ conditions . furthermore, the attempt to rescue pop2- <dig> phenotype on  <dig> mm nacl medium by adding  <dig> mm kcl was unsuccessful .

metabolic profiling of pop2- <dig> mutant reveals major changes in roots upon nacl treatment
metabolic disorders that might be induced by gaba-t activity impairment were investigated by profiling the major primary polar metabolites occurring in shoots and roots of wt and pop2- <dig> after  <dig> days of treatment with  <dig> mm nacl. a targeted analysis of gaba content in pop2- <dig> mutant and its wt was first performed and showed that mutant constitutively overaccumulated gaba under control conditions compared with wt, about 18-fold more in shoots and  <dig> -fold more in roots . under nacl conditions, gaba reached high levels in pop2- <dig> mutant, especially in roots where the gaba content was close to  <dig> μmoles.g- <dig> dw . principal component analysis was then performed in order to extract meaningful information from the whole dataset. thus, we were able to separate all conditions on the two first components , which were found to explain more than 66% of the dataset variability. wt and pop2- <dig> shoots metabolic profiles were shown to be very close under control conditions and also, to a lesser extent, under nacl conditions . in contrast, metabolic profile of pop2- <dig> roots was clearly different from that of wt, especially after nacl treatment as illustrated by the distance separating "roots pop2- <dig> nacl" cluster and "roots wt nacl" cluster . among the  <dig> metabolites determined,  <dig> were shown to be present in a significantly different amount in pop2- <dig> roots after nacl treatment . interestingly, most of those that were more abundant in the mutant after nacl treatment were amino acids while metabolites that were less abundant in the mutant were mostly carbohydrates . surprisingly, succinate was shown to be significantly more abundant in roots of pop2- <dig> after nacl treatment  although this compound could partly result from gaba degradation . other tca cycle intermediates , except 2-ketoglutarate which was more abundant in pop2- <dig> after nacl treatment , were not found to be present in a significantly different amount in roots of pop2- <dig> and wt  suggesting that tca cycle activity was not fundamentally compromised upon nacl stress in mutant roots. in shoots, metabolic disorders induced by nacl treatment seemed to be less severe since metabolite ratio between pop2- <dig> and wt were not so far different than under control conditions except for tryptophan and 2-ketoglutarate . unlike roots, shoots of pop2- <dig> mutant were shown to accumulate more fructose, sucrose and glucose after nacl treatment. surprisingly, gaba did not belong to the most discriminant metabolites between wt and pop2- <dig> .

pop <dig> expression pattern is reconfigured upon nacl treatment
ten-day-old homozygous transgenic plantlets harbouring ppop2::gus construct  were subjected to  <dig> mm nacl treatment for  <dig> days before gus staining. three independent lines were investigated and showed the same gus staining patterns but with different intensity. under control conditions, pop <dig> was mainly expressed in roots since no gus staining was visible in shoots  whereas a strong staining was present in roots . additionally, gus staining was present along primary and secondary roots except in the division zone of root apex . in salt-treated plants, gus staining was visible in expanded cotyledons and leaves . this induction of pop <dig> may be a response to na+ accumulation in shoots and suggests that the enhanced pop <dig> expression measured by qrt-pcr  was partly due to induction of the gene in shoots. gus staining pattern of nacl-treated roots seemed to be more complex. gus staining was indeed sharply reinforced in the terminal part of primary and secondary roots, especially in the central cylinder , while coloration disappeared in the central part of primary root .

discussion
gaba levels control upon nacl treatment involves transcriptional and biochemical events
the accumulation of gaba in response to nacl exposure is a common feature of plants as reported in alfalfa  <cit> , tomato  <cit>  and tobacco cells  <cit> . until today, the molecular and biochemical events at the origin of this accumulation were misunderstood. here, we showed in a. thaliana that gaba level changes under salt conditions were accompanied with variations of in vitro enzymes activities and transcription of gaba metabolism genes. overall, gaba metabolism was found to be activated by nacl treatment since almost all genes of this metabolism and both in vitro gad and gaba-t activities were up-regulated . these results basically implicate gaba metabolism in salt responses of a. thaliana and also suggest that metabolic flux through this metabolism is of importance under stressful conditions. however, the determination of in vitro gad and gaba-t activities failed to explain gaba level changes during the first days of nacl treatment. indeed, within the  <dig> first days, gad activity was not found to be significantly enhanced in salt-treated plantlets, even was decreased after  <dig> h of nacl exposure, while in the same time gaba level and gaba-t activity were found to be significantly increased. in this context, attention should be paid to the catalytic properties of plants gads that are known to be tightly regulated at the post-translational level by ca2+/calmodulin complex  <cit> . such post-translational regulation of gad activity should be responsible for the rapid accumulation of gaba observed in response to cold and wounding  <cit>  and is likely to explain the discrepancy observed between in vitro gad activity and gaba level evolutions given that nacl treatments are known to trigger rapid elevation of cytosolic ca2+ concentration  <cit> . thus, gaba accumulation in the first time of nacl exposure would mainly result from an activation of gad activity by ca2+ release in the cytosol; when stressful conditions are extended, gaba level control would implicate transcriptional regulation of gaba metabolism genes.

transcriptional profiling of gaba metabolism genes demonstrated that almost all genes involved in gaba metabolism whose expression was detectable were up-regulated in response to nacl . among the three gad genes whose expressions were detected, two paralogs were shown to be significantly up-regulated during nacl treatment . gad <dig> expression has been shown to be ubiquitous in plant organs and to vary depending on nitrogen nutrition of plant suggesting involvement of this isoform in nitrogen metabolism  <cit> . therefore, the increase of gad <dig> expression at high nacl concentration might be due to the necessity to adjust nitrogen metabolism under stressful conditions rather than to a specific response to nacl. unlike to gad <dig>  the putative gad <dig> isoform seemed to be nacl-specific since we showed that its expression increased in a dose-dependent manner . this isoform appears to be not only nacl-responsive but is also involved in a variety of abiotic stresses since gad <dig> was also shown to be induced in a. thaliana in response to hypoxia  <cit> , cold treatment  <cit>  and drought stress  <cit> . in addition, gad <dig> was found to be overexpressed in the aba-deficient nc3- <dig> mutant in comparison to wt under drought stress indicating that aba may be involved in the control of its expression  <cit> . analysis of gad <dig> expression pattern under stressful conditions may bring precious information on functions of the gene. in spite of the enhancement of two gad expressions, gad activity was shown to decrease after  <dig> h of treatment with  <dig> mm nacl. these results could be explained by  a time-delay between gad transcripts production and their translation,  the decrease of gad <dig> expression observed upon nacl treatment . the two genes involved in gaba catabolism  were also found to be up-regulated at moderate and high nacl concentrations . these data are consistent with a high importance of gaba catabolism upon nacl treatment and also mean that gaba-t and ssadh steps would be coordinated, probably to prevent accumulation of the reactive succinic semialdehyde  since both enzymes are located into the mitochondrion in a. thaliana  <cit> . we found that pop <dig> was the most highly expressed gene involved in gaba metabolism after  <dig> h of treatment with  <dig> mm nacl  and was induced both in shoots and some areas of roots upon nacl . taking into account that pop <dig> coding sequence is thought to be present as a single copy in arabidopsis genome  <cit> , its prominent expression level suggests a pivotal function of gaba-t in gaba accumulation upon nacl treatment. in parallel, a survey of public microarray databases reveals that pop <dig> is also responsive to osmotic stress , senescence  and aba treatment   <cit>  indicating an overall response of this step to environmental cues.

the pop2- <dig> mutant is oversensitive to nacl
to elucidate the contribution of the gaba-t to arabidopsis nacl responses, we performed a functional analysis of the arabidopsis pop <dig> gene. the first step of number of gene functional analysis is to check phenotype of the corresponding loss-of-function mutant. hence, we used the pop2- <dig> mutant which was initially isolated and characterized for its quasi-sterility  <cit> . recently, pop2- <dig> mutant has been reported to be resistant to e-2-hexenal  <cit>  and to accumulate a lesser amount of alanine in roots under hypoxia  <cit> . here, we demonstrated that root growth of pop2- <dig> mutant was oversensitive to ionic stress since both nacl and licl induced severe phenotype in mutant whereas mannitol did not . this oversensitivity was also monitored at the plant biomass level at a later developmental stage . it is noteworthy that pop2-overexpessing plants neither showed improved salt tolerance , even fed with  <dig> mm gaba , nor were found to exhibit special vegetative and reproductive phenotype .

we can ask whether high gaba levels that occur in pop2- <dig> mutant under control and even more under nacl conditions  could not be toxic. indeed, some data suggest that gaba overproduction is deleterious for plant development as shown in tobacco plants overexpressing a truncated gad that lacks auto-inhibitory calmodulin binding site   <cit> . however, since the gaba accumulation observed in these transgenic plants was also associated with a huge decrease of glutamate pool, authors did not conclude to a possible deleterious effect of gaba  <cit> . arguments in favour of a non-toxic effect of high gaba levels are found in the literature as reported by mirabella et al.  <cit>  who associated high gaba levels to resistance to e-2-hexenal in a. thaliana either in wild-type plants fed with exogenous gaba or in the constitutively gaba accumulating pop2/her <dig> mutants. moreover, ludewig et al.  <cit>  also ruled out the hypothesis of a higher oxidative stress induced by high gaba level in pop <dig> mutants since gaba accumulation was not shown to be associated with high reactive oxygen intermediates content. these findings are consistent with our observations indicating non-deleterious effects of  <dig> mm exogenous gaba on wt plantlets both under control and nacl conditions .

previous works showed that gaba seemed to have a tight link with na+ transport as shown in mammals where gaba is cotransported with na+ and cl-  <cit>  and in a. thaliana which was found to overaccumulate na+ when fed with gaba  <cit> . these observations led us to hypothesize that pop2- <dig> oversensitivity to nacl would be due to na+ and/or cl- overaccumulation. however, determination of na+ and cl- in plantlets subjected to nacl treatment did not reveal any difference between pop2- <dig> and its wt , thus invalidating our hypothesis. in contrast, k+ was found to be present in a significantly lesser amount in mutant compared with its wt after nacl treatment . this decrease may explain pop2- <dig> oversensitive phenotype in response to nacl since a similar, but more severe, behaviour has been observed in the mutant of the salt overly sensitive  <dig> locus  <cit> . nevertheless, the pop2- <dig> mutant was found to be able to grow on low k+ medium , while sos <dig> mutant did not, and the k+/na+ ratio in mutant was not shown to be different from that of wt . all these data suggest that k+ homeostasis in the mutant would not be so far disturbed. finally, armengaud and coworkers  <cit>  showed that under low k+, arabidopsis roots accumulated carbohydrates while organic acids content decreased. such metabolites evolutions are not similar to those observed in pop2- <dig> mutant  indicating that the mutant did not experiment k+ deficiency under nacl treatment.

gaba-t links n and c metabolisms in roots upon nacl treatment
recently, a significant effort has been done to elucidate metabolic functions of gaba in higher plants  <cit> . several evidences make sense with the idea that gaba metabolism in a. thaliana is highly active in roots, readily more than in shoots. first, we found that gaba was about 10-fold more abundant in roots than in shoots in wt plants under control conditions . this observation corroborates findings of miyashita and good  <cit>  in hydroponically grown arabidopsis plants. besides, in accordance with previous results obtained by qrt-pcr  <cit> , pop <dig> was shown to be mostly expressed in roots under control conditions  suggesting that gaba degradation occurred at a high rate in this organ. furthermore, gad <dig>  a root-specific gad responsible for the maintenance of gaba level in roots, has been characterized in arabidopsis  <cit>  whereas no shoot-specific isoform is to date identified. overall, these data lead us to assert that gaba metabolism would be of prime importance in roots.

the great inhibition of primary root growth triggered by nacl treatment in pop2- <dig> mutant was accompanied with substantial changes in roots metabolite profiles of mutant in comparison to wt, and these changes appeared to be more important in roots than in shoots as revealed by pca . these results argue in favour of a prominent metabolic function of gaba-t in roots under nacl conditions. this assertion is also consistent with the pop <dig> expression pattern which was found to be tightly reconfigured in nacl-treated roots . metabolic changes in pop2- <dig> mutant roots included accumulation of amino acids and decrease in carbohydrates  strongly suggesting a function for gaba-t, and in extenso for gaba metabolism, in the central c/n metabolism. several studies have reported the fluctuations of gaba content  <cit>  or the induction of gaba-tp encoding gene  <cit>  along day or senescence also indicating a function for gaba metabolism in c/n control. furthermore, fait et al.  <cit>  found positive correlation of gad and ssadh genes with several genes involved in central metabolism using the entire nasc <dig> matrix. overall, these findings give support to the fact that gaba plays a critical role in linking n and c metabolisms. intriguingly, tca cycle intermediates were not found to be present in a significant lesser amount in roots of pop2- <dig>  although gaba metabolism has been thought to play an anaplerotic function  <cit> . such a function is supported by recent studies that investigated plants impaired in tca cycle enzymes. in these experiments, gaba was often present at a differential level in enzyme impaired-plants indicating that gaba metabolism was regulated depending on tca cycle activity and/or integrity. these results concerned plants compromised in enzymes involved in steps both up  <cit>  and down  <cit>  to succinate production. the sharp decrease in carbohydrates content in pop2- <dig> roots upon nacl treatment may be due to the necessity to compensate gaba metabolism impairment by providing increased amount of pyruvate to tca cycle through glycolysis, which has been shown to be functionally associated with the mitochondrion  <cit> . we attempted to rescue pop2- <dig> phenotype by supplementing nacl enriched medium with either 2% sucrose or with the combination of  <dig> mm alanine and  <dig> mm succinate, but attempts failed  suggesting that metabolic impairment would not be the unique reason of pop2- <dig> phenotype.

in this context, we cannot exclude that a signaling effect of gaba would mediate pop2- <dig> oversensitivity. indeed, gaba has been thought to act as a signaling factor in plants  <cit> . it has been shown to regulate nitrate uptake in brassica napus  <cit>  suggesting a function in regulation of nitrogen metabolism. furthermore, gaba was found to down-regulate several 14-3- <dig> genes in a ca2+-, ethylene- and aba-dependent manner  <cit> . given that 14-3- <dig> are regulatory proteins involved in development, metabolism and stress responses  <cit>  and that gaba reached high levels upon nacl treatment in pop2- <dig> mutant , we can assume that these proteins would mediate metabolic changes recorded in the mutant.

CONCLUSIONS
investigation of gaba metabolism regulation upon nacl treatment at the metabolite, enzymatic activity and gene transcription levels brought new insights into its involvement in salt responses in a.thaliana. we provided evidences that gaba-t step was a key point of regulation of gaba metabolism under nacl treatment. functional analysis of the gaba-t encoding gene pop <dig> revealed that it constituted a determinant of salt tolerance since the loss-of-function pop2- <dig> mutant was shown to be oversensitive to ionic stress in spite of higher gaba levels in its tissues suggesting that gaba itself was not associated with tolerance. promoter-gene strategy and metabolite profiling data demonstrated that gaba-t was of prime importance in roots upon nacl, especially linking n and c metabolisms.
