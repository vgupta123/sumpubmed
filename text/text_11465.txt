BACKGROUND
group i introns belong to a family of rnas with catalytic activities. these ribozymes are mobile elements inserted within coding sequences of nuclear rdna, chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of some eukaryotes; and less frequently within coding sequences of eubacteria, phages and viruses. group i introns catalyze their own excision  from pre-mrna when mature rna is being processed. the exact site of intron excision and the perfect reestablishment of the interrupted message are defined by specific interactions between intron and exons, determined by a conserved secondary structure. group i introns fold on a structure, forming  <dig> conserved paired elements  with a conserved catalytic core .

size polymorphisms in group i introns have been described  <cit>  and are occasionally generated by the insertion of a mobile element such as homing endonuclease genes  in peripheral loops of intron paired elements p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> . homing endonuclease genes encode for site specific homing endonucleases , which in genetic crosses between an heg containing intron allele and an intronless allele, recognize the intron insertion site and catalyze a double strand break. the intronless allele is then repaired using the heg containing intron allele as a template. this mechanism of intron mobility is known as homing  <cit> . homing endonucleases are classified in five different families according to conserved protein motifs and functional and structural properties: laglidadg; giy-yig; h-n-h; his-cys box  <cit> ; and the recently described pd--xk motif  <cit> . his-cys box motifs are identified in he exclusively associated to nuclear group i introns  <cit> . homing endonucleases were described for fungi, protists, bacteria and viruses, but with unknown function for the hosts  <cit> .

descriptions of group i introns in rhodophyta are limited to a few genera  <cit> , although it is commonly reported for the genera porphyra and bangia   <cit> . a survey for group i introns presence in the order  described by müller et al.  <cit> , indicated that this order is a particularly rich in these introns. the use of introns as molecular markers at the intra-specific level is very limited  <cit> . usually in rhodophyta, analyses at the intra-specific level are addressed with molecular markers such as the nuclear rdna internal transcribed spacer   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> ; the plastidial spacer between the ribulose- <dig>  5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase large subunit  and the small subunit  genes   <cit> , and the mitochondrial spacer between the cytochrome oxidase subunit  <dig> and subunit  <dig> genes   <cit> .

in a previous work, oliveira and ragan  <cit>  characterized introns of different sizes inserted in the nuclear small subunit rrna gene  close to the 3' end  of three porphyra spiralis var. amplifolia  individuals collected at different sites on the southern brazilian coast. open reading frames  with his-cys box motifs were described inserted in the p <dig> paired element, confined within the conserved pair u*g, located in the ssu rdna exon and in the intron respectively in the complementary strand. this region is known as p1-extension  <cit> . these findings prompted us to: 1) characterize introns size polymorphisms at different psa populations on the eastern coast of south america; 2) infer genetic relationships and population structure of psa populations using introns in addition to rbcl-s and cox2- <dig> regions as genetic markers; and 3) verify if the different polymorphisms in peripheral loop of intron p <dig> paired element affected qualitatively introns excision, through an in vitro self-splicing assay.

RESULTS
characterization of introns size polymorphisms at different psa populations
group i s <dig> introns from  <dig> porphyra spiralis var. amplifolia  collected at eight different sites in the southern brazilian shore were pcr amplified. visualization in  <dig> % agarose gel unveiled four introns size polymorphism among different psa populations. the smallest introns were amplified from psa-v population  and the largest introns were amplified from psa-a, psa-i, psa-l and psa-t populations . intron size polymorphisms within a population were detected only for psa-s and psa-t collections. presence of two introns of different sizes occurring in the same sample was observed for one individual from psa-s  and for one individual from psa-t . based on these pcr results, introns from  <dig> individuals of psa-s, psa-t and psa-v were sequenced, and for the remaining populations, introns from two individuals per population were sequenced. sequencing data from individuals psa-b, psa-d and psa-r  <cit>  were obtained from the genbank. in total,  <dig> introns sequences were analyzed .

intron sizes in base pairs , homing endonuclease open reading frames  sizes in amino acids  and if the his-cys box motif is present are indicated; f/s indicates if frame shifts corrections are necessary for establishing the correct his-cys box reading frame. data obtained from:  <dig> oliveira and ragan  <cit> ,  <dig> haugen et al  <cit> .

introns size polymorphisms are due to insertions from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in intron p <dig> paired element. variability among the  <dig> psa sequences  yielded  <dig> different haplotypes , with haplotype diversity  of  <dig> . p1-extension is the most variable region presenting nucleotide substitutions and indels. when p1-extension was excluded from this comparison, only six different haplotypes were obtained with h =  <dig> , and the substitutions observed were limited to intron unpaired terminal loops . the neutrality tests results for introns without the p1-extension were all negative and significant , suggesting a rapid population expansion.

complementary strands of p1-extensions of the  <dig> haplotypes were translated in silico to amino acid sequences according to haugen et al.  <cit> . open reading frames from eight to  <dig> amino acids, were generated  and were blasted against other available proteins in genbank with blastp  <cit> . start codons for heg were found in all orfs, however when compared to others hes, premature stop codons or stop codon deletions were observed. his-cys box motifs, zinc binding sites and active sites were characterized on intron-coding complementary strands for six psa individuals from three different populations . for the remaining introns, his-cys box motifs, zinc binding sites and active sites were only verified when frame-shifts corrections were manually inserted in silico, or were absent. these results indicate that p1-extension of the  <dig> haplotypes are degenerated heg.

cox2- <dig> and rbcl-s analyses
cox2- <dig> region was pcr amplified and sequenced for five individuals of each population analyzed in this work . the amplified region has a total length of  <dig> bp for all individuals, being the cox2- <dig> spacer  <dig> bp long. variability among the  <dig> psa cox2- <dig> region sequences analyzed, yielded five different haplotypes . haplotypes differed from each other by one or two base-pairs , with h =  <dig> . similar to the results obtained for the intron analyses, the tajima's d values for cox2- <dig> were negative , but only marginally significant .

rbcl-s region was pcr amplified and sequenced for five individuals of populations psa-s, psa-t and psa-v, and for two individuals of the remaining populations. the region amplified is  <dig> bp long for all individuals, being the rbcl-s spacer  <dig> bp long. a single haplotype was obtained for all  <dig> analyzed individuals, with no divergence within and among populations .

genetic relationships and population structure of psa populations
to determine the genetic relationships among the studied psa populations, three median joining networks were constructed. the first one included intron + heg sequences , the second was performed with intron without heg sequence data , and the third was constructed with cox2- <dig> region sequences .

the network generated for intron + heg sequences shows three main clusters connected by median vectors, which represent missing intermediates, that is extant haplotype that was not sampled or an extinct ancestral haplotype  <cit> . the first cluster comprises introns with 1054- <dig> bp represented by haplotypes h <dig> to h <dig> and introns with  <dig> bp represented by haplotypes h <dig> and h <dig>  the most common haplotype in this cluster is h <dig>  which occurs in three geographically distant populations . haplotypes h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> present the intact his-cys box motif whereas haplotypes h <dig> and h <dig> present his-cys box only when frame shifts are inserted. haplotypes h <dig> and h <dig> present extensive deletions in the heg, but still have part of the his-cys box motif. the second cluster comprises exclusively 791- <dig> bp introns without his-cys box motif, represented by haplotypes h <dig> to h <dig>  the most common haplotype in this cluster is h <dig>  which is found in populations psa-g, psa- s and psa-t. the third cluster comprises the smaller introns  represented by haplotypes h <dig> to h <dig>  the most common haplotype in this cluster is h <dig>  which is from population psa-v. the intron + heg network shows a pattern of isolation by distance for psa populations.

the results for pairwise fst analyses of frequency of allele size polymorphisms are presented in table  <dig>  it was possible to note three distinct patterns of significant fst values, according to population geographic distribution. populations psa-a,psa-i and psa-l presented significant fst values when compared to populations psa-c, psa-g, psa-s and psa-t, and all of them presented significant fst values when compared to population psa-v. mantel's test results found significant correlation between fst values and geographic distance  corroborating the hypothesis of isolation by distance suggested by intron + heg network.

pairwise fst values of intron size polymorphisms of porphyra spiralis var. amplifolia populations . significant values are represented by the plus sign, and no significant values are represented by the minus sign .

the minimum spanning tree generated for intron without heg  and cox2- <dig> region sequences  exhibit a star-like topology. for intron without heg, the most frequent central haplotype occurred in  <dig> out of  <dig> collection sites . for cox2- <dig> region sequences, the majority of the individuals  possess the most frequent central haplotype. according to both networks topologies, a recent population expansion was detected for these markers.

self splicing assays
introns and exons flanking regions of one individual from populations psa-v , psa-g , psa-t  and psa-l  were cloned for in vitro transcription. pre-rna of the four individuals were incubated at 45°c for  <dig> min to verify the self-splicing reaction. the self-splicing reaction was observed, however just a part of the introns was spliced, while the other part remained attached to exons .

to confirm whether the exons were ligated, a rt-pcr reaction was performed with primers 1400f and 18s3' using the rna previously incubated in the conditions described above. the bands were excised from the gel and re-amplified with primers 1400f and 18s3' which anchors in the exons. the results of the re-amplification are shown in additional file  <dig>  amplicons were sequenced and the smaller bands were the joined 5' and 3' exons, presenting the reconstructed insertion site.

discussion
characterization of introns size polymorphisms at different psa populations
group i introns are well documented in the literature occurring in the red algal genera bangia and porphyra   <cit> . some of these group i introns present orfs of different sizes inserted in their p <dig> and p <dig> paired elements  <cit> . size variation in these orfs represents different stages of the heg cycle . goddard and burt  <cit>  postulated that the he coded by an intron recognizes the intron insertion site in an intronless population, invade it by lateral transfer and then it is vertically transmitted to the offspring. after being fixed with high frequencies in a population, the heg degenerates to a non-functional state, and then the intron and the heg tend to be lost. in this way, the intron recognition site is reestablished becoming available to be invaded again by an active heg-containing intron from the same species or from a closely related species, thus restarting the homing cycle.

in a previous work, oliveira and ragan  <cit>  characterized three size polymorphisms for group i introns from three psa individuals. in this work, two more sizes were characterized, in a total of five different sizes distributed in  <dig> psa populations along the brazilian coast. according to the cycle proposed by goddard and burt  <cit> , hegs can be found in three different character states: functional , nonfunctional  and absent . in psa populations analyzed in this work, we could only detect the nonfunctional state represented by heg degeneration, indicating that full length heg containing intron was once fixed for these populations. the different states of the intron + heg are not always found within natural populations, probably as a result of insufficient sampling  <cit> .

müller et al.  <cit>  evaluated if the cycle proposed by goddard and burt  <cit> , applied to group i introns present in the order bangiales. presence of introns containing degenerated hegs, presence of introns without heg and absence of introns, all these states scattered along individuals from different species, indicated that goddard & burt  <cit>  model is supported by intron + heg distribution in the order bangiales.

of the  <dig> introns sequences, only six presented the intact his-cys box motif. although these orfs did not present frameshifts mutation, they terminated prematurely relatively to the amino acid sequence for the homing endonuclease i-ppoi from the slime mould physarum polycephalum  <cit> , likewise porphyra fucicola and p. umbilicalis heg sequences  <cit> . as these sequences were not tested for endonuclease activity, they will be considered as heg pseudogenes, as suggested by müller et al.  <cit> .

cox2- <dig> and rbcl-s regions analyses
cox2- <dig> and rbcl-s regions were sequenced in addition to the ssu rdna introns, to infer genealogical relationships of psa populations. divergence among cox2- <dig> haplotypes of the  <dig> psa individuals sequenced ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. these values are in accordance to the divergence found among cox2- <dig> haplotypes from grateloupia doryphora  from north atlantic and north pacific  <cit> . however, they differ significantly when compared to the divergence among cox2- <dig> region from batrachospermum helminthosum individuals from north america,  <dig> % to  <dig> %  <cit>  and from acanthophora spicifera individuals from the hawaiian islands, where a single haplotype was observed  <cit> .

rbcl-s region has been employed in rhodophyta as a marker at the inter-specific, intra-specific and intra-population levels  <cit> , with levels of divergence of: 13% to18% for gracilaria species  <cit>  and  <dig> % to  <dig> % for individuals of the gymnogongrus complex  <cit> . however, a unique haplotype from all the sampled range  was determined for the rbcl-s sequences from  <dig> psa individuals.

population structure and genetic relationships of psa populations
genetic relationships of the  <dig> haplotypes  obtained from psa populations were accessed through network analyses. the network exhibit three main clusters suggesting a pattern of isolation by distance for the populations analyzed. the same grouping pattern was obtained for fst analysis. mantel's test corroborated the hypothesis indicated by the two previous analyses. therefore, isolation by distance appears to be the basic process accounting for structure in psa populations, manifested in a cline of heg degeneration. populations sampled at the southernmost end of the distribution present the entire his-cys box motif, while the population sampled at the northernmost end of the distribution, considering the start codon proposed by haugen et al.  <cit> , has only eight amino acids of the he. distributed between these two extremes, are the intermediate-sized alleles.

the neutrality tests results for the intron without heg indicated a fast population growth from an ancestor population with small effective number. at the same time, cox2- <dig> region results were marginally significant for the neutrality tests and rbcl-s region results showed no nucleotide variability. the low variability in these markers, also observed in the networks, is consistent with a demographic event of expansion from a population with low effective number affecting all loci. these results are not compatible to the heg length polymorphism. the intron + heg marker showed remarkable variation in length in the same individuals that presented few variations for the other markers. therefore, in the same window of time, much more variation was accumulated in heg than in sequence variation in the other three markers, which are probably under different selection constraints. considering the recent population expansion for psa along the brazilian coast, degeneration of heg was a very fast process. first, if we assume that a functional heg have a cost to the host cell, then natural selection will increase the frequency of nonfunctional elements; and second, if we assume that the heg was already fixed for psa populations , then the frequency of nonfunctional elements will increase due to low selection to keep a functional heg  <cit> .

based on these assumptions, two different scenarios can be proposed to explain intron +heg evolution in psa populations: in the first scenario, the horizontal transfer of intron + heg occurred in an ancestral individual, prior to the colonization of psa populations in the brazilian coast. therefore, it is reasonable to believe that the same bottleneck event that was detected by the three markers  probably had as a consequence the fixation in the population of the full length heg . if the largest introns are considered as the ancestral state, then the oldest populations are located in the southernmost end of the distribution, and as long as individuals migrate to the north, their hegs tend to degenerate. this scenario is consistent with the proposed hypothesis for intron insertion and evolution in the order bangiales based on phylogenetics analysis of ssu rdna and respective group i introns – intron horizontal transfer to an ancestor of the order bangiales, followed by vertical inheritance and evolution within the order as proposed by muller et al  <cit> .

in the second scenario, the ancestral psa individual lack intron + heg. it is possible to suggest that the horizontal transfer of intron + heg in psa ssu rdna occurred after the event of demographic expansion. in this case, the intron with the most degenerated heg – with more deletions accumulated – is present in the oldest population. this state was found in the northernmost population, suggesting a horizontal transfer event to have occurred in an individual from the psa-v population. after the horizontal transfer event, the functional heg invaded the other psa populations by gene flow, being the largest heg present in the more recently invaded populations, at the southernmost end of distribution. within the context of intron evolution in the order bangiales, this scenario is possible assuming the hypothesis that more than one intron insertion events has occurred during the divergence of the order  <cit> .

this is the first report addressing intron evolution focusing on only one species. understanding the mechanisms beyond intron + heg evolution has been a challenge, despite all the knowledge obtained for these elements.

self splicing assays
as self-splicing catalytic properties of group i introns are highly dependent on intron three-dimensional structure  <cit> , we verified whether the occurrence of insertions in p <dig> paired element alters intron catalytic activities, checking if introns sizes variants self-splice in vitro. one way to check for intron excision is the confirmation of exons ligation  <cit> .

the four intron size variants analyzed in this work self-spliced in vitro. therefore, the occurrence of different size polymorphisms in intron p <dig> paired element do not refrain intron self-splicing mechanism, although there is a hypothesis that the presence of heg may diminish self-splicing efficiency  <cit> . the loops are strategic localities for heg insertion. heg have been considered invasive mobile elements that remain neutral to the host when inserted into introns, becoming invisible to negative selection  <cit> . if group i introns lose their self-splicing capability due to the presence of a heg, they both would probably be eliminated from the gene they were inserted, since there is a strong selection against non-functional rdna genes.

CONCLUSIONS
commercial exploitation, mariculture and introduction of invasive species have been a major problem in the assignment of porphyra geographic origins. phenotypic plasticity along with a simple morphology is also an obstacle in porphyra identification. furthermore, scientific researches are more focused on taxonomy and phylogeny of the group than in population surveys. population structure of porphyra spiralis var. amplifolia could be assigned by heg degeneration, although not by cox2- <dig> and rbcl-s regions. therefore, intron size polymorphism is a suitable population marker for this species, and it can be rapidly detected using pcr assay.

the intron size polymorphism found in the psa populations, corroborate the heg cycle proposed by goddard & burt  <cit> , indicating that the degenerated hegs are reminiscent of the presence of a full-length and functional heg, once fixed for psa populations. the cline of heg degeneration detected for psa populations along the southern brazilian coast, determined the pattern of isolation by distance. analyses with the other markers indicated a demographic event of expansion for psa, from a population with low effective number. the maintenance of the heg apparently does not refrain the ability of the intron to self-splice even when the different degrees of degeneration of these elements are present.
