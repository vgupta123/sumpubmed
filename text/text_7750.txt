BACKGROUND
diarrhoeal disease is the second leading cause of infant mortality under the age of  <dig> worldwide  <cit> . enteropathogenic escherichia coli  is a human pathogen of the small intestine and is a significant cause of infantile diarrhea  <cit> . epec were recognized as pathogens several decades ago  <cit> . later on, epec and enteroaggregative e. coli  were distinguished from each other on the basis of their patterns of adherence to hep- <dig> cells. unlike the localised “microcolonyforming” pattern of adherence associated with epec, eaec display a characteristic aggregative or “stacked-brick” pattern of adherence  <cit> . nataro et al. demonstrated a significant association of eaec with diarrhea in a case control study of children in chile  <cit> . immediately following the discovery of eaec as a category of pathogenic e. coli, several epidemiological reports casted doubt on the pathogenic nature of eaec  <cit> . nevertheless, a volunteer study provided evidence for eaec strain  <dig> eliciting diarrhea in the majority of volunteers  <cit> . since then many studies have supported the association of eaec and diarrhea in both developing countries and industrialized nations. thus, eaec have been significantly associated with  endemic diarrhea in infants in developing and industrialised nations,  persistent diarrhea in hiv-positive patients,  traveller’s diarrhea,  food/ water-borne outbreaks, and  sporadic cases of diarrhea  <cit> . furthermore, the increasing number of reports in which eaec is implicated as the agent mediating diarrhea suggests that e. coli strains belonging to this pathotype are important emerging pathogens  <cit> . a large number of virulence factors has been associated with clinical illness in epidemiologic studies  <cit> . it is also remarkable that eaec strains are heterogeneous  <cit> . as not all strains of eaec tested elicited diarrhea, the eaec strain  <dig> which caused diarrhea in the volunteer study became the prototypical eaec strain for the study of virulence factors and eaec pathogenicity  <cit> . its genome has been sequenced  <cit>  and the virulence factors characterized.

success for a bacterial pathogen to cause disease requires not only the display of several virulence determinants, but also a precise control of their expression, such that each is expressed at the appropriate time and place in the host. a good example for that is expression of the salmonella pathogenicity island  <dig> . several environmental factors and regulators have been identified as affecting spi <dig>  <cit> . it has been shown that spi <dig> environmental regulation converges in the modulation of the hila gene  <cit> . hila is located on spi <dig> and encodes the hila protein, a member of the ompr/toxr family of regulators  <cit> . hila regulation itself is very complex and responds to several stimuli . both positive and negative regulators dictate appropriate hila levels, which, in turn, result in activation or repression of the spi-encoded effectors.

a genomic analysis of the type  <dig> secretion system  from e. coli showed that two different genomic islands encoded hila homologues  <cit> . the eip island, identified in the e. coli  <dig> genome encodes, in addition to different effectors, the eila gene, a hila-like regulator  <cit> . in addition, the ett <dig> pathogenicity island encodes the ygeh gene, which shows significant similarity to hila. this latter pathogenicity island also encodes a ttss and different effectors. remarkably, whereas ett <dig> appears to be functional in e. coli  <dig>  it has been subjected in the rest of the strains analysed to varying degrees of mutational attrition that results in a non-functional ttss.

the role of eila, the hila-homologue encoded in the genome of the enteroaggregative strain  <dig> was characterized a few years ago  <cit> . eila expression was reported to modulate expression of different genes of the eip island , as well as of two genes of a pathogenicity island not linked to eip . eila defect was associated to alterations in adherence to epithelial cells and to biofilm formation. a role for eila modulating expression of the ttss and effectors of different chromosomal islands in eaec was suggested. in contrast to eila, the regulatory role of ygeh has not been hitherto characterized. we study in this report ygeh. we show that it is able to compensate for hila depletion in salmonella. we also study its regulation, and describe some of its target genes in the ett <dig> pathogenicity island from strain  <dig>

to construct plasmids pbadeila, pbadygeh <dig>  pbadhila and pbadygeho <dig>  eila and ygeh genes of strain e. coli  <dig>  hila gene of s. typhimurium sl <dig> strain and ygeh gene from e. coli o157h <dig> were amplified using oligonucleotides eilakpni5-eilahindiii <dig>  ygehkpni5-ygehhindiii <dig>  hilabadfw-hilabadrv and ygeho157xbafw-ygeho157hindrv, respectively . the oligonucleotides add kpni and hindiii sites, to the eila and ygeh genes from e. coli  <dig>  ecori and xbai sites to the hila gene and xbai – hindiii sites to ygeh gene from e. coli o157:h <dig>  the corresponding kpni-hindiii, ecori-xbai and xbai-hindiii pcr fragments were cloned into pbad <dig> digested with the same enzymes, resulting in plasmids pbadeila, pbadygeh <dig>  pbadhila and pbadygeho <dig>  respectively.

genetic manipulations
standard molecular and genetic procedures were performed as described by  <cit> . enzymes were used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. introduction of plasmids into escherichia coli and s. typhimurium strains was performed by electroporation of 10% glycerol-washed cells using an eppendorf gene pulser . plasmids isolated from e. coli were first passaged through the restriction-deficient s. typhimurium strain lb <dig>  <cit>  before transformation of s. typhimurium sl <dig> competent cells.

chromosomal deletions of hila from s. typhimurium, hns, ihfa and ihfb from e. coli aag <dig> and ygeh and hns from e. coli  <dig> were obtained by the λ red recombinant method as previously described  <cit> . the antibiotic-resistance determinant of plasmid pkd <dig> was amplified using oligonucleotides hnsp1/hnsp <dig>  ygehp1/ygehp <dig> for hns and ygeh genes, and, in the case of hila, ihfa and ihfb deletions, the chloramphenicol resistance was amplified using as template the pkd <dig> plasmid and the oligonucleotides hilap1/hilap <dig> and ihfap1/ihfap <dig>  ihfbp1/ihfbp <dig> . mutants were selected on lb plates containing the appropriate selection marker, and the successful deletion of the gene was confirmed by pcr using the primers cat-c <dig> and cat-c <dig>  or kt and k <dig>  in combination with specific primers located in the remaining gene sequence nearby . when necessary, the antibiotic resistance was then eliminated by transforming the mutant strain with plasmid pcp <dig> and subsequent incubation at 43°c for two passages according to  <cit> . the double deletions were obtained by combining one previously deletion with other deletion associated with an antibiotic resistance.

chromosomal insertions of 3xflag sequences to the sipa and ygeh genes were obtained by a modification of the λ red recombinant method, as described by  <cit> . the antibiotic-resistance determinant of plasmid psub <dig> was amplified using oligonucleotides sipa3xp1/sipa3xp <dig> and ygeh3xp1/ygeh3xp <dig> for sipa and ygeh, respectively . mutants were selected on lb plates containing kanamycin, and successful 3xflag insertion was confirmed by pcr using the oligonucleotides kt and k <dig>  in combination with specific oligonucleotides located in the remaining gene sequence nearby . the sv5015sipa strain was used as a donor strain to transfer the sipa::3xflag fusion to strain sv5015hila using phage p <dig> ht  <cit> , generating strain sv5015sh. the chromosomal fusion ygeh::3xflag was constructed in the parental strain e. coli  <dig> and the isogenic mutant Δhns, generating 042ygeh3x and 042ygeh3xhns strains, respectively.

construction of an ygeh::lacz transcriptional fusion
a transcriptional ygeh::lacz fusion was constructed by cloning the promoter region of the ygeh gene from eaec  <dig> into the prs <dig> plasmid. a single copy of the fusion was then inserted into the chromosome of the aag <dig> strain by using the bacteriophage λrs <dig> as described by  <cit> . first of all, the promoter region of the ygeh gene was amplified using the oligonucleotides ygehbamhi5/ygehbamhi <dig>  that add a bamhi site, and the resulting pcr product was purified using the kit high pure pcr product purification kit . subsequently, the purified pcr product was digested with bamhi enzyme  and ligated into the bamhi-digested prs <dig>  generating the plasmid pygeh. the transcriptional fusion ygeh::lacz cloned into the plasmid pygeh was then transferred to the λrs <dig> bacteriophage according to  <cit>  and integrated as a single copy into the attb locus of the aag <dig> chromosome. to confirm the correct insertion from the selected resulting colonies, a pcr screening was performed according to  <cit> .

beta-galactosidase assay
β-galactosidase activity measurements were performed as described by  <cit> .

cell-free supernatant preparation
the supernatants from cultures were obtained utilizing trichloroacetic acid  as agent for protein precipitation and acetone for removal traces from tca treatment. the cultures were grown in lb medium until o.d.600nm at  <dig> , and then 10 ml were centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature. the supernatant was filtered with a  <dig>  μm pore size filter  and proteins were precipitated by adding tca at a final concentration of 10% and maintaining samples on ice for 1 hour. the samples were then centrifuged for 30 minutes at  <dig>  rpm at 4°c, the supernatants were discarded and  <dig>  ml of acetone was added. the samples were centrifuged once more as described above. after removal of acetone the pellet was air-dried for 10 minutes and the samples were reconstituted in sample buffer .

sds-page and western blotting
protein samples were analysed by sds-page at 10% and  <dig> %. proteins were transferred from the gels to pvdf membranes. western blot analysis was performed with monoclonal antibodies raised against flag-epitope  or against gapdh  and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg . detection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence using quantity one software .

rna isolation
total rna was extracted from bacteria using the rneasy mini kit  according to the manufacturer’s instruction. potential traces of dna were removed by digestion with dnase i , according to the manufacturer’s protocol. rna concentration and rna quality were measured using a nano- drop  <dig> .

real-time qrt-pcr
real-time quantitative reverse transcription-pcr  was performed as previously described  <cit> . briefly,  <dig> μg of total rna was reverse transcribed to generate cdna using the high-capacity cdna reverse transcription kit  as recommended by the manufacturer. as a control, parallel samples were run in which reverse transcriptase was omitted from the reaction mixture. oligonucleotides complementary to the genes of interest were designed using primer <dig> software. real-time pcr using sybr green pcr master mix  was carried out on the abi prism  <dig> sequence detection system . after analysis of amplification plots with the abi prism sds software package, relative quantification of gene transcription was performed using the comparative threshold cycle  method. the relative amount of target cdna was normalized using the gapa gene as an internal reference standard.

electrophoretic mobility shift assay 
for emsa, a 228 bp fragment corresponding to the promoter region of the ygeh operon  was amplified using oligonucleotides ygehbamhi5/ygehbamhi <dig> . for each reaction, 50 ng dna were mixed with increasing concentrations of the purified h-ns-his protein in binding buffer . after incubation for 30 min at room temperature, 20 μl of samples were separated on 5% polyacrylamide/ <dig> × tbe gel. the bands were stained using ethidium bromide and visualized using quantity one software . for competitive emsa, the fragment corresponding to the ygeh promoter region dna  was mixed with a  <dig> fold excess of competitor dna  in a final volume of 20 μl, using the same binding buffer as described above. increasing concentrations of h-ns–his were added as indicated, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. the samples were resolved, stained and visualized as described above. purified h-ns–his protein was obtained as described  <cit> , and the hlyr dna was obtained as described by  <cit> .

RESULTS
the invasion gene regulator coded by ygeh shares significant homology to eila and hila proteins
the complete genome sequence of e. coli  <dig> strain has led to the identification of two open reading frames encoding two proteins eila  and ygeh  that exhibit similarity with the s. typhimurium hila protein . in addition to the already reported eila regulator  <cit> , the putative invasion gene regulator ygeh shows a significant degree of conservation . whereas eila appears to be restricted to e. coli  <dig> and other enteroaggregative strains, ygeh is also present in other e. coli strains, such as k <dig>  enterohemorrhagic o157:h <dig>  enteroaggregative hemorrhagic o104:h <dig> and others  <cit> . in spite of the significant degree of identity at the amino acid level between hila and ygeh, no information is available about its biological activity, neither regulatory role nor its targets. thus, we decided to further characterize this latter protein from strain  <dig> figure  <dig>

eila and ygeh proteins from e. coli strain  <dig> complement the hila− phenotype in s. typhimurim strain sv5015
we addressed first the question whether the ygeh proteins from strain  <dig>  and from strain o <dig>  could be functionally equivalent to hila. to test this, we first constructed a Δhila mutant of s. typhimurium strain sv <dig> . to monitor hila activity we tested the expression of the sipa gene. the sipa gene is encoded in the sic/sip operon. the sipa effector is secreted by the type iii secretion system encoded in the salmonella pathogenicity island  <dig> . expression and translocation of sipa requires hila activation of spi <dig> operons  <cit> . to detect sipa, a 3xflag was fused to its c-terminal end. for the complementation studies, eila and ygeh genes from strain  <dig> and the ygeh gene from strain o <dig> were cloned in the expression vector pbad <dig>  <cit> . wild-type sv5015sipa  and its Δhila derivative  were transformed with plasmids pbad <dig>  pbadhila, pabdeila, pbadygeh <dig> and pbadygeho <dig>  cultures of the different transformants were grown in lb medium containing carbenicillin. proteins present in the corresponding supernatants were analyzed by sds-page and coomassie brilliant blue staining . moreover sipa::3xflag was immunodetected with anti-flag specific antibodies. as expected, sipa protein could only be detected in wt strain sv <dig> sipa::3xflag, but not in the corresponding Δhila derivative . alternatively, cultures of these strains were grown in lb medium containing carbenicillin and  <dig> % arabinose. overexpression of eila, ygeh <dig>  and ygeho <dig> upon arabinose induction was confirmed by qrt-pcr. upon arabinose inducing conditions, plasmids pbadhila, pbadeila, and pbadygeh <dig> complemented in trans the Δhila mutation . interestingly, plasmid pbadygeho <dig> does not complement Δhila. the amount of expressed sipa::3xflag was very similar in strains harbouring either pbadhila, pbadeila or pbadygeh. other effector proteins could also be detected in cells expressing any of the three hila-like modulators . these results provide evidence for e. coli strain  <dig> eila or ygeh proteins being able to functionally replace hila in salmonella, but not for ygeho <dig>  it is noteworthy that, compared to ygeh <dig>  ygeho <dig> presents  <dig> amino acid substitutions, that might result in loss of protein function .figure  <dig>

eila and ygeh <dig> activate sipa expression via invf in salmonella
the regulatory cascade leading to sipa expression requires hila-mediated activation of invf which, in turn, activates sipa  <cit> . to check if either eila or ygeh <dig> would influence sipa expression by activating invf, strain sv <dig>  was used. a Δhila derivative was constructed by transducing the Δhila::cm allele from strain mh-c <dig>  strain sv <dig> was transformed with plasmid pbad <dig>  and strain sv5258hila was transformed with plasmids pabd <dig>  pbadhila, pbadeila and pbadygeh <dig>  the corresponding transformants were grown at 37°c to the beginning of the stationary phase  either in lb medium or in lb medium containing  <dig> % arabinose. as expected, neither arabinose nor the vector pbad <dig> affected invf expression in the hila+ strain . in contrast, in Δhila mutant strain, the presence of plasmids pbadhila, pbadeila or pbadygeh <dig> drastically increased invf transcription when cells were grown in lb medium containing arabinose . hence, the effect of both eila and ygeh <dig> influencing invf transcription is similar to that of hila.figure  <dig>

expression. transcription of invf in strains sv <dig> and sv5258hila was evaluated by measuring β-galactosidase activity in the different constructs. samples were obtained from lb cb <dig> or lb cb <dig> l-arabinose  <dig> % cultures at the beginning of stationary phase  at 37°c. standard errors from three independent experiments are shown.



regulation of ygeh <dig> expression
we recently shed light on the role of the nucleoid-associated proteins h-ns and hha modulating hila expression in salmonella in a temperature-and growth phase-dependent manner. ihf appeared to antagonize h-ns-mediated repression of hila when cells reach the stationary phase of growth  <cit> . we decided to study the growth conditions influencing ygeh <dig> expression and the hypothetical role of the global modulator h-ns on ygeh <dig> expression. we tried to construct a transcriptional ygeh::lacz gene fusion in the chromosome of strain  <dig>  under our working conditions, it was not possible to obtain this fusion in the  <dig> chromosome. we therefore decided to construct it in strain aag <dig> . expression studies were performed in wt cells and in cells lacking the modulators h-ns and/or ihf at varying temperatures and osmolarities, in exponentially growing cells as well as in cells entering the stationary phase. the most relevant regulatory transcriptional data obtained in strain aag <dig> were thereafter validated in strain  <dig> by detecting ygeh::3xflag by qrt-pcr and western blotting, as well .

the expression profile of ygeh <dig> in different culture condition shows that stationary growth phase influences its expression, moderately increasing it. no effects of growth temperature or osmolarity are apparent . with respect to the modulators h-ns and ihf, h-ns significantly represses ygeh <dig> expression in the different conditions tested, including the onset of the stationary phase. ihf appears to be required for a proper expression of ygeh <dig>  the fact that deletion of either ihfa or ihfb only decreases ygeh <dig> expression when the h-ns protein is available, suggest that, in the ygeh <dig> regulatory region, ihf might antagonize h-ns .figure  <dig>

to confirm that the observed regulatory effect of h-ns on ygeh <dig> expression in strain agg <dig> also takes place in strain  <dig>  ygeh <dig> transcription was detected in strains  <dig> and 042Δhns by both real-time qrt-pcr and ygeh protein immunodetection. qrt-pcr shows an upregulation in the Δhns mutant of the + <dig>  ±  <dig>  compared to wt strain. to detect ygeh <dig>  3xflag was fused to its c-terminal end. the ygeh::3xflag was immunodectected by using the monoclonal anti-flag antibody. as expected from the results obtained in strain aag <dig>  expression of ygeh <dig> increased in the absence of h-ns .figure  <dig>

we studied next if h-ns binds with specificity to ygeh <dig> regulatory region. a virtual footprinting analysis of this region showed that it includes three putative sequences, predicted to be h-ns binding sites . a 228 bp dna fragment that includes the ygeh <dig> promoter region was used for emsa assays. according to the transcriptional data, binding of h-ns could be shown for the selected dna fragment . to provide evidence for specificity of binding, a competitive band shift experiment was performed, using both the fragment corresponding to the ygeh <dig> regulatory region, and a dna fragment, corresponding to the regulatory region of the hly operon . h-ns does not show specific binding to this fragment  <cit> . the competitive band shift assay showed that h-ns preferentially binds to the ygeh <dig> regulatory region .figure  <dig>

ygeh upregulates ett <dig> determinants
taking into account that ygeh is encoded in the ett <dig> island, we decided to test the effect of ygeh depletion on expression of different ett <dig> encoded genes. genes selected corresponded to most of the ett2-encoded operons, and were the eivf gene, encoding an invf-like protein, eiva, etra, eprh, ygeg, ygek and yqei . expression of these genes was first monitored by qrt-pcr in the wt  <dig> strain and in the ygeh <dig> single mutant. as expected from ygeh being a transcriptional activator, depletion of ygeh resulted in downregulation of the different ett <dig> genes . taking into account that ygeh expression is increased in an hns mutant, we decided to further investigate whether, as a response to reduced h-ns levels, ett <dig> genes are also upregulated in a ∆hns mutant. as expected, all the ett <dig> genes tested are upregulated in strain  <dig> Δhns . hence, expression of ett <dig> genetic determinants is subjected to h-ns-mediated repression via ygeh.figure  <dig>

discussion
in this report we provide evidence for the close relationship between the e. coli  <dig> ygeh protein, the eila regulator and the salmonella regulator hila. genomic studies have shown that the ett <dig> island is widespread in escherichia and shigella strains  <cit> , although in many of them the gene cluster is either disrupted or incomplete  <cit> . the ygeh protein, which shares significant similarity to the spi <dig> modulator hila, is present in several of the strains analyzed as, for instance,  <dig>  o157:h <dig> or mg <dig>  we show here that the ygeh protein is functional in strain  <dig>  furthermore, the ygeh protein, as well as the already characterized eila protein, is able to complement the ∆hila mutation in salmonella. all of them target the spi <dig> gene invf which, in turn, activates the expression of effectors such as sipa. these results support the close functional and structural relationship between these proteins and suggest a common origin. remarkably, whereas either ygeh <dig> or eila complement the hila mutation, ygeho <dig> does not. the amino acid sequence of ygeh <dig> and of ygeho <dig> differs in several amino acid residues, and these differences may be underlying loss of protein function.

unlike eila gene  <cit> , ygeh is expressed when  <dig> cells grow in lb medium. unlike hila, significant expression levels are detected both at the exponential and stationary growth phases. only a moderate increase in transcription is apparent at the onset of the stationary phase. when growing in lb medium, neither temperature nor osmolarity are critical factors altering ygeh <dig> expression. remarkably, h-ns appears as a repressor of ygeh <dig> expression. under all growth conditions tested, the hns mutant from strain  <dig> showed an upregulated expression of ygeh. whereas these data show that h-ns is a repressor of ygeh <dig>  it is also apparent that environmental conditions leading to a full induction of ygeh <dig>  are not among those used in this work. h-ns targeting ygeh <dig> is also supported by the emsa assays in the presence of a dna fragment including the ygeh regulatory region and a competitor dna molecule. altogether, these data show that, when coping with the appropriate environmental conditions,  <dig> cells must be able to significantly increase ygeh levels by counteracting h-ns silencing.

a question to be addressed is the biological role of the either complete or incomplete ett <dig> determinants in different e. coli isolates, ranging from mg <dig> to o157:h <dig>  some previous data together with the results presented in this paper may help to clarify this. in a previous report  <cit> , ygeh, etra and eivf genes from the ett <dig> genetic element from e. coli o157:h <dig> were mutagenized, and the effect of the corresponding mutant alleles on expression of the lee  pathogenicity island was studied. whereas disruption of the ygeho <dig> gene did not influence lee expression , the etra and eivf mutant alleles were found to significantly enhance secretion of proteins encoded by the lee. transcription of several lee genes was altered in these mutants. we show in this report that, unlike ygeh <dig>  ygeho <dig> fails to complement the Δhila mutation. the production of a non-functional ygeh protein in e. coli strain o <dig> may be underlying the fact that, whereas etra and eivf mutants of strain o <dig> influence lee expression, ygeh mutants do not  <cit> . hence, mutational attrition that occurs in some genomic islands may also affect some of the encoded modulators, thus resulting in a complex array of functional and non-functional genes that may significantly increase the genomic plasticity of those strains that incorporate the corresponding genomic islands.

CONCLUSIONS
ygeh and eila proteins can functionally replace hila in salmonella. e. coli  <dig> ygeh protein expression is similar when cells grow in a wide variety of lab culture conditions. whereas ygeh expression upregulates expression of ett <dig> genes, h-ns downregulates their expression. as exemplified by ygeho <dig> protein, some of the ygeh modulators encoded in ett <dig> islands may be non-functional. hence, mutational attrition identified in the ett <dig> cluster is not restricted to ygeh-modulated genes, but may also affect the modulator itself.
