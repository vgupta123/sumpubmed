BACKGROUND
the rapid development of next-generation sequencing technologies has resulted in a fruitful decade of genomic discoveries, many of which are becoming integrated into translational settings and promise to dramatically improve clinical outcomes  <cit> . despite the tremendous reduction in sequencing costs and increase in data generation throughput, projects that require interrogating more than a few hundred human genomes can still be costly. efforts that explored a “low coverage” sequencing strategy, such as the  <dig> genomes project  <cit>  and the charge project  <cit> , sequenced thousands of human subjects at 4–10x read depth of coverage each. these projects have been very successful by leveraging informatics algorithms and imputation methods to achieve variant discoveries with exceedingly high quality and sensitivity  <cit> . in addition, several studies have demonstrated that genotype likelihood and read information from low-coverage sequencing can be directly used for population genetics analyses, without genotype calling .

we aim to continue these developments and hypothesize that a study design of sequencing at population scale  with each subject at 1–2x coverage  would capture sufficient information to understand population genomic attributes such as diversity, population substructure, and admixture. such a study design would decrease the cost for a population genomics study to tens of thousands of dollars. this design has broad utility for both population genomics studies in various model species  <cit>  and disease genetics studies  <cit> . for example, while projects such as the  <dig> genomes project and the hapmap project  <cit>  surveyed a number of populations to generate a large resource of reference panels, populations or ethnicities that have large genetic distances from these sample panels have poor imputation power using these standard reference panels  <cit> . an extremely low coverage, population-level wgs surveys would provide additional information for these populations.

south asian populations are an example of major populations that lack adequate reference panels. south asian populations on the indian subcontinent are known to have a complex demographic history with multiple socio-linguistic groups  <cit> . there is also evidence of founder effect  <cit>  and a long history of endogamy along caste and tribal lines  <cit> , making south asian populations among the most diverse populations with unique disease profiles  <cit> . association studies among south asians, using generic genotyping arrays and reference panels for interrogation and imputation, could fail to identify associated loci specific to these populations due to their unique genetic variants and haplotypes. many south asian populations sequenced in previous studies  <cit> , including the  <dig> genomes project, were migrant populations and captured only a limited amount of the genetic variation and haplotype diversity present in the indian subcontinent. our proposed strategy holds potential for surveying various south asian populations to catalogue new genetic variation at an affordable cost.

as a proof-of-principle, we present the results from extremely low coverage whole genome sequencing  of eight south asian populations from a wide spectrum of social and cultural strata living in the state of andhra pradesh. the population samples belong to four broad self-identified classifications: lower caste, middle caste, upper caste and tribe. using exl-wgs of  <dig> samples with coverages between 1x and 2x, we demonstrate that the exl-wgs study design generates accurate genomic variant information and reliably recapitulates population substructure generated by previous methods. moreover, sequencing approaches provide an advantage for population studies compared to genotyping array platforms, which are known to have substantial ascertainment bias  <cit> . furthermore, we show that the genotypes from exl-wgs can serve as a customized reference panel, adding more power to association studies than existing genomic data  <cit> .

RESULTS
samples and sequencing coverage
we sequenced  <dig> samples from the state of andhra pradesh to an average read depth of coverage of  <dig> x  . we refer to our dataset as sas-ap . the cohort consists of eight populations across four social strata . on average, ~65%  7%) and ~38%  of the genome is covered by at least one read or two reads, respectively. at  <dig> x coverage,  <dig> and 47% of the genome is predicted to be covered by at least one read and two reads, respectively, based on the lander-waterman statistics  <cit>  . our result is comparable to the expectation.table  <dig> sequencing and variant calling statistics for sas-ap samples







only snvs with minor allele frequency  ≥10% are included. total snvs: the total number of snvs in a population. avg snvs: the average number of snvs in an individual. ti/tv: transition/transversion snv ratio. novel 1000g-sas: the number of snvs that are not in the 1000g-sas dataset. novel dbsnp 141: the number of snvs that are not in dbsnp  <dig>  acaste populations




variants discovery
to test the feasibility of an exl-wgs sequencing design for variant identification, we first simulated a cohort of  <dig> samples from the african populations in the  <dig> genomes phase  <dig> data ). the coverages in the simulated dataset closely matched that of the sas-ap dataset . when the variance ratio statistic parameter  is set at  <dig> , snptools  <cit>  recovered all single nucleotide variants  with minor allele frequency  ≥ 10%. the false discovery rate was bounded by 3%, where the majority of false positive sites had a maf < 10%. the average individual genotype discordance rate for snvs with maf ≥ 10% was  <dig> % . this result demonstrates that snptools has good accuracy in calling snvs with maf ≥ 10% using exl-wgs data. therefore, we identified snvs in the sas-ap dataset using snptools with s =  <dig>  as determined in the simulation study .

to further improve the variant calling quality, we used a second variant calling tool, the genome analysis tool kit   <cit> , for variant identification. using the same simulation strategy, we generated a new set of simulated samples from the same  <dig> african samples on chromosome  <dig> and evaluated the performance of snptools and gatk, as well as the consensus of the two call sets. for sites with maf ≥ 10% in the  <dig> genomes dataset, snptools call set has a sensitivity of  <dig> % and a fdr of  <dig> %. gatk called  <dig>  variants with maf ≥ 10%, with a sensitivity of  <dig> % and a fdr of  <dig> %. the consensus of the two pipelines yielded a recall rate of  <dig> %, while reducing the fdr to ~13% . because the consensus call set improves the fdr with only a small reduction in sensitivity, we called variants in sas-ap data using the same approach and autosomal biallelic snvs with maf ≥ 10% were selected as our final call set and used for all subsequent population genetics analyses.

the final call set included  <dig> , <dig> autosomal biallelic snvs with a transition/transversion ratio of  <dig> . of these,  <dig>   are novel with respect to the south asian dataset in the  <dig> genomes project phase  <dig> , and ~ <dig> snvs are absent in dbsnp build  <dig>  the vast majority of the snv sites have an average coverage between  <dig> x and 4x, close to our average sequencing depth of  <dig> x . the number of snvs in each sample ranges from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig>  with an average of  <dig> , <dig>  .

to assess the quality of the exl-wgs call set, we compared the exl-wgs calls to single nucleotide polymorphism  genotyping array genotype calls and sanger sequencing results from previous studies  <cit> . for  <dig> of the samples that were previously genotyped using snp arrays  <cit> ,  <dig> % of the snvs were recovered by exl-wgs dataset. in another study,  <dig> samples in this study were sequenced for a  <dig> kb encode region on chromosome  <dig> with sanger sequencing  <cit>  . within the  <dig> kb region,  <dig> % of the snvs were rediscovered by exl-wgs dataset . among the  <dig> heterozygous calls in the encode dataset,  <dig>  were correctly called by sas-ap dataset . in particular, we achieve high genotyping accuracy  even for heterozygous sites that have no coverage in an individual.

population genetic analyses
next we assessed if the exl-wgs provides sufficient information for examining population structure in sas-ap samples. first, simulation experiments were carried out by thinning the reads from the  <dig> genomes dataset to test the feasibility of performing principal component analysis  on common snvs in an exl-wgs cohort . pca was carried out on four simulated datasets with coverages of  <dig> x,  <dig> x,  <dig> x and 1x, respectively . simulation results suggest that snvs with maf > 20% are sufficient to detect population structure by pca in all four call sets.

using sas-ap variant calls with maf ≥ 10%, we examined the relationship among the populations/groups in our dataset. pca of sas-ap samples with the  <dig> genomes project phase  <dig> european , east asian  and south asian  samples showed that our samples are most closely related to the 1000gp3-sas samples, as expected . the khonda dora samples cluster separately from all other south asian samples on principal component  <dig>  and are the closest to 1000gp3-eas samples among south asian samples . when the  <dig> genomes project phase  <dig> african and american samples are included, the sas-ap samples still clustered with 1000gp3-sas samples . consistent with the pca result, fst statistics place sas-ap closest to 1000gp3-sas. except for khonda dora, all other populations are closer to 1000gp3-eur than 1000gp3-eas . the 1000gp3-afr populations have the largest distance with all sas-ap populations, which is consistent with the out-of-africa expansion model.fig.  <dig> pca of sas-ap and 1000gp <dig> samples. each symbol represents one individual. pc <dig> and pc <dig> are shown on the x and y axis, respectively. the percentage of variance explained by each pc is labeled on the axis. the map shown in the figure is adapted from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:world_map_blank_without_borders.svg where permission is granted under a creative commons license




to further examine fine-scale population structure within our samples, we performed pca on sas-ap samples only . the two tribal groups, irula and khonda dora, are clearly separated from the caste groups on pc <dig> and pc <dig>  respectively. consistent with this result, irula has the highest pairwise fst with all other sas-ap group, followed closely by khonda dora, except for brahmins, who have a higher fst with khonda dora than irula . the mean pairwise fst of populations in sas-ap is  <dig>  . this value is higher than those of other populations sampled across the indian subcontinent . pca that includes the 1000gp3-sas samples also shows distinctive clustering of khonda dora and irula tribal samples separated from the caste samples . while the non-tribal populations are not as clearly differentiated as the tribal groups, there is evidence of clustering along caste-based lines. when pca is performed on caste samples only , lower caste samples cluster separately from 1000gp3-gih , 1000gp3-pjl , and brahmins on pc <dig>  lower caste samples are also mostly separate from 1000gp3-beb , 1000gp3-itu  and 1000gp3-stu  samples . middle caste yadava and kapu samples are indistinguishable from the 1000gp3-beb, itu and stu samples but can be distinguished based on pc <dig> values from the lower caste, upper caste, 1000gp3-gih, and 1000gp3-pjl samples. the upper caste brahmin samples are differentiated from lower caste and tribal samples in all pca plots and are the closest to 1000gp3-pjl and 1000gp3-gih samples. this is consistent with previous research suggesting a larger west eurasian genetic component in upper castes compared to other castes  <cit> .fig.  <dig> pca of south asian samples. a all sas-ap samples; b sas-ap excluding khonda dora and irula samples; c sas-ap and 1000gp3-sas samples; d sas-ap and 1000gp3-sas excluding khonda dora and irula samples. each symbol represents one individual. pc <dig> and pc <dig> are shown on the x and y axis, respectively. the variance explained by each pc is labeled on the axis




next, we examined the composition of potential ancestral components in sas-ap and 1000gp <dig> samples using the admixture program  <cit>  . at k =  <dig>  four ancestral components corresponding to africa, europe, india, and east asia were identified . at k =  <dig>  the five ancestral components corresponded to the major continental groups: africa, europe, india, east asia, and america . at k =  <dig>  two groups within india were identified: one is predominantly represented in the 1000gp <dig> samples, and one in the sas-ap samples . previously studies have also identified two similar main ancestral groups in india and termed them “ancestral north indians”  and “ancestral south indians”   <cit> . most of our sas-ap samples contain an admixture of ani and asi components, with the majority of the predicted ancestry from asi. interestingly, compared to the caste groups, the two tribal groups showed distinct ancestry: irula samples are dominated by the asi component while khonda dora samples have a distinctively large  east asian ancestral component compared to other sas-ap samples. it is also notable that at k =  <dig>  the 1000gp <dig> finnish population has more asian and american-like components than do other europeans. this might be explained by finnish origins: many finns are thought to have ancestry from southeastern europe and share ancestral components with asian/american people  <cit> . at k =  <dig>  an ancestral group that is dominant in irula samples is recognized .fig.  <dig> admixture analysis of sas-ap and 1000gp <dig> samples. a k = 5; b k =  <dig>  each vertical bar represents one sample. the vertical bar is composed of colored sections, where each section represents the proportion of a sample’s ancestry derived from one of k ancestral populations




several recent studies have proposed to directly use genotype likelihood  from low-coverage sequencing for population genetics analyses, without genotype calling . for sites covered by sequencing reads, using gl before calling genotype should maintain more information for population genetics analysis. we compared the population genetic analysis results for genotype-based analyses with gl-based analyses . the pca, admixture, and fst results for the two types of analyses showed similar results in general. the gl-based pca showed a tighter clustering of the samples than the genotype-based pca but the overall pattern and the amount of variance explained are similar between the two plots . this observation is consistent with the original study where genotype-based pca using common variants are similar to gl-based pca  <cit> .

imputation performance
the exl-wgs study design can be a highly effective and affordable strategy to generate population-specific imputation reference panels, which can improve imputation accuracy in association studies that use snp arrays as primary data sources. using a simulation dataset, we showed exl-wgs imputation reference panel has a comparable performance to the snp array reference panel within the same population . however, when the population of interest has a large genetic distance from the available reference panels, exl-wgs could provide a better imputation panel than a generic reference panel. to test this hypothesis, we examined whether imputation accuracy can be improved by creating a population-specific reference panel using sas-ap samples than using the  <dig> genomes south asian reference panel. the weighted fst estimates between populations in sas-ap and 1000gp3-sas is maximum for tribal populations at approximately  <dig> .

for the imputation experiment, approximately one-third of the samples from each of the main caste and tribal classifications from sas-ap were chosen as a target set for imputation. the remaining samples from sas-ap were used as a representative exl-wgs population-specific reference panel, and  <dig> randomly selected 1000gp3-sas samples were used as the generic reference panel. approximately 5% of sites were removed from the target set  and the performances of the two reference panels are compared. for snvs removed in the target site, the custom sas-ap reference panel had a higher dosage correlation coefficient  value than the 1000gp <dig> panel for all population classifications . the r <dig> is most pronounced  in the tribal population and least apparent for the lower caste . all the missing snvs were recovered using both the reference panels. given the high genetic diversity in the indian subcontinent, and the unique ancestry profiles of populations, using a custom reference panel will be better than using any of the existing populations, even for snvs in the maf range ≥ 10%.fig.  <dig> imputation dosage correlation coefficient r <dig> of ~ <dig>  missing sites from sas-ap samples. results from the sas-ap reference panel and the 1000gp3-sas reference panel are shown in blue and red bars, respectively. the number of target samples is given in parenthesis




to determine if the better performance of the sas-ap reference panel is due to the batch effect between the  <dig> genomes and the sas-ap samples, or due to population composition, we further evaluated the performance of the reference panels for imputing the  <dig> genomes itu samples as the target . imputation results from different  <dig> genomes indian samples suggest the reference panel population composition has a considerable effect on the reference panel performance. for example, the  <dig> genomes reference panel from itu samples outperformed sas-ap samples for itu sample imputation, as expected . however, sas-ap panel performed as well as the reference panel from the  <dig> genomes gih, pjl, and beb samples . this result highlights the need of an extensive sampling of indian populations.

mitochondrial genome
because of the high copy number of mitochondrial dna, exl-wgs should yield higher coverage for the mitochondrial genome than for the single-copy nuclear genome. to test this hypothesis, we determined the depth of coverage for the  <dig> mitochondrial genomes . all nucleotide bases in all samples were covered by at least one read, and on average,  <dig> % percent of bases had >10x coverage. mean depth of coverage ranged from 57x to 266x, with an average coverage of 124x for all samples.

using the exl-wgs data, we generated a high-quality mitochondrial genome sequence for each sample. to further assess the exl-wgs quality, we generated mtdna sequence data for sample i <dig> and kd <dig> on an ion torrent pgm and compared the results to the illumina exl-wgs data. for both samples, all base calls between the pgm and exl-wgs were in agreement except for one difference in i <dig> at position  <dig>  and four single c base addition in kd <dig>  all four additions in kd <dig> are within homopolymeric c regions. these differences are likely attributable to the well-known difficulties in sequencing homopolymeric regions on the ion torrent platform. additionally, no differences were found between the exl-wgs data and lineage-defining snvs genotyped previously in a subset of the  <dig> samples using single-base extension genotyping  <cit> . taken together, these results demonstrate that exl-wgs produces high-quality complete mitochondrial genome sequence data.

next, we determined the mtdna haplogroup distribution among sas-ap samples using mitochondrial whole-genome sequences. samples were grouped into populations based on their caste or tribe affiliation, and the proportion of each major mtdna lineage was calculated for each population . mitochondrial haplogroup m is the predominant lineage in all populations. a greater proportion of r, u, and h/hv occur in caste than in tribal populations. caste populations, with the exception of relli, have at least 30% non-m lineages. in contrast, non-m lineages were not observed in irula, an isolated tribal group from southern andhra pradesh. similarly, only one major non-m lineage  was seen in khonda dora, an isolated tribe from northeastern andhra pradesh. the population distributions of the major mtdna haplogroups are consistent with higher gene flow and admixture into caste populations than into tribal groups. these results are concordant with previous analyses of these caste and tribal samples using sanger-sequenced mtdna hvs <dig> and lineage-defining snvs  <cit>  and demonstrate the feasibility of generating high-quality mitochondrial genomes using exl-wgs.fig.  <dig> the proportion of major mtdna haplogroups in castes and tribal populations. all haplogroups are defined using complete mtdna sequences




discussion
in the past, snp genotyping arrays have been used to survey genomic diversity in previously unexplored populations  <cit> . with the ever-decreasing sequencing cost, exl-wgs  provides an alternative, and for some study designs, better approach for studying population diversity than snp arrays. the primary benefits of exl-wgs over snp arrays include discovering population-specific variants for analyzing fine-scale population structure, improving imputation power, and providing high-quality mitochondrial genomes. in addition, even at current sequencing costs, the cost of exl-wgs is comparable to or even lower than snp arrays.

fine-scale population structure
snp genotyping arrays are usually designed using existing genetic information. therefore, for populations that have not been studied extensively and do not have a good reference population, the snp array is likely to miss population-specific variants and bias population structure analysis  <cit> . an accurate population structure/ancestry analysis is not only important for population genetic and evolutionary genetic studies, it is also crucial for association studies  <cit> .

here we demonstrate the benefit of exl-wgs over snp genotyping arrays by studying populations from south asia. the indian subcontinent has witnessed multiple waves of migration since the first migration of modern humans out of africa , which resulted in a highly variable genetic diversity among south asian populations  <cit> . we were able to examine the fine-scale population structure using  <dig> , <dig> snvs with maf ≥ 10% among sas-ap samples. there were ~ <dig>  common variants that are not present in the 1000gp3-sas dataset and ~ <dig> variants that are absent in the dbsnp database. our pca result suggests that sas-ap tribal populations are distinct from caste populations , and the caste samples are roughly clustered along the caste groups but the clusters are less distinguishable than tribal groups . the admixture analysis suggests south asian samples can be predominantly divided into two clines, one aligned with populations having west eurasian ancestry and one aligned with populations having east asian ancestry. in our analysis, all castes are closer to the eurasians than to the east asians along these clines. the position of caste populations along the west eurasian cline is consistent with previous results on higher ani component in higher ranks  <cit> . the khonda dora population is clearly more aligned with the east asian cline, supporting a recent report about an east asian ancestry component in indian tribal populations  <cit> . the irula population has a predominantly asi profile making them distinct from both the west eurasian and east asian clines . our results present an unbiased estimate of genetic diversity in south asian populations and demonstrate the exl-wgs design can be used to study the population structure.

in addition to the genotype based population genetic analyses, we also tested the methods that are designed for low-coverage wgs and directly use genotype likelihood for analysis. the results of pca, admixture, and fst analyses are largely congruent between the two sets of analyses . compared with the gl-based methods, calling genotypes with our current pipeline has different advantages and utilities. for example, for multi-individual variant calling, snptools can leverage linkage association information and impute genotypes for sites that have no variant reads or sequence coverage. so the number of genotype calls from snptools is higher than the number of sites with sequence coverage. in our comparison with the gold standard encode dataset the genotype calls at sites with no sequencing coverage has a high accuracy  in our dataset . in addition, for studies that need to combine data from different types of technologies, it is more straight-forward to combine genotypes.

several other programs, such as beagle  <cit>  and stitch  <cit> , can also perform imputation on low-coverage samples without a reference panel, similar to snptools we used in this study. however, beagle is optimized for use in a setting with available reference panels, and we have also demonstrated the efficacy of beagle in this respect in this study. stitch is optimized for read based haplotype construction for imputation and phasing. in comparison, the snptools imputation engine is independent of read length and is optimized for genotyping variants. this approach would allow a researcher to maximize the value of exl-wgs data even with short read lengths.

enhanced imputation reference panel
another advantage of exl-wgs over snp arrays is the improved power in imputation. many populations in the indian subcontinent have been found to have founder events, resulting in a higher burden of recessive diseases  <cit> . in this situation, imputation strategies using existing reference panels can be ineffective for gene mapping studies involving unique recessive variants  <cit> . however, with an appropriate reference panel, even coverages as low as  <dig> x may be sufficient to achieve more than 90% of the effective population size surveyed by a dense one million site snp array designed for variants with maf ≥ 5%  <cit> . as shown in our result, the exl-wgs reference panel improves the imputation power over a generic 1000gp3-sas reference panel, even though the 1000gp3-sas samples were also from the indian subcontinent. moreover, our methodology of producing reference panels, can be used for using off target reads from large existing cohorts of whole exome sequencing datasets, many of which have read lengths less than 100 bp  <cit> .

high quality mitochondrial genome
lastly, exl-wgs allows the interrogation of mitochondrial genomes of the sequenced samples. even with ~ <dig> x coverage exl-wgs design we obtained high-coverage mitochondrial genome sequence  and generated high-quality mitochondrial haplotypes for every sas-ap sample. using the haplotypes we were able to examine the material lineage diversity among the samples. among tribal samples, all irula people have the deep-rooted ancestral mitochondrial haplogroup m that is typical of south asia. thirteen percent of the khonda dora samples have the mitochondrial haplogroup u. although haplogroup u is shared with western european populations, it has some deep  india-specific branches  <cit> . the mitochondrial haplogroup k is only observed in the brahmin populations, and it is estimated that this haplogroup arose in west eurasia within the last  <dig>  years  <cit> . these results are consistent with previous studies and demonstrate exl-wgs can be used for high-resolution mitochondrial haplotype studies.

feasibility and necessity of wgs
in our project the average yield of snvs per individual is approximately  <dig>  million for maf ≥ 10%, and a snp genotyping array of comparable yield will cost ~ $170/sample. the cost of sequencing one gigabase has been estimated to be less than $ <dig> on a hiseq  <dig>  <cit> . accounting for library preparation costs of about $ <dig> per sample  <cit> , the total cost of sequencing a genome with  <dig> x coverage is less than $ <dig>  advances in library preparation methods can lead to further cost reductions of almost half  <cit> .

for coverages less than 2x, there is a valid concern about genotyping accuracy, especially for heterozygotes. in a recent case-control study involving more than  <dig>  samples with an average depth of coverage ~ <dig>  x, mean genotype concordance was better than 98% with respect to deep wgs gold standard datasets and snp arrays  <cit> . even though more than  <dig> cases were used by  <cit>  to replicate signals for common variation, coverage as low as  <dig> x may be sufficient to infer fine-scaled ancestry information among worldwide continental populations  <cit> . indeed, with multiple sample joint-calling and genotyping using snptools, followed by snptools imputation, we achieved excellent calling accuracy for heterozygous snvs . even for sites that have no coverage in an individual, we achieved high genotyping accuracy  for heterozygous snvs. our results are consistent with previous studies and demonstrate the power of exl-wgs design in leveraging genetic information at the population level.

CONCLUSIONS
the advances in sequencing technologies are making exl-wgs a more cost-effective and advantageous strategy than snp genotyping arrays for studying new populations. exl-wgs allows for the discovery of population-specific variants that are not present on a snp array, provides a population-specific reference panel for imputation, and generate a high-quality mitochondrial genome for each sample.
