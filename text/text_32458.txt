BACKGROUND
rice blast caused by the heterothallic ascomycete magnaporthe oryzae, is the most destructive disease of cultivated rice worldwide and can lead to severe losses of annual rice yield  <cit> . under normal conditions, the fungus uses a highly specialized infection structure appressorium generated from a conidium for plant penetration  <cit> . after successful penetration, the invasive hyphae grow rapidly in the host cells and caused blast lesions. in  <dig> to 7 days, the pathogen produces numerous conidia from the lesions and initiates a new infection cycle.

regulation of gene expression at the level of transcription controls many crucial biological processes. a number of different factors, including transcription factors, are essential for the process of transcription. transcription factors can recognize dna in a sequence-specific manner and modulate the frequency of initiation of transcription upon binding to specific sites in the promoter of target genes. the transcription factors can be activators, repressors, or both usually display a modular structure named the dna-binding domain  <cit> . in m. oryzae, numerous transcription factors were identified and characterized to be important for proper regulation of infection related morphogenesis  <cit> . in our previous study, many transcription factors, including mocrz <dig>  moap <dig>  moatf <dig>  mohac <dig>  mobzip <dig>  moswi <dig> and momsn <dig> were reported to be involved in hyphal growth, asexual development, stress response, infectious growth and virulence by controlling the expression levels of a series of target genes  <cit> . in plants, myb protein family comprises a large members of transcription factors  <cit> . the first identified myb gene was the ‘oncogene’ v-myb derived from the avian myeloblastosis virus  <cit> . following v-myb, a large and growing family of myb-related genes were discovered in a wide variety of eukaryotes including animals, plants, fungi and slime molds  <cit> . the myb-related proteins contain a dna-binding domain and generally function in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, often by co-regulating gene expression along with dna-binding proteins of other classes  <cit> .

myb proteins play important roles in controlling phenylpropanoid metabolism, cell shape, and hormonal responses during seed development and germination, and cellular proliferation in plants  <cit> . additionally, two myb proteins from fungi, cdc <dig> and flbd were also reported to control cell shape  <cit> . in schizosaccharomyces pombe, the cdc5p is essential for g2/m progression and cdc <dig> family members participate in a novel pathway to regulate g2/m progression  <cit> . in aspergillus nidulans, flbd encodes a myb-like dna-binding protein and is required for early conidiophore development by activating a cascade of transcription factors for conidiophore production  <cit> . here, we investigate the role of momyb <dig> in growth and infection-related morphogenesis in m. oryzae. deletion of momyb <dig> resulted in a failure to develop conidiophores and conidia, and more tolerance to osmotic stressors. furthermore, momyb <dig> plays a crucial role in cell wall integrity and tissue-specific infection of m. oryzae.

RESULTS
identification of m. oryzae myb1
the myb family of proteins is a group of functionally diverse transcriptional activators that is characterized by a conserved dna-binding domain of approximately  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . here, we identified an s. cerevisiae bas <dig> homolog myb <dig> from the m. oryzae genome by a blast_p search. momyb <dig>  encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids possesses two sant  domains that are interrupted by one intron  <cit> . alignment analysis showed that momyb <dig> shares similarities to the homologs from s. cerevisiae, a. nidulans, schizosaccharomyces pombe, homo sapiens, arabidopsis thaliana and zea mays  <cit> . the amino acid sequence identity being 16%, 29%, 15%, 22%, 14%, and 21%, respectively. the alignment of repeat dna-binding domains was shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  southern blot analysis revealed momyb <dig> only had a unique copy in m. oryzae genome 

momyb <dig> is highly expressed during conidia and plant colonization
to gain insight into the functions of momyb <dig>  we first examined the gene expression profile at hyphal, conidial and infectious stages of m. oryzae by qrt-pcr. in comparison to the hyphal stage , the expression of momyb <dig> was significantly increased in conidial and infection stages. the abundance of momyb <dig> was increased by 55-fold  in conidial stage and increased by 40-fold  and 71-fold  in the infectious stage .figure  <dig>

targeted deletion of momyb <dig> in m. oryzae
to evaluate the role of momyb <dig> in growth and development of m. oryzae, deletion mutant were generated by replacing the momyb <dig> gene with the hygromycin phosphotransferase resistance cassette . hygromycin resistant transformants were first screened by genomic pcr and further confirmed by southern blot analysis and rt-pcr . since all successful gene deletion mutants yield the same phenotypes, only one mutant was selected to analyze the biological phenotypes in this study. for complementation, a  <dig>  kb fragment containing the native promoter and orf of momyb <dig> gene was cloned into pyf <dig>  <cit>  and reintroduced into the Δmomyb <dig> mutant. the resulting transformants were confirmed by rt-pcr to obtain the complemented strain Δmomyb1/momyb <dig> .

momyb <dig> is involved in vegetative growth and is essential for conidiogenesis
to determine whether momyb <dig> was involved in growth and conidiation, the wild type guy <dig>  Δmomyb <dig> mutants and the complemented transformant Δmomyb1/momyb <dig> were inoculated on cm, sdc and v <dig> agar plates. compared to guy <dig> and Δmomyb1/momyb <dig>  the Δmomyb <dig> mutants showed significant reduced vegetative growth on these three media . the conidiation was also quantified on cm, v <dig>  oatmeal  and sdc media, the result revealed that the production of conidia in the Δmomyb <dig> mutants was completely abolished on these four media . to find out the potential reasons of the conidiation defect, we further stained the aerial hyphe with lactophenol cotton blue as described  <cit> , and no conidiophores was observed in the Δmomyb <dig> mutants, while normal gray conidiophores were formed in the wild type guy <dig> .figure  <dig>

momyb <dig> modulates the transcription of several conidiogenesis-related genes
because momyb <dig> is a putative myb transcription factor, which is required for an early stage of conidiation, we speculate that momyb <dig> acts as a transcription factor that regulates the expression of other conidiation-related genes. to test this hypothesis, the expression of several conidiation-related genes or their orthologs was analyzed  <cit> . the results revealed that momsn <dig>  a homologue of scmsn <dig> of s. cerevisiae, and moflbc, homologous to flbc of a. nidulans, and glutamine synthetase , homologous to flug of a. nidulans, and mostua, homologous to stua of a. nidulans, and mocon <dig>  homologous to con <dig> of n. crassa, was significantly down-regulated in the Δmomyb <dig> mutant .figure  <dig>

momyb <dig> plays an essential role in virulence on rice roots but not on leaves
since Δmomyb <dig> mutant have a conidiation defect, the mycelial plugs of the wild type guy <dig>  Δmomyb <dig> mutant and the complemented transformant were inoculated on the detached rice leaves to test the pathogenic abilities. after 7 days incubation, the Δmomyb <dig> mutants caused large and extended lesions similar to that of the wild type guy <dig> and the complemented transformant . we further examined the pathogenicity of the Δmomyb <dig> mutant on rice roots. unlike to the results on rice leaves, the Δmomyb <dig> mutant caused no virulence on roots 9 days after inoculation. in contrast, the wild type guy <dig> and the complemented transformant caused typical rice blast lesions under the same conditions . these results suggested that momyb <dig> played an important role in tissue-specific infection of m. oryzae. to confirm this result, we observed the infectious hyphal growth in the rice root by transforming a green fluorescence protein  into wild type guy <dig> and Δmomyb <dig> mutant, respectively. the results showed that the wild type could penetrate through the root epidermis and formed branching invasive hyphae at 48 h, while successful penetration and development of invasive hyphae were rarely observed in the Δmomyb <dig> mutant .figure  <dig>

deletion of momyb <dig> results in more insensitive to salt and osmotic stresses
to address the role of momyb <dig> in environmental adaptation, the wild-type guy <dig>  Δmomyb <dig> mutant and the complemented transformant were inoculated on the cm agar plates containing the salt  and osmotic  stresses, respectively. compared with the wild-type and the complemented transformant, the Δmomyb <dig> mutant showed less sensitivity to nacl, kcl and sorbitol . the growth rate of the Δmomyb <dig> mutant was much higher than that of wild type and the complemented transformant . this result suggested that momyb <dig> has a crucial role in response to salt and osmotic stresses. since hog <dig> pathway was the most important signal pathway to responsible for stress response in m. oryzae  <cit> , we examined the expression of four major components of the pathway, including mossk <dig>  mossk <dig>  mopbs <dig> and moosm <dig> . the results revealed that, besides mossk <dig>  the expression levels of mossk <dig>  mopbs <dig> and moosm <dig> were significantly decreased in the Δmomyb <dig> mutant compared to the wild type guy <dig> .figure  <dig> Δmomyb1

momyb <dig> is involved in cell wall integrity
to determine whether momyb <dig> has a role in maintenance cell wall integrity, we test mycelial growth on cfw which inhibit fungal cell wall assembly by binding chitin. the results showed that the growth rate of the Δmomyb <dig> mutant on cfw media was significantly decreased, which reduced to  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the wild type guy <dig> under  <dig>   <dig>  and 600 μg/ml cfw, respectively, while the complemented transformant Δmomyb1/momyb <dig> can fully restore the defects . chitin is a major component of fungal cell wall and is synthesized by chitin synthases and m. oryzae contains seven chitin synthases  <cit> . therefore, we examined the transcription levels of these chitin synthase genes by qrt-pcr analysis. the results revealed that the expression of all chitin synthase genes was significantly decreased in the Δmomyb <dig> mutant . we also examined the chitin content of the mutant and found the chitin content was remarkably reduced in the Δmomyb <dig> mutant compared to the wild type , indicating momyb <dig> has a role in cell wall assembly. to further confirm this conclusion, the mycelia of wild type guy <dig> and the Δmomyb <dig> mutant were treated with cell wall degrading enzyme. the results showed that the Δmomyb <dig> mutant was more sensitive to the enzyme treatment and released more protoplast after incubation for  <dig> and 90 min compared to the wild type guy <dig> . when observed at 60 min, the Δmomyb <dig> mutant displayed a greater number of protoplasts and no mycelia fragments were observed. in contrast, the wild type showed much less protoplasts and many mycelial fragments were found under the same condition .figure  <dig>

discussion
in the present study, we characterized a myb family protein, momyb <dig> in m. oryzae and primarily focused on its external phenotypes associated with pathogenesis. gene-targeted replacement revealed that the loss of momyb <dig> led to a plethora of developmental defects in vegetative growth, conidiation, stress response, cell wall integrity and virulence.

conidiogenesis and appressorium development are key steps in the rice blast disease cycle. the fungus has evolved regulatory networks to ensure the correct timing and spatial pattern of these development events  <cit> . the expression profile of momyb <dig> at hyphal, conidial and infectious stages of m. oryzae suggested that momyb <dig> might have a crucial role in conidial development and plant infection. deletion of momyb <dig> in m. oryzae affected different developmental stages, including hyphal growth, cell wall assembly and penetration. in addition, the Δmomyb <dig> mutants displayed no conidia and conidiophores, suggesting that deletion of momyb <dig> in m. oryzae completely abolished conidiophore development and thus affected conidium production. therefore, we conclude that momyb <dig> is a key regulator of m. oryzae for conidium and conidiophore development. qrt-pcr analysis revealed the expression level of five conidiogenesis-related genes were significantly decreased in the ∆momyb <dig> mutant, indicating that momyb <dig> probably functions as a key upstream transcription factor in the conidiogenesis signalling pathway to regulate the expression of genes which involved in conidiophore and conidium development. however, whether these conidiogenesis-related genes directly regulated by momyb <dig> need further studies. one surprise result was that the ∆momyb <dig> mutant caused rice blast on rice roots, but not on leaves. since the infectious mechanism of m. oryzae on rice roots has been well clarified  <cit> , we conclude that the pathogenic difference in ∆momyb <dig> on the two organs is a result of tissue-specific infectious-related development mechanisms.

cell fate specification is a process of fundamental importance during development. in maize, gl <dig> encodes a protein containing a myb dna-binding domain and is expressed most highly very early during trichome development and is a central regulator of the trichome cell fate decision  <cit> . two myb proteins from fungi, the cdc <dig> gene product from s. pombe  <cit>  and the flbd gene product from a. nidulans  <cit>  can also control aspects of cell shape, indicating myb proteins are related to cell wall integrity. our results show that momyb <dig> is involved in the response to multiple stresses via regulating different signalling pathways including hog <dig> pathway, which contributes to osmoregulation. the insensitive or hypersensitive of ∆momyb <dig> mutant to variety of stresses may also indicate that momyb <dig> is involved in cell wall integrity.

chitin is an integral part of the fungal cell wall and its synthesis depends on the activity of chitin synthase enzymes. in the present study, the ∆momyb <dig> deletion mutants showed high sensitivity to the cell wall stressor cfw. in m. oryzae, seven chitin synthases encoding genes were characterized to involve in the development and pathogenicity by affected chitin content  <cit> . in other phytopathogenic fungi, chitin synthases also play crucial roles in proper regulation of infection-related morphogenesis  <cit> . in the ∆momyb <dig> mutant, the transcriptional levels of seven chitin synthases were down-regulated and the chitin content was also decreased in the mutant, suggesting that momyb <dig> may be a multi-stress regulator of m. oryzae that contributes to the loss of pathogenicity. momyb <dig> might directly or indirectly regulate chitin synthesis, thus may disturb the responses of cell wall signalling pathways to different stressors.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that momyb <dig> functions as a key regulator that important for vegetative growth, conidiogenesis, stress response and pathogenicity in m. oryzae. momyb <dig> is also involved in the maintenance of cell wall integrity that are crucial for the growth and development of the fungus.
