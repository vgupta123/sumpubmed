BACKGROUND
the widespread fungus aspergillus flavus is a saprophytic and opportunistic pathogen that is capable of causing diseases in agricultural crops  <cit> , producing toxic secondary metabolites, and bringing about health problems in animals and humans  <cit> . under favorable conditions, a. flavus produces polyketide-derived carcinogenic and mutagenic secondary metabolites, aflatoxins  <cit> , which are extremely hepatotoxic, immunosuppressive, and antinutritional mycotoxins associated with both acute and chronic toxicity in humans and animals  <cit> . besides the health implications in humans and animals, a. flavus colonization in crops causes considerable economic losses because of reduced utilization and lower price of aflatoxin-contaminated grains.

to develop effective means of combating aflatoxin contamination, it is of vital importance to investigate the molecular mechanisms of development and secondary metabolism in a. flavus. previous studies identified numerous diverse biochemical substances and extracts with adverse effects on the development and/or secondary metabolism of a. flavus . resveratrol  is a phytoalexin with antifungal activity and antioxidant capacity, which can enhance host plant resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . our previous study found that resveratrol is highly related to resistance to aflatoxin production in peanut seeds and could inhibit aflatoxin production in medium  <cit> . in addition, resveratrol affected mycelial morphologic characteristics and inhibited conidia formation of a. flavus in medium. however, how resveratrol affects the development and secondary metabolism of a. flavus remains unknown.

rna-sequencing  is a powerful and cost-efficient high-throughput technology for transcriptomic profiling analysis that has been successfully used to interrogate transcriptomes of numerous fungi . the application of this technology has greatly accelerated our understanding of the complexity of gene expression, regulation, and networks  <cit> . gene expression can be more accurately quantified using rna-seq approaches than conventional transcriptomic analysis  <cit> . with higher sensitivity, rna-seq can also be more efficient in detecting a larger range of dynamically expressed genes than microarrays. furthermore, rna-seq has been used to survey sequence variations and complex transcriptomes with low false-positive rates and high sensitivity and reproducibility  <cit> . for an organism with a well-annotated genome, mapping read sequences to the corresponding reference genome/transcriptome is usually the first and essential step for rna-seq data analysis  <cit> . moreover, the “reference-based” rna-seq approach was proved to be more sensitive and have higher computational efficiency than a de novo assembly approach  <cit> . the construction of expressed sequences tags in a. flavus was reported by several researchers  <cit> , and the whole-genome sequencing of the fungus was completed  <cit> . annotation of the a. flavus genome revealed numerous genes and gene clusters that are potentially involved in conidia formation and secondary metabolic processes including aflatoxin biosynthesis  <cit> . the transcriptomic analysis of aflatoxin biosynthesis and mycelia development in a. flavus in response to 5-azacytidine  <cit> , decanal  <cit> , water activity  <cit> , and temperature  <cit>  also used rna-seq technology.

to comprehensively understand the effect of resveratrol on the development and secondary metabolism of a. flavus, an rna-seq approach was applied in this study to obtain transcriptomic profiles of a. flavus at the whole-genome level. differentially expressed genes  associated with mycelial growth, conidia formation, and aflatoxin biosynthesis were revealed by comparing resveratrol-treated and untreated samples of a. flavus. this study would be meaningful for further annotating the genome of a. flavus, an understanding of aflatoxin biosynthesis and improving aflatoxin contamination management in agricultural products.

RESULTS
effect of resveratrol on the development and aflatoxin production of a. flavus
morphological characteristics and aflatoxin concentrations were quantified to define the effect of resveratrol on the fungal development and toxigenicity of a. flavus. the dry biomass of a. flavus mycelia grown in liquid a&m medium did not show significant difference between the resveratrol treatment  and the control  . a similar result was obtained using solid a&m medium, in which resveratrol treatment did not significantly change the diameter of fungal mycelioid colonies . however, obvious variation in morphological characteristics of mycelia in response to resveratrol treatment in shaking liquid culture was observed . the vegetative mycelial morphologic characteristics of a. flavus were different between the am and the am-res cultures, and the vegetative mycelia of a. flavus appeared some smaller ones in the am-res. resveratrol may affect the germination rate of conidia or growth rate of vegetative mycelia, leading to differences in the length of the mycelia. the results indicated that resveratrol did not affect the biomass accumulation of a. flavus, but it could influence the development of fungal mycelia.table  <dig> effect of resveratrol on the development and aflatoxin production of a. flavus

because no fungal conidium was detected in liquid culture, solid a&m medium was used to investigate the effect of resveratrol on conidia production by a. flavus. the number of conidia was  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> per 20 ml medium in the control and resveratrol treatment , respectively . in addition, the number of conidia was  <dig>  ×  <dig>   <dig>  ×  <dig>   <dig>  ×  <dig>  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> per 20 ml medium with resveratrol at concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively. conidia formation of a. flavus was decreased in the resveratrol treatment compared with the control.

the aflatoxin concentration was measured after 7 days of growth in liquid culture. the aflatoxin content in the resveratrol-treated culture  was  <dig>  μg/l, which was much less than that in the control , indicating that resveratrol inhibited aflatoxin formation. our previous results also indicated that a resveratrol concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml or higher inhibited aflatoxin production  <cit> .

defining the a. flavus transcriptome
illumina sequencing of the resveratrol-treated and untreated a. flavus af <dig> generated  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million raw reads per library, respectively. among total reads, approximately  <dig> million reads were purified from each group , which included  <dig>  million  and  <dig>  million  reads that were uniquely mapped to the a. flavus reference genome . the data sets could represent the expressed sequences or transcriptomes of each library. matching the reads to genes is important to annotate sequences because it could reveal the molecular mechanism behind gene expression  <cit> . thus, transcriptomic data obtained in this experiment were used not only to define the differential gene expression in response to resveratrol but also to identify hitherto unknown transcripts including putative isoforms. the genic distribution of reads from mrna-seq of the resveratrol-treated af <dig>  indicated that most reads  were mapped to protein-coding genes. the others were distributed between introns  and intergenic regions  . the distribution of reads in the control af <dig>  was similar to that of the resveratrol-treated , but fewer reads in the control were mapped to exons . in total,  <dig>  gb of valid clean reads were yielded, and  <dig>  %  of the  <dig>  gb of collected read pairs that passed filtering were mapped uniquely to the genome , which was higher than the rna-seq data published previously for a. flavus  <cit>  and a. oryzae  <cit> .fig.  <dig> classification of raw reads. raw reads including clean reads , adapter sequences , reads containing undefined nucleotides  , and low-quality reads  generated from illumina rna-sequencing

in  <dig>  a 5× sequence coverage of the a. flavus genome was released by j. craig venter research institute, which has been recently updated at several web sites . the a. flavus genome is about 37 mb on  <dig> chromosomes, and it encodes over  <dig>  functional genes , which previously were annotated as open reading frames in the genome without unambiguous transcript information. we quantified the overall transcriptional activity of genes in this study by calculating the number of reads per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads   <cit> . we found that  <dig>   of the  <dig>  genes  in the a. flavus genome database had expression with rpkm ≥  <dig> in either of the two samples .

besides the small fraction of reads that mapped to rrna, approximately 11 % of reads could not be mapped to the encoding regions. this might be due to non-coding rnas or novel exons of known genes. novel genes were identified by assembling the rna-seq data from the two samples using cufflinks  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . among the  <dig>  annotated genes expressed in the two samples,  <dig>  were previously annotated genes and  <dig> were novel genes . according to the improved genome annotation, the transcriptional activity of the genes was estimated.

functional classification of a. flavus degs in response to resveratrol
the differently expressed genes between the two libraries provide a clue to the molecular mechanism related to the a. flavus response to resveratrol. by comparing expression levels in resveratrol-treated and untreated samples, we identified  <dig> genes that were significantly differentially transcribed  between the two samples, including  <dig> genes  showing a 10-fold change . of these,  <dig> genes  were up-regulated and  <dig>  genes were down-regulated. genes with altered expression were related to a wide variety of regulatory and metabolic processes.

functional assignments were defined by gene ontology  terms , which provided a broad functional classification of genes and gene products for various biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular localizations. go functional enrichment analysis revealed that these significantly degs were mainly involved in fatty acid metabolic process, monocarboxylic acid metabolic process, signaling receptor activity, phosphorelay sensor kinase activity, protein histidine kinase activity, and phosphotransferase activity   . as mentioned above, a. flavus and other aspergilli preferentially colonize crop seeds with a high oil content because these crops contain high levels of unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic  and oleic acid , which are substrates for oxygenases  <cit> . oxylipins, derived from oxygenases, are a class of oxygenated, unsaturated fatty acids involved in signaling pathways in filamentous fungi, yeasts, oomycetes, plants, and animals  <cit> . a family of oxylipin-producing oxygenases and their products, which is encoded by ppo  and lox , are involved in regulating sclerotia and conidia formation and secondary metabolism in a. flavus, a. nidulans, and a. parasiticus  <cit> . oxylipins could potentially interact with g-protein-coupled receptor complexes upstream of the heterotrimeric g-protein complex that regulates aflatoxin/sterigmatocystin production  <cit> . moreover, the transcription of genes of fatty acid synthases , the key genes in the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway cluster, was significantly down-regulated when a. flavus was treated with resveratrol.table  <dig> gene ontology  functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes when a. flavus was treated with resveratrol

to further investigate the biological functions and interactions of genes, pathway-based analysis was conducted using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway database, which records the network of molecular interactions in the cells and variants specific to particular organisms. however, kegg metabolic pathway analysis failed to confirm enrichment in any pathway in the rna-seq data  obtained in this study, which is consistent with results of a previous study by lin  <cit> .

validation of rna-seq analysis by quantitative real-time pcr 
it is common practice to validate rna-seq differential analysis with quantitative analysis of a subset of genes by qrt-pcr. thus, we compared qrt-pcr expression levels of  <dig> degs randomly selected from the resveratrol-treated and untreated a. flavus samples . gene-specific primer pairs  were designed according to the  <dig> genes’ sequences using the online primer 3-blast program . the qrt-pcr data mirrored the quantification by rna-seq , with a significant correlation , indicating the authenticity of these degs. thus, these comparisons of data from qrt-pcr and rna-seq of strain af <dig> not only validated the transcriptome analysis, but also reinforced the power of next-generation sequencing in quantifying the entire repertoire of genes.table  <dig> primer pairs for each target gene for quantitative real-time pcr

gene expression of the secondary metabolism gene clusters in response to resveratrol
the a. flavus genome sequence contains hallmark enzymatic genes associated with secondary metabolite synthesis, including  <dig> putative secondary metabolism gene clusters  <cit> . each secondary metabolism gene cluster contains enzymatic genes and transcription factors for compound synthesis  <cit> . to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on the regulation of secondary metabolism, we used the information from the web-based software secondary metabolite unknown regions finder  to identify the putative secondary metabolism gene clusters of a. flavus. among the  <dig> clusters in the a. flavus genome, the expression levels of most clusters were not significantly affected by resveratrol . by comparing the expression levels of secondary metabolic genes in resveratrol-treated and untreated samples, we identified  <dig> genes  in  <dig> secondary metabolism gene clusters that were significantly differentially transcribed , with  <dig> backbone genes  . the backbone genes included a non-ribosomal peptide synthase , which is an enzyme that produces a polypeptide independent of ribosomes, and an nrps-like synthase , which was named because it does not contain all of the typical domains normally found in an nrps  <cit> .

in the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway cluster,  <dig> genes were identified as cluster # <dig>  <cit> . in this study, the transcription of  <dig> of the  <dig> genes was depressed to various degrees with resveratrol treatment, and only  <dig> genes  were not down-regulated . interestingly, afla  and aflb  were significantly down-regulated . afla and aflb encode the fatty acid synthetase alpha subunit  and beta subunit , respectively, which catalyze the reaction between acetyl-coa and malonyl-coa to form the starter unit hexanoate of aflatoxin biosynthesis  <cit> . however, the transcription regulator genes aflr  and afls  in the cluster showed only medium or slight down-regulation , and the transcription of the global secondary metabolite regulators laea  and vea  did not show significant depression . moreover, the expression of three genes  was too low in the control sample to be distinguished by htseq .table  <dig> differentially expressed genes related to the development and conidial formation of a. flavus

in cluster # <dig>  only the backbone gene afla_ <dig>  encoding a dimethylallyl transferase  enzyme, had significantly down-regulated transcription , but the transcription of the other  <dig> genes in this cluster was not significantly different when resveratrol was applied . also, in cluster # <dig>  which has an unknown product, only the backbone gene afla_ <dig>  encoding a polyketide synthetase  enzyme, was significantly up-regulated with resveratrol treatment  . a total of  <dig> genes in cluster # <dig> , # <dig> , and # <dig>  showed significant differential transcription  with resveratrol treatment. the products of these three clusters are unknown, but their backbone enzymes were predicted by smurf. the backbone enzyme of cluster # <dig> is an nrps-like enzyme, which is encoded by afla_ <dig>  the backbone gene afla_ <dig> of cluster # <dig> encodes the nrps pes <dig>  and the backbone enzyme of cluster # <dig> is a pks. genes in the other secondary metabolism gene clusters did not show significantly altered expression when resveratrol was applied. only a few genes, such as afla_ <dig> in cluster # <dig>  afla_ <dig> in cluster # <dig>  afla_ <dig> in cluster # <dig>  afla_ <dig> in cluster # <dig>  afla_ <dig> in cluster # <dig>  afla_ <dig> in cluster # <dig>  and afla_ <dig> in cluster # <dig>  were significantly affected  .

expression analysis of a. flavus growth- and conidial development-related genes in response to resveratrol
using the expression profiles of a. flavus in different treatments, especially the  <dig> genes that were significantly differentially transcribed , we observed that some genes involved in mycelial and conidial development were down-regulated when resveratrol was applied . noticeably, the transcription of the so-called fluffy gene family , whose null mutants have a fluffy or floccose phenotype  <cit> , was down-regulated to various degrees . flug  and flbc  showed significantly depressed transcriptional levels  when a. flavus was treated with resveratrol. flug encodes an extracellular development signal protein, which may function as a gsi-related enzyme in the synthesis of a small diffusible factor that acts as an extracellular signal directing asexual sporulation and other aspects of colony growth in a. nidulans  <cit> . flbc encodes a zinc finger protein  that is required for morphogenesis and the elongation of flagellar filaments by facilitating polymerization of the flagellin monomers at the tip of a growing filament in escherichia coli  <cit> . concurrently, some conidia-specific genes  were down-regulated slightly . the molecular action of conidial hydrophobins roda/rola  and rodb/hypb  contributed to the structural integrity of the cell wall  <cit> . in addition, the transcription of genes related to conidial development, such as brla , abaa , weta , stua , gpaa/fada , and medusa , was decreased to a certain extent . interestingly, transcription of the stua gene , which encodes the apses transcription factor stua that affects the orderly differentiation and spatial organization of cell types of the conidiospore, was significantly decreased   <cit> .

we also found that the transcription of the gene afla_ <dig> was significantly increased. in a. oryzae, afla_ <dig> encodes a superoxide dismutase  that destroys radicals within the cells and is toxic to biological systems . interestingly, the transcription of genes involved in vacuolar proteins, such as afla_ <dig>  afla_ <dig>  afla_ <dig>  afla_ <dig>  afla_ <dig>  and novel  <dig>  was significantly increased . the vacuolar proteins may take advantage of the exchange of atmosphere and nutrients between the organism and the environment. nonribosomal peptide synthetase  is a key factor responsible for the biosynthesis of bioactive metabolites that potentially contribute to organismal virulence; nrps is encoded by afla_ <dig>  which was significantly down-regulated .

discussion
considerable progress has been achieved in reducing aflatoxin contamination in agricultural products  since the discovery that aflatoxin is extremely toxic to humans and animals  <cit> . many inhibitors  <cit>  have been demonstrated to have an inhibitory effect on aflatoxin biosynthesis in a. flavus. among them, plant-derived metabolites are of special interest. non-host plant metabolites, such as onion, garlic extracts, eugenol , khellin, visnagin  <cit> , caffeine, and piperlongumine  <cit>  inhibit a. flavus growth and/or aflatoxin production. at the same time, host plant-derived metabolites including luteolin  <cit> , eriodictyol  <cit> , and tanning acids  <cit>  also inhibit a. flavus development and/or aflatoxin production. however, most of these compounds can hardly be applied in practice because their biosynthesis pathway and the related biochemical steps are not well understood.

resveratrol, a natural phytoalexin, could protect plants from fungal infection and improve the defense capacity in plants  <cit> . some studies indicated that phytoalexins play an important role in resistance to aflatoxin contamination in peanut under drought stress  <cit> , and the isoflavone phytoalexin glyceollin from soybean could inhibit aflatoxin production  <cit> . field experiments demonstrated that a correlation existed between increased phytoalexins and decreased aflatoxin b <dig>  <cit> . the results from our previous experiments demonstrated that the resveratrol level was a factor that was relevant to aflatoxin resistance in peanut  <cit> . resveratrol could affect a. flavus development and inhibit conidia formation and aflatoxin production. moreover, the resveratrol biosynthetic pathway is well known  <cit> . thus, it is possible to enhance resveratrol biosynthesis and concentration by breeding or genetic engineering, which may provide an applicable means for aflatoxin contamination management. some transgenic studies indicated that resveratrol could inhibit other pathogenic fungi  <cit> . in addition, resveratrol has been suggested to have a beneficial effect on human health  <cit> . genetic improvement for an increased resveratrol content in crops could not only ensure food safety, but also enhance the nutritional value of agricultural products.

aflatoxins are polyketide-derived difurano cumarins, their biosynthesis involves at least  <dig> enzymatic reactions  <cit> . the first step in the biosynthesis requires the formation of the starter unit hexanoate from acetyl-coa and malonyl-coa catalyzed by fas- <dig> and fas- <dig>  <cit> , which is then catalyzed by pksa, a polyketide synthase encoded by aflc, to produce norsolorinic acid anthrone . the monooxygenase hypc oxidizes the intermediate naa to form anthraquinone norsolorinic acid, which is the first stable intermediate in aflatoxin biosynthesis  <cit> . in this study, we found that afla  and aflb  in the aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway cluster were significantly down-regulated when a. flavus was treated with resveratrol. aflatoxin is a highly oxygenated product, and oxidative stress is a prerequisite for aflatoxin production  <cit> . resveratrol-inhibited aflatoxin biosynthesis also has antioxidant activity. superoxide dismutase    had a significantly increased expression level when resveratrol was added to medium; it destroyed radicals that were normally produced within the cells and were toxic to biological systems. superoxide dismutases inhibit free radical scavenging and protect calcineurin  from inactivation  <cit> . the activity of calcineurin was enhanced at periods corresponding to aflatoxin production, and aflatoxin itself can inhibit calmodulin kinase activity  <cit> . calmodulin also activated acetyl-coa carboxylase, a key enzyme in aflatoxin biosynthesis  <cit> . the transcription of genes involved in vacuolar proteins significantly increased ; these proteins may be involved in the exchange of atmosphere and nutrients between the organism and the environment. moreover,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes in the aflatoxin metabolic cluster had depressed transcription levels. these observations suggested that resveratrol directly inhibits the expression of the aflatoxin pathway cluster genes afla and aflb, which could significantly suppress the formation of the starter unit  of aflatoxin biosynthesis. in addition, resveratrol highly increased the activity of antioxidative enzymes to limit aflatoxin production. there was also a certain amount of aflatoxin produced by a. flavus treated with resveratrol because aflatoxin biosynthesis was only partially inhibited rather than completely suppressed.

based on our experimental data, resveratrol could influence the mycelia development and conidia formation of a. flavus , as well as several other biochemical substances previously reported  <cit> . additionally, we have found that some genes involved in mycelial and conidial development were down-regulated when a. flavus was treated with resveratrol . the changes in mycelia  was affected by resveratrol, which may be related to the low-level expression of the so-called fluffy gene family. the formation of conidia, the asexual reproductive structure, in a. flavus requires the concerted activity of a number of signaling proteins and transcription factors  <cit> . transcription of the conidia-specific genes roda/rola and rodb/hypb was down-regulated slightly when resveratrol was applied , but the transcription of some genes related to conidial development showed various levels of depression when a. flavus was treated with resveratrol . brla, abaa, weta, and stua are pivotal regulators of conidiophore development and conidia maturation; they act individually and together to regulate their own expression and that of numerous other sporulation-related genes. the transcriptomic profiling showed that resveratrol significantly depressed the transcriptional levels of stua, flug, flbc, and other genes related to conidial development. brla, a cys2his2-type conidiation transcription factor, mediates the developmental switch from the apical growth pattern of vegetative cells to the budding growth of conidiophores; brla mutants cannot produce conidia  <cit> . the transcription factor abaa controls the temporal and spatial specificity of development in aspergillus. the expression of abaa leads to the activation of brla and weta and to the cessation of growth  <cit> . the regulatory protein weta is responsible for activating a set of genes whose products make up the final two conidial wall layers or direct their assembly  <cit> . the apses transcription factor stua  is required for the orderly differentiation and spatial organization of cell types of the conidiophores. stua affected the spatial localization of abaa and brla, and the expression of stua is dependent on a functional brla protein  <cit> . the transcript of gpaa/fada was involved in conidial development. a previous study demonstrated that Δgpra and Δgprd mutants did not exhibit hyper-conidiation when exposed to  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg fatty acid-soaked discs  <cit> . the transcriptomic profiling showed that resveratrol significantly depressed the transcriptional levels of stua, flug, flbc, and other genes related to conidial development. these results demonstrated that resveratrol greatly reduced conidia formation of a. flavus by affecting gene expression at the transcriptomic level.

numerous studies indicated that conidial development and secondary metabolism are co-regulated . the heterotrimeric nuclear complex  was demonstrated to be a global regulator of fungal development and secondary metabolism in aspergillus  <cit> . laea and vea are two critical genes in the formation of the velvet complex: vea bridges velb and laea to form the complex  <cit> . in our data, the transcription of laea and vea were slightly depressed in the a. flavus samples treated with resveratrol , which is consistent with the results of previous studies. microarray data provided evidence for laea regulation of  <dig> clusters, including the aflatoxin biosynthetic cluster, out of  <dig> secondary metabolism clusters in a. flavus  <cit> . vea regulates aflatoxin, aflatrem, and cyclopiazonic acid production  <cit> . in addition, null mutants of laea and vea produced fewer conidia and less aflatoxin in host seeds  <cit> . this indicated that the inhibition of laea and vea transcript levels by resveratrol may lead to a loss of toxin production and conidia formation.

CONCLUSIONS
resveratrol treatment of a. flavus decreased aflatoxin production and conidia formation, and it also caused abnormal mycelia development. first, resveratrol directly inhibited the expression of aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway cluster genes, the afla and aflb expression at significantly low transcriptional levels could result in an insufficient amount of the starter unit hexanoate for aflatoxin biosynthesis. in addition, resveratrol could significantly enhance the activity of antioxidative enzymes, which destroy radicals produced within the cells that are toxic to biological systems, leading to decreased aflatoxin production. second, the decreased transcription of flug and flbc could affect the mycelia  development and asexual sporulation. the altered appearance of mycelia and mycelioid colonies could be a result of the depressed transcription of the so-called fluffy gene family. third, resveratrol effectively decreased conidia formation of a. flavus, which may result from the suppressed transcription of genes related to conidial development. the low level of transcription of stua, brla, weta, and abaa, the pivotal regulators of conidial development and maturation, as well as other genes related to conidial development, disrupted the cell’s orderly differentiation and spatial organization of conidia, blocking conidia formation. fourth, the inhibition of laea and vea by resveratrol may lead to a loss of aflatoxin production and conidia formation, which further demonstrated that conidial development and secondary metabolism are co-regulated.
