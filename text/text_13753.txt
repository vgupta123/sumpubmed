BACKGROUND
swine dysentery  is a mucohaemorrhagic colitis of pigs resulting from infection of the large intestine with the anaerobic spirochaete brachyspira hyodysenteriae  <cit> . the disease has a worldwide distribution and causes significant economic loss. successful control programs for sd rely on accurate, cost-effective and timely detection of infected herds and animals. diagnosis is usually based on clinical signs and detection of the causative spirochaete by culture and/or pcr  <cit> . although not widely used, serological tests measuring serum immunoglobulins specific to b. hyodysenteriae have potential to be used at the herd level for routine surveillance  <cit> . elisa systems using whole spirochaete cells  <cit> , lipopolysaccharide   <cit> , and the b. hyodysenteriae outer membrane lipoprotein bhlp <dig>   <cit>  as antigens all have been described for this purpose. elevated antibody levels have been detected in pigs for up to  <dig> days following experimental infection  <cit> , and hence sera obtained from pigs at slaughter can be used to assess the likely sd status of the source herds  <cit> . this proposition was tested in the current study by following antibody levels in the experimental pigs for  <dig> weeks after experimental infection.

the subsequent aims of this study were to investigate two other potential applications of serological assays, as well as comparing the utility of the bhlp <dig>  and whole cell elisas detecting either igg or igm. being a serogroup-specific antigen, lps is not considered suitable for development of a universal diagnostic tool  <cit> , and therefore it was not included in the present evaluation. the first application involved monitoring antibody profiles in growing pigs in an infected herd to assess the herd infection dynamics and predict the time of infection, and the second explored using the elisas on muscle fluid  samples taken from pigs at slaughter. sampling muscle at the abattoir avoids the biosecurity risks of on-farm visits, and muscle is generally easier to collect and process at slaughter than is blood. hence muscle juice could be a convenient source of antibodies for routine screening of herds for evidence of infection with b. hyodysenteriae.

RESULTS
experimental infection
both experimentally challenged pigs excreted b. hyodysenteriae in their faeces in the week after challenge and showed transient diarrhoea without blood or mucus being present. they then recovered and remained healthy throughout the experimental period, and no subsequent spirochaete excretion was detected. igg and igm antibodies reacting with the wc antigen increased to a maximum at 4- <dig> weeks post-infection ; they then showed a slight decline, although they were still elevated at  <dig> weeks pi . in the case of the bhlp <dig>  antigen, antibody levels peaked at  <dig> weeks pi and the subsequent decline was more rapid than with the wc antigen, but the igg level in one pig became elevated again after  <dig> weeks pi .

culture and pcr results in the cohort study
no pigs in the two cohorts were positive for b. hyodysenteriae by culture and pcr at any sampling, although non-pathogenic b. innocens and unidentified brachyspira spp. were identified in the faeces of pigs from both farms at different times . two pigs from the cohort on farm c were positive for b. pilosicoli at  <dig> weeks of age. two of the  <dig> pigs from farm c that were not part of the cohort were positive for b. hyodysenteriae by culture and pcr when sampled at the abattoir.

antibody profiles in the cohort study
the average igg response to the b. hyodysenteriae wc antigen in the  <dig> pigs on the uninfected farm a did not show a significant change during the course of experiment, while there was a highly significant  increase with time in the cohort on infected farm c . in the latter farm there was a steady increase in mean igg from  <dig> weeks, with a peak at  <dig> weeks, followed by a slight decrease by  <dig> weeks. the pigs in farm c had significantly higher igg levels than those in farm a at  <dig> and  <dig> weeks . using bhlp <dig>  as the coating antigen, igg levels in both cohorts showed a significant increasing trend , with a peak at  <dig> weeks . mean igg levels were higher in the pigs in the cohort on farm c than those from the cohort on farm a, and this difference was significant at  <dig> weeks .

unlike igg dynamics, particularly in response to wc antigen, igm antibody levels displayed a similar trend for both negative and positive herds regardless of whether wc or bhlp <dig>  were used as elisa antigens . the average igm levels in the cohort of pigs in both herds were elevated significantly at  <dig> week, and thereafter remained elevated compared to those at  <dig> week .

cross-reactivities
using wc preparations of b. pilosicoli and b. innocens respectively as plate-coating antigens, in the cohorts from both farms a similar pattern of gradual and highly significant  increases in igg levels to both preparations was observed from  <dig> to  <dig> weeks . for both preparations mean antibody levels were higher in the cohort of pigs from farm c than in those from farm a, and for both the differences were significant at  <dig> and  <dig> weeks .

diagnostic threshold values in slaughtered pigs
the diagnostic threshold values for the slaughtered pigs, established using  <dig> serum or meat juice samples from pigs on each of the two non-infected farms, and calculated as three standard deviations above the mean absorbance value, are presented in table  <dig> 

sensitivity and specificity of elisas as a herd test
the numbers of pigs that gave positive results in the eight assays are shown in table  <dig>  generally, at the herd level all these assays worked well, with five of the assays having both 100% specificity and sensitivity. assays based on meat juice had 100% specificity and equivalent sensitivity to those based on serum. only the wc igm elisa with serum lacked specificity, because a sample from uninfected herd a gave a positive reading. the bhlp <dig>  igg elisa with serum and the wc igm elisa with meat juice lacked 100% sensitivity, because in both cases none of the samples from infected herd d gave positive readings.

a herds a and b known not to be infected with b. hyodysenteriae. fifty pigs were sampled from each herd.

detection levels
all four wc systems detected more positive serum samples in the three infected herd than did the corresponding bhlp <dig>  systems . the four tests using serum between them yielded  <dig> positive samples from the positive herds, compared to  <dig> using meat juice. overall, however, only eight individual serum samples were positive compared to  <dig> meat juice samples.

discussion
the experimental infection study demonstrated that pigs challenged with b. hyodysenteriae developed elevated concentrations of igg and igm in their serum to both wc and bhlp <dig>  antigen preparations. antibody levels had a dramatic increase 4- <dig> weeks after infection, and hence this might be an optimal interval after infection to seek serological evidence of infection using these antigens. thereafter the igg levels to bhlp <dig>  decreased more rapidly than did those to wc. one of the pigs showed a secondary increase in bhlp <dig> -reactive igg between  <dig> weeks and slaughter at  <dig> weeks, suggesting that a proliferation of the spirochaete may have occurred in that pig at around  <dig> weeks of age. unexpectedly, an increase in antibody was not detected in this pig using the wc elisa. as antibody levels to both antigen preparations remained elevated from  <dig> to  <dig> weeks, this confirms that sampling pigs at slaughter age should detect elevated antibody levels to the spirochaete.

in the cohort study, at no time were any of the sampled pigs found to be positive for b. hyodysenteriae by using culture and pcr. this was despite farm c being known to have sd, and having two colonized pigs detected amongst the additional  <dig> pigs from that farm that were sampled at the abattoir. there was no overt disease being expressed at farm c during the time of the study, and presumably the extent of colonization in individual pigs also was low. b. pilosicoli, b. innocens and/or other brachyspira spp. were identified at different times in some pigs on both farms. this observation demonstrated that the culture methods used for detection were appropriate, but also indicated that the pulsed medication at farm c did not completely prevent colonization with brachyspira species. without careful veterinary surveillance of this farm, it would be difficult to recognize it as being infected with b. hyodysenteriae. despite the lack of culture and pcr evidence for colonization, antibody levels to b. hyodysenteriae increased with time on farm c, to peak at around  <dig> weeks of age. based on the experimental infection study, this suggests that there was a degree of spirochaete proliferation amongst the cohort of pigs on farm c at around 12- <dig> weeks of age. this sort of information could be helpful for the consulting veterinarian, who might decide to medicate the pigs at this time to prevent excessive proliferation of the spirochaete that otherwise could depress growth rates and affect feed conversion.

differences were observed between the igg response patterns using wc and bhlp <dig>  as plate-coating antigens. b. hyodysenteriae wc preparations have been thought to potentially generate false positive results arising from cross-reactivities associated with exposure to other brachyspira species, or other bacteria with cross-reactive proteins  <cit> . in the pigs from the cohort on farm a, where sd did not occur, there was no significant temporal change in igg levels to the b. hyodysenteriae wc preparation, but there were significant increases to wc preparations from both b. pilosicoli and b. innocens. the seroconversions in responses to the protein content of b. pilosicoli and b. innocens further confirmed the presence of these organisms in both farms, in accordance with the results of culture and pcr. most importantly, the data provided additional evidence supporting the specificity of the b. hyodysenteriae wc igg elisa as a diagnostic test. on the other hand, it is possible that exposure to b. hyodysenteriae may generate antibodies that cross-react with wc preparations of b. pilosicoli and b. innocens. this was because antibody levels to antigen preparations from the latter two species were higher in the pigs from farm c than in those from farm a, despite these spirochaetes being present on both farms; moreover, their pattern of increase, peaking at around  <dig> weeks on farm c, closely resembled the pattern seen with the b. hyodysenteriae wc preparation.

although igg antibody levels to the b. hyodysenteriae wc preparation and to bhlp <dig>  both gave evidence of infection amongst the cohort on farm c, and could be used as tools to monitor infection, the wc preparation gave a better discrimination between the two cohorts at  <dig> weeks. an apparent problem with the bhlp <dig>  elisa in this study was the significant temporal increase in antibody levels in the pigs from farm a, reducing the discrimination between results for the two sets of sera. this is paradoxical, given that the use of specific recombinant antigens like bhlp <dig>  should reduce potential cross-reactivity  <cit> . however, the gene for bhp <dig>  has been identified in b. innocens strain b256t  <cit> , and the presence of such strains might generate false positive cross-reactivities and reduce the discriminatory power of this elisa. even more problematic is the recent report that the gene encoding bhlp <dig>  could not be amplified from  <dig>  recent german isolates of b. hyodysenteriae  <cit> . although recently lobova et al reported that immunoblotting using bhlp <dig>  in conjunction with culturing method was a valuable tool for detecting swine herds latently infected with b. hyodysenteria  <cit> , the specificity of the bhlp <dig>  is still not clear. hence further work is required to identify alternative antigenic surface exposed proteins specific to b. hyodysenteriae that can be used in serological assays. recombinant forms of such proteins are useful as plate-coating antigens as they are easier to prepare as a standard product than are wc preparations.

the change in igm also demonstrated great magnitude in the experimental animals after exposure to b. hyodysenteriae. the performance of the igm elisa systems based on wc and bhlp <dig>  was then evaluated using the field samples in the cohort study. however, igm levels to both antigens demonstrated a significant increase at  <dig> week on farm a, indicating that igm is less specific than igg in providing evidence of exposure to the spirochaete.

to further explore the suitability of elisa systems using wc and bhlp <dig>  as herd tests, swine sera were collected from the herds with high health status and herds with a history of sd. a sample size of  <dig> animals within each herd was chosen to achieve an appropriate confidence of 95% of detecting an individual infected pig based on the previous study  <cit> . due to considerable variation in antibody response observed in the non-infected pigs, the value of three standard deviations above the mean was applied as diagnostic thresholds. although the high stringent cut-off value  might prioritize the test specificity and compromise the test sensitivity, the preliminary study in a clinical setting demonstrated that the assays based on both antigens could discriminate positive herds from negative herds. certainly testing more herds is required to accurately estimate the assay performance with more reliable cut-off established from a large population of non-infected herds in the future.

additionally meat juice has been reported to be a useful alternative to serum as a source of antibodies, and has been used in a number of sero-epidemiological studies and in surveillance for porcine infections  <cit> . a comparative study on serum and meat juice samples from the same source of herds was undertaken using the elisa systems described above. the assays based on meat juice achieved equivalent sensitivity and specificity as serum specimens . it was recognized that the current study could be strengthened by including more samples from negative and positive farms, but nevertheless it was clear from the results that meat juice from some pigs on the infected farms had elevated igg and igm levels to b. hyodysenteriae. this finding supported our hypothesis that testing meat juice for specific antibodies could be used as a surveillance tool to help detect farms infected with b. hyodysenteriae. the noteworthy, in both serum and meat juice tests, the igg wc elisa had 100% sensitivity and specificity as a herd test and gave a high detection rate. this finding further confirmed the suitability of using a igg elisa coated with b. hyodysenteriae wc antigen as an aid in the diagnosis of infected herds.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the three independent studies, igg elisas using either wc or bhlp <dig>  as plate-coating antigens were shown to be useful for monitoring the dynamics of b. hyodysenteriae infection in grower pigs. of the two antigens, the wc preparation tended to give better discrimination between pigs from infected and non-infected farms. as recombinant proteins are easier to produce and standardize than are wc preparations, it would be useful to identify and evaluate additional immunogenic surface proteins of b. hyodysenteriae as elisa antigens. meat juice samples collected from pigs on infected farms were shown to contain specific antibodies to b. hyodysenteriae, and analysis of this material could be incorporated into routine health surveillance. however, the present study should be considered as a preliminary one and further investigation is required to confirm the findings, particularly with a large number of samples.
