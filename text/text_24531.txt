BACKGROUND
both geological events and climatic fluctuations usually influence genetic variation distribution in populations and species. the uplifting of mountain systems and the development of river systems may form vicariance between populations, resulting in genetic diversification and even speciation  <cit> . china has a complex topography; the terrain gradually slopes from west to east forming a flight of three steps  <cit> . the first step consists of the tibetan plateau, with an average elevation of over  <dig>  m above sea level. the second step includes the yun-gui, loess, and inner mongolia plateaus, the tarim, jungar, and sichuan basins, and varies from  <dig> – <dig>  m in elevation. the third step, dropping to 500– <dig>  m in elevation, refers to the vast area in the east of the great hinggan ridge-taihang-wushan-xuefeng mountains and mainly consists of hills and plains  <cit> .

these steps remain geographically and ecologically dynamic; geomorphic evolution is responsible for the isolation and differentiation of many plant and animal populations  <cit> . for example, the geographic division of two lineages of chinese gecko  coincides with a boundary consisting of the qinling and taihang mountains, suggesting a historical vicariance pattern  <cit> .

global cyclic fluctuations from the pliocene and through the quaternary have resulted in periodic habitat expansions and contractions of species ranges, shaping the species distributions and their genetic patterns  <cit> . species ranges typically shifted southwards during cold glacial periods and northwards during warm interglacial ones  <cit> . quaternary climatic fluctuations and associated habitat expansions and contractions have been investigated extensively in extant organisms  <cit> . in contrast, the impacts of more ancient climatic changes, as far back as the pliocene, have been largely neglected despite remarkable shifts in global climate and continental ecosystems  <cit> . studies have demonstrated that quaternary glacial climatic oscillations are too recent to explain many of the deep genetic divergences observed today  <cit> .

pliocene climatic oscillations have also occurred in china  <cit> . during cold periods, continental china was mainly affected by cold air masses and glaciation developed in high mountains. in warm periods, the continental climate was dominated by warm humid air masses, causing glaciers in high mountains to retreat. similar to current global warming projections, warm humid periods had the potential to eliminate cold-adapted organisms  <cit> . individual population ranges likely shifted upwards along altitudinal gradients  <cit> . nevertheless, our knowledge of the genetic consequences of pliocene climatic change in china remains sparse.

the chinese minnow  is a small riverine cyprinid widely distributed in east asia. they live in cold, running, or still  waters, generally inhabiting stream headwaters at high altitude  <cit> . in china, this species occurs in second- and third-step geomorphic areas. they also occur in the temperate regions of southern china where the average annual temperature is approximately 18°c  <cit> . therefore, this is an excellent bioindicator species for low-temperature water and a good model species for studying freshwater fish biogeographic patterns in china because of their typically low dispersal ability and restriction to small mountaintop habitats. it has been suggested that high-altitude populations of r. oxycephalus in southern china are quaternary glacial relics  <cit> ; however, this claim remains unsubstantiated because no phylogeographic studies have been conducted on this minnow to date.

in the present study, we employed mitochondrial dna  and nuclear dna  markers to test hypotheses on the drivers of biogeographic processes in r. oxycephalus. large-scale sampling allowed us to test hypotheses on the evolutionary history and population demographics of r. oxycephalus, to determine:  whether or not three steps orogenesis provided different ecological regions that led to high- and low-altitude populations and  if quaternary climatic fluctuations resulted in their present geographic distribution in southern china. finally, we also assessed the level of genetic diversity for all populations and proposed suitable conservation strategies.

dna extraction, pcr amplification, and sequencing
total genomic dna was extracted from muscle tissue following the salt-extraction methods of tang et al.  <cit> . the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene  was amplified for all samples with primers the gluf  and thrr   <cit> . two cytb sequences from japan were also added to the present study . the nuclear recombinase activating gene  <dig>  encodes components of the recombinase involved in immunoglobin recombination and t-cell receptor genes and appears as conserved single copies in all vertebrates examined to date  <cit> . partial rag <dig> sequences  were obtained from a subset of samples consisting of  <dig> individuals with the primers rag2-108f  and rag2-1324r   <cit> . amplifications were performed in a 60-μl reaction volume containing 6 μl of 10 × pcr buffer, 30–50 ng genomic dna, 1 μl of each primer ,  <dig>  μl of dntps , and  <dig>  u taq dna polymerase. sterile water was added to reach the final volume. reactions took place in the following program: an initial denaturation at 94°c for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°c for 30 s, annealing at 52–58°c for 45 s, extension at 72°c for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°c for 8 min. pcr products were sent to commercial sequencing companies  for purifying and then sequenced in both directions with bigdye™ terminator cycle sequencing kit on an abi prism®  <dig> dna analyzer . the same pcr primers were used for sequencing.

sequence analysis
a total of  <dig> cytb and  <dig> rag <dig> sequences have been newly sequenced in this study. multiple alignments of sequences were performed using clustal x  <cit>  and subsequently checked by eye in seaview  <cit> . the nucleotide sequence compositions were calculated in paup* v.  <dig> b10a  <cit> . sequence variations were calculated in mega  <dig>   <cit> . nuclear gene sequences containing more than one ambiguous site were resolved using phase version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , for which the input files were prepared using seqphase  <cit> . recombination tests for detecting the longest non-recombining region for nuclear loci were conducted in imgc  <cit> . identical haplotypes were collapsed in dnasp  <dig>   <cit> . newly determined sequences were submitted to genbank  .

phylogenetic analysis
phylogenetic relationships among mitochondrial haplotypes were reconstructed using bayesian inference , maximum likelihood , and maximum parsimony  approaches. selection of the best-fit nucleotide substitution models was based on codon position using the akaike information criterion in jmodeltest  <dig>   <cit> . for bi and ml analysis, the most appropriate model of nucleotide substitution was . bi analysis was carried out in mrbayes v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . four simultaneous markov chains were run for  <dig> million generations sampling every  <dig> generations using two independent analyses in parallel runs. the average standard deviation of split frequencies reached a value below  <dig> , the potential scale reduction factor  value approached  <dig> . after the first  <dig>  sampled trees were discarded as burn-in, 50% majority-rule consensus trees with posterior probability values for each node were obtained. ml analysis was conducted with the best model of nucleotide substitution  in phyml  <dig>   <cit> . nodal support values were estimated from  <dig> nonparametric bootstrap replicates. mp analysis was implemented in paup  <dig> b10a  <cit> . heuristic searches with tree-bisection-reconnection were executed for  <dig>  random addition replicates with all characters treated as unordered and equally weighted. we constructed the bi tree using rag <dig> alleles under the same settings as for cytb, except for model of substitution . furthermore, the network  <dig> . <dig>  program  <cit>  was employed to construct median-joining  networks to visualize relationships among haplotypes, using the mp calculation set to the default parameters.

divergence time estimates
for divergence time estimation, the molecular clock was evaluated using a two-cluster test in the lintree program  <cit> . sequences that showed significantly different substitution rates were excluded from further analysis. to estimate the divergence time and ancestral distribution of the extant matrilines, we used a coalescent time estimation method in beast v  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . major matriline divergence times were estimated using a yule speciation tree prior. because of the absence of fossil or geological data for calibrations, divergence times were estimated under the strict-clock model. based on the mitochondrial cytb data, a range of mutation rates  were adopted, as they have been widely employed for mitochondrial cytb gene analysis in cyprinid fish  <cit> . two fixed mutation rates of 1% and 2% were conducted and from these an average divergence time was generated. the credibility interval included the lower limit from the 1% clock and the upper limit from the 2% clock. analyses were performed for  <dig> million generations while sampling every  <dig> th tree, and the first 10% of trees sampled were treated as burn-in. the effective sample size for parameter estimates and convergence was checked with tracer  <dig>   <cit> . figtree v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  was used to display summarized and annotated phylogenetic trees with a molecular clock constraint yielded by beast.

population genetic analysis
diversity estimations for both pooled and individual population datasets were calculated in dnasp, including the number of haplotypes , haplotype diversity , and nucleotide diversity . the mean divergence among haplotypes and divergence between matrilines were calculated by an uncorrected p-distances model as implemented in mega, standard errors were estimated by bootstrapping using  <dig>  replicates. pairwise population differentiation was estimated by computing pairwise Φst for the cytb data between populations having more than  <dig> samples in arlequin  <dig>   <cit> . to investigate the level of genetic variation between populations, a two-level hierarchical analysis of molecular variance  was performed. the significance was assessed by  <dig>  random permutations.

the plausibility of an isolation-by-distance scenario was explicitly tested by mantel’s tests in arlequin to analyze the relationships between genetic  and geographical  distances between sampling localities.

demographic history
three methods were used with the cytb data to trace the demographic history of matrilines b <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig>  matriline a was excluded form demographic analysis because of the small sample size. first, tajima’s d  <cit>  and fu’s fs  <cit>  were used to check for neutral evolution of the mtdna in arlequin. in the neutrality test, we assessed significance by generating null distributions from  <dig>  coalescent simulations; significantly negative values indicated population expansion. second, mismatch distributions  <cit>  were calculated in arlequin to test for signals of demographic expansion. for a population undergoing exponential growth, its mismatch distribution should fit a smooth unimodal curve  <cit> . the significance of sum of squared deviations  and raggedness indices were carried out by bootstrap resampling . third, extended bayesian skyline plot ebsp;  <cit>  were implemented in the program beast to describe demographic history by assessing the time variation of effective population size. this analysis was performed using the gtr+i+r substitution model and no partition into codon positions. the coalescent tree prior was specified as the extended bayesian skyline plot. the strict-clock model with mutation rates of 1% per million years was used. the analysis was performed for  <dig> million generations. the remaining settings were in default mode.

morphological differentiation analysis
the ratio of caudal peduncle depth to head length  and caudal peduncle length to depth  are key morphometric variables for discrimination between r. oxycephalus and r. lagowaskii  <cit> . we measured these two variables for  <dig> populations  of r. oxycephalus and the xinyang  population using digital calipers . variation of these key morphometric characteristics among the three matrilines  was subsequently assessed by anova. tukey’s honest significant difference was employed for post-hoc pairwise comparisons. the sample sizes for morphological analysis were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for matrilines a, b, and c, respectively.

RESULTS

matrilineal genealogy and ndna allele tree
based on the mtdna data, three methods  yielded congruent topologies and they consistently supported three matrilines . matriline a, at the base of the tree, corresponded to two individuals from japan and samples from xinyang  belonging to the huaihe river. it exhibited high divergence from the other matrilines . matriline b, sister to matriline c, contained two submatrilines, one on the east of the middle yellow river  and the other on the west of the same river and the upper yangtze river tributaries . matriline c was also subdivided into two submatrilines but with poor node support. submatriline c <dig> was composed of individuals from liaohe river and haihe river streams in northern china, while submatriline c <dig> was widely distributed, mainly in the middle and lower yangtze river streams and in zhejiang province, southern china.figure  <dig>

molecular diversity and genetic structure
the overall cytb haplotype  and nucleotide  diversities in all samples were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. the number of haplotypes , h, and π varied among populations . the gaizhou population , which exhibited the highest h value, contained haplotypes from submatriline c <dig>  the mianchi population  had the highest π value, which corresponded to the co-occurrence of haplotypes from submatrilines b <dig> and b <dig>  in contrast,  <dig> populations  each contained only a single haplotype. the two-level amova suggested that r. oxycephalus was highly geographically structured:  <dig> % of the genetic variation was attributed to differentiation among populations and this was highly significant . all pairwise Φst values were statistically significant, varying from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . genetic divergence varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> % among matrilines a, b, and c, and from  <dig>  to  <dig> % between submatrilines b1-b <dig> and c1-c <dig> .table  <dig>

a significant positive correlation was found between geographical distance and genetic divergence among populations . however, some populations  were genetically distinct despite their geographical proximity. these populations are distributed on opposite sides of the same mountains.

for submatriline b <dig>  tajima’s d and fu’s fs were negative but not significant . however, values of ssd and raggedness index did not reject the hypothesis of sudden expansion and the b <dig> mismatch distribution was unimodal . extended bayesian skyline plots  suggested that the effective population size was slowly increasing . for submatrilines b <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig>  population expansions were not supported in neutrality tests  and the mismatch analyses significantly rejected the expansion hypothesis. however, the ebsp suggested a decline followed by a steep increase in effective population size for submatrilines c <dig> and c <dig>  and a steep decline for submatriline b <dig> . therefore, in all matrilines there was ambiguity in the demographic scenarios suggested by all three methods.table  <dig>

the anova analysis showed that two key taxonomic characteristics varied significantly among the three matrilines . for cpd/hl, there was no significant difference between matrilines a and b . however, significant pair-wise distinctions were detected between matrilines a and c and between matrilines b and c . for cpl/cpd, matriline a values differed significantly from those of b and c , but there was no significant difference between matrilines b and c .

discussion
deep matriline divergence and implication of cryptic subspecies
phylogenetic analysis based on cytb revealed three matrilines : these are highly consistent with the geographic structure of the r. oxycephalus range. matriline a was first to split from the other two and exhibits high divergence from them. the taihang-wushan mountains seem to act as dividing lines between matrilines b and c. further divergence occurred between populations in matriline b  and c . the ndna phylogenetic and network analysis revealed a deep genetic divergence analogous to mtdna .

there is a deep genetic divergence between matriline a and the other matrilines for cytb . compared with other cyprinid fishes, this amount of divergence has been attributed to subspecies-level differences  <cit> . the rag <dig> tree results were consistent with those from the cytb tree, matriline a is basal in the bi tree and the mj network, indicating that matriline a is most distant from the others . we also sequenced some cytb and rag <dig> sequences from other closed rhynchocypris species . the results revealed that matriline a is a distinct monophyletic group and forms a sister relationship with r. oxycephalus. furthermore, samples from xinyang , representing matriline a in our samples, are morphologically distinct from the other populations in taxonomically relevant ratios. therefore, we suggest that matriline a represents a cryptic subspecies, which may be geographically restricted to japan and parts of china including the huaihe river. although japan is currently separated from eastern china, studies have proposed that these regions most likely had the same freshwater ichthyofauna during the miocene and pliocene  <cit> .

the cytb sequences analysis carried out in our study revealed three distinct evolutionary lineages in r. oxycephalus. do these major lineages correspond to two or three distinct species? compared with the general definitions of five different groups of candidate species  <cit> , all uncorrected p-distances between the r. oxycephalus lineages reached a value associated with subspecies divergences . additionally, morphological differences  were also observed between the major lineages . however, the relationship between matrilines b and c is not completely supported by the rag <dig> gene data, but matriline a is indeed distinct from the others . therefore, the hypothesis of matrilines b and c being distinct subspecies or even species requires further research.

geologically driven divergence between matrilines b and c
the deep divergence observed between matrilines b and c likely reflects long-term isolation and ecological differences between high- and low-elevation regions, which is probably associated with china’s complex geological history. as indicated in figure  <dig>  matriline b populations are mainly distributed in high-altitude areas; while matriline c occurs in the lowland regions. the taihang-wushan mountains, part of the demarcation line for the second- and third-step geomorphic areas in china  <cit> , separate matrilines b and c. therefore, r. oxycephalus divergence is likely associated with the orogenesis of china’s three steps. geological evidence indicates that recent large-scale intense uplift of the qinghai-tibetan plateau took place during the pliocene  <dig>  mya  <cit> , contributing to the formation of three steps land features  <cit> . during this period, new habitats and different ecological regions may have been created leading to upper and lower populations. these ecological differences may have resulted in high levels of divergence between matrilines b and c, fostering the accumulation of autapomorphic mutations. the mean estimate of divergence between matrilines b and c was  <dig>  mya , suggesting that the speciation event occurred at approximately the same time as the geological event. similar effects have been reported for several species of plants  <cit>  and animals  <cit> . based on the cytb gene sequences, he and chen  <cit>  suggested that the highly specialized schizothoracine fishes may have originated in the early pliocene and the major cladogenetic events in this species are closely correlated with marked environmental changes caused by the violent upheaval of the plateau. the geographic division between two chinese gecko  lineages also coincides with the qinling and taihang mountains boundary, suggesting a historical vicariance pattern. the orogeny of the qinling mountains may have launched the independent lineage divergence  <cit> . thus, barriers to gene flow produced by the complex geological history appear to be responsible for driving the high level of species diversity in the mountains of china.

pliocene climate fluctuation driven split between submatrilines c <dig> and c2
there is a  <dig> % mtdna difference between submatrilines c <dig> and c <dig> . this high level of divergence likely reflects long-term isolation between the two submatrilines. our molecular clock analysis estimated that submatriline c <dig> split from c <dig> approximately  <dig>  mya , corresponding to the pliocene warming   <cit> . this warming period was preceded by an extensive cooling   <cit> . during the colder period, matriline c may have extended its range southwards to southern china, resulting in a widespread distribution of the species. the subsequent warming then resulted in the split of matriline c into submatrilines c <dig> and c2; submatriline c <dig> is now distributed in cold northern china, while c <dig> remains in southern china. similar effects have been reported in speckled dace  in western north america  <cit> . in asian salamanders , all major intraspecific lineages originated before the quaternary period and pre-quaternary climate change played an important role in the formation of regional biodiversity  <cit> .

after the split of submatrilines c <dig> and c <dig>  intraspecific divergence may have been intensified through cyclical climatic fluctuations in the pleistocene, which also facilitated the relatively wide distribution of r. oxycephalus in southern china. similar processes have been described in terrestrial montane organisms. thus, our conclusion is inconsistent with the hypothesis that r. oxycephalus populations in southern china are quaternary glacial relics in the high-altitude mountains of this region  <cit> .

species-level genetic diversity and structure
chinese r. oxycephalus populations are highly genetically diverse. for the cytb gene in all samples, there were  <dig>  parsimony informative sites and the most variable sites occurred in different haplotypes. amova analysis revealed that  <dig> % of the genetic variation was attributed to differentiation among populations. in contrast, genetic diversity within populations was very low and  <dig> populations possessed a single haplotype despite typically analyzing over  <dig> fish per population. these populations may have had extremely small founding populations. a similar phenomenon has been reported in quasipaa boulengeri, a montane stream-dwelling frog, where 85% of the haplotypes only occurred in a single location and  <dig> populations out of  <dig> had zero haplotype and nucleotide diversity  <cit> . high levels of genetic diversity among populations and low levels within populations may commonly occur in montane streams  <cit> . in these species, local extinctions may considerably impoverish species genetic diversity via the loss of unique haplotypes.

the genetic structure of a species is greatly influenced by the palaeogeographical history of the region that comprises its geographical range. in the present study, mtdna analysis suggested that r. oxycephalus was geographically restricted to local montane areas. approximately 97% of the haplotypes are unique for their respective populations. the majority of genetic variance was seen at the population level and was correlated with geographic distance; more distant sites within the hydrological network were more genetically differentiated. in addition to complex topological changes, this pattern may have resulted from the isolation of populations because of specific habitat requirements. rhynchocypris oxycephalus mainly occurs in the clear cold permanent headwaters of montane streams. this specific ecological requirement results in small population sizes and restricts gene flow among populations . therefore, these populations most likely survive in isolated habitats and differentiate through genetic drift and selection.

implications for conservation
the chinese minnow currently has a wide geographical distribution in east asia and to date is ranked as ‘not threatened’. however, individual populations are small because they are restricted to stream headwaters and may be sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic threats. using ecological niche modeling, yu et al.  <cit>  predicted that climate change poses a severe threat to r. oxycephalus. the geographical distribution of this species is expected to contract with progressing climate change and become severely limited, particularly in south-eastern china. anthropogenic threats, such as deforestation, illegal fishing, and habitat destruction  may represent major threats to this species. these factors place r. oxycephalus at risk for extinction.

genetic variability is widely recognized as an important component of natural biodiversity. the maintenance of high genetic diversity could prevent the loss of a species evolutionary potential  <cit> . the distinct genetic differentiation in r. oxycephalus has important implications for the conservation of this species. however, many r. oxycephalus populations inhabit areas that are not protected. our study may serve as a guide for monitoring and developing a conservation strategy for this species. within this framework, our analyses suggest that the three matrilineal ranges  be considered individual management units. all of these require protection because of their genetic uniqueness, which includes exclusive mtdna haplotypes and private nuclear alleles.

additionally, the southern populations including those from the yangtze river, zhejiang province, and the min river demand special attention. this species is geographically restricted to local streams and many of these populations possess negligible genetic diversity. overall genetic diversity in r. oxycephalus will be reduced if these populations become extinct. climate change projections indicate severe threats to r. oxycephalus and to these southern populations in particular  <cit> . consequently, we recommend that conservation efforts should pay particular attention to areas with unique genetic information. long-term monitoring programs should also be established, irrespective of whether local population genetic diversity is high or low.

CONCLUSIONS
this study assembles a large dataset to infer r. oxycephalus phylogeographic patterns in china. the results support the hypothesis that geological events  have driven divergence between matrilines b and c. based on the molecular clock, it is unlikely that climate fluctuations during the quaternary facilitated the southwards dispersal of r. oxycephalus in matriline c and established relics in south china as postulated by zhang and chen  <cit> . pliocene cooling and warming might have resulted in the split of submatrilines c <dig> and c <dig>  notably, no genetic diversity was detected in several populations and all of these populations possessed unique genotypes. this indicates the uniqueness of local populations and calls for a special conservation concern for this species at the population level. these conclusions are based on cytb and rag <dig> gene data; analysis with additional markers would greatly enhance our understanding of this species.
