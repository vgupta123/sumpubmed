BACKGROUND
high soil boron  can affect yields of barley  across southern australia by up to 17 %  <cit> , depending on a multitude of site, seasonal and genetic factors . along with disease ratings, standard information for new barley varieties released in south australia, victoria and western australia often includes a boron tolerance rating  <cit> , allowing farmers to select varieties tolerant to high soil b. genetic variability for high b tolerance has long been known  <cit> . the most tolerant barley identified amongst breeding material in australia is the unadapted six-row north african landrace, sahara  <dig>  this genotype was accessioned in australian collections in the early 1900s  <cit> , one of a set of nine barley lines listed as sahara  <dig> – sahara  <dig>  it has been considered an important source of b tolerance for barley breeding programs over many years. four major qtl for b tolerance were identified in sahara  <dig>  in a genetic study using a doubled haploid  population derived from a cross between the south australian malting variety, clipper, and sahara  <dig>  <cit> . subsequent research to fine-map two of the regions revealed the identity of the tolerance genes hvbot <dig>   <cit>  and hvnip2; <dig>   <cit> . they encode two types of transporter that function to minimise the amount of b in barley roots. these genes have been partially characterised, but the prevalence of the tolerant alleles across australian germplasm was not known. it was also not known if there is significant diversity in hvbot <dig> and hvnip2; <dig> contributing to b tolerance, such as has been found in wheat for tabot-b <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the aims of this study were to: 1) determine the prevalence of known b tolerance alleles in australian barley germplasm; 2) develop an improved set of markers for tracking the introgression of b tolerance from sahara 3771; and 3) identify alternative sources of b tolerance in barley. this was a broad study and, although the set of germplasm assessed was not exhaustive, our data suggest that the tolerance alleles found in sahara  <dig> are rare. the significance of a qtl on chromosome 2h controlling leaf symptom expression is highlighted as a target for future breeding and selection for b tolerance in barley.

RESULTS
tolerance to high soil b in the barley landrace sahara  <dig> has been attributed to four major qtl, on chromosomes 2h, 3h, 4h and 6h. we screened a set of  <dig> diverse barley genotypes  for variation at these loci using genomic southern analysis, which also enabled us to assess gene copy number variation. coding sequence for the genes encoding b transport proteins hvbot <dig> and hvnip2; <dig>  and which lie beneath the 4h and 6h tolerance loci, respectively, was also amplified and sequenced. in sourcing diverse germplasm to screen, we obtained seed for nine barleys accessioned in the australian grains genebank as sahara  <dig> to sahara  <dig>  our analyses suggest that the sahara accessions possess a unique set of b tolerance alleles.

genetic variation at the 4h locus 
southern analysis of the  <dig> barley genotypes revealed that the tandem hvbot <dig> gene duplication found in sahara  <dig> is rare, although other genotypes  showed a sahara-like restriction pattern without gene duplication . all nine sahara genotypes from the australian grains genebank possessed the hvbot <dig> gene duplication, and displayed similarly high b-tolerant phenotypes in hydroponic experiments .

sequencing of the coding regions of hvbot <dig> revealed seven coding sequence variants , including the clipper and sahara  hvbot <dig> alleles. eight synonymous snps were found between the clipper and sahara alleles, with no resulting amino acid changes . amino acid substitutions were found in each of the other five variants, at either one  or two  of five different locations. the alexis, morex and wi <dig> variants shared a common substitution . we have named the allelic variants bot <dig> a through to bot <dig> g, as illustrated in fig. 1a. coding sequences for the novel alleles have been lodged with genbank .fig.  <dig> genetic variation in barley at the 4h b tolerance locus . a

we compared hvbot <dig> expression levels in roots of seedlings of barley genotypes carrying the different alleles . hvbot <dig> expression was similar for all variants except for genotypes carrying the duplicated sahara allele .b), which in this experiment showed more than 200-fold higher levels of expression . multiple sequencing efforts failed to uncover any sequence differences, in either the hvbot <dig> gene or its promoter, between copies in lines carrying the hvbot <dig> duplication, or between the duplicated allele and lines containing a single copy of the sahara hvbot <dig> allele.

we identified an individual f <dig> seedling from a cross between two clipper x sahara  <dig> dh lines, which carried a chromosome with a recombination break point between the hvbot <dig> gene copies and a chromosome with an intact sahara  <dig> gene cluster. southern analysis identified homozygous recombinant progeny which likely retained only one of the copies of this gene. no sequence differences were identified between the hvbot <dig> copy in the recombinant and those in the sahara parent. we used this recombinant line to further investigate the impact of hvbot <dig> duplication on expression. levels of hvbot <dig> expression in roots of homozygous recombinant f <dig> progeny were similar to expression levels in clipper, while progeny with the full set of duplicated hvbot <dig> copies showed similar levels of hvbot <dig> expression to sahara, and the heterozygous progeny had intermediate expression .fig.  <dig> 
hvbot <dig> duplication is correlated with higher levels of hvbot <dig> expression. hvbot <dig> transcript levels  in barley roots of the parental genotypes sahara  <dig> and clipper, and in hvbot <dig> segregant classes from an f <dig> recombinant derived from a cross between two doubled haploid lines. italicised letters above the bars denote significant differences between genotypes . the f <dig> was identified as recombinant within the hvbot <dig> gene cluster, resulting in f <dig> progeny with different numbers of copies of the sahara hvbot <dig> allele. southern analysis indicated that the homozygous recombinant progeny contained only a single copy of the sahara hvbot <dig> allele. seedlings were grown for 14 days in nutrient solution with an additional 2 mm b prior to sampling. f <dig> individuals were genotyped using the closely linked xbm <dig> caps marker , to identify segregant classes



we also assessed the function of each of the variants by heterologous expression in yeast . with the exception of the haruna nijo allele , all variants conferred a similar level of tolerance to media containing high concentrations of b when expressed in yeast . clones containing the haruna nijo variant were no more tolerant to high b than empty vector control yeast, indicating that one or both of the residue substitutions in the haruna nijo hvbot <dig> allele disrupted protein function. we mutated each of the residues separately in the sahara hvbot <dig> orf and tested the two mutations in a second yeast expression experiment, which demonstrated that leucine at position  <dig> in hvbot <dig> is critical for function . by contrast, the thr541met substitution had no effect on transporter function. the cultivars haruna nijo and amagi nijo which carry the haruna nijo hvbot <dig> allele are intolerant to high b when grown in hydroponics. root b concentrations were similar to clipper, and suggested that no net efflux of b from the roots was occurring in either cultivar .

we developed a kasp™ marker to track a snp in exon  <dig> unique to sahara . the previously reported xbot <dig> marker  <cit>   was designed around a snp that is not specific to the sahara hvbot <dig> allele, but is also common to the alexis, morex, wi <dig> and haruna nijo alleles .

genetic variation at the 6h locus 
initial southern analysis of barley germplasm using a probe designed against hvnip2; <dig> identified three patterns of hybridisation. sequencing of the coding regions of hvnip2; <dig> indicated that the hvnip2; <dig> orf is very highly conserved; a single synonymous snp occurs between the alleles from clipper and sahara  <dig> . the clipper sequence variant was found in just over half of all germplasm included for sequencing. expression levels for hvnip2; <dig> in barley roots did not differ either between the two sequence variants or between the three allelic groups identified by genomic southern analysis .fig.  <dig> genetic variation in barley at the 6h b tolerance locus . a schematic of hvnip2; <dig> coding sequences from clipper and sahara showing positions of two identified snps. no other sequence variation was found among  <dig> barley genotypes. a kasptm marker assay was designed against the sahara-specific 5’utr snp. b expression levels of hvnip2; <dig> determined by q-rt-pcr, in roots of seedlings of barley genotypes classified into four haplotypes on the basis of southern and cdna sequence analyses: class  <dig>  clipper rflp, orf and uorf;  <dig>  california mariout rflp, clipper orf and uorf;  <dig>  sahara rflp and orf/ clipper uorf;  <dig>  sahara rflp, orf and uorf. refer to additional file 8: table s <dig> for a list of barley genotypes included in each class. transcript levels were normalised using the rna housekeeping genes for tubulin, gapdh and hsp <dig>  c relative translation efficiencies of a luciferase gene driven by an sp <dig> rna polymerase promoter, when 5’utr sequences from clipper and sahara hvnip2; <dig> are inserted immediately upstream of luciferase. translation efficiency was measured as luciferase activity by luminescence, and is expressed relative to the activity of sp <dig> control luciferase dna. six transcription/translation reactions were set up for each construct, and four luciferase assays recorded for each reaction. bar represents the 95 % confidence interval for the difference between clipper and sahara 5’utr sequences



a second snp, unique to the sahara accessions and located 44 bp upstream of the atg start codon in the 5’ utr, was identified in hvnip2; <dig>  at this position the thymidine base in sahara creates a short, upstream orf  encoding a translatable peptide of thirteen residues immediately upstream of, and in frame with the hvnip2; <dig> orf . we hypothesised that this uorf in sahara may interfere with hvnip2; <dig> translation, and be the principal mechanism for reduced function of hvnip2; <dig> leading to reduced b permeability and a greater tolerance to high b. the 133 bp 5’utr sequences from clipper and sahara hvnip2; <dig> were cloned into the sp <dig> vector, immediately upstream of the firefly  luciferase gene driven by the sp <dig> rna polymerase promoter. in vitro transcription/translation reactions with each construct demonstrated that the sahara 5’ utr sequence inhibited translation of the luciferase reporter gene by 43 % relative to the clipper 5’ utr sequence .

interestingly, the uorf snp was found only in sahara  <dig> and the other eight sahara accessions, suggesting that tolerance to high soil b attributable to this locus is very rare. we developed a kasp™ marker to track the sahara uorf snp in hvnip2; <dig> .

genetic variation at the 3h and 2h loci
the genetic determinants at these loci are unknown. however, a member of the bot b transporter gene family, hvbot <dig>  is located within the region of the 3h qtl controlling relative root length at high b and is considered to be a likely candidate gene  <cit>  . the hvbot <dig> sequence in sahara  <dig> is disrupted by a large deletion  beginning at the 3’ end of the cds, which may result in a loss of function. we designed two sets of primers, to amplify within and across the deletion, respectively . discriminating pcr determined that with the exception of the nine sahara accessions, the hvbot <dig> cds was intact in all tested barley genotypes. a kasp™ marker was developed to track the sahara  <dig> deletion .

the 2h qtl for b tolerance controls leaf symptom expression in the clipper x sahara  <dig> population and is located close to the centromere  <cit> . fine mapping in this region is difficult due to low recombination frequency. furthermore, within the clipper x sahara  <dig> dh population the qtl was poorly defined, largely because leaf symptoms could not be accurately assessed in lines carrying sahara alleles at the other b tolerance loci. additional background genetic effects might also contribute to an unclear phenotype in the dh lines. we identified seven dh lines that were recombinant within the 2h interval and backcrossed them to clipper. bc1f <dig> plants retaining the recombinant sahara haplotype across the 2h region but with clipper alleles at the 3h, 4h and 6h loci were selected by genotyping. evaluation of leaf symptoms of b toxicity in bc1f <dig> progeny clearly defined the interval for the 2h qtl to approximately  <dig>  cm, between the markers gbms <dig> and bmag <dig> . we tested the markers contig <dig> and g9-138c in an attempt to characterise the barley genotypes at the 2h qtl region. g9-138c appeared to associate with a b tolerance phenotype. for this marker, the sahara accessions and the line ethiopia  <dig> shared a similar restriction pattern .

prevalence and impact of b tolerance alleles in australian barley varieties
a set of  <dig> australian barley varieties included in national variety trial testing between  <dig> and  <dig> were screened for allele type at each of the four known b tolerance loci, leaf symptoms of b toxicity, and leaf b concentrations when grown in a glasshouse with an elevated supply of b. the data for each variety included in the screen are provided in additional file 7: table s <dig>  a small number of varieties were heterogeneous for either the hvnip2; <dig> or hvbot <dig> alleles, and were separated into sub-lines. the most common hvbot <dig> allele amongst the australian barley varieties was the clipper allele . the morex  and alexis  alleles were also relatively common. none of the genotypes contained the sahara hvnip2; <dig> allele on chromosome 6h or the sahara variant of hvbot <dig> on chromosome 3h.

though few in number, genotypes in the study carrying single or multiple copies of the sahara hvbot <dig> allele all had both low leaf b concentrations and few symptoms of b toxicity-induced leaf necrosis . the remaining genotypes showed no clear relationship between allele type at hvbot <dig> and either leaf symptom score or leaf b concentrations. similarly, we found no clear relationship of either b toxicity parameter to breeding origin . overall there was only a weak positive relationship between leaf symptoms of b toxicity and leaf b concentration , indicating that mechanism  other than exclusion of shoot b may be contributing to b tolerance in australian barleys.fig.  <dig> relationship between the severity of b toxicity-induced leaf necrosis and leaf b concentration for a set of current australian barley varieties. symptoms were assessed visually three times during the growth of plants to full maturity and an average score determined . the penultimate leaves from five tillers were sampled at mid-grain fill for each measurement of leaf b concentration. hvbot <dig> allele type for each variety is indicated ; open squares = sahara ; open upward triangles = alexis; open downwards triangles = morex). the dashed line indicates a weak positive, linear correlation between the two parameters 



two australian cultivars, navigator and sloop vic, have sahara  <dig> in their pedigrees and were found to contain the sahara-derived hvbot <dig> gene duplication. both cultivars have high levels of hvbot <dig> gene expression, and show tolerance to high soil b, with sloop vic bred specifically for this purpose. sloop vic was found to be genetically heterogeneous; within a single packet of seed we also identified seedlings carrying the clipper hvbot <dig> allele. we designated sublines sloop vic_a and sloop vic_b, as carrying the sahara hvbot <dig> duplication or the clipper hvbot <dig> allele, respectively. interestingly, while sloop vic_a had elevated levels of hvbot <dig> expression and reduced root b concentrations relative to sloop vic_b and the parent cultivar sloop, both sloop vic sublines showed low leaf symptoms of b toxicity . further genotyping revealed that both sloop vic_a and sloop vic_b have retained a segment from sahara chromosome 2h, carrying the gene or genes controlling leaf symptom expression.fig.  <dig> contribution of sahara-derived b tolerance alleles on chromosomes 2h and 4h to b tolerance traits in the barley cultivar sloop vic. a root b concentrations  and leaf symptoms of b toxicity  in the parental genotypes sloop and sahara, and two sloop vic sublines. subline sloop vic_a contains the multi-copy sahara hvbot <dig> allele on chromosome 4h, while sloop vic_b contains the sloop  hvbot <dig> allele. both sublines carry the 2h b tolerance allele from sahara. seedlings were grown for 13 days in solution culture . within each panel, italicised letters above the bars denote significant differences between genotypes  b semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis of hvbot <dig> gene expression in roots of sloop, sloop vic_a, sloop vic_b and sahara seedlings grown for 11 days at 3 mm b. duplicate reactions were run for each of three cdna samples for each genotype, and appear alongside each other in the image. the lower panel shows hvgap fragment amplification, to indicate template concentration variability



in the varietal screen we included genotypes parent  <dig> and ethiopia  <dig>  both containing a single copy of the sahara hvbot <dig> allele. the two genotypes have been identified in australian breeding programs to have good tolerance to high soil b. parent  <dig> was provided to us by the university of adelaide’s barley breeding program, while ethiopia  <dig> was suggested for testing by breeders in western australia. in our screening parent  <dig> and ethiopia  <dig> also had both low leaf b concentrations and few leaf symptoms of b toxicity . although q-rt-pcr and semi-q-rt-pcr experiments did not detect sizeable differences in hvbot <dig> expression between the clipper and single-copy sahara variants , we could not rule out a link between the presence of a single copy of the sahara hvbot <dig> allele and a b tolerance phenotype. to determine the contribution of the sahara hvbot <dig> allele to b tolerance in these genotypes, we generated f <dig> populations from the crosses parent  <dig> × clipper and ethiopia  <dig> × clipper, and assessed leaf symptoms of b toxicity . genetic segregation analysis did not reveal linkage between b tolerance determined by leaf symptom expression and the hvbot <dig> allele in either population . we developed a discriminating kasp™ assay  around sequence polymorphism between clipper and the b tolerant parents of these populations, within the region on chromosome 2h associated with b tolerance in sahara. using this marker assay, we found an association between genotype at 2h and b tolerance in the ethiopia  <dig> × clipper f <dig> segregants . f <dig> seedlings with a homozygous ethiopia  <dig> genotype had, on average,  <dig>  % leaf necrosis on the first leaf. this was less than half the level of necrosis estimated on leaves of seedlings with a homozygous clipper genotype, and a reduction of 33 % compared to heterozygous seedlings . in the parent 19 × clipper f <dig> population there was no association between the 2h kasp™ marker assay and a b tolerance phenotype.fig.  <dig> a single copy of the sahara hvbot <dig> allele on chromosome 4h does not contribute to b tolerance in barley. a semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis of hvbot <dig> expression in roots of clipper, parent  <dig> and ethiopia  <dig> seedlings. each sample is derived from a single seedling grown in nutrient solution containing an additional 3 mm b for 15 days. the lower panel shows hvgap fragment amplification, to indicate template concentration variability. + = positive control using hvgap pcr product as template; − = water control. b distribution of percentage leaf necrosis in f <dig> progeny derived from the crosses parent 19 × clipper  and ethiopia 756 × clipper . seedlings were grown for 15 days in nutrient solution containing 3 mm b. average necrosis for each parent is also indicated. c leaf necrosis of f <dig> plants in the two populations segregating for hvbot <dig> allele  and a kasptm marker linked to the 2h b tolerance locus . in all panels, the parent  <dig> or ethiopia allele is represented by a, and the clipper allele represented by b. the boundaries of the boxes indicate 75th and 25th centiles, lines within mark the median, bars above and below the boxes indicate 90th and 10th centiles, and outliers are shown as circles. the percentage variation  explained in each population by marker genotype is also shown



in our varietal screen, several other barley cultivars also showed both low leaf symptoms of b toxicity and low leaf b concentrations, including fleet, capstan and buloke . we phenotyped a barley dh population  derived from reciprocal crosses of fleet with commander. qtl analysis failed to reveal an association between leaf symptoms of b toxicity and any of the known b tolerance loci . thus, the chromosomal regions responsible for b tolerance observed in parent  <dig>  fleet and other cultivars with lower levels of tolerance remain unknown, and do not appear to correspond to any of the b tolerance qtl found in sahara  <dig> 

discussion
the identities of two genes conferring tolerance to high soil b in barley have been determined  <cit> . one encodes hvnip2; <dig>  a transport protein belonging to the nip family of aquaporins, and is found on chromosome 6h. the other is on chromosome 4h and encodes a different kind of transporter, hvbot <dig>  the tolerant alleles for both genes are present in a set of barley accessions from north africa named sahara, including the well-studied genotype sahara  <dig>  a genetic study using a population derived from an intolerant barley variety, clipper, and sahara  <dig>  identified four chromosome locations associated with b tolerance, with all of the favourable alleles coming from sahara  <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we investigated the prevalence of these four alleles in barley germplasm, and the allelic diversity of hvbot <dig> and hvnip2; <dig>  amongst the studied germplasm, we found that the sahara lines contain a rare set of tolerance alleles, including a tandem duplication of hvbot <dig> , a critical 5’utr snp in the coding sequences of hvnip2; <dig> , a deletion in the gene hvbot <dig> that is located under the 3h tolerance locus, and a rare haplotype across the 2h qtl region.

tolerance due to hvbot <dig>  was originally attributed to either greater functionality of the transporter as a result of sequence differences between the sahara and clipper hvbot <dig> coding sequences, or higher levels of expression  <cit> . in addition to promoter sequence differences, tandem duplication of hvbot <dig> in the genome of sahara has created an estimated four copies. our study indicates that this duplication occurred relatively recently in barley evolution, and is rare. southern analysis showed that the duplication is only present in sahara  <dig>  eight other genotypes also accessioned with the sahara name, and two australian cultivars that contain sahara  <dig> in their pedigree. sequence analysis of many genotypes in this study also revealed that the original published hvbot <dig> sequence for clipper contained a sequencing error. there are in fact no residue differences between the alleles from clipper and sahara  <dig>  and both alleles confer a similar level of b tolerance to yeast when heterologously expressed . all hvbot <dig> sequences lodged with genbank have been amended and updated accordingly. thus, differences between the two alleles are entirely attributable to expression level differences.

we identified seven hvbot <dig> cds alleles in total. only one of these, found in two japanese cultivars haruna nijo and amagi nijo, showed reduced function when expressed in yeast. this is due to a residue substitution at position  <dig> in the non-functional haruna nijo allele, of histidine for leucine . all single-copy hvbot <dig> alleles were expressed at similarly low levels, including the single-copy sahara hvbot <dig> allele . genomic sequencing of a number of single-copy sahara hvbot <dig> genotypes failed to identify any sequence differences between the single-copy and multi-copy sahara alleles, or between copies present in sahara. moreover, a line derived from the clipper x sahara  <dig> dh population and with a recombination within the hvbot <dig> gene cluster, showed a dependency of hvbot <dig> gene expression level on the number of sahara hvbot <dig> copies present . we conclude that the increased expression of hvbot <dig> found in sahara is due to the duplication of this gene. a number of other specific examples of gene copy number expansion occurring through evolution have been described in plant genomes, which have also resulted in increased gene expression . recent whole genome analyses have revealed that copy number variation is common in plants, and appears to be biased towards genes involved in abiotic and biotic stress responses  <cit> .

further, we propose that duplication of the sahara hvbot <dig> allele is responsible for b tolerance at the 4h locus. segregation analysis in two independent f <dig> barley populations  failed to demonstrate linkage between the presence of a single copy of the sahara hvbot <dig> allele and b tolerance as determined by leaf symptom expression . by contrast, in the original genetic study the duplicated hvbot <dig> allele from sahara was associated with leaf symptom development, as well as a number of other traits associated with b tolerance  <cit> .

we also examined diversity in coding sequence and gene expression level for hvnip2; <dig>  the gene underlying a major qtl in sahara  <dig> on chromosome 6h  <cit> , revealed that the hvnip2; <dig> sequences were highly conserved amongst the studied germplasm. we identified only two snps in coding sequence of this gene; one synonymous snp that was present in around half of the genotypes examined and could not be related to a b tolerance phenotype, and a second snp in the 5’utr that was unique to the set of nine sahara accessions . we propose that the 5’utr snp is causative of b tolerance in sahara. an in vitro transcription/translation assay showed reduced luciferase activity in the presence of the 5’utr derived from sahara hvnip2; <dig> , suggesting that a small uorf created by the sahara 5’utr snp interferes with translation of hvnip2; <dig>  in our previous study we detected a modest reduction in hvnip2; <dig> transcript levels in root tissues of b-treated sahara  <dig> compared to clipper  <cit> . however, in broadening the analysis of expression to a wider range of genotypes, we were not able to reproduce these differences . future experiments to quantify active protein levels in roots of sahara and other, intolerant barley genotypes will help to confirm if the uorf in sahara inhibits hvnip2; <dig> translation. upstream orfs are common elements of plant transcript sequences and have been shown to mediate translation for a number of genes , including transcription factors  <cit>  and enzymes involved in polyamine biosynthesis  <cit> .

it has been suggested that when using sahara as a breeding parent, there may be linkage drag of unfavourable traits together with the 4h allele, or pleiotropic effects of the 4h tolerance allele in different backgrounds  <cit> . however, we identified two released barley varieties carrying the 4h allele from sahara, navigator and sloop vic , demonstrating there are unlikely to be severe penalties in either yield or quality traits associated with the introgression of the hvbot <dig> gene duplication. we investigated by genotype analysis the extent of the sahara-derived 4h segment in navigator , and estimate it to cover a region of at least 14 cm. while developed for cultivation in higher rainfall, long-season environments not typically associated with b toxicity, navigator consistently shows low levels of leaf symptom expression when challenged with high b .

the cultivar sloop vic was specifically selected for b tolerance  <cit> . we identified genetic heterogeneity for the 4h locus in this variety , but also the presence of a chromosomal segment from sahara that includes the 2h b tolerance allele. the two other tolerance alleles from sahara  were not retained in sloop vic. our findings suggest that the 2h allele is highly useful for imparting b tolerance. we also identified another unadapted six-row barley, ethiopia  <dig>  as an alternative source of the 2h tolerance allele. ethiopia  <dig> shares the same haplotype for a number of markers across the 2h interval with sahara, including a rare g9-138c allele. segregation analysis in a population derived from ethiopia  <dig> crossed with clipper revealed an association between the critical 2h region in ethiopia  <dig> and leaf symptoms of b toxicity . in an alternative population derived from parent  <dig> and clipper the same region was not linked with b tolerance.

CONCLUSIONS
this study of allelic diversity for the four known boron tolerance loci revealed that sahara  <dig> has a unique set of boron tolerance genes, rare amongst germplasm. it allowed us to identify the causative features of two of the genes responsible for b tolerance in sahara. these are a tandem duplication of hvbot <dig> and a short, upstream open reading frame in the coding sequences of hvnip2; <dig>  our findings facilitate the development of markers for tracking b tolerance in barley with greater specificity, and we designed three kasp™ marker assays for tracking tolerance derived from sahara. our detection of the 2h locus in ethiopia  <dig> is the first reported validation of the sahara  <dig> b tolerance qtl in another population.

the genetic locations controlling b tolerance in parent <dig>  as well as lower levels of tolerance in cultivars such as fleet, buloke and capstan that were observed in our study and in the field by others  <cit> , remain unknown; selection for b tolerance derived from these sources can only be made on the basis of phenotype. however, the genotypes ethiopia  <dig> and sloop vic may be used in breeding programs as sources of b tolerance attributable to a significant qtl for leaf symptom expression on chromosome 2h, and may be valuable alternatives to sahara.
