BACKGROUND
pemphigus vulgaris  is a severe autoimmune blistering skin disorder due to loss of integrity of normal intercellular attachments within the epidermis and mucosal epithelium. strong association of pv to the major histocompatibility complex  class ii alleles drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig> have been reported in the literature  <cit>  with over 95% of pv patients possessing one or both of these alleles  <cit> . the molecular basis and immunological consequences of this dual hla association has thus far not been elucidated. the target antigen of pv, desmoglein   <dig>  is a 130-kda transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the cadherin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules  <cit> . in the early stage of disease, patients demonstrate autoimmunity only to dsg <dig> and develop mucosal blisters; while at the later stage, patients exhibit non-cross-reactive immunity to both dsg <dig> and dsg <dig>  <cit> . despite several reports of t-cell specificities within dsg <dig>  <cit> , the number is limited and the role of t-cells in the pathogenesis of pv remains poorly understood.

bioinformatic tools are now commonly used in facilitating t-cell epitope discovery  <cit> . computational methods for predicting mhc-binding peptides include procedures based on sequence motifs  <cit> , quantitative matrices  <cit> , decision trees  <cit> , artificial neural networks  <cit> , hidden markov models  <cit>  and support vector machines  <cit> . however, despite recent advances in sequence-based predictive techniques, effective models for drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig> have been lacking, mainly due to the paucity of sufficient peptides as training data  <cit>  as well as register-shifts   <cit>  and polymorphisms in the binding registers . to date, few prediction techniques for mhc class ii molecules have been developed using three-dimensional models as the dual issues of model quality and discrimination technique must be addressed  <cit> .

our strategy for prediction of t-cell epitopes involves the three-dimensional modeling of peptide/mhc complexes using a hybrid docking approach that integrates the strengths of monte carlo simulations and homology modeling  <cit> . in an earlier study, we have successfully discriminated disease-implicated from non-disease implicated and protective alleles in pv based on structural interaction rules  <cit> . a complementary scoring function has now been developed for effective identification of drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig> epitopes. we investigated the t-cell epitope repertoire of the entire dsg <dig> glycoprotein and show the existence of multiple extracellular and intracellular specificities within the dsg <dig> self-antigen. further analysis reveal that drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig> share similar specificities by binding peptides at different core recognition regions. these data provide a molecular rationale for the association of pv to two distinct hla molecules and impact our understanding of the mechanism of hla mediated control of disease.

RESULTS
drb1* <dig> predictive model
the drb1* <dig> model shows excellent correlation with experimental binding affinities . the accuracy of the prediction model was further evaluated using  peptides with experimental ic <dig> values obtained from biochemical studies and  dsg <dig> peptides with t-cell proliferation values obtained from functional studies.

three threshold binding energy values  that define levels of specificities suitable for practical applications  <cit>  were used to evaluate the accuracy of the drb1* <dig> prediction model on the biochemical dataset  – lmh ; mh  and h . the results indicate that, overall, our drb1* <dig> peptide-binding models are highly accurate . sp =  <dig>  offers high-sensitivity predictions, whereas sp =  <dig>  results in very few false positives but fewer true positives. the prediction results for our model were consistent with expected binding patterns of drb1* <dig> peptides and provided a sensitivity of 70%  for drb1*0402-binding peptides.

next, the predictive performance of the drb1* <dig> model was tested on the functional dataset of  <dig> peptides  with experimental t-cell proliferation values/responses using the decision thresholds defined above. all experimental positives  are predicted with binding energy values of - <dig>  kj/mol or less . our simulation results indicate that drb1* <dig> can bind dsg <dig> 96– <dig> at threshold - <dig>  kj/mol  in contrast to previous qualitative study results  <cit> , albeit at a binding energy  close to the threshold. dsg <dig> 512– <dig> , dsg <dig> 78– <dig>  and dsg <dig> 96– <dig>  are predicted binders  that did not stimulate t-cell responses in the relevant experiments  <cit> . noteworthy, peptides dsg <dig> 78– <dig>  <cit>  and dsg <dig> 96– <dig>  <cit>  are fully contained within dsg <dig> 78– <dig>  and dsg <dig> 96– <dig> , both of which are experimental true positives identified in an independent study  <cit> . for dsg <dig> 78– <dig>  the preferred binding register identified by our models is 79– <dig>  which is shows a 5-residue shift in the binding register from the preferred core of 82– <dig> for dsg <dig> 78– <dig>  there is no change in the binding register observed for dsg <dig> 96– <dig> and dsg <dig> 96– <dig>  it is possible that variability in the binding register  or flanking peptide residues  lead to a change in t-cell stimulation.

dqb1* <dig> predictive model
the dqb1* <dig> prediction model correlate well with experimental data . the dqb1* <dig> model outperforms the prediction models done by rognan et al.  on training datasets of  <dig> hla-a* <dig>  and  <dig> h2-kk  peptide sequences and is consistent with our drb1* <dig> prediction model  which is trained using the same number of data points. the cross-validation coefficient q <dig> and the standard error of prediction spress are stable, with q <dig> =  <dig>  and spress =  <dig>  kj/mol. this iterative regression procedure validates the internal consistency of the scoring function in the current model, rendering it suitable for predictions on the test dataset obtained from functional studies.

the accuracy of the dqb1* <dig> prediction model was assessed on a dataset of  <dig>  dsg <dig> peptides with known t-cell proliferation values . all dqb1*0503-specific dsg <dig> stimulatory peptides can be effectively discriminated from the background at the prediction threshold - <dig>  kj/mol.

disease progression in pv
a variety of studies have demonstrated that a limited set of epitopes may be present in early disease, and intra-molecular epitope spreading may occur during disease transition at the b-cell level  <cit> . our data support the existence of multiple immunodominant t-cell epitopes that may be responsible for both disease initiation and propagation . these findings are in line with t-cell proliferation data obtained from dr <dig> and dr <dig> pv patients  <cit> . our analysis showed that the potential dsg <dig> t-cell epitope repertoire is well distributed throughout all five extracellular domains    <cit> . a large number of dqb1*0503-specific dsg <dig> peptides were predicted to exist within the transmembrane region . noteworthy,  <dig> of these peptides were found among the top  <dig> predictions , suggesting that disease initiation may begin at the transmembrane region for dr <dig> pv patients. such an initiation step would not be unique to pv as other studies have revealed disease initiation at the transmembrane region  <cit> . for drb1* <dig>  90%  of the top  <dig> predictions were predicted to exist within the ecds, suggesting that disease initiation in dr <dig> and dr <dig> pv patients may be different. although two drb1*0402-specific intracellular peptides  have been reported  <cit> , and were correctly detected by our model , relatively few intracellular peptides from the region, dsg <dig> 641– <dig>  are predicted by our methods. it remains to be determined what proportion of the predicted epitopes are actually generated via antigen processing events in vivo, or remain subdominant or "cryptic", such that they are not available for recognition during the initial immune response. it is likely that immune responses develop against secondary epitopes at later stages of disease progression, as a result of intramolecular epitope spreading, and it will be important to delineate the cascade of disease relevant epitopes in temporal sequence in future work.

drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig> cross reactivity
an in-depth analysis was performed to investigate the extent of overlap in the dsg <dig> peptide-binding repertoires of drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig>  a panel of  <dig> 15mer dsg <dig> sequences were generated using an overlapping sliding window of size  <dig> across the entire dsg <dig> glycoprotein and modeled into the binding grooves of both drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig> .

both the drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig> alleles are particularly efficient in binding dsg3-derived peptides. furthermore, a significant level of cross-reactivity was observed between drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig>  of the  <dig> overlapping 15mer peptides generated from the entire dsg <dig> glycoprotein investigated in this study,  <dig>  were predicted high-affinity binders to both alleles at threshold - <dig>  kj/mol. the computer simulation results are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  noteworthy, three previously defined immunoreactive segments of the dsg <dig> extracellular domains   <cit>  were also predicted by our models at this specific threshold. among the known dsg <dig> peptides , only  <dig>  were predicted to bind drb1* <dig> alone, consistent with our earlier qualitative results from structural studies alone  <cit> .  <dig>  were predicted to bind to both drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig>  these observations are of particular interest in that both drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig> are strongly linked to pv  <cit> , indicating that common or overlapping dominant epitopes may be responsible for inducing disease in dr <dig> and dr <dig> patients respectively.

drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig> peptide binding specificities
the basis for the high degree of cross-reactivities between drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig> was subjected to further analysis. our data support the existence of multiple binding registers within a candidate binding peptide that serve as recognition sites for drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig>  an observation previously noted for dqb1* <dig> binding peptides  <cit> . of  <dig> dsg <dig> sequences,  <dig> were predicted high-affinity binders with 76% displaying  <dig> or more registers that can be docked into the binding groove of drb1* <dig> . similar results are obtained for dqb1* <dig>  with  <dig> predicted high-affinity binders and 57% exhibiting  <dig> or more binding registers . drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig> predicted consensus binding sequences number  <dig>  a striking aspect of this analysis is that drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig> were predicted to bind a large portion of these peptides  at different binding registers. noteworthy, this difference was detected in 70%  of dsg <dig> peptides known to bind both drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig> . for example, the consensus binding peptide dsg 205– <dig> showed Δg values less than the decision threshold - <dig>  kj/mol, with the 211– <dig> and 212– <dig> registers being the preferred binding modes for drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig> respectively. we propose that drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig> share similar specificities by binding peptides at different binding registers.

CONCLUSIONS
although pv was first reported by hippocrates in  <dig> b.c., few t-cell specificities within dsg <dig> have been identified to date  <cit> , and the role of mhc and t-cells in the pathogenesis of pv still remains poorly understood. collectively, the results of this study provide interesting new insights into the pathology of pv. this is the first report of high-level of cross-reactivity between both pv-implicated alleles, drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig>  as well as the existence of a potentially large number of t-cell epitopes throughout the entire dsg <dig> ecd and transmembrane region. our data strongly indicates that multiple initial epitopes may be responsible for both disease initiation and progression. in addition, our modelling results revealed that dr <dig> and dr <dig> pv may initiate at different regions of dsg <dig>  dr <dig> pv may initiate in the ecd while dr <dig> pv may begin at the transmembrane region. it remains to be determined what proportion of predicted drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig> binders are capable of stimulating pv-implicated alleles and autoreactive t-cells. if experimental analysis reveals limited sets of predicted dsg <dig> peptides capable of eliciting functional responses, control over autoreactivity may rest at the t-cell level, rather than the level of determinant selection by mhc molecules. this will have a direct impact in the design of immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of this autoimmune disease.
