BACKGROUND
the australian sheep blowfly lucilia cuprina   is an important biological tool for medical treatment and forensic investigation. disinfected blowfly larvae are routinely used in maggot debridement therapy to promote wound healing  <cit> . the necrophagous nature of l. cuprina also makes it invaluable for forensic analysis, particularly in estimating postmortem interval  <cit> . in contrast to these beneficial roles, l. cuprina is the primary cause of flystrike in australia and new zealand  <cit> . the practice of surgical mulesing, as well as various chemical insecticides, has been used to control this formidable pest. however, fly populations often evolved resistance rapidly  <cit> . research into the genetic and biochemical mechanisms of resistance has provided some of the best examples of genetic adaptation to selection  <cit> .

despite its medical and agronomical importance and its historical status as one of the model organisms in insecticide resistance research, genomic information on l. cuprina is still relatively sparse. the haploid genome is approximately  <dig> mega bases  <cit> , which is about  <dig> times the genome size of drosophila melanogaster. polytene in situ hybridization and genetic mapping studies have determined the basic organization of its  <dig> chromosomes  <cit> . in  <dig>  weller and foster published a recombination map based on  <dig> morphological and enzyme markers, and this remains the most comprehensive linkage map of l. cuprina to date  <cit> . the chromosomal location of these markers indicates that the major linkage elements  remain relatively conserved in higher diptera  <cit> .

to combat this insect pest more intelligently, it is desirable to improve our knowledge of its genetic makeup. molecular tools have become increasingly accessible to generate large amount of information in a cost-effective manner. as the per-base cost of dna sequencing continues to fall, large-scale expressed sequence tag  projects have been accomplished in many insect species, and thousands of ests have been deposited in public databases, including higher dipteran species such as the screwworm cochliomyia hominivorax  <cit>  and the tsetse fly glossina morsitans  <cit> .

this paper describes a similar gene discovery effort to identify transcripts expressed in preadult stages . an assembly of  <dig>  unique gene clusters was produced from a total of  <dig>  ests. the protein-coding contents of this non-redundant dataset were evaluated via a series of homology analyses. we short-listed a subset of these l. cuprina genes, which showed high sequence conservation, favorable gene structure , and single correspondence in the d. melanogaster and anopheles gambiae genomes. to demonstrate their usefulness in comparative mapping, we carried out chromosomal assignment of  <dig> genes to infer inter-chromosomal rearrangements. comparison between l. cuprina and d. melanogaster revealed a high but incomplete chromosomal synteny. this newly generated est dataset is a significant step in the systematic buildup of genomic resources for this important insect in agricultural and medical entomology.

RESULTS
characteristics of est assembly
we obtained  <dig>  embryonic ,  <dig>  first-instar , and  <dig> third-instar  ests. the combined dataset  was assembled into  <dig>  unique clusters , comprising  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons . the basic features of the sequence assembly are summarized in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the majority  of the  <dig>  sequences were 500- <dig> bases in length , and the number of est reads in a contig ranged between  <dig> and  <dig>  , with an average of  <dig>  reads  per contig.

abundant transcripts in embryonic and larval stages
since the cdna libraries were not normalized, the number of reads in contigs can be used as an indication of levels of gene expression. table  <dig> summarizes information about the most abundantly expressed genes, defined as contigs containing more than  <dig> ests. the mitochondria-derived transcripts dominate this list, accounting for a total of  <dig>  ests, or 17% of the entire est collection. in comparison to the published lucilia sericata mitochondrial genome  <cit> , our ests captured  <dig> protein coding genes and the 16s rrna gene . in addition to mitochondrial transcripts, various ribosomal protein genes , 18s rrna, and elongation factors  were also amongst the most highly expressed genes , reflecting the robust translation and protein synthesis processes in the embryonic and larval stages.

gc content and codon usage bias
based on results from a set of  <dig> conserved genes , the average gc content  per coding sequence  is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in l. cuprina and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in d. melanogaster. the effective number of codons  is  <dig>  in l. cuprina and  <dig>  in d. melanogaster. compared to d. melanogaster, l. cuprina shows a different codon preference for  <dig> of the  <dig> amino acids encoded by redundant codons . the most noticeable changes occur in the preferred codons for glutamine , glutamic acid , and leucine .

the preferred codons for each amino acid are in underlined in each species; cases where the preferred codons in l. cuprina are different from those of d. melanogaster are indicated in bold.

protein-coding contents of est assembly
to evaluate the protein coding contents of our ests, the  <dig>  non-redundant sequences were subject to various homology searches against existing sequences . our homology analyses showed that  <dig>   of the non-redundant sequences had significant  matches in the public domains . the sequences that had recognizable homologs constituted  <dig> interproscan and  <dig> gene ontology terms , indicating that a great diversity of protein motifs and biological processes was represented in our dataset. we also estimated that ~78%  of the existing l. cuprina nucleotide sequences in genbank were represented in our est collection. our lucilia ests matched  <dig>  unique d. melanogaster genes  at e-value ≤ 1e-10; this is equivalent to ~ <dig> % of the total gene count in d. melanogaster .

identification of potential detoxification and insecticide target genes
we identified  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> ,  <dig> glutathione s-transferase , and  <dig> esterase  homologs in the l. cuprina . in addition to these detoxification gene families, we also identified ests encoding target proteins that have previously been implicated in insecticide resistance . these included homologs of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein  receptor-associated protein; est = gi: 333428695), glutamate receptor ionotropic kainate  <dig> , and a probable sodium channel protein type  <dig> subunit alpha .

blast negatives in est assembly
as of july  <dig>   <dig>  of the  <dig>  unique gene clusters did not match any sequences in the public databases. three hundred and sixty-five  of these blast negatives had an orf , and the average length of their hypothetical polypeptide products was  <dig> amino acids  .

anchor loci development and chromosomal synteny in higher diptera
one aim of the current est project was to identify single-copy genes that are highly conserved between species for synteny comparison. reciprocal homology searches among l. cuprina, d. melanogaster, and a. gambiae yielded a set of reciprocal best-hit trios, and  <dig> of such trios had favorable intron position and size range in d. melanogaster . this list of  <dig> orthologous groups facilitated our ongoing linkage map construction in l. cuprina. we successfully assigned  <dig> gene markers to  <dig> linkage groups using a male informative pedigree by scoring intron length polymorphisms . comparison between l. cuprina and d. melanogaster based on  <dig> gene markers revealed a high level of synteny, although several deviations were also evident . deviations included inx <dig> rpl <dig>  cg <dig>  rps <dig>  and rpl <dig> , a potential translocation or fusion/dissociation event was identified between the smallest chromosome  and an autosome , as suggested by the location of rps3a .

discussion
the main outcome of this project is the significant improvement of the gene inventory for the australian sheep blowfly lucilia cuprina. amongst other applications, this new resource presents promising benefits to such areas as medical, forensic, pest control, and the understanding of genetic adaptation to insecticides.

barring major gene expansion or contraction, and assuming that l. cuprina has the same number of genes as in d. melanogaster   <cit> , the  <dig>  unique gene clusters we found in our est libraries would account for up to 55% of the genes present in the species. the actual percentage is much lower due to  the tgicl assembly parameters and the presence of  <dig> % short  sequences . an estimate of  <dig> % gene coverage was obtained by limiting homology comparison to l. cuprina and d. melanogaster. however, fast-evolving genes and gene families that have been expanded in the blowfly lineage are under-represented in this analysis. hence, the estimate of  <dig> % could be considered the lower bound of total gene coverage. nonetheless, this is a conservative yet reasonable estimation given that our cdna libraries were not experimentally normalized and that only preadult developmental stages contributed to the transcript pool. the est sequences contain a large number of recognizable protein motifs, as suggested by interproscan results , whose protein products are likely to participate in a myriad of biological and cellular processes, as also suggested by gene ontology analysis .

compared to d. melanogaster, l. cuprina appears to have low gc content and a different codon preference for many amino acids. despite the fact that the comparison was based on  <dig> conserved gene homologs, the codon preferences for d. melanogaster are consistent with those reported by vicario et al.  <cit> . the higher effective nc in l. cuprina  than d. melanogaster  suggests a weaker selection constraint on codon usage in l. cuprina, at least for these highly conserved genes. it is noted that the  <dig> sequence pairs analyzed represent only a small fraction  of the coding sequences in the  <dig> species; perhaps a different pattern might emerge when less-conserved gene homologs are included. nevertheless, these results could be useful for training gene-finding algorithms and the analysis of the full genome sequence when it becomes available.

the acquisition of >  <dig>  blowfly genes allows more sophisticated experimental systems to be developed in the future. aside from the improvement in the knowledge about the genetic composition of the species, the dataset provides a foundation for designing gene-based microarrays for expression profiling. furthermore, the plasmid collections can also serve as a permanent source of cdna clones for protein expression, in situ hybridization, and even for transgenic manipulation such as those described in  <cit> . the sequence knowledge of the housekeeping genes such as the ribosomal protein genes, tubulin, and actin could serve as internal controls for quantitative real-time pcr. in fact, the need for such reference genes was recently discussed in  <cit> . the availability of the l. cuprina cdna sequences would also facilitate quantification of expression profiles of many genes of interest, bypassing the time-consuming gene discovery steps. it is expected that our est collection will be invaluable for annotating the genic regions of the l. cuprina genome, when it is eventually sequenced. conversely, the cdna information could itself serve as a gene database, such that short peptides generated by the high-throughput proteome sequencing, similar to those reported in the brain tissues of another blowfly, protophormia terraenovae  <cit> , could be compared, forming a transcriptomic-proteomic feed-forward loop.

we identified genes that are related to insecticide resistance in l. cuprina . isolation of these homologs in l. cuprina would allow their expression patterns to be accurately measured , and their roles in insecticide resistance to be evaluated. pcr assays to screen for naturally occurring dna polymorphisms  markers) could also be developed to monitor the temporal and spatial distribution of different alleles. while many of their d. melanogaster homologs have been implicated in insecticide detoxification  <cit> , some of the genes identified are involved in other developmental processes such as ecdysone biosynthesis   <cit>  and brain function/development   <cit> . the proportions of the new l. cuprina homologs represent only a small fraction of these  <dig> detoxification gene families . with the advent of next-generation sequencing  technologies, large-scale genome or transcriptome sequencing has become increasingly popular. for example, transcriptomic analyses using ngs have now been reported in many non-model insect species  <cit> . similar approaches could be extended to l. cuprina and other related blowfly species, to enable a more comprehensive assessment of novel insecticide targets.

another important application of our newly identified ests was to improve the genetic map of l. cuprina. ests can be converted to a set of anchor loci for linkage mapping, as has been repeatedly shown in other insects  <cit> . we adopted a conservative "reciprocal best hit with strong homology" strategy in the selection of homologous markers, in which d. melanogaster served as the primary reference. a. gambiae, which diverged from the lucilia and drosophila lineages about  <dig> mya, acted as an outgroup to improve the confidence in orthology calling, as sequence homology needed to reach the e-value of ≤ 1e- <dig> threshold to be considered further. in other words, we opted for confidence rather than sensitivity in our search for orthologous markers.

the est-derived markers constituted a substantial proportion of anchor loci in the present study and were useful for inferring chromosomal synteny . linkage assignment of  <dig> markers allowed us to conclude that chromosomal synteny is high between the lucilia and drosophila lineages. our results are typical for higher dipteran species, as suggested by previous studies  <cit> . several chromosomal fusion/dissociation events have nonetheless been documented within the drosophila genus. for example, the fusion of chr  <dig>  to an autosome was found in drosophila willistoni  <cit> . moreover, comparison between mosquito and drosophila reveals that patches of syntenic regions are scattered across many chromosome regions  <cit> . our mapping results suggested that gene content on each of the muller's elements in l. cuprina can, to a large extent, be predicted from the d. melanogaster map. however, the obvious cases of synteny violation  would mean that direct extrapolation of linkage information from d. melanogaster would require extra caution. the interspecies differences should justify future de novo construction of linkage maps for l. cuprina, with denser markers.

the  <dig> putative orthologs effectively form a pipeline for future comparative mapping efforts . their chromosome addresses in d. melanogaster span virtually all regions of the genome, allowing flexible control over marker density for genomic regions of interest. several chromosomal areas in lucilia are of significant historical importance: the scallop/notch  <cit>  on chromosome ii and the rop- <dig>  <cit>  regions on chromosome iv. in fact, several gene markers generated in the present study have already been utilized to understand the patterns of selective sweeps around the rop- <dig> locus  <cit> . the marker pipeline also offers a starting point for fine scale mapping of the fitness modifier locus , which is believed to counter the fitness disadvantage of the diazinon-resistant flies in the absence of insecticide  <cit> . together with an appropriate genomic library, these newly acquired ests provide an ample supply of markers for positional cloning of the m locus.

the evolutionary origin and phylogeny relationship among blowfly species has been of great interest to many researchers, owing to its medical and forensic implications  <cit> . with the much expanded gene repertoire, some of the l. cuprina genes identified here, especially those that show least similarity to other known sequences could be utilized to develop species diagnostic assays. the current est sequences would greatly complement such an exploration.

while the assemblage of  <dig>  ests into  <dig>  was straight forward, the interpretation of the information contents requires regular re-adjustment, in light of the constantly expanding sequence databases in other species. in order to evaluate the coding components of the newly acquired sequences, they were sorted according to the level of homology to their counterparts in the genbank reference protein database, producing a typical blast significance spectrum . it is anticipated that such a spectrum would change over time. as new sequences from other organisms become publicly accessible, it would simultaneously alter the structure of the existing sequence databases and hence the blast results. the recently released est collections  from  <dig> closely related taxa  clearly illustrate this notion .

given that the number of non-redundant sequence clusters depends largely on the assembly settings, the "90% identity over  <dig> bases" requirement could be viewed as a balanced option, but might not be an optimized condition for all genes. one indication is the presence of residual sequence redundancy in the dataset, presumably due to the natural existence of splice variants, transcript isoforms, natural polymorphisms, or genuine gene families. hence, it is worthwhile to disassemble relevant contigs that belong to the gene of interest and find the most appropriate parameters to reassemble these reads. furthermore, we did not impose any restriction on the length of the sequences, i.e., removal of assembled contigs or reads less than a certain length , because such sequences could be part of the untranslated regions of many legitimate mrna transcripts. as more similar est sequences from closely related taxa become available, these short reads might ultimately be informative in the future. in summary, the tgicl assembly described in this paper only represents a generic, non-discriminatory clustering approach for the entire dataset, and re-assembling for the original ests might be necessary to produce the most accurate assembly for a given gene or a set of related genes.

CONCLUSIONS
we report the generation of  <dig>  ests  from the australian sheep blowfly lucilia cuprina. homology analyses revealed that the dataset captured a wide diversity of genes, including those related to insecticide resistance targets and detoxification gene families. our data also indicate that l. cuprina coding sequences are at rich and that codon usage patterns are distinct from that of d. melanogaster. in addition, a subset of putative orthologous genes was identified and mapped to the lucilia linkage groups, which revealed a high but incomplete chromosomal synteny with d. melanogaster.
