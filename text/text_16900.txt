BACKGROUND
glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor  was originally purified from rat b-49-conditioned medium and was characterized as a potent neurotrophic factor for culturing dopaminergic neurons from the developing substantia nigra  <cit> . gdnf is a distantly related member of the transforming growth factor-β  superfamily  <cit> , and additional gdnf homologs have also been cloned  <cit> . gdnf expression is widespread in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, in addition to outside of the nervous system  <cit> . the targeted disruption of the mouse gdnf gene showed that gdnf plays a critical role in the development of both kidney and enteric neurons during embryogenesis  <cit> . gdnf possesses multifunctional properties that regulate the development and differentiation of a variety of cell lineages and acts as a neurotrophic factor for specific types of neurons in the nervous system. accordingly, many investigators have reported the regulation of gdnf mrna in various types of cells, such as astrocytes, microglial cells and macrophages, both in vitro and in vivo during tissue development and in pathophysiological states, including in response to inflammatory stimuli, ischemic/hypoxic insults and spinal cord injury  <cit> . however, the precise mechanisms regulating gdnf mrna expression are not yet fully understood.

for many genes, the promoter and enhancer activities of their 5'-flanking regions and introns have been extensively characterized in the evaluation of gene expression regulation. however, the regulation of mrna stability has also been demonstrated to play an important role in controlling gene expression  <cit> . in particular, a sequence rich in adenosine  and uridine , containing the au-rich element , auuua, has been identified to regulate expression levels of mrna. the are motif was first identified within the 3'-untranslated regions  of mrnas encoding cytokines  <cit> , and many genes have been predicted to produce are-containing mrnas  <cit> .

in this study, we focused on the regulatory role of ares in the 3'-utr of exon  <dig> in the mouse gdnf gene. in addition, the are-containing region of gdnf exon  <dig> fused to the end of the luciferase or the mouse gdnf coding region markedly diminished each expression.

RESULTS
to evaluate the characteristic features of the 3'-utr of the mouse gdnf gene, which consists of an approximately 2800-bp long nucleotide sequence immediately following the stop codon , we first compared the gdnf 3'-utr among the following  <dig> species: danio rerio, gallus gallus, mus musculus, rattus norvegicus, canis lupus familiaris, equus caballus, bos taurus, sus scrofa, macaca mulatta, pan troglodytes and homo sapiens. except for the nucleotide sequences of the putative d. rerio and g. gallus gdnf 3'-utrs, the sequences in the proximal half  and the end region  of the 3'-utr are homologous to each other. interestingly, an a/t-rich sequence, attta  <cit> , is well conserved among  <dig> species, and is serially located approximately  <dig> bp downstream of the stop codon in the gdnf 3'-utr with the exception of d. rerio. as shown in figure 1b, the homology of the nucleotide sequences of these a/t rich regions between mouse and human is approximately 90%. therefore, we characterized the features of the well-conserved region of the mouse gdnf 3'-utr, particularly the are consensus sequences, in regulating gene expression using a luciferase reporter system.

as shown in figure  <dig>  we inserted the full-length mouse gdnf 3'-utr into downstream of the luciferase gene in the pgl3-promoter vector and estimated the luciferase activity in transiently transfected c <dig> glioma cells. the luciferase activity of the reporter gene containing the full-length mouse gdnf 3'-utr was markedly lower than that of the control pgl3-promoter vector without the 3'-utr . a series of deletion constructs of the 3' end of the mouse gdnf 3'-utr  revealed that the region around the are sequences showed suppressive effects on the expression of the reporter gene. in addition, the unconserved region in the distal half of the mouse gdnf 3'-utr  also suppressed luciferase activity. we also observed a similar inhibitory effect of the 3'-utr  on luciferase activity when the reporter constructs containing approximately  <dig>  kb of the mouse gdnf promoter region were included in the pgl <dig> basic vector . furthermore, the mouse gdnf construct that included the are sequences following the coding region led to marginal expression of the gdnf protein in transfected c <dig> glioma cells .

by studying the suppressive feature in the well-conserved proximal half of the mouse gdnf 3'-utr, we found that the insertion of an approximately  <dig> bp region of the 3'-utr  containing three ares  into the pgl3-promoter vector was sufficient to suppress the luciferase activity in the c <dig> cells . in contrast, the insertion of this suppressive region in the opposite direction  and the 3'-utr  region of the same length  into the pgl3-promoter vector had little effect on the luciferase activity in the c <dig> cells. the expression of luciferase mrna in the c <dig> cells transfected with the Δ <dig> construct was negligible compared to the cells transfected with the Δ <dig> or Δ8r construct , and deletion of the core are region  from the wt, Δ <dig> and Δ <dig> constructs partialy recovered the promoter activity . the luciferase activity of the wt or Δ <dig> construct in transfected cells was extremely low , however the deletion of the core are region from the wt and Δ <dig> constructs caused an approximately 2-fold increase in the promoter activity. the luciferase activity in the Δ <dig> construct-transfected cells was approximately half of that in the pgl3pro-transfected cells and was almost equal to that in the cells transfected with the Δ <dig> construct, which contains the upstream sequence  from the core are region only. furthermore, we evaluated the stability of the luciferase mrna in each case using actinomycin d  . to estimate the remaining luciferase mrna in each of the reporter-transfected cell lines, we first determined the cycle count of the polymerase chain reaction  to detect the luciferase mrna in the Δ <dig> construct-transfected cells. three hours after treatment with act-d, the amount of luciferase mrna in the c <dig> cells transfected with the Δ <dig> construct was approximately 25% lower than that in the cells transfected with the original pgl3-promoter vector; however, this difference was not significant.

lastly, we characterized the ares of the mouse gdnf 3'-utr and the nucleotide sequences adjacent to these elements by generating various deletion reporter constructs. the c <dig> cells transfected with the 3'-utr construct containing the sequences from either side of the ares  showed lower luciferase activities; however, the cells transfected with the 3'-utr construct without these adjacent sequences  showed higher luciferase activity than both the Δ <dig> and Δ <dig> constructs . the c <dig> cells transfected with a construct of the 3'-utr serially deleted from either side of the Δ <dig> region showed higher luciferase activities when the length of the Δ <dig> region was reduced and each are was sequentially deleted . consistent with the results in figure 6b, the Δ <dig> construct, which lacked the core are and following downstream regions , still suppressed the lucifease activity by approximately 50%.

discussion
using a luciferase reporter assay, our results are the first to demonstrate that the mouse gdnf 3'-utr has multiple suppressive regions regulate gene expression. in this study, we employed three types of promoters  and two genes  to characterize the features of the mouse gdnf 3'-utr. among several regions in the mouse gdnf 3'-utr, we focused on the role of the ares in the middle region of the 3'-utr in regulating gene expression in a post-transcriptional manner, such as through mrna stability, because these particular ares are higly conserved among eleven different organisms. in our experiments, the c <dig> cells transfected with an expression construct in which the au-rich region was immediately downstream of the coding region expressed negligible amounts of mrna and protein. these results suggest that the suppressive effects of this au-rich region in the mouse gdnf 3'-utr are not affected by the coding sequences or promoters. barreau et al. have proposed that there are three different classes of ares  <cit> , and according to their classification, the au-rich region in the gdnf 3'-utr belongs to class i because it contains the are consensus sequences, auuua. in our deletion analyses, the reporters in which the ares were serially deleted gradually lost their suppressive properties, demonstrating that three are consensus sequences in the mouse gdnf 3'-utr play a cooperative role in regulating the amounts of mrna. however, our results also indicated that this suppressive function does not simply depend on these conserved ares. the Δ <dig> construct containing only the core are region  did not exhibit a convincing suppressive effect. the Δ <dig> construct containing only the short region , just upstream from the are region, still exhibited reduced luciferase activity of approximately 50% compared to pgl3pro. it seems that both region adjacent to the ares might be required to suppress the luciferase activity effectively. hajarnis et al. have reported that the gc-rich sequences adjacent to an are in the 3'-utr of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase also function to destabilize the mrna  <cit> . we also demonstrated that the core are-deletion  from entire gdnf 3'-utr caused an apparent doubling of luciferase activity. it is possible that other suppressive factors recognize currently uncharacterized regions in the mosue gdnf 3'-utr to exert the full suppressive effect. in contrast to the high conservation of the region around the ares among  <dig> species, the distal half of the mouse gdnf 3'-utr  is approximately 85% homologous to only the putative rat gdnf 3'-utr. meanwhile, the posterior half of the human gdnf 3'-utr is highly similar to only the putative rhesus and chimpanzee sequences. the homology is lower between rodents and primates. as shown in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  this unconserved region showed a marked suppressive effect on the promoter activity, and the deletion of the core are from the wt and Δ <dig> constructs recovered the activity to a lesser extent. therefore, we conclude that in addition to our characteirzed ares, common and species-specific negative factors cooperatively recognize the concensus sequences in the gdnf 3'-utr to regulate the expression of the gdnf gene. however, the precise mechanism for the down-regulation of expression by the 3'-utr remain to be determined.

it has been reported that an are in the 3'-utr regulates the expression of many types of genes, including some cytokines, immediate early genes and trophic factors  <cit> . moreover, many families of rna-binding proteins that specifically recognize an are in several genes have been identified. auf <dig> consists of four splicing variants and is reported to destabilize mrna through an are  <cit> . in contrast, the elav family members, including hur, hud, hub and huc, are suggested to enhance mrna stabilization  <cit> . we transfected our reporter constructs containing the mouse gdnf 3'-utr together with the auf <dig> splicing variants or the elav family members; however, none of the are-binding proteins restored luciferase activity in the c <dig> cells transfected . some stimuli  have been reported to stabilize mrna through the activation of intracellular signaling pathways  <cit>  and/or the modification of rna-binding proteins  <cit> . we attempted to examine the effects of pma and lps, which were previously reported to up-regulate endogenous gdnf mrna, but neither stimulus inhibited the suppressive effect of an are in the mouse gdnf 3'-utr. as some factors, including poly-binding proteins  <cit>  and micrornas  <cit> , have also been reported to post-transcripionally regulate the amount of mrna with a 3'-utr in quantity, we investigated whether pabpc <dig>  a poly-binding protein, affects the suppressive effect of the mouse gdnf 3'-utr. our results show that pabpc <dig> overexpression does not affect this suppressive feature. therefore, it is still unclear which factors  participate in gdnf expression via its 3'-utr. using mirbase http://www.mirbase.org/ to search for micrornas that might recognize the are and non-are regions, we found that some micrornas  are predictied to associate with the suppressive regions within the Δ <dig> and Δ  <dig> regions, respectively. thus, further studies on the identification and characterization of negative regulators that destabilize the gdnf mrna in combination with ares and other suppressive regions of the gdnf 3'-utr are required to determine the mehanisms for regulating gdnf expression under pathophysilological conditions.

we previously characterized three distinct mouse gdnf promoters upstream of exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . brodbeck et al. reported that six <dig>  a homeobox gene, recognizes its consensus sequence in the mouse gdnf promoter  <dig> and potentiates its promoter activity  <cit> . with the exception of six <dig> as a regulator of renal development  <cit> , none of the transcriptional factors related to neuronal inflammation have been identified, although many inflammatory stimuli are reported to enhance intrinsic gdnf mrna expression in vivo and in vitro  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our present study is the first to suggest the possible role of several regions in the 3'-utr of the mouse gdnf gene in regulating its gene expression. among these regions, we characterized the suppressive feature of a well-conserved a- and t-rich region  in the mouse gdnf 3'-utr. based on the well-conserved nucleotide sequences surrounding the ares among  <dig> species, the are of the human gdnf 3'-utr is predicted to have a similarly suppressive role. further characterization of the interaction of this are with other suppressive regions in the gdnf 3'-utr, together with that of the gdnf promoter, will help to clarify the complex regulatory mechanisms of gdnf gene expression.
