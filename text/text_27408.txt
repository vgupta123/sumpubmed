BACKGROUND
jatropha curcas l., one of the  <dig> species in genus jatropha of the family euphorbiaceae is a perennial small tree or large shrub native to tropical america and is distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics of asia and africa  <cit> . recently, jatropha oil is promoted as alternative transport fuel which can be directly blended with petro-diesel or transesterified with methanol and used as biodiesel. from a global food security point of view, jatropha being a non-edible crop which can be grown in areas not suitable for agriculture, is a preferred source for biodiesel feedstock as it does not compete with production of food crops. it reduces the dependence on fossil fuel which is often imported by using precious foreign currency. its decentralized production will provide income for a large number of small and marginal farmers. biodiesel is also less harmful to the environment in that its production and combustion reduces emission of greenhouse gases by 41% relative to fossil fuel  <cit> . it is reported that biodiesel emits less particulate matter than diesel upon combustion  <cit> . in fact, large scale jatropha cultivation will improve the environment by greening the area and transforming the wasteland to productive land by preventing soil erosion, causing accumulation of organic matter, increasing soil microbial activity, etc.

the demand for biodiesel production is very huge that it cannot be met from wild grown plants. increasing the jatropha production requires both to bring more area under cultivation and to enhance productivity. though jatropha can grow and survive in wasteland with less water, nutrient, and virtually no pest and disease management, productive growth and better yield under restrictive environmental conditions require the development of resilient genotypes. genotypes with improved drought tolerance are preferred for plantations in marginal lands. large scale plantations may bring in new challenges which need to be addressed. it was reported that j. curcas planted in continuous stretches as a monocrop were devastated by flower and seed feeding insects scutellera nobilis and pempelia morosalis  <cit> . this indicates that plant breeding programs to develop pest and disease resistance are required when large scale cultivation of jatropha is planned.

in addition, jatropha oil composition itself may have to be modified to make it the best feedstock for biodiesel production. oils with more of saturated fatty acids give higher cetane number, and oxidative stability which are desirable for combustion/ignition quality and shelf life of biodiesel, respectively. but jatropha oil contains less of saturated fatty acids  and more of unsaturated fatty acids   <cit> . while viscosity of petro-diesel is  <dig>  mm2/s, it is  <dig>  mm2/s for biodiesel derived from jatropha oil. viscosity affects atomization of the fuel upon injection into the combustion chamber, and thereby, increases the formation of engine deposits  <cit> . more the carbon number of saturated fatty acids higher will be the viscosity. jatropha contains  <dig> % 18-carbon fatty acids and only  <dig> % 16-carbon fatty acids  <cit> . it is possible to make significant changes in the jatropha oil composition by genetic engineering of the metabolic pathway of oil biosynthesis. therefore, there is a need and scope for genetic improvement of jatropha by using plant breeding and genetic engineering methods.

genetic intervention in jatropha requires understanding of the biosynthetic pathways, metabolic flux control points, cloning of the genes that code for the enzymes and proteins involved in the metabolic pathways and development of molecular markers. molecular studies in jatropha are limited and only a few genes have been isolated from jatropha  <cit> . currently, the dbest of ncbi contains only  <dig> annotated expressed sequence tags  from jatropha. we have initiated a gene discovery project by large scale sequencing of ests. ests are short, single pass sequence reads from 5'or 3' end of randomly selected cdna clones. sequencing of ests has been successfully employed in several plants including tomato  <cit> , citrus  <cit> , castor  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , water melon  <cit> , radish  <cit>  with the objective of gene discovery, metabolic pathway interpretation, gene cloning, molecular marker development, construction of genetic and physical map and comparative mapping and analysis. when sequencing of ests is employed for gene discovery purpose, normalization of the cdna library will greatly increase the efficiency and economy of the process. normalization reduces the frequency of abundant genes  and enriches the library with rare genes   <cit> . since sequencing of ests is carried out with the ultimate objective of cloning the genes, it would be highly desirable to combine the normalization with enrichment for full-length clones. this paper reports construction of a normalized and full-length enriched cdna library from developing seeds of j. curcas and isolation of  <dig> unigenes by sequencing of  <dig>  ests.

RESULTS
construction of cdna library
construction of cdna library and sequencing of ests helps in rapid gene discovery especially in non-model organisms where no prior sequencing data is available. next generation sequencing technologies can circumvent the need for constructing cdna libraries and generate extraordinarily huge amount of sequencing data to further speed up the gene discovery process. however, sequencing of cdna clones has several advantages over the next generation sequencing methods such as higher average read length, virtually no assembly problem, ability to isolate full length genes without going for race pcr and availability of physical clones for further characterization and applications.

for the present study, a normalized and full-length enriched cdna library was constructed from developing seeds of j. curcas. the normalization efficiency was monitored by using chloramphenicol reporter gene. before normalization, the reporter gene was added to the cdna population to a redundant rate of about 1% which was found to be reduced to less than  <dig> % after normalization. this indicated  <dig> fold reduction in abundance due to normalization. this normalization will greatly help to enrich the library for rare genes. in addition, it will increase the rate recovery of unigenes and reduce the cost of sequencing by avoiding redundant clones. in fact, the rate of recovery of unigenes in this study was about 58%  which is much higher than  <dig> to 40% reported from non-normalized cdna libraries  <cit> .

the cdna library can be more efficiently used for gene discovery if normalization is combined with enrichment for full-length genes. this was done by removing cdnas smaller than  <dig>  kb. removal of smaller fragments will also increase the cloning efficiency of longer cdnas. the cdna library constructed for this study was estimated to contain about  <dig> ×  <dig> clones. ninety six clones were randomly selected to test for the enrichment of full-length genes in these clones. the insert size ranged between  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb with an estimated average insert size of  <dig>  kb . blastx analysis of the sequences revealed that 94% of the clones could potentially encode for full-length genes. these results indicated that this cdna library could be reliably used for the gene discovery project in jatropha.

sequencing of expressed sequence tags 
from the normalized and full-length enriched cdna library,  <dig>  clones were patched for plasmid dna isolation. clones which did not grow in the selection medium or did not yield sufficient quantity or quality of plasmid dna were discarded. plasmid dna suitable for sequencing was isolated from  <dig>  clones. these clones were sequenced using m <dig> reverse primer  which directly reads the cdnas from the 5' end. nucleotide bases having phred value less than  <dig> were discarded. vector backbone and additional sequences that were added during cdna synthesis were removed. after the trimming exercise  <dig> empty clones  and  <dig>  high quality ests were obtained. the read length of the high quality ests ranged between  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp with an average length of  <dig> bp which is comparable with other reports  <cit> .

contig assembly of ests
contig assembly of the  <dig>   <dig> ests was done to remove the redundant ests so that the unique ests  can be annotated. the summary of the contig assembly is given in table  <dig>  it showed  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons. the contig size ranged between  <dig> and  <dig>  and there were  <dig> ests in the  <dig> contigs indicating the presence of  <dig> redundant ests. the  <dig> contigs were manually checked and the longest est from each contig was selected as unigene. these representative ests from contigs and the  <dig> singletons together resulted in  <dig> unigenes from the  <dig>  ests assembled.

sequencing of ests from developing seeds often showed the abundance of genes coding for seed storage proteins  <cit> . on the contrary, the current study the showed the abundance of genes related to stress response, disease resistance and plant development . the largest contig contained  <dig> ests coding for phosphoethanolamine n-methyltransferase which is essential for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. it is reported that  <dig> % phospholipid in jatropha seed is composed of phosphatidylcholine  <cit> . phosphatidylcholine is hydrolyzed into phosphatidic acid and choline. phosphatidic acid acts as second messenger in stress signaling, and choline is a precursor for glycine betaine synthesis. glycine betaine is a compatible solute and its accumulation is widely reported to confer salt and oxidative stress  <cit> . other contigs contained ests coding for indole- <dig> acetic acid amido synthetase, ccr <dig> associated factor, ethylene responsive transcription factor and calcineurin b which are also involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants  <cit> . the contigs also represented ests coding for protein disulfide isomerase, copine and sucrose synthase which are involved in seed development  <cit>  and seed size  <cit> .

* calculated as percentage of  <dig> unigenes

annotation of unigenes
in total,  <dig> unigenes  showing significant similarity with genes available in the non-redundant database were identified. most of these unigenes showed highest similarity with genes from castor . this is expected because jatropha itself is called 'wild' castor and both species belong to the family euphorbiaceae. next to castor, most of the unigenes showed similarity with genes from grape  that belongs to the family vitaceae. phylogenetic analysis using  <dig> selected ests by including orthologs from five oilseed crops and v. vinifera also revealed that j. curcas is closely related to r. communis followed by v. vinifera . this association is totally unexpected according to the morphological system of classification  <cit>  in which jatropha belongs to monochlamideae whereas vitis belongs to polypetalae. however, more recent angiosperm phylogeny group classifications, apgii and apgiii  <cit> , which are based on cladistic analysis of larger data sets involving dna sequences or other forms of systematic data show many contradictory relationships  <cit> . according to these classifications, the malpighiales  and vitales  are placed much closer under a major core eudicots clade, rosids. our data based on coding genes corroborate the apg classification with regard to jatropha and vitis.

genes for oil biosynthesis and β-oxidation
recently jatropha seed oil is widely used for biodiesel production as an alternative renewable energy source. it is important to undertake genetic improvement of this crop to increase oil content, to modify the oil composition, to remove toxic compounds, to increase drought tolerance etc. seed oil content in brassica and arabidopsis has been increased by the overexpression of diacyl glycerol acyl transferase, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase  <cit> . seed oil composition has been changed in soybean by using mutant 3-keto-acyl-acp synthase ii gene which increases the 16-carbon fatty acids and decreases 18-carbon fatty acids  <cit> . silencing of stearoyl-acp desaturase has dramatically increased the content of saturated fatty acid  from  <dig> % to 32% in brassica  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that increased oil content and specialized seed oil composition can be achieved in jatropha also, provided the genes involved in rate limiting steps of oil biosynthesis pathway are cloned. important oil biosynthesis genes identified in the present study include the genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis in plastids , desaturation of fatty acids , hydrolysis of fatty acids from acyl-acp , activation and transport of free fatty acids to endoplasmic reticulum  and serial incorporation of activated fatty acids to the glycerol backbone to form triacylglycerol or oil . some of these genes are being cloned in plant expression vector for functional evaluation in arabidopsis and tobacco. the unigene collection also contained genes for acyl-coa oxidase, enoyl-coa hydratase, β-hydroxyl acyl-coa dehydrogenase and acyl-coa acetyl transferase which are involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids and their derivatives. many of the mutant studies revealed the importance of these enzymes in the breakdown of reserve triacylglycerol, seed development, seed germination, vegetative and reproductive growth phases  <cit> . hence the cloning of the genes for beta oxidation pathway will be a valuable source for the genetic manipulation of oil degradation and plant growth.

genes for crop improvement
jatropha is a non-edible plant proposed to be grown in areas not suitable for agriculture such as wasteland, sides of railway track, lands with severe water scarcity, saline areas etc. hence jatropha should be able to withstand these stresses. plants respond to these stresses by modulating gene expression, which restores the cellular homeostasis, detoxification and recovery of growth  <cit> . for example, overexpression of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase gene conferred salt stress tolerance in carrot, maize and tomato  <cit>  and zhang et al.  <cit>  showed that glycine betaine level is increased under drought, heat and salt stresses in jatropha also. when enzymes for glycine betaine biosynthesis are expressed in plants that do not naturally produce glycine betaine, they accumulate little glycine betaine, because their endogenous choline supply is inadequate  <cit> . these plants may require overexpression of phosphoethanolamine n-methyltransferase to overproduce choline. overexpression of na+/h+ antiporter from pennisetum glaucum conferred high level of salinity tolerance in transgenic brassica  <cit>  and overexpression of e. coli trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene conferred drought and salt tolerance in rice  <cit> . the stress related unigenes identified in the current study include the genes coding for phosphoethanolamine n-methyltransferase, na+/h+ antiporter, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione s-transferase, spermidine synthase, ethylene-responsive transcription factors, ascorbate peroxidase, late embryogenesis abundant proteins, aquaporin, and salt tolerance protein.

the genes that code for the enzymes involved in different metabolic pathways are very important for genetic manipulation in jatropha. several genes involved in diverse metabolic pathways such as phospholipids biosynthesis, flavanol synthesis, glycolysis, tca cycle, hmp shunt, glycogenesis were identified from the current study. other important genes identified from this study are ferritin, mevalonate kinase, lipoxygenase, glutamate decarboxylase, ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase, cinnamoyl-coa reductase, zeta-carotene desaturase, gibberellin 2-oxidase, lipoic acid synthetase and beta-carotene hydroxylase. the unigenes also included  <dig> gene families with  <dig> or more genes. there were  <dig> families with more than  <dig> genes and a highest number of  <dig> members were identified in serine-threonine kinase gene family. other gene families included glucan endo- <dig> -beta-glucosidase precursor, aspartic proteinase nepenthesin- <dig> precursor, calmodulin binding protein, f-box family protein, wd-repeat protein, pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein, cytochrome p <dig> etc.

genes with unknown functions
blastx results showed that  <dig> % of j. curcas unigenes  are having significant similarity with genes that code for unknown, hypothetical and putative proteins. this is significantly higher than  <dig> to 25% unknown genes reported in arabidopsis, citrus and oil palm  <cit> . it was found that  <dig> % of j. curcas unigenes  did not have significant similarity with any genes available in the non-redundant database at ncbi. this is significantly lower than  <dig> - 24% of such genes reported in other plants  <cit> . these genes are very important as they may be specific to jatropha.

full-length unigenes
almost all of the unigenes will be full-length at the 3' end because first strand cdna synthesis was carried out using oliog-dt primer which initiates synthesis from poly  tail of the mrnas. therefore, full-length nature of the cdnas at the 5' end was analyzed using the blastx results. this could be done for  <dig> of the  <dig> unigenes which showed significant similarity with genes in the non-redundant database at ncbi. it was found that  <dig> % of the unigenes  potentially code for full-length genes. this is significantly higher than 60-75% full-length genes reported before  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> unigenes that could not be analyzed by blastx for lack of similarity with genes in the database at ncbi were analyzed by predicting open reading frames . in  <dig> unigenes, 5'utr and single longest orf covering almost the entire lengths of the sequences were identified . these unigenes could also be considered as potential full-length unigenes. in  <dig> unigenes, 5'utrs were present but the orfs terminated prematurely. we could not predict orfs in the remaining  <dig> unigenes. these results show that the library is highly enriched with full length genes that it can be highly useful for gene discovery purpose.

functional classification
functional coverage of the unigenes was identified by comparing the functional distribution of the genes from fully sequenced a. thaliana genome. unigenes were searched against a. thaliana genome for functional annotation and locus identifiers using blastn at tair. the gene ontology annotations were assigned for each unigene based on the locus identifiers using go annotation and categorization tool at tair. the  <dig> unigenes from j. curcas were classified under three broad functional categories using go slim terms. distribution of j. curcas unigenes and a. thaliana genome under these three broad functional categories is shown in figure  <dig>  this classification provides information on percentage of j. curcas unigenes involved in the signal transduction, anabolism, catabolism, reproduction and so on. the results showed that the unigenes cover all the go slim terms in arabidopsis.

the unigenes were first classified according their function in  <dig> different cellular compartments and anatomical structures such as endoplasmic reticulum, plastid, mitochondria, nucleus, cell wall, golgi apparatus etc. which may have unique genes or specific expression profiles. the proportion of genes identified under each class was comparable with a. thaliana genome except those unigenes which were classified under 'unknown cellular components' . majority of the unigenes were grouped under 'other intra-cellular components', 'unknown cellular components', 'other cytoplasmic components' and 'chloroplast', which accounted for about 55% of the unigenes. though, non-green tissue was used for the cdna library construction, about 12% of the unigenes belonged to chloroplast cellular component.

the unigenes were then classified according to their involvement in  <dig> different biological processes such as protein metabolism, developmental processes, response to stress, transcription, signal transduction etc. these processes are very important for a cell to live and reproduce. hence, the genes that cover the biological processes are of great importance for functional study. it was found that the larger part of the j. curcas unigenes were grouped under 'other cellular process', 'other metabolic process' and 'unknown biological processes' accounting for  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively .

the unigenes were finally classified under  <dig> different molecular functions which mainly correspond to the activities performed by the gene products from individual gene or group of genes such as transferase activity, hydrolase activity, kinase activity, receptor binding, receptor activity etc. greater part of the unigenes was classified under 'unknown molecular function', 'other enzyme activity', 'other binding', 'transferase activity' which accounted for  <dig> % of the unigenes .

validation of ests
in order to validate the expression of ests, a set of  <dig> ests for representing oil biosynthesis genes were selected and their expression was studied in roots, mature leaves, flowers and developing seeds of j. curcas. these ests were first sequenced from the 3' ends and primers specific to 3'utr were designed to increase their specificity to the respective transcripts. gene expression was studied by using semi-quantitative rt-pcr and actin was used as an internal control . the results confirmed that the transcripts representing all the selected ests are actively expressed in j. curcas. all the transcripts were found to be expressed in all the tissues without significant variation in the level of expression, except acp gene which showed significantly higher expression in flower. o'hara et al.  <cit>  have also reported that in flowers, the acp gene is expressed at higher level than the other genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
normalized and full-length enriched cdna library was constructed and  <dig>  clones were sequenced from j. curcas for the first time. from these sequences,  <dig> unigenes were identified which included  <dig> potential full-length genes. these genes encoded for diverse biological functions in j. curcas including oil biosynthesis, stress response, flavanol biosynthesis etc. these genes will serve as invaluable resource for the genetic engineering to modify oil composition and to increase oil content, seed yield, pest and disease resistance to make jatropha more suitable for biodiesel production and profitable to farmers. gene discovery from other tissues of j. curcas are being attempted by using next generation sequencing technology.
