BACKGROUND
genome-wide expression data have been widely collected by the recent microarray  or rna-seq technologies  <cit> . in addition to the differential expression analysis for the identification of potential study-related biomarkers  <cit> , gene set enrichment analysis  for the identification of study-related pathways  has received a considerable attention in the recent literature  <cit> . it enables us to detect weak but coherent changes in individual genes through aggregating information from a specific group of genes.

in the current public databases, large genome-wide expression data sets or multiple genome-wide expression data sets have been made available  <cit> . for a large data set, multiple subsets can be generated according to different stages of an important feature. integrative analysis enables us to detect weak but coherent changes in individual datasets through aggregating information from different datasets .

integrative gene set enrichment is an approach that aggregates information from a specific group of genes among different datasets . due to the aforementioned complex analysis scenario, different analysis methods are needed to address different study purposes. for example, the study purpose can be to identify gene sets with statistical significance after data integration  and an extension of traditional meta-analysis method can be used, or the study purpose can be to identify gene sets with concordance enrichment and a mixture model based approach can be used.

in this study, we consider a series of related genome-wide expression data sets collected at different stages of an important feature. for an illustrative example, rna-seq data can be collected at many different growth time points and we are interested in the following study purpose. the gene expression in some pathways may be overall high at early time points and overall low at later time points. it is biologically interesting to identify these pathways with clearly discordant behaviors. pang and zhao  <cit>  have recently suggested a stratified gene set enrichment analysis.  the analysis purpose in this study is different from theirs. as we have explained, to achieve an efficient analysis for the detection of discordance among a series of related genome-wide expression data sets, we need a specific statistical method.

in a differential expression analysis and/or gene set enrichment analysis, it is usually unknown whether a gene is truly differentially expressed  or non-differentially expressed . statistically, we can conduct a test  for the observations from each gene and obtain a p-value to evaluate how likely the gene is differentially expressed. false discovery rate  <cit>  can be used to evaluate the proportion of false positives among claimed positives. another approach can also be considered. it is based on the well-known finite normal-distribution mixture model  <cit> . signed z-scores can be obtained from one-sided p-values  <cit> . the assumption is that all the z-scores are a sample of a mixture model with three components: one with zero population mean representing non-differentially expressed genes and the other two with positive and negative population means representing up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively. the false discovery rate  can be conveniently calculated under this framework.

in the mixture model approach, although the component information is still unknown, it can be estimated by the well-established e-m algorithm  <cit> . this information has been used to address the enrichment in concordance among different data sets  <cit> . in this study, our interest is to detect enrichment in discordance among a series of related genome-wide expression data sets collected at different stages of an important feature. the estimated component information can be useful in the calculation of discordance enrichment probability . therefore, our method is developed based on a mixture model.

in the “methods” section, we will review the background for our mixture model based approach. without a structure consideration, the model parameter space increases exponentially with the increase of number of data sets. therefore, a novel statistical contribution of this study is that we propose a two-level mixture model to achieve a linearly increased parameter space with the increase of number data sets. the model parameters can be estimated by the well-established e-m algorithm and the model-based probability of discordance enrichment can be calculated for gene set detection.

 <dig>  and z-scores  <dig> , - <dig>  and - <dig>  are observed for g
 <dig>  these observations of clear discordance suggest that, in this pathway, some genes may behave clearly differently among different data sets. furthermore, there are five out of nine genes with these clear discordant behaviors. if we only expect about 30% of genes with such behaviors, then this proportion is obviously large . an exploration of pathways  enriched in clear discordance will enable us to further understand the molecular mechanisms of complex diseases.

pancreatic cancer related studies are important in public health  <cit> . recently, gene pnlip  has been shown its association with the pancreatic cancer survival rate  <cit> . a paired two-sample microarray genome-wide expression data set has been collected for studying pancreatic cancer  <cit> . one advantage of this paired design is that we can focus on the expression ratio between tumor and non-tumor tissues for each gene. one related biological motivation is to use the genome-wide expression data set to understand molecular changes related to the change of expression ratio of gene pnlip. in this study, more specifically, our interest is to identify pathways or gene sets showing clearly discordant behavior when the expression ratio of gene pnlip changes. understanding these molecular changes can help us further investigate the role of gene pnlip and even the general disease mechanism of pancreatic cancer.

gene expression profiles are measured as continuous variables. however, if we can perform this analysis with a relatively simple method, then the results can be more interpretable. therefore, our approach is to divide the microarray data set into a series of non-overlapping subsets according to the tumor/non-tumor paired expression ratio of gene pnlip. the log-ratio ranges from a negative value  to a positive value . our purpose is to understand whether any gene sets are enriched in discordant behaviors among these subsets . notice that we only use the expression ratio of gene pnlip to divide the study data set. we do not consider the expression profiles of other genes for data division. there is no analysis optimization in data division and this strategy avoids the selection bias towards our analysis.

the number of study subjects in the microarray data set is adequate so that we can divide the data set into many subsets  so that the biological changes can be better explored. after dividing the study data set into k non-overlapping subsets, we can perform genome-wide differential expression analysis for each subset. genes can be generally categorized as up-regulated , down-regulated  or null . genes may show concordant behaviors or discordant behaviors among different subsets. for examples, showing positive differential expression in all k subsets is clearly a concordant behavior and showing negative differential expression in the first subset but positive differential expression in the last subset is clearly a discordant behavior.

in a genome-wide differential expression analysis, we usually calculate the test scores based on a chosen statistic  to evaluate whether genes are differentially expressed or not. for simplicity, we choose the well-known two-sample t-test. a strong positive or negative differential expression would result in clearly positive or negative test score. a non-differential expression would result in a test score close to zero and the test score could be either positive or negative . therefore, if a gene is concordantly differentially expressed  in some subsets but it is not differentially expressed  in the other subsets, then it can be statistically difficult to evaluate whether the gene has an overall discordant behavior.

therefore, in this study, we focus on genes with some clearly discordant behaviors: up-regulated in at least one subset and down-regulated in at least one subset . we are interested in identifying pathways or gene sets enriched in clearly discordant behaviors. we focus on kegg pathways. the detected pathways will be useful for our further understanding of the role of gene pnlip in pancreatic cancer research.

gene tp <dig> is well-known for its role as tumor suppressor in general cancer studies. its log-ratio in the microarray data set also ranges from a negative value  to a positive value . we also divide the microarray data set according to the expression ratio of gene tp <dig> and repeat the discordance enrichment analysis. we consider the analysis result based on gene tp <dig> a useful comparison with the analysis result based on gene pnlip.

methods
multiple data sets
in this study, we consider a detection of gene set enrichment in discordant behaviors  for a series of two-sample genome-wide expression data sets. the term “enrichment in discordant behaviors" will be mathematically defined later. let k be the number of data sets and let m be the number of common genes among this series of data sets. each data set is collected for two given groups . in general, one group represents a normal status and the other group represents an abnormal status.

for a single two-sample genome-wide expression data set, differential expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis are usually conducted. the purpose of analysis of differential expression is to identify genes showing significantly up-regulation or down-regulation when two sample groups are compared. the purpose of gene set enrichment analysis is to identify pathways  showing coordinate up-regulation or down-regulation, which may be considered as an extension of differential expression analysis.

therefore, the following gene behaviors are usually of our research interest in two-sample expression data analysis: positive change , negative change  and null . however, these underlying behaviors are usually not observed and expression data are collected to make statistical inference about them.

data pre-processing is important for both microarray and rna-seq data and it has been well discussed in the literature . in our study, the data can be downloaded from a well-known public database. we assume that the gene expression profiles have been appropriately pre-processed. in an analysis of multiple expression data sets, it is usually necessary to focus on common genes and gene identifiers can be useful for this purpose. in our study, we divide a relatively large data set into a series of non-overlapping subsets. therefore, all the genes in the downloaded data are common.

z-score
many statistical tests have been proposed for analyzing a two-sample genome-wide expression data set  <cit> . in this study, the traditional paired-two-sample t-test is chosen for its simplicity . for each gene in each data set , we perform the t-test to obtain a t-score. its p-value is evaluated based on the permutation procedure  so that the normal distribution assumption is not assumed for the paired-difference data. all the permuted t-scores are pooled together so that tiny p-values can be calculated  <cit> .

one-sided upper-tailed p-values are calculated so that the direction of change can be distinguished for each gene in each data set. let p
i,k be the p-value for the i-th gene in the k-th data set. z-scores are obtained by an inverse normal transformation 
 zi,k=Φ− <dig>   where Φ is the cumulative distribution function  of the standard normal distribution . this transformation has been widely used  <cit>  and our proposed multivariate normal mixture model will be applied to the transformed z-scores.

discordance enrichment
our proposed method is a type of gene set enrichment analysis. as it has been discussed by lai et al.  <cit> , we defined “enrichment” as “the number of events of interest is larger than expected” and our “event of interest” in this study is “a list of clearly discordant behaviors” from a gene. if we know whether the expression profile of a gene is up-regulated , down-regulated  or non-differentially expressed  in a data set, then a list of concordant behaviors among k data sets for this gene could be ,  or . in this study, we focused on a list with at least one “up” and at least one “down” among k data sets. for example, a list like  is an event of interest but a list like  is not. the reason is “down” and “up” can be visually distinguished by the negative  and positive  signs in z-scores, respectively. however, zero z-scores are rarely observed. therefore, it is less clear to distinguish “null” from “up” .

based on the expression profiles, we obtain z-scores to make statistical inference about genes’ behaviors in each data set. to evaluate “discordance enrichment" as defined above, we considered a mixture model approach that allows us to estimate the probability of a behavior  and the expected number of events of interest . let s be the set of genes for a pathway  and m
s the number of genes in s. if the i-th gene in s is showing a list of clearly discordant behaviors, then we set an indicator variable u
s,i=1; otherwise, we set u
s,i= <dig>  then, we can calculate the discordance enrichment score  for gene set s that is a probability defined as 
 dess=pr∑i=1msus,i>msθ,  in which θ is the proportion of genes with clearly discordant behaviors.

in our mixture model, we used normal distributions to model the z-scores. a novel contribution is that the parameter space of our model increases linearly when the number of data sets is increased. this is due to the two-level structure of our model. . for each gene in each data set, we considered three normal distribution components that represent up-regulation , down-regulation  and null . . the mathematical details are described below.

a two-level mixture model
first, we described the basic model structure for just one data set. then, we introduced our novel two-level mixture model. a simple three-component normal distribution mixture model  <cit>  is considered for each z-score z
i,k : 
 f=∑jk=02ρjk,kϕμjk,k,σjk,k <dig>  


in the above model, ϕμ,σ <dig> is the probability density function  of a normal distribution with mean μ and variance σ
 <dig>  three components represent up-regulation with μ
 <dig> k> <dig>  down-regulation with μ
 <dig> k< <dig> and null with μ
 <dig> k= <dig> . for this model, an assumption is that the p.d.f. of z
i,k is simply ϕμjk,k,σjk,k <dig> if we know the underlying component information j
k for the i-th gene in the k-th data set. however, the component information is usually not observed in practice. then, we have this one-dimensional mixture model after the introduction of component proportion parameters ρjk,k,jk= <dig> , <dig> for the k-th data set.

when we extend the above mixture model to a higher dimension , without a structure consideration, the parameter space increases exponentially due to the 3k different component combinations . therefore, when k is not a small number , we need a more efficient model  <cit> . biologically, when different data sets are collected for the same or similar research purpose, some genes are likely to show consistent behaviors across different data sets and some genes are likely to show different behaviors. for genes likely showing consistent behaviors across k data sets, we consider a complete concordance  multivariate model to approximate the distribution of {z
i,k,k= <dig> ,…,k}. for genes likely showing different behaviors across k data sets, we consider a complete independence  multivariate model to approximate the distribution of {z
i,k,k= <dig> ,…,k}.  we first describe the ci model and cc model as below.

the ci model assumes that the behaviors of the i-th gene are independent across different data sets. therefore, we have the following mixture model: 
 fci=∏k=1k∑jk=02ρjk,kϕμjk,k,σjk,k <dig>  


this model is simply a product of k one-dimensional three-component mixture-models.

the cc model assumes that the behaviors of the i-th gene are the same across different data sets. although the component information is unknown, the components for different data sets must be consistent. therefore, we have the following mixture model: 
 fcc=∑j=02πj∏k=1kϕμj,k,σj,k <dig>  


this model has three components and each component is a product of k normal probability density functions.

in practice, it is unknown whether the i-th gene is showing independent or consistent behaviors. therefore, we consider ci and cc as two high-level components and propose the following two-level model for {z
i,k,k= <dig> ,…,k}: 
 f=λfcc+fci. 


notice that this two-level model is still a mixture model. we further assume that {μjk,k,σjk,k <dig> jk= <dig> , <dig> k= <dig> ,…,k} are shared by both ci and cc models. it is evident that the model parameter space increases linearly when the number of data sets  increases.

we can use the well-established expectation-maximization  algorithm  <cit>  for parameter estimation. first, it is necessary to introduce some indicator variables  for the z-scores {z
i,k,k= <dig> ,…,k} of the i-th gene. then, we describe the e-step and m-step.

for high-level component information, 
 ωi=1if gene’s behaviors are consistent with cc model;0if gene’s behaviors are consistent with ci model. 


for ci model component information, 
 ηi,jk,k=1ifzi,kis sampled from thejk-th component;0otherwise. 


for cc model component information, 
 ξi,j=1if all{zi,k,k= <dig> ,…,k}are sampled from thej-th component;0otherwise. 


the e-step is the calculation of the following expected values when all the parameter values are given. 
 e=λfccλfcc+fci, 
 eηi,jk,k)=ρjk,kϕμjk,k,σjk,k2∏h= <dig> h≠kk∑jh=02ρjh,hϕμjh,h,σjh,h2λfcc+fci. 
 e=λπj∏k=1kϕμj,k,σj,k2λfcc+fci, 


the m-step is the calculation of the following parameter values when all the component information is given: 
 λ^=1m∑i=1me, 



 ρ^jk,k=∑i=1meηi,jk,k∑i=1m∑jh=02eηi,jh,k, 



 π^j=∑i=1me∑i=1m∑h=02e, 



 μ^jk,k=∑i=1me+eηi,jk,k)zi,k∑i=1m, 



 σ^jk,k2=∑i=1m]2∑i=1m. 


e-step and m-step are iterated until a numerical convergence is achieved. in this study, the numerical convergence is defined as that the difference between the current log-likelihood and the previous one is within a given tolerance value .

enrichment score
as we have discussed in discordance enrichment, in this study, we focus on genes’ behaviors with at least one up-regulation and at least one down-regulation among k data sets . however, we do not need to enumerate all these combinations . the related computing can be simplified if we enumerate the compliment events instead. there are three combinations for complete concordance: ,  and . they will be excluded. there are ∑l=1k−1kl combinations with both “null" and “up"  and there are ∑l=1k−1kl combinations with both “null" and “down" . they will also be excluded. then, the remaining combinations are our events of interest .

according to the above computing strategy, based on the two-level mixture model, the related proportion  of genes with clearly discordant behaviors  can be calculated as follows. 
 θ=1−∑j=02∏k=1kρj,k−∑{jk}∈a∏k=1kρjk,k−∑{jk}∈b∏k=1kρjk,k,  where a is the set of lists with a mix of 0’s and 2’s, and b is the set of lists with a mix of 0’s and 1’s.

let s be a gene set with m
s genes. as defined in discordance enrichment, let the indicator variable u
s,i= <dig> if the i-th gene in s is showing a list of clearly discordant behaviors, and u
s,i= <dig> otherwise. then, based on the two-level mixture model, the related probability can be calculated as follows. 
 pr=/f,  where  are the related z-scores. let ζ
s,i=p
r, which is a conditional probability according to the given model and observed data.

under the assumption that z-scores from different genes are independent, the discordance enrichment score  for gene set s, which has been defined in discordance enrichment as dess=pr∑i=1msus,i>msθ], can be calculated as follows. 
 dess=∑us,1=01∑us,2=01⋯∑us,ms=01i∑i=1msus,i>msθ∏i=1msζs,ius,i1−us,i,  where i= <dig> and i= <dig> . since {ζ
s,i,i= <dig> ,…,m
s} are usually different for different genes, the above formula is a calculation of a tail probability for a heterogeneous bernoulli process. the related computing issue and the related false discovery rate have already been discussed by lai et al.  <cit> . therefore, we described them briefly as below.

false discovery rate
as discussed in the literature  <cit> , the above enrichment score is a conditional probability and a true positive proportion for gene set s. therefore, the related false discovery rate  <cit>  for the top t gene sets {s
 <dig> s
 <dig> …,s
t} identified by the above des can be conveniently derived as below. 
 fdr=1−∑t=1tdesst/t. 


computational approximation
as discussed in lai et al.  <cit> , the exact calculation of des can be difficult due to the complexity of heterogeneous bernoulli process. a monte carlo approximation has been suggested as follows. first, set an integer variable x= <dig>  for the i-th gene in s, simulate a bernoulli random variable with probability of event ζ
s,i. then, count the number of events from all genes in s, and increase x by one if this number is larger than m
s
θ. repeat the simulation and counting b times and report x/b as the approximated des. b= <dig> was suggested by lai et al.  <cit> .

RESULTS
genome-wide expression data and kegg pathway collection
zhang et al.  <cit>  recently conducted a genome-wide expression study for forty-five matched pairs of pancreatic tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues. the data were collected by the microarray technology  and were made publicly available in the ncbi geo database  <cit> . the collections of gene sets or pathways can be downloaded from the molecular signature database  <cit> . at the time of study, the collections have been updated to version  <dig> . in this study, we focus on  <dig> kegg pathways for our data analysis. there are  <dig> genes available for our discordance enrichment analysis. as we have explained in the methods, we expect to identify pathways with enrichment in clearly discordant gene behaviors among a series of pre-defined genome-wide expression data sets. .

literature support
we have conducted a discordance enrichment analysis based on gene pnlip and a discordance enrichment analysis based on gene tp <dig>  among two lists of identified pathways, there are four in common: neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, olfactory transduction, alpha-linolenic-acid metabolism and linoleic-acid metabolism pathways . to further understand these pathways, we have checked the related biomedical literature.

the genome-wide expression data analyzed in this study were collected based on the microarray technology for rna profiling. genome-wide association study  data have also been collected for pancreatic cancer research based on the microarray technology for dna profiling . wei et al.  <cit>  recently conducted a pathway analysis for a large gwas data on pancreatic cancer research. they reported only two pathways. interestingly, these two pathways are neuroactive ligand receptor interaction and olfactory transduction pathways . notice that their findings were based on a different type of molecular data. this is a strong support for the discordance enrichment analysis results.

we also found at least one support for both alpha-linolenic-acid metabolism and linoleic-acid metabolism pathways. wenger et al.  <cit>  conducted a study on the roles of alpha-linolenic acid  and linoleic acid  on pancreatic cancer and they observed an association between the disease and these two fatty acids.

expression profiles of pnlip vs. tp53

pnlip is a gene shown recently its association with pancreatic cancer  <cit> . tp <dig> is a well-known tumor suppressor gene. from the above comparison, it is interesting that the discordance enrichment analysis results based on pnlip are highly correlated with the discordance enrichment analysis results based on tp <dig>  to further understand this correlation, we compared the expression profile of pnlip with the expression profile of tp <dig>  figure 2
a shows a relatively weak negative correlation  between two lists of paired-ratios but the correlation is not statistically significant . in the non-tumor group , the negative correlation  achieves a p-vlaue  <dig> . in the tumor group , the negative correlation  is again not statistically significant . furthermore, the ratio cutoff values for defining subsets were added to fig. 2
a. a contingency table can be generated according to these grids . the chi-square test for this sparse contingency table is not statistically significant . therefore, in summary, gene pnlip may be negatively associated with gene tp <dig> but no clear statistical significance has been observed in this study.

comparison to gene set analysis
efron and tibshirani  <cit>  have proposed a gene set analysis  method for analyzing enrichment in pathways . it was suggested by maciejewski  <cit>  that this method is preferred in a gene set enrichment analysis. in some situations of integrative data analysis, different data sets cannot be simply pooled together. for each data set, the p-value of enrichment in up-regulation can be obtained for each gene set. to integrate the p-values from multiple data sets , we can consider fisher’s method . log-transformed p-values are summed up and then multiplied by - <dig>  which is well-known to follow a chi-squared distribution under the null hypotheses. in this way, we can perform an integrative gene set enrichment analysis of multiple data sets . gene sets  can be ranked by their chi-squared p-values.  notice that, our analysis purpose is to detect discordance enrichment among multiple data sets. however, the discordance feature is usually not considered in a traditional integrative analysis.

in this study, our analysis results were based on several subsets divided from a genome-wide expression data set with a relatively large sample size. these subsets could be pooled back . therefore, we applied gsa to the original data . however, after considering the adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing, no pathways  could be identified even at the false discovery rate  <dig>  . .

an application to the cancer genome atlas  data sets
for a further illustration of our method, we performed a discordance enrichment analysis of the rna sequencing  data collected by the cancer genome atlas  project  <cit> . at the time of study, with the consideration of adequate numbers of normal/tumor subjects, we selected the rna-seq data for studying prostate adenocarcinoma , colon adenocarcinoma , stomach adenocarcinoma , head and neck squamous cell carcinoma , thyroid carcinoma  and liver hepatocellular carcinoma . among these different types of diseases, we expected a certain level of dissimilarity in genome-wide expression profiles. therefore, we applied our method to these six tcga rna-seq data sets . gene expression profiles for more than  <dig>  common genes were available for our analysis.

among  <dig> kegg pathways, we report the analysis results for a collection of cancer related pathways. there are sixteen of these pathways in kegg but fourteen of them are available in the molecular signatures database  <cit> . in table  <dig>  the discordance enrichment analysis results are also compared to the results based on gsa-based fisher’s method . however, it is important to emphasize that the detection of discordance enrichment is our focus in this study and the feature of discordance is usually not considered in a traditional integrative analysis .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we suggested a discordance gene set enrichment analysis for a series of two-sample genome-wide expression data sets. to reduce the parameter space, we proposed a two-level multivariate normal distribution mixture model. our model is statistically efficient with linearly increased parameter space when the number of data sets is increased. then, gene sets can be detected by the model-based probability of discordance enrichment.

based on our two-level model, if the proportion of complete concordance component is high, then more genes behave concordantly among different data sets. similarly, if the proportion of complete independence component is high, then more genes behave discordantly among different data sets. in the complete concordance component , only complete concordant behaviors are considered: all “up," all “down" or all “null." therefore, there are only three items j= <dig> , <dig> for the outer summation term. for each complete concordant behavior, we have independence among different data sets. statistically, conditional on a underlying complete concordant behavior , we have an inner product term of probability density functions calculated based on different data sets. in the complete independence component , genes behave completely independent among different data sets, which is reflected in the outer product term. for each data set, the underlying behavior for each gene can be “up," “down" or “null." however, the behavior cannot be directly observed and the related probability density function is calculated based on a mixture model.

our method was applied to a microarray expression data set collected for pancreatic cancer research. the data were collected for forty-five matched tumor/non-tumor pairs of tissues. these pairs were first divided into seven subgroups for defining seven subsets of genome-wide expression data, according to the paired expression ratio of gene pnlip. this gene was recently shown its association with pancreatic cancer. our purpose was to understand discordance gene set enrichment when gene pnlip changes its behavior from down-regulation to up-regulation. among a few identified pathways, the neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, olfactory transduction pathways were the most significant two. the alpha-linolenic-acid metabolism and linoleic-acid metabolism pathways were also among the list. to better understand these results, we divided again the original data with forty-five pairs of tumor/non-tumor tissues into six subsets, according to the paired expression ratio of gene tp <dig> . the above four pathways were also identified by the discordance gene set enrichment analysis, with the neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, olfactory transduction pathways still the most significant two. after our literature search, we found that these two pathways were the only two identified for their association with pancreatic cancer in a recent independent pathway analysis of genome-wide association study  data. for the alpha-linolenic-acid metabolism and linoleic-acid metabolism pathways, we found a previous study that the association between pancreatic cancer and these two fatty acids  was observed.

a few discordant behaviors from individual genes can be observed from figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  in fig. 7
p, among genes in the neuroactive ligand receptor interaction pathway , a gene with the most negative z-score in subset  <dig> has the most positive z-score in subset  <dig>  this is a clear change from down-regulation to up-regulation. in fig. 8
a-b, among genes in the olfactory transduction pathway , a gene with the most positive z-score in subset  <dig> has a moderately positive z-score in subset  <dig>  but its z-score in subset  <dig> is clearly negative. this is a clear change from up-regulation to down-regulation.

we conducted a discordance gene set enrichment analysis based on gene pnlip and a discordance gene set enrichment analysis based on gene tp <dig>  only a few among  <dig> kegg pathways were identified. most pathways  were evidently not enriched in discordant gene behaviors. this suggest unique molecular roles of both genes pnlip and tp <dig> in pancreatic cancer development. there were four pathways identified from both analysis results and we found biomedical literature to support the association between pancreatic cancer and these pathways. some pathways identified in one analysis were not identified in the other analysis. it is also biologically interesting to understand these pathways.

it was biologically interesting to observe pathways with clearly discordant gene behaviors when the paired expression ratio of an important disease-related gene was changing. the analysis results in this study illustrated the usefulness of our proposed statistical method. our method was developed based on z-scores that are statistical measures of differential expression, and many existing two-sample statistical tests could be used for generating z-scores. therefore, in this study, we demonstrated our method based on a partition of a relatively large two-sample microarray data set as well as several two-sample genome-wide expression data sets collected by the recent rna-seq technology.

our method is statistically novel for its two-level structure, which is developed based on a biological motivation . due to this two-level structure, the parameter space of our model is increased linearly when the number of data sets is increased. then, the parameter estimates can be statistically efficient. in our mixture model, conditional independence is the key to reduce the complexity of multivariate data analysis. for each gene, when the mixture component information is given for all the data sets, its z-scores are independent. . mathematical and computational convenience is achieved for our statistical model due to this unique feature.

our method is based on the well-established mixture model framework and the expectation-maximization  algorithm for parameter estimation. one limitation is that the proposed three-component mixture model may not fit z-scores well for some data. this can be improved by considering more components in the mixture model. for example, instead of a simple consideration of down-regulation, null and up-regulation, we may consider more components like strong-down-regulation, weak-down-regulation, null, weak-up-regulation and strong-up-regulation. this will only proportionally increase the parameter space .

it is also interesting to extend our method for more complicated analysis purpose. for example, we may be interested in identifying trend changes  instead of general changes. also, for example, we may have multiple data sets collected for different disease stages, but the data set for normal/reference/control stage is not large enough to be divided and it has to be used repeatedly in two-sample comparisons . for these situations, the extension of our method would require a considerable amount of research effort.
