BACKGROUND
chitin is a linear homopolymer of β--linked n-acetyl-d-glucosamine  residues and is the second most abundant organic compound in nature after cellulose  <cit> . this polysaccharide is an important structural component of the cell wall of many fungi and certain algae, the exoskeleton of insects and crustaceans, and the shell of mollusks and nematode eggs. it is also found in the peritrophic matrix, a chitin and glycoprotein layer that lines the midgut of most invertebrates  <cit> .

chitinases  hydrolyze the β--linkages in chitin and chitodextrins, and they are present in organisms from all three domains of life. these enzymes play roles in a variety of processes, such as nutrition, parasitism, defense mechanisms and morphogenesis  <cit> . based on the amino acid sequence similarities of their catalytic domains, chitinases are classified into families  <dig> and  <dig> of the glycoside hydrolases   <cit> . gh <dig> chitinases are widespread in nature, occurring in viruses, archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants  and diverse groups of animals, such as insects and mammals  <cit> . conversely, gh <dig> chitinases have a more restricted distribution, and to date, they have been found in higher plants , nematodes, viruses and some groups of bacteria  <cit> . furthermore, gh <dig> and gh <dig> chitinases have different catalytic mechanisms. gh <dig> members exert the retaining mechanism, in which the products of hydrolysis are β-anomers, whereas gh <dig> members exhibit the inverting mechanism, which produces α-anomers after catalysis  <cit> . additionally, the chitinases of the two families do not share similarities in their amino acid sequences and display completely different three-dimensional structures, suggesting that they diverged from distinct ancestors  <cit> . however, both exo- and endochitinases are found in each family. exochitinases release n,n’-diacetylchitobiose  or n,n’,n”-triacetylchitotriose  from the reducing or non-reducing end of the chitin chain in a processive manner. in contrast, endochitinases cleave chitin randomly at internal sites, producing low molecular mass oligomers that contain  <dig> to  <dig> units of glcnac  <cit> .

chitinases have attracted the interest of biotechnologists because of the many potential applications of these enzymes in medicine, agriculture and industry. for example, the antifungal properties of some bacterial and plant chitinases, which hydrolyze the cell walls of phytopathogenic fungi, have been intensively investigated as an alternative approach to protect crops against fungal diseases  <cit> . moreover, it has been shown that n-acetyl chitooligosaccharides and glcnac, which can be produced from the hydrolysis of chitin by chitinases, possess interesting pharmacological properties that may be relevant for medical applications. n-acetyl chitooligosaccharides, for example, display antibacterial activity  <cit> , while glcnac has been evaluated in clinical trials as a candidate to treat osteoarthritis and other joint disorders as well as inflammatory bowel disease  <cit> .

chromobacterium violaceum is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic β-proteobacterium  that is commonly found as a saprophyte in the water and soil in tropical and subtropical regions  <cit> . the complete genomic sequence of c. violaceum atcc  <dig> has been determined, revealing important molecular clues that underpin the versatility and adaptability of this free-living microorganism  <cit> . in addition to shedding light on particular aspects of the biology of c. violaceum, the analysis of its genome also has revealed many new genes with potential biotechnological applications in medicine, industry, environmental remediation and agriculture  <cit> . of the c. violaceum genes that encode carbohydrate-degrading enzymes, several chitinase genes were identified in the genome of the strain atcc  <dig> 

therefore, the multiple chitinases unveiled by the genomic sequencing of c. violaceum atcc  <dig> may represent a new source of biocontrol molecules against phytopathogens and plant-parasitic nematodes. these chitinases may also have novel enzymatic and biological properties that would justify their future exploitation for practical purposes. however, none of the chitinases encoded by c. violaceum atcc  <dig> has been subjected to experimental validation to date.

the present work aimed to produce one of the chitinolytic enzymes of c. violaceum atcc  <dig> in e. coli. the recombinant protein was efficiently secreted into the culture medium via its native signal peptide and was purified to homogeneity by exploiting its ability to bind to insoluble chitin.

RESULTS
sequence analysis
the orf cv <dig> of c. violaceum atcc  <dig> encodes a putative gh <dig> chitinase  with  <dig> amino acid residues. the predicted pi and molecular mass of the encoded polypeptide chain are  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, respectively. the protein has a modular structure  and is composed of a 23-residue signal peptide at the n-terminus, a chitin-binding domain , followed by a pro/thr/gly-rich linker region , a catalytic domain  at the c-terminal region, and a c-terminal extension . the presence of the signal peptide suggests that the protein is synthesized as a pre-protein that is presumably targeted to the general secretory  pathway of c. violaceum. the protein is herein referred to as cvchi <dig> .

the chitin-binding domain of cvchi <dig>  is a member of the chtbd type  <dig>  superfamily and belongs to carbohydrate-binding module family  <dig>  according to its cazy classification. blast searches against the ncbi protein database detected high identity of the chbdcvchi <dig> to diverse chbds of bacterial origin, such as those found in three chitinases from aeromonas sp. 10s- <dig> , the chbd of a janthinobacterium lividum chitinase  and the chbd of a carbohydrate-binding protein from the clostridium botulinum b <dig> strain okra  . the chtbd <dig> superfamily includes modules of ~40- <dig> residues that bind cellulose and/or chitin. one feature of this chbd is the presence of six conserved aromatic residues  as well as three residues with hydrophobic side chains  that are believed to be important in determining the domain structure and chitin binding ability . for instance, the chbd of bacillus circulans wl- <dig> chitinase a <dig>  has a globular and compact structure with the topology of a twisted β-sandwich and contains two antiparallel β-sheets, which are composed of three and two strands, respectively, and a core region formed by the aromatic and hydrophobic residues  <cit> . the five aromatic  and the three hydrophobic  residues that contribute to the core region of chbdchia <dig> are conserved in the chbdcvchi <dig>  except that cys <dig> is replaced with ala <dig> in the cvchi <dig>  the sixth conserved aromatic residue in the chbdchiaa <dig>  trp <dig>  is located on the surface of the protein where it has a major role in ligand binding, which is most likely mediated by hydrophobic stacking interactions with the pyranose rings of the substrate, as suggested by binding assays and mutagenesis data  <cit> . in chia <dig> of b. circulans wl- <dig> and in other bacterial chitinases, the non-catalytic chbd is important for the interaction of the enzyme with insoluble chitin and is crucial for the efficient hydrolysis of chitin fibers by the catalytic domain  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that in cvchi <dig>  the n-terminal chbd exerts a similar effect.

the chbdcvchi <dig> is connected to the catd by a 31-residue linker sequence that is rich in proline, threonine and glycine . in modular bacterial ghs, such as cellulases, xylanases, and chitinases, flexible disordered segments that are rich in proline and hydroxyamino acid residues  as well as alanine and glycine, which are called pt-rich linkers, are commonly found to connect the non-catalytic substrate-binding domain to the enzymatic domain  <cit> . experimental evidence suggests that these linkers form extended, flexible hinges, which determine the relative orientation of the binding and catalytic domains, thus optimizing the binding and catalytic efficiency of the enzyme on insoluble substrates  <cit> .

the catalytic domain  of cvchi <dig>  comprises ca. 2/ <dig> of the encoded protein, in which the signature pattern of the active site of gh <dig> chitinases  corresponds to the segment 212fdgidldle <dig>  the three consensus motifs that are conserved in the catalytic domains of gh <dig> chitinases are found in the catdcvchi <dig> . these structural motifs are involved in substrate binding  and catalysis , respectively  <cit> . the catalytic domain of gh <dig> chitinases typically adopts a  <dig> triose-phosphate isomerase  barrel fold and uses a general acid/base, substrate-assisted double-displacement hydrolysis mechanism, leading to the retention of the configuration of the anomeric carbon  <cit> . the segment dxxdxdxe forms the β <dig> strand of the 8-barrel and constitutes the core of the catalytic center, in which the glutamic acid residue  is the crucial proton donor for catalysis  <cit> . the two aspartic acid residues  that precede the catalytic glu also play key roles in substrate hydrolysis. the aspartate nearest the catalytic glu is referred to as the stabilizer, and its side-chain is believed to  orient the n-acetyl group of the glcnac residue bound to the − <dig> subsite, favoring the nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl oxygen on its anomeric center;  stabilize the oxazolinium ion intermediate, and  lower the pka of the acid/base glutamate. the second aspartate  is suggested to raise the pka of the stabilizer residue  <cit> . the cvchi <dig> catalytic domain showed higher sequence identity to the gh <dig> domains of chitinases from xanthomonas sp. ak , cellvibrio japonicus ueda <dig>  and chitiniphilus shinanonensis  . significant similarity  was also found between the catd of cvchi <dig> and that of the b. cereus nctu <dig> chitinase , which contains a single catalytic domain without accessory domains and whose three dimensional structure has recently been resolved  <cit> . the 3d structures of wild-type and mutant chinctu <dig> complexes with n-acetyl chitooligosaccharides have allowed for the identification of the key active site residues. the chinctu <dig> residues that play crucial roles in substrate binding and catalysis are also conserved in the catdcvchi <dig> sequence  . these sequence analyses suggest that the cv <dig> orf of c. violaceum atcc  <dig> likely encodes a functional gh <dig> chitinase that contains an accessory domain that is able to bind to chitin.

furthermore, gh <dig> chitinases also differ in the presence or absence of a small -fold domain  within their catds. this domain is ~70- <dig> residues long and is inserted between the β <dig> strand and α <dig> helix of the  <dig> tim-barrel structure of the catd. the -fold insertion domain is located at the top of the  <dig> tim-barrel, creating a deep, tunnel-like substrate-binding cleft. in contrast, chitinases that do not contain this insertion domain have a shallow substrate-binding groove. this difference in the architecture of the substrate-binding groove has been correlated with the exo-type activity of cid-containing chitinases and the endo-type activity of chitinases without the cid  <cit> . because the catdcvchi <dig> does not have this insertion domain , it is likely that this enzyme is an endochitinase. to validate these predictions, the protein encoded by the cv <dig> orf was produced using an e. coli expression system.

recombinant protein expression
an expression vector  containing the entire coding sequence of cvchi <dig>  was obtained, and e. coli bl <dig> cells were transformed with this vector. the expression of the recombinant protein  was achieved by adding iptg to the culture medium. the levels of chitinolytic activity in the e. coli cells transformed with the recombinant plasmid were determined in a time-course experiment. the total chitinase activity against colloidal chitin, which was detected in soluble intracellular extracts from the transformed cells, was very low  even after 24 h of induction. comparable background levels were also observed in intracellular extracts from control cells  cultivated under the same conditions. however, high levels of chitinolytic activity  were detected in the cell-free culture supernatant of e. coli cells transformed with pet-cv <dig> after iptg induction. the chitinolytic activity in the extracellular fraction of the recombinant e. coli cells was detected as early as 2 h after induction and increased thereafter until 24 h. in contrast, chitinase activity was almost absent  in the cell-free culture supernatant of e. coli cells transformed with the empty vector and cultivated under the same experimental conditions . these results suggest that the secretion of rcvchi <dig> by the e. coli cells was directed by its native signal peptide.

to determine the ability of the e. coli cells to secrete the recombinant chitinase, fractions from culture medium and cells were harvested at 24 h after induction, and analyzed by sds-page and western blotting. coomassie brilliant blue staining revealed a protein band with an apparent molecular mass of approximately  <dig>  kda that was evident only in the cell-free culture supernatant of e. coli cells transformed with pet-cv <dig> and induced with iptg . this  <dig>  kda protein band reacted specifically with an anti-his <dig> tag antibody, and this reaction was not observed in the soluble intracellular extract and the periplasm fraction of e. coli cells containing pet-cv <dig> . the total chitinolytic activity was also measured in these fractions at 24 h after induction. the highest proportion  of the hydrolytic activity was found in the growth medium, with minor amounts in the periplasmic fraction  and the soluble cell lysate . therefore, approximately 93% of the soluble recombinant chitinase produced by the e. coli was exported, and the majority of the exported fraction present in the periplasmic space was secreted into the culture medium.

to evaluate if the level of recombinant chitinase secreted by the e. coli could be increased with the use of terrific broth , a growth medium that is richer than lysogeny broth  and that supports higher cell densities, a comparative time-course induction experiment was carried out. higher levels of total soluble protein  were secreted by the e. coli cells transformed with pet-cv <dig> and cultivated in tb compared to transformed cells grown in lb medium and incubated under the same conditions. however, the activity of the chitinase secreted by the transformed cells cultivated in tb was lower  than that in the extracellular fraction of cells grown in lb . in both conditions, the highest protein concentration and chitinolytic activity in the cell-free medium were observed 24 h after induction, and these levels decreased thereafter. we next aimed to purify the recombinant protein secreted into the culture medium using induced e. coli cells grown in lb for 24 h.

purification and characterization
to purify the c. violaceum chitinase produced in e. coli, the secreted recombinant protein was recovered from the cell-free culture supernatant by ammonium sulfate precipitation and further purified by single-step affinity chromatography on a chitin matrix. after washing out the unbound proteins  with equilibration buffer , pure recombinant chitinase was eluted  by washing the column with  <dig>  m acetic acid, as shown by sds-page . a small amount of chitinolytic activity was detected in the pooled fractions of p <dig>  but this value was approximately 1% of the total activity in the pooled fractions of p <dig>  showing that the binding of rcvchi <dig> to the chitin matrix was effective. a purification factor of  <dig> -fold was obtained, and ca. 60% of the total chitinolytic activity which was present in the cell-free culture supernatant was recovered. the yield of purified recombinant protein was ca. 4 mg per liter of induced culture, which represents approximately 7% of the total protein content in the concentrated cell-free culture medium. when submitted to electrophoresis under denaturing conditions , the purified protein migrated as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of approximately  <dig>  kda, instead of  <dig>  kda, the expected size of the 439-residue precursor encoded by the dna sequence cloned into the expression vector. however, taking into account the extra residues at the c-terminus  corresponding to the his-tag sequence added to the recombinant protein, this value  is in good agreement with the predicted molecular mass  calculated for the expressed his-tagged fusion protein without its native signal peptide. the n-terminal sequence of the purified recombinant chitinase secreted into the culture medium was determined to be: acpgewaegtaykvgdvvsynnanytalvahtayvganwn. this sequence corresponds to a 40-residue segment of the pre-protein, from ala <dig> to asn <dig>  excluding the first  <dig> residues, as highlighted in figure  <dig>  the presence of a signal peptide at the n-terminal region of the protein sequence encoded by orf cv <dig> was predicted by the signalp software . furthermore, three most likely cleavage sites for type i signal peptidase  were predicted within the first  <dig> residues in the precursor sequence of cvchi <dig>  these sites were located between ala21-trp <dig> , ala23-ala <dig>  and ala24-ala <dig> . as shown by the experimentally determined amino terminal sequence, the native signal peptide was cleaved between ala24-ala <dig>  which was the second most likely spase i cleavage site as predicted by the neural network model of the signalp algorithm. thus, the native signal peptide in the precursor sequence of cvchi <dig> was recognized by the general secretory apparatus of the e. coli and directed the secretion of the expressed protein into the culture medium. moreover, the signal peptide of cvchi <dig> was correctly processed to produce a mature extracellular enzyme with chitinolytic and chitin-binding activities.

to further characterize the recombinant chitinase, the effects of temperature, ph, and metal ions on its hydrolytic activity were evaluated. the purified enzyme was relatively thermostable, retaining approximately 32% of its activity after being heated to 60°c for 30 min. enzymatic activity was completely lost when the incubation was carried out at 70°c or higher for 30 min . the chitinolytic activity of the purified cvchi <dig> was detected over a wide ph range , but there was no activity detected at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> ; the maximum relative activity was recorded at ph  <dig> , with significant hydrolysis of colloidal chitin also detected at ph  <dig>   and  <dig>   . most of the tested metal ions  as well as the monovalent cation nh4+ did not affect the hydrolytic activity of cvchi <dig> against pnp- <dig> and pnp- <dig> at a concentration of 5 mm. however, mn2+ and fe2+ were effective in reducing the hydrolytic activity against both pnp- <dig>  and pnp- <dig>  . there was no inhibitory effect of 5 mm edta or 5% β-mercaptoethanol on the enzymatic activity of cvchi <dig> against the two chromogenic n-acetyl-chitooligosaccharide analogues. in contrast,  <dig> % sds completely abolished the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze pnp- <dig> and pnp- <dig> 

the substrate specificity of cvchi <dig> was investigated by colorimetric assays using colloidal chitin and synthetic analogues  of n-acetyl-chitooligosaccharides as substrates . in the enzymatic assay using colloidal chitin as a substrate, free glcnac monomers were detected only when helix pomatia β-glucuronidase was added to the reaction mixture, after the initial incubation of the enzyme sample with the substrate. thus, the hydrolytic activity of cvchi <dig> on chitin chains liberated water-soluble chitin oligomers, which were converted to free glcnac by the β-glucuronidase. this result also reveals the lack of β-n-acetylglucosaminidase  activity . glcnacases remove β-linked glcnac from the non-reducing end of different substrates including oligosaccharides, for example. these enzymes are classified into families gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig>  and although some of them are involved in the degradation of chitin, they are not chitinases  <cit> . the substrate specificity of rcvchi <dig> was further examined using chromogenic analogues of di- , tri-  and tetra-oligomers  of glcnac as substrates. there was no detectable activity against pnp-glcnac, indicating an absence of glcnacase activity, which is consistent with the result found in the assay using colloidal chitin as a substrate. on the other hand, high specific activities were found against pnp- <dig> and pnp- <dig>  respectively. the recombinant enzyme exhibited almost the same specific activity against both of these substrates. the results suggest that cvchi <dig> cleaves internal o-glycosidic linkages, thus removing the n,n’-diacetylchitobiose and n,n’-,n”-triacetychitotriose moieties from the non-reducing end of n-acetyl chitooligomers and chitin.

the specific activity  of the purified chitinase was measured using colloidal chitin and synthetic substrates as described in the methods section. a chitinase from streptomyces griseus  was included for comparison.

* for assays using colloidal chitin as the substrate , one unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that released 1 nmol of glcnac/mg/h at 37°c.

** for assays using synthetic substrates, one unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that released 1 nmol of 4-nitrophenol/mg/h at 37°c; the substrates were assayed at final concentrations of  <dig>  mm ,  <dig>  mm , and  <dig>  mm ; nd: not detected.

discussion
large amounts of chitin are produced in nature by living organisms, especially by fungi and invertebrates, such as insects, crustaceans and mollusks. it has been estimated that more than  <dig> metric tons of this polysaccharide are generated annually only in the aquatic biosphere  <cit> . chitinolytic bacteria play a crucial role in recycling the chitinous structures that are continuously produced in various ecosystems  <cit> . to degrade chitin, bacteria secrete chitinases that hydrolyze the polysaccharide to soluble oligosaccharides, mostly n,n’-diacetylchitobiose. these oligosaccharides are then metabolized by glcnacases to yield the monosaccharide glcnac. chromobacterium violaceum is a saprophyte bacterium found in the soil and water and is able to use chitin as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen  <cit> . c. violaceum produces multiple extracellular chitinases that are involved in this physiological process  <cit> .

in this work, a gh <dig> chitinase  encoded in the genome of c. violaceum atcc  <dig> was produced and efficiently secreted into the culture medium of e. coli bl <dig> cells. the c. violaceum chitinase was directed to the extracellular medium by its native signal peptide , which was properly removed during the secretion of the pre-protein. translocation across the inner cell membrane of e. coli has been reported for chitinases from diverse bacteria such as aeromonas caviae <cit> , a. hydrophila <cit> , alteromonas sp. strain o- <dig>  <cit> , b. cereus <cit> , b. circulans <cit> , enterobacter agglomerans <cit> , janthinobacterium lividum <cit> , s. marcescens <cit> , streptomyces plicatus <cit> , and vibrio parahaemolyticus <cit> . in all these studies, the translocation of the enzymes across the inner cell membrane of e. coli was mediated by the native signal peptides. once exported by e. coli, some of these chitinases remained in the periplasm  <cit>  but others were secreted into the culture medium  <cit> .

one can speculate that in strain atcc  <dig>  the c. violaceum chitinase encoded by orf cv <dig> is most likely involved in the first hydrolytic reactions that lead to the depolymerization of chitin. another plausible hypothesis is that once secreted, this c. violaceum chitinase might also have an antagonistic activity on fungi and nematode eggs, as reported for some soil strains of chromobacterium <cit> .

the recombinant product cvchi <dig> was purified to homogeneity by a single-step procedure that employed affinity chromatography on a chitin matrix. the interaction between the recombinant chitinase and the matrix of insoluble chitin was likely mediated by the chbd present in cvchi <dig>  the purified recombinant protein displayed highest chitinolytic activity at ph  <dig> , and this characteristic may have physiological significance because c. violaceum and other chromobacterium species are known to thrive in aquatic and terrestrial sites with acidic ph  <cit> . the acidic ph-optimum of gh <dig> chitinases like cvchi <dig>  hevamine  <cit>  and ech <dig>   <cit>  is probably due to a conserved asn residue  near the catalytic glu. chib from s. marcescens, which contains an asp at this position , has a broad ph-activity profile and shows highest activity at neutral ph. substitution of asp <dig> for asn yielded an acidic chib mutant, with very low activity at ph  <dig>  but significant  activity at ph  <dig>   <cit> .

the enzymatic activity of cvchi <dig> was not inhibited by the metal ion-chelating compound edta or the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol, suggesting that metal ions and disulfide bonds may not be important in the stability and/or activity of cvchi <dig>  on the other hand, the divalent metal ions mn2+ and fe2+ caused significant reductions in the hydrolytic activity of cvchi <dig>  this inhibitory effect probably involves the interaction of these divalent cations with the negatively-charged carboxylate residues in the chitinase active center. this assumption is based on previous observations that divalent metal ions are able to form stable complexes with carboxylic groups at the active sites of enzymes, as investigated in hen egg-white lysozyme  <cit> . altogether, these results confirm the functional predictions that are based on sequence comparisons between the primary structures of cvchi <dig> and previously characterized bacterial chitinases.

the sequence of the signal peptide of cvchi <dig> is  <dig> residues long, and the n-, h- and c-regions are  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> residues in length, respectively. three arg residues are found in the n-region of spcvchi <dig>  giving it a net positive charge of + <dig>  in the sec-dependent type i sps of e. coli , these positively charged residues maintain electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged phospholipids of the inner membrane  <cit> . the basic residues in the n-region of spiec also promote the association of the preprotein-secb complex with seca  <cit> . in the h-region of spcvchi <dig>  ala  and leu  occur almost in the same proportion and are the most frequent residues, a profile that is similar to that found in spiec. the stretch of hydrophobic residues in the h-region of spiec binds to a hydrophobic peptide-binding groove in the seca structure and adopts an α-helical conformation in the inner membrane  <cit> . two α-helix-breaking gly residues  flank the h-region of spcvchi <dig>  one residue on each side of the central hydrophobic core. the gly residue at the - <dig> position defines the border between the h- and c-regions. a similar profile is observed in the boundary between the h-region and the c-region of spiec, where an α-helix-destabilizing residue  often occurs at or around the - <dig> position  <cit> . the c-region of spcvchi <dig> has a predominance of ala residues and the - <dig> and - <dig> positions  are occupied by ala and trp residues, respectively. in comparison, these positions in the c-region of spiec are occupied by residues with small aliphatic or polar side-chains. because alanine is most often found at the - <dig> and - <dig> positions, the spase i cleavage site specificity is usually referred to as the ala-x-ala rule  <cit> . moreover, the first  <dig> residues of the mature protein cvchi <dig> have a negative net charge , a feature that has been shown to be important for protein secretion in e. coli and other gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . thus, spcvchi <dig> is a type i sp that directs the export or secretion of proteins through the sec pathway and is removed by signal peptidase i. because spcvchi <dig> possesses the major features of a prototypical e. coli type i sp, one can suggest that this concurrence of physico-chemical properties underlies the efficient secretion of the c. violaceum chitinase by e. coli. once it has been folded in the e. coli periplasm, the recombinant protein most likely reaches the culture medium by nonspecific periplasmic leakage or through the second step of a type ii secretion system  <cit> .

high expression levels of foreign proteins in e. coli often lead to their accumulation in intracellular inclusion bodies. as a consequence, in vitro refolding of these insoluble proteins is necessary to restore their biological activity. one strategy to overcome this problem is the secretion of the heterologous protein into the culture medium. some advantages of this approach include: more simple purification schemes, enhanced biological activity, higher stability and solubility of the expressed protein, and n-terminal authenticity of the recombinant product  <cit> . among the signal sequences that have been used to secrete recombinant proteins in e. coli, we can cite, for example, those from the proteins ompa, phoa, spa , and pelb   <cit> . however, the discovery of new signal peptides that are functional in e. coli is still a relevant matter. first, the efficiency of a signal sequence to direct the secretion of a target protein cannot be anticipated from the analysis of the properties of its sequence alone. second, there is no guarantee that a signal sequence that is suitable for the secretion of a given protein will have the same efficiency to direct the secretion of a different one. therefore, several signal peptides must be evaluated through a trial-and-error approach.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, the functionality of a gh <dig> chitinase  that is encoded in the genome of c. violaceum atcc  <dig> was experimentally demonstrated using heterologous expression in e. coli bl <dig> cells. the native signal peptide allowed for the secretion of the recombinant product into the culture medium to a level of 4 mg/l in shake flask cultures. the signal sequence was correctly removed during secretion, and the mature protein in the extracellular medium was soluble, bound insoluble chitin and hydrolyzed colloidal chitin and synthetic analogues of n-acetyl chitooligosaccharides. the chitinase was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and showed an apparent molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. the protein cvchi <dig> possesses promising functional domains that should be further studied, aiming for their exploitation as molecular tools for the heterologous expression in e. coli of foreign proteins with biotechnological applications.
