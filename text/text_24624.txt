BACKGROUND
approximately one-third of the world's population is infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis and  <dig>  almost  <dig> million cases of tuberculosis emerged, resulting in an estimated  <dig>  million deaths  <cit> . typical treatments require combination drug therapies taken over a period of 6– <dig> months. the global economic burden of tuberculosis amounts to approximately $ <dig> billion annually. the need for novel chemotherapeutics in the treatment of infection by m. tuberculosis is clearly demonstrated by its high infectivity rate and prolonged and extensive therapy requirements.

the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways are attractive, established targets for chemotherapeutic treatment  <cit> . isoprenoids are building blocks for several biologically or commercially important compounds, including steroids, flavoring compounds like limonene, and natural medicinal products like taxol  <cit> . cells are dependent on isoprenoid derivatives for critical functions like growth, hormone-based signaling, differentiation, maintenance of homeostasis, and electron transport in respiration and photosynthesis  <cit> . in mycobacteria species, isoprenoid biosynthesis is particularly important for the synthesis of the cell wall, including mycolic acids and lipoarabinomannan  <cit> . the universal precursors of isoprenoids are the isomers isopentenyl pyrophosphate  and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate . synthesis of these precursors occurs via two distinct biochemical pathways. in mammals, fungi, the cytoplasm of plants, and archaebacteria, synthesis occurs via the mevalonate pathway  <cit> , and, in chloroplasts, algae, cyanobacteria, apicomplexa and most eubacteria , via the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate  or non-mevalonate pathway  <cit> . fosmidomycin is an inhibitor of the third enzyme in the doxp pathway, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase, and has been used against infections by plasmodium species  <cit> . since the compound is a clinically approved antibacterial agent then there is chemical validation of this stage of the pathway for drug development. recently, the crystal structure of the m. tuberculosis reductoisomerase has been determined opening up routes to structure-based inhibitor discovery methods targeting that particular stage of the pathway  <cit> .

eight enzymes are involved in the synthesis of ipp and dmapp via the doxp pathway  <cit> . ispf, or 2c-methyl-d-erythritol- <dig> -cylodiphosphate  synthase, is the fifth enzyme of the pathway. structural and biochemical studies, in particular on the escherichia coli enzyme , demonstrate that ispf directs an intramolecular attack of the 2-phosphate on the internal β-phosphate of the substrate, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2c-methyl-d-erythritol-2-phosphate , to form mecdp and cmp . ispf depends on two divalent cations to orient and polarize the substrate during catalysis  <cit>  in gram-negative bacteria and mycobacteria species, ispf is found in a putative operon with ispd, which encodes the third enzyme in the doxp pathway  <cit> . genetic studies indicate that ispf is essential in e. coli as well as bacillus subtilis  <cit>  and partial depletion of ispf in these bacteria increases sensitivity to cell wall-active antibiotics  <cit> . in larger genomic scale hybridization studies, failure to insert a transposon into the ispf gene also suggests it is essential in haemophilus influenzae  <cit>  and m. tuberculosis  <cit> .

these observations, in conjunction with the absence of this enzyme from humans, demonstrate the importance of ispf as a novel target for drug discovery. the structure of ecispf has provided a model for rational ligand design  <cit>  and a high throughput screen has been developed to enable ligand discovery  <cit> . little information is available for m. tuberculosis ispf  and earlier genetic studies only suggest that ispf is essential in this organism. here, we prove that ispf is essential in m. tuberculosis. furthermore, for use as a model in structure-based ligand design, we present a structure of the orthologue, mycobacterium smegmatis ispf , bound to cdp.

RESULTS
ispf essentiality in m. tuberculosis
we exploited our previously described methods  <cit>  to determine whether ispf was essential in m. tuberculosis. initially, we attempted to construct a knockout mutant using a two-step homologous recombination procedure. the two-step method employed the use of a suicide  construct containing an in-frame deletion of the ispf gene . the construct  was introduced into wild-type m. tuberculosis and single crossover  recombinant strains obtained. one sco strain was used to isolate double crossover  recombinants; in the absence of antibiotic selection, dco recombinants could have either the wild type or the deletion alleles. we screened  <dig> dco recombinants; all had the wild-type gene.

the failure to isolate a deletion strain suggested that ispf is essential in axenic culture. to verify this hypothesis, we made a merodiploid strain in which an additional functional copy of ispd and ispf were introduced into the sco strain on an l5-derived integrating vector under the control of the mycobacterial antigen 85a promoter . the resulting strain had one deleted and two functional copies of ispf. double crossovers generated from the merodiploid strain were isolated as before. screening by pcr demonstrated that 19/ <dig> dcos had the wild-type gene and 5/ <dig> had the deletion allele . the genotypes of the transformants with the deletion allele were confirmed by southern hybridization . since the chromosomal copy of ispf could only be deleted when a second functional copy was provided, this proved the essentiality of ispf in m. tuberculosis.

a mycobacteria model for structure-based studies
that ispf is essential in m. tuberculosis validates the encoded enzyme as a chemotherapeutic target. we tried to determine the structure of mtispf to aid in rational ligand design, but the protein, though efficiently produced in recombinant form, was recalcitrant to crystallization. mtispf has 73% amino acid identity to msispf, so we chose to study the orthologue on the basis that it would provide a suitable model of the pathogen enzyme. the recombinant msispf is produced in high yield , can be purified readily and provided well-ordered single crystals. a surface model of msispf, which is colored by shared identity with mtispf, highlights the strong resemblance between these sequences, particularly at the active site . generally, an accurate homology model is attainable in high sequence identity  cases  <cit>  and the use of such models has been successful in structure-based ligand design. in certain cases, even with <60% sequence identity, homology models have been found useful. examples being human carbonic anhydrase  <cit>  and rho kinase  <cit>  where models were constructed from sequences that shared only 38% and 37% identity, respectively.

overall structure
the structure of msispf bound to cdp was determined to a resolution of  <dig>  Å. there are three subunits  in the asymmetric unit, forming a homotrimer about a non-crystallographic axis. the model comprises residues 3– <dig> for each subunit, with residues 36– <dig> absent in chains a and b. structures of several ligand-bound and native forms of ispf from campylobacter jejuni, e. coli,h. influenzae, shewanella oneidensis, and thermus thermophilus are available in the protein data bank . ecispf  was chosen as the model for the structural comparisons to follow because it was built using high-resolution data  and contains the ligand cdp. the two sequences share 38% identity, and the r.m.s.d. values for the superposition of the msispf onto the ecispf trimer range from  <dig> – <dig>  Å, depending upon which chains are aligned.

msispf closely resembles ecispf  <cit> . each subunit displays an α/β fold which contains six β-strands, five α-helices, and two  <dig> helices . four of the strands  comprise a central β-sheet that packs against the α- and  <dig> helices. the other two strands form a short sheet at the end of a loop that extends into the space between α <dig>  α <dig>  and α <dig>  one  <dig> helix  of msispf overlays with that of ecispf , but the second  occurs between α <dig> and α <dig> rather than following α <dig> 

trimer formation arises from edge-to-face packing of the β-sheets, with the largest section of the interface occurring between β <dig> and β <dig> of adjacent subunits . thus, the interior shape of the trimer resembles a trigonal prism whose faces are comprised of β-sheets from the individual subunits. the msispf trimer has the same overall dimensions as ecispf, measuring approximately  <dig> Å in height along the three-fold symmetry axis and  <dig> Å in diameter at the widest point perpendicular to this axis. in addition, like the e. coli enzyme, most of the hydrogen bonds between the subunits involve side chain interactions. the trimer interface interactions also resemble those of e. coli in that they are primarily hydrophobic; approximately 65% of atoms comprising both of these enzyme interfaces are non-polar. e. coli and m. smegmatis are mesophiles. in contrast, only 58% of atoms in the interface of ispf from the thermophile t. thermophilus are non-polar  <cit> .

hydrophobic cavity
at the center of the trimer is a hydrophobic cavity that opens toward the c-terminal ends of β <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig>  side chains of residues thr <dig>  val <dig>  ile <dig>  thr <dig>  leu <dig> and thr <dig> from each subunit line the interior of the cavity while two arginines  and the main chain of gly <dig> and leu <dig> of subunit c shape the aperture . arg <dig> is held in place through an electrostatic attraction to glu <dig>  in ecispf, a salt-bridge between arg142-glu <dig> from all three subunits forms the aperture. here, subunit c is less ordered and this contributes to the observed asymmetry. the density is poorly defined between residues 137– <dig> in subunit c and the average thermal parameter for this region  is much higher than in subunits a  and b .

the distance from the base of the cavity to the opening  and the diameter of the aperture  are comparable to those observed in ecispf. the volume of the cavity of msispf , however, is significantly larger than that of ecispf . in ecispf the cavity is ellipsoidal and the floor parabolic; the major axis of the ellipsoid runs from the aperture to the floor of the cavity  <cit> . in msispf the cavity is trigonal pyramidal, with the aperture corresponding to the tip of the pyramid and the floor to the base. residue differences in the lining of the cavity contribute to shape and diameter variation. in e. coli, the cavity is lined with the side chains of six large hydrophobic residues, phe <dig> and phe <dig> from each subunit, whereas the corresponding residues in msispf are thr <dig> and leu <dig>  in ecispf, the floor of the cavity is sealed by three his5-glu <dig> salt bridges  <cit> . hydrophobic interactions seal the floor of msispf. here, residues leu <dig> and ile <dig> replace the ecispf salt-bridge. the cavity in mtipsf should bear a strong resemblance to that in msispf since the residues that contribute to the lining  are strictly identical in the two sequences .

in common with crystal structures of other ispf trimers, non-protein electron density was observed in the hydrophobic cavity of msispf. in ecispf, phosphate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, gpp, and ipp have been shown to bind within this cavity  <cit> . there is as yet no evidence to prove that ligand binding here regulates enzyme activity. the cavity is distant from the three catalytic sites but since, as will be explained, oligomerisation is required to generate the functional enzyme then occupancy of the hydrophobic cleft may contribute to the stability of the ispf trimer.

in msispf the density observed in the cavity is diffuse and we presume that a similar mixture of ligands may be present. ipp was modeled into this density at 50% occupancy based on fit and ligand identification in the ecispf cavity. although a methodical and thorough approach was used in fitting the ligand, the thermal parameters of ipp  exceed the average of the protein . the ligand-protein interactions, though not clearly defined, do resemble those observed in ecispf . the guanidino groups of arg <dig> from two subunits bind to the β-phosphate; in ecispf, the side chain from the corresponding residue  of all three subunits contributes to this interaction. in msispf, the bridging phosphodiester oxygen of ipp binds to the amide of leu <dig> in subunit c and one of the α-phosphate oxygens binds to the main chain amide of leu <dig> in subunit b. in ecispf, these ligand atoms interact with the main chain amide of the corresponding residue  of all three subunits.

active site
there are three active sites in the trimer, each located at the interface between two adjacent subunits. the active site  comprises a rigid nucleotide and cation  binding pocket and a flexible loop for binding the me2p moiety of substrate  <cit> . only one of the two cation-binding sites, the zn2+ site, is occupied here  <cit> . this cation is approximately 75% occupied in two subunits and 50% occupied in the third. the zn2+ displays tetrahedral coordination, in similar fashion to that observed in other ispf structures, by asp <dig>  his <dig>  his <dig>  and the β-phosphate of cdp. in the higher resolution model of ecispf, the second cation  is coordinated by the side chain of glu <dig> and two oxygens from the diphosphate of cdp. in msispf and mtispf, the glutamate is replaced with aspartate. this residue is strictly conserved as an aspartate or glutamate across  <dig> ispf sequences , suggesting that a negative charge is required to coordinate the second cation and that either negatively charged amino acid will suffice. in the structure of msispf, the lower resolution data or cdp disorder may preclude identification of the second cation .

two conformers of cdp, each at approximately half occupancy, are present in each of the three active sites of the trimer. we only show one conformer in figures  <dig> and  <dig> for the purpose of clarity. in the conformers, the ligand-protein interactions are maintained for the pyrimidine and the ribose but diverge at the diphosphate. the average thermal parameters of the conformers, hereby referred to as cdp-a and cdp-b, are  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å <dig>  respectively. the presence of cdp disorder is likely linked to the incompletely occupied zn2+ binding site. the mode of ligand binding of cdp-b more closely resembles that observed in ecispf . in this mode, three interactions are present between the protein and ligand diphosphate. two of these are hydrogen bonds formed between the α-phosphate and the side chain hydroxyl and main chain amide of the strictly conserved thr <dig>  the third is ligand-metal ion coordination between the β-phosphate and the active site zn2+. the interaction between the zn2+ and the β-phosphate is preserved in cdp-a, but an additional hydrogen bond occurs between the β-phosphate and the hydroxyl group of thr <dig>  in cdp-a, the α-phosphate also forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain hydroxyl of thr <dig>  but the bridging diphosphate oxygen interacts with the main chain amide of this residue and the side chain of thr <dig> instead.

the architecture of the active site at the cytosine and zn2+ binding sites and the interactions formed with cdp by msispf are similar to that observed in ecispf. furthermore, msispf residues that contribute to this binding site are all identical or conserved in mtispf . the cytosine is bound in an aliphatic pocket created by side chains of residues from β <dig> and the loop between β <dig> and θ <dig> from a single subunit. the cytidine is stacked between the side chains of ala <dig> and lys <dig>  which are strictly conserved in e. coli and m. tuberculosis. both binding sites in ecispf and msispf are characterized by four hydrogen bonds between the pyrimidine and main chain atoms of the protein. in msispf, these backbone atoms are from residues gly <dig>  pro <dig>  val <dig> and gly <dig>  and, in ecispf, ala <dig>  pro <dig>  met <dig>  and leu <dig>  these residues are strictly conserved in msispf and mtispf with the exception that mtispf ile <dig> replaces msispf val <dig> .

because the interactions involve backbone atoms, high conservation of these residues is not necessarily required. the critical elements required to maintain similar protein-ligand interactions are the shape and size of the cytosine pocket. two pairs of hydrophobic interactions contribute to this function in msispf. one pair of hydrophobic interactions occurs between the side chains of pro <dig> and leu <dig> and the second between the side chains of val <dig> and val <dig>  both sets of residues are highly conserved  in  <dig> ispf sequences, including both e. coli and m. tuberculosis. the first is conserved as a proline-leucine/isoleucine pair and the second as two aliphatic residues, where the identities of the residues are leucine, methionine, valine, isoleucine, or phenylalanine.

the ribose hydroxyls are oriented by several hydrophilic interactions involving strictly conserved residues in msispf, ecispf and mtispf. the ribose hydroxyls form hydrogen bonds with the side chain of asp59*  and the amide of gly61*, and solvent-mediated interactions are observed with the side chain of asp49* and the carbonyl of ala <dig> . moreover, in msispf and ecispf, the side chain orientation of asp59* is maintained through hydrophilic interactions. here, this aspartate accepts hydrogen bonds donated by amides of gly61*, thr62*, and ala <dig> and the side chain of thr62*, and, in ecispf, with the amides of gly58*, lys59*, and ala <dig>  the msispf residues that contribute to the orientation of asp59* are strictly conserved in the sequence of mtispf except for thr62*, which is a glutamate in the latter. main chain atoms are the primary contributors to stabilization of asp59*, so this amino acid replacement is unlikely to affect conformation or function.

the nucleotide-binding pocket is only part of the active site. in ecispf the remaining fragment of substrate, me2p, is bound by contributions from α <dig>  α <dig>  and residues 33– <dig>  and a flexible loop, which comprises residues 61– <dig>  <cit> . the largest cα r.m.s.d. differences between ecispf and msispf occur in this loop. in ecispf, the loop is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the side chain of his34* and the carbonyl atoms of asp63* and asp65*. his34* is conserved in msispf , but the aspartates are not. here, no well-defined density is observed for his37* in two of the trimer subunits. in the third, the side chain of this residue forms hydrogen bonds to the main chain carbonyl of arg68* and the side chain of asp67*. the former resembles the ecispf his34*-asp65* interaction, but the latter reflects the different conformations of this loop present in the two orthologues. this loop is further stabilized in msispf by a hydrophilic interaction between the carbonyl of ile63* and the side chain of arg68*, a residue which is not conserved in ecispf. the stabilization of the loop through hydrogen bonding to the side chain of an aspartate as observed in msispf can be maintained in mtispf as this residue is identical, but the arginine is replaced by a second aspartate. although the main chain interactions might be preserved by an aspartate, the side chain interactions could not.

me2p is oriented by several hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with ecispf  <cit> . the amides of ser35* and his34* and the hydroxyl of ser35* form hydrogen bonds with oxygens of the attacking 2-phosphate group. the identities of these residues and the positions of the residues that bind and orient the attacking 2-phosphate group are maintained in msispf . in ecispf, the side chains of ile57* and leu76* make van der waals contacts with the methyl group of me2p. these residues are replaced by another hydrophobic pair, leu60* and met78*, in msispf. when a model of ecispf containing substrate  is superimposed onto msispf, these residues are able to maintain contact with the methyl group of me2p. the 3-hydroxyl group of the ligand interacts with the carbonyl of phe <dig> in ecispf. this residue is part of the flexible loop, and the equivalent residue in msispf  does not maintain this interaction in the superposition. phe64* is preceded by a glycine in msispf and a proline in ecispf. glycine flexibility would permit a conformational change to accommodate interactions between phe64* and the ligand. alternatively, there is a hydrogen bond present between the carbonyl of gly65* and the 3-hydroxyl group of the superimposed substrate. the aforementioned residues corresponding to those observed in msispf are all identical in mtispf except for leu60*, which is an isoleucine instead. the binding component of this residue, the side chain hydrophobicity, is maintained in mtispf, as this residue is also an isoleucine in e. coli and is strictly conserved as isoleucine, leucine, or valine in  <dig> ispf sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
there is an urgent need to identify new targets and to develop new treatments for tuberculosis. our work demonstrates that ispf is essential in m. tuberculosis, thus establishing it as a potentially valuable target for chemotherapeutic intervention. in addition, we have determined the crystal structure of the closely related orthologue msispf bound to cdp. the protein is a homotrimer with three equivalent active sites formed at the subunit interfaces. each active site bears a strong resemblance to those observed in other ispf structures, presenting a rigid cdp-zn2+ binding-pocket and a flexible substrate-binding loop. mtispf and msispf share 73% sequence identity, and, of the eleven residues in the active site that bind cdp, ten are identical and the eleventh highly conserved. based on the high degree of similarity between the orthologues, particularly in the active site, the structure of msispf provides a suitable template for structure-based inhibitor design targeting the pathogenic organism m. tuberculosis.
