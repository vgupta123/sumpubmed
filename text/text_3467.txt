BACKGROUND
pakistan, together with other asian countries including; china, india, bangladesh, and indonesia, shares over  <dig> percent of the global burden of the tuberculosis  cases  <cit> . pakistan ranks sixth amongst the  <dig> high burden tb disease countries  <cit> , with an estimated incidence rate of 171/ <dig>  population. despite this the tb burden is an underestimated figure as many cases in the country go unreported due to lack of access to health care facility, over crowding, poverty and other social constraints.

the high incidence of tuberculosis in pakistan is further compounded by the increasing emergence of drug resistant strains including multi-drug resistant  strains. the global prevalence of mdr is estimated at 3%  <cit> . however china, iran and india report mdr-tb at  <dig> %, 5% and  <dig> % respectively  <cit> . while community based data from pakistan is currently not available, laboratory based studies from urban rawalpindi showed an increasing frequency of mdr from 14% in  <dig> to 28% in  <dig>  <cit>  and a study from a tertiary care center in karachi documented 47% mdr-tb prevalence  <cit> .

key factors required for effective control of tb are rapid detection, adequate therapy and a better understanding of tb epidemiology to understand the transmission patterns of the disease. mycobacterium tuberculosis , the main causative agent of tb has an overall genomic similarity of  <dig> %  <cit> . there is moreover increasing evidence that specific genetic differences within mtb may be associated with geographical locations  <cit> . thus studies of the genetic diversity of mtb in a high burden country such as pakistan are required in order to provide insight into dissemination dynamics and virulence pattern of the pathogen.

genotyping methods such as pcr based spacer oligonucleotide typing  have facilitated differentiation of mtb isolates into predominant genogroups including, the beijing family of strains and central asian strain <dig> . we have reported cas <dig> strains lacking spacers 4– <dig> and 23– <dig> to be the most prevalent  in pakistan  <cit> . cas <dig> has also been reported as the second most predominant group in south asia; india  and bangladesh   <cit> . whilst, beijing strains lacking spacers 1– <dig> are the most widely reported genotype world wide  <cit>  and the most prevalent genotype in east asia and russia   <cit> , they constitute only 6% of mtb isolates in pakistan  <cit> . despite the predominance of cas <dig> in south asia, there is limited data related to its transmission and drug resistance  <cit> . spoligotyping while instrumental in identifying mtb genogroups is unable to help discriminate amongst them. mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units variable number tandem repeat  is based on detection of independent mini satellite like loci scattered through out the mtb genome and has been shown to be a reliable and reproducible typing method with high discriminatory power  <cit>  for studying the mtb population structure in different countries  <cit> . the typed strains are expressed by a 12-digit numerical code, corresponding to the number of repeats at each locus  <cit> . this numerical code is easy to compare and exchange at inter-, and intra-laboratory level. the discriminatory power of miru-vntr analysis is proportional to the number of loci evaluated. in general, the discriminatory power of standard twelve loci based typing only slightly lower than that of the is <dig> based restriction fragment length polymorphism , which is currently the gold standard for mtb genotyping  <cit> .

twelve loci based miru-vntr analysis has been used in a number of molecular epidemiologic studies and to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship of clinical isolates  <cit> . it has also been used to study beijing strains from east and south asia  <cit> . available data for miru-vntr typing for mtb in pakistan is limited to one report wherein five exact tandem repeat  were used to type  <dig> mtb isolates from rawalpindi, pakistan. this showed clustering of one third of the isolates, which were further discriminated by an is <dig> based analysis  <cit> .

in this study we have used standard  <dig> miru-vntr loci typing to identify the alleles most discriminatory for cas <dig> as compared with 'unique' spoligotypes within mtb strains selected from different geographical location in pakistan. we have also determined the association of these strains with mdr.

RESULTS
miru typing for the predominant cas <dig> genogroup and 'unique' strains from pakistan
the twelve loci miru-vntr analysis detected a total of  <dig> miru patterns in our sample size of  <dig> strains . the  <dig> strains of the cas <dig> genogroup were found to be more than  <dig> % homologous, but were further divided into  <dig> distinct patterns comprising of;  <dig> clusters of two strains each,  <dig> cluster of four strains and with  <dig> non-matching patterns. the  <dig> strains previously identified by spoligotyping as 'unique'  <cit>  remained unclustered after miru analysis. the distribution of the miru alleles is summarized in table  <dig> 

discriminatory index:#≥ <dig>  = highly discriminant and * <dig> – <dig>  = moderately discriminant

allelic diversity
allelic diversity of clinical isolates was determined by twelve miru loci analysis using the hunter gaston discriminatory index . overall, miru-vntr typing of  <dig> mtb strains indicated a discriminatory power of  <dig> . diversity of cas <dig>  and 'unique'  strains was further calculated separately . allelic analysis of  <dig> cas <dig> strains showed a hgdi of  <dig> .

significantly different loci are indicated by '*' 

allelic diversity for each locus was calculated in order to determine the discriminatory power of these loci in a combined group for the mtb population studied. overall, the average allelic diversity of loci studied in these strains was found to be  <dig>  . based on their discriminatory index , seven miru loci  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were designated as "highly discriminant" . while, miru loci  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were designated as "moderately discriminant"   <cit> . in our mtb population locus  <dig> was found to be the most discriminatory allele in order to distinguish between cas <dig> strains and 'unique' spoligotypes. locus  <dig> provided a  <dig> allelic discrimination with a hgdi of  <dig> . this was followed by loci  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively in order of decreasing discrimination. locus  <dig> was found to be the least discriminatory with  <dig> alleles and a hgdi of  <dig> .

as shown in table  <dig>  the average allelic diversity of cas <dig> strains was found to be  <dig> . of these, seven miru loci, numbers  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  were "highly discriminant" ; four miru loci,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were "moderately discriminant" ; while locus number  <dig> was "poorly discriminant"  for cas <dig> isolates.

the average allelic diversity of 'unique' strains was found to be  <dig>  . the diversity patterns observed for 'unique' strains was similar that found for cas <dig> strains, i.e. eight miru loci, number  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were "highly discriminant"  and four loci numbers  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were "moderately discriminant" . however, no loci for 'unique' strains were identified to be "poorly discriminant".

discriminatory power of miru-vntr typing for cas1
further statistical analysis was carried out to investigate the utility of each of the twelve loci of miru typing to distinguish between cas <dig> and 'unique' strains. data was analyzed using the non-parametric mann-whitney test. results revealed that differences in loci  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were statistically significant .

is6110-rflp typing
to further investigate the heterogeneous pattern shown by miru-vntr typing, is6110-rflp typing was carried on a subset of strains;  <dig> cas <dig> and  <dig> 'unique' spoligotypes. is6110-rflp typing of these  <dig> strains resulted in  <dig> different rflp types . one cluster of two strains, with single copy of is <dig> was identified, which was further discriminated into individual patterns by miru-vntr typing. the remaining seventy two strains revealed unique rflp patterns while four strains were of 'zero' copy is <dig>  despite the heterogeneous fingerprint pattern shown by rflp based clustering, the  <dig> cas <dig> strains with multiple is <dig> copy exhibited 60% homology. about one fourth of the strains tested had  <dig> copies of is <dig> element.

comparison of mdr isolates
we analyzed miru patterns for all the mdr strains in order to investigate an association between resistance and mirus. of the cas <dig> strains studied,  <dig> were mdr  while  <dig> 'unique' strains were mdr . hgdi values of miru loci in mdr strains are shown in table  <dig>  locus  <dig> was found to be statistically significant in discriminating between cas <dig> and 'unique' mdr strains. overall, no significant difference could be established between miru patterns of cas <dig> and 'unique' mdr isolates.

*locus  <dig> between the two is significantly different 

discussion
we have used miru-vntr typing to characterize the predominant cas <dig> genogroup of mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in pakistan. limited information is available about the utility of miru-vntr typing method to characterize cas <dig> strains i.e. 2– <dig>  <cit> . this study presents the largest miru-vntr genotyping data for pakistani isolates to date. using  <dig> loci based miru-vntr typing we studied a population of  <dig> mtb strains and found them to be highly diverse. of the  <dig> cas <dig> strains studied only  <dig>  clustered into groups based on miru profiles, while all  <dig> 'unique' spoligotypes studied had non-matching miru profiles and therefore remained unclustered.

twelve loci based miru-vntr typing has been extensively used to study beijing strains. results of these studies indicates beijing strains to display variable clustering, between 53–100%  <cit> . amongst the beijing isolates, locus  <dig> has been found to be the most discriminatory followed by locus  <dig> and  <dig>  while other loci being almost monomorphic  <cit> . in contrast, using  <dig> loci based miru-vntr analysis we were unable to identify any monomorphic loci within the cas <dig> genogroup. our data showed miru loci  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in decreasing order, to be the most discriminatory for the cas <dig> genogroup of mycobacterium tuberculosis. despite exhibiting genetic phylogenetic variability cas <dig> strains studied also revealed more than 70% homology in their miru profile. this could either be due to an intrinsic similarity within the cas <dig> genogroup or may be reflective of relatedness between strains found in a particular geographical region.

the overall allelic diversity and discriminatory power of the vntr loci in the mtb isolates of cas <dig> and ' unique' spoligotypes studied from pakistan were higher than that reported earlier for strains from singapore, russia and south africa  <cit> . the greater diversity observed can be attributed to continual import of new strains due to traffic of people between pakistan and neighboring countries endemic for tuberculosis such as, migration of populations from afghanistan, and also travel between neighboring countries including china, iran, the middle east, india and bangladesh. it could however also be due to the presence of hyper variable regions in the strains circulating in this region. previous studies have suggested that increased strain diversity may also be due to lower transmissibility of indigenous strains  <cit> .

to further understand the genetic character of mtb strains studied, we subjected a subgroup of cas <dig> and 'unique' spoligotypes to is6110-rflp typing. of the  <dig> cas <dig> strains studied,  <dig> revealed a variable multi-copy is6110-rflp profile while two strains had zero copy of is <dig> element present. this is the first report of a zero copy is <dig> mtb strain as previously cas <dig> strains have been shown to have multiple copies of is <dig>  <cit> . one cluster of two strains detected by rflp typing containing one copy of is <dig> was further differentiated by miru-vntr typing, further supporting the higher discriminatory ability of miru-vntr typing especially for low copy is <dig> strains  <cit> .

miru-vntr allelic studies have been correlated with definitions of ancestral and modern mtb lineages, with the presence of one allele in locus  <dig> being related to a modern strain type  <cit> . we found that 62%  of our cas <dig> strains contained only one allele at locus  <dig>  further confirming their modern lineage. this is comparable with previous reports for cas <dig> and beijing strains from singapore and bangladesh  <cit>  and also from india as supported by the absence of the tbd <dig> region from their cas family strains  <cit> .

we also compared our miru profiles of the cas <dig> family isolates with studies from russia, singapore and bangladesh  <cit> , through an international database  and also with cas strains from india  <cit> . however, none of the cas <dig> miru types we identified were shared by those reported previously. this implies that our cas <dig> genotypes are generally clonal and corroborates previous work which has suggested this strain family to be a highly diverse genetic group.

we have used the standard  <dig> loci based method of miru-vntr typing. however, recent studies have identified increasing numbers of related miru loci which may help in further discrimination between strains. supply et al. used  <dig> loci based typing and subsequently recommended  <dig> loci based typing for phylogentic analysis and  <dig> loci typing for improved epidemiological studies  <cit> . they identified mirus  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as being highly discriminatory  for routine epidemiological studies  <cit> . on the other hand gutierrez et al used  <dig> loci based vntr typing to study  <dig> mtb isolates from india  <cit> .

the  <dig> standard loci analysis we used included all six miru loci recommended by supply et al  <cit>  and also  <dig> of the  <dig> loci used by gutierrez et al  <cit> . while using larger number of loci would certainly be more discriminatory for lineage analysis, our analysis focused more on differentiation within cas <dig> strains. as such an overall comparison of miru loci for cas <dig> and 'unique' strains revealed loci  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> to be in descending order of discrimination for allelic diversity. loci  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had a significantly lower discriminatory index with a p-value <  <dig>  in cas <dig> strains than in 'unique', suggesting these loci to be the most conserved in cas <dig> strains. in addition, locus  <dig> of cas <dig> mdr strains also had significantly lower discriminatory index with a p-value <  <dig>  when compared with mdr 'unique' spoligotype strains. although, cas <dig> strains constituted 53% of the total mdr strains, overall, no significant association of cas <dig> family could be established with multidrug resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
the effectiveness of miru loci to discriminate between strains may vary between populations. therefore, it is important to determine the most discriminatory alleles for each country depending on the preponderance of mtb strain types. in a region where cas <dig> family of strains are the most prevalent spoligotype we found miru loci  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in decreasing order, to be the most discriminatory for differentiation of mycobacterium tuberculosis.
