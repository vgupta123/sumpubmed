BACKGROUND
cellular senescence is irreversible exit from the cell cycle resulting from the limited replicative capacity  <cit>  caused by telomere shortening  <cit> , dna damage, and the epigenetic derepression of several genes such as the ikk4a/arf locus  <cit> . senescence and aging are complex processes with multiple causal mechanisms  <cit> . recently, due to increase of understanding for the senescence mechanism, it was shown to be a heterogeneous phenotype driven by multiple casual mechanisms instead of a singular state  <cit> . to understand senescence, an analytical approach based on systems biology is needed to reveal the interactions among several multiple effector programs of the senescence phenotype  <cit> . genome-wide profiling of molecular-level changes during senescence such as changes in gene expression is particularly important.

a recent study analyzed genome-wide gene expression at various time points during the establishment of replicative senescence and revealed senescence stage-specific gene perturbations  <cit> . analysis of the functional enrichment for each stage indicated initial perturbation of cell cycle-related genes and subsequent perturbation of metabolic, inflammatory, and immune-related genes at the middle stage. at the final stage, genes related to cell death and cell growth regulation were perturbed. thus, genome-wide time-series analysis can reveal the genotypic signature underlying senescence.

time-series gene expression data have been widely used to explore the molecular-level events during a phase change such as the senescence process described above, despite of difficulty of culturing cells to full senescence. typical analytical methods use co-expression patterns to identify functional modules or compare pairwise time points to capture features of the transition or to identify temporally regulated gene expression versus one control sample  <cit> . consequently, these approaches yield results based on individual genes or gene sets without considering the connectivity between them. however, cellular processes involve the interactions among several molecules, and these processes can be represented as a biological network with genes or proteins as nodes and their relationships as edges. thus, interactome data of biophysically interacting proteins are especially useful for analyzing biological processes, but few attempts have been made to integrate time-series gene expression and protein-protein interaction  data, particularly in senescence and aging.

recently, a study reported the construction of an age-specific integrative gene network with ppi and topological analysis of the network to reveal the key modules in aging  <cit> . to construct a network, differentially expressed age-specific genes were selected by following methodology of  <cit> , which had used criterion as follows;  <dig> -fold change,  <dig>  fdr. the protein interactions mapped with the selected genes become edges of the network. as a result,  <dig> age-specific networks were obtained and ‘ground truth’ gene set collected by analyzing brain gene expression data was used to demonstrate whether the networks were significantly related with the aging process or not. the authors revealed that the global topology of the age-specific networks was similar to each other, whereas the local topologies of several genes were significantly different. for the topological comparison among age-specific networks, the similarity measure called graphlet degree distribution agreement  <cit>  was used. it was revealed that the local topologies were significantly changed with age and those genes were associated with age.

we proposed a novel approach to investigate the core modules of a genetic network highly correlated with phenotypic changes from time-series data. to construct the network, we integrated a perturbed gene set with biophysically validated ppis recently published  <cit>  and identified and analyzed the core sub-gene network. based on the evidence that continuously perturbed interactions can be used to interpret a gradual phenotypic change with abrupt changes at the beginning and end points, we hypothesized that a sub-gene network with a constant topological structure but gradually altered context  plays an important role in phenotypic change. this concept can be applied to study cellular senescence because several senescence-related functions, such as the cell cycle, are not enriched at the abrupt phase; actually, a previous study revealed that cell cycle remodeling was nearly continuous during senescence  <cit> . the proposed approach is distinguished from the previous senescence studies. the previously mentioned study  <cit>  did not consider the interactions among the perturbed genes during senescence and  <cit>  analyzed the network modules topologically changed during aging.

to test our hypothesis, we applied the proposed method to two replicative senescence datasets from human diploid fibroblasts  and mesenchymal stem cells  and one independent cancer progression dataset from human tissue neoplasia. we performed functional enrichment of the identified core sub-gene network and simple significance tests to confirm whether our findings reflect changes in gene expression that account for the observed phenotypic change.

methods
data description and system overview
as a proof of concept for our approach, we intensively used recently published time-series gene expression data  measured during replicative senescence in hdfs  <cit> . this time-series microarray data  was composed of twelve sequential order of senescence stages according to the population doubling time including young and old phenotypes as the first and last time points, respectively. the senescence phenotype for each stage was identified and confirmed by typical determinants such as increased or decreased reactive oxygen species  levels and high or low level of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. we also used time-series microarray data  collected during replicative senescence in mscs  <cit> . these data included nine passages from young to old status. finally, we employed time-series microarray data  for elucidating epithelial cancer progression  <cit> . this dataset included four time points and was selected to test whether the proposed approach was applicable to processes besides senescence. the series matrix files of these microarray based data were downloaded and if there was no obvious description about normalization process in geo, the normalization was performed. the array platform of these three datasets was different each other. gse <dig>  gse <dig> and gse <dig> used illumina humanht-12 v <dig>  expression beadchip, illumina humanht-12 v <dig>  expression beadchip and affymetrix human genome u <dig> plus  <dig>  array, respectively.

to identify the connectivity between genes, we downloaded a recently published human ppi dataset  <cit>  with  <dig>  high-confidence ppis compiled from systematic screening with high-throughput yeast two-hybrid and literature studies and validated using biological assays. although the high-confidence ppi set is smaller than the typical ppi set from the i2d database , biological validation allows greater confidence in conclusions based on these ppis. the proteins in these ppis were mapped into gene symbols using uniprot  <cit> .

the entire workflow of the proposed method is shown in fig.  <dig>  as described above, time-series gene expression dataset and ppis are integrated and the structurally conserved network is identified. using this network, phenotypic changes during senescence and cancer progression are analyzed.fig.  <dig> overall workflow of the proposed method. for each time point, interactions including perturbed genes are identified from protein-protein interactions, and networks are constructed. the common network across time points is identified and it is validated by performing computational and functional significance tests




identification of time-specific networks
before identifying the perturbed gene set, we carry out quantile normalization for the time-series gene expression dataset with r. for normalization of the downloaded dataset which is series matrix format in geo, we used ‘preprocesscore’ library provided by bioconductor. by normalization, we can expect that the average of expression values and relatively highly expressed genes at certain time points were adjusted. this gives a similar intensity distribution for each time point. after normalization, perturbed gene sets were identified to construct a network for each time point. in our method, the perturbation score of a gene at a time point is calculated as follows: pgeneij=eij−1m∑k=1mei,k where gene
ij indicates gene i at time point j, e
ij indicates the expression value of the i
th gene at the j
th time point, and m is the total number of time points. this formula measures the difference between each expression value and the average for expression value. the perturbation score, p, is calculated for every gene at every time point, and larger values implied that gene i was relatively perturbed at time point j. if adjacent time points with similar phenotypes are grouped, the average perturbation score for the grouped time points was used.

only genes with perturbation scores above the threshold  are selected for each grouped time point. the threshold as determined for a given dataset by assuming the perturbation scores are normally distributed and setting the threshold as the sum of the mean and standard deviation. figure  <dig> depicts a detailed toy example of the entire analytical flow to identify perturbed genes. first, the average expression values are calculated for five genes. then perturbation score for each gene at each time point is calculated. for example, the perturbation score of the third gene at time-point  <dig> is  = − <dig> . final perturbation scores of the third gene at merged time-point  <dig>   <dig> are calculated as follows; if time point  <dig> and  <dig> can be grouped, the average perturbation score is− <dig>  calculated by / <dig>  then this score is compared with upper and lower threshold values . in this example, the final perturbation score is  <dig> because the average perturbation score is more than lower threshold and less than upper threshold. if the final perturbation score of the gene is not zero, this gene can be included in the perturbed gene set for each time point. to construct a time point-specific network, we identify a set of interactions including at least one perturbed gene from the high-confidence ppi dataset. from these selected interactions for each time-point, time-specific networks are built.fig.  <dig> identification of temporally perturbed genes. in the time-series microarray, each expression value is converted into a perturbation score. after establishing a threshold value from these perturbed scores, filtered perturbed scores satisfying thresholding condition are employed to select interactions




identification and analysis of common network
from the identified time-specific networks which have different size and include different interactions, we detect topologically conserved sub-network across time-point. as described in the introduction, we assumed that sub-networks with constant topological structures play important roles in phenotype change. topological conservation for a sub-network refers to its continuous perturbation with changing phenotype. as mentioned in the introduction, we assumed that these network modules and the transition of their information such as perturbation scores were related to phenotypic changes. to prove our assumption, we calculate the average difference of perturbation scores between two time points after identification of common network. for example, in fig.  <dig>  if gene  <dig> and gene  <dig> are selected as a member of common network, the average difference of perturbation scores between time-point1and <dig> and time-point <dig> will be  <dig>  which is calculated by | + |- <dig> – <dig> |)/ <dig>  from this calculation, we can determine whether the variation of perturbation scores and the state of phenotypic changes are associated or not. to investigate that perturbation scores were related to phenotypic changes, the statistical tests for all possible pairs of adjacent time points and one additional pair composed of the first and the last time points was performed.

statistical support for significance of common network
we investigate an association between phenotypic changes and variation of perturbation scores with statistical test based on large-sized random sampling. we assume ‘average differences of perturbation scores from our common network and random network are same’ as a null hypothesis. we tested whether this hypothesis can be rejected or not. the test is composed of three steps. as shown in fig.  <dig>  first, all interactions identified by the proposed method are collected. from this collection, the interactions are randomly chosen as numerous as the proposed method selected. for example, if  <dig> interactions were identified by the proposed method at time point  <dig>  the same-sized  <dig> interactions are randomly selected from the collection about this time point. consequentially, the random selection only permutes order of time point. secondly, across time point, common network is detected from randomly selected interaction set. lastly, we calculate the average difference of perturbation scores between two time points with this common network. these three steps are repeated  <dig>  times to generate the distribution. we calculate p-value which indicates whether we can reject the hypothesis or not. through the result of this test, we demonstrate that context transition explainable phenotypic change can be observed in the conserved network reflecting a time order, i.e. identified by the proposed method. this procedure was systematically implemented by using java and r.fig.  <dig> workflow of computational validation. as many as the number of interactions for each time point identified by the proposed method, interactions are randomly selected without considering their time points to construct random networks. from these random networks, a common network is identified. at two time points which can explain phenotypic change, the average difference of perturbation scores is calculated on common network. this random sampling process is repeated as many as  <dig>  iterations. based on the distribution from  <dig>  average differences of perturbation scores, the statistical significance of our average difference of perturbation score is performed using statistical test




RESULTS
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we applied it to three time-series gene expression datasets: two senescence datasets and a cancer progression dataset. although we focused on senescence, we included the cancer progression dataset to test the applicability of our method to other types of datasets. we detected a common network from whole time point-specific networks and demonstrated how the common network can explain the phenotypic change for the three experimental datasets by performing statistical tests and functional enrichment with kegg pathway database and gene ontology database.

to determine a optimal thresholds for identifying perturbed genes, we used dataset-specific cut-off values. as described in method section, we calculated the mean and standard deviation for the perturbation scores in given dataset and found that the perturbation scores were not normally distributed: the mean was near zero, and the standard deviation was relatively small. however, we assumed that the distribution was gaussian because the number of perturbation scores was large enough to apply the central limit theorem. supporting fig.  <dig> shows the distribution about perturbation scores. we used μ ± 1σ as a threshold: perturbation scores above μ + 1σ or below μ–1σ were chosen to construct each network. the number of genes selected by using μ ± 2σ or μ ± 3σ as a threshold was too small to construct networks. the experimental results while changing the cut-off threshold were shown in supporting table  <dig> and  <dig> of the additional file.

with the common network, we investigated a statistical significance comparing all possible adjacent stages. as shown in table  <dig>  among three possible adjacent comparisons, only the second comparison  was significant. from this result, we could suggest that phenotypic change between middle and advanced stages was relatively more influential than other transitions. actually, it was reported in the previous study  <cit>  that the results of functional analysis in early and middle stage were similar each other. these two stages were highly related with cell cycle and metabolic process. similary, the results of functional analysis in advanced and very advanced stage were similar. previous study  <cit>  reported these two stages were related with cell death and nfkb cascade functions. in addition, we performed the significant test for comparison between early and very advanced stage, which indicate the first and last, respectively. the p-value was almost zero for this comparison. the phenotypic changes between the first and last stage was understandably obvious since young cell turned into old cell. this result demonstrated that context transition of the conserved network can reflect and explain the phenotypic changes. surpporting fig.  <dig> shows the four distributions of average difference of perturbation scores from random samplings for each comparison. in additon, we carried out multiple comparison tests with final perturbation scores of the selected genes for each time-point using anova and tukeyhsd method in r. in this experiments, we identified that the early and very advanced time point was most significantly different. supporting table  <dig> shows this results.table  <dig> the result of statistical significance test to compare perturbation scores between two time points on senescence dataset

we performed statistical test with a significance level of  <dig> . in two  among three adjacent comparisons, the difference of perturbation score was not significant. however the difference of perturbation score at the comparison between early and very advanced time points was strongly significant




we investigated how perturbation scores of the common network are changed during transition and whether this changes have direction to the increase or decrease. as shown in fig.  <dig>  we could find two representative patterns from changing profile of perturbation scores. up and down fluctuation of these two patterns were almost opposed, mutually. we observed that relatively up-regulated genes in early stage were gradually decreased along with going to very advanced stage. on the contrary, relatively down-regulated genes in early stage were gradually increased along with senescence.fig.  <dig> profile on change of perturbation scores of the member genes in the identified common network . a change of perturbation scores during senescence process. there were two striking patterns, one of which is gradually decreased pattern and the other is gradually increased pattern. b comparison for changes of perturbation scores in adjacent two time points and the first and the last time point. we could identify that the changing pattern was reversed at both the first and the last time point. as a statistical result shown in table  <dig>  this reversely changed pattern of expression is rarely happen. therefore, we could assume that the common network included information to explain the senescence process




furthermore, we applied the proposed method to the cancer progression dataset   <cit>  and performed same experiments as mentioned above. table  <dig> shows a summary of the identified networks for each stage. the network size was different at each stage, and the proportion of selected interactions was less than  <dig> % in general; the common network comprised only ~ <dig> % of all used interactions. figure  <dig> shows the identified common network. we investigated a statistical significance from all possible neighboring stages including a comparison between the first and last stage. as shown in table  <dig>  statistical test was also performed, we revealed that only one comparison between day <dig> and day  <dig> was not signficant.table  <dig> network information for cancer progression dataset

to capture the progression of invasive neoplasia, the author made an ras-inducible human model which can be changed epidermal tissue to squamous cell carcinoma  <cit> . in this experiments, hyperplasia and disordered tissue polarity were observed that between day  <dig> and day  <dig>  and fully manifest invasive phenotype was culminated by day  <dig> to  <dig>  therefore, until day  <dig>  phenotype was rapidly changed and after day  <dig>  the fully changed phenotype was observed. owing to this phenotypic change, the average difference of perturbation scores between day  <dig> and  <dig> was not significant compared to random case. we demonstrated that the common network constructed by our approach reflects this phenotypic changes. the p-value of comparision between the first and last day was  <dig> e– <dig>  which is considerably significant. as shown in fig.  <dig>  we also observed that the profile of perturbation scores in the common network could support the result of significant test.fig.  <dig> profile on change of perturbation scores of the member genes in the identified common network . a change of perturbation scores during cancer progression process. there were two striking patterns, they are gradually increased. b comparison for changes of perturbation scores in adjacent two time points and the first and the last time point




functional enrichment in hdf senescence and cancer progression dataset
through abovc experiments, we computationally analyzed common network in time-dependent gene expression profile. in addition to the computational validation, we performed two types of functional enrichment test on the common network. fisrt, we performed gene ontology based enrichment using bingo  <cit>  plugin in cytoscape  <cit> . secondly, we carried out pathway enrichment test using kegg database. because the identified common network had small size and simple topology, we used the entire common network as an input of functional enrichment test.

on hdf senescence dataset, top  <dig> pathways and gene ontology terms  were listed in table  <dig>  as expected, among several pathways, cell cycle and cancer related pathway were significantly enriched. in gene ontolgies, response to several stimulus, cell proliferation and development related processes were importantly enriched. these processes were regarded as an important roles in senescence. on cancer progression dataset, we also selected top ten enriched pathways and gene ontology terms. the result was described in table  <dig>  in kegg pathways, bladder cancer pathway was enriched. in gene ontologies, cancer progression associated term was enriched such as anatomical structure development.table  <dig> on the common network from hdf senescence dataset, the list of top  <dig> terms of functional enrichment test with kegg pathway and gene ontology database.

identification of regulatory module from common network
time point-specific gene networks can be more important than the common network in most analyses. however, our approach aids in elucidating temporal changes in biological functions. thus, our approach is appropriate for investigation of continuously affected molecular effectors such a cell cycle in replicative senescence. to demonstrate this hypothesis, we performed additional experiments and described the result herein.

we attempted to trace temporal changes in the pattern of perturbation scores for the cell cycle specific common network. to identify this common network from hdf senescence dataset, we only used and focused on  <dig> known cell cycle-related genes which are annotated in the gene ontology database. we identified a common network comprising  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges as shown in fig.  <dig>  among the  <dig> cell cycle-related genes, only  <dig> continuously affected senescence while maintaining a constant topology and displaying gradual and directional changes in perturbation score values. during aging, we identified genes known to be up- and down-regulated  during senescence with similar regulations in our analysis. for example, kif <dig>  a cell cycle controller, was down-regulated in senescence status by activation of p <dig> via the rb/e2f pathway  <cit> ; crabp <dig> was strongly down-regulated with increased passage number in human amniotic fluid-derived stem cells and might act as a negative regulator to limit cellular senescence  <cit> ; and ccnd <dig>  another well-known cell cycle regulator, is down-regulated in hdf senescence  <cit> .fig.  <dig> visualized dynamic change of the perturbation scores in the identified common network limited to cell cycle-related genes




as has been demonstrated by several previous studies , variation of the perturbation score values in the identified common network was generally consistent with expectations for cellular senescence. interestingly, the gene expressions at the young and senescence stage were completely opposed. based on this result, we propose that the identified common network can switch cell cycle activity between young and senescence status. alternatively, transcription factors  that regulate genes in the identified common network could act as the switch.

in this study, we focused on the former assumption because there may be regulatory relationships among genes of the network. we attempted to identify the regulatory relationships for the identified common network using pathwaystudio  <dig>  software  to build a pathway of directed interactions among genes in common network , omitting six orphan genes. we included two types of regulation: protmodification and directregulation. protmodification indicates a regulator that modifies the target molecule through phosphorylation, glycosylation, etc., and directregulation indicates direct physical interactions that can influence target activity.fig.  <dig> inferred regulatory relationship and perturbation score changes according to the senescence process. a regulatory pathway of the identified cell cycle-specific common network constructed using pathwaystudio. b transition of the expression level reflecting the regulatory relationship among member genes in 




interestingly, we observed a feedback loop composed of the replicative senescence related genes: cdk <dig>  ccnd <dig>  cdkn1a, and cdkn1b . in the observed regulatory network, including the feedback loop, cdk <dig> was the most important node because it acted as a hub and could be the genesis of the loop. it has been known that cdk <dig> regulates dna replication in g <dig> and reported to switch cell cycle status from g <dig> phase to s phase  <cit> . furthermore, high expression of cdk <dig> can form a transcription complex and induce the expression of tumor suppressor p <dig>  <cit> . it has been reported that p <dig> is significantly related with molecular mechanism of senescence  <cit> .

in our feedback loop , the subunit regulators of cdk <dig>  were down-regulated in young status; thus, these four proteins were simultaneously down-regulated in young status. however, expression of cdk <dig> was increased upon senescence. along with this expression alteration of cdk <dig>  cdk <dig> could inhibit cdkn1b by negatively regulating its phosphorylation. cdkn1b translation is also reduced during g <dig> arrest  <cit> , and cdkn1b down-regulation could inhibit ccnd <dig>  which is also positively influenced by cdkn1a. thus, cdk <dig> may be consistently up-regulated by ccnd <dig> during senescence, allowing maintenance of full senescence status. much of this process has been previously reported , but our method allowed identification of the regulatory relationship among them with a more integrated view, and we note that our approach yielded a result reflecting the senescence process.

in addition, we investigated tfs which can control this regulatory relationship. we used recently published computational method, iregulon  <cit> . among the results which have high enrichment score , we selected tfs inferred by transfac database widely used to search tfs. then, we filtered tfs targeting on cdk <dig>  as a result, we can identified seven tfs; stat5a, arid3a, pou4f <dig>  dlx <dig>  znf <dig>  lmx1a, pax <dig>  among them, stat5a and arid3a have been revealed to be related with cell cycle process  <cit> . pax <dig> has been reported to be mechanistically associated cancer cell proliferation  <cit> . through this result, it is possible that the identified regulatory relationship and the related tfs can be regarded as strong candidate which controls cell cycle phase replicative senescence.

discussion
we analyzed whether the expression levels of four genes constructing above feedback loop are corresponding to the regulatory loop or not using an independent dataset. we used recently published gene expression profile on the replicative senescence in normal human diploid fibroblasts  <cit> . in this dataset, young and old status was defined as being less than  <dig> population doublings and more than  <dig> population doublings, respectively. the relative gene expression level was measured by comparing young and old status. through analysis of this profile, as shown in fig.  <dig>  we observed that expression pattern of the independent dataset follows the changing relation of the identified regulatory feedback loop according to senescence. based on the analysis, we carefully expected that the identified regulatory module can be a part of cell cycle modulation, if we limited to hdf cell. we are planning to apply our method to tissue level gene expression profile in order to identify a module controlling aging process.fig.  <dig> relative gene expression profile and fold change values about four genes that compose the identified feedback loop. cdk <dig>  ccnd <dig> and cdkn1a were up-regulated in old status. on the other hand, cdkn1b was down-regulated in old status. this expression pattern was corresponding to the transition pattern for gene expression of the regulatory feedback loop during senescence




CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we proposed a novel approach to identify gene networks that are significantly correlated with phenotypic changes from time-series data. in this process, we integrated a recently published ppi dataset with time-series gene expression data to produce informative interactions among genes. networks were validated with statistical tests and functional enrichment. to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed method, we used three different real datasets for cellular senescence and cancer progression. the identified networks were appropriate to explain the phenotypic changes. in our future work, we plan to carry out perturbing experiments with the identified tfs to demonstrate whether they can contribute to changing phenotype by affecting expression level of cdk <dig> and its looping member or not.
