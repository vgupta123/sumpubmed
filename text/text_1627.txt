BACKGROUND
high density lipoprotein cholesterol  levels in human plasma correlate generally with protection against coronary heart disease, an effect believed to be due to multiple protective actions of hdl including stimulating the removal of excess cholesterol from cells and reducing inflammation in the artery wall  <cit> . the initial formation of hdl particles requires the membrane lipid transporter atp-binding cassette transporter a <dig>  to mediate delivery of cellular lipids to hdl apolipoproteins. this reduces excess cholesterol stores in cells including arterial wall macrophages  <cit> . in addition to receiving cellular lipids, lipid-free apolipoprotein a-i  binds to and inhibits the degradation of abca <dig>  further enhancing the formation of hdl particles  <cit> . lipidated apoa-i on the surface of discoidal or spherical hdl particles, however, has a reduced affinity for abca <dig> and does not inhibit abca <dig> degradation  <cit> . these findings suggest structural motifs present in lipid-free but not lipid-bound apoa-i participate in abca <dig> binding and enhancement of abca <dig> cell surface stability.

in addition to increasing abca <dig> expression transcriptionally, therapies that increase abca <dig> cell surface stability represent a potential means to increase hdl production. we previously showed that oxidation of hdl ex vivo with peroxidase-generated tyrosyl radical  increases the ability of hdl to deplete the regulatory pool of intracellular cholesterol  <cit> , increase cholesterol available for subsequent efflux to apoa-i and other lipid acceptors  <cit> , and reduce the development of atherosclerosis in apoe-deficient mice  <cit> . enhanced depletion of intracellular cholesterol was seen only when tyrhdl apoproteins and specifically the apoai-apoaii heterodimer in tyrhdl were bound to the surface of spherical hdl particles, but not in their lipid-free form. this suggests a particular conformation of tyrhdl apos when lipid-bound mediates the enhanced effect  <cit> . in the current study we tested the hypothesis that tyrhdl has these beneficial effects by enhancing abca <dig> activity, either by increasing abca <dig> expression or cell surface stability. our results indicate that, like lipid-free apoai, tyrhdl has no effect on abca <dig> mrna levels, but increases total and cell surface abca <dig>  reduces calpain-dependent and -independent degradation of abca <dig>  and can be crosslinked directly to abca <dig>  also like lipid-free apoa-i but not hdl apos, apos on the surface of tyrhdl are more susceptible to enteropeptidase digestion. these results suggest that tyrosyl radical oxidation induces changes in apolipoprotein conformation on the surface of spherical hdl that allows lipid-bound tyrhdl apos to interact with abca <dig> like lipid-free apoa-i.

RESULTS
tyrhdl requires abca <dig> to deplete cholesterol available for esterification
lipid-free apoa-i depletes the regulatory pool of cholesterol available for esterification by acyl-coa:cholesterol acyltransferase  much more readily than hdl  <cit> , due to mobilization of this cholesterol pool by abca <dig> and delivery to apoa-i  <cit> . tyrhdl mobilizes acat-accessible cholesterol much more readily than hdl, an effect that was not found to be due to direct inhibition of acat or stimulation of cholesteryl ester hydrolysis  <cit> . to investigate the role of functional abca <dig> in this activity, hdl and tyrhdl were incubated with cholesterol-loaded fibroblasts from control and two unrelated patients with tangier disease, and the subsequent production of cholesteryloleate quantified. as reported previously  <cit> , tyrhdl showed a markedly increased ability to deplete acat-accessible cholesterol from normal fibroblasts in comparison to control hdl . tyrhdl did not have an enhanced ability to mobilize acat-accessible cholesterol compared to hdl from tangier disease fibroblasts, and depletion of this pool was reduced to similar levels by both forms of hdl in comparison to normal cells . this suggests tyrhdl requires abca <dig> for its enhanced cholesterol-mobilizing effect.

tyrhdl increases abca <dig> protein but not mrna levels
to test whether tyrhdl has an effect on abca <dig> transcription, cholesterol-loaded fibroblasts were incubated with either fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin  alone or with the addition of  <dig> μg/ml apoa-i, hdl, or tyrhdl for  <dig> h or  <dig> h prior to determination of abca <dig> mrna level by real-time pcr. at  <dig> h, abca <dig> mrna level was reduced similarly by all treatments when compared to cholesterol-loaded cells at  <dig> h . following a  <dig> h incubation, abca <dig> mrna remained elevated in cells treated with bsa alone, but was reduced similarly to low levels by apoai, hdl, and tyrhdl, consistent with depletion of cellular cholesterol regulating abca <dig> expression by all of these treatments. these results are consistent with previous results showing no effect of apoa-i on abca <dig> mrna level  <cit> , and suggest no differential effect of tyrhdl on abca <dig> transcription when compared to apoa-i or hdl.

apoa-i has previously been shown to increase abca <dig> protein levels in cultured cells and in the liver of apoa-i-injected mice  <cit> . consistent with these findings, total cell homogenates obtained from cholesterol-loaded fibroblasts incubated for  <dig> h with  <dig> μg/ml apoa-i exhibited higher levels of abca <dig> protein than cells treated with albumin alone or similar levels of hdl . cells treated with  <dig> μg/ml tyrhdl showed increased levels of abca <dig> protein when compared to apoa-i, hdl or bsa treatments at both  <dig> and  <dig> h. these results suggest tyrhdl has an enhanced ability to stabilize abca <dig> protein post-translationally when compared to apoa-i and control hdl.

tyrhdl protects abca <dig> from calpain-dependent and -independent proteolysis
calpain-dependent proteolysis of abca <dig> is mediated through a proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine-rich  sequence  <cit> , and is inhibited by lipid-free apoa-i but not hdl  <cit> . to determine whether tyrhdl inhibits calpain-dependent proteolysis of abca <dig>  cholesterol-loaded fibroblasts were incubated with bsa alone or plus apoa-i, hdl or tyrhdl for  <dig> or  <dig> h, followed by treatment with  <dig>  μm μ-calpain for  <dig> min  <cit> . abca <dig> protein degradation by μ-calpain was observed in bsa and hdl treated fibroblasts at both time points, with a 50-60% reduction in abca <dig> protein when compared to the absence of μ-calpain . no appreciable degradation of abca <dig> by calpain was observed in apoa-i- or tyrhdl-treated cells at either time point .

lipid-free apoa-i also increases abca <dig> protein levels by interfering with calpain-independent proteolysis of abca <dig>  <cit> . increased abca <dig> protein seen in the presence of the calpain inhibitor alln and bsa alone at  <dig> h was increased further by apoa-i, and most markedly by incubation with tyrhdl . these results indicate tyrhdl inhibits calpain-dependent and -independent proteolysis of abca <dig> to a level similar or greater than lipid-free apoa-i.

tyrhdl increases cell surface abca <dig> like lipid-free apoa-i
apoa-i-dependent reduction of abca <dig> proteolysis results in increased cell surface as well as total cellular abca <dig>  <cit> . to determine the effect of tyrhdl on cell surface abca <dig>  cells incubated with either bsa alone or with addition of  <dig> μg/ml apoa-i, hdl, or tyrhdl for  <dig> h were then biotinylated to label cell surface proteins. total and biotinylated cell surface abca <dig> were isolated and probed for abca <dig>  erk , and β-actin proteins by immunoblot. increased cell surface abca <dig> was seen with both apoa-i and tyrhdl treatment, paralleling the increase in total cellular abca <dig>  and to a greater extent than seen with hdl treatment .

tyrhdl forms crosslinks with abca <dig> similar to lipid-free apoa-i
several studies using the chemical cross-linker dithiobis propionate  have suggested apoa-i can directly bind to abca <dig>  whereas hdl does not  <cit> . these findings indicate conformational features present in lipid-free but not lipid-bound apoa-i allow the lipid-free form to bind to abca <dig>  to determine whether tyrhdl might also bind to abca <dig> like lipid-free apoa-i, cholesterol-loaded fibroblasts were treated with lxr agonist t <dig> to upregulate cell surface abca <dig> protein expression, and then incubated with either bsa alone or with addition of apoa-i, hdl, or tyrhdl for  <dig> h, followed by incubation with dsp for an additional hour, and separation of whole cell homogenates for immunoblotting as described  <cit> . apoa-i colocalized with a band corresponding to abca <dig> under non-reducing conditions . in the presence of the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol, free apoa-i was observed at its expected molecular weight of  <dig> kda. like apoa-i, when tyrhdl was dsp crosslinked, a prominent anti-apoa-i antibody reactive band colocalized with abca <dig> under non-reducing conditions, and was released in the presence of reducing agent to a ladder of lower molecular weight apoa-i-containing bands. in contrast to control hdl, which showed very minimal binding to abca <dig>  these results suggest conformational changes are present in lipid-bound tyrhdl apolipoproteins that allow them to bind to abca <dig> like lipid-free apoa-i.

tyrhdl undergoes enteropeptidase digestion similar to lipid-free apoa-i
to investigate the possibility that lipid-bound apos on tyrhdl can assume a lipid-free conformation, the susceptibility of tyrhdl to enteropeptidase digestion was compared to unmodified hdl and apoa-i. enteropeptidase cleaves lipid-free apoa-i at arg <dig> to form a major fragment of about  <dig> kda, but has no ability to cleave lipid bound apoa-i present either on reconstituted or native hdl . enteropeptidase treatment of lipid-free apoa-i converted a majority of the protein to a lower molecular weight fragment , while hdl was resistant to proteolysis . exposure of tyrhdl to enteropeptidase resulted in loss of the majority of a  <dig> kda band consistent with an apoa-i-a-ii monomer heterodimer, both on coomassie blue-stained sds page gel and by immunoblotting with anti-apoai and anti-apoaii. this apoa-i-apoa-ii heterodimer has been identified as the protein element of tyrhdl that is responsible for enhanced cholesterol efflux when compared to hdl  <cit> . nearly all of the apoa-i in this heterodimer on tyrhdl was digested, whereas the apoaii component was only partially digested, possibly due to apoaii multimers also running at this molecular weight. the apoai monomer band of tyrhdl was also mainly digested, to fragments smaller than  <dig> kda, suggesting apoai in tyrhdl is susceptible to enteropeptidase but produces different fragments than native apoai . these results suggest that unlike lipid-bound proteins on the surface of native hdl, the lipid-bound apoai-aii heterodimer, and also tyrosylated apoai, on the surface of tyrhdl are able to assume at least partial lipid-free conformations, making them susceptible to enteropeptidase digestion.

discussion
the current study provides several lines of evidence that oxidation of hdl by peroxidase-generated tyrosyl radical induces conformational changes in lipid-bound hdl apolipoproteins that allows them to interact with abca <dig> like lipid-free apoa-i. incubation of abca1-expressing human fibroblasts with tyrhdl increases total cellular and cell surface abca <dig> and inhibits calpain-dependent and -independent proteolysis of abca <dig>  as also mediated by lipid-free apoa-i but not hdl  <cit> . additionally, tyrhdl can be crosslinked to abca <dig> and is susceptible to proteolysis by enteropeptidase like lipid-free apoa-i. these findings, therefore, represent the first demonstration of apoproteins on the surface of spherical hdl particles behaving like lipid-free apoai and capable of interacting with and stabilizing abca <dig> against proteolysis although lipid-bound. the tyrhdl-induced increase in abca <dig> protein is consistent with our previously observed ability of tyrhdl to markedly deplete acat-accessible cholesterol  <cit> , increase cholesterol available for removal by apoa-i  <cit> , and to reduce atherosclerosis development in apoe-deficient mice  <cit>  in comparison to native hdl.

apoproteins on the surface of spherical tyrhdl increase abca <dig> protein level and activity
our findings indicate that tyrhdl increases cholesterol mobilization from cells by interacting directly with abca <dig> and enhancing abca <dig> protein stability. like lipid-free apoa-i, no effect was seen by tyrhdl on abca <dig> mrna levels. consistent with this, previous studies demonstrated the lipid extract of tyrhdl had no ability to enhance cholesterol mobilization from cells when reconstituted with control hdl apoproteins, suggesting oxysterols present in tyrhdl lipids were not driving abca <dig> expression at a transcriptional level  <cit> . those studies also found the lipid-free protein fraction of tyrhdl had a similar but slightly lower ability to deplete acat-accessible cholesterol than equivalent concentrations of lipid-free proteins from native hdl  <cit> . tyrhdl proteins reconstituted into discoidal hdl showed a modestly increased ability to deplete this cholesterol pool in comparison to discoidal rhdl made with native hdl proteins. only when tyrhdl proteins were reconstituted onto the surface of spherical hdl was the full differential activity of tyrhdl compared to native hdl observed  <cit> . these results suggest the enhanced activity of tyrhdl versus native hdl is most clearly seen when tyrhdl proteins are bound to a spherical rather than a discoidal hdl surface. they also suggest that it is the particular conformation of tyrhdl apoproteins when present on the surface of spherical hdl, and not tyrhdl apos that dissociate off the particle surface, that are responsible for this effect.

apoproteins on the surface of tyrhdl appear to assume a partially lipid-free conformation
the combined results suggest hdl apoproteins oxidized by tyrosyl radical and specifically the apoai-aii heterodimer created by this oxidation binds to the surface of the lipoprotein differently than apoproteins on hdl, and that the modifications induced by tyrosyl radical oxidation produce a partially lipid-free conformation in lipid-bound apoa-i. we propose a possible model wherein the more lipophilic apoa-ii component of the apoai-aii heterodimers on tyrhdl  <cit>  tethers apoa-i to the hdl particle surface, allowing apoa-i to be attached to hdl while it also assumes a partially lipid-free conformation. this conformation would facilitate binding of the tethered apoa <dig> to abca <dig>  and inhibition of abca <dig> degradation. as a result, exposure of cells to tyrhdl causes abca <dig> to be retained on the cell surface and protected from calpain-dependent  as well as calpain-independent  proteolysis. the increased abca <dig> protein level leads to the enhanced mobilization of excess intracellular cholesterol that would otherwise be esterified, and makes this cholesterol available for efflux to apoa-i and new hdl particle generation.

the nature of the conformation of tyrhdl apoai-aii heterodimers on the surface of tyrhdl requires further investigation. particular regions of apoa-i thought to be critical to the apoa-i-abca <dig> interaction have been suggested but not yet confirmed  <cit> . the similarities in binding to and stabilization of abca <dig> between lipid-bound tyrhdl apos and lipid-free apoa-i suggests tyrhdl represents a useful tool to investigate the nature of this apoprotein-abca <dig> interaction critical to the formation of new hdl particles.

whether or not peroxidase-generated tyrosyl radical oxidation of hdl represents a significant mechanism of hdl oxidation in vivo is an unanswered question, and is not the purpose of these studies. myeloperoxidase is known to generate tyrosyl radical as one of its oxidizing products in addition to hypochlorous acid  <cit> , and ldl containing products of tyrosyl radical oxidation have been isolated from human atherosclerotic plaques  <cit> . the relative importance of tyrosyl radical oxidation of hdl in vivo, which ex vivo appears to enhance abca <dig> activity, as compared to other oxidative modifications of hdl and apoa-i that impair abca1-dependent cholesterol efflux  <cit> , remains to be determined. regardless, the ability of tyrhdl generated ex vivo to enhance abca <dig> activity represents an important model for the development of peptide therapies that retain this ability when in the lipid-bound form. since nearly all hdl apoproteins are lipid-bound in vivo, this signifies a major difference from apoa-i, which only shows abca1-enhancing activity when lipid-free.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here provide the first demonstration of lipid-bound hdl apolipoproteins capable of enhancing abca <dig> protein level and activity like lipid-free apoa-i, and an explanation for the previously identified salutary effects of tyrhdl.
