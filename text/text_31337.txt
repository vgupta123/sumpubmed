BACKGROUND
the bi- or multinuclear reed-sternberg cells , the diagnostic cells of hodgkin's lymphoma , are derived from their mononuclear precursors, the hodgkin cells  through endoreplication and have a limited capacity to divide further  <cit> . rs-cells appear to be true end-stage tumour cells and their number of nuclei correlates closely with the 3d organization of telomeres  <cit> . using a recently developed three-dimensional quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization technique for telomere   <cit>  we showed in vitro and in diagnostic biopsies that further nuclear division becomes likely impossible because of sustained telomere shortening, loss, aggregation and formation of telomere- and dna-poor "ghost" nuclei  <cit> . this process is identified in both, classical ebv-negative and ebv-positive hl  <cit> .

the recently established hodgkin cell line u-ho <dig>  derived from a patient with primary refractory hl of nodular sclerosis subtype, is ebv negative, expresses cd <dig> together with cd <dig> and has a clonal non-functional vdj-heavy gene rearrangement . u-ho <dig> expresses a truncated and non functional form of the non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase ptpn <dig>  has a doubling time of about  <dig> days under standard culture conditions and forms about 4% of typical rs-cells in suspension  <cit> . stable expression of ptpn <dig> in u-ho <dig>  results in very slow proliferation, substantially increased  rs-cell formation and higher levels of apoptosis  <cit> .

ptpn <dig>  specifically deactivates phosphorylated stat5a and stat5b  <cit>  which regulates self-renewal capacity and differentiation of memory b-cells  <cit> . phosphorylated stat5a is highly expressed in all hl-cell lines analyzed so far  <cit> , and its expression is essential for morphogenesis of rs-cells  <cit> . ptpn1-/- mice show accumulation of large b-cells in bone marrow and lymph nodes  <cit>  as well as increased development of inflammatory macrophages  <cit> . moreover, double knock out p53-/- ptpn1-/- mice rapidly develop b-cell lymphomas  <cit> . these findings are consistent with a significant influence of ptpn <dig> in b-cell lymphomagenesis on an inflammatory background as present in hl  <cit> .

in order to analyze the 3d nuclear telomere dynamics associated with the transition from h- to rs-cells and to clarify the functional role of ptpn <dig> expression in this process, we analyzed by 3d telomere q-fish both, mononuclear h-cells and multinuclear rs-cells of the u-ho <dig> and the u-ho1-ptpn <dig> cell lines, respectively.

RESULTS
growth characteristics
the hl cell lines u-ho <dig> had a doubling time of about 3- <dig> days, and u-ho1-mock about  <dig> days, whereas u-ho1-ptpn <dig> grew much slower with a doubling time of about  <dig> days. in steady state culture, the number of at least bi-nucleated rs-cells was about 4%-5% in both, u-ho <dig> and u-ho1-mock, but significantly higher  in u-ho1-ptpn <dig> . both cell lines, u-ho <dig> and u-ho1-ptpn <dig> had equally high telomerase activity and in u-ho1-ptpn <dig> stable expression of the specific protein-tyrosin-phosphatase was confirmed by western blotting . stable expression of ptpn <dig> was associated with a high apoptosis rate and had a significant impact on presence of phosphorylated stat <dig>  which was high in u-ho <dig> but nearly absent in u-ho1-ptpn <dig> .

3d nuclear organization of telomeres in hodgkin cells of u-ho <dig> and u-ho1-ptpn1
mononuclear h-cells of u-ho <dig> and u-ho1-ptpn <dig> showed largely identical 3d telomere characteristics . the only difference was a small increase  of very short telomeres including so-called "t-stumps" , occurring in u-ho <dig> h-cells .

3d nuclear organization of telomeres in reed-sternberg cells of u-ho <dig> and u-ho1-ptpn1
reed-sternberg cells of both, u-ho <dig> and u-ho1-ptpn <dig>  showed several common characteristics as previously identified in rs-cells of the hl cell lines hdlm- <dig>  l- <dig>  l- <dig> and patient biopsies  <cit> . as expected, u-ho1-rs-cells and u-ho1-ptpn <dig> rs-cells significantly differed from their mononuclear h-cell precursors by their nuclear volume , number of telomeres  and increase of telomere aggregates . strikingly, rs-cells of u-ho <dig> differed from u-ho1-ptpn1-rs cells by a highly significant increase in very short telomeres including so-called "t-stumps"  . rs-cells of u-ho <dig> often showed numerous very short and short telomeres without loss of mid-sized telomeres and stable number of telomeres/ <dig> μm <dig> of nuclear volume, consistent with the hypothesis that these rs-cells were still able to divide further through endoreplication, resulting in giant rs-cells . indeed, such telomere rich u-ho1-rs cells were regularly identified and telomere-poor or -free "ghost" nuclei were rare. contrary to the u-ho <dig> rs-cells, the ptpn <dig> expressing rs-cells did not show any increase of very short telomeres  resulting in multinuclear rs-cells with a low number of telomeres/ <dig> μm <dig> of nuclear volume when compared to their mononuclear h-precursors . in such u-ho1-ptpn <dig> expressing rs-cells formation of telomere-poor "ghost" nuclei was frequently observed.

discussion
the q-fish analysis of the 3d nuclear telomere organization in the hl cell line u-ho <dig> reveals analogous characteristics of multinuclear rs-cells compared to their mononuclear precursor h-cells as recently described in the hd-cell lines hdlm- <dig>  l- <dig>  l- <dig> and in diagnostic biopsies of ebv-negative and lmp1-expressing classical hl  <cit> . rs-cells of u-ho <dig> have a 3- <dig> times higher nuclear volume, a highly significant increase of telomere aggregates, and a substantial increase of very short telomeres, including so-called "t-stumps", a hallmark of cancer cells  <cit> .

but contrary to the rs-cells of hdlm- <dig>  l- <dig> and l- <dig>  which show a significant loss of telomeres/ <dig> μm <dig> of nuclear volume compared to their mononuclear precursor h-cells, the rs-cells of u-ho <dig> show still the same number of telomeres/ <dig> μm <dig> of nuclear volume as their mononuclear h-cell precursors, consistent not only with a high telomerase activity but also with a still functioning shelterin complex allowing correct telomere elongation  <cit> . indeed, u-ho <dig> is far less genetically aberrant than other hl cell lines  <cit>  but has about a six-fold copy number gain of rel and a strong corresponding nuclear c-rel protein localization, indicating a high nuclear nf-κb transcriptional activity  <cit>  which is required for proliferation and survival of h- and rs-cells  <cit> . phosphorylated stat <dig>  whose expression and activation is controlled by nf-κb, and which is also required for hl lymphomagenesis  <cit> , is identified in the cytoplasm of h- and rs-cells in u-ho <dig> .

we hypothesize that the telomere dynamics identified in u-ho <dig> reflect accumulation of phosphorylated stat <dig> resulting in permanent akt/pkb  activation, for the following reasons: i) in hl accumulation of phosphorylated stat <dig> in h- and rs-is frequent and possibly due to the expression of a mutated, non functional socs- <dig> gene  since single cell analysis of microdissected h- and rs-cells from patient biopsies showed a significant correlation between high nuclear phosphorylated stat <dig> expression and socs- <dig> gene mutations  <cit> , ii) cytoplasmic accumulation of phosphorylated stat <dig> is identified in chronic and acute myeloid leukemias and constitutive stat <dig> activation promotes leukemogenesis through cytoplasmic complex formation with pi3-k/gab <dig> resulting in akt/pkb activation  <cit> , iii) activation of akt/pkb is needed for g2/m transition and may override a g <dig> arrest induced by dna damage  <cit> . this abrogation of the mitotic spindle cell-cycle checkpoint leads indeed to polyploidization in vascular smooth muscle cells transfected with akt <dig>  <cit>  and might explain why some rs-cells of u-ho <dig> progress to >8n dna content through endoreplication while still conserving a stable number of telomeres/ <dig> μm <dig> 

ptpn <dig> may exert tumor suppressing or tumor promoting effects depending on the substrate involved and the cellular context  <cit> . in the context of u-ho <dig>  stable expression of ptpn <dig> in the same cell line had highly significant effects on slowing down the proliferation, on induction of apoptosis, and on increasing the formation of rs-cells. these rs-cells had a significant loss of the number of telomeres/ <dig> μm <dig> of nuclear volume but no increase in the number of very short telomeres including "t-stumps" compared to the mononuclear h-precursors. thus, stable ptpn <dig> expression was associated with dissociation of the reported 3d telomere dynamics during rs-cell formation, resulting in numerous rs-cells with a precursor h-cell 3d telomere profile .

since ptpn <dig> specifically deactivates phosphorylated stat5a and stat5b  <cit>  and stable expression of sirna targeting stat <dig> slows down the proliferation of l- <dig> and l- <dig> cells by 200-300%  <cit> , we hypothesize ptpn <dig> induced dephosphorylation of stat <dig> in u-ho1-ptpn <dig> cells to be the mechanism slowing down the proliferation. in particular, the consecutive lack of pi3-k/gab <dig> and akt/pkb activation needed for g2/m transition might alleviate anti-apoptotic potential, result in a g <dig> arrest induced by dna damage  <cit>  and accumulation of end-stage rs-cells. the lack of any increase of very short telomeres in u-ho1-ptpn <dig> rs-cells, contrary to the significant increase marking the transition from h- to rs-cells in hdlm- <dig>  l- <dig>  u-ho <dig> and, most importantly, in patient biopsies, is consistent with the induction of apoptosis by ptpn <dig> expression since induction of apoptosis does not change the abundance of "t-stumps" in cancer cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our q-fish analysis of the 3d telomere dynamics in the hl cell lines u-ho <dig> and u-ho1-ptpn <dig> reveals that stable ptpn <dig> expression is associated with i) low proliferation rate, ii) increased number of rs-cells, iii) induction of apoptosis, and iv) prevention of the additional formation of very short telomeres and "t-stumps", but not interfering with other 3d telomere dynamics associated with rs-cell formation. whether ptpn <dig> induced dephosphorylation of cytoplasmic stat <dig> is at the origin of these profound changes has to be addressed by further experimental studies.
