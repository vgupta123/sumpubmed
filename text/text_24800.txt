BACKGROUND
rna polymerase holoenzyme, consisting of a 5-subunit core rna polymerase  and a dissociable subunit, sigma , initiates bacterial transcription. the σ factor contains many of the promoter recognition determinants and several σ factors each recognizing their specific class of promoter sequences have been described  <cit> . in general, in exponentially growing bacteria transcription is initiated by rna polymerase carrying the housekeeping σ, known as σ <dig>  <cit> . alternative σ factors mediate transcription of regulons activated under specific environmental conditions  <cit> . the activity of many alternative σs is inhibited by a specific anti-σ factor. in a wide variety of bacterial species the σ factor σe,, also known as extracytoplasmic factor or ecf, belonging to the group iv σs, is essential in mounting responses to environmental challenges such as oxidative stress, heat shock, and misfolding of membrane proteins  <cit> . in addition, σe is of importance for virulence of bacterial pathogens  <cit> . the regulon size of σe varies widely among bacterial species studied, ranging from  <dig> unique σe controlled transcription units in e. coli and related bacteria  <cit>  to a relatively small regulon of  <dig> genes in neisseria gonorrhoeae  <cit> . in most examples, the gene encoding σe  is located in an autoregulated operon that also contains, directly downstream of rpoe, the gene encoding its cognate anti-σe factor  <cit> . extensive sequence analysis showed that about one third  of known and predicted anti-group iv σ factors, encoded in a gene cluster with a group iv σ , contain a conserved structural n-terminal fold, recently described as the anti-sigma domain   <cit> . typically, the asd is in the n-terminus, oriented towards the cytoplasm, preceding a c-terminal transmembrane segment. however, 20% of the  <dig> asd containing proteins are not predicted to contain a transmembrane spanning c-terminal domain  <cit> . among these, 95%  are characterized by the presence of an invariant hisx3cysx2cys sequence motif important for anti-sigma activity, co-ordinating zn2+, described as the zinc containing anti-σ factor  group iv anti-σs proteins  <cit> . asd proteins and asd proteins containing the zas motif are predicted to bind specifically to σs and inhibit their activities  <cit> .

the strictly human pathogen neisseria meningitidis colonizes the nasopharynx of approximately  <dig> to 30% of the population. in rare instances colonization results in invasive disease leading to life-threatening septicemia and meningitis  <cit> . meningococci possess a variety of genes involved in adaptation to specific changes in the environment encountered in the host  <cit> . in addition to nutrient limitation, meningococci are also exposed to massive amounts of reactive oxygen species produced by host defenses  <cit> . fine tuning expression of genes required to survive hostile growth conditions is a prerequisite for the meningococcus to establish disease.

all four publicly available, completely sequenced genomes of n. meningitidis contain a gene  encoding a protein with homology to σe, the σ factor involved in stress responses  <cit> . in this study we explored the σe regulon of n. meningitidis. in addition, we provide evidence that the expression of σe  in meningococci is autoregulated and that its activity is under control of a protein encoded directly downstream of rpoe. this protein, encoded by nmb <dig>  is structurally related to asd proteins and contains the zas motif . we demonstrate that the cys residues in the zas motif, as well as a cys on position  <dig>  are important  or essential  for anti-σe activity of nmb <dig> 

RESULTS
the gene cluster containing rpoe is transcribed as a polycistronic operon and transcriptionally regulated by σe
in many bacterial species, rpoe is part of an autoregulated polycistronic operon also encoding its cognate anti-sigma factor  <cit> . in meningococci, nmb <dig> is annotated as rpoe, encoding a protein with a molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda, 98% identical to the σe orthologue of n. gonorrhoeae  <cit>  and 28% identical to σe of e. coli. meningococcal rpoe is part of a ˜ <dig> kb cluster of genes nmb <dig> through nmb <dig>  having a genomic arrangement similar to that found in n. gonorrhoeae  <cit> . all genes, except nmb <dig>  are annotated as hypothetical proteins. the minimal spacing found in the cluster suggests co-transcription of its genes.

to investigate whether the genes found in the gene cluster nmb <dig> through nmb <dig> are co-transcribed and under transcriptional control of σe, a meningococcal strain in which expression of rpoe can be controlled, was generated by transformation of h44/ <dig> with the shuttle vector pen <dig> carrying rpoe under control of an iptg-inducible promoter, creating h44/ <dig> + pnmb <dig>  transcript levels of the gene cluster were analysed by rt-pcr using rna isolated from these cells grown in the absence and presence of iptg and primer pairs as depicted in fig. 1a. with either wt cells  or h44/ <dig> + pnmb <dig> cells grown in the absence of iptg, hardly any detectable rt-pcr products of co-transcripts were found . only the small  <dig> nt product  could be seen . in contrast, only when h44/ <dig> + pnmb <dig> cells were grown in the presence of iptg, specific rt-pcr products, with sizes corresponding to calculated sizes  and  <dig> nt  containing the predicted sequences of nmb2140-nmb <dig>  were detected, while the  <dig> nt product was strongly induced . these observations indicate that the gene cluster containing rpoe is transcribed as a polycistronic operon and transcriptionally regulated by σe. the fact that complete transcripts of the rpoe operon were only found upon overexpression of rpoe suggests that in h44/ <dig> wt cells, under the growth conditions tested, the levels of  σe allow only barely detectable transcription.

identification of proteins under control of σe
to further explore the meningococcal σe regulon, protein patterns of the h44/ <dig> wt strain, Δrpoe and h44/76˜pnmb <dig> were compared by sds-page. no apparent protein expression level differences between h44/ <dig> wt and Δrpoe were observed in the proteomes of the cells . the addition of iptg to the culture medium of cells transformed with pnmb <dig> only gave minor changes in protein expression in the cytoplasm . in contrast, in the crude membrane fraction, a dramatic increase in the expression of a ˜ <dig> kda protein was observed . the increase in expression of this protein was iptg dependent as the protein was hardly detectable in crude membranes prepared from the same cells not exposed to iptg . peptide mass fingerprinting, using maldi-tof ms to analyze the tryptic fragments generated by in gel digestion, identified this protein as the methionine sulfoxide reductase msra/msrb, encoded by nmb <dig> .

msra/msrb is transcriptionally controlled by σe
to ascertain that msra/msrb is under direct control of σe, transcript levels of msra/msrb in diverse meningococcal genetic backgrounds were analyzed by rt-pcr using rna isolated from cells grown in the absence and presence of iptg and primers targeting msra/msrb. when h44/ <dig> wt or h44/ <dig> + pnmb <dig> cells were grown in the absence of iptg, no detectable rt-pcr products were observed. in contrast, when h44/ <dig> + pnmb <dig> cells were grown in the presence of iptg, an rt-pcr product with a size indicative of transcription of msra/msrb was found . the identity of the transcript was confirmed by sequencing of the rt-pcr product. these results strongly suggest that msra/msrb is transcriptionally controlled by σe.

nmb <dig> inhibits transcription of the rpoe regulon
one possible explanation for low σe activity in h44/ <dig> wt cells under the growth conditions tested is that σe is kept in an inactive state through an interaction with an anti-σ factor, thereby preventing σe binding to core rna polymerase, one of the ways to inhibit σ activity found in σ-regulator circuits in other bacteria  <cit> . interestingly, it was recently reported that nmb <dig> contains the zas motif hisx3cysx2cys  <cit> , characteristic for a subset of group iv σ anti-σ factors, usually encoded directly downstream of rpoe and cotranscribed  <cit> .

amino acid sequence comparison of orthologues of nmb <dig> in genomes of three other meningococcal strains, two gonococcal strains and six commensal neisserial species  revealed that the region containing the zas motif, as well as the region around cys <dig>  are highly conserved in these neisserial orthologues of nmb <dig>  this in contrast with other much less well conserved parts, highlighting the importance of the conserved regions . the relative positions of the cys residue and the zas motif in nmb <dig>  correspond exactly with those of the cys residue and the zas motif in rsra , the anti-σr factor of streptomyces coelicolor, of which the cys residues, but not his <dig>  are essential for anti-σ activity of the protein  <cit>  . these observations suggest that nmb <dig> codes for the meningococcal anti-σe factor.

to test this hypothesis we first investigated the effect of deletion or overexpression of nmb <dig> on transcript levels of the rpoe operon. to this end, a nmb <dig> deletion mutant  was constructed and complemented with nmb <dig> using pen <dig> carrying nmb <dig> under control of an iptg-inducible promoter . transcript levels of the rpoe operon were assessed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr using primers annealing to nmb <dig> and nmb <dig>  respectively.

as noticed before, rt-pcr products derived from the transcript encoding msra/msrb  and products indicative of co-transcription of nmb2140-nmb <dig>  were found only upon overexpression of rpoe in trans. however, deletion of nmb <dig> resulted in the direct detection of the nmb2140- <dig> without the need for overexpression of rpoe in the h44/ <dig> wt background. as expected, upon complementation of the Δnmb <dig> mutant by induction of expression of nm <dig> in trans, the nmb2140- <dig> rt-pcr product was no longer detectable. this effect was dependent upon induction of overexpression of nmb <dig> in Δnmb <dig> as it was not observed in the absence of iptg .

as one would predict, msra/msrb protein was detected in Δnmb <dig> and could not be detected anymore upon complementation of Δnmb <dig> by nmb <dig> when iptg was added to the culture medium . also, nmb <dig>  rt-pcr product was indeed detected in Δnmb <dig> cells but hardly in Δnmb <dig> cells when complemented by nmb <dig> .

together, these experiments demonstrate that nmb <dig> inhibits transcription of the rpoe regulon. conceivably, nmb <dig> binds to σe, thereby inactivating it, resulting in decreased transcription by means of autoregulation of the rpoe operon and, as a consequence of that, decreased transcription of msra/msrb.

the residues cys <dig>  cys <dig> and cys <dig> of nmb <dig> are essential for optimal anti-σe activity
to investigate whether the cys residues of the zas motif and the conserved cys at position  <dig> of nmb <dig>  in analogy to corresponding cys residues in rsra of s. coelicolor  <cit> , are also essential for anti-σe activity of nmb <dig>  we generated single ala substitutions at each of the cys residues and also of the single his residue of the zas motif  and at position  <dig> of nmb <dig>  the ability of these mutant nmb <dig> proteins to inhibit σe activity in meningococci was investigated by sds-page assessment of crude membranes, using mrsa/mrsb as reporter protein. all substitutions except his30ala resulted in expression of mrsa/mrsb . the substitution cys34ala resulted in msra/msrb levels comparable to those found in crude membranes prepared from Δnmb <dig> cells while the substitutions cys4ala and cys37ala resulted in more modest, but clearly detectable levels of msra/msrb . collectively, these experiments demonstrate that the cys residues of the zas motif, as well as cys <dig> of nmb <dig> are important for functionality of nmb <dig> as an anti-σe factor.

involvement of σe in the response to hydrogen peroxide, diamide and singlet oxygen
the cys <dig> and cys <dig> in nmb <dig>  essential in anti-σe activity, correspond exactly with cys <dig> and cys <dig> residues of rsra of s. coelicolor involved in disulphide bond formation. in addition, residue his <dig> in the zas motif of nmb <dig> is not required for anti-σe activity consistent with anti-σ properties of rsra  <cit>  and chrr, the zas containing anti-σe factor of rhodobacter sphaeroides  <cit> . in s. coelicolor, exposure to superoxide, hydrogen peroxide or the thiol specific oxidant diamide causes dissociation of the σr-rsra complex  <cit> . in contrast, chrr anti-σe activity is not affected by these reactive oxygen species, but responds to singlet oxygen   <cit> .

to investigate stimuli activating the σe response in meningococci, cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide, diamide or singlet oxygen and transcript levels of rpoe and msra/msrb were analysed by rt-pcr before and after exposure to these stress agents. no differences in transcript levels of either rpoe or msra/msrb were detected, suggesting that in meningococci σe is not involved in the response to such stimuli. in addition, no detectable differences in transcription levels of rpoe and msra/msrb were observed after exposure of cells to sds-edta, a stimulant known to induce membrane stress and activate rpoe in other bacterial species .

in silico genome wide search for additional genes under control of σe using a deduced neisserial σe promoter consensus sequence
each σ factor recognizes specific promoter sequences, characterized by relatively highly conserved - <dig> and - <dig> upstream dna sequences. using the promoter sequences of genes under the control of σe, a consensus sequence can be deduced. in several bacterial species, this motif has been successfully used for in silico genome searches to identify genes putatively controlled by σe. the σe dependent transcription of these genes can subsequently be confirmed by in vitro experiments  <cit> .

to further explore the meningococcal σe regulon, we used a similar strategy. however, in the meningococcus we were able to demonstrate transcriptional control by σe for only one operon  and one gene , so far. therefore, we extended the number of genes from which a σe promoter consensus sequence could be deduced with orthologues of nmb <dig> and nmb <dig> found in the sequences of  <dig> other meningococcal genomes,  <dig> gonococcal genomes and the genomes of  <dig> commensal neisserial species. in total, putative promoter sequences of  <dig> genes were used to generate a consensus promoter sequence by weblogo  <cit> . thus, the conserved putative - <dig>  and - <dig>  motifs could be identified . these motifs are separated by spacer of 12- <dig> nt . in addition, an at rich sequence was observed ˜ <dig> nt upstream of the - <dig> motif, corresponding to a consensus sequence designated the up element  <cit> . six nucleotides downstream of the - <dig> motif a highly conserved adenosine is found. this nucleotide and its position correspond exactly with the transcriptional start as experimentally identified for msra/msrb in gonococci  <cit> .

next, we used the - <dig> and - <dig> motif, allowing a spacer length of  <dig> to  <dig> nt to explore the genome of n. meningitidis mc <dig> to identify genes containing the rpoe promoter motif. besides nmb <dig> and nmb <dig>  no other genes were identified.

discussion
according to the annotation of the genome of n. meningitidis four genes are supposed to encode σ factors: rpod , rpoh , rpon  and rpoe   <cit> . to our knowledge, so far no information is available regarding the functionality of alternative σ factors in the meningococcus. here, we describe the first detailed investigation of the functionality of σe of n. meningitidis. in addition, we provide strong evidence that nmb <dig>  encodes a novel anti-σ factor structurally related to asd proteins and containing the zas motif, making nmb <dig> the first anti-σ-factor described for any neisserial species.

experimental evidence for transcriptional control by σe could be provided for only  <dig> genes, the  <dig> gene containing σe operon and msra/msrb. in line with this, genome wide in silico searches for genes with a σe promoter motif also did not result in additional genes putatively controlled by σe. this suggests a surprisingly small σe regulon in meningococci, as well as in gonococci  <cit>  as compared to that of other bacterial species as σe regulons can comprise up to  <dig> transcription units   <cit> .

although the consensus σe promoter recognition motifs of the - <dig> region of meningococci  and e. coli  are quite different, the last  <dig> residues of the - <dig> motifs of meningococci  and e. coli  differ in only one nucleotide  <cit> . in addition, other similarities between the structural elements of these promoter regions were observed, such as the at rich sequence ˜ <dig> nt upstream of the - <dig> motif. this sequence, designated the up-element, is a binding site for the c-terminal domain of the α-subunit of rna polymerase  <cit>  and has recently been shown to increase transcription of σe dependent promoters  <cit> .

recently, the first comprehensive analysis of conservation and variation of the σe regulon in e. coli and related organisms was reported  <cit> . the products of the core genes of the conserved σe regulon coordinate assembly and maintaince of lipopolysaccharide  and outer membrane proteins  of gram-negative bacteria, in response to cell envelope stress. the majority of the variable regulon members are functionally involved in pathogenesis  <cit> . of interest, it was also recently demonstrated that σe promoters in e. coli and its close relatives exhibit a large dynamic range, with a few strong and many weak promoters  <cit> . the three strongest promoters all carry out regulatory roles in the σe response, the strongest transcribing σe itself and its negative regulators, and the next two strongest transcribing small rnas  involved in downregulation of porin expression  <cit> . we did not observe expression differences of major outer membrane proteins upon overexpression of σe, making the involvement of σe in meningococci cell envelope stress uncertain. this was confirmed by our observation that membrane stress did not alter σe activity. however, as mentioned before, the majority of σe dependent proteins are expressed at low levels  <cit> , which might be below the detection limit of the assay used in this study. as it is much easier to detect small changes in the transcriptome comparing Δrpoe  or h44/ <dig> + pnmb <dig>  with h44/ <dig> , we are planning those experiments. the recent identification in n. meningitidis of an srna controlling a gene and functional hfq facilitating the interaction between srna and target mrna, suggests the existence of a ribo-regulated network in this pathogen  <cit> . in many other species links between the σe regulon and the ribo-regulated network exist  <cit> , but in meningococci this is as yet unexplored.

the genetic organization of the rpoe operon  of n. gonorrhoeae is identical to that of meningococci , and four genes, ngo <dig>  ngo <dig>  ngo <dig> belonging to the rpoe operon, and ngo <dig>  encoding msra/mrsb, were also upregulated, along with σe  itself, in a gonococcal strain overexpressing rpoe  <cit> . we demonstrated cotranscription of all genes in the meningococcal rpoe operon. the function of proteins encoded by nmb2140-nmb <dig> is currently unknown. nmb <dig> might encode a protein with possible trans membrane domains and contains motifs found in the doxx/d-like family, involved in oxidation of sulfur  <cit> . nmb <dig> through nmb <dig> encode hypothetical proteins of unknown function.

based on the structural relatedness of nmb <dig> to asd proteins  <cit>  and sequence conservation of cys residues shown to be essential for anti-σr activity of rsra of s. coelicolor  <cit>  we argue that nmb <dig>  directly downstream of and co-transcribed with rpoe, encodes the anti-σe factor. indeed, upon deletion of nmb <dig>  msra/msrb, which we demonstrated to be transcriptionally controlled by σe, was abundantly expressed. irrefutable evidence for a functional interaction of nmb <dig> with σe was obtained by the substitution of cys residues with ala at positions in nmb <dig> that correspond to cys residues in rsra. we found that cys <dig> of nmb <dig> is essential and, albeit to a lesser extent, cys <dig> and cys <dig> are also required for optimal anti-σe activity of nmb <dig>  we therefore suggest annotating nmb <dig> as mser, meningococcal sigmae regulator.

rsra is a metalloprotein, containing near-stoichiometric amounts of zn2+  <cit> . oxidation induces a disulphide bond between two of the zn2+ ligands  resulting in loss of zn2+ and dissociation of the σr-rsra-complex, thereby allowing σr transcription. thioredoxin is able to reduce oxidized rsra, and the induction of expression of thioredoxin itself is σr dependent, suggesting that σr, rsra and the thioredoxin system in s. coelicolor comprise a novel feedback homeostasis loop, sensing and responding to changes in the intracellular thiol-disulphide redox balance  <cit> . the cys <dig> and cys <dig> in nmb <dig>  of importance in anti-σe activity, correspond exactly with cys <dig> and cys <dig> residues of rsra involved in disulphide bond formation, suggesting that mser also contains zn2+. therefore, it was tempting to speculate that a similar thiol-disulphide redox balance also exists in meningococci. however, in n. meningitidis thioredoxin appears not to be upregulated upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide  <cit>  and we showed that transcription levels of msra/msrb are not affected after exposure of meningococci to hydrogen peroxide, diamide or singlet oxygen. whether nmb <dig> is also a zn+ containing protein, deserves further study.together, despite the structural resemblance between rsra and mser, these results show that mser functionally differs from rsra of s. coelicolor.

msra/mrsb, encoding methionine sulfoxide reductase, an enzyme repairing proteins exposed to reactive oxygen species  <cit> , is a major target of σe, and abundantly expressed when active σe levels are high. expression of msra/msrb is also controlled by σe in n. gonorrhoeae and caulobacter crescentus. interestingly, in n. gonorrhoeae msra/msrb is upregulated together with the genes ngo <dig> and ngo <dig> in response to hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . however, none of the meningococcal orthologues  <cit> , nor σe activity, as shown in our study, appear to respond to hydrogen peroxide,strongly indicating the existence of different modes of regulation of σe between gonococci and meningococci. in addition we did not found detectable differences in transcription levels of msra/msrb after exposure to sds-edta, a stimulant known to activate rpoe in other bacterial species. thus, in vivo stimuli activating the σe response in n. meningitidis are most likely different from those of gonococci and remain to be further explored.

CONCLUSIONS
the results show the existence of a σe regulon in meningococci. the product of nmb <dig>  functions as an anti-σe factor with properties different from membrane spanning anti-σe factors responding to signals in the periplasma. our data strongly indicate that mser, the meningococcal anti-σe factor, closely mimics structural properties of members of the zas family that are acting on novel stimuli encountered in the cytoplasm. stimuli of mser differ from those of the zas family anti-sigma factors suggesting that mser is a novel anti-σ factor. this could indicate a potentially important, specific role for σe in the pathogenesis of meningococcal disease.
