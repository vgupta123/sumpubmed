BACKGROUND
chromosomal microarray  analysis, which can better define the size of microdeletions/microduplications and their gene content, enables novel disease gene discoveries and genotype-phenotype correlation studies
 <cit> . the diagnostic yield of cma testing ranges from approximately 5% to 20% for patients with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , or multiple congenital anomalies , significantly higher than that of g-banded karyotyping 
 <cit> . the american college of medical genetics and genomics recommends the use of cma as thefirst-tier diagnostic test for these patients
 <cit> .

congenital heart defect  is among the most common birth defects and is a leading cause of infant mortality around the world. it affects approximately  <dig> -1% of newborns
 <cit> . recent studies have shown that pathogenic cnvs are identified in a substantial proportion of chd patients
 <cit> . multiple recurrent cnv loci such as 22q <dig>  , 7q <dig> , 8p <dig> , 9q <dig> , and 1q <dig>  were found to confer significant risk for syndromic or isolated chd
. these loci only explain a fraction of the genetic underpinnings of chd
 <cit> . in recent years, cma has been routinely offered to patients with chd. several studies have evaluated and reported the clinical diagnostic yields of such practice but largely based on small patient cohorts
. clinical diagnostic cma data have proven to be an invaluable source for genetic discoveries and genotype-phenotype correlation studies. here, we retrospectively reviewed the cnv detection in unselected clinical chd cases at the genetic diagnostic laboratory of boston children's hospital  and selected research chd cases from shanghai children’s medical center . we assessed the clinical significance of each cnv and evaluated the overall diagnostic yield. we further uncovered novel chd-associated cnvs and potential chd candidate genes through gene prioritization and pathway analysis.

methods
study subjects and phenotype classification
 <dig> patients  with at least one congenital heart defect who underwent clinical cma testing at bch between december  <dig> and april  <dig> were included in this study. the relevant medical records, including clinical notes and echocardiography reports, were reviewed. in addition,  <dig> chd patients  from scmc were included in this study. this group of patients was evaluated by echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, cardiac catheterization or surgical reports to determine the type of chd. scmc patients with gross chromosomal aberrations  were excluded from cma analysis. both studies were approved by respective irbs of boston children's hospital and shanghai children’s medical center. informed consent for patients from scmc was obtained from parents. no identifiable information was used in the manuscript. cases ascertained at bch included all chd phenotypes that were further subcategorized using the classification system established by national birth defects prevention study   <cit> , whereas cases ascertained at scmc primarily had conotruncal defects . patients who only had mild chd abnormalities  or were affected only by arrhythmia or cardiomyopathy were excluded from this study.

for comparison of cnv detection rate, a control cohort was assembled from previously published studies
 <cit> , which used high-density microarray platforms comparable to the ones used in this study.

chromosomal microarray testing and cnv evaluation
dna samples from all cases were extracted from peripheral blood with standard procedures. chd patients at bch were tested on the agilent 244 k comparative genomic hybridization  array platform or a 4 × 180 k snp + cgh microarray in a clinical diagnostic setting. cnvs were identified and evaluated as previously described
 <cit> .

chd cases at scmc were tested on the affymetrix cytoscan™ hd microarray platform in a research setting. data was visualized and analyzed by chromosome analysis suite  software package  with a minimal cutoff of  <dig> consecutive markers for cnv calling. all cnvs reported are based on ncbi human genome build  <dig> .

detected cnvs were evaluated through a filtering procedure and classified into five categories based on the acmg guideline
 <cit>  .

statistical analysis
two-sided fisher’s exact test was used to compare the frequencies of recurrent  cnvs between the case and the control cohorts, the cnv detection rates between isolated chd and syndromic chd, and the cnv burden for each subcategory of chd. a p value <  <dig>  was considered significant throughout this study.

gene prioritization for novel chd candidate gene identification
we developed an analytic process by integrating various tools and data sources to prioritize the genes involved in detected cnvs. refseq genes encompassed in the pathogenic cnvs and likely pathogenic cnvs were assembled as the starting gene list. the genes in deletions and duplications were analyzed separately . independently, we also used the same prioritization process to evaluate the novel chd candidate genes involved in the pathogenic cnv of each patient.

RESULTS
diagnostic yield of cma testing for patients with chd
among  <dig> chd patients from bch,  <dig> individuals were found to have gross chromosomal aberrations including five trisomy  <dig>  five monosomy x, one trisomy  <dig>  and one 18q partial trisomy. in the remaining patients, we detected  <dig> pathogenic cnvs in  <dig> patients  and  <dig> likely pathogenic cnvs in  <dig> patients  . the overall diagnostic yield of cma testing for patients with chd was  <dig> % when considering pathogenic, likely pathogenic cnvs and aneuploidies as positive finding. the minimal diagnostic yield was  <dig> % if only the cases with pathogenic genomic imbalances  were included. the majority of pathogenic cnvs  detected in patients were smaller than 10 mb in size, which would presumably be missed by karyotyping, again demonstrating the superior technical validity of microarray in detecting clinically relevant cnvs over karyotyping.

diagnostic yield of cma in syndromic vs. non-syndromic chd
all  <dig> patients carrying aneuploidy exhibited a syndromic chd phenotype. the remaining  <dig> individuals were divided into two groups: isolated chd or syndromic chd based on medical records. the former consisted of  <dig> patients and the latter consisted of  <dig> individuals exhibiting extracardiac phenotypes in addition to heart defects. the most common extracardiac phenotypes were id/dd, asd, behavioral features, hypotonia and craniofacial dysmorphism. even after excluding aneuploidy cases, there were significantly more non-polymorphic cnvs  in syndromic chd than in isolated chd . the p value for pathogenic cnvs only  and for pathogenic and likely pathogenic combined category  also reached statistical significance. based on this analysis, the diagnostic yield of cma for isolated chd was  <dig> % - <dig> % , whereas the diagnostic yield for all syndromic chd  is  <dig> - <dig> %  .table  <dig>

diagnostic yield of cma related to chd sub-types
we further compared the cnv detection rates between syndromic chd with co-occurring neurodevelopmental disorders  including dd, id and asd with those without ndd. twice as many pathogenic cnvs were detected in chd patients with ndd than those without ndd , indicating that patients with co-morbid features of chd and ndd were more likely to harbor pathogenic cnvs. this finding also suggested that cnvs detected in syndromic chd patients were not solely contributing to ndd which are known to be associated with cnvs.

to further delineate the association of chd sub-categories with cma detection rates, we classified the bch cases into nine categories . among patients with isolated chd, those with compound ctd , hypoplastic left heart syndrome  and obstruction of left ventricular outflow tract  were more likely to harbor pathogenic cnvs . when all chd cases were considered, patients with isolated ctd  exhibited the highest cma diagnostic rate . in addition, chd patients with compound ctd  and septal defects  also reached a >10% diagnostic rate. in contrast, chd patients with heterotaxy  or valve defects  were less likely to have a pathogenic cnv.table  <dig>

the cases of b category was too low, thus not included. the twelve patients with aneuploidy were not included for calculation.



among  <dig> scmc patients mainly affected with ctd, a total of  <dig> non-polymorphic cnvs were detected,  <dig> of them were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic . the cnv detection rate for this cohort was about 12%, which is similar to that of bch patients with the same sub-phenotype, thus we independently confirmed the significant involvement of cnv in ctd.

identification of known and novel recurrent cnvs associated with chd
a genome-wide cnv analysis for a total of  <dig> chd cases  led to the detection of  <dig>  non-polymorphic cnvs. as a result, a total of  <dig> cnvs at  <dig> unique chromosome loci were considered to be of known or possible clinical relevance in this study. they were widely distributed on different chromosomes . we observed  <dig> recurrent  cnvs distributed at six chromosomal loci  which include  <dig> imbalances  at 22q <dig>  and five aberrations  at the 8p <dig>  involving the gata <dig> gene, both loci are known to be associated with syndromic or isolated chd. in this study, we also identified five patients with 4q terminal deletions which range from  <dig>  600 kb to  <dig>  300 kb in size . similar deletions were not detected in  <dig> control cases , and are not reported in dgv . 4q terminal deletion is known to cause 4q- syndrome where 50% of affected individuals have chd, and a cardiovascular critical region has been narrowed down to 4q <dig> –q <dig> 
 <cit> . the smallest overlapping region  among our 4q terminal deletion cases was about  <dig>  mb in size at 4q <dig> -qter. this sor didn’t overlap with the previously defined critical region . thus our study potentially maps a novel chd critical region at the 4q terminus. there were  <dig> refseq genes at this interval, although no known chd genes existed, we propose several possible candidate genes in discussion.figure  <dig>

in addition, we identified three other genomic loci with significantly higher frequencies in cases than in controls. these three loci were 15q <dig>  , 16p <dig>   and yp <dig>    respectively, which were also considered as possible novel loci associated with cardiac development.

identification of novel chd candidate genes
among  <dig> cnv regions of interest, ten cnvs contained genes known to be causal for chd . in order to identify novel chd candidate genes, we examined the genes within the remaining  <dig> loci . starting from  <dig> genes in deletion cnvs and  <dig> genes in duplication cnvs , we performed a gene prioritization process using endeavour and toppgene.  <dig> genes in deletion cnvs and  <dig> genes  in duplication cnvs in the category of "cardiovascular system development and function" were identified as novel chd candidate genes through mouse embryonic expression pattern analysis and ingenuity pathway analysis  analysis .

furthermore, the same gene prioritization process was performed for individual cases carrying pathogenic cnvs of unknown chd significance. a total of  <dig> genes were identified in  <dig> cases . of note,  <dig> of these genes were also contained in the global prioritization list . these shared genes are considered to be the most likely dosage sensitive novel chd candidate genes.

discussion
diagnostic yields of cma testing
cma has been recommended as the first-line test in the initial postnatal genetic evaluation of individuals with mcas, dd/id and asd
 <cit> . chd is known to be frequently associated with cnvs . currently, patients with chd are routinely offered cma testing. in contrast to previous publications , the present study documents the diagnostic yields for several sub-categories of syndromic and non-syndromic chd using the largest cohort.table  <dig> 
summary of the diagnostic yields of cma in clinical setting with different microarray platforms in studies of chd from literatures


260b
diagnostic yield was defined as the number of patients with abnormal aberrations divided by the total number of cases tested. in patients with syndromic chd, pathogenic chromosomal imbalances were detected in about 16%-25% of cases. but the diagnostic yield of cma in isolated chd cohort was poorly studied.


amany cnvs included were not necessary pathogenic.


btwelve patients with gross chromosomal aberrations were included.



previous clinical studies have demonstrated a higher cnv diagnostic yield in syndromic chd than that in isolated chd, but these studies were all done separately for either syndromic chd or isolated chd by different array platforms . using the largest cohort of chd from one clinical setting, we were able to assess the cma diagnostic yields for both syndromic and isolated chd patients by the same cma platform. our study convincingly demonstrated a significantly higher cnv detection rate in syndromic chd  than isolated chd .

importantly, our data also revealed that the cnv diagnostic yields differ among different chd subcategories, indicating different chd sub-phenotypes may have different pathogenic mechanisms. the findings that isolated ctd, compound ctd, and septal defects were more likely to be associated with cnvs than heterotaxy or valve defects provided practical guideline for referring chd patients for cma testing. however, the number of cases in each sub-category was still small in this study. research involving a larger sample size is warranted to further delineate the correlation between cnv rate and chd sub-phenotypes.

in the clinical setting, the pathogenicity of a cnv is assessed based on gene content, cnv size, and literatures. in many instances, the causal relationship between a particular cnv and a particular phenotype cannot be easily established. it is likely that not all of the pathogenic cnvs detected are directly causative of chd. thus, the exact diagnostic yield of causal cnvs for chd may be less than the overall pathogenic cnv detection rate . we identified  <dig> cnvs with known chd genes . in addition, we also detected  <dig> aneuploidies that are known to be causally associated with chd phenotypes. therefore, a total of  <dig> cases out of  <dig>  have chromosomal imbalances that are known to cause chd. additionally, we believe that a significant fraction of the remaining cnvs currently with unproven causal relationship with chd may turn out to be novel chd loci .thus, although the exact diagnostic yield of causative cnvs is difficult to assess, it is reasonable to believe that the actual diagnostic yields is higher than  <dig> %, and somewhat smaller than  <dig> %. this level of diagnostic yield is similar to that for asd 
 <cit> , dd/id or mcas 
 <cit> . thus our findings provide strong evidence for cma to be used as the first-line genetic diagnostic test for patients with chd as well.

many chd patients in our study exhibited comorbid features of dd, mcas or asd, which are known to have a significant association with cnv. the fact that syndromic chd patients have a higher pathogenic cnv detection rate than cases with only dd/id/asd suggests that not all cnvs detected in our syndromic chd patients can be attributed to the dd/id or asd phenotype. our data demonstrated an additive effect on cnv burden when these phenotypes co-occur with chd. the fact that patients with isolated chd exhibited a cnv diagnostic rate of  <dig> % further supports the significant contribution of cnv to the pathogenesis of chd.

high diagnostic yields provided strong supporting evidence to justify the routine use of cma test in clinical evaluation of patients with chd. while diagnostic yield is important, we are also interested to assess the clinical utility of cma test for patients with chd. a follow-up study will be focusing on how the cma test results impact patient care and management.

discovering novel chd loci and candidate genes through cnv detection
in this study, the top five most frequently detected genomic imbalance events in chd cases were 22q <dig>  deletion/duplication, 8p <dig>  deletion/duplication, trisomy  <dig>  monosomy x and 4q terminal deletion. the first four genomic imbalances are known to be causally related to chd. tbx <dig> and gata <dig> are the known key causative genes for chd phenotypes for 22q <dig>  and 8p <dig> , respectively. the fact that all five 4q terminal deletion cases were detected in chd patients and none in the control strongly supports the notion that 4q terminal deletion is a novel chd-causing locus.

4q terminal deletion is a subgroup of 4q- syndrome, which has chd in about 50% of the cases. our five patients presented different chd phenotypes, including ctd, hypoplastic left ventricle, septal defects and obstruction of left ventricular outflow tract. additionally, three of them have comorbid features of extracardiac presentations . a cardiovascular critical region  has been mapped for the 4q- syndrome, and three genes  were proposed to be the key genes responsible for the cardiovascular phenotypes
 <cit> . interestingly, the sor region of our five 4q terminal deletion cases does not overlap with this cardiovascular critical region , suggesting that our  <dig>  mb region represents a novel chd critical locus.

4q terminal deletions often co-occur with terminal duplications of other chromosome as a consequence of imbalanced segregation of a balanced parental translocation. in our study, the three largest 4q terminal deletion cases also carried terminal duplications on another chromosome . the fact that the other involved chromosomes were different in each case and that the remaining two cases only carried the pathogenic 4q terminal deletion makes a strong argument that it is the genes within the 4q terminal deletion region, not on the other involved chromosomes, that are causal for chd phenotype. through literature review, we identified two other chd cases with small 4q terminal deletions that overlapped with our sor region . all three 4q terminal deletions involved the sorbs <dig> gene, encoding a signal transducer that is highly and nearly exclusively expressed in epithelia and cardiac muscle tissue in the mouse embryo . strong expression in cardiac tissue suggests that this gene may play a significant role in heart development. several previous studies also support the sorbs <dig> gene as a critical gene for chd
.our sor and case  <dig>  also contained the pdlim <dig> gene. the functional disruption of pdlim <dig> in mice results in right ventricular dysmorphogenesis, trabeculation failure, and chamber dilatation
 <cit> , supporting the involvement of this gene in heart development. maurin et al. suggested both pdlim <dig> and sorbs <dig> were involved in cardiac and muscle development, and could be responsible for cardiac defects observed in terminal 4q <dig>  deletions
 <cit> . additionally, the slc25a <dig> gene , which encodes a member of the mitochondrial carrier subfamily of solute carrier protein, was previously associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
 <cit>  and showed high expression in mouse embryonic heart . in fact, one case with 4q terminal deletion in our study presented with cardiomyopathy. it is currently unknown if any single gene at 4q terminal is sufficient to cause chd, or if chd occurs due to multiple gene deletion. based on the above analysis, we propose that sorbs <dig>  pdlim <dig> and slc25a <dig> are the critical genes associated with 4q terminal deletion for the chd phenotype.

recurrent deletions at locus 15q <dig>  were statistically enriched in our chd cohort. the region between bp <dig> and bp <dig> at 15q <dig>  has been previously implicated as a contributory genetic cause of susceptibility to schizophrenia, behavioral disturbances, and intellectual disability
 <cit> . it is well known that the 15q <dig>  deletion has low penetrance 
 <cit> . soemedi et al. was the first one to report the strong association of this variant with the risk of multiple heart defects, especially left-sided malformations
 <cit> . however, no additional study followed. our study provides independent support for the contributory role of 15q <dig>  in chd pathogenesis. we detected a total of  <dig> cases with 15q <dig>  deletion. three of them  exhibited chd phenotypes. thus the penetrance of 15q <dig>  deletion for chd is also low. additional genetic factors may be required for the manifestation of chd.

we also identified three 16p <dig>  microdeletions involving the eef2k and cdr <dig> genes, which have been previously linked to intellectual disability and neuropsychiatric phenotypes
 <cit> . other features including cardiac anomalies are frequently observed in individuals with 16p <dig>  deletion. girirajan et al. identified seven individuals with chd phenotype out of 21cases carrying this imbalance
 <cit> , suggesting its significant predisposing role to heart malformations. in our study, three out of five patients with 16p <dig>  deletion exhibited chd phenotype, demonstrating a relative high chd penetrance of this imbalance.

cnvs detected in chd patients provide a unique source for identifying novel chd candidate genes. in this study, using gene prioritization approaches, we identified  <dig> novel candidate genes . we gathered additional supporting evidence including gene expression and mouse phenotype . we found that all of them had positive expression in mouse embryonic or adult heart. some genes such as ets <dig>  nfatc <dig>  cnn <dig> and rps6ka <dig> exhibited a high expression level. the knock-out mice of all genes in deletion cnvs  exhibited abnormal cardiovascular development. of note, mice homozygotes for the targeted null allele of crk, efnb <dig>  hey <dig>  nfatc <dig> and shh display defects in heart morphogenesis. although the function of these genes on human heart development is still poorly studied, two heterozygous mutations in nfatc <dig> were recently reported in a patient with tricuspid atresia
 <cit> , and another recent study supported that nfatc <dig> plays an important role in cardiac development
 <cit> . for genes in duplication cnvs, dll <dig> knock-in mice and mice with mutations of the qki gene displayed chd involving impaired blood vessel morphology and abnormal heart looping. taken together, these  <dig> genes are considered to be the most likely candidate chd genes. mutation screening in human chd patients and functional studies will provide further evidence to demonstrate their causal relevance with chd.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the high clinical diagnostic yield of cma for patients with chd justify cma to be used as a first-tier genetic test. syndromic chd cases are expected to have a much higher pathogenic cnv detection rate. cma also provides diagnostic value for isolated chd patients. the cnvs detected in chd patients represent a wealth of chd candidate genes that warrant further investigation.
