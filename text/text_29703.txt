BACKGROUND
enormous amount of data has been generated by the use of high-throughput analytical methods in biology during the last two decades. however, the inherited properties of these data create significant problems in their analysis and interpretation. standard statistical approaches are not powerful enough to dissect data with thousands of variables  and limited sample sizes . these properties are typical in microarray and proteomic datasets  <cit>  as well as other high dimensional data where a comparison is made to biological samples that tend to be limited in number, thus suffering from curse of dimensionality  <cit> .

one approach to address the curse of dimensionality is to integrate multiple large data sets with prior biological knowledge. this approach offers a solution to tackle the challenging task of inferring transcriptional regulatory networks . transcriptional regulation is a process that needs to be understood at multiple levels of description  <cit>   including  the factor-target gene interaction, in which transcription factors  activated under certain conditions interact with their conserved binding site sequences; and  transcriptional regulation, which explains how the bindings of tfs to their unique recognition sites regulate the expression of specific genes. a single source of information such as gene expression data is aimed at only one level of description , thus it is limited in its ability to obtain a full understanding of the entire regulatory process. other types of information such as tf â€“ binding site sequence relationships revealed by genome-wide location analysis  <cit>  provide complementary constraints on the models of regulatory processes. by integrating limited but complementary data sources, we can realize a mutually consistent hypothesis bearing stronger similarity to the underlying causal structures  <cit> . among the various types of high-throughput biological data available nowadays, time course gene expression profiles and genomic analysis data are two complementary sets of information that can be used to infer regulatory components. time course gene expression data are advantageous over typical static expression profiles as time can be used to disambiguate causal interactions. binding site sequence data based on the analysis of genomic loci, on the other hand, provide high-throughput quantitative information about in vivo binding of transcriptional activators to the target regulatory regions of the dna. prior biological knowledge generated by geneticists will help guide inference from the above data sets and integration of multiple data sources offers insights into the cellular system at different levels.

a number of researches have explored the integration of multiple data sources  for trn inference  <cit> . a typical approach for exploiting two or more data sources uses one type of data to validate the results generated independently from the other . for example, cluster analysis of gene expression data followed by the identification of consensus sequence motifs in the promoters of genes within each cluster  <cit> . the underlying assumption behind this approach is that genes co-expressed under varying experimental conditions are likely to be co-regulated by the same tf or sets of tfs. holmes et al.  <cit>  constructed a joint likelihood score based on consensus sequence motif and gene expression data and used this score to perform clustering. segal et al.  <cit>  built relational probabilistic models by incorporating gene expression and functional category information as input variables. gene expression data and gene ontology  data were combined for trn discovery in b cell  <cit> . computational methodologies that allow systematic integration of data from multiple resources are needed to fully utilize the complementary information available in those resources.

another way to reduce the complexity of the trn inference problem is to decompose it into simple units of commonly used network structures. trn is a network of interactions between tfs and the genes they regulate, governing many of the biological activities in cells. breaking down the trn into simplest units of commonly used network architectures helps in understanding complex biological networks. such patterns of local interconnections are called network motifs   <cit> . since the establishment of the first nm in escherichia coli  <cit> , similar nms have also been found in eukaryotes including yeast  <cit> , plants, and animals  <cit> , suggesting that the general structure of nms are evolutionarily conserved. one well known family of nms is the feed-forward loop   <cit> , which appears in hundreds of gene systems in e. coli  <cit>  and yeast  <cit> , as well as in other organisms  <cit> . a comprehensive review on nm theory and experimental approaches is currently available  <cit> . knowledge of the nms to which a given tf belongs facilitates the identification of downstream target gene clusters. in yeast, a genome-wide location analysis was carried out for  <dig> tfs and five nms were considered significant: autoregulation, ffl, single input module, multi-input module and regulator cascade. the first four nms are transcriptionally related, while the last one reflects the signalling pathway activities beyond transcriptional regulation.

in this study, we developed a computational framework that integrates information from time course gene expression experiment, genomic location analysis, binding site sequence, and go category information to infer the relationship between tfs and their potential target genes based on known and predicted nms. this was accomplished through a three-step approach outlined in the following. first, we applied cluster analysis of time course gene expression profiles to reduce dimensionality and use the go category information to determine biologically meaningful clusters, upon which a model of the regulatory module is built. this step enables us to address the scalability problem that is faced by researchers in inferring trns from time course gene expression data with limited time points. second, we trained support vector machines  to classify tfs into different nms based on their time course gene expression profiles, location analysis data, and target binding site sequences. the resulting svm classifiers were utilized to predict nms for tfs with unknown nms. finally, we used recurrent neural network  models that mimic the topology of nms to identify gene clusters that may be regulated by a tf, thereby inferring the regulatory relationships between the tfs and gene clusters. a hybrid of genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization  methods was applied to train the rnn models. we tested the proposed computational framework using changes in gene expression associated with cell cycle progression in yeast  <cit> , genomic location data  <cit> , binding site sequences  <cit> , and corresponding go category information  <cit> .

RESULTS
clustering genes into groups with enrichment for biological functions
we selected  <dig> cell cycle-regulated genes and grouped them into clusters by fuzzy c-means , where genes with similar expression profiles are represented by a gene cluster or a metagene. the optimal cluster number is determined by the mutual information between gene clusters and their go annotations . we compared the performance of fcm clustering with two different m values and the k-means clustering . the highest z-score  was obtained when the number of clusters is  <dig> by fcm clustering with m =  <dig> . we evaluated the resulting clusters through the gene set enrichment analysis  method. table  <dig> presents the  <dig> clusters and their corresponding enriched go categories. all clusters except  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are enriched in some go categories. details of all clusters are provided in additional file  <dig>  we used these clusters as metagenes in our subsequent analyses to reduce the search space for tf-target gene relationship inference.

 to evaluate whether the gene clusters are enriched in some known biological function or process, we performed gsea for gene clusters generated from fcm clustering with m =  <dig>  and c =  <dig>  the cut off p-value is  <dig> . the enriched function are listed in the table. significant function are correlated with all gene clusters except cluster  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

predicting nms for tfs
 <dig> proteins were identified as dna-binding transcriptional regulators in the yeast genome  <cit> . a genome-wide location analysis was carried out for  <dig> tfs and five nms were considered significant . the first four nms are transcriptionally related , while the last one reflects the signaling pathway activities beyond transcriptional regulation . the  <dig> tfs include about 52% of the known tfs in the yeast genome.

among the  <dig> cell cycle related genes,  <dig> have been identified to have tf-related functions based on their go annotation. out of these,  <dig> tfs have known nms. a list of  <dig> tfs is presented in additional file  <dig>  we used data from  <dig> tfs to train svm classifiers with time course gene expression profile and binding site sequence data as inputs to classify the tfs into four nms. we retrieved the binding site sequence data for the tfs from the transfac database  <cit> . for tfs with unknown binding site sequences, we used the discovered binding site sequences described by harbison et al.  <cit> .

the trained svm classifiers were evaluated and optimized using the loocv method. the final svm classifiers were utilized to predict the nms for  <dig> tfs with unknown nms. through the loocv method, we evaluated if both gene expression profile and binding site sequence information are needed in assigning tfs to nm categories. when we used gene expression profile alone as input to svm, the average test error was  <dig> %. after incorporating binding sequence data into the input data, the test error was reduced to  <dig> % . the increased performance implies that the encoded binding site sequence information is useful in predicting the critical tfs.

to evaluate the performance of the svm classifiers, loocv was performed. to examine whether both gene expression data and binding site sequence information are needed in classifying tfs into different nm categories, we built svm classifiers using only gene expression data. if only gene expression data are considered as input data, the average test error is  <dig> %. after incorporating binding sequence data into the input data, test error has been reduced  <dig> %. the increased performance implies that the encoded binding site sequence information is useful in predicting the biological roles tfs play.

inferring tf-target gene relationships in yeast
recurrent neural network  models that mimic the topology of the known/predicted nms were constructed to identify the relationships between tfs and putative gene clusters. the rnn models were trained to select for all  <dig> tfs the downstream targets from the  <dig> gene clusters.

the average and least root mean square errors  obtained between the output of rnn and the measured expression profile for the gene clusters are shown as the number of ga generation is varied from  <dig> to  <dig> 

we evaluated the predicted tf-target gene relationships for the following eight well known cell cycle related tfs: swi <dig>  swi <dig>  fkh <dig>  ndd <dig>  ace <dig>  kar <dig>  met <dig> and rap <dig>  among these, the first five have nm assignments, while the last three were assigned to different nms by the svm classifiers. since the "true" gene regulatory network was not available, the accuracy of putative regulatory relationship was determined by searching known gene connections in databases. based on the results of the nm module prediction, we collected literature evidences from sgd  <cit>  and bind  <cit>  databases. we examined the inferred relationships for each of the eight tfs. an inferred relationship is assumed to be biologically significant if the tfs are correlated with the biological functions associated with the critical downstream cluster. figure  <dig> lists the significant relationships; the eight tfs yielded an average precision of  <dig> %. we calculated the precision as tp/, where tp and fp denote true positive and false positive, respectively. network motifs for four of these tfs were identified in chiang et al.  <cit>  together with other four tfs. the eight tfs in  <cit>  yielded an average precision of  <dig> %.

discussion
the main goal of this study was to infer the components and underlying mechanism of gene regulation in yeast based on the combined constraints from multiple information sources. our method effectively utilizes genomic location analysis for the establishment of nm for each tf. target genes are grouped into biologically meaningful clusters and are represented by the average expression profiles of the genes in the cluster. cluster analysis coupled with the idea of categorizing tfs into pre-defined nms increased the robustness of our analysis not only in terms of obtaining meaningful modules, but also in terms of addressing the scalability problem. some genes are very important in biological processes, thus are regulated through multiple pathways as shown by the presence of several distinct binding site sequences. our proposed method allows the representation of a gene in different regulatory nms since a tf can be assigned to more than one nm. this is different from previous approaches where only a single model is used for trn inference  <cit> .

compared to previous methods that aimed at global trn inference, the tf-target gene relationships inferred in this study are expected to correspond more closely to biologically meaningful regulatory systems and naturally lend themselves to optimum experimental design methods. for example, the results presented in figure  <dig> can be verified from previous biological evidences. for example, fkh <dig> is a gene whose protein product is a fork head family protein with a role in the expression of g2/m phase genes. it negatively regulates transcriptional elongation, and regulates donor preference during switching. to further investigate the possibilities that the predicted downstream gene clusters are truly regulated by fkh <dig>  we applied the motif discovery tool, webmotifs  <cit>  to find shared motifs in these gene clusters. the results revealed that a motif called fork_head, gtaaacaa, is identified as the most significant motif among these gene clusters  <cit> . this finding strongly supports our nm inference results. the details of the binding site enrichment analysis  results are shown in additional file  <dig>  another example is the ffl involving swi <dig>  gat <dig> and gene cluster  <dig>  swi <dig> has been identified as the upstream regulator of gat <dig>  <cit> . genes in cluster  <dig> are mostly involved in dna helicase activity and mitotic recombination, both of which are important biological steps in the regulation of cell cycle. although no biological evidences have shown that swi <dig> and gat <dig> are involved in these processes, there are significant numbers of genes in cluster  <dig> which are characterized  as genes regulated by both tfs .

compared to chiang et al.  <cit> , the first improvement of our approach is that instead of predicting the tf and individual downstream genes, we group genes into biologically functional clusters and discover the relationships between tfs and gene clusters. through clustering, we were able to integrate the go information, reduce the computational complexity, and established insights into new interactions. if a gene cluster is involved in the nm of one tf, and most genes have evidence that they are regulated by this tf, it is most likely that the genes left in this cluster are under the regulatory control of the tf. furthermore, the intermediate result analysis such as gsea and motif discovery analysis employed in our method ensure that every step in the data integration contributes to the final nm inference.

CONCLUSIONS
reconstruction of trns is one of the major challenges in post genomic era. the study presented here addressed two important issues in trn inference:  the development of analysis methods that utilizes multiple types of data and  network analysis on the nm level. a data integration approach is proposed to effectively infer the underlying mechanism and pattern of gene regulation using yeast as model on the basis of combined constraints arising from multiple biological data sources, including time course gene expression data, location analysis data, binding site sequence data and go category information. this computational framework allows us to fully exploit the partial constraints that can be inferred from each data source. first, to reduce the inference dimensionalities, the genes are grouped into clusters by fcm, where the optimal fuzziness value is determined by statistical properties of gene expression data and the optimal cluster number is identified by integrating the go category information. then, the known nm information from location data analysis together with the binding site information is used to train svm classifiers. tfs without nm assignment are predicted by the classifiers. loocv is used to build the svm classifiers with high confidence. once the nm for a tf is identified, the hybrid ga-pso algorithm is applied to search for target gene clusters that may be regulated by the tf. this search is guided by the successful training of a rnn model that mimics the regulatory nm assigned to the tf. this has been demonstrated on eight well-studied yeast cell cycle dependent tfs. the upstream bsea indicates that the proposed method has the potential to identify the underlying regulatory relationships between tfs and their downstream genes on the nm level. we conducted a thorough evaluation of our approach by applying it to a well studied process in yeast . although we limited our analysis to gene regulatory program at the transcriptional level, we believe that our model is expandable to other biological network inference as more types of high-through data become available such as protein-protein interaction data  and in vivo  and in vitro  protein-dna interaction data. we anticipate that this approach will serve as a novel method for analyzing multi-source data on the nm level.
