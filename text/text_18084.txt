BACKGROUND
naturally derived products are the most valuable source for drugs and their lead compounds. approximately 74% of anticancer drugs are either natural products or their derivatives  <cit> . curcumin,  <dig> -bis- <dig> -heptadiene- <dig> -dione, is a dietary constituent of turmeric. it is well known for its ability to suppress tumor growth  <cit> . the mechanisms of its tumor suppression have been examined at the molecular level. curcumin is known to interfere with the transactivation of nuclear factor-κb   <cit> , activator protein  <dig>  <cit> , and β-catenin  <cit>  thus resulting in the negative regulation of various oncogenes such as c-myc, cyclin d <dig>  bcl- <dig>  and bcl-xl. curcumin arrests the cell cycle at g0/g <dig> and/or g2/m through the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p <dig> and p <dig>  and the downregulation of cdc <dig> and cyclin b <dig>  <cit> . curcumin blocks signaling of growth factors, including human epidermal growth factor receptor- <dig>  <cit> , platelet-derived growth factor  <cit>  and fibroblast growth factor  <cit> . it also blocks wnt signalling  <cit> . curcumin also has anti-invasive, antimetastastic, and antiangiogenic properties  <cit> . therefore, curcumin is labeled as a multi-targeted drug. however, the systemic availability of curcumin remains negligible  <cit> . hydrophobicity, low absorption, and rapid metabolism have been considered as reasons for curcumin's low bioavailability  <cit> . to address this issue, we synthesized a series of curcumin analogs and screened them. an analog named go-y <dig> was synthesized that possessed 30- to 50-fold enhanced antiproliferative potential against various types of cancers in vitro  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms of go-y <dig> closely resembled those of curcumin. oral administration of go-y <dig> prevented the adenoma formation in the familial adenomatous polyposis  mouse model without any apparent toxicity  <cit> . it was also demonstrated that the number and the size of β-catenin-positive adenomas were reduced. in this case, bioavailability of go yo <dig> was not an issue because it can be directly delivered to the gastrointestinal tract. however, go-y <dig> was hydrophobic and ineffective to the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis  of gastric carcinoma in a mouse model. these observations led us to additionally synthesize hyperactive curcumin analogs in order to optimize their pharmacological potential.

RESULTS
screening of the hyperactive growth inhibitors among the newly synthesized curcumin analogs
eighty eight curcumin analogs, including  <dig> species of dops, curcumin and  <dig> -diaryl- <dig> -heptadiene- <dig> -dione, and  <dig> species of non-dop analogs were synthesized . the growth-suppressive potential of these compounds was then examined on cell panels composed of  <dig> types of cancers. these included gastric cancers , colon cancers , lung cancer , pancreatic cancer , kidney cancer , liver cancer , ovarian cancer , breast cancer , skin cancer , bile duct cancer , thyroid cancer , melanoma , and prostate cancer . the ic <dig> value of each analog was calculated against the individual cell line. these values were analyzed using cluster analysis . resulting from the pattern of inhibition,  <dig> curcuminoids were divided into  <dig> clusters; one is the high ic <dig> group  composed of  <dig> analogs, and the other is the low ic <dig> group  composed of  <dig> analogs. in detail of group a,  <dig> %  of those are dops, whereas  <dig> %  are dops in group b. from the view point of dops,  <dig> out of  <dig>  belong to group b. in this study,  <dig> species out of  <dig> analogs are classified to acyclic dops, and  <dig> % species  of acyclic dops belong to group b. on the other hand, among  <dig> non-dops,  <dig> % species belong to group a. the analogs that exhibited the strongest potential against all of the cell lines were clustered in group c . this cluster included go-y <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  all of these compounds had at least  <dig> times higher growth-suppressive potential than curcumin. for example, the value of go-y <dig> reached  <dig> times, go-y <dig>  <dig> times, and go-y <dig>  <dig> times higher than curcumin against gciy. in the solution, as each ethoxyethyl group of go-y <dig> and  <dig> is predicted to be hydrolyzed in an acidic environment, and go-y <dig> and go-y <dig> can convert themselves to  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. essentially, go-y <dig> is nearly identical to  <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig>  just as shown in the cluster analysis. for this reason, we excluded go-y <dig> and  <dig> from further examination. in this analysis, it has been shown a <dig> and mcf <dig> were rather resistant to curcumin analogs among them .

improvement in solubility of curcumin analogs
the adme profiles of  <dig> curcuminoids, including virtual analogous compounds were determined in silico. concerning solubility of analogs, the predicted values of top  <dig> are represented in the bar graph . analogs, that bear the improved solubility than curcumin and belong to group b at the same time, are  <dig> compounds including go-y <dig> and y <dig>  the predictive values of them are  <dig>  and  <dig>  times higher than curcumin, respectively. the highest predictive value is  <dig>  mg/l of go-y <dig>  which is  <dig>  times higher than curcumin. as for go-y <dig>  the solubility is  <dig>  times lower than curcumin. then, we practically examined the solubility of curcumin, go-y <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . these compounds were first dissolved in ethanol-cremophor el® and then diluted in pbs. concentration of go-y <dig> in ethanol-cremophor el® reached the highest level among them at  <dig> mm. while there were no aggregations seen in go-y <dig> and  <dig> solutions after  <dig> serial dilutions, the appearance of aggregation was observed in curcumin and go-y <dig> solutions immediately after the first dilution . in fact, go-y <dig> and  <dig> showed increased solubility, as predicted.

growth suppression and apoptosis induction potencies of go-y <dig>   <dig>  and 098
to examine the growth suppression of  <dig> dop analogs, go-y <dig>  y <dig>  and y <dig> clustered in group c, the analysis of cell cycle progression in hct <dig> cells was conducted by flow cytometry. analysis of cell cycle progression indicated the increase of the subg <dig> fraction. those treated with go-y <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> at  <dig> μm were  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. these values were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  times higher than curcumin at the same concentration . go-y <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> may have a stronger potency to induce apoptosis than curcumin. to further elucidate this observation, caspase cleavage reactions were assessed. at a dose of  <dig> μm, the amount of cleaved product in go-y <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> treatments were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  times higher, respectively, than curcumin. go-y <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were also considered to be potent inducers of apoptosis .

go-y <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> can induce apoptosis through numerous mechanisms just as curcumin
generally, cancer cells have some breakdown in key apoptosis induction mechanisms. these include the inactivation of a cohort of nf-κb target genes, as well as inactivation of the tp <dig> pathway, and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. hyperactivated nf-κb in cancer cells leads to protection from apoptotic cell death via its targets including iaps. it is well documented that curcumin can inhibit nf-κb transactivation  <cit> . the inhibitory effects of nf-κb transactivation in  <dig> dop analogs, were examined by elisa. in this assay, nf-κb transactivation was estimated by the amount of p <dig> subunit binding to its dna consensus sequence. nf-κb p <dig> activates a set of target genes in response to certain inflammatory signals, such as tnfα. in this study, curcumin and dop analogs decreased tnfα-induced nf-κb transactivation at a dose of  <dig> μm. the relative values of transactivation with curcumin, go-y <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  compared to the control  . these dops were shown to have comparative potency to curcumin in the inhibition of nf-κb transactivation.

the p <dig> gene is altered in nearly half of human cancers, usually by point mutations, and results in the loss of ability to induce pro-apoptotic genes. following  <dig> h of treatment, tp <dig> induction was assessed in hct <dig> cells bearing wild-type p <dig> as a control. after treatment with a  <dig> μm dose, the tp <dig> expression in curcumin-treated cells was similar to the control level, while the levels of tp <dig> in go-y <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were increased  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  times higher, respectively, than the control. . activating certain death receptors , particularly dr <dig> and dr <dig>  has been shown to selectively kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells  <cit> . curcumin activates dr <dig>  but does not activate dr <dig>  <cit> . dr <dig> is regulated by either a p53-dependent or -independent mechanism  <cit> . dr <dig> overexpression induces ligand-independent apoptosis  <cit> . the expression of dr <dig> was estimated in dld- <dig> bearing mutant tp <dig>  by western blotting. after  <dig> h of incubation, the expression of dr <dig> was increased to  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  times higher than the control, in go- <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> treated cells, respectively . it was shown that the apoptosis induction potency, including overexpression of tp <dig> and dr <dig> was improved, but nf-κb inhibition was not.

therapeutic effects of dop analogs in an experimental mouse model
according to the data concerning solubility described above, go-y <dig> and  <dig> may have improved bioavailability. initially, the toxicity of these compounds was examined in vitro. we examined the growth suppression of the primary normal liver cells, hnheps® with go-y <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  they do not affect survival nor have any toxic effects to hnheps® at doses as high as  <dig> μm. then, we conducted a single ip injection, and determining the maximum tolerable dose . the mtds of go-y <dig> and  <dig> were determined to be  <dig>  and  <dig> mg/kg, respectively. administration of these doses did not affect the animals for over  <dig> month. however, the mtd of go-y <dig> was rather toxic at a dose below  <dig> mg/kg, and this compound was excluded from further examination. the compounds were then applied to the mouse model of pc with gciy, a gastric cancer notorious for its rapid progression  <cit> . the pc progresses very rapidly, and increases in ascites fluid and comparative weight gain continues until the animal dies. as a result, mortality occurs within  <dig> month following tumor inoculation. experimental treatment was carried out as shown in figure 5a. the ip administration of curcumin had no effect on the pc model, where the average body weight of untreated group reached to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of that before treatment, whereas that treated with curcumin to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . go-y <dig> had a significant antitumor effect on pc progression , but no survival benefit was observed . similar to that of go-y <dig>  go-y <dig> showed a significant suppression of pc progression. at the 17th day after the first treatment, the average body weight of the untreated group was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g due to increased ascites fluid accumulation, while that of the treated group was significantly less at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g . the average body weight before inoculation was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g, therefore the ascites fluid accumulation was considered to be completely suppressed by go-y <dig> treatment. survival time of the untreated group  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> days, with a median survival time  of  <dig> days. survival time of the go-y <dig> treated group  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> days, with a mst of  <dig>  days. treatment with go-y <dig> led to an approximate 40% increase in survival time. log-rank analysis significantly indicated a survival benefit of go-y <dig> treatment . judging from these results, the bioavailability of go-y <dig> is significantly higher than go-y <dig>  in order to examine why the survival was limited in the go-y <dig> treated mice, despite the fact that the ascites fluid accumulation disappeared completely. when necropsies were performed, in nearly all of the go-y078-treated mice, residual cancer cells were observed to colonize around the stomach, pancreas, bile duct, and duodenum. direct invasion to the pancreas, liver, and duodenum was thought to be the causes of death.

discussion
dop analogs possess common structural feature, that is an electrophilic α,β-unsaturated ketone, which reacts with nucleophilic groups through the michael addition. then, the ketone binds covalently with thiol groups of cysteine residues in different proteins  <cit> . as thiol group does not exist in dna, curcuminoids do not attach dna itself, different from the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. two independent proteins can be alkylated through two α,β-unsaturated double bonds in dop that stretch from the center ketone moiety toward both ends  <cit> . in this alkylation, an association of a cysteine protease, such as caspase, and its target protein may assist in the catalytic reaction of caspase, resulting in target degradation. in our previous study, we observed that dop analogs increased caspase activity, and a caspase inhibitor inhibited the degradation of β-catenin or kras by dop analogs  <cit> . although this contention remains unproven, perhaps this center structure of dop confering michael addition is responsible for the multi-targeted nature of curcuminoids. contribution to enhanced potency by the alteration from a diketone to a monoketone also remains to be elucidated. shortening the chemical distance by alkylation through conversion from a di- to monoketone structure may result in an enhanced potential. acyclic dop analogs have an enhanced cytotoxicity  <cit> . substitution in each aromatic ring could improve solubility and the resultant pharmaceutical potency. as the symmetry of the attachment group of each aromatic ring is not necessary, further improvement of solubility may be achievable by various types of substitution in this portion  <cit> . the hydrophilic nature and total positioning of the attached groups in a compound can reflect the potency of the analogs. in this study, the maximum ic <dig> value of dop analogs reached a level that was  <dig> times lower than curcumin. the data, that curcuminoids could only affect the malignant growth, lead to the hypothesis that the growth-suppressive potential of these analogs depends on the degradation of oncoproteins that are overexpressed in malignant cells. that might be a reason why curcuminoids are rather safe to normal cells.

furthermore, it has been shown that some of dop analogs induce more cell death to cancer cells, compared with curcumin. apoptosis related proteins, such as tp <dig> and dr <dig> were up-regulated with dop analogs more efficiently than curcumin. however, the precise mechanisms of up-regulation are still unknown  <cit> . cancer cells invent numerous ways to inactivate many of the apoptotic pathways. the pluripotent apoptosis induction by curcuminoids could overcome complexity of antiapoptosis in cancer cells. one of dop analog, go-y <dig> has shown survival benefit in mouse pc model for the first time. that could not be achieved by go-y <dig>  although these two dops presented the same level of ic <dig> values, the predicted solubility of go-y <dig> was  <dig>  mg/l, whereas that of go-y <dig> was  <dig>  mg/l. in fact, go-y <dig> was less soluble compared with go-y <dig>  the difference of solubility between go-y <dig> and go-y <dig> probably influences the difference in their survival benefits in the pc models. moreover, additional times of administration of go-y <dig> may lead to further improved survival. combined treatment with conventional cytotoxic agents, such as 5-fu and taxanes, or a dr <dig> ligand, for example, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand , may synergistically induce better outcomes  <cit> . recently, off-target toxicity has become a problem in molecular-targeted medicines which have already been approved  <cit> . some of the potent dop analogs may not be as safe as dietary curcumin, shown with go-y <dig>  and we should be cautious against that during development.

CONCLUSIONS
synthesis of dop analogs represented by go-y <dig> can overcome low bioavailability of curcumin, yielding good lead compounds for new cancer chemotherapeutic agents bearing multi-target properties.
