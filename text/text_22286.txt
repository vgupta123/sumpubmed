BACKGROUND
the cystoviridae are a family of bacteriophages having genomes consisting of three segments of double-stranded rna . the rna is contained within a polyhedral capsid which is enveloped in a lipid-containing membrane  <cit> . Φ <dig> was the first and the most thoroughly studied member of this family. the packaging of the Φ <dig> genome was found to progress through a program that involves the sequential packaging of the plus strands of segments s, m and l in that order  <cit> . this program is rather stringent for Φ <dig> in that segment s can be packaged alone while m requires prior packaging of s and l requires prior packaging of m. segment l can be packaged to some extent with only prior packaging of s but this is much less efficient than the normal packaging  <cit> . the cystoviridae are the only family of rna viruses that are reliably known to package their genomic segments into preformed capsids. although the reoviridae have an inner core particle structure strikingly similar to that of the cystoviridae, their mechanisms of genomic packaging have not yet been determined  <cit> . packaging in the cystoviridae is driven by an ntpase motor comprised of a hexamer of protein p <dig>  <cit> . the plus strands of Φ <dig> have an  <dig> base consensus sequence at the 5' end and at about  <dig> bases downstream, a sequence of about  <dig> nucleotides that is necessary and sufficient for packaging into procapsids. the  <dig> nucleotide sequence is called pac and it is unique for each segment, with very limited identity in sequence between the three segments. minus strand synthesis begins after the completion of the plus strand packaging and plus strand synthesis begins after minus strand synthesis is completed. a model has been proposed that involves the programmed changes in the binding sites for plus strands on the surface of the procapsid as a function of the amount of rna in the particle  <cit> .

the pac sequences of Φ <dig> were defined by deletion analysis of the plus strand transcripts of plasmids carrying cdna copies of the genomic segments. in vitro packaging was used to assess the success of packaging of transcripts harboring a series of deletions. it was found that the pac sequences ended about  <dig> nucleotides before the first open reading frames  of the segments  <cit> . the pac sequences showed considerable secondary structure, with a number of stem-loops  <cit> . comparison of the pac sequences of close relatives of Φ <dig> suggested that the stem-loop structures were important because base changes preserved the stems in a number of cases  <cit> . Φ <dig> is the most distantly related member of the cystoviridae relative to Φ <dig>  it has no sequence identity or similarity to Φ <dig> and it has significant differences in genetic and physical structure  <cit> . our aim was to determine whether Φ <dig> genomic packaging uses pac sequences in a manner similar to that found for Φ <dig>  whereas the pac sequences were defined in Φ <dig> by in vitro packaging studies, we have found that in vitro packaging for Φ <dig> is non-specific when evaluated by the uptake of radioactive rna  <cit> . we have therefore used in vivo transcript acquisition to define the pac sequences of Φ <dig> in this report.

RESULTS
the determination of the pac sequences of Φ8
the pac sequences of Φ <dig> were determined by deletion analysis  <cit> . plus strand transcripts of cdna plasmids were prepared with deletions near the 5' ends of particular genomic segments. these rna molecules were incubated with procapsids and the two other wild type transcripts. minus strand synthesis was then used as the measure of packaging efficiency, since minus strand synthesis was found to be dependent upon packaging of the three genomic segments. it was found that the pac sequences ended about  <dig> nucleotides before the first open reading frames . these orf positions were at nucleotides  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for segments s, m and l respectively. in the case of Φ <dig> the first reading frames in segments s, m and l begin at nucleotides  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively  <cit> . this would put the ends of the pac sequences at about  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for s, m and l if the same relationship to orfs is operating in Φ <dig> as in Φ <dig>  we have done deletion analysis on segments s, m and l and measured the efficacy of plasmid transcript acquisition into infectious phage as a measure of packaging success. plasmid transcript acquisition is effected by the introduction of non replicating cdna plasmids into cells by electroporation. the transcripts of the plasmids produce live phage if they are packaged and if they contain all of the necessary genes. if a particular transcript lacks a functional pac sequence, it will not be packaged and live phage will not be produced. with normal wild type transcripts one finds thousands of infectious centers produced. we found that the pac sequences are located in the 5' untranslated region of the plus strands but that they are closer to the first orfs than found for Φ <dig>  whereas many of the small changes in the pac sequences of Φ <dig> resulted in diminutions of the order of one hundred fold in acquisition frequency  <cit> , changes of this type in Φ <dig> generally led to changes of less than ten fold .

segment l
a deletion of nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> in l does not interfere with packaging . although this deletion involves gene  <dig>  the gene product is not required for plaque formation. deletions starting at nucleotide  <dig> or earlier compromise packaging severely or completely . deletions from  <dig> to  <dig> are also tolerated if gene hb is complemented in trans . the downstream end of the pac sequence is consequently located in the region between nucleotides  <dig> and  <dig> and therefore between  <dig> and  <dig> bases upstream of the gene  <dig> orf.

segment m
a deletion of  <dig> to  <dig> in m compromises segment acquisition; and deletion of the bamhi site at  <dig> compromises acquisition . creation of a hindiii site at position  <dig> does not reduce acquisition , but deletion of this site does . a deletion of bases  <dig> to  <dig> also compromises viability in m . therefore the downstream end of the pac sequence of m is located in the region of nucleotide  <dig> which places it either inside of gene  <dig> or close to it.

segment s
in the case of segment s we find that a deletion of nucleotides from  <dig> to  <dig> has little effect on the formation of viable phage . the deletion of  <dig> to  <dig> is interesting in that the stem at f  is recreated and the loop, nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig>  is maintained in the deletion structure . base changes and deletions in the loops of b, c, d and e do not show great diminution of packaging. larger deletions such as  <dig> to  <dig>  or  <dig> to  <dig>  completely abolished plaque formation. this would place the pac region somewhere between nucleotides  <dig> and  <dig>  which would make the pac region in Φ <dig> s about half the size of the corresponding region in Φ <dig>  but an examination of the consequences of base changes in the exterior of this region suggests a somewhat more complicated picture. the region between nucleotides  <dig> and  <dig> is very important; but changes in the region from  <dig> to  <dig> also are significant, suggesting that the pac region extends from about  <dig> to  <dig>  although loop f at position  <dig> to  <dig> is maintained in the deletion of  <dig> to  <dig>  the sequence of the loop can be changed  without compromising packaging. however changing bases  <dig> and  <dig>  prevents packaging. this suggests that the stem or the stem-loop junction may be more important than the loop. there is a stem loop structure from  <dig> to  <dig> with the loop uag at  <dig> . changing the uag to cuu has little effect . there are two u's that are unpaired in the stem and changing them so that they pair results in no change in packaging. but other changes in the stem result in poor packaging. it appears that the stems are more sensitive than the loops in the pac region in terms of interference with packaging. the downstream end of the pac sequence is again very close to, or even within, the first orf, which in this case is gene  <dig> .

the consequences of replacing the pac sequence of m with that of l
base changes within the pac regions of the Φ <dig> genome have resulted in the isolation of suppressor mutations in protein p <dig>  the major structural protein of the procapsid and the determinant of the rna binding sites. however, in the case of Φ <dig> we have found less stringency in the pac sequences and we have not found suppressor mutations in p <dig>  in the case of Φ <dig> it was found that suppressor mutations in p <dig> could also be isolated when conditions were established that were contrary to the packaging program  <cit> . packaging of segments m and l without segment s could be established in carrier states if suppressor mutations were promoted in gene  <dig>  <cit> . we had previously found that gene  <dig> was indispensable in Φ <dig>  thereby making it difficult to establish carrier states in the absence of segment s. we therefore set out to select for a condition where the m segment would have the pac sequence of l and that phage would be selected for with both the m and l segments having the same pac sequences.

we therefore set out to construct a plasmid with a cdna copy of segment m but with the pac sequence of segment l. a plasmid was prepared with the cdna copy of segment m. it was cut with bglii and xhoi which removed the first  <dig> nucleotides and replaced with bglii/smai fragment of a plasmid with a cdna copy of l. this places the first  <dig> nucleotides of l at the 5' end of segment m. this plasmid is called plm <dig>  electroporation of this plasmid along with plasmids containing normal copies of l and s into cells carrying plasmids expressing sp <dig> rna polymerase resulted in only one plaque as opposed to tens of thousands with normal wild type constructs . the rna of the resulting viable phage was analyzed and it was found that the pac sequence of l remained on segment m. gene  <dig> on segment l was cloned as cdna and inserted into a copy of normal segment l. the electroporation experiment was repeated with the original plasmids or with the normal s, the m segment with the l pac sequence and the new l plasmid containing the replacement of wild type gene  <dig> with that of the presumed mutant gene  <dig>  the original combination gave no plaques, while the combination with the new gene  <dig> gave thousands of plaques as did the new l plasmid with normal m and s . the yield from the latter test was ten times that of the electroporation with the chimeric m. sequencing of gene  <dig> showed that a single change at u4807c had occurred. reisolation of the small fragment between sites at  <dig> and  <dig> confirmed that this mutation was responsible for the ability to package the chimeric m. the amino acid change generated in protein p <dig> by the mutation is v242a. in Φ <dig>  all suppressor mutations involved in packaging have been in protein p <dig>  which is the major structural protein of the procapsid and the source of the specific binding sites for the plus strands of the genomic segments.

discussion
plus strands of the three genomic segments of bacteriophage Φ <dig> are packaged by core structures composed of proteins p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> . they bind to protein p <dig>  the major structural protein of the core and are translocated to the interior by hexamers of the ntpase p <dig>  we had worked out the identification of sequences necessary and sufficient for packaging in bacteriophage Φ <dig> by in vitro packaging experiments. a region near the 5' end designated as pac is necessary and sufficient for packaging. we have established that the pac sequences of Φ <dig> are located in the 5' untranslated regions of the plus strands. whereas the in vitro packaging of Φ <dig> is very stringent and specific, that of Φ <dig> was found to be non-specific when uptake of radioactive rna was being assayed. in vivo packaging was more specific  <cit> . we therefore established a system of in vivo transcript acquisition to test the sequence limits for the packaging of the Φ <dig> genome.

in this report, we have identified the pac regions for bacteriophage Φ <dig>  a distant relative of Φ <dig>  all three plus strands of Φ <dig> have a consensus sequence of  <dig> nucleotides at the 5' end. again, we have found that the pac regions occupy space in the 5' untranslated regions of the plus strands. although the pac regions of both Φ <dig> and Φ <dig> have many stem-loop structures, there is no sequence or structural similarity between the two sets. there is also no sequence similarity between the pac sequences of the three genomic segments of Φ <dig>  while the Φ <dig> pac sequences extend approximately to nucleotides  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for l, m and s respectively; those of Φ <dig> extend to near nucleotides  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the Φ <dig> pac sequences end closer to the first orfs than those of Φ <dig>  in the cases of segments s and m the pac sequences might overlap the first orfs. changes within the pac region of Φ <dig> segment s are less destructive of packaging than similar changes in pac regions of Φ <dig>  many changes are tolerated, and in some cases the effects of changes are suppressed by other changes in the pac sequences. in some cases it is possible to rationalize the suppression in terms of the structure shown by mfold  <cit> ; in other cases it is not clear why the suppression is effective. in Φ <dig>  we found little suppression due to changes in the pac sequences but we found suppressors by mutation in the sequence of p <dig>  the major structural protein of the core. genomic rna that is bound to procapsids can be cross-linked to protein p <dig>  <cit> . so far, we have not found suppressors of this type in Φ <dig> for changes in the pac sequences. however, we did obtain a suppressor mutation for another type of packaging program transgression. we found that we could exchange the pac sequence of l with that of m. the l segment could be packaged in this case if an amino acid change was present in p <dig> 

the experiments involving manipulation of the pac sequence of segment s indicate that the Φ <dig> packaging mechanism has a lower level of stringency than that of Φ <dig>  <cit> . is there a benefit of low stringency in packaging for a viral system? it appears that the answer is yes in many cases. many bacteriophages with dna genomes are able to package host or plasmid dna and consequently carry out transduction of host genes  <cit> . low stringency offers the possiblility of the acquisition of host rna transcripts by rna viruses. we have seen that Φ <dig> can acquire plasmid transcripts that do not have pac sequences, albeit at extremely low frequencies  <cit> . it also allows the acquisition of genomic segments of distantly related phages. although Φ <dig> cannot acquire the genomic segments of Φ <dig> a related cystovirus, Φ <dig> can acquire the s and m segments of Φ <dig>  <cit> . influenza virus is now believed to have specific packaging of its genomic segments  <cit> . however the packaging is of low enough stringency that virions can acquire genomic segments from viruses that infect very different host organisms  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the sequences that are necessary for packaging transcripts of the dsrna genome of bacteriophage Φ <dig> are located in the 5' untranslated regions of the three genomic segments. genomic packaging in Φ <dig> is much less stringent than that found for the distantly related bacteriophage Φ <dig>  many changes in the pac region of s are tolerated while others are suppressed by compensating changes in the rna sequence. changes in the packaging program can be produced by mutations that change the amino acid sequence of p <dig>  the major structural protein of the procapsid.
