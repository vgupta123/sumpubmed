BACKGROUND
isothiocyanates  are a group of chemicals that can be generated by certain plants when secondary metabolites called glucosinolates  are degraded by the enzymatic activity of myrosinase. under certain reaction conditions other products such as nitriles and epithionitriles can be produced instead of itcs  <cit> .

the effects of itcs on human and animal cells are well documented such as modulating phase i and phase ii enzymes, the antioxidant capacity, cell cycle and programmed cell death  <cit> . the role of itcs in plant defence against insect pests and plant pathogens has also been extensively studied. itcs have been shown to lead to reduced insect growth and development, as well as reduced offspring  <cit> . they also attract parasitoids of insect pests  <cit> . itcs can lead to reduced bacterial proliferation and fungal growth  <cit> , although the molecular mechanisms leading to these effects are largely unknown.

as itcs are generated upon plant tissue damage such as that occurring during herbivory, itcs might in addition trigger plant defence responses. the effects of itcs on the plants themselves have only been scarcely studied, but have gained more attention lately  <cit> . incorporation into the soil of gsl-producing plant material or pure itcs has been shown to have herbicidal activity  <cit> . application of high doses of itcs directly onto plants has been shown to be phytotoxic while lower doses seem to render the plants more resistant to subsequent heat stress  <cit> . other studies have shown that an itc treatment can lead to the closure of stomata in vitro  <cit> . we have recently started to look at the molecular and cellular effects of itcs in plants  in order to find the molecular mechanisms underlying some of these macroscopic observations.

to lay a basis for further mechanistic investigations we performed a genome scale transcriptional profiling of the arabidopsis thaliana response to an exogenous treatment with allyl-isothiocyanate  at three time points:  <dig> min,  <dig> h and  <dig> h. allyl-isothiocyanate is derived from the glucosinolate sinigrin, which is abundant in black mustard  <cit>  as well as some accessions of the model plant a. thaliana  <cit> . the data illustrates that itc in addition to its known toxic effect at higher doses elicits a complex and dynamic gene response that bears signatures of other abiotic and biotic stress responses. the aim of the present manuscript is to give a general overview of this transcriptional response, discuss in more detail some aspects of the response that we consider particularly interesting and point at some possible directions for further investigations of the effect of isothiocyanates on plant metabolic processes.

RESULTS
extent and dynamics of the transcriptional response to allyl-itc
to analyse the early transcriptional response of arabidopsis thaliana to an exogenous exposure with allyl-isothiocyanate , we performed genome scale transcriptional profiling by microarray at  <dig> min and  <dig> h. in addition, to assess the later a. thaliana response we chose a  <dig> h time point, after having performed pilot studies at different time points. analysis at these three time points shows that the extent of the transcriptional response to the allyl-itc treatment increased with the duration of exposure. indeed, the number of genes whose expression was affected  increased from  <dig> after  <dig> min, to  <dig> after  <dig> h and  <dig> after  <dig> h of exposure to allyl-itc . at all three time points the majority of the affected genes were upregulated:  <dig> at  <dig> min,  <dig> at  <dig> h and  <dig> at  <dig> h. while at the  <dig> min and  <dig> h time points around  <dig> % of the genes were downregulated, the proportion of downregulated genes at  <dig> h decreased to  <dig> %.fig.  <dig> overlap of genes whose expression is affected at the three time points. venn diagrams showing the overlap of  affected  genes between  <dig> min ,  <dig> h  and  <dig> h  in absolute values  and percentages ,  induced genes and  repressed genes



also the overall intensity of the response varied between time points: the log <dig> value of the most upregulated gene increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  to  <dig>  from early to late time points, the log <dig> value of the most downregulated gene went from - <dig>  to - <dig>  to - <dig>  . the maximum absolute values for the mean and median were situated at the  <dig> h time point for upregulated genes but at the  <dig> h and  <dig> min time points respectively for the down regulated genes .table  <dig> intensity of the response to allyl-itc

the values indicate the maximum, mean and median values of the log <dig> ratios of genes affected by allyl-itc compared to the mock treatment



the numbers of genes that were only affected at one of the three time points were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> at  <dig> min,  <dig> h and  <dig> h respectively . this represented less than one third of the total number of affected genes at the two early time points and two thirds at the  <dig> h time point.

early and later responses to allyl-itc exposure differed thus in many of their characteristics. however as can be seen in fig.Â  <dig>   <dig> % of the genes  affected at the earliest time point were also affected at the two later time points . when assessing in more detail the response dynamics of the genes affected at all three time points,  <dig> and  <dig> genes showed a continuous increase in down- and up-regulation from early to late time points  . only  <dig> genes each showed their maximum of respectively down- and up-regulation at the earliest time point . cluster vii was the largest cluster and contained  <dig> genes that were affected at all three time points with the highest induction at the  <dig> h time point .fig.  <dig> dynamics of the allyl-itc response. genes significantly affected by the allyl-itc treatment at all three time points are clustered based on the changes in log <dig> ratios itc/mock between time points. the colour scale goes from blue  to red  and the extremes are set to cover the range of the log <dig> ratios for the most affected genes in the whole dataset



regarding the large number of genes that were affected by the allyl-itc treatment, it is clear that describing all the transcriptional changes is beyond the scope of any article. the analysis of gene ontology  categories overrepresented among the affected genes indicated that a considerable number of different biological processes were affected. interesting patterns were revealed during these analyses, such as for example multiple responses to stress and stimuli, signalling, death and innate immunity for genes upregulated at all three time points . we chose, therefore, a triple approach for this article: 1) relate transcriptional changes to the biosynthetic steps connected to the generation of itcs, 2) show transcriptional changes that might explain effects of itcs on plants that were reported in the literature and 3) present what we consider to be some of the most interesting aspects of this study that incite further investigation.fig.  <dig> go categories overrepresented among genes induced at the three time points. list of gene ontology  categories overrepresented, as identified using bingo  correction; significance level  <dig> ), among the genes that were induced by allyl-itc at all three time points

allyl-itc shows a differential effect on the expression of genes involved in gsl biosynthesis and degradation
considering the fact that isothiocyanates such as allyl-itc are degradation products of glucosinolates , the response of genes involved in their biosynthesis and catabolism is of particular interest. only twelve gsl-biosynthetic genes were significantly affected at the two early time points of  <dig> min and  <dig> h . among them were genes  involved in the biosynthesis of indolic gsls such as cyp81f <dig>  igmt <dig> and related o-methyltransferase  <cit> , which were all upregulated. most of these were also induced at the last time point of  <dig> h. interestingly, the transcription factor myb51/hig <dig>  <cit>  was the only gene of this pathway that was affected more than two-fold after  <dig> min. in addition it was the only member of the myb genes regulating gsl biosynthetic genes that was induced by allyl-itc. indeed the great majority of genes involved in the biosynthesis of aliphatic gsls  and indolic gsls   <cit>  were downregulated, especially at the latest time point . this indicates that the treatment with exogenous itc might have a negative feedback on gsl biosynthesis, although the effect on gsl levels would not be expected to be seen after such a short exposure time. whether this negative feedback is mediated directly by the gsl degradation product itc, due to depletion of glutathione   <cit>  which is the sulphur donor in the biosynthesis of gsl  <cit>  or through a sulphur starvation response  would require further testing. in contrast to the downregulation of most gsl-biosynthetic genes, some of the genes involved in the degradation of gsls were induced after  <dig> h of allyl-itc treatment. although the myrosinases tgg <dig> and tgg <dig> were not affected at the gene expression level, the atypical myrosinase pen <dig> was induced  <cit> . nsp <dig>  one of the nitrile-specifier proteins known to divert gsl hydrolysis from the generation of itcs to that of nitriles  <cit>  was also induced. concomitantly, the expression of the gene encoding epithiospecifier modifier  <dig>  that favours the formation of itcs  <cit>  was reduced. the genes for nitrilases nit <dig> and nit <dig>  which have been shown to act in vitro on several gsl-derived nitriles to generate a carboxylic acid and ammonia  <cit>  and hypothesized to be involved in the endogenous catabolism of gsls  <cit> , were also induced. these gene expression changes indicate that the plant might sense the presence of exogenously applied itc, reduce the biosynthesis of gsls and prevent the generation of endogenous itc from gsl breakdown by favouring the generation of nitriles and their further catabolism by nitrilases. it would therefore be interesting in future experiments to follow the levels of gsls and their degradation products in plants exposed to itc for a longer period of time.fig.  <dig> glucosinolate-related genes affected by allyl-itc. changes in expression levels  of genes involved in the biosynthesis, transport and degradation of glucosinolates after  <dig> min,  <dig> h and  <dig> h of allyl-isothiocyanate treatment, compared to the mock treatment. only values for genes significantly affected at one time point at least are indicated. the colour scale goes from blue  to red  and the extremes are set to cover the range of the log <dig> ratios for the most affected genes in the whole dataset



allyl-itc affects genes involved in glutathione homeostasis
itcs have been shown to conjugate to glutathione  in humans, rats and insects by non-enzymatic or enzymatic processes, the enzymatic conjugation being mediated by glutathione transferases  . studies in various mammalian systems have shown that itcs can lead to an induction of gst gene expression levels and higher gst activities . in our present study, the expression of several gsts was affected by the allyl-itc treatment, the vast majority being induced after  <dig> h of allyl-itc exposure. a detailed description of the effects of allyl-itc on the expression of different gsts will be published elsewhere .

as a conjugation of itcs to gsh has, to our knowledge, not yet been documented in vivo for plants it would be interesting to attempt the detection of gsh-itc and related conjugates in plant tissue. the reversible nature of this conjugation may however complicate the analysis and as this reaction can occur non-enzymatically, the presence of these conjugates would not definitely prove the implication of gsts in this process either.

the expression of dhar <dig>  was also induced by itc. although dhars belong to the gst superfamily, they do not carry out classic gst-type conjugations but reduce dehydroascorbate to ascorbate, concurrently oxidising gsh to glutathione disulphide   <cit> .

if exposure to allyl-itc leads to a conjugation with gsh and/or an oxidation of gsh to gssg as the gene expression patterns might indicate, then levels of gsh would be expected to decrease unless the plant increases gsh biosynthesis and/or reduces gssg to gsh. in a previous study with allyl-itc, we showed that gsh levels decreased to about half after  <dig> h treatment and were maintained for the next two hours of the experiment  <cit> . the increased expression  of the glutathione reductase gr <dig> , responsible for the reduction of gssg to gsh in the cytosol, after  <dig> h of itc treatment in the current experiment might indeed indicate that at least part of the gsh pool is maintained. there was no indication at the transcriptional level of an increased synthesis of gsh as neither gsh <dig>  nor gsh <dig> , encoding the enzymes that catalyse the two steps leading from cysteine to gsh, were induced. however, the fact that total gsh levels can increase without the induction of gsh <dig> and gsh <dig> transcripts under oxidative stress has been reported  <cit> .

also genes encoding enzymes believed to be involved in the processing of gssg and gsh conjugates were affected by allyl-itc treatment. hence the gene encoding the apoplastic Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase ggt <dig>  and the cytosolic phytochelatin synthase pcs <dig>  and Î³-glutamyl cyclotransferase ggct2;  <dig>  were induced more than four-fold at  <dig> h and  <dig> h.

it was also recently shown that exposure to 4-methylsulphinylbutyl-itc  led to a depletion of total glutathione after  <dig> min  <cit> . it would therefore be interesting to complement our previous measurements of gsh during allyl-itc exposure, by following the levels of gssg and total glutathione levels, as well as those of precursors .

allyl-itc effect on genes of sulphate uptake and assimilation
sulphate uptake and assimilation is regulated by many factors  <cit> , such as environmental factors, hormones, the availability of sulphur and the levels of reduced sulphur such as cysteine and glutathione. high levels of gsh are known to repress the expression of genes involved in sulphate uptake and assimilation  <cit> , while sulphur starvation conditions induce their expression .

glucosinolate metabolism is intimately linked to sulphur. the core structure of gsls contains sulphur that is incorporated at two steps during the biosynthesis, via gsh and paps  <cit> . many of the aliphatic gsls also contain a sulphur group in their side chain as this is derived from the sulphur-containing amino acid methionine  <cit> . during the hydrolysis of gsls to generate itcs, sulphate is released  <cit> . the availability of sulphur has been shown to have an effect on the expression of gsl biosynthetic genes and on the content of gsls, especially those derived from methionine  <cit> .

known sulphate starvation-induced genes such as sulphur-deficiency induced sdi <dig>  and sdi <dig> , response to low sulphur lsu <dig> , lsu <dig>  and lsu <dig>  and the Î³-glutamyl cyclotransferase ggct2; <dig>   were among the most highly induced genes after  <dig> min of allyl-itc treatment . therefore, we had a closer look at the effect of allyl-itc on genes involved in sulphate uptake and assimilation.fig.  <dig> effect of allyl-itc on sulphur response. changes in expression levels  of selected sulphur starvation-induced genes and of genes involved in sulphate uptake and assimilation after  <dig> min,  <dig> h and  <dig> h of allyl-itc treatment, compared to mock treatment. only values for genes significantly affected at one time point at least are indicated. the colour scale goes from blue  to red  and the extremes are set to cover the range of the log <dig> ratios for the most affected genes in the whole dataset



several key genes of the sulphate uptake and assimilation pathways were affected by our allyl-itc treatment . the high affinity sulphate transporter sultr1; <dig>   <cit>  was induced after  <dig> h of allyl-itc treatment. also the genes encoding the sulphate transporters sultr4; <dig>  and sultr4; <dig>  that remobilize vacuolar sulphate by mediating its efflux from the vacuole under low sulphur conditions  <cit>  were induced by allyl-itc. interestingly, the coexpressed sultr2; <dig> and sultr5; <dig> believed to interact in retrieving apoplastic sulphate to xylem parenchyma cells and contribute to its root-to-shoot transport  <cit>  were both repressed at the gene level. another major control point of the pathway, besides sulphate transport, is aps reductase which reduces adenosine 5â²-phosphosulphate  to sulphite  <cit> . the genes encoding the three apr isoforms, in particular apr <dig>  and apr <dig> , were induced at all three time points, with a maximum after  <dig> h of allyl-itc treatment. also the genes encoding the atp sulphurylases atps <dig>  and atps <dig>  were induced after  <dig> h and  <dig> h respectively. genes encoding enzymes catalysing the further steps leading from sulphite to cysteine, sulphite reductase and oas thiollyase were not affected by our allyl-itc treatment.fig.  <dig> diagram of the allyl-itc effect on sulphate uptake and assimilation. diagram showing gene expression changes  in the early steps of sulphate uptake and assimilation after  <dig> min,  <dig> h and  <dig> h exposure to allyl-itc. atps: atp sulphurylase, aps: adenosine 5â²-phosphosulphate, paps: 3â²-phosphoadenosine 5â²-phosphosulphate, apk: aps kinase, apr: aps reductase, serat: serine acetyltransferase, oas: o-acetylserine, gsh: glutathione, gsl: glucosinolates



one of the central metabolites in sulphate assimilation is o-acetylserine , which has been proposed to have a signalling function in sulphate starvation  <cit> . oas accumulates during sulphur starvation and the effect of sulphur starvation can be mimicked by oas treatment  <cit> . a. thaliana possesses five genes that encode a plastidic, a mitochondrial and three cytosolic isoforms of serine acetyltransferase , the enzyme that catalyses the synthesis of oas from serine  <cit> . of these five genes, the ones encoding the plastidic serat <dig>   and the cytosolic serat <dig>   isoforms were induced by itc, the former being upregulated at an earlier time point and the latter to a higher extent.

consistent with the downregulation of gsl biosynthetic genes discussed above , the genes encoding the two aps kinases apk <dig>  and apk <dig>  that generate paps  important for the synthesis of sulphated metabolites  <cit> , such as gsls, were down regulated after  <dig> h.

how genes involved in sulphate uptake and assimilation are transcriptionally regulated is less well known. the slim <dig>  transcription factor has been identified as being one of the central regulators of sulphur uptake and assimilation by regulating the expression of several sulphate transporters and other sulphate responsive genes. although it was reported not to be modulated by changes in sulphur conditions  <cit> , slim <dig> was upregulated  after  <dig> h of allyl-itc treatment. similarly, the hy <dig>  transcription factor known to regulate the expression of apr <dig> and apr <dig>  <cit>  was induced  after  <dig> h. also myb transcription factors involved in the regulation of gsls have been reported to regulate the expression of some of the apr, atps and apk-encoding genes  <cit> . as described previously in the text, all the gsl-related mybs were downregulated by allyl-itc, except myb <dig> .

based on the expression profile of sulphate uptake and assimilation genes, one could predict an increased flux through this pathway after itc exposure, leading to increased production of oas and sulphite at the expense of paps and gsl. sulphite is however cytotoxic and very reactive and accumulation of reduced sulphur would exert a different effect on the regulation of sulphate uptake and assimilation than oas. in addition regulation of the pathway at the posttranscriptional and posttranslational levels  <cit>  could change the predicted metabolic outcome. it would therefore be interesting to monitor the cellular levels of some of the compounds  during a prolonged allyl-itc exposure.

whether the effect we see on expression levels of genes regulated by sulphate starvation is mediated directly by sensing the presence of allyl-itc or is an indirect effect due to the demand for reduced sulphur  or another process affecting sulphate assimilation is difficult to assess at this point. one could hypothesize that an excess of gsl hydrolysis products fools the plant to believe that the sulphur-containing gsls are broken down and that it consequently would increase the rate of sulphate assimilation in order to maintain the level of gsls. the observed downregulation of apk-encoding genes, of many gsl biosynthetic genes and related myb transcription factors would however argue against this. in addition, a myrosinase-catalysed hydrolysis of gsls would lead to the release of sulphate, in which case many of the genes that were induced would be expected to be repressed  <cit> .

allyl-itc treatment leads to a heat stress response
heat stress triggers a complex and multifaceted response in plants  <cit> . one of the aspects of this response involves the transcription of genes encoding heat shock proteins  under control of heat shock transcription factors  by their binding to heat stress promoter elements  <cit> . numerous genes encoding hsfs and hsps were among the most highly induced genes after  <dig> h and  <dig> h of allyl-itc treatment . nine of the ten most highly induced genes at  <dig> h were hsfs or hsps .fig.  <dig> heat stress response after allyl-itc treatment. changes in expression levels  of genes involved in the heat stress response after  <dig> min,  <dig> h and  <dig> h of allyl-isothiocyanate treatment, compared to mock treatment. only values for genes significantly affected at one time point at least are indicated. the colour scale goes from blue  to red  and the extremes are set to cover the range of the log <dig> ratios for the most affected genes in the whole dataset



the expression of thirteen of the twenty-one known a. thaliana hsfs  <cit>  was affected by the allyl-itc treatment at one time point at least. hsfa <dig>  was the earliest and most highly induced hsf throughout the experiment, interestingly showing an induction above log <dig> =  <dig> already after  <dig> min and close to log <dig> =  <dig>  at the  <dig> h time point. hsfa <dig> plays a central role in the heat stress response and thermotolerance but is also a key regulator of the plant response to several other abiotic stresses  <cit> . hsfa <dig> regulates the expression of several target genes, including various shsps  affected in our experiment. it is itself regulated by hsfa1d  and/or hsfa1e , which belong to the a <dig> class hsfs considered as being the master regulators of the heat stress response . hsfa1d/hsfa1e control the expression of other hsfs such as hsfa7a , hsfa7b , hsfb <dig>  and hsfb2a   <cit> . upon allyl-itc treatment, the transcriptional activation of hsfa <dig> occurs however earlier than that of hsfa1d and hsfa1e, and also hsfa7a, hsfa7b, hsfb <dig> and hsfb2a showed a higher induction by allyl-itc at the  <dig> h time point than hsfa1d/hsfa1e. allyl-itc also induced hsfb2b , another member of the class b hsfs, at the  <dig> h and  <dig> h time points. hsfb <dig> and hsfb2b are rapidly induced by heat stress and have been shown to negatively regulate the expression of heat stress induced hsfs and hsps and of defence related genes  <cit> . hsfa7a is important for heat acclimation  <cit> , and hsfa7a is induced prior to hsfa <dig> upon heat stress  <cit> . the opposite was observed under allyl-itc treatment. both members of the hsfa <dig> class, hsfa4a  and hsfa4c , were induced by allyl-itc but to a lesser extent than most other hsfs. also, hsfa4a  was induced earlier and stronger than hsfa4c . it has been shown that both act as activators of heat stress gene expression  <cit>  and in the case of hsfa <dig> also of oxidative stress responsive genes  <cit> . hsfa <dig>  was only induced at the  <dig> h time point. little is known about this hsf but its expression is induced by hsfa <dig> overexpression  <cit>  and it has recently been characterized as a redox-sensitive transcription factor that translocates to the nucleus upon oxidative stress  <cit> .

two points should be pointed out regarding allyl-itc treatment and the heat stress response. first, hsfa <dig>  whose expression is heat stress induced, is dependent on dreb2a and dreb2c and triggers the induction of other heat stress related genes  <cit> , was not affected by allyl-itc treatment at any of the three time points whereas dreb2a  and dreb2c  were induced .

second, only the two hsfs hsfa <dig>  and hsfc <dig>  were downregulated by an exposure to allyl-itc. interestingly, these two genes are under positive regulation of the transcription factor nac <dig> , which is induced by heat stress  <cit>  but repressed by allyl-itc .

although small heat shock proteins  are also induced by other abiotic stresses, it was proposed that shsps protect thermo-sensitive substrates from irreversible heat stress-induced denaturation and aggregation  <cit> . of the  <dig> known a. thaliana genes encoding shsps,  <dig> were induced after  <dig> h and  <dig> h of allyl-itc treatment, with invariably a higher induction at  <dig> h . this mimics the unequivocal transcriptional response of these hsps to heat stress conditions  <cit> .

it has been recently shown that the expression of hsp70- <dig> , hsp70- <dig>  and hsp70- <dig>  was transiently increased, with a maximum at  <dig> h after treatment, when  <dig> day old plants were sprayed with a  <dig> mm phenethyl-itc solution and monitored for  <dig> h  <cit> . we confirm that of the  <dig> a. thaliana hsp70-encoding genes  <cit>  these three genes were the most highly induced by our allyl-itc treatment, but an additional nine hsp70s were revealed to be upregulated . also, all affected hsp70s were more highly induced after  <dig> h than after  <dig> h in our study. hsp70s are atp-dependent chaperones involved in processes such as folding of de novo synthesized proteins and refolding of misfolded proteins and aggregated proteins  <cit> , although the role of many of them in a. thaliana is still unclear. j-domain containing proteins  are cochaperones of hsp70s  <cit> . more than  <dig> genes encoding dnaj proteins have been identified in a. thaliana  <cit>  and eighteen of these were induced to various degrees by allyl-itc . the reason for this and its biological significance are not known. for those dnaj genes that were affected at two time points, the induction was higher after  <dig> h of allyl-itc treatment than after  <dig> h, similar to the situation observed for shsps and hsp70s .

another family of hsps are the hsp90s that exert their chaperone activity on a select number of client proteins involved in the heat stress response but also hormone signalling and developmental processes . they have also been implicated in plant defence by regulating the activity of several so-called r  proteins through complex formation . four hsp90s were induced by allyl-itc, with the gene at5g <dig> encoding the cytosolic hsp <dig>  being most highly induced . hsp <dig>  expression is induced by heat stress and it physically interacts with hsfa <dig>  <cit> . but hsp <dig>  expression is also induced after pathogen challenge, interacts with disease resistance signalling components and is required for resistance mediated by rps <dig> and cell death during the hypersensitive response   <cit> . the hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> chaperone machineries are connected via the tetratricopeptide repeat -containing sti1/hop protein, which binds to both hsps and allows the transfer of the client protein from hsp <dig> to hsp <dig>  <cit> . although we are not aware of this having been described in plants, the heat induced genes hop <dig>  and hop <dig>  encoding tpr-containing proteins  <cit>  were induced by allyl-itc .

three members of the heat shock protein  <dig> /casein lytic proteinase  subclass b  <cit>  were induced by allyl-itc: hsp101/clpb <dig> , clpb <dig>  and clpb <dig>  . all three are induced by heat stress and the important role of hsp <dig> in thermotolerance is well documented . hsp <dig> is hypothesized to act in a positive feedback loop with hsa <dig>  in the memory of heat acclimation  <cit> , a gene that was also induced by allyl-itc after  <dig> h and  <dig> h.

the massive hsf-controlled induction of hsps, which act as molecular chaperones to protect proteins against denaturation and to facilitate refolding, is one aspect of the heat stress response in plants. but also other factors are involved in the protection against heat-induced damage and different signalling pathways such as abscisic acid , salicylic acid , ethylene and oxidative burst seem to be involved in thermotolerance  <cit> .

mbf1c , one of the three genes encoding the highly conserved transcriptional co-activator mbf <dig>  in a. thaliana, is induced by several stresses such as pathogen infection, salinity, drought, hydrogen peroxide , and application of the plant hormones aba or sa. it has also been identified as key regulator of thermotolerance that functions upstream of  ethylene during heat stress  <cit> . mbf1c was highly upregulated by  <dig> h and  <dig> h  of allyl-itc treatment , whereas its interaction partner tps <dig> , also a heat-induced gene, was not induced by allyl-itc. of the ten other genes encoding tps-like or active tps , nine were either downregulated or not affected by allyl-itc and only tps <dig>  was induced after  <dig> h. interestingly, overall only half  of the genes that showed an elevated expression in plants constitutively expressing mbf1c and grown under control conditions  <cit>  were also induced at  <dig> h of allyl-itc treatment. however, all eight of the ethylene-associated transcripts, comprising seven ethylene response factors  and acc synthase  <dig>  were induced by allyl-itc . this might indicate that the allyl-itc-triggered heat stress response via mbf1c involves ethylene but not trehalose. among the genes whose induction under heat stress was dependent on mbf1c  <cit>  it is interesting to note that the two heat shock transcription factors hsfb2a  and hsfb2b , the transcriptional regulator dreb2a/erf <dig>  and four zinc finger protein genes were also induced by itc after  <dig> h .

the expression of several other genes reported to be involved in the heat stress response was also affected by allyl-itc treatment, some of which will be discussed shortly below. the gene encoding the bcl-2âassociated athanogene  protein bag <dig> , belonging to a family of chaperone regulators that interact with hsp <dig> and hsc <dig>  proteins, was rapidly and strongly induced by allyl-itc treatment, with the highest induction after  <dig> h, similar to its responsiveness to heat  <cit> . bag <dig> was also identified as a target gene of hsfa <dig>  <cit> . galactinol synthase  <dig>  which is implicated in raffinose synthesis under heat stress and whose expression is controlled by hsfa1b and hsfa <dig>  <cit> , was induced by allyl-itc treatment at  <dig> h and  <dig> h. at3g <dig> coding for atfes1a, a heat induced protein that associates with hsp <dig> and prevents its degradation  <cit> , was induced at  <dig> h and  <dig> h by allyl-itc. the genes encoding the prolyl cis-trans isomerase cochaperones rof <dig>  and rof <dig>  were also induced at  <dig> h and  <dig> h of allyl-itc treatment. rof <dig> is heat stress induced, binds hsp <dig>  and affects the accumulation of hsfa2-regulated shsps  <cit> . deg14/park <dig>  was the only member of the deg/htra  protease family involved in protein quality control  <cit>  that was upregulated by allyl-itc. deg14/park <dig> is heat stress-induced, and confers thermotolerance by degrading misfolded protein targets  <cit> . the heat-induced gene at5g <dig> encoding the noncanonical small heat shock protein bobber  <dig>  required for thermotolerance and the duplicated gene bob <dig>  were induced by allyl-itc at  <dig> h and  <dig> h  <cit> . til <dig> , another gene required for thermotolerance  <cit> , was induced at  <dig> h and  <dig> h. four of the five heat-inducible tas1-derived sirna mediated target genes  <cit>  were induced by allyl-itc: htt <dig> , htt <dig> , htt <dig>  and htt <dig> . htt <dig> and htt <dig> are probably direct targets of hsfa1a and hsfa1b  <cit> . as mentioned above, hsfa1a and hsfa1b were not induced by allyl-itc, but these hsfs can on their turn positively regulate the expression of several other hsfs   <cit> , most of which were induced by allyl-itc.

based on our transcriptional profiling results, exposure to allyl-itc seems to trigger a heat stress response in a. thaliana. itcs do not only seem to lead to a heat stress response in plants as it has been shown that 4-methylsulphinylbutyl-itc  activates a heat shock response in animal cells  <cit> . treatment with phenethyl-itc led to an increased thermotolerance in a. thaliana  <cit> , although the pathways through which this was mediated are not yet known. based on a recently proposed model integrating h2o <dig>  nitric oxide  and calmodulin in the heat stress response  <cit> , itc-triggered h2o <dig> might signal no formation that leads to calmodulin  <dig>  activation, stimulating the dna-binding activity of hsfs and the accumulation of hsps. it has indeed been shown that itc treatment triggers the production of reactive oxygen species  and no in plants  <cit> . our transcriptional data however does not give clear support for the itc-induced heat stress response acting through that model. the key component cam <dig> was only slightly  induced by allyl-itc at the two latest time points, although cam <dig> and other calmodulin like  genes were induced . the gene at1g <dig> encoding the major nitrate reductase isoform nia <dig> leading to no production was not affected and nia <dig>  was slightly  induced by allyl-itc at  <dig> min but downregulated at the later time points. also noa <dig> , which affects no accumulation, was not affected by allyl-itc. nevertheless it would be interesting to test this and other possible signalling pathways. hence we are currently investigating 1) the effect of allyl-itc on a. thaliana mutants known to have reduced thermotolerance in order to identify the underlying mechanisms and 2) the thermotolerance of loss of function mutants in genes induced by allyl-itc to identify potentially new actors regulating the plant response to heat stress.

the extent of overlap in the transcriptional response to allyl-itc and oxidative stress
treatment with itcs has been reported to lead to the generation of ros and no  <cit> . heat stress also triggers the generation of ros and, as mentioned above, ros are implicated in the heat stress response  <cit> . hsfs have been proposed as h2o <dig> sensors in plants and recently hsfa4a and hsfa <dig> have been described as redox-sensitive transcription factors  <cit> . part of the heat stress response detected upon allyl-itc treatment as described in the previous paragraph may therefore be due to the generation of ros. we analysed our microarray data after allyl-itc treatment in the search of a ros response/oxidative burst response by comparing it to some previously reported transcriptional profiling studies where ros-generating treatments were used.

of the  <dig> genes induced by at least log <dig> =  <dig> during the first two hours under singlet oxygen-producing conditions reported by op den camp et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> %  were also upregulated by allyl-itc at one of the three time points . of the  <dig> singlet oxygen-downregulated genes,  <dig> genes  were also downregulated by allyl-itc . when doing a similar comparison with the  <dig> genes induced by superoxide/h2o <dig> detected in the same study  <cit> ,  <dig> %  were also induced by allyl-itc at one of the three time points. only  <dig> genes were downregulated by superoxide/h2o <dig> and only  <dig> of these  were also repressed by allyl-itc. ninety-one and three genes were respectively induced or repressed by all three treatments. genes that were either induced or repressed by allyl-itc only, were  <dig> and  <dig> .fig.  <dig> overlap between responses to allyl-itc and singlet oxygen or h2o2/superoxide. venn diagrams showing the overlap between singlet oxygen  or h2o2/superoxide-affected  genes  <cit>  and allyl-itc-affected . genes in  were induced by log <dig> â¥  <dig> while genes in  were repressed by log <dig> â¤ - <dig> at one time point at least



gadjev et al.  <cit>  identified five transcripts considered to be hallmarks for the general oxidative stress response regardless of the type of ros. at2g <dig>  encoding a defensin-like protein was slightly downregulated at  <dig> h and  <dig> h of allyl-itc treatment . at2g <dig> and at1g <dig>  encoding proteins of unknown function, were induced after  <dig> h of allyl-itc treatment. the two remaining hallmark genes, at1g <dig> encoding a tir-nb-lrr protein and the uncharacterized at1g <dig>  responded earlier and stronger to allyl-itc .

another  <dig> genes responding to a general oxidative stress were identified using a lower stringency  <cit> . of these,  <dig> were induced by allyl-itc and include heat stress associated genes , gsts and other stress associated genes .

genes serving as hallmarks for specific oxidative stress conditions previously identified  <cit>  were also used to compare to the allyl-itc response. of the  <dig> transcripts that are specifically singlet oxygen responsive , only  <dig> showed the same response to the allyl-itc treatment  . the overlap between specifically superoxide-responsive genes and those affected by allyl-itc was even smaller: of  <dig> and  <dig> genes respectively up- and down-regulated specifically by superoxide, only  <dig> and  <dig> genes showed the same response to allyl-itc. the overlap in genes differentially regulated by the two conditions was actually bigger . of the  <dig> transcripts specific to the hydrogen peroxide response ,  <dig> were equally affected by the allyl-itc treatment  . the numbers of genes differentially regulated by the two conditions were almost as high:  <dig> genes upregulated by h2o <dig> but downregulated by allyl-itc,  <dig> genes downregulated by h2o <dig> but upregulated by allyl-itc .

from these analyses, it seems clear to us that the transcriptional response to allyl-itc cannot just be explained by itc causing an oxidative burst. we identified a certain overlap between the allyl-itc and oxidative stress responses, but this cannot be attributed to one particular ros or oxidative stress condition. ros production can occur at multiple locations in plant cells, such as chloroplasts, peroxisomes, mitochondria and on the outer surface of the plasma membrane. such an extracellular burst of superoxide resulting from nadph oxidase activity and the subsequent production of h2o <dig> are key features of the plant defence response  <cit> . as gsl degradation products have well established roles in plant resistance, we analysed in more detail the allyl-itc response in this respect in the next paragraph.

allyl-itc and the perception of elicitors and effectors
pattern recognition receptors  at the plant cell surface can perceive the presence of pathogens by sensing pathogen/microbe-associated molecular patterns  and signals originating from the damaged plant . recognition of pamps or damps triggers a cascade of events, called pamp-triggered immunity , which includes ion fluxes across the plasma membrane, generation of ros, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases  and transcriptional activation of genes. successful pathogens can suppress pti by excreting so-called effectors into the plant cell. when these effectors are perceived, typically by intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat  proteins, the effector-triggered immunity  response, which is often accompanied by the so-called hypersensitive response characterized by rapid cell death, is triggered and leads to plant resistance  <cit> .

prrs can be divided into receptor-like kinases , with an extracellular ligand-binding domain and an intracellular kinase domain, and receptor-like proteins  that lack an intracellular kinase domain. the ectodomains can be of various types , lysine motifs , lectin domain) and the a. thaliana genome contains several hundreds of genes encoding rlks and rlps that could putatively be involved in plant defence as prrs, but only a few have been characterized so far  <cit> .

rlks and rlps were not among the most highly responsive genes upon allyl-itc exposure. however several interesting responses were observed  that might point towards the role of allyl-itc acting as damp or triggering the generation of damps. the lrr-rlks bak1/serk <dig>  and bkk1/serk <dig>  that cooperate in pamp and damp signalling  <cit>  were induced by allyl-itc . also pepr <dig>  and pepr <dig>  encoding lrr-rlks that are the receptors of the elicitor active small atpep peptides  <cit>  were induced by allyl-itc, in addition to the atpep <dig> precursor gene propep <dig>  and two of its paralogs   <cit> . several other lrr-rlk-encoding genes were induced by allyl-itc treatment at the different time points, but the roles of these have not been described yet. of particular interest for further studies might be frk <dig>  and at1g <dig> that were transiently induced at  <dig> min before being repressed at the later time points, or at5g <dig> and at1g <dig> which were among the most highly induced lrr-rlks. the three genes encoding the lysm-rlks lyk <dig> , lyk <dig>  and cerk <dig> , all involved in the recognition of the fungal cell wall pamp chitin during plant innate immunity , were induced by allyl-itc. waks  and wakls  are rlks whose ectodomain contains epidermal growth factor-like repeats. wak <dig> was identified as a receptor of oligogalacturonides , a damp generated from the plant cell wall polysaccharide homogalacturonan  <cit> . nine of the  <dig> wak/wakl members were affected by allyl-itc, in particular wakl <dig>  and wakl <dig>  .fig.  <dig> effect of allyl-itc on the expression of rlks and rlps. changes in expression levels  of selected rlks and rlps after  <dig> min,  <dig> h and  <dig> h of allyl-isothiocyanate treatment, compared to mock treatment. only values for genes significantly affected at one time point at least are indicated. the colour scale goes from blue  to red  and the extremes are set to cover the range of the log <dig> ratios for the most affected genes in the whole dataset



lectin receptor kinases are another group of rlks implicated in plant innate immunity  <cit> . genes encoding the l-type lectin receptor kinases lecrk-iv. <dig>  and lecrk-vi. <dig>  were the lecrk genes most highly induced by allyl-itc at  <dig> min and both lecrk are involved in pathogen resistance  <cit> . the g-type at4g <dig> and l-type at4g <dig>  were the most highly induced lecrks at  <dig> h and  <dig> h. although the roles of most of the allyl-itc induced lectin receptor kinases have not yet been revealed, many lecrks have been shown to be particularly responsive to pathogens and pamps  <cit> .

receptor-like proteins  have also been found to play a role in disease resistance  <cit> . several rlp-encoding genes responded to allyl-itc, the most highly induced being presented in fig.Â  <dig>  the lrr-rlps members rlp <dig>  and rlp <dig>  are involved in resistance to fungal pathogens  <cit> . remax/rlp <dig> , with specificity for the bacterial proteinaceous mamp emax  <cit> , was rapidly induced by allyl-itc. other, so far uncharacterized, rlps showing an early response  and a strong response  to allyl-itc constitute interesting candidates for further studies.

nb-lrrs, acting in eti that limits the proliferation of pathogens, constitute the major class of so-called r  proteins  <cit> . they are highly polymorphic and are classified based on the domains they contain  <cit> .

tir-nb-lrr proteins contain an n-terminal toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor homology region. thirty-nine of the  <dig> tir-nb-lrr-encoding genes identified by meyers et al.  <cit>  were affected by allyl-itc treatment at one time point at least . two of these were downregulated at the  <dig> h time point: at1g <dig> which was implicated in resistance to blackleg disease  <cit>  and the uncharacterized at5g <dig>  of the thirty-seven upregulated genes a large majority of  <dig> was induced highest at the  <dig> h time point while the remaining nine genes were most induced at the  <dig> h time point. among these allyl-itc responsive genes were some characterized resistance genes such as rpp <dig> , rpp <dig> , rps <dig> , wrr4/adr <dig>  , although they were not the most highly induced tir-nb-lrr. the functions of most of the tir-nb-lrr have however not been revealed yet. hence, the most interesting tir-nb-lrr-encoding genes in our dataset may be the still uncharacterized genes that were rapidly induced by allyl-itc  and those that were highly induced on at least two of the time points  .fig.  <dig> effect of allyl-itc on the expression of nb-lrrs. changes in expression levels  of nb-lrr-encoding genes after  <dig> min,  <dig> h and  <dig> h of allyl-itc treatment, compared to mock treatment. the given nb-lrr subgroups are according to meyers et al.  <cit> . only values for genes significantly affected at one time point at least are indicated. the colour scale goes from blue  to red  and the extremes are set to cover the range of the log <dig> ratios for the most affected genes in the whole dataset



also eight genes classified as coding for tns, tir-nb proteins lacking a lrr domain  <cit> , were affected by our allyl-itc treatment. the genes at1g <dig>  and at1g <dig>  were induced at all three time points. attn <dig> was the nb-lrr gene that showed the highest induction at each time point  and was overall amongst the top-induced genes . the specific functions of these two tns have not been characterized yet but a role in plant defence has been postulated. they are induced by abiotic and biotic stresses, their transient expression leads to an eds <dig> -dependent hr cell death and they are able to interact with elicitors  <cit> . they constitute therefore interesting candidates to investigate further for their role in the allyl-itc response.

of the  <dig> tx genes encoding proteins with a tir domain but no lrr or nb domains  <cit> , four were affected by the allyl-itc treatment at any time point: at5g <dig>  was downregulated at  <dig> min; at5g <dig>  is upregulated at  <dig> min; while the two closely related at1g <dig>  and at2g <dig>  were upregulated at  <dig> h and  <dig> h. although the specific functions of tx proteins are not yet known, their role in basal resistance has been recently investigated  <cit> . in particular, overexpression of at2g <dig>  leads to activated expression of defence-related genes and an eds1-dependent dwarf phenotype  <cit> .

most nb-lrr proteins that do not contain a tir domain contain an n-terminal cc  domain. of the  <dig> genes encoding cc-nb-lrr proteins  <cit> ,  <dig> genes were moderately upregulated by the allyl-itc treatment at one time point at least . these include the characterized resistance genes adr <dig> , adr1-l <dig> , rps <dig>  and zar <dig>  .

interestingly, some known r genes and plant defence-related genes were not affected by the allyl itc treatment. for example the two r genes rpm <dig> , encoding a cc-nbs-lrr, and rps <dig> , encoding a tir-nb-lrr, signalling respectively through ndr <dig>  and eds <dig> were not significantly affected  <cit> . of these two major components in r gene-dependent defence activation eds <dig>  was induced at  <dig> h while ndr <dig>  was not affected by the allyl-itc treatment . some, but not all, nb-lrrâmediated eti responses require accumulation of sa, which in turn controls transcriptional reprogramming through npr <dig> . however npr <dig> was not induced in our dataset. also the pathogen stress and sa signalling pathway markers pr <dig>  and pr <dig> , and the plant defensins pdf <dig> a  and pdf <dig> b  were not affected by the allyl-itc treatment.

go-category analysis  and the transcriptional changes of many defence-related genes  such as the rlks and rlps described here, indicate that allyl-itc triggers an immune response. the mechanisms remain unknown and the possibility that gsl-degradation products - allyl-itc in the present case - might trigger this response by being perceived as damps by a receptor, such as one of those described above, either directly or indirectly constitutes an interesting aspect worthy of further investigations. it could indeed be conceived that itcs induce a receptor triggered response by changing the conformation of the receptor or that of a protein interacting with the receptor protein in question . in animal systems itcs have been shown to target proteins, triggering conformational changes and/or activation  <cit> . alternatively, receptor protein could be activated by itc-induced physiological changes by analogy to the mammalian nlrp <dig> receptor that is activated by various danger signals   <cit> .

allyl-itc and the triggering of cell death mechanisms
as mentioned above, programmed cell death  is a characteristic of the hypersensitive response  during eti. a recent study reported that the 4-methylsulphinylbutyl-itc  could induce pcd during hr  <cit> . the pcd during hr is characterized as ânon-autolyticâ and is often shown to be preceded by influx of calcium into the cytoplasm, activation of a mapk signalling cascades, production of reactive oxygen intermediates and nitric oxide, and biosynthesis of sa  <cit> . pcd can also be mediated by the so-called er stress which is due to the accumulation of un/misfolded proteins in the er  <cit> . our dataset revealed an overrepresentation of genes associated with cell death amongst those induced by allyl-itc , although the way gene expression was changed was not always in the sense of cell death promotion. interestingly, it has recently been shown that the indole-gsl breakdown products indole-3-acetonitrile  and indole-3-carbinol , although not structurally related to itcs, are able to attenuate pcd induced by the mycotoxin fumonisin b <dig>  <cit> .

as described above, several tir-nb-lrr-encoding genes were induced by the allyl-itc treatment. also three genes that form a signalling module integrating redox signals in a chain of events leading to pcd mediated by tir-nb-lrr receptors  <cit> , namely eds <dig> , pad <dig>  and sag <dig> , were induced at  <dig> h . it has also been shown that eds1-dependent cell death can be induced when some, but not all, tn proteins, tx proteins or the tir domain of tir-nb-lrr proteins are transiently expressed  <cit> . of the five tn/txs showing this effect  <cit> , three had increased gene expression after allyl-itc treatment: at1g <dig> , at1g <dig>  and at1g <dig>  .fig.  <dig> cell death-related genes affected by allyl-itc. changes in expression levels  of genes involved in cell death mechanisms after  <dig> min,  <dig> h and  <dig> h of allyl-itc treatment, compared to mock treatment. only values for genes significantly affected at one time point at least are indicated. the colour scale goes from blue  to red  and the extremes are set to cover the range of the log <dig> ratios for the most affected genes in the whole dataset. genes are listed in the order they are described in the text



among cc-nb-lrr-encoding genes that were induced by allyl-itc , adr <dig>  and atnrg <dig>  , have been shown to induce hr as part of a defence response when their atypical cc-domains  were transiently expressed  <cit> . it was speculated that they might sense indirect cellular insults or act downstream of canonical nb-lrr proteins in disease resistance  <cit> . such a role as âhelper nb-lrrsâ was verified for three adr <dig> family members, and the triple mutant exhibited compromised hr  <cit> .

the three general repressors of cell death bap <dig> , bap <dig>  and their interaction partner bon <dig>  are induced by the allyl-itc treatment . it has previously been shown that bap transcripts are induced by a number of biotic and abiotic stimuli and that overexpression of bap <dig> and bon <dig> delays hr induced by two avirulent strains of the bacterium pseudomonas syringae and cell death induced by the ros-generating herbicide paraquat  <cit> .

also mlo <dig> , which belongs to the mildew resistance locus o family of negative regulators of cell death  <cit> , was induced at  <dig> h and  <dig> h.

overexpression of plant cell death suppressor bi- <dig>  proteins has shown to suppress cell death induced by a variety of factors: mammalian bax , pathogen attack, abiotic stresses, chemically-induced oxidative stresses  <cit> . atbi- <dig>   and the three closely related genes encoding lfg <dig> , lfg <dig>  and lfg <dig> , belonging to the bax inhibitor- <dig> family and possibly inhibiting cell death  <cit> , were all highly induced at  <dig> h and  <dig> h. homologues of the mammalian pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins bax and bcl- <dig>  respectively, have not yet been identified in plants. however, seven homologues of mammalian bcl-2âassociated athanogene  proteins, cytoprotective proteins acting as chaperone regulators that interact with hsp <dig> and hsc <dig> proteins, have been described for a. thaliana  <cit> . allyl-itc treatment for  <dig> h and  <dig> h induces the expression of genes encoding bag <dig>  and bag <dig> . bag  <dig> was among the top  <dig> allyl-itc induced genes at the  <dig> h time point . both proteins contain in addition to the bag domain  a calmodulin-binding motif, a special feature of some plant bag proteins  <cit> . bag <dig> was characterized as a stress  responsive protein that is able to bind calmodulins  but not athsc70- <dig> in vitro and that, unexpectedly, induces pcd  <cit> . another report however postulated that bag <dig> has a cytoprotective role, promotes basal resistance to the necrotrophic fungus botrytis cinerea and retards plant senescence  <cit> . except for the finding that bag <dig>  was able to bind athsc70- <dig> in vitro  <cit> , little is known about the role of this bag family member in plants.

other actors with potential cell death regulatory function are metacaspases , and a. thaliana possesses nine mc-encoding genes  <cit> . the expression of atmc <dig>  and atmc <dig> , coding for two metacaspases that have antagonistic functions in regulating hr-associated cell death  <cit> , responded differently to the allyl-itc treatment. while the positive regulator of cell death atmc <dig> was induced, the negative regulator of cell death atmc <dig> was repressed at the last time point tested. in addition, the gene encoding lsd <dig> , which is a negative cell death regulator and interacts with atmc <dig>  <cit> , was upregulated at the  <dig> h time point. on the other hand, lol <dig> , with homology to lsd <dig> and considered a positive regulator of cell death  <cit> , was downregulated. another metacaspase, the positive regulator of oxidative stress-induced cell death atmc <dig>  was induced at all three time points, particularly at  <dig> h and  <dig> h. the yet uncharacterized atmc <dig>  was downregulated at the  <dig> min time point. interestingly, atmc <dig> , a positive regulator that contributes to cell death activation during oxidative stress and hostâpathogen defence responses  <cit>  was not significantly affected by allyl-itc. it should be noted that post-translational control mechanisms and protein-protein interactions have been described to affect metacaspases  <cit>  and our transcriptional profiling may hence not give the whole picture of how allyl-itc affects metacaspases during its putative induction of cell death.

several adverse biotic and abiotic environmental factors can lead to endoplasmic reticulum  stress as the capacity of the protein folding and er-associated degradation  machinery is exceeded. this triggers a stress mitigation mechanism called unfolded protein response . er stress sensors located on the er membrane initiate the upr signalling pathway that can ultimately lead to pcd. two branches of the upr signalling pathway have been identified in plants so far: the ire and the bzip28/bzip <dig>   <cit> .

plant ire1s  are localized to the er membrane, possess kinase and endoribonuclease domains, and in response to er stress ire <dig> splices the mrna encoding bzip <dig>  <cit> . although neither ire1-1/ire1b  nor ire1-2/ire1a  were affected by allyl-itc, bzip <dig>  was induced at  <dig> h and  <dig> h . the spliced bzip <dig> mrna is translated, the protein translocates to the nucleus and activates directly upr genes such as genes encoding chaperones of the hsp <dig> family called bips . bip <dig> , bip <dig>  and bip <dig>  were induced at  <dig> h allyl-itc treatment . bzip <dig> also activates the transcription factors nac <dig> , induced by allyl-itc, and nac <dig>  which then activate upr genes such as cnx <dig> , crt <dig>  and pdi <dig>   <cit> . the other pathway is mediated by bzip <dig> and bzip <dig> that are also localized to the er membrane under normal conditions  <cit> . while bzip <dig>  was induced after  <dig> h and  <dig> h of allyl-itc exposure, bzip <dig>  was not affected. upon er stress, they are transported to the golgi where they are proteolytically cleaved and then translocate to the nucleus, where they induce upr genes. bzip <dig> forms a transcriptional complex with a nf-ya4/nf-yb3/nf-yc <dig>  trimer, leading to the induction of genes like bip <dig>  sdf <dig> , cnx <dig>  pdi <dig> and nf-yc <dig>  <cit> . nf-yc <dig>  was upregulated at  <dig> h; nf-yb <dig>  was downregulated at  <dig> h while the expression of nf-ya <dig>  was not affected by the allyl-itc treatment. also other markers for er stress and upr were not induced such as cnx <dig> , atcrt <dig> , sdf <dig> , nac <dig>  transcription factor  <cit>  or any of the six pdi genes induced by chemical er stress inducers  <cit> .

however genes reported to be induced by tunicamycin, a typical er stress agent that elicits upr, were also induced by allyl-itc, such as tin <dig> , djb9/tms <dig> , hsp70- <dig>  and the already mentioned atbi- <dig>   . the allyl-itc treatment also lead to the downregulation of genes  that were reported to be downregulated by tunicamycin, such as the cell death antagonist kti <dig>   <cit> , pr <dig> , per <dig>  and osm <dig>  .

based on these expression profiles, it is possible that itcs trigger an er stress and an upr response, leading ultimately to pcd. as different environmental conditions and chemical compounds can lead to er stress, it is however difficult to pinpoint at how itc might trigger er stress. as discussed previously, itcs might either directly affect the folding of proteins or might through the depletion of gsh affect the oxidizing status of the er and hence the disulphide bond formation involved in protein folding. itc might also lead to er stress by triggering an oxidative stress. hence, the action of allyl-itc through this pathway is worth being further investigated, e.g. by using chemical chaperones in conjunction with allyl-itc to reduce the load of misfolded proteins in the er. also, as it was shown that sulforaphane and benzyl-itc, but not isopropyl-itc, led to cell death  <cit> , a larger range of itcs should be tested. cell death triggered by sulforaphane was observable  <dig> h after infiltration  <cit> . most of the er stress and upr genes that responded to our allyl-itc treatment were affected at the latest  time point that we assessed. it would therefore be interesting to see if other hallmarks of this pathway can be detected after a longer exposure to allyl-itc.

due to the spatial separation of gsls and myrosinases in the intact plant cell  <cit>  endogenous itc generated upon cell rupture and exogenously applied itc might be expected to act to a great degree in the apoplast and cytosol. plants possess a mechanism to sense misfolded proteins in the cytosol, the so-called cytosolic protein response . upon stress-triggered accumulation of misfolded proteins in the cytosol, hsp70/hsp <dig> chaperones are recruited. this disturbs the interaction between hsps and hsfs that is responsible for maintaining protein homeostasis. the released hsfs trimerize to form active transcription factor complexes that get imported into the nucleus and activate the transcription of hsps. upon restoration of normal levels of free chaperones, hsfs are inactivated by binding of the hsp <dig> machinery  <cit> . hence, the cpr is a subcomponent of the wider heat shock response already discussed earlier in this article. when comparing transcriptional features attributed to cpr  <cit>  with the transcriptional response to allyl-itc, a large overlap was detected within the induced response: of the  <dig> upregulated genes of the cpr,  <dig> genes were induced by allyl-itc after  <dig> h and  <dig> genes were induced by allyl-itc after  <dig> h . many hsps and hsfs, including hsfa <dig> that was identified as one of the regulatory components of cpr in a. thaliana  <cit> , were induced in the cpr and by allyl-itc. the list contains also many genes encoding other transcription factors and genes encoding proteins involved in protein degradation. the overlap in downregulated genes between the two conditions is much more restricted: of the  <dig> cpr-repressed genes,  <dig> and  <dig> were downregulated by allyl-itc at  <dig> h and  <dig> h respectively . interestingly however, eight of these  <dig> genes are known to be induced by auxin, and include genes such as iaa1/axr <dig> , acs <dig> ; the homeobox-leucine zipper hat <dig>  and three saur  genes . it might be that allyl-itc exerts an auxin-antagonistic action, as has recently been shown for indole-3-carbinol  <cit> , a degradation product of indole-3-methyl-gsl. also other signalling molecules such as oligogalacturonides  have been reported to inhibit the induction of certain auxin responsive genes  <cit> . another possible explanation might be that the allyl-itc-triggered production of h2o <dig> suppresses the activation of auxin-inducible genes  <cit> . in this context it is noteworthy that one of the few saur genes induced by allyl-itc, saur <dig> , was also induced during the cpr  <cit> .

characteristic features of the cytosolic protein response at the transcriptional level are hence part of the larger allyl-itc response. the mechanism through which allyl-itc triggers this response and its outcome seem therefore to be interesting aspects deserving further investigations.

CONCLUSIONS
exposure of arabidopsis thaliana to vapours of allyl-itc triggered a rapid and substantial transcriptional response affecting numerous biological processes. for the purpose of this paper a few affected key processes were selected for a more detailed description of the genes involved: glucosinolate metabolism, sulphate uptake and assimilation, heat stress response, oxidative stress response, elicitor perception, plant defence and cell death mechanisms. these were chosen so as to relate transcriptional changes to the biosynthetic steps related to the generation of itcs, to identify gene regulations that might be involved in the observed effects of itc on plants reported in the literature and to present some avenues for further investigations in order to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects caused by itcs in plants.
