BACKGROUND
tomato  has rich genetic and genomic resources including comprehensive databases of expressed sequence tags , bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries, and genetic and comparative maps which are in the process of being linked to a physical map and eventually the euchromatic genomic sequence. these resources serve as template to study genetic variation and to manipulate agricultural traits. current genetic maps for tomato include  <dig>  restriction fragment length polymorphisms , cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences , and simple sequence repeats , as well as emerging genetic resources which include a comparative map with arabidopsis of over  <dig> conserved orthologous set  markers  <cit> . these maps were derived from populations that were developed between wild relatives  and cultivated varieties. this approach maximizes genetic variation and has led to the discovery and introgression of novel alleles for disease resistance  <cit> and fruit traits  <cit>  into cultivated germplasm. however, the nearly exclusive focus on wide crosses has left a void in our knowledge and ability to manipulate other traits of agricultural importance within cultivated tomato. there is a lack of molecular markers that detect nucleotide polymorphisms among elite breeding lines. with the exception of genes that were introgressed from wild species, the majority of the breeding efforts in tomato are derived from elite-by-elite intra-specific crosses, resulting in consistent improvement for yield and fruit quality  <cit> . increasing molecular marker density to facilitate the evaluation and analysis of elite-by-elite breeding populations is highly desirable.

given the discrepancy of resources available between inter-specific and intra-specific crosses, we sought to test the feasibility of a large-scale screen for identifying polymorphisms within cultivated tomato lines. previous examinations of est databases suggested that single nucleotide polymorphisms  could be detected within tomato est databases  <cit> . single nucleotide polymorphisms, are highly abundant in plant species. they can be associated with known genomic sequences and are bi-allelic  <cit> . current technology allows snps to be assayed cost-effectively for applications in breeding programs and genetic studies. analysis of tomato est sequences resulted in only limited information on snps that occurred within cultivated tomato germplasm. in a previous study, the genbank est database was mined for snps which resulted in  <dig> putative snps,  <dig> of which were confirmed empirically. of the  <dig> validated snps, 53% proved useful within cultivated germplasm  <cit> . a similar study using an algorithm that considered sequence context, but not sequence redundancy, identified  <dig> putative snps from a similar dataset from which only 27%  of the putative snps tested could be validated experimentally  <cit> . the paucity of snps within the ests can be attributed to low rate of polymorphism within gene coding regions of tomato and a limited sampling of genotypes in the databases, and shallow sampling within each of these genotypes. the current resources are thus insufficient for breeding studies.

extrapolation of these experimentally defined snp rates to the gene and genome level projects a rate of  <dig> snp every 4000– <dig> bp of coding sequence. variation in genes has been shown to be highest in untranslated regions   <cit>  and within introns in which nucleotide diversity is more tolerated compared to protein coding regions  <cit> . often, intron position is conserved between species  <cit> , therefore one can leverage the arabidopsis genome sequence and orthologous est sequences from different species to predict intron position. thus, a strategy for snp discovery is to utilize available est sequences and design primers that flank introns or amplify the 3' or 5' utr from genomic dna.

genomic resources of arabidopsis can be used to identify single-copy genes in tomato which in turn can be used as template to develop dna markers. a cos is defined as a set of genes that are conserved throughout plant evolution in both sequence and copy number  <cit> . sequences from a single-copy cos of arabidopsis can be used as a reference to bridge relationships across genes identified through ests in crops. a cos in tomato  was identified by comparing the set of unique gene sequences in tomato  to all translated proteins in the fully sequenced genome of arabidopsis  <cit> . approximately 10% of the  <dig>  tomato unigene sequences meet the defined cos criteria. the sgn cos i set was further refined to include pepper, potato, eggplant and coffee for a combined cos  of  <dig>  unigenes  <cit>  across five species. southern hybridization revealed that 85% of the cos tested are single-copy sequences in tomato and  <dig> other plant species from the solanaceae, asteraceae, leguminosae, cucurbitaceae, rosaceae, brassicaceae, poaceae, and malvaceae families  <cit> . using different approaches, we identified  <dig>  sequences as a cos between arabidopsis and tomato, lettuce, sunflower, soybean and maize, of which  <dig>  are represented in tomato. the parameters for developing the latter dataset are described at compositae genome project database  <cit>  and summarized in results and discussion. a cos database provides a unique resource that can be applied to marker development for crop improvement and assist in comparative genomic analyses. in this study, we developed primers flanking predicted introns in the tomato cos and used these to amplify genomic dna from several tomato genotypes. amplified loci were pre-screened to identify sequence variation using pools of dna from diverse genotypes. loci identified as polymorphic were subsequently sequenced for  <dig> genotypes representing closely related wild relatives, processing tomato germplasm adapted to arid and humid growing conditions, fresh-market germplasm, and heirloom germplasm. the resulting sequence data, described in the current paper, is intended to greatly increase the availability of dna-based markers for intra-specific tomato crosses and to characterize and manipulate traits important for tomato breeding populations.

RESULTS
conserved orthologous sets
our goal is to identify and characterize sequence variation within cultivated tomato in genes that can be used in genetic analysis, functional genomic studies, and breeding efforts. by focusing on a cos as the basis for marker discovery, we also intended to develop a sequence resource representing single-copy loci that can be assayed reproducibly for genetic analysis within sl and in other related species. the challenge to identify a cos with incomplete est datasets is to accurately predict single-copy and orthologous genes that do not represent paralogs. est databases are highly redundant and unigene sets of assembled ests tend to over-represent the complement of transcripts. for example, both the arabidopsis and rice est databases  represent about  <dig>  unigenes compared to less than  <dig> – <dig>  predicted genes with whole genome sequence  <cit> . the difference in number is attributable to allelic variation, sequencing errors, alternative splice forms, and paralogs which can not be easily addressed in the assembly of transcripts in the absence of a complete genome and sequence of full length cdnas.

designing a cos involves decisions regarding stringency of match, order of comparisons, and definitions of orthologs  <cit> . one approach taken to identify a cos is to compare unigene sets anchored to single-copy loci in arabidopsis and generate reciprocal best matches for pairwise comparisons among several species and arabidopsis  <cit> . with this strategy, only unigenes with a single best match to arabidopsis are considered. in tomato, this approach resulted in a cos of  <dig>  sequences  which was further used to design primers with homology across species to amplify loci in tomato, pepper, potato and coffee. fifteen loci were sequenced across these species for phylogenetic analysis. the strategy resulted in a cos that over-represented genes involved in organelle and chloroplast-associated proteins and dna/rna metabolism, and under-represented cell wall, transcription factors, protein kinases and signal transduction peptides  <cit> . we used a more conservative approach to identify a cos by first identifying single-copy proteins in arabidopsis using a "blastp all-vs-all" search and then comparing single-copy arabidopsis genes to all tomato ests  using tblastx. from these results, we identified the single best tomato est match  to an arabidopsis sequence and performed a blastn search against the arabidopsis genome to verify the hit. the  <dig>  tomato ests that had a single hit in arabidopsis were included in a cos which we designate ucd cos to distinguish it from the sgn cos i and sgn cos ii. as the number of ests used to create the ucd cos was less than that used in the sgn cos ii created later we expect the ucd cos to have less sequences than sgn cosii. by selecting a single est for each contig, incorrect assemblies of paralogs and errors due to alternative splicing are avoided  <cit> .

for transparency, we cross-referenced all ucd tomato cos to the sgn cos ii integrated dataset for solanum species . the  <dig>  ucd cos have single hits with a blast expect value cutoff of e- <dig> over 80% of the ucd contig length to  <dig>  sgn unigenes ,  <dig> tomato,  <dig> potato,  <dig> pepper and  <dig> coffee cos ii markers. the ucd cos represents  <dig> unigenes that are not in sgn cos ii which expands the total cos by 33% from  <dig>   to  <dig>  unigenes . to further investigate the application of the ucd cos, we evaluated the ability of  <dig> primers designed solely for tomato to amplify single-copy sequences in pepper and eggplant. primers designed from loci with cos represented in at least two species and arabidopsis were more likely to amplify single-copy loci in eggplant  and pepper  than those found only in the tomato cos. only two primers in eggplant and four primers in pepper amplified multiple fragments . this verifies the utility of conserved sequence in species with less genomic resources. although the independent approaches to cos development are similar, we have shown that they verify each other, yet can be complementary. nevertheless, both cos sets empirically yielded genomic resources to characterize putative single-copy conserved genes.

the size of introns in tomato
we designed primers spanning putative introns from  <dig>  ests in the ucd cos. greater than one primer set was designed for some contigs. intron positions were predicted by comparing tomato cos ests to arabidopsis protein sequence   <cit> . with these primers,  <dig> loci were amplified in  <dig> tomato lines . consequently, forward and reverse sequence across the resulting amplicons generated  <dig>  predicted introns from  <dig> unique contigs  derived from  <dig> primer sets . greater than one contig/locus resulted when forward and reverse sequences did not overlap when primers spanned large introns. a total of  <dig> of the  <dig> loci yielded blast hits to the original cos est database. the loci with poor blast results were due to the fact that the primers were located close to the intron  resulting in the near lack of sequence to cos est coding sequence. blast of genomic sequence data generated from pcr amplicons back to the corresponding est allowed intron size to be estimated for each contig by subtracting the last position  of a query from the corresponding first position  of the next match. intron positions were accurately predicted greater than 98% of the time based on differences between expected and predicted fragment sizes on agarose gels and sequence analysis. the experimentally estimated intron size ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. for  <dig> loci, the intervening region was either too large to form a contig from forward and reverse sequence pairs, or had no hits to ests. by assuming that the  <dig> pairs that did not assemble into a contig were comprised of introns that were at least  <dig>  bp in length, the predicted average intron length in tomato would be  <dig> bp. these estimates are consistent with the limited information in tomato and suggest a two-fold intron size increase in tomato relative to arabidopsis  <cit> . furthermore,  <dig> est sequences  have more than one intron. a comparison of our intron sequences to the tomato repeat database  using blast indicated that there are few defined repeats in these tomato introns. only  <dig> introns had homology to repeats in the database; one defined as a long terminal repeat, another as dna/mutator and the rest are annotated as unknown repeats.

diversity of tomato introns
pooling of samples has been used to efficiently screen bac libraries for presence of sequences, identify novel mutations through tilling, estimate gene frequencies in populations, and identify variants for specific traits through bulk-segregant analysis. we extended this idea to pre-screen dna sequences for polymorphism in germplasm. this approach is particularly efficient when screening narrow germplasm pools such as those found in the majority of agricultural crops, especially self-pollinated species such as tomato, which have gone through genetic bottlenecks during domestication and selection. single-stranded conformation polymorphism was suggested as a tool for screening loci for polymorphism  <cit> . in our experience, this approach was only effective for amplicons smaller than  <dig> bp , which is too small for efficient marker discovery in species with limited diversity and snp density.

to develop an efficient strategy for snp discovery in crops with narrow germplasm, we empirically determined that sequencing pools of four lines can effectively be employed to screen for polymorphisms . at first, we evaluated the variation among breeding lines and between species by sequencing across introns of  <dig> cos loci in  <dig> select tomato lines . this approach allowed us to refine the pooling strategy and establish a base line for polymorphism rate. this initial sequencing effort yielded  <dig>  polymorphic loci. amplicons for the remaining  <dig> loci were then sequenced in pools  for polymorphism discovery. of these loci,  <dig> , showed a potential polymorphism within or between pools . as the goal was to select for loci that were polymorphic in breeding germplasm, only sl lines were included in the pools for screening. the pooled strategy had an accuracy rate of 98%, with  <dig> loci showing polymorphisms in at least one line when sequenced individually . therefore, we reduced the sequencing efforts three-fold by using the pooled genotypes strategy.

by using a pooling and re-sequencing strategy, we uncovered variation in ten domesticated breeding lines of sl, one wild cherry tomato  and the progenitor species, s. pimpinellifolium  across predicted introns in  <dig> of  <dig> ests . on average, we assayed a minimum of  <dig> high quality base pairs per locus  with an average sequence read length of  <dig> bp . overall,  <dig>  snps were identified, of which  <dig> from  <dig> loci were polymorphic in sl breeding germplasm;  <dig> between slc and other lines; and  <dig>  between sp and other lines . interestingly,  <dig> snps were present within processing tomato lines and  <dig> within fresh market lines, but  <dig> differentiated the processing from fresh market classes indicating diversity among gene pools . in the same samples,  <dig> indels were also detected in  <dig> contigs with  <dig> indels from  <dig> loci in breeding germplasm;  <dig> between slc and other lines; and  <dig> between sp and other lines. fresh market and processing tomatoes differed by  <dig> indels . only  <dig> loci had indels and no snps. polymorphisms due to snps or indels range from  <dig> to 24% between any two breeding lines . ssr signatures  were identified in  <dig> loci of which  <dig> were polymorphic and  <dig> unique to the indel and snp databases . ten ssrs were scored as indels as well. overall,  <dig> est loci have sequence information within introns, of which  <dig> are polymorphic. all sequences are available at genbank  <cit> .

initial work  <cit>  showed that snp frequency is approximately 1/ <dig> bp when surveying coding sequence  between ta <dig> and rio grande. the work was based on identifying snps between only two sequenced genotypes, and therefore is an underestimate of the variation across a larger set of lines. within the  <dig> sl breeding lines in the current project,  <dig> %  of the loci were polymorphic with a snp frequency of 1/ <dig> bp, a  <dig>  fold increase over coding sequence reported  <cit> . although, these datasets are not directly comparable due to both the number and actual lines and loci being compared, they are in line with those reported in the literature. previous studies on a limited number of loci have reported a  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold  <cit>  increase in snp frequency in tomato introns vs. exons.

the results of our intron sequencing suggest that significant sequence diversity remains to be discovered in domesticated germplasm of tomato. these results appear to be corroborated by several studies in progress. sequencing  <dig> cos for a set of  <dig> landrace sl lines collected from three centers of diversity, found an average snp rate of 1/ <dig> bp across introns and exons with 60% of the snps having an allele frequency below 10%  <cit> . a second recent report showed that by randomly designing primers across ests  and sequencing  <dig> amplicons across  <dig> inbred lines, polymorphism ranged from 3% to 24% among sl inbred lines to 63% between sl inbred lines and s. pennellii, acc. la <dig>  <cit> . the frequency of snps ranged from 10% of loci in processing lines, 11% in fresh market lines and 14% in cherry tomatoes . the frequency of minor alleles  in tomato breeding germplasm was below 10% for 15/ <dig> snps. the average frequency of minor alleles  in our study was 18% across all the germplasm tested and 27% for breeding germplasm . the allele frequencies in our study may be higher as we pre-selected loci to be polymorphic in our germplasm and because our sampling was limited. snps with moderate allele frequencies  are particularly useful as they are informative in relevant germplasm for breeding. conversely, rare alleles can be particularly interesting if linked or are functional alleles for rare phenotypes for genetic studies and crop improvement. although, we chose to sequence introns of ests from a cos, the frequency of polymorphisms is in a similar range as other reports  <cit> . it is not clear that cos genes would have less recombination than genes not conserved among species, especially in introns. increasing the number and diversity of domesticated genotypes sequenced may increase the discovery of polymorphisms that can be applied to sl breeding populations. the genotypes we screened  represent genetic stocks and lines used in commercial processing and fresh market hybrids across the united states, europe and brazil.

in our data set, any given breeding line accounted for  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the polymorphism with 3– <dig> snps/locus in polymorphic loci. considering that we prescreened  <dig> loci and sequenced  <dig> polymorphic loci , we estimate that  <dig>  to  <dig> % of all loci differ in elite-by-elite crosses with the set of lines sampled. sp was polymorphic in 91% of loci sequenced with a snp frequency of 1/ <dig> bp . as only loci that were polymorphic in breeding lines were sequenced, this frequency for sp is likely biased. our estimate of polymorphism between sp and sl from the random set of  <dig> loci sequenced for all lines is 73%. as we only sampled two u.s. fresh market lines, our estimates for this class may have also been biased. by cross-referencing our dataset to current resources in the asterid family, including the updated tomato unigenes and sgn cosii dataset  <cit> , we have expanded the available cos in solanaceae; provided intron sequence associated with ests; and diversity information relevant to loci that can form a core marker set for translational genomics research in the solanaceae. of the  <dig> loci screened,  <dig> including  <dig> snp,  <dig> indel, and  <dig> ssr loci have been mapped  <cit>  ; the remaining loci are currently being mapped. these results further highlight that sl has evolved considerably from sp and the dilemma of application of resources built around wide crosses to elite-by-elite crosses. our dataset represents the most in depth study of variation in domesticated tomato and one of its closest progenitor species to-date.

CONCLUSIONS
leveraging of genomic tools across species boundaries to assay variation in relevant germplasm is key to the application of these resources for crop improvement and comparative genomics. in species with limited variation due to bottlenecks from domestication and subsequent breeding, identifying sufficient polymorphism for genetic studies will require that sequence data cover more varieties and both coding and non-coding sequences. we have provided sequence data for  <dig> loci in  <dig> accessions relevant to breeding and genetic mapping in tomato these resources should enable snp genotyping assays for high-throughput screening of germplasm for taxonomic, genetic mapping, functional analysis and breeding.
