BACKGROUND
plant terpenoids are important metabolites, and represent a class of hydrocarbons that have functions in photosynthesis, respiration and regulation of plant growth and development. they also have substantial economic values to serve as essential oils, colorants, flavors and anti-oxidative drugs  <cit> . all terpenoids are derived from the condensation of two common 5-carbon precursors in mep and/or mva pathway to produce monoterpenes , sesquiterpenes  and diterpenes  under the catalysis of various terpene synthases   <cit> . in arabidopsis, tps <dig> and tps <dig> are responsible for the biosynthesis of nearly all  <dig> sesquiterpenes  <cit> . citrus plants are rich of terpenoids, and volatile organic compounds, phytohormones, carotenoids, limonoid aglycones are produced in leaves, flowers, roots and fruits. monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes account for more than 80% of the total volatiles in citrus , and carotenoids  and limonoid aglycones are the derivatives of tetraterpenoids and triterpenoids  <cit> , while aba is regarded as a sesquiterpene usually produced from the degradation of carotenoids  <cit> . terpenoids in citrus play key roles in photosynthesis, plant growth regulation, plant-environment interactions and fruit quality.

most citrus fruits are generally colored by yellow or orange carotenoids particularly xanthophylls in the plastids during maturation  <cit> . some red-fleshed citrus cultivars, such as “cara cara” navel orange   <cit>  and and red-fleshed pummelo  predominantly accumulate lycopene and β-carotene  <cit> , whereas blood orange  is characterized by the accumulation of anthocyanin  <cit> . red-fleshed fruit is not only special in flesh color, but also distinctive in other qualities compared with wild-type fruit. chen et al.  <cit>  reported that the contents of some flavonoids are significantly different between red-fleshed and blonde-fleshed sweet oranges. yoo et al.  <cit>  revealed the differences in the contents of ascorbic acid, sugar, soluble solid and total carotenoid among  <dig> watermelons with different pulp colors, while different carotenoid, limonoid and aroma profiles of two pummelos  with different flesh color were also reported in citrus by liu et al.  <cit> .

tangerine  is well known as one of the four main cultivated citrus species for its wide application in juice industry. its fresh fruits can be processed or marketed owing to the traits of easy peeling, appealing color, pleasant aroma and good taste. tangerine fruit quality is usually determined by several characters such as color, aroma and bitterness  <cit> . a great part of these characters are determined by the composition of terpenoids, which constitute the largest and most diverse class of secondary or specialized metabolites mainly represented by phytohormones of abscisic acid  and gibberellic acid , carotenoids, volatile terpenoids and bitterness compounds of limonoid aglycones in citrus species  <cit> . citrus fruit color is mainly derived from the accumulation of carotenoids while flavonoids contribute to the yellow background color. its aroma is mainly derived from volatile organic compounds , whereas delayed bitterness usually results from the accumulation of limonin.

nrh tangerine , a spontaneous mutant originated from zhj tangerine  in haohuahong town, huishui county, guizhou province, china, has drawn extensive attention for its attractive traits of beef-red color in fruit rind and flesh, distinctive flavor and fewer seeds . however, the physiological and biochemical bases of these quality characters are poorly understood. here, to investigate the physiological and biochemical mechanisms of the fruit quality of nrh tangerine, contents of terpenoids including volatiles, carotenoids, limonoid aglycones and phytohormones were determined to fully investigate the differences in the mep and/or mva networks of terpenoid metabolism between nrh tangerine and its wild type.fig.  <dig> mature fruit of nrh tangerine  and its wild type zhj tangerine 




methods
materials
fruits of nrh and zhj were collected in 2 years  from trees grown in the same orchard  both at the commercially mature stage under the same management conditions. thirty fruits were harvested randomly from the peripheral canopy of at least  <dig> trees for each cultivar, and transported quickly to the laboratory in an ice-box. fruit flavedo and juice sacs were separated with a sharp scalpel, and then were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °c until analysis. samples were prepared in triplicates unless otherwise indicated.

extraction and determination of volatile compounds
in citrus, flavors are largely determined by the peel oil, especially in the flavedo part of a fruit. thus, flavedo of fruits harvested in  <dig> was used for volatile constituent analysis. volatile extraction and detection were conducted according to liu et al.  <cit> . three grams of powder was dipped in 15 ml of methyl tert butyl ether  containing 8697 μg chlorononane and 400 μg methyl nonanoate that served as an internal standard. after 1 h of microwave-assisted extraction , the organic layer was dried by na2so <dig>  finally, the final volume of the extracted liquid was blown to  <dig>  ml under stable nitrogen gas flow.

the profiling of volatiles was performed by using trace ultra gas chromatograph  combined with a dsq ii mass spectrometer   with a trace tr- <dig> ms chromatographic column . the operational parameters of gc-ms and quantitative parameters of volatiles followed the protocol of liu et al.  <cit> .

extraction and determination of carotenoids
the authentic standards of violaxanthin, 9-z-violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, xanthophyll, α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, phytoene were obtained from carotenature , while β-carotene and lycopene were purchased from sigma co. ltd .

to determine the pigments accounting for the beef-red color of nrh flesh, juice sacs in fruits were separated for carotenoids analysis.

carotenoids were extracted and analyzed as described by liu et al.  <cit> . one gram of juice sacs powder was dissolved in 15 ml extraction solvent . after centrifugation for 30 min at 4000 g, the supernatant was washed by saturated nacl solution and concentrated to dryness. then 4 ml mtbe was added and the sample was saponified with 2 ml of koh/water/methanol . after the saponification, water-soluble extracts were removed from the extract by adding nacl-saturated water. after evaporation under vacuum eppendorf  <dig> concentrator , the residue was re-dissolved in  <dig>  ml mtbe solution.

the carotenoid extracts  were separated by a waters  <dig> reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography  system equipped with a  <dig> photodiode array detector, a ymc c <dig> carotenoid column  and a  <dig> plus autosampler. the data were analyzed by empower chromatography manager software . the carotenoids were gradient eluted with methanol/acetonitrile  and mtbe .

extraction and determination of limonoid aglycones
the authentic standards of limonin and nomilin were purchased from sigma co. ltd . three grams of powder of juice sacs were extracted for limonin and nomilin analysis as demonstrated by li et al.  <cit> . a soxhlet extractor  was employed for 15 cycles of soxhlet extraction, then the filtered solution was collected and dried by using eppendorf  <dig> concentrator  at 30 °c. the dried extracts were added with 1 ml acetonitrile before hplc analysis. 20 μl samples were determined by using the same hplc system but separated with a c <dig> hplc column .

determine of phytohormone composition by using lc-ms
the standards of abscisic acid , jasmonic acid , indole-3-acetic acid  and salicylic acid  were purchased from olchemimm . phytohormones were extracted according to previously method  <cit> . a 50 mg portion of lyophilized juice sacs were homogenized with  <dig>  ml extraction solvent . after extraction for 12 h at 0 °c, the samples were dipped in  <dig>  ml extraction solvent, shaken for 1 h at 230 r/min, followed by the addition of 2 ml dichloromethane and shaking for another 1 h. after 10 min of centrifugation at 4000 g under 4 °c, the layers were transferred into a new  <dig>  ml tube and dried with a gentle stream of nitrogen. the resulting residue was re-dissolved in  <dig>  ml methanol, and then subjected to 15 min of centrifugation at 4000 g under 4 °c. 10 μl of the supernatant was taken out for analysis by using a uplc-esi-ms  equipped with a c <dig> column  as described before  <cit> .  <dig> % acetic acid was prepared as mobile phase a, and  <dig> % acetic acid-acetonitrile was prepared for mobile phase b. gas flow was set to 250 μl min− <dig> 

statistical analysis
xcalibur software was used to analyze the volatile compounds in selective ion monitoring  and total ion current  modes. the volatiles, carotenoid, limonoid aglycones and phytohormone were identified by specific retention times and the standard curves were compared with the authentic standard. data of the significant difference analysis were presented by means of anova with fisher’s least-significant-difference test.

bcompounds labeled with tn were quantified by total ion current  mode, while unlabeled compounds were quantified by selective ion monitoring  mode according to table  <dig> in previous published paper  <cit> . data were analyzed with t-test 




however, concentrations varied largely among different volatile compounds. for example, in nrh, the concentrations varied from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/g  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/g . additionally, the concentrations of specific volatile compounds also varied between nrh and zhj. except for monoterpene oxides, alcohols, aldehydes and esters, all other  <dig> classes of volatiles had significantly higher total concentrations in nrh than in zhj. for example, the total concentrations of monoterpene aldehydes, monoterpene ketones, acids and the unknown compound in nrh were  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold of those in zhj, respectively.

volatile terpenoids in both tangerines
the predominant volatile organic compounds detected in two cultivars were terpenoids. the total terpenoid concentrations in nrh and zhj were  <dig>  μg/g and  <dig>  μg/g, respectively, accounting for about  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the total volatiles .

the  <dig> detected monoterpenes accounted for the highest proportion  of the total volatiles in both tangerines , while others only accounted for  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the total volatiles in nrh and zhj, respectively. notably, the concentrations of  <dig> out of the  <dig> monoterpenes were higher in nrh, with d-limonene being the most abundant in both cultivars, followed by γ-terpiene, β-myrcene, α-pinene and β-pinene . however, the concentrations of both β-cis-ocimene and β-phellandrene were significantly higher in zhj than in nrh.fig.  <dig> classes and proportions of volatile compounds in fruit flavedo of nrh  and zhj 




as for the  <dig> monoterpene alcohols detected in both tangerines, they were at higher concentrations in nrh, particularly α-terpineol. both tangerines accumulated the highest level of β-linalool among all monoterpene alcohols, which amounted to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/g in nrh and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/g in zhj, respectively.

the total amount of monoterpene aldehydes in nrh was  <dig> -fold that in zhj. citronellal was found to be the major component of monoterpene aldehydes, whose concentration was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/g and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/g in two cultivars, respectively; while for other monoterpene aldehydes, including α-citral, β-citral, -2-hexenal and perillal, their concentrations varied from  <dig>  μg/g to  <dig>  μg/g. except for citronellal and -2-hexenal, other  <dig> monoterpene aldehydes were significantly different in concentration between the two tangerines, with relatively higher levels being detected in nrh.

a total of  <dig> monoterpene ketones, namely piperitone, carvone and 2-cyclohexen-1-one, -3-methyl-6-, were identified. each of the three monoterpene ketones had higher concentration in nrh, especially 2-cyclohexen-1-one, -3-methyl-6- , and their total concentration in nrh was  <dig> -fold that in zhj.

two monoterpene oxides were identified, including trans-limonene oxide and cis-limonene oxide. total monoterpene oxide concentration was lower in nrh than in zhj.

three monoterpene esters were detectable in both tangerines, and their total concentration was similar in nrh and zhj .

sesquiterpenes were detected to be the richest class, which included  <dig> volatile compounds from the two tangerines. germacrene b was the dominant sesquiterpene, followed by β-farnesene, δ-elemene, germacrene d and β-elemene, whose concentrations were all above 40 μg/g. however, only α-bergamotene was at a significantly higher level in nrh .

non-terpenoidsvolatile compounds determined in both tangerines
non-terpenoid volatile compounds detected in both tangerines
a total of  <dig> non-terpenoid volatiles were identified, including  <dig> alcohols,  <dig> aldehydes,  <dig> acids,  <dig> esters and  <dig> unknown. among these volatile compounds, aldehydes showed the highest abundance, which was up to  <dig>  μg/g and  <dig>  μg/g and accounted for  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the total non-terpenoid volatiles in nrh and zhj, respectively. nrh contained significantly higher 1-octanol, nonanal, decanal, hendecanal and trans-p-mentha- <dig> -dienol than zhj , while the concentration of n-hexadecanoic acid was extremely significantly different between the two tangerines .

carotenoid profiles
seven carotenoids were determined in both years , including violaxanthin, 9-z-violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, lutein, β-cryptoxanthin, β-carotene and phytoene . nrh accumulated higher levels of total carotenoids . β-cryptoxanthin was the most abundant carotenoid, accounting for more than 30% of total carotenoids in both tangerines, followed by 9-z-violaxanthin . all carotenoids, except for antheraxanthin and lutein, were higher in nrh than in zhj. in  <dig>  the contents of violaxanthin, 9-z-violaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, β-carotene, phytoene and total carotenoids in nrh were significantly higher than those in zhj. nrh had lower contents of antheraxanthin and lutein than zhj, and the difference in lutein content reached significant level. similar results were obtained in  <dig> table  <dig> carotenoid profiles in juice sacs of nrh and zhj in years of  <dig> and 2011

discussion
seventy-two volatile compounds were detected in both tangerines with different concentrations. among them, monoterpenoids  accounted for the largest proportion of total volatile compounds , while others  only accounted for the rest . d-limonene was the most abundant terpenoid , taking up more than 86% of the total volatile compounds. these results are consistent with our previous study of mangshanyegan  <cit>  and that of in tangerines  <cit> . in both tangerines, sesquiterpenes were the most abundant in types, while their total concentration only accounted for less than 1% of the total volatile compounds.

however, our previous reports on mangshanyegan  revealed that special volatiles of β-myrcene and linalool oxides are attributing to the balsamic and floral notes of aroma  <cit> . since no special volatile compound was found to be responsible for the distinctive flavor of nrh tangerine, it could be deduced that with a  <dig> -fold increase of total volatile terpenoids, the distinctive flavor of nrh might not be derived from the presence/absence of special volatiles; instead, it may be derived from the significantly altered concentrations or proportions of α-citral, β-citral, 2-cyclohexen-1-one, -3-methyl-6- and n-hexadecanoic acid in the background of increased monoterpene aldehydes, monoterpene ketones, acids and unknown compounds. thus, further experiment of aroma reconstitution will help to reveal the proportion of each volatile that contributes to the distinctive flavor of nrh.

carotenoids contribute to the beef-red color of nrh flesh
components of carotenoids were found to be common between the two tangerines. among the  <dig> carotenoids investigated in the  <dig> seasons,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively had higher and lower levels in nrh than in zhj. carotenoids are generally c <dig> terpenoid compounds. phytoene and phytofluene are colorless; xanthophylls including lutein, antheraxanthin and violaxanthin are responsible for the yellowish color; and β-carotene is an orange pigment while β-cryptoxanthin and β-citraurin are red pigments  <cit> . the majority of citrus fruits exhibit characteristic yellow or orange color, which is mainly derived from various carotenoids. there are also some small populations of red-fleshed cultivars primarily due to the accumulation of upstream carotenoids represented by lycopene and β-carotene, such as “cara cara” navel orange  <cit>  and red-fleshed pomelo  <cit> . in blood orange, the red flesh color is caused by the accumulation of anthocyanins   <cit> , and similar case was also found in zipi pomelo in hubei, china . ikoma et al. reported that β-cryptoxanthin is an important determinant in the classification of citrus genotypes  <cit> . some evidences were observed in loose skin mandarins such as satsuma mandarin, ponkan and dancy tangerine to suggest that the degradation of β-cryptoxanthin via the catalysis of ccd <dig> generates β-citraurin, which is responsible for the red-pigmentation of citrus peel  <cit> .

in our study, β-crytoxanthin was predominantly accumulated, which is consistent with the reddish color of juice sacs in nrh, as its content ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg/g dw in 2 years, and was significantly higher than that of zhj. thus, based on the results that the contents of total carotenoids and  <dig> individual carotenoids were higher while that of antheraxanthin and lutein was lower in nrh, and that β-citraurin was undetectable in the juice sacs of both tangerine, the beef-red color of nrh flesh might be largely attributed to the over accumulation of β-cryptoxanthin and β-carotene.

terpernoids metabolism might be regulated by common regulators
in our study, terpernoids including volatile compounds, carotenoids, aba and limonoid aglycones were identified, which are essential components of fruit quality  <cit> . plant terpenoids are originated from the same precursor isopentenyl diphosphate  or dimethylallyl diphosphate  by head-to-tailor or head-to-head condensations via mva and/or mep pathway. the mva pathway located in the cytosol was identified to provide c <dig> units for the synthesis of sesquiterpenes, diterpenoids, triterpenes; while in the plastid, mep pathway is thought to provide ipp for monoterpene, diterpenoid, carotenoid, phytohormone aba and polyprenol synthesis  <cit>  . from the perspective of the terpenoid pathway, volatile terpenoid compounds, carotenoids, aba and limonoid aglycones should all belong to the branches of the above mentioned pathways. in our study, monoterpenes  in the flavedo and carotenoids in the juice sacs were synthesized through mep pathway, and were significantly higher in nrh. however, aba, the dominant degradation product of carotenoids in plants, was at lower levels in the juice sacs of nrh. additionally, limonin, which is yielded from the mva pathway, was significantly lower in the juice sacs of nrh in two consecutive seasons.fig.  <dig> volatiles, carotenoids, imonoid aglycones and phytohormones in metabolic network of terpenoids  <cit> . note: mva, mevalonate; mep, 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate; ipp, isopentenyl diphosphate; ippi, isopentenyl diphosphate delta-isomerase; fps, farnesyl diphosphatesynthase; ggps, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; sps, solanesyl diphosphate synthase; dmapp, dimethylallyl diphosphate; ipt, isopentenyl transferase; fpp, farnesyl diphosphate; ss, sesquiterpenoid synthase; sqs, squalene synthase; ggpp, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; ds, diterpenoid synthase; ppp, polyprenyl diphosphate; gps, geranyl diphosphate synthase; pps, polyprenyl diphosphate synthase; gpp, geranyl diphosphate; spp, solanesyl diphosphate; ms, monoterpenoid synthase; psy, phytoene synthase; hst, homogentisate solanesyl transferase; ccd, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase; nxs, neoxanthin synthase; nced, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase. solid lines indicate a single enzymatic step, and dashed lines indicate several steps. terpenoids investigated in this study are shown in red font




thus, it could be suggested that both mep and mva pathways had been altered in the flavedo and juice sacs of beef-red flesh nrh tangerine. there have been increasing evidences showing the “cross-talk” of terpenoids between the two pathways, particularly in the direction from plastids to cytosol  <cit> . our results suggest the possibility that the enhancement of mep pathway might inhibit the mva pathway via a certain unknown co-regulatory mechanism, and vice versa. moreover, a metabolic flux in the forms of ipp, dmapp and other unknown intermediates together with a possible dynamic balance might be present between the two closely linked pathways.

it is interesting to note that aba was the most abundant among the detected phytohormones, and had lower level in nrh. aba was reported to be mainly produced from the cleavage of 9-z-violaxanthin to produce xanthoxin, which is further oxidized to generate aba  <cit> . in our study, the content of 9-z-violaxanthin was significantly higher in nrh than in zhj, suggesting that the amount of 9-z-violaxanthin in the pulp is not a limiting factor for aba biosynthesis. this is not in agreement with previous report of alquezar et al. on cara cara orange  <cit> , who suggested that aba level was in parallel with the changes in the level of 9-z-violaxanthin. in this study, the aba level in nrh was significantly lower than that in zhj, indicating a possible feedback regulation of aba biosynthesis on carotenoid metabolism. collectively, carotenoids play roles in the synthesis of phytohormones, volatiles  and some defense compounds. carotenoid accumulation levels are partly determined by the degradation rate of cleavage dioxygenases   <cit> . ccd <dig> is believed to be involved in the degradation of carotenoids to produce apocarotenoid, which is further oxidized to phytohormone aba and volatiles  <cit> . in arabidopsis seeds, ccds may contribute to the apocarotenoid-derived flavors especially in maturing seeds, while loss of function of ccds leads to significantly higher carotenoid levels . reports had proposed that some volatile compounds are derived from carotenoids, especially from the degradation of β-carotene and lycopene, such as β-ionone, geranylacetone, pseudoionone, β-cyclocitral, geranial, theaspirone, α-damascenone and β-damascenone, linalool and other terpenoid aldehydes and ketones  <cit> . in our study, the total carotenoid content and total volatile concentration in nrh were significantly higher than those in zhj, while the aba level in nrh was significantly lower than that in zhj, suggesting a favored pathway for terpenoid-derived volatiles rather than the aba synthesis pathway, though both pathways are closely related to carotenoid degradation.

what’s more, as we described above, some citrus are, although similarly altered to present red-flesh fruit color which previously known as the parallel mutation  <cit>  as if similar mutation mechanisms were behind. however, through comparing our metabolite analysis with that on red-flesh citrus, we can speculate that the actual mechanisms of the transformation to red flesh color might vary among different cultivars. notably, an interesting question that remains to be answered is whether carotenoid biosynthesis is prone to be regulated by various factors or by mutations. at least, since carotenoids are a group of antioxidants and precursors of some phytohormones and volatiles, the accumulation of total or specific carotenoids may enhance the resistance of plants against certain stresses including various mutations, and consequently change the terpenoid metabolism and related pathways, or vice versa. thus, terpenoid metabolisms should be considered as a network in the studies of the mechanisms in such red-flesh citrus.

CONCLUSIONS
our study suggested that the mep pathway was enhanced in nrh tangerine, while the mva pathway was relatively inhibited. however, a certain unknown co-regulatory mechanism might be present in the metabolism pathway of secondary metabolites  in beef-red flesh mutant. our study provides new insights into the regulatory network of terpenoid metabolism and mutation mechanism of red-fleshed citrus.
