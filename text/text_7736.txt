BACKGROUND
vibrio cholerae is widely acknowledged as one of the most important waterborne pathogen causing gastrointestinal disorders. cholera toxin  is a major virulence determinant of v. cholerae. this bacterium is indigenous to fresh and blackish water environments in tropical, subtropical and temperate areas worldwide, the threat of epidemic cholera is restricted primarily to developing countries with warm climates  <cit> . v. cholerae causes seafood borne infection, water-borne outbreaks and epidemics in terrestrial environments  <cit> . therefore, ingestion of raw or undercooked seafood such as shrimp and drinking water contaminated with v. cholera are risk factors in humans  <cit> . most v. cholerae isolates from the environment do not produce ct, nor do they possess the genetic potential to produce ct. v. cholerae o <dig> and o <dig> are the major seroytpes associated with illness, and some v. cholerae non-o <dig> and non-o <dig> isolates produce ct. these findings necessitate regular examination of v. cholerae isolates for their ability to produce ct in order to assess their clinical significance  <cit> .

detection of ct-producing v. cholerae using conventional culture-, biochemical- and immunological-based assays is time-consuming and laborious, requiring more than three days. commercially available kits can not distinguish between the heat-labile enterotoxin  of escherichia coli and ct. a rapid, reliable and practical assay for the detection of ct-producing v. cholerae has thus been sought. several pcr assays offer a more sophisticated approach to the identification of vibrio cholerae  <cit> . although pcr assays provide more rapid identification of vibrio cholerae than conventional assays, they require the use of electrophoresis to detect amplified products, which is time-consuming and tedious. real time pcr assays recently developed for the rapid identification of vibrio cholerae  <cit>  are not routinely used due to their requirement for an expensive thermal cycler with a fluorescence detector.

among other techniques, however, one promising candidate is a novel nucleic acid amplification method termed loop-mediated isothermal amplification   <cit> . lamp is based on the principle of autocycling strand displacement dna synthesis performed by the bst dna polymerase large fragment for the detection of a specific dna sequence with specific characteristics  <cit> . this offers a number of advantages: first, all reactions can be carried out under isothermal conditions ranging from  <dig> to 65°c; second, its use of six primers recognizing eight distinct regions on the target nucleotides means that specificity is extremely high  <cit> ; and third, detection is simplified by visual assessment using the unaided eye, without the need for electrophoresis  <cit> . thus, lamp assay is faster and easier to perform than conventional pcr assays, as well as being more specific  <cit> . furthermore, because the lamp assay synthesizes a large amount of dna, the products can be detected by simple turbidity. thus, compared to pcr assays, expensive equipment is not necessary to give a high level of precision  <cit> . these features allow simple, rapid and cost-effective detection  <cit> . also, the increase in the turbidity of the reaction mixture according to the production of precipitate correlates with the amount of dna synthesized  <cit> . various lamp assays for the identification of pathogenic organisms have been developed  <cit> , however, no assay for the detection of ct-producing v. cholerae has been described.

here, we describe a sensitive, rapid and simple lamp assay for the detection of ct-producing vibrio cholerae. sensitivity was determined in pure cultures and spiked human feces.

RESULTS
lamp products were detected from all  <dig> ct-producing v. cholerae strains. no lamp products were detected from any of the  <dig> ct non-producing v. cholerae and  <dig> non-v. cholerae strains . the pcr assay required more than  <dig> h, while the lamp assay was markedly faster, requiring for amplification 12– <dig> min with a single colony on tcbs agar from each of  <dig> ct-producing v. cholerae strains and less than  <dig> min with spiked human feces . the assay required less than  <dig> min and  <dig> min for detection of ct-producing v. cholerae with a colony on tcbs agar and with spiked human feces from the beginning of dna extraction to final determination.

+, positive reaction; -, negative reaction ; nd, not determined.

as shown in table  <dig>  sensitivities of the lamp assay for ct-producing v. cholerae o <dig> strain 13h <dig> with pure cultures and spiked human feces were found to be  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu per ml  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu per g . further, the sensitivity of the lamp assay was 10-fold higher than that of the pcr assay . the dilutions of 10-3-10- <dig>  showed an increase in turbidity  and was visible as white turbidity but not that of 10- <dig> . sensitivities determined by the two methods were constantly matched with each other.

+, triplicate assay showed all positive.

±, triplicate assay showed both positive and negative .

-, triplicate assay showed all negative.

discussion
the bacterial culture test for the isolation and identification of ct-producing v. cholerae from human feces required 3– <dig> d, with plating onto selective agars, sequential subculture and ct productivity test. in contrast, the lamp assay was markedly faster. for pcr assay, 4– <dig> h is required for amplification, electrophoresis and staining, while the lamp assay requires for dna extraction from specimens and amplification less than 35– <dig> min. further, amplification of the lamp assay could be judged by visual assessment using the unaided eye, without the need for electrophoresis. the lamp assay was more sensitive, rapid and simple than the conventional pcr assay. therefore, the lamp assay is more effective in detecting ct-producing v. cholerae than the conventional pcr assay.

ct is closely related to lt at the immunological and genetic levels,  <cit> , therefore their discernment is critical. a commercial reversed passive latex agglutination assay kit for the detection of ct/lt is available. however, this kit is unable to discern between ct and lt. although pcr assays have been shown suitable for the specific detection of the ctx gene without confusing the lt gene  <cit> , the procedure is time-consuming and tedious. we therefore developed a new and specific lamp assay for ct-producing v. cholerae. a primer set based on the ctxa gene was designed to prevent the confusion of ct and lt with highly conserved and specific regions for ct.

the sensitivity of the lamp assay shown in table  <dig> seems a little high, and table  <dig> indicates detection of  <dig>  cfu per reaction in 2/ <dig> replicates. we adopted  <dig> h-enrichment not to reach stationary phase for the determination of the sensitivity, according to fedio et al  <cit> . however, the samples may, to some extent, contain dnas derived from dead or viable but non-cultivable  cells  <cit>  in the present study, which may have affected the sensitivity we determined. further work is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

the frequent outbreaks caused by ct-producing v. cholerae in developing countries  <cit>  highlight the need for the rapid and accurate identification of the species. we successfully developed the first lamp assay for detection of ct-producing v. cholerae from spiked human feces. application of this assay to food and environmental microbiology should facilitate a comprehensive approach to the control of cholera infection and the rapid and sensitive detection of small numbers of ct-producing v. cholerae in food and environmental specimens.

CONCLUSIONS
the lamp assay provided markedly more sensitive, simple and rapid detection of ct-producing v. cholerae than conventional biochemical and pcr assays. further, it can be applied to the direct detection of ct-producing v. cholerae with spiked human feces. the lamp assay for detection of ct-producing v. cholerae required less than  <dig> min with a colony on tcbs agar and  <dig> min with spiked human feces from the beginning of dna extraction to final determination. the lamp assay is a powerful tool for the rapid and sensitive detection of ct-producing v. cholerae, and will facilitate the early diagnosis of cholera in humans.
