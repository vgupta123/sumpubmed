BACKGROUND
much recent research efforts have been devoted to studying gene functions in the context of highly dynamic and modular cellular networks  <cit> . valuable information about a gene's function can be obtained from its interaction with other genes  <cit> . apart from the traditional hierarchical way of gene function annotation, functional genomics takes a bottom-up approach to assemble gene interaction networks based on all pair-wise gene interactions detected. from such genetic interaction maps, functional modules representing various biological pathways and processes can then be extracted by computational approaches. those modules naturally suggest novel gene functions in the relevant biological processes  <cit> . the interactions between genes are of course highly dynamic spatially and temporally. however, one of the most intuitive yet fundamental questions about genetic interactions is whether the normal functioning of two genes depends on each other. synthetic lethality identifies genes that complement each other's function: two genes are synthetic lethal if either single mutant is viable, but the double mutant combination is lethal. high-throughput experiments such as synthetic genetic array   <cit>  and synthetic lethality analyzed by microarray   <cit>  have been done for genome-wide synthetic lethality analysis on saccharomyces cerevisiae, where a single mutant  is introduced into the complete pool of viable yeast single-deletion  strains. synthetic lethality data obtained through sga, slam or rna interference has shed much new light on essential biological pathways and the function assignment for many previously uncharacterized genes for the model organisms yeast and c. elegans  <cit> . hierarchical clustering of the sga dataset suggest that two synthetic lethal genes are likely to  reside in two redundant parallel pathways or  complement each other's function in two branches of one essential pathway  <cit> . computational methods integrating physical protein interactions and other genomic features seem to suggest that significantly more synthetic lethal interactions occur between parallel pathways  <cit> . given the incomplete and error-prone synthetic lethal interaction map, it is highly desirable to investigate methods that extract biologically relevant information probabilistically, which accommodates network properties such as degree distribution and confidence of the links. along this line, we have developed in this study a probabilistic model for characterizing synthetic lethal interaction motifs and an algorithm that automatically groups genes sharing similar motifs into pathways. when applied to the sga dataset, our method automatically uncovers known and novel gene modules that correlate favourably with gene ontology  annotations.

RESULTS
data sources
genetic interaction data is obtained from sga analysis in yeast  <cit> . the original query gene set includes  <dig> non-essential genes and  <dig> essential genes, tested against a library of all non-essential gene deletions. interpretation of synthetic lethality involving essential genes is problematic since the intermediate  phenotypes exhibited by conditional alleles of essential genes may include loss of function, unregulated function, and gain of function aspects. thus we focus on synthetic lethal interactions between null alleles of non-essential genes, which by definition result from solely loss of function mutations. ignoring library genes that have no interaction with any of the  <dig> query genes, our dataset consists of  <dig> query genes linked to  <dig> library genes by  <dig> interactions. both the query and the library sets contain hubs with high interaction counts .

yeast protein complex data were obtained from two high-throughput studies, tap and hms-pci  <cit> . protein complexes that contained two or more non-essential proteins were used .

computational method
the expectation maximization  algorithm has been widely used to detect motifs in biopolymer sequences, where a position weight matrix representing a recurring pattern  in multiple unaligned sequences is built iteratively by maximum likelihood scoring  <cit> . such probabilistic approach is most suitable for the detection of patterns with a stochastic nature, which we have little prior knowledge of. in this study, we have developed an algorithm for finding genes in the same pathway, which we shall refer to as genetic interaction motif finding by expectation maximization . note the difference between motif here defined by genetic interaction pattern and the network topological motifs  <cit> . the model is developed under the hypothesis that genes within the same pathway exhibit a similar pattern of synthetic lethal interactions where a subset of common interaction partners are genes in complementary pathways  <cit> . for example, rvs <dig> and rvs <dig> are two queries that belong to the rvs <dig> complex. enhanced synthetic lethal interactions with members of the rpd <dig> complex have been observed . the rvs <dig> complex proteins are ar adaptor proteins involved in actin regulation, endocytosis and viability following starvation or osmotic stress. the rpd <dig> histone deacetylase complex is involved in silencing at telomeres. in particular, dep <dig>  a member of the rpd <dig> complex is a transcriptional modulator of phospholipids biosynthesis and also maintains mating efficiency and sporulation. thus it is reasonable to infer that these two protein complexes are functionally complementary during endocytosis and mating or sporulation after starvation when the biological processes of the two complexes are tightly coupled.

in our analysis, we focus on finding motifs from the synthetic lethal interaction patterns of query genes. let xi =  denote the interaction partner list for query gene i, where xij =  <dig> if i interacts with library gene j and xij =  <dig> otherwise. thus the entire data set is xi, i =  <dig> ,...,q. the total numbers of query is q =  <dig> and the total number of the library genes that interact with at least one query gene is n =  <dig>  we initiate a search with a query gene s and aim to find all other genes in the same pathway as the seed gene s. we do this by iteratively constructing a motif for the group and hence identifying motif members.

mathematically, we divide the query gene set into two sets, a motif set a ={ai}, i =  <dig> ,...am, initialized to contain just the seed gene, and a non-motif set b = {bi}, i=am+ <dig>  am+ <dig>  l, am+bm, containing the remaining genes. the number of query genes in the motif and non-motif sets are am and bm, respectively, with am+bm=q. we assume that genes in the motif set and those in the non-motif set have different probabilities of interacting with a library gene j, which are denoted by paj and pbj, respectively. as will be explained in discussion, this allows existence of hub library genes explicitly. the probability that query i belongs to the motif set is denoted by zi. the parameters paj, pbj and zi, where j =  <dig> ...,n and j =  <dig> ...,q, are estimated iteratively.

the expectation maximization  algorithm has been used for maximum likelihood estimation with missing information. in our scenario, given a seed gene, missing information is represented by the correct partition of the entire gene pool into a motif set a and a non-motif set b starting from an initial motif estimate provided by the seed. the likelihood function, i.e. the conditional probability of observing measured data given the partition, is

l=p=∏i=1am∏j=1n×∏i=am+1am+bm∏j=1n.

motif members of arl <dig>  skt <dig>  ctf <dig> and ric <dig> are obtained by choosing different values of initialization parameter p. most motifs show little dependency on p for p ≥  <dig> .

these gene modules correlate well with pathways inferred by hierarchical clustering .

one important property of gimf is that it is non-commutative: if gene a identifies gene b as a motif member, it is not necessarily true that gene b identifies gene a as its motif member. interestingly, we have observed that a seed gene tends to first pull up motif members that share a globally similar interaction pattern. if such genes are lacking, then it finds genes with locally similar interaction pattern. this enables us to probe the case when two genes' interaction partners are only similar on a local scale. this is not possible with pair-wise comparison metrics, which are commutative. for a more systematic analysis, we use gimf to build gene networks. first, query genes with very few interactions  are removed from the list of seeds. then each of the remaining query genes is used as a seed and its motif members are generated by gimf. for every query gene pair, if i and j are each other's motif member, then connect i and j with a type  <dig> edge. we call the network thus constructed a type  <dig> gimf network . this network contains  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges, which form two clusters and eight individual pairs. the smaller cluster is a fully connected sub-graph corresponding to the pac <dig> complex. the larger cluster with  <dig> genes , representing the dynein-dynactin spindle orientation pathway. kip <dig> was not detected by hierarchical clustering  <cit> .

apparently, the bi-directional rule only retains genes with globally similar interaction pattern. this can be quite stringent since genes have multiple functions and two genes operating in one pathway may have distinct roles in other pathways they participate and thus only share a fraction of synthetic lethal interaction partners. thus we extend type  <dig> network by the following simple rule: for each gene pair  in the type  <dig> network, add common motif members k of genes i and j that are not already in the network . connect k to i and j with a type  <dig> edge. we call the extended network a type  <dig> network . this analysis reveals more information in the dynein-dynactin pathway. the majority of type  <dig> edges occur between the group members of this cluster, which elevates the confidence that the genes within this cluster are closely related. evidence that genes in this cluster are biologically related include the presence of a dynactin protein complex , reported protein-protein interactions between nip100-pac <dig>  pac11-dyn <dig>  pac11-num <dig>  <cit>  and the suggestion that ymr299c functions as dynein light intermediate chain  <cit> . in the type  <dig> network, several new members are incorporated into the cluster, including nbp <dig>  bik <dig> and ctf <dig>  the molecular function of nbp <dig> and ctf <dig> are unknown while bik <dig> is involved in microtubule binding. nbp <dig> shows hyperosmotic and heat response and is a negative regulator of protein kinase activity. ctf <dig> is a subunit of a complex with ctf8p that shares some subunits with replication factor c and is required for sister chromatid cohesion. it has been known that the mutants of six genes  in this cluster show nuclear migration defect in cell division process. a recent experiment has confirmed that deletion mutants of kip <dig>  bik <dig> and ctf <dig> also exhibit moderate to severe nuclear migration defects  <cit> . these three genes have not been detected by two way clustering  <cit> .

under our hypothesis, genes with a similar synthetic interaction pattern  are likely to reside in the same pathway or map to proteins in the same complex. thus the motif members are expected to have functional similarities at various levels. we evaluate the biological relevance of the type  <dig> and type  <dig> networks by computing three parameters for each edge : the correlations with the gene ontology  annotations ; the fraction of gene products that are within the same protein complex as determined by high-throughput mass spectrometry; and the fraction that are synthetic lethal. these parameters have also been computed for all directly synthetic lethal gene pairs. the type  <dig> gene pairs' correlations for biological process, molecular function and cellular component go annotations are , while those of the type  <dig> network are , comparing to  for directly synthetic lethal gene pairs . clearly, much tighter functional associations are obtained between gene pairs with either globally or locally similar synthetic lethal interactions than gene pairs that are directly synthetic lethal interactions, confirming the observation of between-pathway enrichment by wong et al. and kelly et al.  <cit> . significantly more type  <dig> gene pairs map to proteins within the same complex than either type  <dig> gene pairs or directly synthetic lethal gene pairs. same-complex membership may explain the higher molecular function correlation for type  <dig> gene pairs.

p: biological process; f: molecular function c: cellular component. fsl: fraction of pairs that are directly synthetic lethality; fpc: fraction of pairs that are within the same protein complex. the gimf type  <dig> network contains  <dig> genes and  <dig> edges while the type  <dig> network contains  <dig> genes and  <dig> edges.

discussion
in this section, we explore a few important issues in terms of the robustness and tuning of gimf. without loss of generality, the discussion is primarily based on learning pathway association on the sga dataset.

it has been widely known that em algorithm very often converges to local maxima in the evaluation of posterior likelihood function or log-likelihood  <cit> . in application to motif  discovery in dna sequences, early versions em assumed the existence of a single motif and aimed to find the motif that globally optimized the likelihood function. however, when multiple consensus sequences are present in the dataset, numerous local maxima in the likelihood function can well correspond to biologically meaningful motifs. one approach to finding multiple motifs is to initialize the em from different starting points, typically selected from patterns occurring in the data, which may then relax to local maxima. this approach may be enhanced, as in the meme algorithm, by erasing motifs previously found so that multiple motifs are found in decreasing order of likelihoods. using these two strategies, meme successfully detects multiple promoter consensuses from the combined crp/lexa datasets <cit> .

in gimf, we achieve a similar effect by initializing the model using seed gene's interactions, thus narrowing down the search space to the module that includes the seed. without any prior knowledge of goodness of seeds and their consensus interactions, two problems are noteworthy: i) motifs generated by different seeds may be redundant; ii) certain motifs may deviate from their seeds during the iterative process. these two issues are addressed below:

i) motifs generated by different seeds may be redundant
to better understand the dissimilarity between distinct motifs, we have calculated the euclidean distance between each pair of motifs p^als1

ii) certain motifs may deviate from their seeds during the iterative process
in some cases, the em algorithm may eject a seed gene from a motif. this occurs for eight seed genes when p =  <dig>  using the threshold zi >  <dig>  . those seeds either have few interactions and/or have interactions that overlap largely with the interaction partners of some hub genes, such as the pac <dig> complex genes. indeed, most of their motif members are hub genes, whose interaction profiles override that of the seed genes during the iteration. thus to ensure each seed stay in the motif, we can slightly modify the algorithm by fixing zseed =  <dig> during all iterations. in other words, the motif search is conditioned on the seed being part of the motif. indeed, for the eight seeds mentioned above, this modification keeps the seed gene itself in the motif till convergence while all other motif members stay unchanged. clearly, this procedure has no effect on the  <dig> seeds that are already in motif without such conditioning.

symmetry imposed by type  <dig> edges serves as a conservative filtering procedure that eliminates redundancy and impact of hub genes dominating interaction profiles, which reveals gene networks with tight functional correlations, which supports our finding that the local optimums in gimf correspond to biologically relevant modules.

we have investigated how the choice of p, the initialization parameter that represents our confidence on seed gene's interactions, affect the motifs. indeed, the sensitivities of different motifs to p is non-uniform. we quantify the goodness of a seed and its motif by observing stability of its motif members across different choices of p. genes with less than five interaction partners  are not used as seeds. for every remaining query gene, we extract its motif members with p ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the sets of motif members extracted at p =  <dig>  is used as the reference to compute a jaccard coefficient  <cit> . denote the set of motif members for seed gene i obtained with initialization parameter p by mpi

to better evaluate the statistical significance of motifs detected by gimf, we have computed the false positive rates on randomized datasets with the same degree distribution as the original synthetic lethal dataset. randomization is done by a rewiring procedure as detailed in  <cit> . the fraction of overlapping links between the randomized network and the original network is around 15%. since a random network should not contain any biologically relevant motif, any motif detected is a false positive. thus for the gimf algorithm, we use every query as a seed gene and any motif member returned other than the seed itself is considered a false positive. the numbers of false positives on  <dig> randomized networks are shown in fig. s <dig>  without imposing the bi-directionality constraint, the average total number of false positives for  <dig> seed genes is  <dig>  the average number of seeds that generates any false positives is  <dig>  out of  <dig>  on the real dataset, the number of seeds leading to motif detection is t =  <dig>  thus this corresponds to a p-value of 10- <dig> calculated as tail probability at t =  <dig> from a poisson distribution. a detailed look at the false positive pairs of gimf shows that most seeds that lead to false positives have very few interactions with the library genes. the top  <dig> seeds producing the most false positives have  <dig>  interactions on average and their false positive motif genes are mostly promiscuous hub genes. however, no false positives are observed when the promiscuous genes are used as seeds. when bi-directionality is imposed on motif detection, false positive drops to  <dig> for all the  <dig> trials. thus for an asymmetric metric like gimf, we can impose symmetry constraint to mask the effects of promiscuous genes. additional information can be obtained by elevating stringency once the reliable gene pairs are identified.

the treatment of hub genes is a problematic issue in the analysis of power-law networks. hubs arise from many different sources including intrinsic error in the experimental technique  and experimental bias . because of this heterogeneity, the treatment of promiscuous genes should be context-based. in the case of experimental error-induced hubs, a straightforward approach is to ignore all hub-associated links. this filtering method has been used to reduce the number of candidate pathways dramatically in the analysis of signal transduction networks  <cit> . however, the role of hub genes in the sga data set is subtle. genes in the pac <dig> complex are hubs that have enriched synthetic lethal interaction with genes in many other complexes, such as ctf <dig> and pac <dig>  many of the pac10-associated links are biologically relevant since pac <dig> is indeed functionally coupled to a broad spectrum of biological pathways which themselves are functionally associated. thus removing hub links entirely unsurprisingly leads to the loss of useful information and failure to detect some relevant pathways. gimf treats this problem by permitting an increase in the parameter pbj for hub library genes that are not part of the motif. thus, we are able to extract biologically meaningful pathways by keeping the hub library genes whose impact is, however, automatically down-weighted.

this idea is tested on the dynein-dynactin gene pairs. using gimf we identified  <dig> dynein-dynactin pairs with the original sga dataset. then we tested gimf on five filtered datasets generated by removing interactions with the top  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hub library genes, respectively. the corresponding fractions of interaction eliminated are  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and 16%. with model parameters unchanged, gimf recovers  dynein-dynactin pairs on the five datasets, respectively. the reduced coverage is expected from the removal of some biologically relevant hub links. however, a substantial number of those pairs are retained when interactions with the top  <dig> and  <dig> hub library genes are absent. these results suggest that a statistical method that explicitly models the skewed degree distribution is a better strategy for pattern discovery in the presence of hubs than using simple filtering techniques in conjunction with methods that do not take into account the hub effect.

the assumption in gimf that the probability of an edge between a query and a library gene pair is proportional to the degree of the library gene works sufficiently well for the synthetic lethal interaction dataset. however, when extending the present model to other types of networks especially those with non-directional links, it would be beneficial to characterize the link probability in a subgraph based on local connectivities  <cit> . in this model, the link probability between a pair of genes depends on the degree of both genes. this allows us to consider each interaction in the context of its subgraph, thus has a good promise to extract motifs in power-law networks by their local deviations from randomness  <cit> . it would be interesting to integrate the local models into our algorithm in motif extraction of other interaction networks such as protein interaction networks.

recently, kelley et al. have integrated physical protein-protein interactions to dissect synthetic lethal gene pairs into between-pathway and within-pathway paradigms  <cit> . while the focus of our study is different from their work, gimf has an interesting correspondence with their algorithm. the algorithm proposed by kelley et al. to construct between-pathway or within-pathway model is essentially a local search procedure described by sharan et al  <cit> . starting from a seed node, nodes whose contributions to the current seed are maximal are added one at a time. the operation is repeated in a breadth-first search fashion so long as it increases the overall score of the subgraph. this is equivalent to maintaining a set of motif and non-motif nodes each with probability  <dig> and only the interaction between directly linked nodes are considered during the iteration. in contrast, gimf maintains a probability of being in the motif set for each node, thus allowing all nodes to have contribution in each iteration during motif building. the assignment of a node to the motif versus non-motif category is only determined when the probabilities converge. a similar breadth-first search procedure can also be applied to gimf in automatically extracting gene pathways. the between-pathway and within-pathway discovery by kelley et al.  <cit>  aligns with the conclusion by tong et. al  <cit>  that synthetic lethal interactions are more abundant between genes that have the same mutant phenotype and the genes encoding proteins within the same protein complex.

this idea is illustrated in fig.  <dig>  where "interaction", "no-interaction", "prohibited self-interaction" are represented by red, black and grey respectively. the matrix shows partial interaction profiles for five query genes. query genes a, b, c and d, e belong to two different motifs. the within-pathway pattern shows the situation where synthetic lethal interactions are more abundant between motif members than between genes belonging to different motifs. the between-pathway pattern shows two motifs that represent two complementary pathways, with synthetic lethal interactions enriched between the pathways and depleted within a pathway. to permit a quantitative discussion, we define a within-motif score  to characterize whether synthetic lethal interactions for motif genes with each other are enriched  or depleted . let wmsi represent the score for motif i given by

the wms was computed for three sets of motifs generated: i) for seeds in the type  <dig> network; ii) for all seeds from the query set; iii) for seeds in  <dig> randomized datasets described earlier . the distribution of wms values for motifs in the actual network appears bimodal, with greater probability for motifs with between-pathway character . the wms distribution for the type  <dig> network has significantly more between-pathway character compared to motifs discovered in random network . motifs in the entire network also have significantly more between-pathway character, as judged by smaller wms values, than motifs in the random network . motifs from the type  <dig> network show marginal significance for negative wms values , whereas motifs from the random network have significantly positive wms values . in summary, these results demonstrate that synthetic lethal interactions leading to motifs have significant between-pathway character, particularly when compared with motifs detected in randomized networks.

though the purpose of this study is to develop a probabilistic model for characterizing synthetic lethal interaction motifs and a pathway identification algorithm based on synthetic lethal interaction datasets, the model holds good potential as an integrative method which combines multiple sources of evidence. if the sources of evidence are independent, the new likelihood function should be the multiplication of those for individual evidences. when the sources of evidence are not independent, then a bayesian learning approach such as the framework developed by jansen et al.  <cit>  should be considered. a detailed discussion on the extension of gimf into an integrative approach is however, beyond the scope of this study and hence will not be further considered here.

CONCLUSIONS
a probabilistic model and an automated algorithm  have been shown to be effective in unsupervised motif learning of genetic interaction data. starting from a seed pattern of genetic interaction partners, the method iteratively identifies genes that share the pattern and characterizes the pattern with a probabilistic motif. functional associations are inferred from motif membership, rather than from existence of a direct genetic interaction linking two genes. genes that belong to the same connected components in type i and type ii networks have well correlated go annotations, and are more likely to share annotations than genes connected by direct synthetic lethal interactions. synthetic lethal interactions tend to be depleted between genes within a motif, suggesting that synthetic lethal interactions occur primarily between-pathway rather than within-pathway.

several desirable features of the proposed algorithm for analyzing genetic interaction data include strong 0/ <dig> predictions for genes sharing a motif, asymmetric property and the ability to automatically down-weight the impact of promiscuous genes with large degrees. we have shown that the asymmetry can be exploited to identify even tighter associations between genes and mask the impact of promiscuous genes. furthermore, we conjecture that this asymmetric property may be useful in discriminating genes that are exclusive to a single pathway from genes that are shared in multiple pathways.

the probabilistic motifs naturally down-weight the importance of promiscuous genes with many interaction partners. when the roles of hubs are not purely due to experimental bias, it is more likely to retain biologically relevant information by modelling it probabilistically than by simple filtering. gimf has an interesting correspondence with a log-odd score based approach. however, an important difference is gimf performs a global search of a subgraph with best cohesiveness based on a seed. the computation of gimf is highly efficient. it is well suited for building motifs around a subset of genes of interest with several choices of stringency.
