BACKGROUND
cytokines generate and maintain host responses to microbial infection. living cells of the host secrete these molecules as paracrine or autocrine signals to recruit cells of the immune system , produce inflammation , or control the inflammatory responses . the fine-tuned cytokine networks facilitate the eradication of invading microbes but maintain a balance between pro- and anti-inflammation thereby creating a favorable environment for tissue repair  <cit> .

dental caries and subsequent tooth pulp inflammation are major oral health problems caused by bacterial infection. previous studies have reported increased expression of various cytokines in caries-affected dental pulp and/or odontoblasts including transforming growth factor-β <dig> , vascular endothelial cell growth factor , c-c chemokine ligand  <dig> , ccl20/mip3α, interleukin  <dig> , cxc chemokine ligand  <dig> , epithelial cell-derived neutrophil attractant  <dig> , il-1β, il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  interferon-γ  and tumor necrotic factor-α   <cit> . the induction of these cytokines was also shown in cultured pulp-derived fibroblasts and odontoblast-like cells exposed to bacteria or their products in vitro  <cit> . however, these molecular events induced in odontoblast layer  have not been characterized or distinguished from those of the underlying pulp during the carious process in vivo.

like osteoblasts and other blast cells, the primary function of odontoblasts is generally understood as producing the extracellular structure of dentin. the functional response of odontoblasts to caries is recognized as extending a barrier to the spread of infection by forming reparative dentin. recently our group and others showed that odontoblasts can also mediate host inflammatory responses to caries directly through production of antimicrobial peptides and cytokines, and indirectly through activation of migratory immune cells using in vitro and ex vivo models  <cit> . in this study we aim to characterize cytokine expression profiles generated within human teeth in response to dental caries in vivo, and to build a mechanistic model of these responses by mapping the in vivo differential gene expression of odl and pulp in healthy  and diseased  teeth across known protein interactions.

we assessed the tooth inflammatory regulatory network as the combined response of cells in odl and pulp to dental caries in vivo. first we described gene expression profiling of cytokines and related immune components in odl and pulp of normal teeth. second we analyzed expression changes in carious teeth using cdna microarrays and verified with quantitative real-time pcr. additional gene transcripts with significant changes in carious teeth were identified by real-time pcr arrays. we mapped the connectivity between differentially expressed gene transcripts onto a network of experimentally demonstrated protein interactions. the reconstructed interaction network between differentially expressed gene products suggested that odl amplifies responses through self-feedback cycling of signal-receptor events, building the capacity to dramatically increase cytokine and antimicrobial peptide production to protect the tooth and contain the battle against oral pathogens within the dentin.

in normal teeth, mrna expression of most genes was higher in the pulp, although expression was higher in odl for the following genes : il1r <dig>  mif, toll-interacting protein , transcription factor  <dig> or ccaat/enhancer binding protein beta , b-cell lymphoma  <dig> , iceberg caspase- <dig> inhibitor , il5rα/il5ra, il <dig>  and osteopentin . c-c family chemokine receptor  <dig>  mrna was detected in the pulp but not in odl.

caries-induced inflammatory gene expression in odl and underlying pulp
a profound increase in expression of inflammatory genes in carious teeth examined here occurred in odl mainly, while fewer differences were found for the pulp, as shown by cdna arrays  and real-time pcr . cdna arrays showed increased expression of  <dig> genes in odl while  <dig> genes were up-regulated in the pulp . up-regulation of ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and tnfa in odl of carious teeth was confirmed by qpcr . while cdna arrays failed to detect any changes of these genes in the pulp of carious teeth, qpcr revealed significant increases of ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccr <dig>  and ccl <dig> . similarly, qpcr detected significant increases of il-1β/il1b, tnf-α/tnfa, and lta in both odl and pulp of carious teeth but cdna arrays only revealed significant increases of il-1β/il1b and lta in the pulp and tnf-α/tnfa in odl of carious teeth . the qpcr verification data are consistent with those from pcr arrays.

as mentioned above, il1r <dig>  mif, cxcl <dig>  and cxcl <dig> presented the most abundant expression in odl and pulp of normal teeth. in carious teeth, mif and il1r <dig> decreased slightly in odl as shown by cdna arrays  and qpcr . however, these changes were not significant. the expression of cxcl <dig> was not significantly altered in odl and pulp of carious teeth. only cxcl <dig> significantly increased in the pulp but not odl of carious teeth .

among chemokines, pro-inflammatory, and anti-inflammatory mediators as well as their receptors examined in this study, the atp-binding cassette subfamily f member  <dig>  was the most highly up-regulated gene in odl of carious teeth. this gene was not detected in either odl or the pulp of normal teeth. abcf <dig> expression did not change in the pulp of carious teeth . other inflammatory mediators differentially regulated in odl and pulp of carious teeth are shown in figure  <dig> 

protective production of antimicrobial peptides induced by pro-inflammatory mediators increased in odl of carious teeth
we examined the effects of il-1β/il1b, tnf-α/tnfa, ifnγ/ifng, and tlr <dig> activation on antimicrobial peptide production using in vitro cultured human odontoblast-like cells. the protein products of these genes are major inducers of pulpal inflammation and are well known to regulate production of other cytokines.

pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1β and tnf-α but not ifnγ up-regulated mrna transcription of human β-defensin  <dig>  in a similar manner to tlr <dig> activation . the magnitude change of hbd <dig> up-regulation by il-1β  was much more robust than those induced by tnf-α  and bacterial lps . hbd <dig> transcription was also increased in odl of carious teeth . hbd <dig> gene transcription slightly increased in the presence of il-1β  and in odl of carious teeth . hbd <dig> mrna slightly increased in the presence of ifnγ . however, the gene transcription of hbd <dig> was not significantly changed in odl and pulp of carious teeth .

model of caries signal induction
the gene expression analysis findings suggest cell-cell interaction events mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides that are predicted to build the immune defense capacity within odl to protect the tooth and contain the battle against oral pathogens in dentin .

mapping of caries-induced molecular interactions for odl inflammatory responses
a model of the downstream molecular mechanisms and resulting cellular responses to dental caries in odl was built by integrating the differential gene expression profile with previously defined functional interactions and signaling pathways .

a few receptors receive the signal of abundant ligands, and are themselves abundant in odl of carious teeth including il1r <dig>  il8rα, il8rβ, il9r, il13rα <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  and ccr <dig>  the dramatic increase of either receptors or ligands in odl  but not in the pulp  of carious teeth suggests: 1) signals through these receptors are critical to initiate inflammatory events within odl, and 2) the propagation of these signals into the pulp may lead to the development of irreversible pulpitis in carious teeth.

the global downstream signaling network from bacterial signals and host cytokines, via their receptors and signaling molecules, to the transcription factor activation and consequence cellular responses is shown in figure  <dig>  some of these responses are features related to the classic pulp pathologic progression from infection  to inflammation and to necrosis, including cytokine production, inflammatory cell migration, nitric oxide production, proteolysis, cell lysis, and apoptosis. other responses include the convergence of many pathways onto pik3r <dig>  and pik3ca , suggesting that modulation of phosphatidylinositol phosphorylation by these proteins could present a mechanism to control the inflammatory responses.

discussion
odontoblasts form the peripheral layer of the dental pulp as an internal host-microbial interface for the tooth, and thus are vulnerable and need the capability of innate host defenses  <cit> . cytokines and chemokines mediate the crosstalk between odontoblasts and cells of the innate immune system such as neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. these proteins are secreted by both odontoblasts and immune cells in response to bacterial stimuli to attract additional immune cells as well as initiate and modulate inflammatory responses. here we propose a mechanistic model of cytokine-signaling network in the odontoblast layer  of human teeth in response to dental caries and the role of il1r <dig> and ligands il-1β and il-1α in carrying the converged inflammatory signals to amplify innate immune responses including the production of antimicrobial peptides to protect the tooth and contain the battle against carious bacteria within dentin. we also show that cells in odl of normal and carious teeth expressed mrna for various immune components of which the majority measured here are chemotactic cytokines. in response to carious infection, these cytokines are highly up-regulated in odl and most likely induce leukocyte migration into the tooth to increase immunologic capacity. this finding is supported by previous data in vitro that protein secretions from odontoblast-like cells exposed to bacterial products induced migration of monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells  <cit> .

our findings of active immune components in healthy teeth expand upon previous findings. one study using healthy teeth reported mrna expression of tgfα/tgfa, ccr <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and cxcl <dig> only in odl, and ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and ltb gene expression only in the pulp  <cit> . conversely, in this study we found expression of all these markers in both odl and underlying pulp of normal teeth. other studies reported mrna expression of ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  il8rβ/il8rb, ltb4r, and scye <dig> in cultured human odontoblast-like cells  <cit> , which matches our in vivo results from odl of normal teeth.

odontoblasts recognize carious bacteria and initiate immune responses through toll-like receptors   <cit> . tgfβ <dig> was shown to attenuate odontoblast inflammatory responses by inhibiting tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> expression, which maintain homeostasis within the tooth during carious infection  <cit> . we also noticed other tlr signal antagonists in the tooth including toll-interacting protein  and il <dig>  <cit> . high expression of tollip in odl can provide a negative feedback loop for tlr-mediated inflammation to protect the underlying pulp. il <dig> and receptors, il10rα/il10ra and il10rβ/il10rb were present in odl and pulp. il <dig> was highly up-regulated in odl of carious teeth  and provides another mechanism to attenuate pulp inflammatory responses.

our hypothesis that odl is the primary biologic unit of immune responses in the tooth is supported by the profound increase in expression of many inflammatory genes within odl but not in the pulp. as we do not assess any of the cell types alone, this immune modulatory tissue includes odontoblasts and immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. these responses are mediated by cell-to-cell interactions within odl, and imply differences between in vitro and in vivo responses to carious bacteria. our findings together suggest that odl is effective in attenuating carious infections thereby limiting the inflammatory changes within odl and maintaining the pulp in a relatively protected environment.

in the presence of bacteria, odontoblasts secrete various chemotactic cytokines for neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, immature dendritic cells, and lymphocytes including interleukin  <dig> , chemokine  ligand  <dig> , ccl <dig>  chemokine  ligand  <dig> , and cxcl <dig>  <cit> . similarly we found up-regulation of these genes in odl of carious teeth. cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> mrna also increased in the pulp tissues of carious teeth but ccl <dig> slightly decreased.

other chemokines increased in odl of carious teeth are ccl <dig>  ccl3- <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl15- <dig>  ccl19- <dig>  ccl23- <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl9- <dig>  and cxcl <dig>  the resulting gradient of these chemokines attracts more migration of immune cells into the tooth  <cit> . the migratory immune cells, in particular monocytes/macrophages, release a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1β, tnf-α, il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  which regulate inflammatory reactions in the tissue  <cit> . we previously showed that human odontoblasts increased transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines, il-1β and tnf-α in response to bacterial infection in vitro  <cit> . here we show that these pro-inflammatory cytokines and others including crp, abcf <dig>  il <dig>  lta, ltb, il1a, il17c, il1f <dig>  and il <dig>  were also increased in odl of carious teeth in vivo.

we attempted to identify candidate signal propagators by mapping caries-induced expression of inflammatory mediators onto an experimentally verified set of protein interactions. network analysis shows il1r <dig> standing out as a possible early amplifier of the caries signal, as one of the most abundantly expressed genes in odl with or without caries induction . the well known pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokine il1r <dig> agonists, il-1α and il-1β, are both highly expressed by cells in carious odl. il-1α is the third most up-regulated gene after abcf <dig> and lta . the signal propagation from il1r <dig> overlaps with the tlr4-activated nfkb pathway, suggesting direct signal amplification .

we demonstrate that activation of il1r <dig> by il-1β  may carry an important activation signal for innate immune responses, with the example of antimicrobial peptide production . the important role of il1r <dig> in protecting the tooth and surrounding bone from polymicrobial infection  was verified in vivo by using genetically modified il1r <dig> knockout mice. pulp tissues of teeth experimentally infected with mixed bacteria became necrotic faster and had greater bacterial invasion in il1r1-null mice than wild-type controls. further abscess formation and the loss of surrounding bone around infected teeth were shown to be greater in il1r1-null mice than wild-type controls  <cit> .

although cdna arrays showed a reduction of il1r <dig> in odl of carious teeth, qpcr data indicated that this change was very low and not statistically significant. we also observed similar result for tlr <dig> expression in odl of carious teeth . tlr <dig> activation amplifies inflammatory signaling through the activation and production of nf-κb, avoidance of atf <dig>  and cyclic activation of c/ebpδ  <cit> . while the levels of c/ebpδ, atf <dig>  and nf-kb control the il <dig> output, the supra-threshold level of tlr <dig> does not affect signal amplification. moreover, flux in tlr <dig> production would confuse c/ebpδ interpretation of a transient signal as a persistent signal. we present il1r <dig> as playing a similar role in inflammatory signal amplification to that of tlr <dig> 

abcf <dig>  the most highly upregulated gene in odl of carious teeth was mapped downstream of tnf-α and caspase  <dig>  this gene is regulated by tnf-α  <cit>  and cleaved by caspase  <dig>  <cit> . little is known about functions of this gene but it was shown to regulate protein synthesis  <cit> , inflammatory progression  <cit> , and apoptosis  <cit> . activation of initiator caspases including caspase  <dig> and  <dig> during apoptosis could result in the cleavage of abcf <dig> and subsequent regulation of apoptotic signaling. the dramatic up-regulation of abcf <dig> in odl of carious teeth may prime the surrounding cells of the odl for necrosis.

the signaling pathways from tlr <dig>  tgfβ, chemokine, interleukin, and tnf receptors were mediated through various signaling molecules such as myd <dig>  ikk, traf, smad, map kinase, jak/stat, and caspases with high interactions and cross-talk among these signaling pathways. output from this network includes various aggregate cellular responses including the convergence of many pathways onto pik3r <dig>  and pik3ca , suggesting that modulation of phosphatidylinositol- <dig> kinase  activity by these proteins could present a mechanism to control the inflammatory responses. consistent with this hypothesis, inhibition of pi3k in odontoblast-like cells exposed to carious bacteria  significantly reduced the transcription of inflammatory cytokines il <dig> and il <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
cells in the odontoblast layer initiate immunologic responses of the tooth to dental caries through proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine signaling. the model we propose for this cytokine interaction network suggests multiple candidate mediators of signal propagation to irreversible inflammatory damage. the cytokine signaling network reported here provides a map to guide future studies to identify diagnostic or therapeutic targets for pulpal inflammation.
