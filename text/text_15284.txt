BACKGROUND
balamuthiasis is a disease of humans and a variety of mammalian species caused by the free-living amoeba balamuthia mandrillaris  <cit> . its most important clinical manifestation is balamuthia amoebic encephalitis , also described as granulomatous amebic encephalitis , in both immunocompromized hosts and in individuals apparently without immunological deficits  <cit> . b. mandrillaris is exquisitely encephalotropic and cytopathic  <cit> , causing extensive brain tissue damage  <cit> . with worldwide around  <dig> identified cases to date  <cit> , bae is rare, however, with only  <dig> documented survivors  <cit> , exceedingly lethal. due to lack of practical experience, amoebic encephalitis is often mistaken for a brain tumour, viral or bacterial encephalitis, tuberculoma, or neurocysticercosis  <cit> . there exist no characteristic clinical symptoms, nor laboratory, or radiological findings diagnostic of bae  <cit> . the high percentage of fatal bae cases is also due to the high frequency of misdiagnosis and subsequent false, possibly even exacerbating, treatment strategies. at the moment, a proper diagnosis is possible only at autopsy, which is seldom done in most countries. conversely, bae is most likely severely under-diagnosed and thus reviewed by some authors as a genuine emerging  <cit>  or at least potentially threatening  <cit>  parasitic infection.

b. mandrillaris amoebae have recently been detected in soils both in the close vicinity of and distant from a bae case  <cit> . inhalation of contaminated dust or wounding contact with contaminated soils are the likely sources of infection. while infections of the skin and lungs may prevail for months, the infection of the central nervous system  can result in death in a matter of days  <cit> . as patients generally present first with neurological symptoms indicating that the cns is already affected, rapid and dependable diagnosis is an absolutely prerequisite for any successful therapy.

until recently, diagnosis of bae relied on microscopical analysis of brain tissue , with indirect immunofluorescence  microscopy as the favoured detection method  <cit> . apart from specific antiserum, this requires appreciable expertise, and a tissue sample of sufficient quality. pcr-based methods have the advantage of requiring much less pathogen-specific experience and can therefore be easily added to the diagnostic panel of any laboratory equipped with the basic tools and know-how. in addition, they are potentially more sensitive and specific, and can analyse larger sample volumes. finally, they do not necessarily rely on intact pathogens and are more likely to detect an infection, i.e. pathogen-specific nucleic acid, in the blood or csf, enabling less invasive diagnostic procedures.

pcr-based methods are being increasingly used for detecting known pathogenic amoebae  <cit> . to date, b. mandrillaris pcrs generally target ribosomal rna  gene sequences  <cit> . even when quantification is not necessary, real-time pcr should be given preference over conventional pcr whenever possible, as the omission of post-amplification handling leads to quicker results and reduces the risk of amplicon contamination  <cit> . to identify false-positive results due to cross-reactivity and to ensure that novel variants or mutants in the target gene do not lead to false-negative results, the identification of microorganisms by pcr should involve the detection of at least  <dig> independent areas of the pathogen's genome in parallel. this becomes increasingly important with the microorganisms pathogenicity, when misdiagnosis bears grave consequences  <cit> . accordingly, a real-time pcr assay was established specifically targeting the rnase p gene  <cit>  of b. mandrillaris and tested in normal and spiked cell cultures, organ samples and patient material. furthermore, this new assay was compared to a recently published real-time pcr targeting an 18s rrna gene sequence of b. mandrillaris  <cit> , and a duplex assay combining both was performed for optimal specificity and reliability.

RESULTS
the aim of this communication is to introduce a real-time pcr-based assay for detecting infections with b. mandrillaris amoebae with maximum specificity, sensitivity, and reliability. for this, a partial rnase p gene sequence, published in genbank, was found containing a region specific for b. mandrillaris as demonstrated by basic local alignment search tool  analysis. pcr primers and a taqman probe were designed as described in materials and methods. the enzyme rnase p is responsible for generating the mature 5'-end of trna by a single endonucleolytic cleavage of their precursors. it is an essential, ubiquitous enzyme present in all cells and cellular compartments that synthesize trna: bacterial cells, archaea, eukaryotic nuclei, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. all known rnase p enzymes are ribonucleoproteins containing an rna subunit essential for catalysis  <cit> . eukaryotic rnase p rna contains a conserved core structure as well as regions of highly variable length and structure  <cit> .

the ability of the designed rnase p primer set to detect b. mandrillaris dna was evaluated with trophozoites  from axenic culture. in more than  <dig> experiments, less than  <dig> b. mandrillaris amoebae equivalents were dependably detected, in individual experiments down to  <dig> . the rnase p primer set did not react with ≥  <dig> pg dna from  <dig> different acanthamoeba species, other protozoa or mycobacteria, nor did it react with mammalian tissues or cell lines. it did, however, detect b. mandrillaris dna in murine tissues spiked with b. mandrillaris amoebae . the genus acanthamoeba is closely related to balamuthia  <cit>  and 25-fold polyploid  <cit> . assuming that a single b. mandrillaris cell contains  <dig> copies of the rnase p gene, a sensitivity limit of  <dig> amoebae or  <dig> gene copies seems reasonable.

a) minimal amounts of total dna giving positive results . b) minimal numbers of amoebae  giving positive results; neg = ct ≥  <dig> for at least  <dig> ng total dna. c) range of ct values measured; neg = ct ≥  <dig> or no dna detected; n.d. = not done.

to establish assay sensitivity in the presence of host tissue, pieces of murine brain tissue were spiked with graded numbers of b. mandrillaris from axenic cultures  and rnase p and 18s rrna genes dna detected in parallel by duplex real-time pcr. as show in fig 1a, down to  <dig>  amoeba equivalents could be detected when targeting both rnase p and 18s rrna genomic dna.

our results targeting the rnase p gene revealed a similar sensitivity as those published by qvarnstrom and colleagues for the 18s rrna gene in a triplex real-time pcr  <cit> . in direct comparison , however, the 18s rrna gene primer set  regularly was more sensitive by  <dig>  to  <dig> cycles than the rnase p gene primer set . the 18s rrna gene is 24-fold repetitive in a. castellanii  <cit> . assuming b. mandrillaris to be 25-fold polyploid, one cell would contain  <dig> copies of the 18s rrna gene. a 10-fold difference in gene copies normally results in a difference in sensitivity by 2– <dig> cycles in the real-time pcr. thus the assumed 24-fold surplus of 18s rrna genes per cell might well explain the somewhat lower sensitivity of the rnase p gene primer set.

these promising in vitro results encouraged testing stored material from experimentally infected animals. for example, a brain necropsy specimen that had been kept frozen at -70°c for over  <dig> years from an intranasally infected mouse that had shown neurological symptoms of bae before death, and whose brains had been found to be infected with b. mandrillaris amoeba by iif microscopy, also gave positive results by real-time pcr . all specimens from noninfected mouse brains were negative.

a) a highly symptomatic cd4+ t cell-deficient mouse  <dig> days post intranasal infection with b. mandrillaris amoebae. b) dna extracted from  <dig> fresh bae-patient brain biopsy samples . c) minimal amounts of total dna giving positive results . d) minimal numbers of amoebae  giving positive results; neg = ct ≥  <dig> for at least  <dig> ng total dna. e) range of ct values measured; neg = ct ≥  <dig> or no dna detected; n.d. = not done.

next, the real-time pcr assay was applied to fresh brain biopsy specimens from a tumor patient without or with added b. mandrillaris amoebae. human brain tissue had no effect on the assay, as it neither produced false negative results nor inhibited the detection of b. mandrillaris dna . finally, dna from brain biopsies of  <dig> bae patients  <cit>   were tested positive for b. mandrillaris rnase p genes . highly similar results were achieved with a second primer set batch, this time using cy5/bhq- <dig> for dye/quencher . no differences in assay sensitivity were detected between b. mandrillaris dna from human or baboon bae cases, supporting the concept of a single genotype for b. mandrillaris  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this taqman real-time pcr assay using a primer set designed to target a b. mandrillaris-specific region of the rnase p gene, detects b. mandrillaris genomes in amoeba cultures, spiked tissues, and infected brain tissue with high specificity and sensitivity. in direct comparison with a published primer set that targets the 18s rrna gene of b. mandrillaris, this assay is somewhat less sensitive, which can be explained by the different expected genome numbers per cell of the respective target genes. both primer sets were successfully combined in a duplex real-time pcr assay to ensure maximum specificity and as a precaution against false negative results.
