BACKGROUND
carotenoids are natural pigments of yellow, orange or red color. more than  <dig> different chemical structures have been described to date  <cit> . they are terpenoids with the isopentenyl- pyrophosphate  molecule as the basic unit. astaxanthin is a carotenoid with a high commercial interest due to its use as a food additive for trout and salmon flesh pigmentation in aquaculture  <cit> . its biosynthesis is limited to a few microorganisms such as the microalgae haematococcus pluvialis and the basidiomycete yeast xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous  <cit> .

the first step in the biosynthesis of astaxanthin in x. dendrorhous is the isomerization of ipp into dimethylallyl pyrophosphate  by ipp isomerase, which is encoded by the idi gene  <cit> . three ipp molecules are sequentially added to one dmapp molecule, where the ggpp synthase  is involved, forming geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate   <cit> . then, the condensation of two ggpp molecules produces phytoene, which corresponds to the first carotenoid synthesized in the pathway. this step is catalyzed by a bi-functional enzyme called phytoene-β-carotene synthase , which also has lycopene cyclase activity and is encoded by the crtyb gene  <cit> . subsequently, phytoene goes through four successive desaturation reactions, catalyzed by the phytoene desaturase enzyme , producing lycopene  <cit> . then, both lycopene ends are cyclized by the lycopene cyclase activity of the bi-functional pbs enzyme, forming β-carotene.

in the last step for the formation of astaxanthin from β-carotene, two enzymatic activities are required, ketolase, to incorporate a keto group in positions  <dig> and 4' of β-carotene, and hydroxylase, to introduce a hydroxyl group at positions  <dig> and 3' of β-carotene  <cit> . unlike other organisms, where two independent genes are needed for this step, in x. dendrorhous a single crts gene has been isolated that encodes an astaxanthin synthase which can probably perform both activities  <cit> . however, it has been suggested that crts may require an auxiliary enzyme for the formation of astaxanthin from β-carotene  <cit> . the deduced crts amino acid sequence strongly suggests that the x. dendrorhous enzyme belongs to the cytochrome p <dig> protein family  <cit> .

cytochrome p <dig> enzymes require an electron donor for the addition of oxygen-bearing functional groups to a substrate. in eukaryotes, this electron donor is cytochrome p <dig> reductase , encoded by the cpr gene  <cit> . although several genes for different cytochrome p <dig> enzymes can exist in an organism, in most species only one cpr gene exists. some exceptions have been observed in plants and zygomycetes that contain two or three cpr genes  <cit> .

in another study, an escherichia coli strain was transformed with three compatible plasmids. the first plasmid contained the necessary genes for the synthesis of β-carotene, the second contained the x. dendrorhous crts gene, and the third contained the saccharomyces cerevisiae cpr gene  <cit> . through this system, it was possible to obtain oxygenated β-carotene derivatives, but not astaxanthin, suggesting the need for an appropriate cpr to complement the astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway. prior to this study, a x. dendrorhous gene encoding for a cpr for astaxanthin biosynthesis had not been isolated. this paper describes for the first time the sequence of the x. dendrorhous crtr gene and its encoded polypeptide. moreover, our results reveal that the crtr gene product is essential for astaxanthin biosynthesis in x. dendrorhous.

RESULTS
cloning of crtr gene
three cytochrome p <dig> reductase genes were used for primer design: from the zygomycete cunninghamella echinulata , the ascomycete saccharomyces cerevisiae  and the basidiomycete rhodotorula minuta . based on the conserved dna segments, degenerate primers were designed . pcr reactions were performed using genomic dna from ucd 67– <dig> x. dendrorhous as a template and different combinations of forward and reverse primers. an amplicon of  <dig>  kb was obtained when pcr reactions were performed with primers cpr <dig> and cpr <dig>  this amplicon was completely sequenced and was found to be homologous to cpr genes by blast analysis. we named this gene crtr and designed specific crtr primers.

the yip <dig> genomic library was screened for the x. dendrorhous crtr gene by pcr  <cit> , and one recombinant plasmid carrying the crtr gene  was isolated. this plasmid contained a dna insert of approximately  <dig>  kb, carrying six bamhi fragments of  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb ,  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb. each fragment was sub-cloned into the pbluescript sk- vector for sequencing. the sequence analysis showed that the crtr gene was in one end of the  <dig>  kb fragment , but it was incomplete. the promoter region and part of the first exon were missing due to the presence of a bamhi site in the crtr gene.

a cdna library was screened for the x. dendrorhous crtr cdna, and a recombinant plasmid, pcxda. <dig> , was isolated, which contained a  <dig>  bp insert corresponding to the cdna of the crtr gene . we used this cdna sequence for specific primer design  from the remaining crtr gene sequence, and this allowed the isolation of the ppr <dig> aa. <dig> plasmid from the yip <dig> genomic library. ppr <dig> aa. <dig> contains the promoter and 5' region of the first exon of the crtr gene. sequence analysis indicated that the 5' region of the crtr gene is at one end of the  <dig>  kb bamhi dna fragment.

the in silico dna sequence analysis of the inserts from ppr <dig> aa. <dig> and ppr <dig> p. <dig> indicated that the crtr gene is entirely contained in a  <dig>  kb sali dna fragment. this result was corroborated by southern blot hybridization . the recombinant plasmid pcprb. <dig>  which contains an insert of  <dig>  bp that harbors the crtr gene, was isolated from a partial sali genomic library. the complete crtr gene sequence  is displayed in figure  <dig> 

localization of the crtr gene in the yeast electrophoretic karyotype
to study the crtr gene's genomic organization, its localization in the electrophoretic karyotype of the ucd 67– <dig> strain was performed by southern blot hybridization. the results showed that the crtr gene is in the first two chromosomal bands , where each band corresponds to a triplet  <cit> . as it was recently demonstrated that this strain is diploid  <cit> , it is possible to conclude that the crtr gene is in at least two chromosomes and could be homologous polymorphic. in different x. dendrorhous strains, a high chromosomal polymorphism has been revealed  <cit> , so it is possible that these homologous chromosomes have experienced genetic rearrangement, thus explaining their different sizes.

sequence analysis of crtr gene
the crtr gene consists of three exons of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp and two introns of  <dig> and  <dig> bp. this gene encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein  with a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. crtr has  <dig> hydrophobic amino acids in its amino terminal region, a typical transmembrane segment of known cprs that anchors the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in the cell  <cit> . crtr also has recognizable cpr conserved domains such as a fmn binding domain, a fad binding domain between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  and a nadh binding domain between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  the flavodoxin signature, which is only found in certain bacteria and algae, was identified between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  however, the fmn binding domain of cprs is homologous to bacterial flavodoxins  <cit> . two putative p450-binding regions  have been suggested  <cit> , and one  was studied by site-directed mutagenesis in rat cpr where the importance of acidic amino acid residues in this region was demonstrated  <cit> . the corresponding regions in crtr were characterized by the presence of acidic amino acids . the aspartic acid residues at position  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are extremely conserved in all known cprs  <cit> . the p <dig> binding regions are located in the fmn binding domain. this is consistent with the electron flow from nadh to fad to fmn and finally to the cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase enzyme.

a phylogenetic comparison was performed using available fungal cpr protein sequences in the database by the neighbor joining method after  <dig> replications of bootstrap analysis . the phylogenetic tree shows the evolutionary relationship of crtr and allows the differentiation of three fungal clusters: basidomycota, ascomycota and zygomycota. crtr from x. dendrorhous is most closely related to the basidomycetes c. versicolor and to p. chrysosporium, with sequence identities of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.

expression of crtr gene
the relationship between the crts and crtr gene expression along the growth curve at the mrna level was studied in the wild type ucd 67– <dig> x. dendrorhous strain, grown in mmv supplemented with glucose as a fermentable carbon source. it was observed that crts mrna level reaches a maximum at  <dig> h of cultivation, equivalent to approximately half of the exponential growth phase. however, the levels of crtr mrna remained constant along the growth curve . despite the fact that both proteins are involved in the same stage of astaxanthin biosynthesis, there is no relationship, at the mrna level, in their gene expression. it is possible to conclude that the two genes are not regulated in the same way at the transcriptional level.

according to this last result, in other work done in our laboratory, a dramatic decrease of transcripts levels from the crtyb, crti and crts genes  was observed during the stationary phase  <cit> . this was not the case for the idi and crte genes, where the level of the idi transcript showed a slight decline and the crte transcript remained constant during the stationary phase. this suggests the presence of higher levels of the enzymes ipp isomerase and ggpp synthase at this stage. this situation would allow for the flow of the isoprenoid precursors towards carotenoid biosynthesis, as well as other metabolic pathways such as ergosterol biosynthesis  <cit> . similarly, the absence of a relationship between the pattern of crtr gene expression and the rest of the carotenogenic genes suggests the existence of a different regulatory mechanism for crtr gene expression due to its involvement in other metabolic pathways of the yeast.

an example of cpr gene regulation has been described for aspergillus niger. in this case, it was observed that the regulation of cpr gene expression was particularly complex in the p450-cpr system involved in benzoate hydroxylation  <cit> . in addition to benzoate induction at the transcriptional level, there were other regulatory mechanisms such as differential promoter use and post-translational regulatory mechanisms  <cit> . the decoupling of a p450-cpr system would imply the release of electrons to the cytoplasm that could generate active oxygen molecules, so a strict regulation of cpr is of vital importance for the cell. similarly, it is not surprising that the crts and crtr genes are regulated differently because, as mentioned earlier, several genes for different cytochrome p <dig> enzymes can exist in an organism, but generally there is a single gene for a unique cytochrome p <dig> reductase. therefore, complex regulation for crtr protein expression is necessary to adjust the levels of cytochrome p <dig> reductase activity in a cell with different levels of diverse cytochrome p <dig> proteins.

functional study of the crtr gene
the participation of the crtr gene product in the formation of astaxanthin from β-carotene was studied in a bacterial heterologous system. for this, the ds1b e. coli strain  was transformed with a pet101/d-topo expression vector carrying the cdna of crts and crtr genes from x. dendrorhous, and the carotenoid production was analyzed by rp-hplc. this system was not successful, as it was not possible to produce any xanthophylls in the bacteria. a similar situation was observed in another study, where only canthaxanthin  in very small quantities was produced when the s. cerevisiae cpr gene was used  <cit> . these authors concluded that the x. dendrorhous astaxanthin synthase has very low activity in e. coli  <cit> . it should be noted that the p <dig> systems are associated with membranes; therefore, e. coli may not provide a proper environment for its functionality. recently, it was reported that several attempts to produce carotenoids in e. coli using the x. dendrorhous carotenogenic genes resulted in poor enzyme expression and carotenoid production  <cit> . hence, a eukaryotic system would be more appropriate to attempt the expression of x. dendrorhous carotenogenic genes.

as the e. coli expression system was not successful, in order to demonstrate the importance of the crtr gene in the astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway, x. dendrorhous crtr deletion mutant strains were generated. the wild type strains ucd 67– <dig> and cbs- <dig> were transformed with the linearized plasmid pbsiwiΔcrtr::hph and circular plasmid pndeiΔcrtr::hph, respectively. through homologous recombination events, the wild type crtr gene in the wild type strains was exchanged by the dna fragment containing the deletion and resistance marker .

through this experiment, a yellow  and a pale red-orange  hygromycin b resistant transformant strains were obtained. the color phenotype of these transformants is an indicator of an alteration in astaxanthin biosynthesis because astaxanthin has a strong red-orange color. the strain ucd 67– <dig> is diploid  <cit> ; therefore, we suggest that t <dig> is heterozygote for the crtr gene, with a mutant and a wild type allele. moreover, by a gene-dose effect, t <dig> produces less astaxanthin and accumulates more β-carotene than its parental wild type strain. on the other hand, the ploidy level of cbs- <dig> is unknown. however, based on random mutagenesis results with physical and chemical mutagens performed in our laboratory  and transformation with carotenogenic genes  <cit> , it was concluded that this strain could be haploid. the mutagenesis results suggest that, in the case of cbstr, the only crtr gene copy is mutated and, therefore, it is not capable of producing astaxanthin and accumulates β-carotene.

in order to confirm the t <dig>  and cbstr  transformant genotype modifications, pcr reactions were performed using specific primers for the crtr and hph genes , and genomic dna samples from wild type and transformant strains were used as templates. the amplicon sequences validated the representation shown in figure  <dig>  the results indicated that the cbs- <dig> strain has one crtr gene copy and its deletion is not lethal. in the case of t <dig>  it was shown that it is heterozygote for the crtr gene, having a wild type and a mutant allele, which supports the gene-dose effect hypothesis in the production of astaxanthin. these results were also corroborated by southern blot hybridization .

several attempts were performed to obtain a β-carotene accumulating transformant derived from ucd 67– <dig>  t <dig> was retransformed with a dna fragment harboring a crtr gene deletion and a g <dig> resistance cassette marker. no g <dig> resistant transformants were obtained. in order to produce a homozygous crtr mutation, t <dig> was subjected to the double recombinant method  <cit> , but it was not possible to obtain a double mutant strain for the crtr gene.

the cpr gene deletion in s. cerevisiae was not lethal, suggesting the existence of an alternative electron donor such as a cytochrome b <dig>   <cit> . when a cytb <dig> deletion in the wild type was done, no new phenotype was generated. however, it was lethal when cytb <dig> and cpr were simultaneously disrupted. this result demonstrated that, in mutants with single disruptions of cpr or cytb <dig>  both enzymes can complement each other  <cit> . likewise, the disruption of the cpr gene from the fungus gibberella fujikuroi was not lethal, proving the existence of another electron donor  <cit> . in light of these results and evidence for the existence of a high level of polymorphisms in different x. dendrorhous strains  <cit> , we suggest that both wild type strains may have a different genetic background. moreover, the results obtained in this work suggest that, in the cbs- <dig> wild type strain, an alternative electron donor such as a cytochrome b <dig> may exist because the crtr gene disruption was not lethal. on the other hand, this is not the case for the ucd 67– <dig> strain due to the impossibility to obtain a homozygous mutant for the crtr gene. however, the possible alternative electron donor in the cbs- <dig> strain cannot support astaxanthin synthesis, as the crtr gene mutant  accumulates β-carotene.

to check the carotenoid composition, total pigments were extracted from both wild type and transformant strains, and the composition was analyzed by rp-hplc . the rp-hplc analysis showed that the carotenoid composition is completely different between transformants and their parental strain. cbstr accumulates β-carotene and is unable to synthesize astaxanthin. t <dig> has a reduced astaxanthin production at the expense of increased β-carotene production, which is the astaxanthin precursor.

CONCLUSIONS
a new crtr gene has been isolated and characterized from x. dendrorhous, which plays an auxiliary role to the crts gene and is also essential for astaxanthin biosynthesis. this gene consists of three exons, and is localized in at least two chromosomes of the ucd 67– <dig> x. dendrorhous wild type strain. crtr encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein with characteristic domains of cytochrome p <dig> reductases h binding domains) and a small amino terminal transmembrane region. although both crts and crtr proteins participate in the same stage of yeast carotenogenesis, the mrna level pattern from these genes along the growth curve is different. thus, both genes are regulated in a different manner at the transcriptional level.
