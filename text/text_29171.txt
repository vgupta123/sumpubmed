BACKGROUND
segmentation along the rostro-caudal  axis is a fundamental characteristic of vertebrates. it originates during embryogenesis when the paraxial mesoderm is divided bilaterally into spheres of epithelial somites, which enclose a core of mesenchymal cells, the somitocoele cells  <cit> . each somite is divided in a rostral and caudal compartment with distinct gene expression and developmental fate  <cit> . this r/c somite polarity is established early on in the presomitic mesoderm  prior to segmentation  <cit>  and is essential for the subsequent resegmentation of sclerotomes  <cit>  and the sequential patterning of the neural tube  <cit> .

experimental evidence suggests that mesp <dig> and notch signalling are required for the initiation of r/c somite compartmentalisation in nascent somites through induction and suppression of dll <dig> expression in caudal and rostral somite halves, respectively  <cit> . the maintenance of somite r/c polarity requires the compartmentalised expression of caudal genes, such as dll <dig>  notch <dig>  paraxis and uncx <dig>   <cit> .

here, we analysed the requirement of restricted dll <dig> expression in epithelial somites for the maintenance of r/c identity following the initial establishment and for the development of somitocoele cells, in particular. it has been demonstrated that somitocoele cells contribute to proximal ribs, the articular surface of intervertebral  joints, and the peripheral parts of the intervertebral discs   <cit> . in the avian embryo, these cells constitute a joint forming compartment, the arthrotome  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms underlying the specification of the arthrotome compartment have not been studied. our data demonstrate that the over-expression of dll <dig> throughout epithelial somites of transgenic mice does not alter somite polarity but affects the development of intervertebral joints, ivds and proximal ribs. this suggests a role of restricted dll <dig> expression in caudal epithelial somites for arthrotome development.

RESULTS
generation of dll <dig> gain-of-function transgenic lines
to direct the expression of dll <dig> throughout somites including rostral somite compartments, a full length dll <dig> cdna under the control of the mesodermal specific cis-regulatory element  was fused to the dll <dig> minimal promoter  <cit>  . two independent and stable transgenic lines 1ieg and tg2ieg) were established by pronuclear injection. transgenic mice showed tails with multiple kinks and a reduction in tail and body length with varying severity . both transgenic lines exhibited comparable dysmorphologies of the axial skeleton with varying severity. 25% of the transgenic mice born had an externally visible alteration of the phenotype.  <dig> transgenic animals without externally visible transgenic phenotypes from both the transgenic lines were examined for morphological changes of the axial skeleton by x-ray imaging . abnormal bony fusions of vertebral bodies were found in the thoracic, lumbar and tail regions in  <dig> out of the  <dig> transgenic animals. vertebrae with reduced rostro-caudal length in the thoracic or tail regions were evident in  <dig> out of the  <dig> transgenic mice without externally visible phenotype. in  <dig> out of the  <dig> animals the number of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae was altered as compared to wild-type littermates and in  <dig> out of the  <dig> animals the number of sacral vertebrae was changed. neural arches were irregular  in  <dig> out of the  <dig> transgenic mice without externally visible phenotype changes. we did not find dysmorphologies of the vertebral column by x-ray imaging in one of the  <dig> transgenic animals. bones of limbs and skull were not affected in any of the transgenic animals. the shortening of the vertebral axis in adult transgenic mice with severe transgenic phenotype was due to frequent fusions of vertebral bodies from thoracic to caudal regions and a reduction of the r/c length of vertebrae caudal to the cervical region . thus, the dll <dig> overexpression phenotype was characterized by various dysmorphologies of the axial skeleton  with high penetrance but varying severity.

ectopic dll <dig> expression throughout somite epithelia
dll <dig> expression in wild-type and transgenic mouse embryos was examined from e <dig>  to e <dig>  by whole-mount rna in situ hybridisation. at e <dig>  no differences between wild-type and transgenic embryos were observed . ectopic dll <dig> expression in rostral halves of recently formed somites was first detected at e <dig>  in transgenic embryos when somitogenesis is initiated and has lasted at least until e <dig>  . variations in the expression level of the transgene were observed but did neither correlate with one of the transgenic lines nor with a specific stage of development. embryos from whole-mount in situ hybridisations were used for histological sections to determine dll <dig> expressing cells. in wild-type embryos at e <dig> , sections revealed significant staining in cells of the somitic epithelium of caudal somite halves . a weak staining was detected in the somitocoele adjacent to the caudal epithelium. in transgenic embryos, dll <dig> expression was also detected in epithelial cells but without restriction to caudal somite compartments . similar to wild-type embryos a weak staining was detected in the somitocoele.

epithelial somites appear normal in dll <dig> over-expressing embryos
histological sections of paraffin embedded embryos at e <dig>  revealed no differences between somites of wild-type and transgenic embryos . nascent somites developed a normal epithelial layer surrounding the somitocoele. the size of somites was identical in five age-matched pairs of transgenic and wild-type embryos between e <dig>  and e <dig>  in raster electron microscopic images . thus, the over-expression of dll <dig> in the paraxial mesoderm did not affect the early generation of somites with regards to epithelialisation, size and histological appearance at least until e <dig> .

we analysed the expression of various rostral and caudal somite marker genes and notch signalling targets by whole-mount in situ hybridisation of wild-type and transgenic embryos. from e <dig>  to e <dig>  we found no differences in the expression levels of dll <dig>  jag <dig>  notch <dig>  notch <dig>  lfng, uncx <dig> , hes <dig>  mesp <dig>  mesp <dig>  paraxis , pax <dig>  pax <dig>  myf <dig>  epha <dig>  myog and cer <dig>   <cit> . the r/c marker and notch pathway genes notch <dig>  notch <dig>  mesp <dig>  mesp <dig>  myf <dig>  uncx <dig> , pax <dig>  and pax <dig> were analysed until e <dig>  and did not reveal differential gene expression between transgenic and wild-type embryos . many of these genes also have dynamic patterns of expression in the psm. in accordance with the normal and regular epithelial somites observed, we did not find evidence for a change in phased gene expression in the psm of transgenic embryos in comparison to their wild-type littermates. in particular, the cyclic expression of lfng in the psm  <cit>  was not affected in tgieg embryos. distinct phases of lfng expression were evident in transgenic embryos at e <dig>  . homozygous tgieg mice were generated. dysmorphologies of the axial skeleton of these mice were not different from the dysmorphologies that were identified in heterozygous transgenic mice. we did, therefore, not undertake a gene expression analysis of homozygous transgenic embryos. we cannot exclude that even higher doses of ectopic dll <dig> signal in the psm may lead to a different phenotype with regards to cycling gene expression and the generation of r/c polarized epithelial somites.

dll <dig> over-expression affects intervertebral articulations and vertebrae morphology
since the contribution of distinct somitic regions to the elements of the axial skeleton has been rather well described  <cit> , we examined vertebrae morphology with the aim to identify those sclerotome and arthrotome derived cell types that contribute to malformed skeletal elements in dll <dig> transgenic mice. in alizarin red and alcian blue stained skeletons of transgenic mice we observed that structures derived from the somitocoele were frequently missing . in particular, costal heads of ribs were absent or strongly reduced in their thickness  and ivds were often missing resulting in the fusion of vertebral bodies . the articular processes of the neural arches were either missing in transgenic mice with strong phenotype  or reduced and malformed . despite the dysmorphologies of articular processes we did not observe fusions between adjacent neural arches even in transgenic animals with severe phenotype .

additional dysmorphologies in the axial skeleton of transgenic mice included split vertebral bodies with ectopic pseudo-growth plates  and open neural arches with missing spinous processes . pedicles and laminae of neural arches were always present and did not fuse between adjacent vertebrae .

developmental progression of axial dysmorphologies
to further characterise the loss of intervertebral joints and midline clefts of the axial skeleton, the developmental progression of this transgenic phenotype was monitored from e <dig>  to the newborn stage using alcian blue and alizarin red stainings . pairwise chondrocyte condensations of the presumptive axial skeleton adjacent to the notochord appeared normal in transgenic embryos at e <dig>  compared to wild-type littermates . in wild-type embryos at e <dig>  the pairs of cell condensations have come into contact at the axial midline. here they now form single, rather cylindrical cell condensations that periodically encircle the notochord . in transgenic embryos at e <dig>  pairs of cartilage condensations were not yet merged at the axial midline and regions between successive presumptive vertebrae stained with alcian blue . in wild-type embryos at e <dig>  morphogenesis had proceeded and a regular pattern of strongly alcian blue stained presumptive vertebral bodies and weaker stained presumptive ivds was evident . contrary, in transgenic embryos of the same age, the developing vertebral column stained uniformly with alcian blue . the extrusion of notochordal cells in transgenic embryos was incomplete such that the rod of axial mesoderm in the regions of vertebral bodies was thicker than in wild-type embryos . in vertebral bodies of newborn wild-type mice, alizarin red staining showed a single, central core of mineralised extracellular matrix . mineralisation had progressed also in the early neural arches and morphogenesis had resulted in the formation of superior and inferior articular processes forming the intervertebral joints. in contrast, transgenic newborn mice showed two mineralised cores lateral to the axial midline in each vertebral body . intervertebral discs were missing and adjacent vertebral bodies fused. superior and inferior articular processes were missing in the newborn transgenic mice with severe phenotype . thus, the loss of ivds and the failure of sclerotome cells to merge at the axial midline was traced back as early as e <dig>  in transgenic embryos.

in addition to altered cell differentiation of presumptive ivd cells in transgenic mice, we considered the possibility that the loss of ivd cells might result either from apoptosis of presumptive ivd cells or, alternatively, from over-proliferation of cells of the prospective vertebrae displacing future ivd cells. to analyze these alternatives, we performed bromodeoxyuridine  and tunel assays , e <dig>  ; tunel: e <dig>  , e <dig>  , e <dig>  , e <dig>   and e <dig>  ). no significant differences between wild-type and transgenic animals were observed in brdu  and in tunel assays .

dll <dig> over-expression affects chondrocyte hypertrophy and endochondral bone formation in vertebrae
we performed safranin o stainings on histological sections of paraffin embedded embryos to investigate cartilage development in prospective vertebral bodies . these stainings revealed fewer hypertrophic chondrocytes in vertebral bodies of transgenic rather than of wild-type embryos  . ossification had progressed normally at e <dig>  in wild-type animals but was delayed in transgenic embryos  and hypertrophic chondrocytes were dorsally displaced . rna in situ hybridisations to detect col10a <dig> gene expression, which is a marker for cells undergoing endochondral ossification  <cit> , also revealed fewer hypertrophic cells .

discussion
mouse dll <dig> expression in the psm and caudal somite halves, is necessary for the formation of epithelial somites and maintenance of caudal somite identity  <cit> . we established two transgenic mouse lines ieg) over-expressing dll <dig> in the paraxial mesoderm including rostral somite compartments under the control of the msd cis-regulatory element  <cit> . we investigated the role of restricted, compartmentalised dll <dig> expression for the maintenance of r/c somite identity and the morphogenesis of the axial skeleton. tgieg animals were viable and fertile. they developed normal epithelial somites and gene expression analysis on r/c marker genes revealed, that the uniform over-expression of dll <dig> throughout the somites was not sufficient to confer caudal compartment identity to rostral somite halves. nevertheless transgenic animals had at least three distinct phenotypic alterations of the vertebral column:  arthrotome related dysmorphologies,  midline defects and  a failure in chondrocyte maturation. in the following, we discuss the potential role of dll <dig> over-expression for these phenotypic traits and the requirement of caudally restricted dll <dig> expression for intervertebral joint formation.

somite formation and rostro-caudal polarity are not affected by dll <dig> over-expression
dll <dig> deficient embryos  showed severe patterning defects in the paraxial mesoderm and died before e <dig>   <cit> . in these mutants, the r/c pattern of somites was not established and maintained as in wild-type embryos and nascent somites did not epithelialise normally. the requirement of dll <dig> for the formation of the axial skeleton was also studied in a mouse model expressing a truncated and dominant-negative version of dll <dig>  under the control of the msd cis-regulatory element )  <cit> . in the axial skeleton such transgenic mice exhibited fusions of laminae of neural arches, reduction or loss of pedicles, split vertebral bodies as well as rostral homeotic transformations at the cervical-thoracic transition. gene expression analyses revealed a reduction of uncx <dig>  expression in caudal compartments and an expansion of the expression domain of the rostral somite marker gene tbx <dig>  these data suggested a partial loss of caudal somite compartment characteristics in tg animals. despite the fact that tgieg animals exhibited dysmorphologies of the axial skeleton, dll <dig> transgenic embryos did not display changes in r/c marker gene expression.

the midline defects in the axial skeleton, the vertebral fusions and dysmorphologies of ribs observed in tgieg animals were reminiscent of somitogenesis related phenotypes observed in other mutant mice. all of these mutant animals are, however, characterised by alterations of r/c marker gene expression. for example, the bilateral centres of ossification in the vertebral bodies of paraxis  <cit> , dll <dig>  <cit>  and psen <dig>  <cit>  deficient mice as well as missing spinous processes in uncx <dig> -/-  <cit>  and dll <dig> deficient skeletons resemble the midline defects found in the dll <dig> over-expressing mice. proximal rib malformations and/or rib fusions occur consistently in paraxis, psen <dig>  dll <dig> and uncx <dig>  as well as in the dll <dig> over-expressing transgenic mice. fusions of vertebral bodies or precursors along the r/c axis and the loss of ivds as described for tgieg animals were also found in paraxis, psen <dig> and occasionally in uncx <dig>  deficient mice. our analysis of the tgieg mice clearly shows that these phenotypes can occur in mice with apparently normal r/c polarity of somites. the fact that rostral and caudal sclerotome derived structures were not missing in the tgieg mice additionally supports the hypothesis that r/c somite polarity is not affected and suggests an alternative origin of the axial dysmorphologies. a potential reason for the finding that transgenic dll <dig> over-expression does not affect the polarity of somites maybe that the endogenous expression of dll <dig> inhibts the ectopic activation of notch signalling in anterior somite compartments  <cit> .

dll <dig> over-expression might affect arthrotome cell differentiation
in addition to midline defects, we observe the loss or reduction of ivds, articular  joints and proximal ribs in the axial skeletons of tgieg animals. these phenotypic characteristics are present despite normal epithelialisation and r/c polarity in transgenic mice. one possible explanation for the transgenic phenotype affecting the intervertebral joints may be that the loss of restricted dll <dig> expression results in a late defect in resegmentation of sclerotomal compartments. alternatively, we noted that all the vertebral structures  that are affected in dll <dig> over-expressing mice are located in a central position of the vertebral motion segment. injection of single somite cells with fluorescent dye  <cit>  and homotopical grafting experiments of quail and chicken somitocoele cells  <cit>  had previously suggested that somitocoele cells form a distinct somitic compartment, the arthrotome. during later development these cells are located at a central position of the vertebral motion segment forming vertebral joints, ivds and the proximal ribs  <cit> . accordingly, the microsurgical removal of somitocoele cells from chick epithelial somites and preventing the epithelial cells from contributing to the somitocoele cell population, resulted in the loss of ivds, fusion of vertebral bodies and the absence of intervertebral joints  <cit> . these analyses on the immediate fate of somitocoele cells have consistently been performed in the avian system  <cit> . a related study in mice showed pax <dig> expression in somitocoele cells and the ventromedial sclerotome. mice deficient for the pax <dig> gene lack derivatives of the ventromedial sclerotome or have reduced ivds, proximal ribs and articular processes  <cit> . considering the experimental evidence on the fate of somitocoele cells in the avian embryo and of pax <dig> expressing cells in mice, we propose the hypothesis that the observed reduction or loss of central structures of the vertebral motion segment may be due to a failure in the development or specification of the arthrotome in tgieg transgenic embryos. however, we did not observe any changes in the expression of pax <dig> in transgenic embryos. this observation together with the normal histological appearance of somites suggests that the dll <dig> over-expression throughout somites and the psm does not affect the initial formation of somitocoele cells. instead we consider the possibility that the over-expression of dll <dig> in epithelia of somites might affect the contribution of epithelial cells to the somitocoele  <cit> .

dll <dig> over-expression negatively regulates chondrocyte differentiation
tgieg animals exhibited a delay in chondrocyte hypertrophy and endochondral bone formation in presumptive vertebral bodies. mid-sagittal as well as lateral-sagittal sections through the vertebral column of transgenic embryos at e <dig>  and e <dig>  displayed less hypertophic chondrocytes that undergo endochondral ossification than in wild-type embryos . previous lacz reporter gene analyses in dll1+/tm1gos animals  <cit>  revealed no dll <dig> expression in presumptive vertebral bodies, ivds or the notochord  <cit> . we therefore assume that chondrocyte maturation was inhibited in transgenic embryos due to the earlier sclerotomal over-expression of dll <dig>  these observations essentially confirm previous studies that have revealed that delta/notch signalling acts as a negative regulator for the transition from pre-hypertrophic to hypertrophic chondrocytes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the over-expression of the dll <dig> gene in rostral epithelial somites was not sufficient to confer caudal somite identity to rostral compartments in transgenic embryos. it had been suggested previously that the compartmentalised expression of dll <dig> later in epithelial somites might be necessary for the maintenance of segment boundaries. however, it has been unclear so far, through which biological process dll <dig> could function to maintain segment boundaries. our data from transgenic mice over-expressing dll <dig> suggest that the restricted dll <dig> expression in caudal epithelial somites may be required for the proper development of the arthrotome compartment. the failure of arthrotome development in tgieg mice leads to distinct dysmorphologies of the central region of the vertebral motion segment. the mechanism through which dll <dig> acts to specify cells of the arthrotome still needs to be elucidated.
