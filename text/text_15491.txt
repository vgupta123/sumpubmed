BACKGROUND
next-generation dna sequencing  typically requires nanogram to microgram levels of dna. many specimens of interest have insufficient amounts of nucleic acids for direct sequencing. to sequence these samples one must amplify the dna without altering the representation of the original dna sample. a widely used method for whole genome amplification is multiple displacement amplification ; mda relies on priming of target dna with random primers and the use of the strand-displacing φ <dig> polymerase to amplify all of the dna in a given sample 
. φ <dig> dna polymerase is a highly processive, strand-displacing polymerase with a very low error rate of  <dig> in 106- <dig> nucleotides 
 <cit> ; the error rates of taq polymerase and pfu polymerase, both commonly used in pcr are  <dig> in  <dig> and  <dig> in  <dig>  respectively 
 <cit> . recently a method for the whole genome amplification of dna from single cells called malbac was reported to perform better than mda 
 <cit> . this method employs several rounds of multiple primer annealing extension cycles with a strand-displacing polymerase followed by pcr. another report describes the use of mda in nanoliter-scale polydimethylsiloxane microwells produced in a microfabrication facility 
 <cit> . despite total reaction volumes of 12 nl, the segregation of intact bacterial cells does not result in total fluidic isolation, requires nanoliter liquid handling capabilities and loading cells at a density that results in 90% empty wells. in this study, we report improvements to typical φ29-based mda protocols through the addition of a second strand-displacing dna polymerase, improved reaction formulation and conditions. previous studies have shown that φ29-based amplification in the presence of a second strand-displacing dna polymerase improves dna microarray sensitivity relative to multiplex pcr amplification or amplification with φ <dig> dna polymerase alone 
 <cit> . our imda protocol does not require the use of facs, specialized microfabrication or operating with nanoliter volumes yet provides an ultraclean dna amplification reaction.

a number of mda kits are commercially available; however, these kits generally recommend 10 ng of template dna. this requirement stems from the fact that reagents included with the kits contain contaminating dna that compete with the amplification of template of interest 
 <cit> . sensitivity of mda can be significantly improved by employing reagents that are free of contaminating dna. in addition, laboratory consumables can also be a source of contaminating dna that can confound genetic analyses. between  <dig> and  <dig> the "phantom of heilbronn" was one of germany's most wanted criminals; this female dna profile was found in samples collected at over  <dig> crime scenes 
 <cit> . after inconsistent results led to a more thorough investigation, the dna profile was found to belong to a woman working in the factory that made swabs used to collect dna evidence 
 <cit> . there have also been reports of dna contamination in nucleic acid extraction columns with both mouse-specific nucleic acids and xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus  were detected in the eluants from new naïve columns 
 <cit> . these reports could be dismissed as isolated incidents except that upon screening of public, non-primate nucleic acid sequence databases such as ncbi, ensembl, jgi, and ucsc, contamination with the primate-specific element aluy was found in  <dig> of  <dig> database entries, suggesting widespread human dna contamination in studies employing dna sequencing 
 <cit> .

in previous work by others, enzyme production methods have been modified to reduce contaminating dna 
 <cit> . in addition, pcr amplification buffers and enzymes have been decontaminated by treatment with heat-sensitive dna nucleases 
 <cit> . uv irradiation has also been used to decontaminate reagents and laboratory disposables used in mda 
 <cit>  but is of limited value as the extent of the dna degradation by the uv light decreases with the square of the distance from the uv light source and can have a negative effect on the properties of the reagents and materials treated. laboratory disposables have also been decontaminated with ethylene oxide  
 <cit> . the effectiveness of both uv or ethylene oxide treatment has been limited for nucleic acid decontamination as the cell walls and membranes of an organism can serve to protect the cellular dna 
 <cit> .

in this study we report the development and performance of methods for producing ultraclean imda reactions that are especially well suited for whole genome analyses by ngs. as part of these studies we developed an ethylene oxide protocol for the decontamination of laboratory consumables that inactivates free dna as well as dried cellular dna. the ultraclean reagents and consumables enabled the amplification of trace levels of target dna while maintaining both genomic representation and balance of the starting dna sample.

RESULTS
decontamination of laboratory consumables with eto
to determine the effectiveness of the eto treatment, laboratory consumables were contaminated with bacterial dna, whole bacterial cells, or human dna. k. pneumoniae dna was dried onto pipette tips prior to the eto treatment protocol. four identical sets of ten contaminated pipette tips were packaged into individual test boxes. three of these test boxes were subject to the eto protocol. the contaminating dna was recovered by rinsing the pipette tips repeatedly with warm tris-edta buffer. the quantity of the dna recovered from the pipette tips was determined with a k. pneumonia-specific qpcr assay. from the tips not treated with eto, the average amount of dna recovered was 21 ng per tip. of the fifteen tips treated with eto, all had k. pneumonia dna below the limit of detection of the qpcr assay  representing a greater than 6x <dig> fold reduction in the level of detectable dna .table  <dig>

to determine the effectiveness of the eto treatment protocol for the elimination of cellular dna, b. cereus overnight cultures in rich media  were dried in micro-centrifuge tubes and subject to eto treatment in differing locations in the treatment chamber. the nucleic acids were recovered from the tubes, and the level of b. cereus dna was determined using a bacillus-specific qpcr assay. between 79 ng and 101 ng of bacillus dna was recovered from non-eto-treated tubes contaminated with the 20-μl samples and between 290 ng and 514 ng was recovered from tubes contaminated the 100-μl aliquots . all eto-treated tubes that had been contaminated with bacillus cells had dna below the limits of detection of the qpcr assay  representing a > <dig> fold reduction in the amount of detectable dna following eto treatment. based upon the performance of the exogenous qpcr internal positive control there was no indication of qpcr inhibition.

macherey-nagel nucleic acid extraction columns were contaminated with 20 ng of human genomic dna and treated with the eto protocol. dna was recovered from the columns, and the level of human dna was determined with human alu-specific qpcr. there was a > <dig>  fold reduction in the dna recovered from the eto-treated vs. untreated contaminated columns . the eto-treated columns were also tested to assure that the eto treatment did not affect performance. three treated and three untreated columns were used to extract 100 ng of k. pneumoniae dna with no significant difference in performance .

comparison of sensitivities of imda and commercial mda kits
the sensitivity and specificity of the imda protocol was compared to sensitivity and specificity of two different commercial mda kits: qiagen repli-g® ultrafast mini kit and genomiphi v <dig> dna amplification kit. for these tests, a very low level of b. cereus bacterial genomic dna  was used as a template in the amplification reactions. the resulting amplified dna was sequenced on an ion torrent semiconductor sequencing system. the dna sequences from each reaction were subject to analysis with the ibis galaxy analysis software to determine their meta-genomic species composition; the identified species in each sample were used to construct the pie-charts shown in figure 
 <dig>  the imda sequencing reactions produced  <dig>  ×  <dig> reads  with > <dig>  ×  <dig> of the reads specifically identified by the ibis galaxy analysis. the imda template genome, b. cereus was identified as the source of > <dig> %  of the mapped reads with  <dig> % of the reads mapping to other bacillus clade species.figure  <dig>

genomic dna amplified by  the ibis ultraclean imda protocol or with commercial wga kits  genomiphi v <dig> wga or  qiagen repli-g wga. all amplified reactions were sequenced by ion semiconductor sequencing  followed by metagenomic analysis. *all reads that mapped to the b. cereus clade  are reported as b. cereus. **all reads that mapped to escherichia or shigella are reported as e. coli.



sequencing of the qiagen repli-g mda amplified dna produced  <dig>  x  <dig> total reads  with  <dig> % of the reads being mapped by the ibis galaxy analysis. the vast majority  of the reads mapped to ralstonia pickettii, 3% mapped to e. coli or shigella, and only  <dig> % mapped to the template genome, b. cereus. due to the close genetic similarity of e. coli and shigella species, these reads were combined in figure 
 <dig>  sequencing of the genomiphi v <dig> mda amplified dna generated  <dig>  x  <dig> total reads  with  <dig>  x  <dig> reads being mapped by the ibis galaxy analysis. the majority of the reads mapped to e. coli  with an additional  <dig> % mapping to shigella species. again, because of the close genetic similarity of e. coli and shigella species, these reads were combined in figure 
 <dig>  only  <dig> % mapped to the actual template, b. cereus. the identification of o. cuniculus in the genomiphi v <dig> reactions was confirmed by collecting those specific reads  and using a separate metagenomic blast analysis. further analysis showed that of the reads matching o. cuniculus, 80% mapped to the alpha-globin gene.

the level of relative sensitivity of the imda reaction was compared to the repli-g wga and genomiphi v <dig> wga by dividing the percentage of reads mapped to b. cereus in imda  by the percentage of reads mapped to b. cereus in the commercial wga reactions . from this analysis, the imda reaction was nearly  <dig> fold more sensitive than the repli-g wga and the genomiphi v <dig> wga when there was a low level of input template.

genomic representation analysis of imda dna by ngs
to assess whether the imda method achieves relatively complete coverage of the input genome, a non-stochastic amount of b. cereus template dna  was amplified  in a 2-h imda reaction. an aliquot of the imda reaction and two independent non-amplified b. cereus genomic dna  samples were used to produce sequencing libraries. the sequencing reactions were mapped to the b. cereus atcc  <dig>  published sequence with nextgene software from softgenetics. the results are summarized in table 
 <dig>  sequence data obtained from the imda template and from both of the genomic templates covered more than  <dig> % of the reference genome at least 1x coverage) and greater than  <dig> % of the genome with at least 5x coverage. the average read lengths were comparable  as were the total number of bases read . the average coverage of the imda template was  <dig> fold, whereas that of the purified genome was  <dig> fold. figure 
 <dig> depicts the coverage vs. position for the imda data at various degrees of resolution; these data demonstrate the uniformity of the genomic coverage indicating that the imda protocol did not introduce bias. the depth of coverage between imda and genomic dna samples were compared in 500-bp bins across the genome . the average variation between the two samples of genomic dna was  <dig>  fold . the average variation between imda and the genomic dna was  <dig>  fold ; for  <dig> % of the sequence bins the variation was within  <dig> fold and for  <dig> % of the bins variation was within  <dig> fold. this is especially notable as the imda sample was amplified more than  <dig> x <dig> fold. we were not able to make a comparable comparison for representation and coverage using commercial mda kits. for example mda utilizing the illustra genomiphi v <dig> kit with 1 pg of b cereus template dna yielded only 37 ng of b. cereus dna, as determined by qpcr. the total dna yield of  <dig>  μg of dna indicated only  <dig> x <dig> fold amplification of the b. cereus dna and less than 1% of the total amplified dna was derived from the template dna.table  <dig>

coverage uniformity across the genome
in order to assess coverage uniformity and relative bias generated by the imda process we generated lorenz curves from sequence derived from 1 pg of b.cereus genomic template amplified by imda and unamplified template. the results are shown in figure 
 <dig> in which we compare the lorenz curves from both samples at an average coverage depth of 73x. the diagonal line indicates perfect uniformity of coverage and deviation indicates an uneven distribution of reads. it is evident that the imda provides a very high uniformity of genomic coverage and this is in good agreement with the  <dig> % coverage value calculated in table 
 <dig> figure  <dig>

. lorentz curves depict the relative bias in average read coverage across the b. cereus genome. each curve was calculated by dividing the genome into 500 bp bins, counting the average read depth across each bin, and using the resultant cumulative distribution function for read depth to determine the cumulative proportion of total genome coverage  accounted for by the cumulative proportion of bins . the ideal lorentz curve  for a distribution in which all of the bins have the same coverage is plotted for comparison.



discussion
advancements in ngs technologies are revolutionizing biology. the ability to generate very deep sequence analysis of a dna sample in a very short time allows the investigation of many complex samples with meta-genomic analysis. however, any contaminants contained in the sample buffers, enzymes, or laboratory consumables will confound the analysis. there are many potential sources of contamination including pipette tips, tubes, extraction columns, and commercial enzymes and buffers. contamination in any of these may negate even the most stringent contamination controls. we demonstrate here the ability to completely remove detectable levels of contaminating dna on pipette tips, centrifuge tubes, and extraction columns with an optimized ethylene oxide treatment process. this process did not interfere with downstream applications.

despite improvements in ngs sensitivity, there is still the requirement for a significant amount of template dna; typically 100 ng to 5000 ng of input dna. many important specimens contain dna at levels far below this threshold. to address this problem, a number of methods have been developed to amplify dna for ngs. however, these technologies are limited by the level of contaminating dna in enzymes, buffers, and reagents used during the amplification and by their abilities to maintain representation of the starting sample. in some cases individual cells have been successfully isolated, amplified, and sequenced, but this typically required multiple rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting  
 <cit> , micromanipulation 
 <cit> , or micro-fluidics 
 <cit>  to separate the intact, individual cells. although these are powerful techniques, many samples of interest contain free dna and cannot be isolated in this manner. also, the amplification technology can introduce tremendous bias in the sequencing coverage 
 <cit> . most ngs technologies also employ a clonal amplification step, which can result in further bias. commercially available mda kits can be used to amplify dna for ngs but typically recommend >10 ng of initial template. even the recent single cell genomics studies start with ~5 pg, the genomic dna equivalent of a single eukaryotic cell 
 <cit> . this study compared the combination of ultraclean reagents and the imda protocol with two commercial mda kits. in this study we have developed methods for preparation of ultraclean reagents and have developed an improved multiple displacement amplification protocol that enables the successful amplification of 10 fg of dna template –  <dig> , <dig> fold less than required by commercial kits.

the imda protocol has several features that, in combination, improve its performance over a standard mda reaction. first the imda reaction employs φ <dig> dna polymerase and a second strand-displacing polymerase klenow exo-. though klenow exo- is not a proof reading polymerase it has an error rate that is comparable to taq 
 <cit> . the combined use of φ <dig> and klenow has been previously shown to improve amplification compared to amplification by φ <dig> alone with dna microarrays 
 <cit> . dna amplification by klenow exo- used in strand displacement amplification  is not limited to higher molecular weight templates like mda using φ <dig> dna polymerase 
 <cit> . we posit that the use of these two strand-displacing dna polymerases may complement each other to better amplify templates of varying lengths. the imda reaction buffer also contains high levels of the thermo-protectant trehalose, which enables the reaction to be performed at 37°c vs. 30°c. trehalose has also been previously shown to improve mda performance 
 <cit> . the imda reaction buffer also contains high levels of non-ionic detergent which improved the yields of the reactions 
 <cit> . lastly the imda protocol also employs, random septamers rather than hexamers to provide a correspondingly higher tm and longer primer length has been shown to reduce the km of klenow fragment potentially improving its performance in imda 
 <cit> . the imda protocol employs a very high fidelity proof reading dna polymers, φ <dig>  and a non-proof reading polymerase with an error comparable to taq dna polymerase use of dna amplified using the imda protocol in ngs reactions resulted in greater coverage across the genomic template than did commercially available mda kits and maintained representative balance especially when employing processes for removing background dna in the reagents. combined with ethylene oxide treatment protocol for the decontamination of the laboratory consumables, developed in this study, the sequencing coverage and sequencing accuracy from specimens with low levels of dna is greatly improved.

by employing this combination of strategies, the imda method outperforms published mda in the specific amplification of target template and uniformity of coverage indicating very little introduction of bias even with extreme amplification 
 <cit> . the imda protocol does not require extensive enzyme purification or microfabrication facilities and enables the use of standard reaction volumes. this combination of ultraclean consumables and reagents, along with improvements incorporated into imda provides the opportunity for specific detection and genomic sequence analysis from samples that were previous not possible due to template limitation.

CONCLUSIONS
the imda reaction developed in this study significantly outperformed commercial mda kits in the ability to amplify specimens with low levels of dna. and importantly the imda protocol maintains balance and representation. the imda protocol combined with ultra-clean reagents and consumables has broad utility for metagenomics, molecular diagnostics, ancient dna analysis, pre-implantation embryo screening, whole genome analysis of circulating tumor cells, and forensic applications for both human and microbial targets. use of this protocol will make in-depth genetic analysis of extremely low level dna templates, including those derived from single cells and viruses, possible.
