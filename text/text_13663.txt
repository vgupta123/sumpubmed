BACKGROUND
lichens are symbiogenetic organisms composed of fungi  and their photosynthetic partners . they are poikilohydrous, subject to repeated desiccation/rehydration cycles, and able to survive in extreme, frequently very dry environments, such as deserts or the arctic tundra. reactive oxygen species  are known to be a major cause of damage during desiccation, especially in photosynthetic organisms  <cit> . in some species, rehydration provokes an extracellular oxidative burst  and it has been shown that the status of the antioxidant glutathione  is correlated with the ability of lichens to tolerate desiccation  <cit> . furthermore, there is evidence of effective communication between mycobionts and photobionts, in which one partner up-regulates the antioxidant system of the other, endowing the symbiotic association with an important adaptive advantage and evolutionary success  <cit> . nonetheless, much remains to be learned about lichen metabolism of ros during dehydration/rehydration cycles, since it has been recently reported that classical antioxidant mechanisms play a limited role in the strategies that facilitate transition of photobionts to the desiccated state  <cit> .

reactive oxygen species are produced in the respiratory and photosynthetic electron chains of many organisms. in photosynthetic organisms, the production of ros is enhanced during desiccation and/or rehydration because carbon fixation is impaired, whereas chlorophyll electrons continue to be excited. ros result from the uncontrolled donation of electrons from electron transport chains in chloroplasts and mitochondria to molecular oxygen, initiating an indiscriminate chain reaction. if antioxidant defenses are overcome by ros production, the uncontrolled free radicals cause widespread cellular damage by provoking protein alterations, lipid peroxidation, and the formation of dna adducts  <cit> .

the bioactive gas nitric oxide  has multiple biological functions in a very broad range of organisms. these functions include signal transduction, cell death, transport, basic metabolism, ros production and degradation  <cit> , among others . it is well-known that no exerts both pro-oxidant and antioxidant effects, depending on the ambient redox status, the presence of other reactants, and the nature of the reaction . in plants, ros and reactive nitrogen species have been shown to be involved in the defensive response of plants to biotic or abiotic stresses such as pathogens  <cit> , drought  <cit> , and air pollutants or uv-b radiation  <cit> . in the latter study, the authors found support for the hypothesis that no reactive species, together with the glutathione system, play a key role in the coordination of gene expression during plant symbiosis. no has been postulated as one of the first antioxidant mechanisms to have evolved in aerobic cells  <cit> . this idea builds on the work of feelisch and martin  <cit> , who suggested a role for no in both the early evolution of aerobic cells and in symbiotic relationships involving no efficacy in neutralizing ros. in addition, no is involved in the abiotic stress response of green algae such as chlorella pyrenoidosa pringsheim, by reducing the damage produced by photo-oxidative stress  <cit> .

the first work that focused on no production in lichens was published in  <dig>  by weissman and co-workers  <cit> , who carried out a microscopy study of ramalina lacera  j.r. laundon. these authors described the occurrence of intracellular oxidative stress during rehydration together with the release of no by the mycobiont, but not by the photobiont. we have recently reported evidence that no is involved in oxidative stress in lichens exposed to the oxidative pollutant cumene hydroperoxide  <cit> . however, there have been no further studies on no function, or on the occurrence of no in other lichens.

real-time imaging of cellular function in vivo and of cell/tissue localization can be achieved with high sensitivity and specificity by using fluorescent probes together with fluorescence and confocal microscopy. for example, following entry of the probe dcfh2-da into the cell it is converted by intracellular esterases to dcfh <dig>  which upon oxidation by free radicals, mainly •oh, co3•-, no2•, and thyl radicals , yields the fluorescent product  .

nitrogen oxide is produced at low concentrations and has a short half-life, which makes it difficult to detect in vivo. interest in no, due to its ubiquity and physiological relevance, has therefore led to the generation of several techniques for measuring its production. for example, the rapid reaction of  <dig> -diaminonaphthalene  with no to form the fluorescent product 1--naphthotriazole  is the basis for a very sensitive analytical method to measure no production. dan does not react directly with no and therefore does not inhibit its actions. the high sensitivity of this technique allows its use in the quantification of no production in living cells  <cit> . however, perhaps the most commonly employed methods for the analysis of no in aqueous solutions is by measuring no2- using the griess reagent  <cit> . alternatively, inhibitors of no function can also be used to understand the physiological roles of this molecule. carboxy-ptio  is a water-soluble and stable free radical that reacts stoichiometrically with no. in vivo, c-ptio inhibits the physiological effects mediated by no, whereas in vitro it can be used to quantitate no levels by esr spectrometry  <cit> .

the lichen ramalina farinacea  ach. is a widespread species with large environmental tolerance. this green-greyish lichen is a fruticose, pendulous, epiphytic species that is very common in mediterranean sclerophyllous oak forests. it lives on a great variety of substrates and different habitats such as plant bark, decomposing wood and rocks  <cit> . in the iberian peninsula it occurs at all altitudes, more frequently in areas with regular fogs being absent in maritime habitats. it shows especial preference for places with a high atmospheric humidity. this lichen is the ramalina species with lower sensitivity to so <dig> and is considered as toxitolerant  <cit> .

the aim of this work is to investigate the release and role of no in the oxidative stress caused by rehydration in the lichen ramalina farinacea  ach. no and ros specific fluorescent probes will be used to morphologically localize these molecules in vivo with fluorescence and confocal microscopy. furthermore, ros kinetics and chlorophyll autofluorescence will be recorded during the first minutes after rehydration. lipid peroxidation and no-endproducts will be quantified at different time points. no especific inhibitor c-ptio will be used in order to elucidate no functions. likewise, no production and relation with photosynthesis will be studied in different models of isolated photobionts: ramalina farinacea  ach. isolated trebouxia sp. photobionts, and in asterochloris erici  skaloud et peksa, sag  <dig>  = utex  <dig> 

methods
chemicals
the chemicals  <dig> -di-tert-buthyl-4-methylphenol trichloroacetic acid , 2-thiobarbituric acid ,  <dig> , <dig> , tetraethoxypropane , cumene hydroperoxide 88% , and bisbenzimide h  were provided by sigma aldrich química s.a ;  <dig> -dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate , hydrochloric acid  and ethanol  were purchased from panreac química s.a.u ; 2-- <dig> , <dig> -tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide potassium salt  and  <dig> -diaminonaphthalene  were from invitrogen s.a ; and triton x- <dig> was from vwr prolabo .

lichen material
ramalina farinacea  ach. was collected in the air-dried state from quercus rotundifolia lam. at sierra de el toro . samples were maintained in a silica gel atmosphere during  <dig> h and frozen at -20°c until the experiment,  <dig> month after collection.

epifluorescence probes
 <dig> -dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate  was used as probe in the detection of ros . dcfh2-da is not appreciably oxidized to the fluorescent state without prior hydrolysis inside the cell.

 <dig> -diaminonaphthalene  reacts with the nitrosonium cation that forms spontaneously from no to yield the fluorescent product 1h-naphthotriazole which emits blue fluorescence . since the selectivity of dan for the nitrosonium cation is high, no can be detected without the inhibition of its function  <cit> .

fluorometric kinetics of free radical production and chlorophyll autofluorescence
dry fragments of lichen thalli were placed in black flat bottom  <dig> multiwell plates and kept at -20°c until use. one of the plates was rehydrated with deionised water  <dig> h before the experiment and kept at 17°c, par  <dig> μmol m- <dig> s- <dig>  <dig> h photoperiod.

both dry and hydrated lichens were submerged during  <dig> minutes in deionised water  <dig> μm dcfh2-da with or without c-ptio  <dig> μm. the excess of solution was eliminated and the kinetics of dcf and chlorophyll emitted fluorescence were simultaneously measured in a spectrafluor plus microplate reader . excitation of both substances was performed at λexc  <dig> nm, emission of dcf fluorescence was recorded at λem  <dig> nm and chlorophyll autofluorescence at λem  <dig> nm, during one hour. twelve replicates were analyzed by treatment and all values are referred to the weight of sample.

microscopy
fragments of lichen thalli were rehydrated for  <dig> min with either deionized water or  <dig> μm c-ptio, and the corresponding fluorescence probe . the samples were then placed in a freezing microtome  and cut in sections of  <dig> microns. the slices were washed with deionized water and mounted on slides prior to their observation by fluorescence microscopy  or confocal laser scanning microscopy  at the scsie .

isolated photobionts of ramalina farinacea
the photobiont r. farinacea  was isolated following the protocol described by gasulla et al.  <cit> . basically, it involves homogenization of lichen thalli , a one-step centrifugation through percoll , followed by washing with tween  <dig> and sonication. algae were grown in 3n bold's basal medium  containing  <dig> g casein and  <dig> g glucose per liter  <cit>  with a 16: <dig> h light:dark photoperiod and at a temperature of 15°c. the medium was changed every  <dig> weeks and the concentration of algae set at  <dig> cells/ml.

physiology of photosynthesis
an axenic strain of the lichen photobiont asterochloris erici  skaloud et peksa  was used for this study. algae were grown on cellulose-acetate discs on agar bbm3n containing  <dig> g casein and  <dig> g glucose per liter  <cit> . cultures were maintained at 20°c under a  <dig> h photoperiod with  <dig> μmol m-2s- <dig> white-light illumination.

after  <dig> days, the discs were removed from the culture medium and dried in a closed container with a saturated solution of ammonium nitrate , and maintained under culturing conditions. the samples remained in the dried state for  <dig> h, were then rehydrated with distilled water or  <dig> μm c-ptio and returned to culture conditions for  <dig> h.

in vivo chlorophyll a fluorescence was measured with a modulated light fluorometer . the samples were kept in the dark for  <dig> min and the minimum  fluorescence yield  measured after excitation of the algae with a weak measuring beam from a light-emitting diode. the maximum fluorescence yield  was determined with an  <dig> ms saturating pulse of white light . variable fluorescence  was calculated as fm-fo, and the maximum quantum yield of photosystem ii  as fv/fm. the samples were allowed to re-adapt in the dark for  <dig> min, after which actinic light  was switched on, and sps were applied at  <dig> min intervals to determine:  the maximum fluorescence yield during actinic illumination ,  the level of modulated fluorescence during a brief  interruption of actinic illumination in the presence of  <dig> μmol m- <dig> s- <dig> far red  light , and  steady-state chlorophyll a fluorescence yield after  <dig> pulses . photochemical quenching , and the quantum efficiency of psii photochemistry  were estimated following the methods of genty et al.  <cit>  and kramer et al.  <cit> .

measurement of malondialdehyde
lipid peroxidation was evaluated as malondialdehyde  by the method of reilly and aust  <cit> , modified as described below  <cit> . working standards were made by diluting a  <dig> mm stock solution of the malondialdehyde precursor tep with 80% ethanol supplemented with 2% of the antioxidant bht to suppress the decomposition of lipid peroxides during the assay. working concentrations of 0- <dig> μm were prepared for the lichens and 0- <dig> μm for the algae.

lichen thalli were homogenized on ice with  <dig> ml of deionized water and centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min. supernatants were frozen at -20°c for nox analysis, and the pellets resuspended in  <dig> μl ethanol-bht. algae were homogenized directly in  <dig> μl of ethanol-bht with glass fragments  and strong vortexing for  <dig> min. subsequently,  <dig> μm of tba , tca , and hcl  working solution was added to each sample and to the standards. the samples and standards were vortexed in a vortex labnet × <dig> for  <dig> min at  <dig>  rpm and then placed in a 70°c water bath for  <dig> min. afterwards, the samples and standards were vortexed again, cooled on ice, and centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min.

the absorbance of supernatants was measured at  <dig> nm  in a spectronic genesys <dig> spectrophotometer. the absorbance at  <dig> nm  was then measured and this value was subtracted from the a <dig> to eliminate the interferences of soluble sugars in the samples  <cit> .

no end-products determination
to estimate no generation, no oxidation end-products  were measured in the soluble fraction of the samples using a skalar autoanalyzer, model san++. the automated determination of nitrate and nitrite is based on the cadmium reduction method: the sample is passed through a column containing granulated copper-cadmium to reduce nitrate to nitrite. the nitrite  concentration is determined by its diazotization with sulfanilamide followed by coupling with n-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride to form a highly colored azo dye, the absorbance of which is measured at  <dig> nm. this is the most commonly used method to analyze no production and is known as the griess reaction  <cit> .

statistics
at least three samples for each treatment and each incubation time were prepared. four assays were carried out on four different days for the lichens and on three different days for the algae. data were analyzed for significance with student's t-test or by anova.

RESULTS
bright-field micrographs showing the general anatomy of ramalina farinacea are presented in figure  <dig>  the photobiont layer is located in the medulla and is surrounded by dispersed fungal hyphae, which become densely packed in the cortex of the lichen.

ros generation, chlorophyll autofluorescence and lipid peroxidation during lichen rehydration
although several works have described an extracellular oxidative burst during rehydration in some lichen species, virtually nothing is known about intracellular ros production and its relationship to abiotic stress. in order to determine whether intracellular ros release follows the rehydration of r. farinacea thalli,  <dig> μm of the fluorescent probe dfch2-da was added to the deionized water used for rehydration. the samples were observed by fluorescence and confocal microscopy 3- <dig> h after rehydration.

the presence of 2',7'- dichlorofluorescin , the fluorescent oxidation product of dcfh <dig>  indicated the intracellular production of free radicals during lichen rehydration . dcf was especially concentrated in the lichen cortex. no significant green autofluorescence was detected in the absence of the probe . confocal microscopy showed discrete points of green fluorescence around several large photobionts , probably due to mycobiont hyphae tips.

a fluorometric kinetics of intracellular free radical production in ramalina farinacea thalli was performed in order to confirm microscopical data. figure 3a demonstrates that the rate of intracellular free radical production in recently rehydrated thalli was much higher than the rate of intracellular free radical production in thalli kept in the hydrated state during the previous  <dig> h. furthermore, intracellular release of free radicals during rehydration under physiological conditions was biphasic with an initial exponential phase of  <dig> min followed by a linear phase . chlorophyll autofluorescence was simultaneously recorded since this parameter is a surrogate of the levels and integrity of this molecule and therefore of the photosynthetic status of the cell. a slight increase in chlorophyll autofluorescence both in thalli hydrated for  <dig> h  and in thalli recently rehydrated  could be measured.

to determine whether the observed increase of ros caused oxidative stress during rehydration, lipid peroxidation in r. farinacea was quantified in the first  <dig> h of rehydration under physiological conditions. after  <dig> h of rehydration, mda levels dropped significantly to a minimum . after  <dig> h, the levels began to increase such that they were slightly elevated at  <dig> h, at which time the maximum value was reached. this latter amount was unchanged at  <dig> h post-rehydration.

no release during lichen rehydration
the release of no in a lichen species was recently demonstrated for the first time. in order to confirm these results in another lichen species, r. farinacea, two approaches were used: fluorescence visualization of the released no and quantification of the no end-products. accordingly, thalli were rehydrated in deionized water containing  <dig> μm dan for the visualization of no release and in deionized water alone for the quantification of no end-products.

microscopic analysis of blue fluorescence evidenced the production of no, which was intimately associated with the fungal hyphae. staining was especially intense in the medulla .

air oxidation of no in an aqueous environment results in the near exclusive generation of no2-, which is further oxidized to no <dig> =  <cit> . no end-products  were quantified by the classical method of griess. nox levels increased over  <dig> h to reach a maximum . by  <dig> h, nox levels had decreased to slightly below the initial levels, reaching a minimum, after which the levels remained constant for up to  <dig> h.

effect of no scavenging during lichen rehydration on ros production, chlorophyll autofluorescence and lipid peroxidation
to study the role of no during rehydration, r. farinacea thalli were rehydrated with  <dig> μm of the membrane-permeable compound c-ptio, which specifically reacts with no to inhibit its biological actions.

no scavenging with c-ptio completely suppressed dan fluorescence emission . it also produced a remarkable increase in ros production in both the cortex and the medulla . the confocal laser beam produced an oxidative burst in the photobionts, leading to chlorophyll photo-oxidation and dcf fluorescence onset within seconds .

the kinetics study  confirmed that no inhibition during rehydration multiplies the levels of intracellular free radicals at  <dig> min . moreover, inhibition of no eliminates the initial exponential phase of free radical production seen during physiological rehydration of thalli . chlorophyll autofluorescence was simultaneously measured and no evident differences between physiological and no-inhibited rehydration could be observed . however, no inhibition in 24h-hydrated thalli resulted in an important decrease in chlorophyll autofluorescence that tends to recover normal values after  <dig> h .

lipid peroxidation during no-specific inhibition with c-ptio was measured quantitatively; the results are presented in figure 4b. mda levels reach a maximum at  <dig> h and a minimum at  <dig> h. the mda levels measured following rehydration with cptio were the opposite of those obtained under physiological conditions. figure 4d shows that, overall, no end-products decreased in amount when c-ptio was used.

microscopy studies of isolated algae
confocal studies clearly showed that no deprivation caused photo-oxidative damage in the photobiont . no is known to reduce photo-oxidative stress in some species of green algae. a specific role for no in the prevention of photo-oxidation in trebouxia algae was confirmed in the following studies.

a suspension of axenically cultured trebouxia sp., the photobiont isolated from r. farinacea, was treated with  <dig> μm c-ptio in the presence of both dcfh2-da and dan. the images of control cells are presented in figure 6a. no inhibition by c-ptio resulted in chlorophyll bleaching in some algae . dan fluorescence could not be detected by this method but the oxidative burst caused by c-ptio provided indirect evidence of endogenous no production in the algae. direct measurements of no end-products in the supernatant of photobiont suspensions at different time periods of culture  showed that these algae were able to produce no in the low-nanogram range. no levels reached a peak of  <dig> ng per million cells  <dig> h after preparation of the suspension .

photosynthetic studies on isolated algae
to confirm that the visualized alterations in chlorophyll fluorescence were linked to alterations in the photosynthetic activity of the algae during no deprivation, axenic cultures of asterochloris erici, a well-characterized photobiont, were studied. the cells were cultured on cellulose-acetate discs, desiccated for  <dig> h, and rehydrated with  <dig> μm c-ptio. measurements were made in cells that had been maintained in culture conditions for  <dig> h. the significant decrease of fv/fm and Фpsii indicated that no scavenging induces photo-inhibition of psii . the degree of quinone a  oxidation was determined as qp, which depends on the activation state of photosystem i  and the calvin cycle  <cit> . after the dehydration/rehydration cycle, no differences were observed in qp, indicating that photoinhibition was produced before qa.

the same treatments and measurements were carried out in whole thalli of r. farinacea but no alterations in photosynthesis at  <dig> h were observed .

discussion
this study investigated the role of no during rehydration in ramalina farinacea. the results showed that lichen no plays an important role in the regulation of lipid peroxidation and photobiont photo-oxidative stress during rehydration.

no is a well-studied critical signaling molecule involved in abiotic stress responses  <cit>  and plant defence  <cit> . our results demonstrated that, in addition to its utility for quantification methods, dan is an excellent fluorescence microscopy probe for the histophysiological characterization of no production in lichen.

the ability of ros production to induce oxidative stress depends on the balance between cellular pro-oxidants and antioxidants, with an imbalance between the two resulting in oxidative damage. thus, studies of ros release using probes such as dcfh <dig> only determine the levels of pro-oxidant species but do not indicate the degree of oxidative stress. instead, lipid peroxidation, measured as mda, has long been used to characterize oxidative damage in cells and was the approach used in this study.

our data showed that rehydration is accompanied by ros and no generation and thus confirmed the results of weissman et al.  <cit> . the kinetics of ros release is biphasic with an initial exponential phase  followed by a linear phase up to  <dig> h. the quantification of no end-products showed that released no reaches a maximum 1- <dig> h post-rehydration. despite the presence of ros, lipid peroxidation significantly decreased during the first hours following rehydration, reaching a minimum after  <dig> h, which coincided with the maximum levels of no end-products.

our microscopy studies revealed that the production of ros and no is closely related to lichen morphology: ros was mainly associated with the hyphae of the cortex whereas no was clearly localized to the medullar hyphae of the mycobiont. confocal microscopy confirmed that the medulla is free of intracellular ros, which were seen only in a few punctate zones around several large photobionts . since ros are now recognized as key signaling molecules in yeast and in plants  <cit> , these areas could constitute points of communication between the fungus and algae and are perhaps related to the mutual up-regulation of protective systems, as suggested by kranner et al.  <cit> . further investigations are needed to clarify this point.

no scavenging during lichen rehydration resulted in increased ros production and lipid peroxidation. moreover, the initial exponential phase of free radical production is eliminated. this finding demonstrates that no is involved in antioxidant defense and the regulation of lipid peroxidation especially during the first minutes after rehydration. in plants and in animals, no is known to modulate the toxic potential of ros and to limit lipid peroxidation, acting as a chain-breaking antioxidant to scavenge peroxyl radicals  <cit> .

the incidence of the confocal laser on the algae of no-deprived rehydrating thalli caused a rapid photo-oxidative burst and isolated photobionts showed evidence of oxidative destruction of chlorophyll even in the absence of the photo-stress caused by a confocal laser. furthermore, no-endproducts quantification supports the ability of trebouxia photobionts to produce no, eventually in important amounts . chlorophyll autofluorescence informs about the levels and integrity of this molecule. no appreciable changes in chlorophyll autofluorescence were seen during rehydration but the inhibition of no in thalli hydrated for  <dig> h induced a reversible decrease in this parameter during  <dig> h. no has been shown to ameliorate ros toxicity in the chlorophycean alga scenedesmus obliquus, probably by preventing the photo-inhibition that leads to photo-oxidation and pigment bleaching  <cit> . our studies on the physiology of photosynthesis show that the inhibition of no action altered the photosynthetic activity of the photobionts. these results suggest that no is involved in psii stabilization and could be related with the limited role of classical antioxidant systems during desiccation-rehydration cycles in asterochloris  photobionts recently reported  <cit> . several authors have demonstrated that, in higher plants, no reversibly binds to psii  <cit>  and modulates electron transfer and quenching processes  <cit> . the fact that the same dose of c-ptio than that used for photobionts did not alter photosynthetic activity in the photobionts of intact lichens suggests that the mycobiont is involved in stabilizing the photobiont's chlorophyll. assays with higher doses of c-ptio and specific inhibitors of fungal no synthases are needed to confirm this possibility.

CONCLUSIONS
these data provide the first evidence of an important role for no in oxidative stress regulation during the early stages of rehydration in the lichen ramalina farinacea, including chlorophyll photostability of the trebouxioid photobionts . our results also raise important questions about the evolutionary role of no in the establishment of lichen symbiosis, due to its dual role as antioxidant and mediator in cell communication.

future research should be directed at functional , ultrastructural , and cell communication  studies of no, with the aim of clarifying the role of this multifaceted molecule.
