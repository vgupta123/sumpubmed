BACKGROUND
pearl millet   is the sixth most important global cereal crop  grown as a rainfed grain and fodder crop in the hottest, driest regions of sub-saharan africa and the indian subcontinent. it produces nutritious grain and is a major human food for people living in the semi-arid, low input, dryland agriculture regions of africa and south asia.

molecular markers-based genetic maps are necessary for applied genetics and breeding programmes of pearl millet. compared to other cereals such as rice, sorghum, maize, wheat, and barley, there has been relatively little research on the development and application of molecular-markers based genetic maps in pearl millet. hitherto, genetic maps in pearl millet have been based on markers such as restriction fragment length polymorphism  and amplified fragment length polymorphism   <cit>  with the simple sequence repeat  and diversity array technolgy -based maps  <cit>  now being in ascendancy. these maps have proven useful not only in the identification of qtls and breeding for drought tolerance  <cit> , disease resistance  <cit>  and stover quality  <cit>  but have also improved our understanding of complex relationships between the pearl millet genome and those of other graminaceous species  <cit> . despite the availability of a few moderate-density genetic maps and a bacterial artificial chromosome library  <cit> , progress towards identification of genes underlying traits of interest in pearl millet has been hampered by the laborious nature of map-based cloning. to link important agronomical and physiological traits to functional sequence variations and to find candidate genes underlying traits of agricultural interest, there is a need of developing and mapping gene-based markers which currently are in paucity in pearl millet. pearl millet would benefit greatly from a systematic effort to map functionally important genes to facilitate search for associations between candidate genes and qtls underlying agriculturally important traits. molecular variation based on functionally defined genes underlying specific biochemical or physiological functions will provide the next generation of molecular markers for pearl millet. the advantage of such markers, often described as 'candidate gene-based', is their close association with loci controlling variation for the trait in question, allowing the development of 'perfect markers'  <cit>  that can be used for linkage disequilibrium  based mapping studies  <cit>  and the direct selection of genotypes with superior allele content  <cit> .

est resources have proven to be excellent resources for gene discovery, molecular marker development, analysis of gene expression, and identification of candidate genes for phenotypes of interest in a number of species  <cit> . the est approach is particularly useful for taxa whose genome sequence is presently unavailable or otherwise have limited sequence information. recently, ests have been used for identifying snps in many plant species such as rice, maize, barley, soybean, sugarcane, sugar beet and melon  <cit> . the abundance, ubiquity and interspersed nature of snps together with the potential of automatic high-throughput analysis make them ideal candidates as molecular markers for construction of high density genetic maps  <cit> , association analysis of candidate genes with important agronomic traits  <cit> , fine mapping of qtls  <cit> , genetic diversity assessment  <cit>  and marker-assisted plant breeding  <cit> . in addition, snps located in known genes provide a fast alternative to analyse the fate of agronomically important alleles in breeding populations, thus providing functional markers.

in the present study, we have exploited available pearl millet est sequences to generate a mapped resource of  <dig> new gene-based markers for pearl millet. both positional and candidate gene approaches were combined to generate the present gene-based map. the resulting map was used as a template to overlay a major validated dt-qtl  <cit>  to identify the underlying candidate genes. the presented approach demonstrates how integration of different genomic resources, such as ests/genes with traditional genetic and phenotypic data can improve our understanding of complex traits and gene function. such a molecular map, based on genes with assigned functional roles in plant adaptation to drought and other abiotic stresses, may also be useful for comparing the structure and function of distantly related plant genomes such as other poaceae members.

RESULTS
length and single nucleotide polymorphism in mapping population parental pairs
a set of  <dig> gene-specific primers was used to amplify the dna of four pearl millet inbred lines, h 77/833- <dig>  prlt 2/89- <dig>  icmr  <dig> and icmr  <dig>  one-hundred and ninety  of these primer pairs showed strong single reproducible bands on 1% agarose gels. the products of these  <dig> primers were run on 6% polyacrylamide gel to screen for length polymorphisms. eighteen and ten primers were polymorphic between h 77/833- <dig> and prlt 2/89- <dig>  and between icmr  <dig> and icmr  <dig>  respectively. the remaining amplicons which did not detect any length polymorphism in parents but showed single monomorphic band on polyacrylamide gels were sequenced in the four parental genotypes for snp discovery.

in all, length and  sequence polymorphism was detected for  <dig> markers. the majority of successful assays  detected sequence polymorphisms, while only 16% exhibited length polymorphisms. in total,  <dig>  bp of non-redundant sequence data was scanned leading to identification of  <dig> snps with an overall frequency of one snp per  <dig> bp . the number of snps detected between prlt 2/89- <dig> and h 77/833- <dig>  was much higher than between parental pair icmr <dig> and icmr <dig>  with an snp frequency of 1/ <dig> and 1/ <dig> bp, respectively. in the total set of snps, transitions accounted for  <dig>  and transversions for  <dig> , respectively. of the  <dig> gene fragments in which snps were discovered,  <dig> had a single snp and multiple snp loci were detected in the remainder . the size of indels in cisp markers ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp .

linkage mapping
all the polymorphic markers identified in this study segregated in a co-dominant manner. a total of  <dig> markers  were assigned to seven linkage groups , designated as lg1-lg <dig> corresponding to the reference map. the gene-based snp and cisp markers were distributed on all seven linkage groups. the map of lg <dig>  the main target of this study, where a major dt-qtl of pearl millet resides, was saturated with  <dig> new gene-based markers of which  <dig> were snps and  <dig> were cisps. most importantly,  <dig> new gene-based markers were mapped within the support interval of the validated major dt-qtl region  on lg <dig> which originally had only five est-ssr markers loci mapping across this interval  <cit> . the least  number of genes were mapped on lg <dig>  individually, lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig> were mapped with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> new gene-based markers, respectively. the total map distance of the combined ssr, snp and cisp marker map was  <dig>  cm, with lengths of individual linkage groups ranging from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  .

allele frequencies in the h 77/833- <dig> × prlt 2/89- <dig> ril population
interestingly, distorted segregation ratios were evident on almost all linkage groups for both framework ssr loci as well as snp and cisp markers loci. within each segregation distortion region , distortion was unidirectional, favouring alleles exclusively from one parent. for instance, on lg <dig> there is a major region of segregation distortion between xibmsp <dig> and xipes <dig>  prlt 2/89- <dig> alleles are overrepresented in this distorted region as compared to region between xctm <dig> and xicmp <dig> where h 77/833- <dig> alleles are preferred. significant regions of distortions with preference for prlt 2/89- <dig> alleles were also noted on lg <dig> , lg <dig> , lg <dig>  and lg <dig> . on lg <dig>  a modest but consistent segregation distortion was observed between xipes <dig> and xpsmp <dig> and transmission frequency was again higher for alleles of male parent prlt 2/89- <dig>  on lg <dig>  on the other hand, the h 77/833- <dig> alleles were more prominent between xibmsp <dig> and xibmcp <dig> 

validation of gene-based markers with the major dt-qtl on lg  <dig> using fine mapping population
large number of markers  mapping to lg  <dig> showed significant association with yield and yield components, flowering time, delayed leaf senescence and leaf roll under drought stress in the fine mapping population. for illustrating that the markers developed in this study co-map with the dt phenotype, only grain yield, flowering time and leaf rolling data is presented . a detailed dissection of other yield and physiological parameters of the dt-qtl using these markers is currently underway and will be reported separately .

discussion
due to the multiplicity of genes and their partial effects on phenotypic variation, the candidate gene approach is suggested to be more suitable for qtl characterization than genome wide scanning or positional cloning  <cit> . molecular-linkage maps based on functional gene markers  are a prerequisite for a candidate-gene approach to identify genes responsible for quantitative traits at the molecular level. therefore, plant function maps have recently been generated in many species  <cit>  and candidate genes have been identified for various biotic stress resistance and abiotic stress tolerance qtls using this approach  <cit> . considering this, and the fact that hitherto little information on gene-based snps is available in pearl millet  <cit> , the present study was undertaken to develop a resource of mapped gene-based snps for pearl millet and to identify putative candidate genes underlying a major validated drought tolerance qtl.

we placed  <dig> gene-based snps and cisps onto existing ssr-based skeleton map of pearl millet based on the cross h 77/833- <dig> × prlt 2/89- <dig>  although the number of markers mapped earlier on this cross is relatively large, a high percentage of the markers are anonymous sequences and/or exhibit dominant patterns of inheritance  <cit> . recently, attempts have been made to enrich the existing pearl millet maps with co-dominant genomic and est-derived ssr markers  <cit> . the limitation of genomic ssrs is their low cross-species transferability due to either disappearance of the repeat region or degeneration of the primer binding sites. although cross-species pcr amplification of est-ssrs is more successful compared with genomic ssrs, their polymorphism rates are, however, very low. the snp markers, as developed in this study, provide many benefits over ssrs, including their abundance in the genome, frequent occurrence in coding regions of the genes, and their ease of analysis and unambiguous results across various platforms  <cit> . every snp in single copy dna is potentially a useful marker.

a total of  <dig> snps were obtained in  <dig>  kb sequenced region resulting in an snp frequency of one snp per  <dig> bp . in maize, an out-crossing species like pearl millet, snp frequency of one snp per  <dig> bp was observed with  <dig> gene fragments analysed in  <dig> inbred lines  <cit> . in another study on maize, snp frequency of  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp was observed with analysis of  <dig> unigenes in  <dig> inbred maize lines  <cit> . for out-breeding forage grass lolium perenne, a frequency of  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp was observed in the analysis of  <dig> candidate genes  <cit> . in rye and sugar beet, the estimated snp frequency was  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp  <cit>  and  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp  <cit> , respectively. thus, the polymorphism frequency determined for pearl millet is lower than those of other out-crossing species. selection of germplasm is one of the major factors that affect snp frequency. a contrasting variation in snp frequency was reported in two different sets of germplasm of maize having different number of accessions  <cit> . higher snp frequencies have generally been reported in studies involving a large number of diverse accessions  <cit> . compared to other studies, the number of genotypes used for snp discovery was very small in the present study. moreover, two  of the four pearl millet genotypes used in this study are qtl near-isogenic lines generated in the background of h 77/833- <dig>  the other important factor that affects snp frequency between different plant species is the differences in genomic region assayed e.g., coding regions, promoters, introns or untranslated regions   <cit> . the sequence set in the present study is not complete with respect to any of these categories; in general, this study targeted both exonic regions and 3' -utrs. considering this and the fact that the limited number of est sequences were analysed, the frequency estimates in this study might not reflect the exact picture for pearl millet.

the level of attrition from marker discovery to genetic map assignment in the present study was observed for only  <dig> snps . in lolium perenne, the same approach led to assignment of only 40% of the genes on the genetic map  <cit> . the addition of gene-based markers extended the genetic map of pearl millet by  <dig> cm; the total length of the combined ssr, snp and cisp marker-based map being  <dig>  cm. most importantly,  <dig> gene-based markers mapped to positions different to framework markers, thus enriching the map with new candidate gene loci . further, some of these candidate gene loci filled the large gaps present in some linkage groups of the framework map. for instance, the framework map had the largest  gap on lg <dig> between markers xpsmp <dig> and xipes <dig>  six gene-based markers  mapped between xpsmp <dig> and xipes <dig> on lg <dig> .

interestingly, the recombinant inbred line  mapping panel used in the present study revealed high rates of sdrs with both framework ssrs and gene-based snp and cisp markers. distortions toward either of the parental allele were observed. such segregation distortion due to an excess of one of the parental allele has also been reported in essentially all previous studies in pearl millet  <cit> . qi et al.  <cit> , for instance, observed sdrs due to an excess of one of the parental allele on lg  <dig> in the cross 81b × icmp  <dig>  on lg  <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig> in lgd 1-b- <dig> × icmp  <dig>  on lg <dig> and lg <dig> in pt 732b × p1449- <dig>  and on lg <dig> and lg <dig> in icmb  <dig> × 863b. however, segregation distortion in the rils used in the present study was significantly higher compared to all previous studies in pearl millet where f <dig> populations were used  <cit> . higher segregation distortions in rils compared to f <dig> or other early generations has been reported in other crops as well  <cit> . for example, in a comparative study carried out to explore segregation distortion of molecular markers in different mapping populations  in rice, consistently more segregation distortion was found in rils than in doubled-haploid, backcross, or f <dig> populations  <cit> . it has been suggested that more generations result in a stronger effect of selection and therefore segregation distortion accumulates with additional generations of meiosis  <cit> . preferential transmission of parental alleles could be caused by an allele-specific advantage in viability or fertility, and gene-based markers may represent or be linked to alleles selected during the six generations used for development of the rils.

the lg <dig>  the prime target of this study, was saturated with  <dig> new gene-based markers . of these,  <dig> were snps derived from genes coding for actin depolymerising factor, psi reaction centre subunit iii, phy c, actin, alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase, uridylate kinase, acyl coa oxidase, dipeptidyl peptidase iv, zn finger c × 8-c × 5-c × 3-h , serine/threonine protein kinase, a homolog of rice flowering time gene hd <dig>  mads-box, acetyl coa carboxylase, ubiquitin conjugated enzyme, photolyase, catalase, serine carboxypeptidase iii precursor and three hypothetical proteins. the four cisp markers on lg <dig> represented genes coding for a chlorophyll a/b binding protein, protein phosphatase  <dig> regulatory subunit sds <dig>  transmembrane amino acid transporter and a phosphoglycerate kinase. the pearl millet snp map for lg <dig> was generally consistent with chromosome-level pearl millet-rice synteny  previously determined with rflp markers  <cit> . for example, three genes retrieved from rice chromosome 2s  and three others from 6s  mapped on lg <dig> of pearl millet. in addition to lg <dig>  pearl millet-rice synteny observed in the present study was also consistent with previous study  <cit>  for other linkage groups. however, a few loci retrieved from rice mapped to nonsyntenic positions on pearl millet linkage groups. for example, uridylate kinase and acetyl coa carboxylase from rice chromosomes 1s and 5s, respectively, mapped on lg <dig> of pearl millet. similarly, vacuolar atpase subunit c from rice chromosome  <dig> l mapped on lg <dig> of pearl millet. such observations have been reported in other crops such as barley  <cit>  and sorghum  <cit>  and are not surprising given that the rice genome has undergone large segmental, as well as individual gene duplications, mostly after the divergence of rice and triticeae ancestors.

exploiting markers common between the present consensus map and other linkage maps of pearl millet, the position of major dt-qtls have been added to the present function map to identify potential candidate genes for drought tolerance . eighteen gene-based markers were localised in the support interval of major dt-qtl region on lg <dig> . of these, ten genes have been reported to play important roles in regulation , signal transduction , energy and carbon metabolism , purine and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis , and lipid biosynthesis  under drought and osmotic stresses  <cit> . the presence of transcription factors belonging to zn finger ccch type and mads-box gene families in support interval of major dt-qtl region is noteworthy. these transcription factors gene families have been reported to activate cascade of downstream genes that act together in enhancing tolerance to multiple stresses  <cit> . among the different types of zn finger families, role of c2h <dig> type zn finger gene families in drought stress tolerance has been functionally validated in rice and arabidopsis  <cit> . however, ccch types zn finger proteins are poorly characterized in plants under drought stress. the best characterized ccch-type zinc finger proteins in plants are osdos in rice  <cit> , atszf <dig> and atszf <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit>  and ghzfp <dig> in cotton  <cit>  under salt and fungal stresses. the ccch type zn finger in pearl millet shows significant homology with ring finger types osc3h <dig> and atc3h <dig> of rice  and arabidopsis , respectively, the members of which have been reported to be regulated by various biotic and abiotic stresses including water stress induced by mannitol  <cit> .

the mads-box family, identified initially as floral homeotic genes, is one of the most extensively studied transcription factor gene families in plants  <cit> . the most striking feature of the mads-box gene family is the diverse functions taken up by its members in different aspects of plant growth and development including flowering time control  <cit> . different members of mads family have been reported to be induced under drought stress in rice  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . the mads box gene in pearl millet shows significant homologies with mikc type mads-box genes of triticum aestivum , zea mays  and brachypodium . the homologue of mads <dig> in rice, osmads <dig>  has been reported to be up-regulated by more than two-fold in response to dehydration stress  <cit> . in pearl millet, polymorphism in the mads-box gene mads <dig> has been reported to be associated with flowering time variation  <cit> . studies have shown that a large number of genes involved in flower development are associated with abiotic stress responses  <cit> . the significant association of mads box gene with flowering time and grain yield qtls in pearl millet under drought stress  suggests this to be another strong candidate gene for dt-qtl in pearl millet.

similarly, the candidacy of serine/threonine protein kinase and acyl coa oxidase in the dt-qtl interval is supported by expression evidences of these genes in pearl millet  <cit> . a ~ <dig> fold increase in expression was obtained for both serine/threonine protein kinase and acyl coa oxidase in pearl millet seedlings subjected to drought stress  <cit> . another important gene mapped in the support interval of major dt-qtl was that coding for acetyl-coa carboxylase . in plants, acc isozymes provide malonyl coa pools used for de novo fatty acid synthesis in plastids and mitochondria, and for fatty acid elongation, flavonoid and stilbene biosynthesis in the cytosol  <cit> . acc reaction is the most important regulatory step, controlling metabolite flow in response to stress. from the water-deficit stress tolerance perspective, fatty acids are essential in membrane biogenesis, lipoic acid and cuticular wax synthesis and stress signalling  <cit> .

the candidate genes, identified in the present study, were significantly associated with qtls of grain yield, flowering time and leaf rolling under drought stress  thus confirming their associations with drought tolerance phenotype in pearl millet . such mapping of candidate genes also offer a range of possible links to the other physiological  <cit>  and agronomical  <cit>  traits including salt tolerance  <cit>  that co-map with the major lg <dig> dt-qtl region. similar approach has been used in other crops to find positional candidate genes underlying qtls  <cit> . for example, a molecular function map with  <dig> loci was constructed in potato based on  <dig> genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and transport to identify the candidate genes for tuber starch content  <cit> . similarly,  <dig> transcription factor genes were integrated on barley framework map and drought and cold tolerance qtls were positioned on the consensus map to find positional candidate transcription factors for drought and cold tolerance  <cit> . in the latter study, emphasis was given to transcription factors and upstream regulators, rather than to structural genes. in the present study, however, we have assembled sequences from both structural and transcription factor genes to gain a more complete picture of the distribution of abiotic stress genes around pearl millet dt-qtl interval and across the genome.

CONCLUSIONS
the present molecular function map of pearl millet represents an important step towards identification of candidate genes for abiotic stress qtls and for other agriculturally important traits that have been mapped in this species. further, it provides a means to anchor maps across different pedigrees and the basis for in silico comparative genetic mapping. the positions of previously reported major qtls for drought tolerance on the present map have revealed some interesting positional candidates. currently, we are studying polymorphisms of these lg <dig> candidate genes in a pearl millet inbred germplasm association panel which will further validate their associations with drought tolerance related traits across wider germplasm of the species. our future work also involves functional validation of these candidate genes using approaches such as over-expression, anti-sense suppression and  double-stranded rna interference in knock-out mutants and transgenics.
