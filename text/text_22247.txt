BACKGROUND
neurogenic bladder following spinal cord injury as well as paralysis is a major medical problem that has social implications due to quality of life issues  <cit> . urogenital diseases including urinary tract infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality although many complications are now decreasing with improved management  <cit> . the present goals of the management of neurogenic bladder in patients with spinal cord injury are the preservation of the renal function and increasing the quality of life for patients by minimizing complications  <cit> , but the restoration of bladder function after spinal cord injury has proven to be difficult to achieve because techniques in axonal regeneration and tissue repair remain quite limited until now.

recently research efforts have focused on attempts to regenerate the injured spinal cord using neurotrophic factors and drug delivery systems  <cit> , biomaterials  <cit>  and cell transplantation  <cit> . stem cell transplantation is one of the most promising fields for spinal cord regeneration because stem cells can achieve fundamental regeneration of injured spinal cord by replacing damaged neuronal tissues  <cit>  and it has the potential to be combined with various biomaterials for co-transplantation with neurotrophic factors  <cit> . mesenchymal stem cells have potential for various therapeutic applications and are clinically attractive for spinal cord repair since they can be obtained easily from adult bone marrow, blood or adipose tissue cells. as well, autograft transplantation does not induce immune rejection. several in vivo studies revealed that mscs transplanted into the central nervous system can be transdifferentiated into astrocytes and neurons as well as tissues from mesodermal origin  <cit> , and are effective in the partial recovery of locomotor function after damage to the central nervous system  <cit> . clinical trials of autologous hmsc transplantation were performed on acute and chronic patients with spinal cord injury  <cit>  and the safety and some clinical improvements for human were reported but the exact mechanism of hmscs on the functional recovery are still unclear  <cit> .

endogenous neurotrophic factors in the spinal cord and bladder are considered to promote neuronal survival and axonal growth after spinal cord injury  <cit>  and the administration of exogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor  and neurotrophin- <dig>  has been reported to contribute to the regeneration of damaged neuronal cells, improvement of paralyzed hindlimb function as well as neurogenic bladder after spinal cord injury  <cit> .

nevertheless there is no report revealing the relationship between the recovery of locomotor function or neurogenic bladder after hmsc transplantation and the status of endogenous neurotrophic factors in the spinal cord or bladder in spinal cord injury models. therefore the purpose of these experiments was to reveal the effects of hmsc transplantation on the recovery of neurogenic bladder and locomotor function in animal models of spinal cord injury and investigate the relationship between these results and the level of endogenous neurotrophic factors in the spinal cord and bladder.

RESULTS
hindlimb functions
basso, beattie, and bresnahan  scale, coupling score and ladder score showed gradual restoration in all hmsc and two control groups throughout the  <dig> days following spinal cord injury. repeated measure anova revealed that there was no difference between the time groups sacrificed at  <dig> days and  <dig> days following transplantation  until  <dig> days following transplantation within the same transplantation group .

bbb scale of hmsc group were higher than those of two control groups which received phosphate-buffered saline  or human fibroblasts  at post-transplantation day   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , and coupling score of hmsc group were higher than those of two control groups only at ptd <dig> . ladder score in all experimental periods exceeding ptd <dig> revealed that the erroneous step rate of hmsc group was reduced more than those of two control groups .

bladder volume and urodynamic study
urodynamic study at ptd <dig> and ptd <dig> revealed that all the bladder in hmsc and two control groups was hyperreflexic type , and there was no difference of micturition frequency and pressure, the chance of detrusor contraction without micturition, and bladder volume among hmsc group and two control groups .

ptd: post-transplantation day, pbs: control group received phosphate-buffered saline, hfb: control group received human fibroblast, hmsc: experimental group received human mesenchymal stem cell * by one-way avova, ** by fisher's exact test, † no. of detectable cases 

elisa study
when comparing the protein levels of bdnf and nt- <dig> among two control groups and hmsc group, there was no significant difference of the concentration of bdnf and nt- <dig> in thoracic and lumbar spinal cords and bladder between hmsc and control groups at ptd <dig> and ptd <dig> .

rt-pcr
rt-pcr was performed to injured thoracic spinal cord and lumbar spinal cord, and the levels of bdnf or nt-3/β-actin were not different among two control groups and hmsc group regardless of experimental periods  .

immunohistochemistry
we found that hmscs were well stained with anti-human nucleus antibody  in vitro  and hn-positive cells existed within the injured thoracic spinal cord of hfb group at ptd <dig>  and hmsc group at ptd <dig>  and ptd <dig> . but hn and anti-gfap antibody  or anti-beta iii tubulin antibody at ptd <dig>  and ptd <dig>  in hmsc group were not double-stained, thus transplanted hmscs into injured spinal cord did not differentiated into neurons nor astrocytes  <dig> and  <dig> days after transplantation. fifty six days after transplantation, total number of hn-positive cells per section was higher in hmsc group than in hfb group at ptd <dig> .

we checked the boundary of host tissue surrounding the injured area indirectly by gfap staining showing host astrocytes and macrophages by ed <dig> staining in the sagittal section of epicenter area . pbs and hfb groups showed larger cavities and fewer gfap-positive areas than hmsc group in the injured area at ptd <dig> and ptd <dig> . ed <dig> positive macrophages were significantly fewer near the center of injured spinal cord in hmsc group  than in pbs and hfb groups.

discussion
neuronal cells within the injured area are directly damaged just after trauma in the spinal cord and the secondary injury, caused by the inflammatory process through activations of macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes, leads to cavity and scar formation which usually exaggerates the damage  <cit> . clinical management for reducing the amount of cellular damage from secondary injury consists of steroid application within  <dig> hours after spinal cord injury. steroids are the only class of drug which has been tested for clinical use in spinal cord injury and widely used in treatment of such cases  <cit> , but it also has some detrimental effects including the risk for infections and gastrointestinal complications  <cit> . inflammation process following spinal cord injury has both beneficial and detrimental effects  <cit>  but several in vivo studies revealed that the inhibition of inflammation promoted improvements in motor and sensory functions  <cit> . we found that macrophages in the injured spinal cord area were significantly less in hmsc group than in control group, therefore transplanted mesenchymal stem cells may act to control the inflammatory process following spinal cord injury.

stem cells such as embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells and mscs were investigated in injured spinal cord regeneration  <cit> . mscs were the first type of stem cells used to treat patients  <cit>  and the only one stem cells whose safety has been established until recently  <cit> . the mechanism of msc for the functional improvement following spinal cord injury is not clear but several possible explanations have suggested. mscs can be transdifferentiated into neurons and glial cells  <cit> , and they are able to act as a physical guidance for neurofilament outgrowth in the injured spinal cord  <cit> . but the functional properties of transdifferentiated neurons are still controversial in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo studies  <cit> . we could not observe that any neurons or glial cells differentiated from hmscs existed within the injured area of the spinal cord in our study. the reduction of inflammatory process within the injured spinal cord resulting in the consequential decrement of secondary injury upon hmscs transplantation may be related with functional restoration following spinal cord injury, but we did not observe any significant improvement of locomotor and bladder function. the exact mechanism of how transplanted hmscs affect inflammatory reaction following spinal cord injury is not clear however it is known that mscs could reduce the inflammatory process in animal lung  <cit> .

wilkins et al.  <cit>  found that hmscs from bone marrow secreted bdnf and these cells also promoted neuronal survival in vitro, where similarly crigler et al.  <cit>  revealed hmscs could express transcripts encoding bdnf and β-ngf but not nt- <dig> and nt- <dig> in vitro and promoted neurite outgrowth within dorsal root ganglion explants. mahmood et al. <cit>  and kim et al.  <cit>  transplanted rat or human mscs into an in vivo model of traumatic brain injury and found that expression of bdnf, nt- <dig> and/or nerve growth factor were increased. kim et al. also found some functional improvements in the hmscs transplanted group  <cit> . in our study, we checked the amount of bdnf and nt- <dig> mrnas and proteins at  <dig> days and  <dig> days following hmscs transplantation in the spinal cord and bladder and no change was observed following transplantation regardless of the experimental periods. we performed elisa and rt-pcr at chronic stage of spinal cord injury  but we were not able to ascertain whether the level changes occurred in acute or subacute stages. the level of bdnf and nt- <dig> in hmsc transplanted group did not differ from those in control group  <dig> days after transplantation in a previous study  <cit> , and the increments of the amount of neurotrophic factors including bdnf within the injured spinal cord occurred within  <dig> to  <dig> days following transplantation  <cit> . the application of exogenous bdnf following spinal cord injury could enhance locomotor recovery in some studies  <cit> , therefore limited recovery of locomotor function after hmsc transplantation may be related with unchanged level of bdnf in our study.

previous in vivo studies evaluating the effect of hmsc transplantation into injured spinal cord have focused on the functional changes in motor and sensory impairments following transplantation  <cit> , but they did not evaluate autonomic function including neurogenic bladder. mitsui et al. found some improvements in the neurogenic bladder of rats following spinal cord injury after transplantation of neural stem cells or precursor cells  <cit> , and temeltas et al. also reported some improvements of lower urinary function after rat mscs transplantation  <cit> .

in our study, neurogenic bladder was not recovered in the hmsc group compared with control group until  <dig> days after transplantation. bladder dysfunction following spinal cord injury was severe enough not to recover spontaneously in control group which hindlimb function however showed gradual spontaneous recovery throughout the  <dig> days following spinal cord injury. therefore hmscs alone were likely insufficient to restore bladder function in this study.

the level of neurotrophic factors may also have the possibility of affecting bladder function. mitsui et al.  <cit>  has made a modified moderate contusion model, the same model in our study, where bdnf and nt- <dig> secreting fibroblasts were transplanted into the spinal cord and found that the neurogenic bladder was partially improved showing decrement of detrusor pressure and hyperreflexia  <dig> days following transplantation. they revealed that exogenous bdnf and nt- <dig> play an important role in repairing neurogenic bladder following spinal cord injury of rats  <cit> . in our study, endogenous bdnf and nt- <dig> levels in the spinal cord and bladder were unchanged after hmscs transplantation and these results may explain unrecovered neurogenic bladder.

limitation of our experiment was that we did not check the bdnf and nt- <dig> mrna and protein levels at acute or subacute stages as mentioned earlier. we found that stem cell transplantation was not sufficient to restore adequate function of motor, sensory and autonomic systems following spinal cord injury in this study, therefore other methods including biomaterials for control and differentiation of transplanted stem cells and directionality of regenerating axons, neurotrophic factors for the growth of neurons and glial cells, in addition to drug delivery system for effective transport of stem cells or neurotrophic factors, should be developed and utilized in combination for successful regeneration of the injured spinal cord.

CONCLUSIONS
our study showed that the transplantation of hmscs into the injured spinal cord of the modified moderate contusion model could reduce inflammation following spinal cord injury. but locomotor improvement was not obvious and neurogenic bladder and mrna and protein levels of bdnf and nt- <dig> were unchanged after stem cell transplantation.
