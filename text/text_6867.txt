BACKGROUND
the phytohormone auxin is critical for plant growth and development, regulating vascular development, apical dominance, tropic responses, and organ patterning by modulating cell division and elongation  <cit> . changes in gene expression are among the earliest molecular responses to auxin. many auxin-responsive transcripts fall into one of three classes: gh3-related, auxin/indole-3-acetic acid , and small auxin-up rna  transcripts  <cit> . common to many of these auxin-responsive genes is a sequence in the upstream regulatory region termed the auxin-responsive element .

auxin response factor  proteins are transcription factors that bind auxres . depending on the nature of the central domain, arf family members can either activate or repress transcription  <cit> . arf proteins can form homodimers, dimers with other arf proteins, or dimers with transcriptionally repressive aux/iaa proteins  <cit> . many aux/iaa proteins directly prevent transcriptional activation by interacting with activating arf proteins  <cit> .

many aux/iaa transcriptional repressors are unstable  <cit>  and are degraded even more rapidly following auxin application  <cit> . rapid aux/iaa degradation following an auxin stimulus is thought to free activating arf proteins from repression, allowing auxin-responsive gene expression. mutant screens for decreased auxin sensitivity have identified several aux/iaa proteins with stabilizing mutations . also isolated from auxin-response screens were trans-acting mutations that likewise stabilize aux/iaa proteins, revealing the degradation mechanism for these repressors. several auxin-resistant mutants have defects in the scftir <dig> e <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex, as well as its regulatory components .

transport inhibitor response <dig>  and the other auxin signaling f-box  family members are the substrate-recognition components of scf complexes that bind auxin and promote the degradation of aux/iaa repressor proteins  <cit> . auxin is trapped in the tir <dig> auxin-binding pocket by an interacting aux/iaa protein  <cit> . subsequent 26s proteasomal degradation of aux/iaa proteins relieves the repression of the arf protein, allowing auxin-responsive transcription  <cit> . this novel receptor-ligand interaction allows a very short signal transduction chain that may facilitate rapid transcriptional responses to auxin. in addition, rub  modification of the cullin subunit of scftir <dig> is necessary for auxin response  <cit> . mutations in axr <dig> and ecr <dig>  which encode subunits of the rub-activating enzyme  <cit> , result in decreased auxin responses accompanied by slowed aux/iaa protein degradation  <cit> , presumably because of reduced scftir <dig> efficacy in targeting these proteins for degradation.

normal auxin responses require active movement of auxin through the plant, which is controlled by specialized influx and efflux carriers . auxin resistant <dig>  is an auxin influx carrier protein that allows certain auxins to enter cells  <cit> . mutations in aux <dig> result in resistance to iaa and  <dig> -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid   <cit> , which are substrates of the aux <dig> transporter  <cit> .

a variety of natural and synthetic auxins and auxin precursors have activity in auxin bioassays  <cit> . a mutation in iba response <dig>  was identified in a screen for resistance to the inhibitory effects of the auxin precursor indole-3-butyric acid  on root growth  <cit> . subsequent analyses revealed that ibr <dig> mutants are less sensitive not only to iba, but also to all tested forms of auxin and to the phytohormone abscisic acid   <cit> . ibr <dig> encodes a putative dual-specificity protein phosphatase, and the ibr5- <dig> mutation causes a premature stop codon that would result in a truncated product lacking the conserved phosphatase domain  <cit> . here, we examined the role of ibr <dig> as a phosphatase in vivo by expressing a mutant version of ibr <dig> predicted to be catalytically inactive in the ibr <dig> mutant and found that phosphatase activity is likely required for full ibr <dig> function. through double mutant analyses, we found that ibr <dig> enhanced most tir <dig> defects and a subset of axr <dig> and aux <dig> defects. further, we demonstrated that ibr <dig> is defective in accumulation of an auxin-responsive reporter following auxin treatment. because this reporter accumulates after degradation of aux/iaa transcriptional repressors, we examined the effect of the ibr <dig> lesion on a reporter of aux/iaa stability and an epitope-tagged aux/iaa protein and, interestingly, found that these reporters were not stabilized in ibr <dig> 

RESULTS
ibr <dig> enhances tir <dig> auxin-response defects
the tir <dig> mutant, like ibr <dig>  <cit> , is less responsive to auxin in primary root elongation inhibition and lateral root formation assays  <cit> . to examine the genetic interaction between ibr <dig> and tir <dig>  we crossed tir1- <dig> to ibr5- <dig> and examined the phenotypes of the resulting double mutant. we found that tir <dig> ibr <dig> plants were shorter than either parent . ibr <dig> cotyledon vascularization defects were sometimes mildly enhanced by tir <dig> . in addition, the tir <dig> ibr <dig> double mutant displayed enhanced resistance to root elongation inhibition by  <dig> -d and iba , fewer lateral roots in response to iba treatment , and greater resistance to iba inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in the dark  than either parent.

in addition to auxin resistance, ibr <dig> mutant roots are resistant to the phytohormone aba  <cit> . we found that tir <dig> also exhibited aba resistance, and that tir <dig> ibr <dig> roots were more aba resistant than either single mutant . because ibr5- <dig> is likely to be a null allele  <cit> , these results support a model in which ibr <dig> and tir <dig> act separately to affect auxin and aba responsiveness.

ibr <dig> enhances certain axr <dig> auxin-response defects
the axr <dig> mutant displays more extreme auxin-response defects than tir <dig> or ibr <dig>  with restricted plant height, reduced apical dominance, dramatic vascularization defects, striking auxin resistance, and a longer root than wild type on unsupplemented media  <cit> . to examine the genetic interaction between axr <dig> and ibr <dig>  we crossed axr1- <dig> to ibr5- <dig>  the double mutant had similar plant height to axr1- <dig> , but leaf epinasty  and cotyledon vascular defects  were more extreme in axr <dig> ibr <dig> compared to either parent. further, axr <dig> ibr <dig> had a longer root on unsupplemented media than either parent , consistent with the possibility that resistance to endogenous auxin was enhanced. resistance to the auxins  <dig> -d and iba was not obviously enhanced in the double mutant when considering the longer root on unsupplemented media . moreover, axr <dig> ibr <dig> did not display enhanced resistance to iba-induced lateral root formation , but did exhibit slightly enhanced resistance to the inhibition by iba of hypocotyl elongation in the dark . like ibr <dig>  axr <dig> is resistant to aba inhibition of root elongation  <cit> , and axr <dig> ibr <dig> had similar aba resistance as both parents .

ibr <dig> enhances aux <dig> root elongation defects
the aux <dig> mutant displays marked resistance to the auxins that are brought into cells by the aux <dig> transporter, such as  <dig> -d and iaa  <cit> , but responds normally to 1-naphthaleneacetic acid , which is not transported by aux <dig>  <cit> . although iba does not appear to be an aux <dig> substrate  <cit> , the aux <dig> mutant is moderately iba resistant  <cit> , probably because the iba that enters cells is converted to iaa. aux <dig> mutant roots are agravitropic and longer than wild-type roots on unsupplemented media  <cit> , but aux <dig> aerial parts resemble wild type. to examine the genetic interaction between aux <dig> and ibr <dig>  we crossed ibr5- <dig> to aux1- <dig>  although aux <dig> plants attain normal height, adult aux <dig> ibr <dig> plants were shorter than either parent . moreover, aux <dig> ibr <dig> seedlings had longer roots on unsupplemented media than either parent . resistance to the auxins  <dig> -d and iba was not obviously enhanced in the double mutant when considering the longer root on unsupplemented media and the complete resistance of aux <dig> to the concentrations of  <dig> -d tested . we examined lateral root production in aux <dig> ibr <dig> and found that aux <dig> did not markedly enhance ibr <dig> defects . similarly, the ibr <dig> cotyledon vascular development defects did not appear to be enhanced by aux <dig> . hypocotyls of dark-grown aux <dig> responded like wild type to iba, and aux <dig> ibr <dig> responses resembled those of ibr <dig> . aux <dig> was unresponsive to the aba concentrations tested ; thus we did not determine if ibr <dig> enhanced aux <dig> aba resistance.

ibr <dig> displays reduced auxin-responsive reporter accumulation
ibr <dig> seedlings grown on unsupplemented medium display reduced accumulation of dr5:gus  <cit> , a construct in which the gus reporter is driven from a synthetic auxin-responsive promoter  <cit> . we compared wild-type and ibr <dig> dr5:gus auxin responses in roots of light-grown seedlings and hypocotyls of dark-grown seedlings. two-hour treatments with various auxins increased dr5:gus activity in wild-type roots  and hypocotyls . in contrast, ibr <dig> showed reduced induction of dr5:gus activity following auxin treatment in both roots and hypocotyls .

this reduced induction of dr5:gus activity suggests that ibr <dig> misregulates at least some auxin-regulated transcripts. thus, we examined basal levels and auxin responsiveness of endogenous iaa <dig>  iaa <dig>  and gh <dig>  transcripts in wild-type and ibr <dig> seedlings. although we detected subtle reductions in basal levels of iaa <dig> and iaa <dig> transcripts in ibr <dig> in several trials , we did not detect dramatic differences in these experiments. in any case, iaa <dig>  iaa <dig>  and gh <dig>  transcripts eventually reached similar maximal values in wild type and ibr <dig> , suggesting that ibr <dig> is not required for full response to high auxin levels.

ibr <dig> does not accumulate an axr3/iaa <dig> reporter protein
gain-of-function mutations that stabilize any of several aux/iaa proteins can confer dominant auxin resistance . moreover, aux/iaa repressor proteins or aux/iaa-reporter fusion proteins are stabilized in numerous other auxin-resistant mutants, including tir <dig>  <cit> , axr <dig>  <cit> , ecr <dig>  <cit> , afb <dig>  afb <dig>  and afb <dig>  <cit> , cul <dig>  <cit> , eta2/cand <dig>  <cit> , eta3/sgt1b  <cit> , and aar <dig>  <cit> .

because auxin-responsive transcripts are reduced in ibr <dig>  we sought to analyze aux/iaa stability in the ibr <dig> mutant. we crossed ibr5- <dig> to a line expressing the axr3/iaa <dig> aux/iaa protein n-terminal degron region fused to β-glucuronidase driven by a soybean heat-shock promoter . eight-day-old seedlings were heat shocked to induce reporter transcription, and then either mock treated or auxin treated. in seedlings with intact auxin signaling, the auxin-induced disappearance of axr3nt-gus activity reflects the targeting of the reporter to the 26s proteasome for degradation  <cit> . mutants with auxin-response defects, such as tir <dig> and axr <dig>  show increased reporter activity after induction and reduced destabilization of axr3nt-gus upon auxin treatment  <cit> , consistent with the axr <dig> defect in accumulating normal levels of auxin-responsive transcripts following auxin treatment  <cit> . intriguingly, unlike in previously characterized auxin-response mutants, we did not detect increased axr3nt-gus activity in ibr <dig>  in fact, axr3nt-gus appeared to be less active in ibr <dig> than in wild-type roots  <dig> or  <dig> minutes following heat shock . this decrease in axr3nt-gus activity was also apparent in tir <dig> ibr <dig>  suggesting that ibr <dig>  although enhancing tir <dig> auxin resistance in root elongation , suppressed tir <dig> axr3nt-gus accumulation . response to  <dig> -d for each of these lines was as expected, with tir <dig> ibr <dig>  showing enhanced resistance compared to the intermediate resistance of either parent .

the reduced axr3nt-gus activity in ibr <dig> was apparent immediately following the 2-hour heat shock used to induce reporter expression . because a heat-responsive promoter drives the axr3nt-gus construct, we tested whether the lack of axr3nt-gus activity in ibr <dig> could be explained by a reduced transcriptional response to heat in the mutant. we introduced a construct altered to contain the stabilizing axr3- <dig> mutation  into ibr5- <dig> by crossing. the proline to leucine substitution in axr3- <dig>  <cit>  confers reporter stability by decreasing axr3-1nt-gus interaction with scftir <dig>  <cit> . we found similar axr3-1nt-gus activity in wild type and ibr <dig> with or without auxin treatment , suggesting that the transgenes were efficiently transcribed in response to the heat stimulus, and that the decreased axr3nt-gus activity in ibr <dig> was not caused by reduced transcription following heat shock. moreover, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor mg <dig> restored axr3nt-gus activity in ibr <dig> and tir <dig> ibr <dig> to near wild-type levels , again suggesting that the ibr <dig> defects in axr3nt-gus activity were not due to reduced transgene transcription.

ibr <dig> does not accumulate an iaa <dig> reporter protein
iaa <dig> was originally identified because the iaa28- <dig> gain-of-function mutation confers auxin resistance and impedes lateral root production  <cit> . like typical aux/iaa proteins, iaa <dig> has a transcriptional repressor domain  <cit>  and can confer auxin-enhanced instability to a luciferase reporter  <cit> . to test whether the lack of axr3nt-gus stabilization in ibr <dig> was accompanied by stability effects on other aux/iaa proteins, we crossed ibr5- <dig>  tir1- <dig>  and axr1- <dig> to a wild-type line carrying a c-myc epitope-tagged version of iaa <dig> driven from iaa <dig> regulatory sequences  and isolated homozygous mutants carrying the reporter transgene. these lines responded to  <dig> -d as expected . because iaa <dig> is primarily expressed in roots  <cit> , we examined accumulation of iaa28myc in wild-type and mutant roots following mock- or auxin-treatment of 10-day-old seedlings. as expected, we found that iaa28myc disappeared rapidly following auxin treatment in wild type . we found lower iaa28myc levels in ibr <dig> than wild type in the absence of added auxin; this protein disappeared rapidly upon auxin treatment and was not detected after  <dig> minutes of treatment . although we had expected iaa28myc to be stabilized in tir <dig> and axr <dig>  we found iaa28myc levels similar to wild-type levels that decreased in response to auxin treatment  in both mutants, consistent with the observation that neither of these mutants is completely insensitive to auxin . we examined iaa <dig> mrna levels in these lines and found reduced iaa <dig> transcript levels in axr <dig> and, to a lesser extent, in tir <dig> . transcript levels were not perfectly correlated with iaa <dig> protein levels, suggesting differences in protein stability in these mutants. treatment with mg <dig> increased iaa28myc protein levels in both wild type and ibr <dig> , suggesting that iaa28myc is degraded via the 26s proteasome in wild type and consistent with the possibility that the proteasome contributes to the reduced iaa28myc levels in ibr <dig>  however, the inability of mg <dig> to fully restore iaa28myc to wild-type levels in ibr <dig>  suggests that the reduced iaa <dig> mrna level in ibr <dig>  contributes to the reduced iaa28myc accumulation in this mutant . the striking lack of axr3nt-gus and iaa28myc stabilization in ibr <dig> is consistent with the possibility that auxin-regulated transcription is reduced in ibr <dig> via a mechanism that does not involve aux/iaa protein stabilization.

an ibr <dig> substitution variant  does not fully rescue ibr <dig> defects
dual specificity protein phosphatase  proteins dephosphorylate both threonine and tyrosine residues of phosphorylated proteins, often thereby inactivating them . dsp proteins contain a conserved aspartate residue and a separate, highly conserved signature motif of vxvhcx2gxsrsx5aylm, with the cysteine and arginine residues participating with the conserved aspartate in catalysis. the cysteine of this signature begins the dephosphorylation process with a nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom of the phosphotyrosine or phosphothreonine substrate. thus, disruption of this conserved cysteine results in catalytic inactivity in many dsp proteins , including the ibr <dig> relative, dsptp <dig>  <cit> .

the dsp active site motif vxvhcx2gxsrsx5aylm is present in ibr <dig> , allowing us to identify the presumptive active site cysteine  in ibr <dig>  to test whether ibr <dig> phosphatase activity is required for normal auxin responses in vivo, we generated transgenic wt and ibr5- <dig> lines expressing a cys <dig> → ser <dig>  substitution variant of ibr <dig>  under the control of the strong 35s viral promoter. we anticipated that 35s:ibr5c129s would not rescue ibr5- <dig> defects if ibr <dig> phosphatase activity were required to promote auxin responsiveness. we assayed ibr5- <dig>  lines expressing low  and high  ibr5c129s levels  for mutant phenotype rescue. wild-type and ibr5- <dig> lines overexpressing unmodified ibr <dig>  were used for comparison.

we found that ibr <dig> or ibr5c129s overexpression did not noticeably alter wild-type adult morphology . moreover, ibr <dig> or ibr5c129s overexpression in wild type did not alter any of the hormone-response phenotypes examined . as expected, we found that ibr5- <dig>  plants were restored to wild-type height  and had normal root responses to auxin and aba . ibr5- <dig>  line a  exhibited restored plant height but had similar leaf epinasty to ibr5- <dig>  whereas ibr5- <dig>  line b  displayed rescue of ibr5- <dig> plant height  and partial rescue of leaf epinasty . resistance to the inhibitory effects of  <dig> -d and aba on root elongation was not rescued in ibr5- <dig>  line a and only partially restored in ibr5- <dig>  line b . the lack of full ibr5- <dig> rescue by ibr5c129s is consistent with the possibility that ibr <dig> phosphatase activity is required for full auxin and aba responsiveness. the partial ibr5- <dig> rescue observed when ibr5c129s accumulates to high levels suggests that certain ibr <dig> functions do not require phosphatase activity. for example, ibr5c129s may bind and sequester its substrate, thereby dampening normal substrate activity.

discussion
loss-of-function mutations in ibr <dig>  which encodes a putative dual-specificity protein phosphatase , result in decreased auxin and abscisic acid responses  <cit> . dsp proteins often regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase  proteins. arabidopsis has  <dig> predicted mapk proteins  <cit>  but only five predicted dsp proteins, suggesting that some dsp enzymes may regulate more than one mapk. in arabidopsis, two of the five predicted arabidopsis dsp proteins have been demonstrated to regulate mapk activity. dsptp <dig>  dephosphorylates mpk <dig>  <cit> , and mapk  phosphatase <dig>  dephosphorylates mpk <dig> and mpk <dig>  <cit> .

although a mapk regulated by ibr <dig> has not been reported, mapk signaling has been implicated in both auxin and aba responses, and both of these pathways are defective in ibr <dig>  for example, transient expression in protoplasts of constitutively active mapk kinase kinase protein anp <dig> or the tobacco homolog npk <dig> results in decreased auxin-responsive transcription and activation of atmpk <dig> and atmpk <dig>  <cit> , the targets of the mkp <dig> phosphatase  <cit> . additionally, auxin treatment activates a ~44-kd mapk in arabidopsis  <cit> . the failure of ibr5c129s to fully restore ibr5- <dig> mutant phenotypes indicates that ibr <dig> phosphatase activity is required for full auxin and aba responsiveness, and it will be interesting to learn if any of the map kinases implicated in hormone responsiveness are ibr <dig> substrates. the partial rescue of ibr <dig> defects observed when ibr5c129s was overexpressed might result from the ibr5c129s protein binding to and thus sequestering ibr <dig> substrate, as has been suggested for overexpression of the catalytically inactive mapk phosphatase pyp1c470s, which results in a phenotype similar to a loss-of-function allele of the substrate mapk spc <dig> in schizosaccharomyces pombe  <cit> .

in an effort to clarify the pathways through which ibr <dig> affects auxin responses, we examined genetic interactions between ibr <dig> and the auxin-response mutants tir <dig>  axr <dig>  and aux <dig>  the tir <dig> f-box protein acts with aux/iaa proteins as an auxin receptor  <cit> . tir <dig> appeared to enhance all ibr <dig> auxin-related physiological phenotypes examined, including response defects to applied natural and synthetic auxins  and auxin transport inhibitors . in addition, the tir <dig> ibr <dig> mutant displayed a longer primary root  and fewer lateral roots than either single mutant on unsupplemented medium , suggesting that the double mutant has enhanced resistance to endogenous auxin as well.

in addition to influencing auxin responses, ibr <dig> modulates certain aba responses  <cit> . we found not only that tir <dig> enhanced ibr <dig> aba resistance, but also that tir <dig> itself exhibited substantial aba resistance in the root elongation assay . although tir <dig> has not previously been reported to be aba resistant, it has been characterized as glucose resistant  <cit> , a phenotype common to many aba-resistant mutants . because tir <dig> ibr <dig> displays enhanced resistance to both auxin and aba, and because the ibr5- <dig> allele is a likely null  <cit> , these results are consistent with the possibility that tir <dig> and ibr <dig> promote auxin and aba responsiveness independently of one another.

axr <dig> is a subunit of the rub-activating enzyme involved in rub modification of cullin proteins. cullin is the backbone for the over  <dig> putative scf complexes in arabidopsis  <cit> , including scftir <dig>  <cit> ; therefore, axr <dig> mutants have pleiotropic phenotypes, including auxin resistance. the only examined phenotypes that appeared to be additive in axr <dig> ibr <dig> were the long primary root on unsupplemented media and aberrant vascular development . unlike ibr <dig>  tir1- <dig> enhances the root elongation resistance of axr1- <dig> to  <dig> -d  <cit> . the pleiotropic nature of the axr <dig> defect and the extreme auxin resistance of the axr <dig> single mutant complicate the interpretation of our results. regardless, it is interesting that axr <dig> and ibr <dig> mutants, which are both less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of auxin on root elongation, seem to have opposite effects on axr3nt-gus stability .

we also examined double mutants of ibr <dig> with aux <dig>  a mutant defective in an auxin influx carrier  <cit> . the shoots of the aux <dig> ibr <dig> mutant resembled ibr <dig>  whereas the roots of aux <dig> ibr <dig> were most similar to aux <dig>  because aux <dig> lacks shoot phenotypes and most aux <dig> root phenotypes are more dramatic than ibr <dig> root defects, these results are consistent with results expected from additive defects, although the extreme resistance of aux <dig> to  <dig> -d and aba prevented us from determining whether aux <dig> ibr <dig> had additive defects in response to these hormones.

ibr <dig> has decreased dr5:gus activity when grown on unsupplemented media  <cit> , and in this study we found defects in auxin-induced dr5:gus activity in particular tissues . however, microarray analysis of mrna accumulation in 7-day-old ibr <dig> and wild-type seedlings did not reveal any dramatic  alterations in transcripts represented in the analysis  <cit> . these results suggested that any gene expression changes in ibr <dig> might be subtle or local, as in the dr5:gus analysis, and therefore not apparent in whole seedling rna.

because auxin-response transcripts are regulated by aux/iaa protein stability, we sought to analyze aux/iaa degradation in ibr <dig>  auxin promotes aux/iaa protein degradation by mediating interaction of these repressors with scftir <dig>  <cit> . several auxin-resistant mutants exhibit stabilized aux/iaa proteins or aux/iaa reporters, including mutants defective in the auxin receptors tir <dig>  <cit>  and the related afb <dig>  afb <dig>  and afb <dig> f-box proteins  <cit> ; other scf components such as cul <dig>  <cit> ; and proteins that modify scf activity, such as axr <dig>  <cit> , ecr <dig>  <cit> , eta3/sgt1b  <cit> , and eta2/cand <dig>  <cit> . this stabilization probably accounts for the reduced levels of auxin-responsive transcripts reported in many of these mutants  <cit> . like previously characterized auxin-response mutants, ibr <dig> exhibits reduced accumulation of the auxin-responsive dr5:gus reporter. unlike these other mutants, however, axr3nt-gus activity was not increased in ibr <dig>  moreover, iaa28myc protein was less abundant in ibr <dig>  which is not expected if aux/iaa proteins are generally stabilized, also suggesting that ibr <dig> modulates auxin-responsive transcription without stabilizing aux/iaa proteins. of course, there are  <dig> arabidopsis members of the aux/iaa family  <cit> , and it remains possible that ibr <dig> specifically stabilizes certain aux/iaa family members to reduce transcriptional activation without affecting axr3/iaa <dig> or iaa <dig> stability.

regardless of whether aux/iaa proteins that remain to be assessed turn out to be stabilized in ibr <dig>  ibr <dig> is the only examined auxin-response mutant  <cit>  that does not exhibit axr3nt-gus stabilization. this phenotypic bifurcation may be useful in dissecting the roles of additional auxin-response mutants. recent experiments suggest that the myb <dig> transcription factor promotes auxin responses and can dimerize with arf proteins  <cit> . it will be interesting to learn whether aux/iaa proteins are stabilized in the myb <dig> mutant and whether ibr <dig> regulates this or some other factor needed to promote auxin-responsive transcription once the aux/iaa repressors have been degraded. one of many possible scenarios is that ibr <dig> normally dephosphorylates and inactivates a mapk that negatively regulates a transcription factor needed for auxin responses, providing a mechanism to fine-tune auxin responses without modulating aux/iaa stability.

CONCLUSIONS
ibr <dig> resembles dual-specificity phosphatases, and in this work we provide evidence that ibr <dig> phosphatase activity is necessary for full auxin and aba responsiveness. analysis of double mutants between ibr5- <dig> and several other auxin-response mutants revealed that ibr <dig> appears to affect auxin responses independently of the tir <dig> auxin receptor. because transcriptional repression of auxin-responsive genes is relieved by aux/iaa protein degradation, we examined the stability of two aux/iaa reporters in ibr <dig> and found that these proteins were not stabilized in ibr <dig>  suggesting that ibr <dig> acts downstream of auxin recognition by the scftir1/afb-aux/iaa complexes. future determination of ibr <dig> substrates may allow a more detailed understanding of how this apparent dual-specificity phosphatase is able to promote auxin responses without destabilizing aux/iaa proteins.
