BACKGROUND
brucella spp. causes brucellosis, a zoonotic disease still endemic in many countries of the world. this infectious disease affects different animal species and is transmitted to humans in several ways, the most common through ingestion of raw milk or other unpasteurized dairy products. the preferred ecological niche for the brucellae is within phagosomal compartments of host macrophages; the capacity of this bacterial pathogen to establish and maintain chronic infections is dependent upon its ability to replicate within these phagocytic cells  <cit> . brucella belongs to the alpha- <dig> subdivision of the proteobacteria and they are therefore phylogenetically related to the plant cell-associated species of the genera rhizobium and agrobacterium  <cit> .

a wide variety of environmentally and medically important bacteria produce the enzyme urease , which catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea, leading to the production of carbon dioxide and ammonia  <cit> . this enzyme allows many soil bacteria to use urea as a nitrogen source. urease is also an important virulence factor that improves survival of pathogenic bacteria under acidic conditions within the host and can also cause direct damage to the host tissue due to ammonia, co <dig> or alkali production  <cit> . interestingly, some species of rhizobiales, such as brucellae and bradyrhizobium btai <dig> show multiple urease clusters  <cit> . this reiteration so far is found in other bacterial species, namely streptomyces coelicolor, s. avermitilis, pseudomonas syringae and escherichia coli  <cit> .

several bacterial ureases have already been purified and characterized  <cit> . one of the most studied ureases is from helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that is able to persist in the stomach where the ph is very acidic  <cit> . urease activity is an important colonization factor by generating ammonia in the immediate bacterial microenvironment, thus protecting h. pylori from the deleterious effects of gastric acid  <cit> . furthermore, urease activity appears to be responsible for the acid resistance of the invasive enteric pathogen yersinia enterocolitica  <cit> . interestingly, some humans have a genetic predisposition to develop reactive arthritis following a y. enterocolitica infection, which correlates to their serum reactivity with the ureb subunit of yersinia urease  <cit> .

the present work describes the purification as well as the enzymatic and phylogenomic characterization of urease from brucella suis strain 1330; in addition, the urease reactivity of sera from patients diagnosed with brucellosis was examined. to our knowledge, no brucella urease has been previously purified and characterized. since brucella is a human pathogen, it is important to obtain as much information as possible to complement databases, such as brenda  <cit> . these results can then be used by experimentalists and modelers to understand, from a systems biology point of view  <cit> , the mode of action of enzymes in the pathogen and how that can be modified in order to develop new disease treatments.

RESULTS
urease was purified from the soluble extract of b. suis  <dig> using two consecutive chromatography steps that resulted in the final isolation of a homogeneous enzyme . as previously reported in the case of mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> , hydrophobic-interaction chromatography was consistently the most useful method to purify b. suis urease. the urease was purified 51-fold, with a recovery of 12% of total urease activity and  <dig> % of the total protein .

purification data refers to a single preparation, obtained in a representative experiment. the enzyme was purified by ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatographies. enzyme activity was determined using a spectrophotometric coupled assay with glutamate dehydrogenase. details are provided in methods section.

urease activity was always eluted as a single symmetrical peak at  <dig> mm nacl during anion exchange chromatography, and eluted at  <dig> mm of nh4so <dig> in hydrophobic interaction chromatography. during the chromatographic purification, all fractions were measured for urease activity and consistently produced one activity at the same salt concentrations. the purified protein showed a specific activity of  <dig> u/mg. this is in the range of urease specific activities described for other organisms: from very low –  <dig> u/mg for rhodobacter capsulatus  <cit>  – to as high as  <dig> u/mg in brevibacterium ammoniagenes  <cit> .

an sds-page analysis of the purified enzyme revealed the presence of three protein bands with apparent molecular masses of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  da; the low molecular weight bands were poorly stained in contrast to the large subunit . the stoichiometry of the subunits in bacterial ureases has been the subject of considerable investigation. separation of individual subunits by sds-page and integration of the staining intensities for the multiple bands reveal near-integer values for the subunits stoichiometries, but these ratios vary for the enzymes from different sources. it is likely that all ureases possess equal numbers of each or their distinct subunits polypeptides  <cit> . the molecular weight of the native enzyme obtained by gel filtration on superose was 130– <dig> kda, while molecular weight obtained by nondenaturing zymograms gels, appeared as one prominent band with a molecular weight of  <dig> ±  <dig> kda . bacterial native ureases show a range of molecular weights from  <dig> kda in s. salivarius  <cit>  to  <dig> –  <dig> kda in h. pylori  <cit> . the isoelectric point was  <dig> , very similar to the  <dig>  value of urease from proteus penneri  <cit> . the predicted molecular weight for the three subunits of b. suis urease operon 1: ure-a <dig> , ure-b <dig>  and ure-c <dig> , the total molecular weight expected is  <dig>  da, this result is very closed with the molecular weight obtained in the polyacrylamide gradient non-denaturing gel if b. suis urease could be in a dimer form . molecular weights higher than expected for the three subunits in the denaturing polyacrylmide gel could be a product of aberrant running. differences between results in gel filtration chromatography compared with polyacrylamide gradient non-denaturing gel could be a product of different conformation of the standard proteins and the possible multimeric conformation of the b. suis urease.

b. suis urease activity was present between ph 6– <dig> but activity decreased sharply below ph  <dig>  recently the optimal ph of b. abortus urease was determined as  <dig>   <cit> . similarly, the ureases from sthaphylococcus saprophyticus, s. salivarium, ureaplasma urealyticum, and m. tuberculosis have a neutral optimum ph between  <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> . in contrast, the ureases from l. reuteri, l. fermentum, l. ruminis, and s. mitior exhibit acidic optimal ph values of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> , while h. pylori and k. aerogenes have a slightly alkaline ph of  <dig>   <cit> . we assayed urease activity in tris-hcl buffer at ph  <dig> , as suggested by dunn and co-workers  <cit> . although tris has been described as an inhibitor of urease, a simple control experiment comparing the activity in tris-hcl and the synthetic buffer hepes, showed no significant difference .

in terms of temperature stability, ureases from different species of lactobacillus have a very high optimal temperature between  <dig> to 65°c  <cit> , and m. tuberculosis is stable between  <dig> to 60°c but is inactivated above 60°c  <cit> . b. suis urease was active between 10–45°c, and it was almost completely inactivated above 45°c. the optimal activity was observed between 28–35°c, temperatures that are close to the corporal temperature of humans and other animals who are hosts for this pathogen.

the kinetic study of b. suis urease showed a simple michaelis-menten-type kinetic behavior , in accordance with what has been described for ureases from other organisms  <cit> . the km obtained by hyperbolic regression was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm, and a very similar value  was obtained with the still widely used lineweaver-burk or double reciprocal plot . hence, b. suis urease shows a higher affinity for its substrate than the enzymes from b. abortus   <cit> , p. mirabilis  or providencia stuartii   <cit> , but less affinity than h. pylori whose urease has one of the lowest km values  reported  <cit> . a limited correlation may exist between the value of this kinetic constant and the ecological niche of the host organism. for example, h. pylori inhibits the gastric mucosal lining, where low concentrations of urea are present ; such a low kinetic constant would allow this urease to function under close to saturation conditions despite the low substrate concentration. in contrast, microorganisms that are exposed to large amounts of urea such as are found in the urinary tract or in the soil typically possess ureases with higher km values, such as  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig> mm observed for the enzymes from p. mirabilis, sporosarcina ureae, and bacillus pasteurii, respectively  <cit> .

several compounds have been described as inhibitors of urease . these are potentially important to control urease related pathogenesis of bacterial infections and in enhancing the efficiency of urea fertilizers  <cit> . we tested the inhibitory effect of three of these compounds, hydroxyurea and thiourea, substrate analogues, and aha. both hydroxyurea and thiourea show a competitive type of inhibition , with ki of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for hydroxyurea and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for thiourea. these results agree well with what is described for ureases from other bacteria: the enzyme from k. aerogenes is inhibited by thiourea with a ki >  <dig> mm, and hydroxyurea is a competitive inhibitor of the brevibacterium ammoniagenes urease with a ki of  <dig>  mm  <cit> . for aha, we used a similar approach and obtained a competitive inhibition with ki of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm. aha has been described as a potent inhibitor of ureases from bacteria and other microorganisms  <cit>  and the study of urease from jack bean and k. aerogenes revealed that aha is a slow-binding competitive inhibitor with a very low ki,  <dig>  –  <dig> μm  <cit> . our results confirm that aha is an inhibitor of b. suis urease, with a lower ki than thiourea and hydroxyurea. to test aha as a slow binding inhibitor is beyond the scope of this study.

due to the low protein concentration of the low molecular weight bands , it was not possible to sequence them. since the active urease apoenzyme consists of urea, ureb and urec, it is likely that the smaller bands correspond to urea and ureb. in the case of  <dig> kda protein, we obtained the amino acid sequence mparisratyaqm; this sequence matched with b. suis urec <dig> subunit .

during the last years, several immunoreactive brucella proteins have been identified and evaluated against animal and human serum samples  <cit> . it is well known that urease is the most abundant protein of h. pylori and as a result it serves as a significant immunogen and is useful in diagnostic tests. patients with active gastritis due to h. pylori show significantly elevated immunoglobulin g and a sera titers to the urease  <cit> . in the current study, b. suis urease was tested for reactivity with human sera from patients with acute and chronic brucellosis by western blot analysis. the igg antibodies in sera from patients with acute and chronic brucellosis reacted against the large subunit while the lower molecular weight subunits were not recognized. it is possible that the smaller subunits  did not react because their concentration was too low or that they are not immunogenic. as expected, healthy individuals were seronegative for reactivity to the urec <dig> . this is somewhat analogous to the serum reactivity of patients recovering from y. entercolitica infections in which the ureb subunit is recognized  <cit> .

although the sequenced genomes of the brucella spp. have two urease operons , it appears that only one is responsible for encoding an active urease. in the case of b. abortus, tn mutagenesis produced mutations of ure- <dig>  but not ure- <dig>  resulting in decreased urease activity  <cit> . similarly, in the case of b. suis, the disruption of the urec <dig> or ureb <dig>  genes does not affect measurable urease activity in b. suis  <cit> . thus, it is perhaps not unexpected that the urease purified in this study was identified as that encoded by urec <dig> based on n terminal amino acid sequencing. moreover, the serum from humans diagnosed with brucellosis also reacted with urec <dig> and supports the mutational studies that only the ure- <dig> operon is used to produce urease during a brucella infection. it is also noteworthy that the serum from patients infected with y. enterocolitica also shows reactivity to the ureb subunit and is a candidate antigen involved in the induction of reactive arthritis in the same patients  <cit> . this rea syndrome is also a typical side effect of a significant proportion of patients who have been infected with brucella  <cit>  or with a number of other pathogens acquired through the gastro-intestinal tract  <cit> . the question remains: why are the bacterial ureases so immunodominant and are they responsible, at least in part, for the induction of rea as suggested by the arthritogenic peptide theory  <cit> .

psi-blast comparisons showed that urec <dig> from b. suis has 99% of similarity with either the putative urec <dig> from b. melitensis or urec <dig> from b. abortus . also, high similarity values were obtained by comparison with the alpha subunits from m. loti , r. leguminosarum , s. meliloti  and a. tumefaciens . in contrast, the comparison with urec <dig> from b. suis, b. melitensis and b. abortus , yielded lower values . to find the relationships of the multiple urease clusters of b. suis, we carried out a phylogenetic and structure analysis with ureases from bacterial species with unique or multiple clusters.

the phylogenetic tree deduced for b. suis urec <dig>  grouped it within the rhizobiales order . the closely related clades included the typical urec from other alpha , beta , and gamma  proteobacterial species. however, in the other main clade, the urec <dig>  was grouped with yersinia and photorhabdus species, both from the gamma proteobacteria subdivision . the unexpected phylogenetic relationship of cluster  <dig> possibly reflects a horizontal gene transfer event, because both brucella and yersinia share the niche , are classified as facultative intracellular pathogens and can replicate inside macrophages  <cit> . in a closely related clade appeared two urec from bradyrhizobium btai <dig>  and one from pseudomonas syringae strain b728a . a similar explanation of horizontal gene transfer could be applied, because these species are common inhabitants of the soil and the plant rhizosphere. also in this group were the urec subunits of the distant actinobacteria species streptomyces coelicolor and s. avermitilis.

interestingly, the main group relationships observed in the phylogenetic tree for urec were also revealed in the structures of the urease clusters. in the alpha proteobacteria subdivision , the rhizobiales and b. suis, the cluster  <dig> structure has the order uredabcefg . a slight variation, with the structure uredabcfg, is present in b. japonicum, in one of the clusters of bradyrhizobium strain btai <dig> , in some gamma proteobacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa  and in one of the two clusters of p. syringae strain b728a; in two last species, the urefg genes are located several genes downstream. a second main structure, with the order ureabcefgd, was shared by b. suis cluster  <dig> and the yersinia pestis, y. pseudotuberculosis and photorabdus luminiscens clusters and with one of the clusters of streptomyces coelicolor and s. avermitilis . lastly, a third structure was found with the order ureefcgd. this structure was present in two of the clusters of bradyrhizobium strain btai <dig>  and in one cluster of p. syringae strain b728a. in this case  symbolizes the fusion of urea and ureb genes. in streptomyces coelicolor and s. avermitilis the urease clusters consist of only urec genes. the conservation of the cluster and the coherence with the phylogenetic tree among the analyzed species suggests a coordinated evolution of genes and clusters and, perhaps, a relationship between origin and function.

CONCLUSIONS
we have for the first time purified and characterized an active urease from b. suis. the enzyme was characterized at the kinetics, immnunological and phylogenetic levels. our results confirm that the active urease of b. suis is product of ure- <dig> operon.
