BACKGROUND
a dramatic increase in the elderly population is a predominant demographic change in industrialized countries; therefore aging-related diseases such as chronic kidney disease  are becoming an increasingly important medical issue for modern societies  <cit> . by  <dig>  20% of the us population will be 65 years and older. in the european union, the percentage of adults over 60 years of age will increase to 33% of the population by  <dig>  <cit> . due to aging-induced structural and functional tissue alterations as well as underlying diseases such as diabetes and arterial hypertension, the incidence of ckd will dramatically increase in the future  <cit> . ckd mleads to end-stage renal disease and is associated with an elevated overall as well as cardiovascular mortality, therefore constituting a considerable health and economic burden  <cit> . understanding the mechanisms that contribute to the aging-associated decline in renal function will help to develop novel therapeutic and, more importantly, preventive strategies.

kidneys of older patients exhibit morphological changes such as glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis  <cit> . the expression of immune genes is increased in aged human kidneys  <cit> , and senescent cells are known to exhibit a proinflammatory phenotype  <cit> . altered levels of tgf-ß, egf, igf- <dig>  and vegf have been described in aging kidneys  <cit> . tubulointerstitial inflammation, fibrosis, loss of kidney weight, and cortical thinning with a decrease of functional nephrons are well-known consequences of aging  <cit> . starting at the age of  <dig> to 40 years, glomerular filtration rate  shows a decline of at least  <dig>  ml/min/ <dig>  m <dig> per year and 6 ml/min/ <dig>  m <dig> per decade  <cit> . aging-associated alterations also affect tubular and endocrine functions of the kidney.

dna damage induced by oxidative stress plays a key role in the aging-associated decline of renal function  <cit> . chronic renal failure has been liked to defects in dna damage repair. dna maintenance mechanisms such as interstrand crosslink  repair and nucleotide excision repair  are essential to protect cells from dna damage. deficiencies in single ner proteins, specifically those implicated in the transcription-coupled repair  subpathway of ner, are known to induce severe progeroid syndromes. many of these mutants display accelerated aging with shortened lifespan, progressive features of cachexia, kyphosis, retinal degeneration, renal abnormalities and neurological impairment. among these disorders are cockayne syndrome which is caused by mutations in ercc <dig>  or ercc <dig> , trichothiodystrophy  caused by mutations in ercc <dig> , ercc <dig> , or ttda  and xpf-ercc <dig> progeria  caused by dysfunction of the xpf-ercc <dig> heterodimer  <cit> . ercc <dig> forms an endonuclease together with xpf that mediates 5’ incision of a damaged dna strand. furthermore, ercc1/xpf is involved in icl repair and homologous recombination  <cit> . ercc <dig> knockout mice  are runted and suffer from severe progressive neurological abnormalities, kyphosis, and hepatic as well as renal nuclear abnormalities. they die before weaning at the age of  <dig> to 5 weeks due to hepatic insufficiency. a modified ercc <dig> knockout mouse model expressing a liver-specific ercc <dig> rescue transgene to prevent hepatic insufficiency shows an increased lifespan of 12 weeks. interestingly, these animals develop proteinuria at 3 weeks of age and progress to end stage renal failure with uremic encephalopathy  <cit> . thus, ercc <dig> might play an important role in maintaining adequate renal function.

in order to extend lifespan of these mice to 6 months and to facilitate more extensive studies, weeda et al. established a hemizygous ercc1-deficient mouse model  <cit> . these mice harbor one loss-of-function allele and one hypomorphic allele that encodes a truncated protein lacking the last seven amino acids . ercc1-/Δ mice exhibit tubular abnormalities, whereas glomerular function and morphology have not yet been investigated  <cit> . since reduced ercc <dig> function leads to a premature aging phenotype, we hypothesized that this mouse model might be suitable to study molecular mechanisms of glomerular aging. the premature aging phenotype holds the promise for facilitated specimen generation and simplification of study design compared to labor- and time-consuming aging studies in wt animals. furthermore, animals with conditional ercc <dig> alleles are available to allow for cell-type-specific induction of aging in the kidney  <cit> .

therefore, we analyzed gene expression profiles of young and aged wild-type  glomeruli and compared these profiles to young and old progeroid ercc1-/Δ glomeruli in order to examine the extent to which aging-related expression changes are recapitulated in the accelerated aging model. we now demonstrate that glomeruli of ercc1-deficient mice reflect important aspects of physiological glomerular aging. our analysis provides the first global view of the contribution of genome maintenance pathways to the prevention of glomerular aging.

RESULTS
identification of genes differentially expressed between young and old wt and ercc1-/Δ mice
ercc1-/Δ mice show pronounced premature aging with male mice achieving a median lifespan of 19 weeks and a maximal lifespan of 26 weeks and female mice reaching a median lifespan of 21 weeks and a maximal lifespan of 29 weeks respectively  <cit> . the median and maximal life span of their male wt siblings is  <dig> and 156 weeks  <cit> . to identify genes expressed in glomeruli that are associated with kidney aging, genome-wide transcriptome analyses were performed. 80% of the cohort is still alive at  <dig> wks for ercc1-/Δ and at  <dig> wks for wt animals. we hypothesized that  <dig> wk old wt animals were more suitable to be compared to  <dig> wk old ercc1-/Δ animals than  <dig> wk old wt animals. since wt mice are weaned at the age of 3 weeks, a  <dig> wk old mouse is still adolescent whereas a  <dig> wk old mouse can be regarded as a young adult animal. bioinformatic analysis revealed about  <dig> differentially expressed genes between age groups  in both wt and ercc1-/Δ mice. gene expression changes of a set of genes that were significantly differentially expressed in the gene array experiments were quantitatively verified by quantitative pcr . we compared the expression pattern of glomerular tissue from young  and old  ercc1-/Δ mice to the expression pattern of glomerular tissue from young  and old  wt mice using whole-transcriptome microarrays. using venn diagrams, we found a surprisingly large overlap of  <dig> genes where only  <dig>  genes would be expected by chance alone . to address the question whether not only the genes themselves were identical but also the direction of regulation was the same in the two backgrounds we employed fc-fc plots  . this analysis revealed  <dig> genes elevated at older age in wt and ercc1-/Δ mice and  <dig> genes decreased under both conditions. only two genes were regulated in opposite directions between wt and ercc1-/Δ glomeruli.

in order to decrease the potential flaw in our gene expression analysis, we subtracted all genes regulated in wt glomeruli between  <dig> and 14 weeks of age from the initially created gene set of differentially expressed genes between  <dig> and 96 weeks of age . these genes are hypothesized not to be regulated in an aging-dependent manner, but as a consequence of development and organ maturation . after subtraction,  <dig> regulated genes were shared by both wt and ercc1-/Δ glomeruli . by chance alone, only  <dig>  genes would be expected to intersect between both lists . among these  <dig> genes,  <dig> were upregulated in both groups, and  <dig> genes were downregulated. only a single gene was upregulated in wt and downregulated in ercc1-/Δ mice, shown by the fc–fc plot in figure 1d .

principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering reveal similar aging-associated changes in gene expression of wt and ercc1-/Δ glomeruli
we performed principal component analysis  on the transcriptomes of wt  <dig> and  <dig> wk old glomerular tissue and ercc1-/Δ  <dig> and  <dig> wk old glomerular tissue using the gene list of wt genes after subtraction of early differentially expressed genes in order to reduce the original high-dimensional data set into a set of pcs. intriguingly, the first principal component mainly reflects mouse age , while the second principal component can be explained by the different genotypes . the eigenvalues essentially represent the variance explained by the principal components. the eigenvalue is almost  <dig> times higher for the first pc, indicating that the predominant factor driving transcriptional changes in this experiment is the animals’ age rather than the genotype. our results confirm the similarity of transcriptional profiles of aged wt and aged ercc1-/Δ datasets versus young wt and young ercc1-/Δ datasets by showing a similar age-dependent shift on the level of the first principal component. a pca using wt as well as ercc1-/Δ gene lists with similar results is shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig> 

presumably, the  <dig> differentially expressed genes of the maturation-adjusted gene set in wt mice  reflect physiological aging-associated transcriptional changes in our analysis. unsupervised hierarchical clustering of this gene set using euclidean distance and complete linkage to analyze the similarity of expression profiles between aged wt and ercc1-/Δ glomeruli showed cluster formation of the young wt samples with young ercc1-/Δ glomerular samples. old ercc1-/Δ glomerular samples show intermediate clustering . hierarchical clustering of the combined maturation-adjusted gene set of wt glomeruli and the differentially expressed gene list in ercc1-/Δ mice showed clearly, that old wt samples cluster with old ercc1-/Δ samples, and young wt samples cluster with young ercc1-/Δ samples .

we repeated hierarchical cluster analysis of all regulated genes in old wt mice without maturation adjustment revealing the same association of samples . again, old samples clustered together, and young samples clustered together when using the whole list of all  <dig> differentially regulated genes in old wt mice as well as old ercc1-/Δ mice  without maturation adjustment .

these findings clearly show that 14 week old ercc1-/Δ glomeruli, on the transcriptional landscape, do not resemble glomeruli of wt mice of the same age, but rather those of aged 96 week old wt mice, pointing out that premature aging in ercc1-/Δ glomeruli shows features of physiological glomerular aging.

the progeria mouse model ercc1-/Δ and wt aged mice share common molecular pathways
to better understand whether common pathophysiologic mechanisms would explain these transcriptional changes in aged mice, we performed gene ontology  analyses and visualized the data with cytoscape  <cit>  . corresponding gene names are given in additional file 5: table s <dig>  and additional file 6: table s <dig> . our results reveal significant functional similarities between aged wt and aged ercc1-/Δ glomeruli. immune response genes, defense response genes, inflammatory response genes, response to wounding genes, genes regulating cell death, cell killing, cytolysis and apoptosis, chemotaxis, protein maturation and cation homeostasis were equally regulated in both aged glomerular tissues. go analysis of only the  <dig> overlapping genes between wt and ercc1-/Δ is shown in figure  <dig>  gene names are given in additional file 7: table s <dig>  most strikingly, immune response genes were regulated in both old wt and old ercc1-/Δ glomeruli. some of these genes are already known to be associated with aging. toll-like receptor  <dig>  was found to exhibit increased expression in aged mouse brain  <cit> , and chemokine receptor  <dig>  has been associated with atherosclerosis and alzheimer’s disease  <cit> . protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type c  shows increased expression levels in older healthy subjects  <cit> . cd <dig> expression is regulated in aged rats  <cit> , and its expression is also increased in pima indians with diabetic nephropathy. in this model, cd <dig> expression was localized to podocytes  <cit> .

the most striking difference between aged wt and aged ercc1-/Δ glomeruli was the prominent regulation of genes related to cell cycle, mitosis, organelle fission, and cell division . this finding is expected since ercc <dig> plays a major role in genome maintenance processes such as nucleotide excision repair and dna crosslink repair. therefore, genes involved in cell cycle regulation and cell division are expected to be regulated in this model. gene names of differentially expressed genes in wt, ercc1-/Δ and overlap genes are given in additional file 5: tables s <dig>  additional file 6: table s <dig> and additional file 7: table s <dig>  a list of genes encoding slit diaphragm proteins is given in additional file 8: table s <dig> 

similarities and differences in gene regulation of aged wt and ercc1-/Δ glomeruli by network analysis
to confirm similarities in gene regulation between aged wt and aged ercc1-/Δ glomeruli we performed network analyses. mapping the list of differentially regulated genes on the human interactome with the netbox software revealed additional networks similarly regulated in aged wt and aged ercc1-/Δ glomeruli . both figures display similarities regarding insulin signaling, chemokine/cytokine signaling, and extracellular matrix and complement signaling. a network analysis of only the  <dig> regulated overlapping genes in wt and ercc1-/Δ glomeruli also nicely shows the particular networks regulated in both aged glomerular datasets .

as anticipated, the most striking difference between wt and ercc1-/Δ glomeruli was the differential regulation of genes responsible for cell cycle and cell division. our dna repair gene model revealed immune effector pathways as the main overarching principle of the aging phenotype.

discussion
we studied gene expression patterns of young and old wt mice glomeruli and compared these patterns to a mouse model of dna damage and premature aging. beyond pathways that are expected to play a role in glomerular aging such as apoptosis, proteolysis, and insulin signaling, we found gene regulatory networks involved in immune response, defense response, and inflammatory response mechanisms to be regulated in the aging glomerulus of both wt and ercc1-/Δ mice. these data clearly demonstrate that the progeroid ercc1-/Δ mouse model provides a helpful tool for future studies on aging-associated glomerular changes. however, addressing the detailed mechanism underlying glomerular aging in this strain will require additional studies that characterize the cell-specific expression of the genes identified within the glomerulus on the one hand. on the other hand – since we focused on transcriptional changes – an analysis of glomerular protein expression using proteomics holds the great potential to add to a better understanding of the consequences of the transcriptional changes on both protein levels and posttranslational modifications. on a functional level detailed histological examination of the mutant glomeruli will help to assess the role of immune cell invasion, cell death and alterations in the glomerular ultrastructure in the phenotype observed.

in our analysis, overlapping genes were part of insulin signaling, chemokine and cytokine signaling as well as extracellular matrix pathways. moreover, our results xindicate that ercc1-/Δ mice – based on the transcriptional profiles – can be employed as a model of glomerular aging. large-scale aging studies are significantly impaired by the difficulty in obtaining sufficient material due to the necessity of aging cohorts. using prematurely aged mutant strains holds the promise to dramatically facilitate these studies. nonetheless, it is crucial to determine whether these models are appropriate for examining the physiology of aging in a certain tissue. furthermore, aging goes along with highly complex systemic changes. as for kidney deterioration, the cardiovascular system has tremendous impact on renal function and physiology. using aged mouse cohorts or patient samples allows for studying the physiological processes of aging but as to tissue-specific and cell-intrinsic mechanisms, the data will always be impacted by the systemic confounders.

the aging process of an individual is characterized by the accumulation of progressive dna lesions. ercc <dig> is essential for genome stability, protecting cells against the consequences of a variety of endogenous and exogenous dna damage through dna repair. ercc1-deficient mice exhibit a phenotype of premature aging  <cit> . in ercc <dig> knockout animals rescued for their severe lifespan-limiting, aging-related liver pathology, proteinuria and progressive chronic kidney disease are suggestive of a role of ercc <dig> in glomerular cell biology  <cit> . ercc <dig> is involved in human disease. a child with mutations in xpf/ercc <dig> displayed a unique combination of progeroid symptoms and died from kidney failure at the age of 16 years  <cit> . a second child, compound heterozygous for two ercc <dig> mutations, showed mild renal hypoplasia  <cit> . due to the severe phenotype of ercc <dig> knockout mice, we decided to employ mice expressing the hypomorphic ercc <dig> allele  as a putative model for glomerular aging biology  <cit> . when analyzing differentially expressed genes during the aging process in both wt and ercc <dig> mice the majority of regulated genes only exhibited a small change in expression levels as already described before  <cit> . the process of aging is probably not induced by the dysregulation of a small number of cellular pathways but rather a complex interplay between subtle changes in a variety of different cellular functions leading to senescence and cellular malfunction with age  <cit> . studying only one pathway to elucidate aging-associated processes may thus be insufficient since one pathway might only contribute marginally to the whole picture of aging. additionally, gene expression changes in aged tissues might also reflect adaptive responses.

exploring associated go term annotations, we identified striking similarities but also some differences between wt and ercc1-/Δ. we were able to detect pathways that are expected to play a role in glomerular aging, such as regulation of apoptosis and proteolysis which has been previously described  <cit> . we also found that many differentially expressed genes are involved in immune response, defense response, and inflammatory response mechanisms. these pathways are also expected to play a role in aging processes, as already described by de magalhães et al. <cit>  . brink et al. compared aging processes of mouse brain, heart and kidney tissue and identified differentially expressed genes being part of immune and inflammatory response pathways, apoptosis and protein metabolism, such as caspi, irak <dig>  cd <dig>  dock <dig>  and icam <dig>  <cit> . in our study, casp i and cd <dig> were also differentially expressed in our aged glomerular samples. analyzing human renal tissue, rodwell et al. revealed that genes differentially displayed with age were expressed in b cells, t cells and neutrophils  <cit> . it can be speculated that immune response pathways influence the aging process in wt as well as in ercc1-/Δ <dig> glomerular tissue. whether these genes are expressed by cells having invaded the glomerulus or by resident glomerular cells such as mesangial cells, endothelial cells or podocytes has not been determined yet.

in a transcriptional analysis of human whole kidney samples at three different age groups by melk et al., genes involved in extracellular matrix turnover, energy metabolism and mitochondrial function were differentially expressed in old kidneys  <cit> . these genes were not significantly regulated in our aged glomerular samples possibly reflecting the differences between whole kidney tissue and glomerular tissue, or expressing species differences. in our study, we identified additional genes involved in matrix turnover. osf-2/periostin was significantly downregulated in old glomerular tissue samples. periostin is known to play a role in glomerulosclerosis and renal interstitial fibrosis  <cit> , both entities are associated with aging. interestingly, these authors also identified genes involved in non-specific inflammatory responses to play a role during the aging process. chronic organ injury is known to induce a focal increase in b cell content. this infiltration might occur due to increased fibrosis and atrophy and/or altered cytokine expression profiles of aged resident renal cells. since this finding has been observed in several studies  <cit> , elucidating the mechanism of immune cell infiltration with aging is important for future studies on tissue aging processes.

as expected, differences between wt and ercc1-/Δ mice could also be demonstrated in this analysis due to the underlying genetic defect in ercc1-/Δ mice. mainly genes involved in cell cycle and cell division were differentially expressed in ercc1-/Δ mice, but not in wt mice. nevertheless, our data demonstrate a significant overlap of aging-associated genes in the two different mouse models. in our analysis, gene expression was not dominated by genotype-specific changes that might override subtle age-related changes in gene expression. in old ercc1-/Δ mice, changes owing to the aging process were more prominent than those brought forth by the underlying genotype. this is not always found in other studies. as an example, amador-noguez at el. analyzed gene expression profiles from young versus old liver samples of long-lived ames dwarf and little mice. in their study, they observed that gene expression changes due to the underlying genotype were more dramatic than changes due to age itself  <cit> .

the identification of the ercc1-/Δ background as a genetic tool for the induction of glomerular aging holds a great potential for future studies of glomerular aging. first, use of this model – due to the premature aging phenotype at 14 weeks of age - highly facilitates this research which is often impaired by difficulties in maintaining large cohorts of aged mice. second, it is now within reach to induce aging in a cell-specific manner by using conditional alleles of ercc <dig> <cit> . thus it will be possible to dissect glomerulus-intrinsic aging from systemic effects due to cardiovascular changes and aging of the renal microvasculature on the one hand. on the other hand cell-specific aging within the glomerulus can now be addressed to examine the hypothesis that assumedly post-mitotic cells as the podocytes are major contributors to aging-related pathologies.

aging is a complex process. a better understanding of the molecular biology involved in aging-related pathologies is the pre-requisite for developing novel ways of tackling aging-related disease. we already know that interventions such as dietary restriction or certain drugs such as rapamycin can increase lifespan and organismal stress resistance. nevertheless – in order to take advantage of these phenomena in the clinical setting – the underlying molecular mechanisms will need to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
our results identify insulin signaling, apoptosis, proteolysis and pathways involved in immune response, defense response and inflammatory response mechanisms to be involved in glomerular aging. their overlap provides evidence that molecular aging processes in ercc1-deficient mouse glomeruli are comparable to those in wt glomeruli. in the future, ercc1-/Δ mice can be used as a model system to study aging of the glomerular filtration system.
