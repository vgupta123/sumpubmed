BACKGROUND
during the life cycle of hbv, rt utilizes a single-stranded viral genomic rna as a template to synthesize a hybrid rna-dna duplex, and then converts it to double-stranded dna . as this step is critical for the viral genome replication, it makes rt an attractive target for antiviral treatment. thus, both nucleoside and nucleotide rt inhibitors  and non-nucleoside rt inhibitors  are extensively used as antiretroviral agents against hbv and hiv infection  <cit> .

the effective hbv nrtis are nucleoside or nucleotide analogs that can be phosphorylated to their diphosphate or triphosphate active forms by intracellular kinases. active forms of nrtis incorporate into the elongating dna strand, terminate the elongation of the nascent dna strand, and prevent additional dntps from being incorporated. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate  is an oral prodrug of nucleotide analog tenofovir -2-propyl]adenine). tdf is rapidly converted to tfv following absorption and is readily catalyzed to the active diphosphate form, tfv-dp   <cit> .fig.  <dig>

tdf is a non-selective rt inhibitor with demonstrated in vitro activity against both wild-type and mutant strains of hiv  and is also effective for treating chronic hepatitis b  . while resistance mutations within the hbv-rt have been identified for nrti monotherapies, such as adefovir, entecavir, lamivudine, telbivudine and clevudine  <cit> , there is no evidence of tdf resistance  <cit> . however, differential therapy responses can be observed among patients and have been previously defined: a delayed viral clearance response in slow responders , or a rapid decline in viral load immediately following treatment initiation in rapid responders   <cit> .

tfv resistance in the setting of hiv has been extensively studied at the molecular level . these studies have shown that the molecular mechanism of tfv resistance is complex and involves reverse transcriptase, rnase and exonuclease activities of hiv-rt. in order to remain functional, resistant mutants of hiv-rt need to maintain their capability of incorporating nucleotide at a sufficient rate, as well as to discriminate against nrtis or improve the excision rate of incorporated nrtis  <cit> .

as the hbv-rt is homologous to hiv-rt  <cit> , it is reasonable to propose that a similar mechanism could be involved in the differential treatment response to tdf. whether and/or how the molecular level interaction between tfv-dp and hbv-rt has a part in the aforementioned differential patient responses upon tdf treatment is unclear due to the lack of direct experimental evidence. there is no solved structure of the hbv-rt in any form.

in this study, we set out to address the molecular level interaction between tfv-dp and hbv-rt and the relationship to patient response using a hybrid computational approach. we utilized two x-ray crystal structures of hiv-rt to model the atomic structure of hbv-rt in its functional state with the aim of delineating the detailed drug-protein interactions between tfv-dp and the active sites of genetically distinct variants of hbv-rt.

RESULTS
atomic structure models of the hbv-rt in its functional state
while substantial efforts have been devoted to solving the crystal structures of hiv-rt, with or without ligands , no experimentally derived hbv-rt structures have become available. hiv-rt and hbv-rt are recognized as homologous  <cit> , and possess similar multiple catalytic activities. a computational approach is often applied to structural implications in drug-resistance studies on hbv-rt using hiv-rt as structural template for homology modeling of hbv-rt  <cit> . still, the low sequence identity and modeling hbv rt without considering the particular functional state imposes technical difficulties in obtaining structural models of high confidence.

in models of nrtis bound to hbv-rt, it is reasonable to hypothesize that an effective drug binds to the active site as if it were a native substrate in position to be further covalently incorporated, similar to the hiv-rt/dna-dna/tfv-dp complex  <cit> . even though we are not to rule out the possibility of a nrti being able to bind elsewhere than the active site on hbv-rt or hiv-rt, to date there is no evidence for such type of interaction. moreover, a putative strong binding of the drug to the active site would seem to preclude the likelihood of additional binding sites on the enzyme. to use constraints derived from experimental results to guide the refinement, we first modeled the hbv-rt structure itself using itasser  <cit>  with an additional template, the x-ray crystal structure of hiv-rt/dna-rna/datp  <cit> , and then included the native substrates  from this template complex in the subsequent refinement .

the c-scores  <cit>   of our hbv-rt models generated by itasser for the variants of interest indicated high confidence; however, we noticed that the exact folding patterns in the fingers domain differ . therefore, we chose the hbv-rt <dig> model  which has the same folding pattern as the hiv-rt template  in order to proceed with the refinement.

the structure of the n-terminal  <dig> amino acid region was of relatively low accuracy . thus, we re-modeled the n-terminal of hbv-rt <dig> separately using itasser, and assembled it with the rest of the protein using ab initio assembly  <cit> . the n-terminus in the resultant assembled structure of hbv-rt <dig> is of much more ordered secondary structural elements than it was in the initial model from itasser .

the assembled structure was then combined with the duplex dna-rna and datp from the template hiv-rt/dna-rna/datp crystal strcuture, refined by ~120 ns md simulation in explicit solvent to obtain the final model of hbv-rt4/dna-rna/datp.

after the md simulation, the centroid of the dominant cluster  from the second half of hbv-rt4/dna-rna/datp trajectory was chosen as the representative structure for hbv-rt in its functional state . the corresponding part from the hiv-rt/dna-rna/datp  is shown in gray surface representation for comparison. apart from the n-terminal domain partially protruding out of the template’s surface envelope, all the other domains  are in close agreement with the template structure . the dna-rna duplex is clamped by the enzyme through the circular arrangement of the thumb, palm and fingers domains. prior to entering the active site, the duplex is anchored by one α-helix  in the thumb domain. the rna template strand is tracked along by a long loop  connecting the palm and fingers domains, and captured by the fingers domain toward its 5’ end.fig.  <dig>

in preparation for incorporation, the datp situates itself in the active site with good base ring stacking to the penultimate dg, and by making two persistent hydrogen bonds  with the uracil from the opposing template rna strand ; these features persist throughout the un-constrained md . the triphosphate group of the datp is stably coupled with residue l <dig> and d <dig> of hbv-rt by cooperatively chelating one mg2+ . this particular configuration differs from the hiv-rt active site mainly by the absence of a third aspartate residue in the active site; in hiv-rt this third aspartate  participates in chelating the two mg2+ in the active site of the hiv-rt . without this aspartate, the mg2+ ions were stabilized over the equilibration stage of the md by incorporating extra water molecules, and this constellation remained stable throughout in the production run .

different roles of mg2+ ions in the active site
apart from the first mg2+  being directly involved in the datp binding to the active site, a second mg2+  is also present in the hiv-rt/dna-rna/datp crystal structure. due to an insufficiency of potential ligation atoms in the active site of hbv-rt comparing to hiv-rt, mg2+- <dig> can only be coordinated by five surrounding oxygens and mg2+- <dig> by only three, not considering contributions from water molecules postulated in our initial settings. in fact, water molecules filled in dynamically over the equilibration stage and stabilized the chelation as with the optimal octahedral configuration for mg2+ over the entire md simulation. to evaluate the stability of the chelation, we computed the moving average  of the distance from each non-water oxygen atom to the corresponding mg2+ over the non-constrained md simulation . the result shows a persistently stable coupling of the non-water atoms to the corresponding mg2+ ion .fig.  <dig>

while it is clear that the mg2+- <dig> bridges the interaction between the datp and rt , the importance of the mg2+- <dig> in these rts is open to question, as it is only mg2+- <dig> which appears in the hiv-rt/dna-dna/tfv-dp structure   <cit> . to address this question, md simulations with only the mg2+- <dig>  were also performed for all the hbv-rt variants. on one hand, we found no significant changes in binding affinities of datp to hbv-rt upon removal of mg2+- <dig> , which is consistent with the observation that the mg2+- <dig> is not directly involved in the substrate binding. on the other hand, it is noticeable that oxygen from the hydroxyl group of dg-3’ is directly involved in the chelation of the mg2+- <dig> throughout the simulation . since the nature of the incorporation of a dntp is to form a phosphodiester bond between the oxygen of the 3’-oh and the α-p of the triphosphate group of the dntp, the network formed by the two mg2+ ions is the optimal configuration for the impending chemical reaction. the distance between the oxygen of the 3’-oh and the α-p of the triphosphate group of the datp was also monitored for each of the hbv-rt variant over the simulations . as further separation of the 3’-oh and the α-p did not appear in any of our mg2+- <dig> only system, the mg2+ network seems to contribute to the function of the enzyme in a way other than merely maintaining the distance between the 3’-oh of the extending dna strand and the α-p of the datp. presumably, forming a coordination bond with the mg2+- <dig> would render the oxygen atom in the 3’-oh more favorable to initiation of the nucleophilic attack on the α-p, thereby flavoring the transcriptase activity of the enzyme.table  <dig> approximated binding free energies with standard errors of datp or tnv to hbv-rt/dna-rna using solvated interaction energy method 



binding free energy of tfv-dp to hbv-rt
drug resistance often arises from structural alterations consequent to mutations in the target protein, which somehow disrupts or interferes with drug binding. to understand the underlying mechanism of the differential response to tdf treatment, we start by asking whether the tfv-dp binds differently to the rt variants from patients with slow or rapid response to tdf. in building a structural model of hbv-rt4/dna-rna/tfv-dp, we started with the hbv-rt <dig> model generated by itasser and aida , then inserted the duplex dna-rna taken originally from the hiv-rt/dna-rna/datp template structure  <cit> , and finally incorporated the tfv-dp from the hiv-rt/dna-dna/tfv-dp structure   <cit> . models for the other four variants were built analogously from the homology models we obtained using the hbv-rt <dig> as template, into which the same dna-rna duplex and tfv-dp were incorporated. we then pursued md simulations to refine all the hbv-rt/dna-rna/tfv-dp structures. the centroid of the major cluster from the second half of each md trajectory was then chosen as representative model.

here we present the hbv-rt4/dna-rna/tfv-dp model. as seen in fig. 4a, the incorporation of the tfv-dp did not elicit any disruption of the secondary structural elements of the hbv-rt <dig>  the domain arrangement persists as they are in the hbv-rt4/dna-rna/datp complex , indicating the model is in a proper functional state. at the active site, the tfv-dp associates with the enzyme in the exact fashion as we identified in the natural substrate-bound complex: the base-ring end of the tfv-dp is anchored by two persistent h-bonds, and the triphosphate end of it is strongly coupled by the mg2+ chelation network . while mg2+- <dig> was missing in the hiv-rt/dna-dna/tfv-dp crystal structure , we believe that the integrity of the mg2+ network is important for maintaining the proper configuration of the active site, as is seen in the hiv-rt/dna-rna/datp crystal structure and in all of our hbv-rt/dna-rna/datp systems with two mg2+ ions. convinced of the potential catalytic role of the mg2+- <dig>  we opted to include the mg2+- <dig> in all of our hbv-rt/dna-dna/tfv-dp systems. the result that the mg2+ network is stable across all variants echoes the importance and validity of the addition.fig.  <dig>

we were then able to compute the binding energies of the datp and tfv-dp to the hbv-rt/dna-rna complex with extensive sampling of the complex structures through md simulations using the solvated interaction energies  method  <cit> . the favorable and consistent binding energies of datp to the variants observed in both mg2+ systems  indicate strong binding of the natural substrate to the enzyme, hence proper configuration of the active sites for all of our hbv-rt variant models. as for the tfv-dp ligand, the sie results also show favorable binding to all hbv-rt variants , with no substantial differences between them . these findings suggest that rt enzymatic activity and rt’s affinity to bind tfv-dp are not altered by the amino-acid heterogeneity observed among the hbv-rt variants examined herein, which, taken together with the observed stability of ligand-protein interactions and consistency in the structural configuration of the active site in all hbv-rt/dna-rna/tfv-dp complexes, suggest that factors other than a decreased binding affinity of hbv-rt to tfv-dp might be influencing therapy response in patients.

interestingly, evidence of there being no substantial changes in drug-binding affinity in our hbv-rt/dna-rna/tfv-dp complexes  is in agreement with our previous study  <cit> . a potential prediction model of response to tdf revealed that genetic diversity outside the rt domain of polymerase contributed robust predictive features strongly associated to sr/rr characteristics of patients, whereas in rt none were found  <cit> . moreover, a switch in high-frequency intra-host hbv variants was observed in patient  <dig>  which did not involve changes in rt. amino-acid substitution s202p  in the spacer domain of polymerase presented after 4 weeks of tdf treatment, suggesting a possible association between response to tdf and amino-acid heterogeneity in spacer, a suspected intrinsically disordered protein   <cit> . in fact, there is compelling evidence of the involvement of idps in evolution of drug resistance in cancer cells  <cit>  and hbv  <cit> . nevertheless, an association between amino-acid substitutions in hbv variants rt1–rt <dig> and differential response to tdf treatment cannot be dismissed solely based on findings presented herein. drug-binding affinity may not be the only mechanism involved in response rates or resistance to tdf. amino-acid substitutions observed in hbv-rt could be affecting some other structure-activity-resistance relationships. in addition, intramolecular conformational changes in rt and intermolecular dynamics of the rt complex provide an alternative mechanism for drug resistance to nnrtis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
while many drug resistant mutants of hbv-rt have been identified, very little is known about the molecular mechanism driving resistance development. compared to the massive structural and biochemical studies than have been conducted on hiv-rt drug resistant mutants, hbv-rt has not drawn much attention among structural biologists. however, over  <dig> million people have developed chb and it remains a serious, global health problem  <cit> . therefore, it is important to unravel the drug resistance associated with anti-viral treatment to hbv infections.

to probe the structural basis for hbv-rt drug resistance, researchers rely on structural modeling approaches using crystal structures of hiv-rt as a starting point . as protein structures are dynamic and strongly correlated with its functional states, we devised a novel hybrid approach in which we utilized the most relevant x-ray crystal structures  to model the initial structures of hbv-rt and then extensively sampled the conformational space with experimentally derived constraints  to select the final representative models . without direct experimentally derived structure data on hbv-rt to test the models, this rigorous approach presumably generates structure models of the highest confidence and relevance to the particular biological function of interest. however, as this approach comprises only physics-based methods, it is advisable to apply other methods to evaluate the resulting model from a different perspective. in this study, we have applied a statistical potential based method   <cit>  to evaluate our model. the resulting z-score for our hbv-rt <dig> model confirms good quality in terms of the naturalness defined by sets of x-ray and nmr structures , and the local quality plot indicates the majority of the hbv-rt <dig> model is of high quality measured by a knowledge-based energetic term .

using these models to probe drug-protein interaction, we focused on the tfv-dp binding. the present findings indicate that, despite sequence changes in or around the nrti binding site, favorable drug-protein interactions persisted. the dynamics of how key molecular groups interact, probed in our studies, reveal new insights into the mechanisms, through which hbv-rt couples to its natural substrate. however, this apparent drug-protein interaction stability leaves us without a good mechanistic rationalization as to why or how hbv-rt amino-acid polymorphisms may contribute to reduced rates of viral clearance responses to tdf treatment, as is often observed in sr patients.

the modeling approach presented in this study can be extended to other drugs and serve as a paradigm to ascertain drug binding and estimate binding free energies. it is important to note that the starting conformation  would have much effect on the results. therefore, it is essential to start modeling using all available information for the accurate and reliable prediction of the binding site structure.
