BACKGROUND
kinesins are a diverse family of microtubule-based motor proteins important for intracellular transport and cell division in all eukaryotes  <cit> . genetic and biochemical dissection of kinesin function implicates specific kinesins in the trafficking of organelles  <cit> , signaling complexes  <cit> , and vesicular cargo  <cit> . during mitosis and cytokinesis, kinesins are essential for microtubule dynamics regulation, assembly and maintenance of bipolar spindles, and accurate chromosome segregation  <cit> . assessing the precise contributions of kinesins to highly dynamic processes during both interphase and mitosis is challenging. genetic tools such as sirna are general and specific, but lack temporal resolution and reversibility necessary for detailed analysis of dynamic processes. reversible, small molecule inhibitors of both microtubule- and actin-based motors are proving to be invaluable tools with which to study their functions during cell division  <cit> . monastrol, a specific inhibitor of the bimc class kinesin eg <dig>   <cit> , has permitted more critical analyses of eg <dig> function during spindle assembly  <cit>  and as a reversible agent to synchronize cells in metaphase  <cit> . furthermore, inhibitors of eg <dig> and other mitotic kinesins are plausible anti-cancer drugs now under development and testing  <cit> . they work by disrupting the mitotic spindle, arresting cancer cells in mitosis, and thus triggering apoptosis  <cit> .

bimc class kinesins are widely required for bipolar spindle assembly during mitosis and meiosis. they are homotetrameric, plus-end directed kinesins that associate with the spindle during mitosis  <cit>  and their inhibition or removal generally results in spindle collapse  <cit> . spindles are dynamic, bipolar arrays of microtubules that are maintained in part by a balance of forces between oppositely directed motor proteins  <cit> , and it is likely that eg <dig> provides the forces that drives the two spindle poles apart from each other. monastrol reversibly inhibits microtubule gliding by eg <dig> and causes spindle collapse in cells  <cit> . eg <dig> supports anti-parallel sliding of microtubules in vitro  <cit>  and during poleward flux in xenopus extract spindles, a process completely inhibited by monastrol  <cit> . biochemical analysis of microtubule binding  <cit>  and gliding by eg <dig> in vitro  <cit>  indicates monastrol induces microtubule release and therefore complete loss of eg <dig> function as a microtubule cross-linker and motor.

the co-crystal structure of eg <dig> bound to monastrol reveals the drug binding site in atomic detail. monastrol binds in a hydrophobic, induced-fit pocket between two non-conserved features of kinesin motor domains, loop  <dig> and alpha-helix  <dig>  . upon drug binding, α <dig> moves 1Å relative to alpha-helix  <dig>  and loop  <dig> folds onto the drug binding site  <cit> . specific hydrophobic  and polar  interactions appear in the crystal structure, but it is unclear how they contribute to drug binding. there is direct  <cit>  or biochemical evidence that at least two other structural classes of eg <dig> inhibitors target this site, reducing dynamics of α <dig> and loop  <dig>  <cit> . considering the changes in the structure of this site, it is unclear how these interactions contribute to drug binding, specificity, and inhibition of eg <dig> 

guided by the atomic structure of the eg5-adp-monastrol ternary complex, we used a combination of synthetic chemistry, targeted mutagenesis, and protein biochemistry to characterize the interaction between the eg <dig> motor domain and monastrol at the atomic level. initially, we confirm that the structure is consistent with species-specificity of monastrol in cells. a structure-activity relationship for monastrol and mutation of target binding residues tests the importance of individual amino acid residues and chemical substituents to the protein-drug interaction.

RESULTS
confirmation of crystal structure
we crystallized the monastrol-adp-eg <dig> motor complex, and solved its structure, independent of the published work  <cit>  to  <dig>  Å resolution. our structure confirms the conformational changes in the eg <dig> motor domain induced by monastrol binding in protein crystals obtained using distinct precipitant conditions. the details of crystallization and atomic structure determination are available as supplemental information .

structure-activity relationship of monastrol derivatives in vitro and in cultured cells
we synthesized a variety of monastrol derivatives using the biginelli cyclo-condensation  to determine the small-molecule structure-activity relationship  for inhibition of purified, recombinant eg <dig> motor domain in vitro and monoaster formation in tissue culture cells. overall, sars for in vitro and in vivo activity are tightly correlated, and consistent with the crystal structure of the monastrol binding site. we found that any modification of r <dig> abolishes monastrol activity, supporting its role as a hydrogen bond donor. substituting oxygen for sulfur at position  <dig> also abolishes activity , presumably due to loss of favorable hydrophobic packing interactions with eg <dig>  introducing a bulky isopropyl group at r <dig> abolishes activity by physically clashing with the side chains of a <dig> and e <dig>  by contrast, methylation of position  <dig> and a range of substitutions at position  <dig> do not abolish drug activity . this observation strongly supports a view that the binding mode observed by x-ray crystallography is relevant to biochemical inhibition, and also the view than monopolar spindle assembly in cells is due to eg <dig> inhibition.

monastrol is specific for vertebrate eg <dig> homologs
monastrol binds a hydrophobic pocket between loop  <dig> and α <dig> that is poorly conserved among kinesins, resulting in specificity for vertebrate eg <dig> homologs. the amino acid side chains that contact monastrol are conserved in human eg <dig> and its homologs from x. laevis and d. rerio, but not d. melanogaster klp-61f, a. nidulans bimc or human conventional kinesin . monastrol is known to inhibit human and xenopus eg <dig>  <cit> , but not bimc  <cit> . to test its effect on d. rerio eg <dig> and klp-61f, we treated ab <dig> and kc <dig> cells with monastrol. we observed mitotic arrest in d. rerio, and normal, bipolar spindles in drosophila cells . since klp-61f is required for spindle bipolarity  <cit> , we interpret this result to mean that klp-61f is unaffected by monastrol. to obtain unambiguous evidence, we cloned the motor domain of klp-61f and subjected the recombinant protein to atpase assays in the presence or absence of microtubules. as shown in figure 3b, microtubule-stimulated atp hydrolysis by the klp-61f motor domain is weakly inhibited by monastrol , consistent with the monastrol-insensitivity of kc <dig> cells. thus, species cross-reactivity of monastrol is consistent with the drug binding site observed in the crystal structure. monastrol, or any other drugs that bind at the same site, will probably be inactive in invertebrate cells, and should be used as research tools in such cells only with the greatest of caution. that said, it might be interesting to introduce drug sensitive vertebrate eg <dig> into invertebrate cells for study.

mutational analysis of monastrol binding site
to further test the sequence requirements for monastrol binding and specificity, we introduced mutations into the motor domain of human eg <dig>  the mutations replaced amino acid residues lining the monastrol-binding pocket with the corresponding residues from human conventional kinesin , or were engineered to test if hydrophobic interactions are required for drug binding. steady-state microtubule-stimulated atp hydrolysis by the purified recombinant motor domain provided a convenient measure of eg <dig> activity and inhibition by monastrol  <cit> . the value for kcat is higher than in some publications  <cit> , consistent with different buffer concentration, which we have previously observed have a large effect not only on k <dig> mt  <cit> , but also kcat . we infer that the eg <dig> motor domain is remarkably tolerant of mutations at the monastrol binding site, as all mutant protein constructs displayed nearly wild-type catalytic activity. a few mutations had a marked effect on the enzymatic parameters of eg <dig>  in particular, mutating r <dig> elevated kmatp and l214i, a remarkably conserved mutation, lowered k <dig> mt. a chimera mutation replacing loop  <dig> of eg <dig> with that of conventional kinesin was monastrol-resistant , consistent with a related study  <cit> .

all of the point-mutants, with the exception of y211m, decreased the drug sensitivity of eg <dig>  y211m actually increased the monastrol sensitivity of eg <dig>  perhaps because flexibility of the methionine side chain accommodates a more favorable hydrophobic interaction with the drug. hydrophobic packing between the thiourea and l <dig> appears to be crucial for drug binding, illustrated by the dramatic effect of even a subtle l214i mutation on ic <dig>  l214t mutant was resistant to monastrol, as would be expected, but also to derivative  <dig>  with a compensating hydrophilic urea. hydrophobic contacts from r <dig> are required for monastrol binding, but electrostatic interactions also appear important . in summary, our mutational changes near the binding site are consistent with the eg5-monastrol structure and provide a number of catalytically active mutants of eg <dig> that might be useful to examine spindle assembly and drug resistance in eg <dig> by expression in cells.

discussion
monastrol is a convenient reagent for mitosis research, but its specificity hitherto has not been established. experiments designed to probe the role of eg <dig> in the mitotic spindle and post-mitotic neurons are predicated on the assumption that monastrol is a specific inhibitor of eg <dig>  <cit> . it is reassuring to note that no kinesin protein contains sequences in loop  <dig> and α <dig> that are part of the monastrol binding site. loop  <dig> is highly divergent among different kinesin classes  <cit> , and the sequence of α <dig> near the monastrol binding site is not conserved. indeed, most kinesins project bulky amino acid side chains into the putative monastrol binding pocket that would preclude drug binding . thus, monastrol should be highly selective among kinesins. however, we note it could easily target unexpected proteins. its affinity is fairly low by drug standards, and it is often used on cells at  <dig> μm or more. at such high concentrations, any hydrophobic molecule could bind multiple targets. as a cell biology reagent, monastrol should be replaced with more potent compounds as soon as they are available. one such reagent is s-trityl cysteine, which is inexpensive, more potent than monastrol and appears to target a similar site in eg <dig>  <cit> . in the meantime, pharmacological sar of different eg <dig> inhibitors is a useful approach to implicate a specific role for eg <dig> in biological processes  <cit> .

monastrol binds a cryptic site that would not have been discovered by virtual screening methods previously employed to find novel small-molecule kinesin inhibitors  <cit> . it is also notable that this is a flexible drug binding site, which is also the target for the binding of s-trityl cysteine  <cit>  and  <dig> -diaryl- <dig> -dihydropyrazoles  <cit> , compounds that look very dissimilar in terms of overall shape and charge. while this allosteric site is fortuitous for drug discovery, its evolutionary conservation among vertebrates leads us to speculate that it is required for eg <dig> function in vivo, either as part of the conformational cycle of the motor domain, or more speculatively by binding an unknown endogenous ligand that could be a protein or a small molecule. our preliminary small molecule sar did not yield more potent monastrol derivatives, but highlighted some of the functional groups contributing to eg <dig> inhibition. for instance, the specific hydrogen-bonding interaction between eg <dig> and the phenol group of monastrol as well as hydrophobic packing of the thiophenol appears crucial for drug binding , similar to the interactions observed between dihydropyrazoles and eg <dig>  <cit> . a report published during revision of this manuscript described a sar for monastrol derivatives consistent with our results. however, some inhibitors displaying weak activity in their assays, most notably derivative  <dig>  and 4e, were completely inactive in our hands. the discrepancy can be explained by the higher sensitivity of their assay  <cit> .

although mutations at this site permit microtubule-stimulated atp hydrolysis by the motor domain of eg <dig>  their effect on the kinetic parameters kmatp, k <dig> mt, kcat, and ic <dig> indicate subtle effects on its catalytic cycle. monastrol decreases the microtubule affinity of eg <dig>  and one might expect mutations that lower k <dig> mt to raise ic <dig> for monastrol. this may be true for the l214i, a subtle mutation that would effect transitions between ordered and disordered states of α <dig>  <cit> . a surprising result of our mutational analysis showed that mutating r <dig> greatly elevated kmatp , indicating a weakened affinity for atp. in light of a proposed model whereby monastrol stabilizes a pre-atp hydrolysis conformation of the eg <dig> motor domain  <cit> , this merits further investigation using non-equilibrium enzyme kinetics. the mutant l214t, which introduces a hydrophilic residue into a previously hydrophobic environment, lowers kcat, as well as overall protein expression , as might be expected. systematic mutational analysis around the monastrol binding sight might identify mutants with discrete effects on microtubule and atp binding to help dissect the catalytic cycle of kinesin motor proteins.

the monastrol binding site is a promising target for anti-cancer drug development, but our data showing that relatively subtle mutation confer resistance to drug binding without blocking enzymatic function sound a note of caution; eg <dig> has potential for sporadic mutation to result in clinical resistance. pressure to conserve residues at a substrate binding pocket is one explanation for the selectivity of non-competitive inhibitors among related proteins as compared to substrate-competitive inhibitors  <cit> . the clinical correlate of this biological phenomenon is that non-competitive inhibitors, exemplified by non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors  to treat hiv infection, display fewer non-specific side effects but clinical resistance is easily acquired by mutations in the target protein  <cit> . monastrol is a prototype anti-mitotic agent that displays many of the same benefits and limitations of nnrtis. one obvious concern, if eg <dig> inhibitors developed as anti-mitotic drugs also target this site, is the rapid appearance of resistant clones, especially in the context of dna damaging agents employed clinically. the importance of the monstrol binding site could be explored by gene replacement experiment, swapping drug resistant point mutants for the wild-type protein. previously such experiments have been hard in vertebrate cells, but recent progress with sirna and bacterial artificial chromosome technologies' makes them feasible, even in human cancer cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the published crystal structure of monastrol in a ternary complex with the eg <dig> motor domain and adp  <cit> , as well as our own structural studies arrived independently, are consistent with the structure-activity relationship of monastrol against purified, recombinant eg <dig> motor domain in vitro and in tissue culture cells. consistent with sequence homology at the drug binding site, we demonstrate the monastrol does not target klp-61f, the eg <dig> homolog in d. melanogaster, but arrests d. rerio cells in mitosis. finally, we performed mutational analysis at drug-binding residues which high-lights flexibility at the drug binding site, and suggests a mechanism for genetic resistance to monastrol, and possibly more potent eg <dig> inhibitors currently being developed as anti-mitotic agents in cancer chemotherapy.
