BACKGROUND
the nuclear periphery is a unique subcompartment of the nucleus that consists of the inner nuclear membrane  and its associated proteins, nuclear lamina  and chromatin  <cit> . a number of genes were found to preferentially localize to the nuclear periphery, and re-position upon transcription activation or cellular differentiation  <cit> . nonetheless, how gene positioning to the nuclear periphery confers regulatory functions remains largely unclear. tethering reporter genes to the nuclear periphery led to repression of some, but not all, transgenes as well as several proximal native genes, indicating that roles for the nuclear periphery in transcription are not obligatory but rather occur on a gene-by-gene basis  <cit> . characterizing the features of chromatin at the nuclear periphery will help to better understand the mechanistic links between subnuclear gene positioning and transcription regulation.

interactions of chromatin with the nl have been studied by microscopic approaches  <cit> , and alterations to chromatin at the nuclear periphery are often associated with aging  <cit>  or with the presence of lamin mutants  <cit> . recently, genome-wide mapping has become a powerful approach in identifying chromatin domains associated with the nl. in particular, dna adenine methyltransferase identification  assay has successfully identified large lamina-associated domains  covering about 40% of the genome in human and mouse cells  <cit> . damid assay using inm proteins such as emerin yielded binding profiles that were similar to lamin b <dig>  <cit> , indicating that the identified genomic regions largely represent those regions that are preferentially positioned to the nuclear periphery. in mouse cells, lads are  <dig> kb to  <dig> mb in size and have lower gene densities, lower transcription activities, and lower occupancy of active histone modifications than non-lad regions of the genome  <cit> . the boundaries of lads are enriched with ctcf binding sites, cpg islands, and promoters transcribing away from the lads  <cit> . a recent study has dissected a lad at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus and identified dna sequences that can direct transgenes to the nl in mouse fibroblasts. these sequences are enriched with a gaga motif and associated with transcription corepressor ckrox and histone deacetylase hdac <dig>  <cit> . while lads are generally considered as repressive chromatin domains, it is not clear how these domains play regulatory roles on gene transcription.

cellular imaging and genomic analyses have revealed substantial compartmentalization of the nucleus, and have suggested that this compartmentalization functions in gene regulation  <cit> . gene transcription at the nuclear periphery is also under the influence of the compartmentalization of chromatin domains and regulatory factors  <cit> . for example, our previous work on the mouse myogenic differentiation system has revealed that the non-canonical tfiid subunit, taf <dig>  but not other transcription components such as rna polymerase ii , taf <dig> and tbp, is localized away from the nuclear periphery where the key myogenic gene myod is located  <cit> . this differential localization is correlated with the differential occupancy of taf <dig> versus tfiid at the myod promoter. additionally, we noticed that h3k4me <dig> — the histone modification labeling active promoters — was localized away from the nuclear periphery, and that recognition of h3k4me <dig> appeared to be required for the subnuclear localization of taf <dig>  <cit> . another recent study in the myogenic system revealed that transcription repression by msx <dig> required recruiting polycomb to the nuclear periphery and the enrichment of the repressive histone modification h3k27me <dig> on target genes  <cit> . thus, it would be very interesting to further characterize the features of chromatin at the nuclear periphery by examining localizations of additional histone modifications and their genome-wide distributions relative to dna sequences associated with the nl. the recent development of high throughput dna sequencing  <cit>  may reveal additional features of lamina-associated regions with improved sensitivity and resolution. we anticipate that bridging cellular imaging and molecular mapping approaches will present a unique opportunity to cross-examine the compartmentalization of histone modifications at both subcellular and genome-wide levels.

in this paper, we have generated the initial maps of genome-nl interactions in mouse 3t <dig> fibroblasts and c2c <dig> myoblasts by damid assay coupled to high throughput dna sequencing. we have identified sequencing-based lads  that cover ~30% of the genome and represent the genomic regions with significant nl association. in 3t <dig> fibroblasts, the slads largely overlap with the lads reported previously  <cit> , and range from a few kb to over  <dig> mb in size. these newly constructed high-resolution damid maps allow the examination of nl association within the structure of genes. for example, we have detected substantially lower nl association around the transcription start sites  of expressed slad genes. furthermore, by cell imaging and genome analyses, we have confirmed that several active histone modifications, such as h3k4me <dig>  h3k9ac and h3k36me <dig>  are localized away from the nuclear periphery and are predominantly distributed outside of slads. these findings further support the notion that chromatin at the nuclear periphery is characterized by the paucity of active histone modifications, which may have implications on how peripheral gene positioning affects transcription regulation in mammalian cells.

RESULTS
detecting dna sequences associated with the nl by damid coupled to high throughput dna sequencing
the published genome-nl interaction maps were constructed using damid assay followed by analysis on genome tiling arrays  <cit>  . in this study, we developed the dam-seq method that couples next-generation sequencing  to damid assay. first, we tethered mouse lamin b <dig> to e. coli dna adenine methyltransferase  and expressed the fusion protein in mouse cells. in eukaryotic cells that lack endogenous dam proteins, the tethered dam is capable of methylating adenines in gatc sequences that are in close spatial proximity  <cit> . this fusion protein was successfully used to identify genomic regions associated with the nl in mouse cells  <cit> , and we have confirmed its localization at the nuclear periphery by immunofluorescence staining . next, we infected 3t <dig> mouse embryonic fibroblast  cells and c2c <dig> myoblast cells with the lentivirus expressing dam-lamin b <dig> at a very low level  <cit> , purified the genomic dna from infected cells, specifically amplified the methylated dna fragments and sequenced them directly. the same protocol was applied to cells expressing free dam proteins and the sequencing data served as a control to correct for local dna accessibilities  <cit>  and sequencing biases. we prepared two replicates for each fusion protein  in each cell type and sequenced the dna libraries separately. only sequencing reads that were uniquely mapped to chromosome 1– <dig> and x were retained, and potential pcr duplicates were removed. all pairs of replicates have highly correlated read densities along the genome  and thus were combined for the follow-up analyses. in total, we obtained  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million reads from 3t <dig> mef cells expressing dam-lamin b <dig>  and free dam , respectively, and obtained  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million reads from c2c <dig> myoblast cells expressing dam-lamin b <dig>  and free dam , respectively.

construction of genome-nl interaction maps
the lads identified by dam-chip are large genomic regions ranging from tens of kilo bases to over  <dig> million bases  <cit> . to identify such broad domains based on the ngs reads, we employed the bioinformatic software sicer  <cit> , which has been successfully used to map histone modifications and their binding proteins  <cit> . briefly, sicer divides a genome into non-overlapping, contiguous windows, identifies individual windows or larger domains  in which the experimental sample has significantly higher read counts than the random background , and calculates the statistical significance of the enrichment by taking into account the control sample. as a result, we have identified  <dig>  slads  in 3t <dig> mefs and  <dig>   in c2c <dig> myoblasts, with the size ranging from 2kb to over 1mb . in addition,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the genome in mefs and myoblasts respectively had neither lmnb <dig> nor dam reads, and were termed “undetermined regions” that usually corresponded to genome assembly gaps or highly repetitive dna segments.

we have validated the dam-seq method by the following analyses using the data from 3t <dig> mefs. first, to estimate the depth of sequencing, we identified slads from randomly sampled sequencing reads and plotted the slad genome coverage versus the number of sampled reads . the increment of slad genome coverage was less than 1% of the genome per five million reads when the input lmnb <dig> reads were over  <dig> million, and the genome coverage was close to saturation with ~ <dig> million lmnb <dig> reads . this simulation result suggests that the vast majority of the slads have been identified with the current sequencing depth . to examine whether the slads identified at lower sequencing depths were concordant with those identified at the highest sequencing depth , we plotted percentages of concordant and missed  <dig> kb slad windows at each sampled sequencing depth . over 98% of the  <dig> kb slad windows identified at each lower sequencing depth stay as slads based on the full dataset, while the percentage of missed 2 kb slad windows decreases quickly as the sequencing depth gets higher . therefore, increasing sequencing depth retains the vast majority of the slads and helps to identify slads that are missed at a lower sequencing depth.

second, similar to the dam-chip method that measures nl association by log <dig> fluorescent intensity ratios of lmnb <dig> over dam   <cit> , we computed log <dig> read density  ratios of lmnb <dig> over dam  for all the non-overlapping, contiguous 2 kb windows along the genome. the chromosome-wide profiles of log <dig> seq ratios and log <dig> chip ratios are fairly similar . the log <dig> seq ratios range from − <dig>  to  <dig>   while the log <dig> chip ratios range from − <dig>  to  <dig>  , suggesting that the sequencing method reports a higher dynamic range of nl association.

third, we compared the genomic distributions of slads and the published lads in mefs  <cit> . the vast majority of lads are in common with slads except that  <dig> lads  do not overlap with any slads. in many cases, one lad comprises an array of slads and non-slads , which is consistent with the smaller sizes of slads . our sequencing method also identified slad specific regions that cover 108 mb,  <dig> % of the genome and  <dig> % of the slads. in order to evaluate the differences between slads and lads, we have compared the log <dig> seq ratios among the following four sets of genomic regions: the common regions between slads and lads , the regions specific to lads , the regions specific to slads  and the regions that are neither lads nor slads  . pairwise comparisons using wilcoxon-mann–whitney tests have shown that the median log <dig> seq ratios decrease in the above order . further examination of the lmnb <dig> and dam read densities in these datasets has revealed that the median lmnb <dig> read density in lad-only regions is only slightly higher than that in common non-slads/non-lads and is much lower than those in common slads/lads and slad-only regions . also, the median dam read density in lad-only regions is the lowest among the four datasets . therefore, lad-only regions were excluded by sicer due to low lmnb <dig> read densities. these regions might have fairly high lmnb1/dam ratios, but low lmnb <dig> and dam read densities might introduce false positives. in contrast, slad-only regions were retained by sicer because of high lmnb <dig> read densities and statistically significant lmnb1/dam ratios . to summarize, sicer identifies  <dig> kb windows with high lmnb <dig> read densities, retains regions with statistical significance by comparing with dam read densities, and includes gap regions  that may not have high lmnb1/dam ratios or high lmnb <dig> read densities, in order to account for the potential lack of sequencing depth. the last step partly explains the overlapping data ranges among these four datasets . we note that some lad-only regions may be identified as slads at a higher sequencing depth, but the ability of sicer to recognize the heterogeneity in lmnb1/dam ratios within lads is important to compare nl association at a finer scale.

validation of the subnuclear localizations of slads and slad genes
by dna fluorescence in situ hybridization , we validated the spatial proximities of slads relative to the nl. first, we examined the localizations of several gene-containing regions in slads and non-slads in c2c <dig> myoblasts. we defined slad genes as those with more than 60% slad coverage over the gene body, i.e. from tss to transcription end site  . indeed, all five slad gene loci that we have tested are localized preferentially to the nuclear periphery in c2c <dig> myoblasts , among which 40–60% of the loci are located within  <dig>  μm to the nl . given that the mobility of gene loci is usually constrained to about  <dig>  μm in mammalian cells  <cit> , it is likely that these gene loci are contacting the nl at a significant frequency. in sharp contrast, non-slad genes are located away from the nl , and the fraction of gene loci located within  <dig>  μm to the nl is below 5% . therefore, fish imaging analyses have confirmed the proximities of these slad genes to the nl in c2c <dig> myoblasts.

next, we compared the subnuclear localizations of three slad-only regions and two lad-only regions in 3t <dig> fibroblasts . all three slad-only regions were confirmed to be spatially proximal to the nl , while the two lad-only regions were found to be less proximal to the nl . therefore, at least some of the slad-only regions  are indeed spatially proximal to the nl and some lad-only regions  are less proximal to the nl. in summary, all the above fish analyses have supported the validity of our newly introduced dam-seq method in identifying genomic regions that are positioned close to the nl.

nl association across genic regions in myoblasts
as described earlier, we have computed genome-wide nl association as log <dig> seq ratios of lmnb <dig> over dam for  <dig> kb windows along the genome. this dataset has allowed us to characterize the nl association across genic regions in c2c <dig> myoblasts. the average nl association across slad genes are much higher  than non-slad genes . interestingly, nl association is lower in tss proximal regions compared with the remaining genic regions in both slad genes and non-slad genes . at individual gene level, tss proximal regions of active slad genes are often excluded from slads and fall into non-slad regions . furthermore,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes with expression data  <cit>  can be grouped into four subcategories: expressed and silent slad genes as well as expressed and silent non-slad genes. compared with silent slad genes, expressed slad genes have more significantly decreased nl association in tss proximal regions . we note that tss proximal regions have a higher read count of free dam but not lmnb <dig> than the remaining genic regions and the regions upstream of the genes , which suggests that tss proximal regions are not generally refractory to dna adenine methylation. instead, they may be more accessible to the free dam enzyme. we also note that genomic regions around tess do not appear to have a reduced nl association . taken together, our analysis has revealed that tss proximal regions have decreased nl association, and that the levels of this decrease appear to correlate with gene expression.

differential compartmentalization of histone modifications at the nuclear periphery
high resolution cell imaging experiments have revealed the localization of a core promoter factor taf <dig> and the active histone modification h3k4me <dig>  but not the repressive histone modification h3k9me <dig>  away from the nuclear periphery  <cit> . thus, we were interested in probing whether the differential compartmentalization at the nl also applies to additional histone modifications. using the confocal microscopy imaging method previously described  <cit> , we analyzed the distributions of seven key histone modifications relative to the nl: h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k9me <dig>  h3k9ac, h3k27me <dig>  h3k36me <dig> and h3k79me <dig>  h3k9me <dig> is a mark of inactive chromatin and is enriched at the nl  <cit> ; concomitantly, it is located throughout the nucleoplasm including the nuclear periphery, and the half maximum of its immunostaining intensity is positioned about  <dig>  μm outside of the center of the nl immunostaining signal . similarly, h3k27me <dig>  an indicator of the polycomb-repressed chromatin  <cit> , is also located throughout the nucleoplasm including the nuclear periphery, and the half maximum of its immunostaining intensity is approximately at the center of the nl staining signal . in sharp contrast, four active histone modifications – h3k4me <dig>  h3k9ac, h3k36me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> – are all localized substantially away from the nl, with the half maximum of immunostaining intensities to be about  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm inside of the nl staining signals . the immunostaining pattern of h3k4me <dig> appears to be intermediate between repressive histone modifications and active histone modifications .

next, we evaluated whether the observed differential compartmentalization of active histone modifications at the nuclear periphery is consistent with their genome-wide distributions relative to slads. we performed this analysis using the recently published chip-seq data of a number of histone modifications and pol ii in c2c <dig> myoblasts  <cit> . for all the eight active histone modifications , less than 5% of the chip-seq peaks are within the slads  and the peak densities in non-slads are substantially higher  than those in slads . these findings reveal that active histone modifications are largely distributed outside of slads, which is consistent with their localizations away from the nuclear periphery as observed by cellular imaging . in contrast, the repressive histone modification h3k27me <dig> has nearly 30% of its chip-seq peaks distributed within the slads  and its peak density in slads is similar to that in non-slads ; consistently, h3k27me <dig> is localized throughout the nucleoplasm including the nuclear periphery as observed by cell imaging . furthermore, about 12% of pol ii binding sites   <cit>  are within slads , and the binding site density in non-slads is about four folds of that in slads . because some of the slad genes are actively transcribed, it is expected that a portion of pol ii binding sites are present in slads. consistently, pol ii was localized closer to the nl than active histone modifications as revealed by cellular imaging  <cit> . taken together, we have made highly consistent observations in the differential compartmentalization of active and repressive histone modifications relative to the nuclear periphery at the microscopic level and relative to slads at the molecular level.

distributions of histone modifications among slad and non-slad genes
similar to depicting nl association across genic regions for each of the six gene categories , we have also analyzed the distributions of the above histone modifications and pol ii in the same genomic regions . as reported previously  <cit> , active histone modifications as well as pol ii form peaks around tsss  except for h3k36me <dig>  which has a major proportion of its peaks along the gene body . we have noticed that: 1) both expressed slad genes and expressed non-slads genes have active histone modifications  and pol ii enriched in tss proximal regions . 2) h3k36me <dig> levels in the gene body appear to be lower in expressed slad genes than expressed non-slad genes . 3) h3k27me <dig> levels are slightly higher in silent genes than in expressed ones, and the difference is more evident between silent and expressed non-slad genes .

discussion
in this study, we have combined the damid assay and high throughput dna sequencing to measure genome-nl interactions, and have developed a robust bioinformatic approach that is suitable for identifying genomic regions associated with lamin b <dig> . in mef cells, slads largely overlap with the lads previously identified using the dna microarray approach  <cit> . comparisons of slads and gene expression data in mefs and myoblasts support a negative correlation , consistent with previous reports  <cit> . the method demonstrated here is applicable to identifying nl-associated regions in other mammalian cell types or differentiation systems, as well as to identifying genomic regions specifically associated with individual inm proteins and their mutants.

we have noticed that among slad genes, nl association is decreased in tss proximal regions and that the decrease in nl association appears to correlate with gene expression. highly sensitive, direct measurements of transcription are needed in order to define more precisely the relationship between gene expression and nl association. the reduced nl association in tss proximal regions can be due to their increased spatial separations from the nl, or their increased chromatin accessibilities, and it is likely that both scenarios may contribute to this observed phenomenon. it is also intriguing to speculate that the reduced nl association in tss proximal regions may provide a local environment amenable for recruiting transcription machineries and transcription initiation.

we have performed parallel examinations on the nuclear compartmentalization of several key histone modifications in c2c <dig> myoblasts by cellular imaging and a combined analysis of chip-seq and dam-seq data. histone modifications  that are localized throughout the nucleoplasm including the nuclear periphery are distributed both within and outside of slads with similar densities. in contrast, active histone modifications that are largely located away from the nuclear periphery are also predominantly distributed outside of slads . these highly consistent results indicate that in c2c <dig> myoblasts, chromatin at the nuclear periphery is largely characterized by the paucity of active histone modifications. it remains an open question about chromatin features at the nuclear periphery in other cell types such as stem cells and terminally differentiated cells. for instance, it was observed that the repressive h3k27me <dig> mark is enriched at the nuclear periphery in mouse embryonic stem cells  <cit> . it would also be interesting to determine whether similar spatial compartmentalization also exists for protein factors associated with these histone modifications . the molecular and imaging methods demonstrated here and in the previous report  <cit>  may be used for future investigations.

CONCLUSIONS
by coupling next generation sequencing to the damid assay, we have identified slads that are genomic regions with significant association to the nl, ranging from a few kb to over  <dig> mb and covering about 30% of the mouse genome. single cell imaging and genomic analyses have provided consistent evidence on the paucity of several active histone modifications at the nuclear periphery both at the microscopic and the molecular levels in c2c <dig> myoblasts. comparing slad genes and non-slad genes has revealed distinct histone modification levels and nl association that correlate with gene expression states. our work may give clues on how gene positioning to the nuclear periphery  affects transcription regulation in mammalian cells.
