BACKGROUND
the γ-proteobacteria shewanella species have two hallmark traits, respiratory versatility and psychrophily  <cit> . respiratory versatility is characterized by their ability to utilize a series of organic and inorganic electron acceptors, particularly metals and metalloids of fe, mn, ur and the direct electron transfer to electrodes  <cit> . shewanella species harbor a variety of outer membrane and periplasmic c-type cytochrome genes expressed for respiration under different environmental conditions. bacterial gene expression is regulated by a series of transcriptional factors including alternative sigma factors . sigma factors are a component of bacterial rna polymerase  and determine promoter selectivity of the holoenzyme, thus playing a central role in the regulation of gene expression. bacteria usually have one housekeeping σ factor  and a variable number of alternative σ factors that possess different promoter-recognition properties  <cit> . the number of alternative σ factors highly varies among bacteria and may be related to their specific habitat, metabolisms, and development  <cit> . extracytoplasmic function  σ factors are highly regulated factors that control expression of genes and constitute the third pillar of bacterial signal transduction after the one-component and two-component systems  <cit> . most ecf σs are sequestered by an anti-sigma factor, which can be deactivated by proteolysis, conformational change, partner switching  or other unknown mechanisms to release the ecf sigma factor from being sequestered  <cit> . once the ecf sigma factor is released it can then activate of transcription of regulon genes throughout the genome. ecf sigma factor rpoe and its regulators have been extensively studied in e. coli  <cit> , pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit>  and bacillus subtilis  <cit> . rpoe regulates a series of extracytoplasmic functions, including synthesis of envelope proteins, outer membrane protein  modification, cell envelope structure and cell division in e. coli  <cit> . the rpoe counterpart algu/t controls the production of a series of pathogenic factors, lipoproteins, and the extracellular polysaccharide alginate in p. aeruginosa which causes the mortality and morbidity of patients with cystic fibrosis  <cit> .

the sigma factors of shewanella have remained relatively uncharacterized. the genome of shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig> encodes  <dig> sigma factors , so_ <dig>  and so_ <dig> . sigma <dig>  is the heat shock response sigma factor and it has been shown that heat shock activates expression of  <dig> genes and represses expression of  <dig> genes  <cit> . in s. violacea strain dss <dig>  three rpoe-like sigma factors have been identified  <cit> . numerous transcriptomic studies have shown shewanella can modulate gene expression in response to its environmental signals  <cit> . to shed light on the role of two of the rpoe sigma factors of s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  comparative studies were conducted in this study. deletion mutants were generated and utilized to ascertain the specific functions of each rpoe sigma factor and the two sigma factors dependent genes were identified. rpoe was required for growth at cold and high temperatures, in minimal media, and in high salt environments. unlike rpoe, rpoe <dig> is responsible for resistance to oxidative stress. pgpd was identified as the rpoe <dig> dependent periplasmic glutathione peroxidase that facilitates resistance to oxidative stress. understanding the regulation of rpoe and rpoe <dig> and the genes they control can help explain the ability of s. oneidensis to survive against environmental stress.

RESULTS
rpoe ecf sigma factors and anti-sigma factor genes in s. oneidensis mr-1
the homologues for the e. coli primary σ factor, rpod, and five out of six alternative σ factors rpon, rpos, rpoh, rpoe, and flia , are present in all the sequenced genomes of shewanella . several shewanella strains such as s. baltica os <dig> and s. putrefaciens w3-18- <dig> also contain another flia for lateral flagella  <cit> . however, the fecr -feci -feca  iron-starvation signaling system is absent in most of the sequenced shewanella strains, except for a few s. baltica strains. there are five ecf-like σ factors, encoded by so_ <dig>  so_ <dig> so_ <dig>  so_ <dig>  and so_ <dig>  found in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  so_ <dig> was identified as the orthologue for rpoe  of e. coli and algu/t of p. aeruginosa based on the high sequence similarity and the well-conserved gene cluster of rpoe-rsea-rseb-rsec and flanking genes . so_ <dig>  encodes the orthologue for rpoe of the photosynthetic α-proteobacterium rhodobacter sphaeroides, and the downstream locus so_ <dig> encodes the putative cognate anti-σ factor homologous to chrr  <cit> . we further characterized the cellular functions of rpoe  and rpoe <dig> experimentally and computationally.figure  <dig>

rpoe and rpoe <dig> of s. oneidensis are responsible for diverse stress responses
in order to characterize the roles of each of the rpoe sigma factors, the rpoe and rpoe <dig> genes were deleted from strain mr- <dig>  the rpoe and rpoe <dig> mutant strains had no observable growth defects in rich media . we examined the role of the rpoe sigma factor genes in growth under the stress conditions. the rpoe mutant displayed a severe growth defect when cultured in the minimal medium, but no growth defect was observed for the rpoe <dig> mutant strain . as expected the rpoe mutant had a growth defect at high temperature  however no growth defect was observed for the rpoe <dig> mutant . in addition, the rpoe mutant also showed a growth defect at low temperatures  and high salinity  . though the rpoe mutant showed an apparent growth defect at high salinity, the growth of the rpoe <dig> mutant was even better than that of the wild type strain . the rpoe mutant was susceptible to ampicillin , though the s. oneidensis mr- <dig> wild type strain is resistant to this antibiotic  <cit> .figure  <dig>

rpoe is autoreglated and degq is rpoe-dependent
the multiple aligment and sequence logos analyses of promoter sequences upstream of rpoe/algu in shewanella oneidensis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli were shown the conserved − <dig> and − <dig> motifs gaactt---16/17 bp---tccaaa upstream of rpoe/algu . by using the clustal w multiple alignment and weblogo software <cit> , we also identified two conserved motifs gaactt and tctaca upstream of rpoe in  <dig> shewanella strains, which are similar to the − <dig> and − <dig> consensus sequences of the rpoe-dependent promoter . furthermor, we mapped the transcription start site  of rpoe  by using primer extension . in addition, expression of the pherd30t-rpoe in trans did significantly enhance the transcription of chromosomal rsea locus in the mr- <dig> strain, indicating that the expression of the rpoe-rseabc gene cluster could be up-regulated by rpoe .figure  <dig>

based on the promoter motif recognition and the knowledge on e. coli and p. aeruginosa, part of the rpoe-dependent regulon was predicted in the genome of mr- <dig> . these genes encode the omp assembly complex bamabcde and the lipopolysaccharide  assembly complex components lptabcd and lipid biosynthesis-related proteins lpxa, b, and d. the fkpa, sura, skp and ppia genes are involved in the proper folding of omps  <cit> . the expression of degp/mucd gene, encoding the periplasmic protease do, is rpoe/algu-dependent and is required for survival at high temperatures and envelope integrity in e. coli and pseudomonas because degp/mucd could scavenge abnormal proteins in the periplasm and function as a chaperone for assembly of omps  <cit> . however, the only one degp/htra homolog  was identified as the e. coli degq orthologue other than degp because it lacks the characteristic q-linker  of the latter   <cit> . in addition, this gene  is chromosomally linked with degs  as previously found in e. coli. the deletion of degq also resulted in the susceptibility of s. oneidensis mr- <dig> to ampicillin . the degq gene does not belong to rpoe regulon in e. coli  <cit>  and is absent in pseudomonas. we found that the degq gene was also rpoe-regulated in mr- <dig> because the induced expression of rpoe enhanced the transcription of degq in turn . there is a ta rich region followed by the gaactt motif upstream of the open reading frame of degq  <cit> . the heat shock sigma  <dig> factor gene  is also regulated by rpoe in mr- <dig> . degq might act as a major protease for protein quality control in the periplasm in the absence of degp. deletion of degq resulted in severe growth defectiveness under a higher temperature and the growth of mutant could be rescued by genetic complementation of plasmid borne-degq gene . these results showed that degq played a central role in the high temperature growth of shewanella in the absence of the rpoe-dependent protease do .table  <dig>

phrdegq is required for optimal growth of strain mr- <dig> under high temperature. genetic complementation by plasmid-borne degq rescued bacterial growth of the degq mutant. the mr-1Δdegq strains carrying empty vector  and pherd30t-degq plasmid  and the pherd30t-carrying wild type mr- <dig>  strains were grown in lb broth supplemented with 15 μg/ml of gentamycin. bacterial strains were grown at 35°c.



rpoe <dig> mediates resistance to oxidative stress responses
the rpoe2-chrr operon is present in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  and is absent in e. coli and pseudomonas. the open reading frames  of rpoe <dig>  and chrr  are overlapped and the overlapped sequence  contains the start codon  of chrr and the stop codon  of rpoe <dig>  strongly suggesting that they belong to the same operon and are translationally coupled . the rpoe <dig> mutant was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat than the wild type mr- <dig> strain , indicating that rpoe <dig> is involved in the oxidative stress responses.figure  <dig>

strains. mr- <dig> wild type strain, the rpoe <dig>  pgpd  and cgpd  in-frame deletion mutants and the pgpd-cgpd double mutant strains were grown in the lb broth containing a)  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 4 mm of paraquat or b)  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and 1 mm of hydrogen peroxide and incubated at 28°c for 18 hrs.



identification of the rpoe <dig> regulon of s. oneidensis
multiple alignment analyses on the nucleotide sequences upstream of rpoe2-chrr revealed two well-conserved motifs, tgatcc and cgtatt, similar to the − <dig> and − <dig> elements of rpoe-dependent promoter in r. sphaeroides . furthermore, we mapped the transcription start site of rpoe <dig>  by using primer extension and rt-pcr methods . the transcription of rpoe <dig> started from a  downstream of the predicted − <dig> and − <dig> promoter motifs . the core regulon of rpoe <dig> had been previously predicted based on the promoter consensus sequence in the vibrio-shewanella species  <cit> , including cfa  and phrb . the loci so_ <dig>  and so_ <dig>  obviously belong to the same operon ranging from so_ <dig> to so_ <dig>  by promoter recognition, we were also able to identify other candidates of rpoe <dig> regulon, including so_ <dig> , so_ <dig> , so_ <dig> , so_ <dig> , and so_ <dig>  . these genes probably represent part of the core regulon of rpoe <dig> coping with photoreactive and oxidative stresses . our results also showed that the transcription of rpoe <dig> and chrr was induced by addition of hydrogen peroxide  . we conducted the semi-quantitative rt-pcr analyses on the rpoe2-induced transcription of several genes of these operons/gene clusters . the l-arabinose induced expression of pherd30t-borne rpoe <dig> remarkably increased the transcription of the chromosomal genes chrr, so_ <dig>  so_ <dig>  so_ <dig>  and so_ <dig> in the rpoe <dig> null mutant. these results indicate that the rpoe2–chrr pair is autoregulated and these genes belong to the rpoe <dig> regulon.figure  <dig>

rpoe2–dependent periplasmic hydrogen peroxidase is involved in oxidative stress response
in light of the fact that rpoe <dig> plays a role in resistance to oxidative stress, we looked at the rpoe <dig> regulon for genes that encode proteins that could be responsible. notably, the rpoe <dig> regulon member so_ <dig> encodes a periplasmic gluthathione peroxidase d , which may be required for coping with the oxidative stress in the compartment of periplasm. the pgpd and the downstream hemh paralogue  had not been previously identified as the rpoe-chrr regulon members in the photosynthetic α-bacterium rhodobacter sphaeroides. the phoa-fusion assays  <cit>  demonstrated that pgpd is secreted into the periplasm as previously predicted because the signal peptide of pgpd could mediate the secretion of phoa . we also mapped the transcription start site of the predicted rpoe <dig> regulon member so_ <dig> and it is shown that the transcription of pgpd  does start from the nucleotide a  downstream of the − <dig>  and − <dig>  promoter motifs as it was shown . we have generated the in-frame deletion mutants of pgpd and cgpd and tested the sensitivity of the mutants to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. our results showed that the pgpd deletion mutant  exhibited a significantly higher sensitivity to oxidative stresses than the mr- <dig> strain  while no remarkable difference was observed between the cgpd mutant  and wild-type strain under the tested concentrations . the growth defectiveness of the pgpd deletion mutant in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and paraquat could be rescued by genetic complementation of plasmid borne-pgpd gene . though pgpd obviously plays a more important role than cgpd under our tested conditions, the double mutant  was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide stress than the mr-1Δrpoe <dig> and mr-1Δpgpd single mutants , indicating that the cgpd gene is also involved in oxidative stress responses.

expression and activity assays of cyptoplasmic and periplasmic hydrogen peroxidases
the cytoplasmic glutathione peroxidase cgpd and the periplasmic pgpd  lacking the n-terminal signal peptide  were successfully overproduced in the e. coli bl21/de <dig> strain and were purified by ni-ntp chromatography . both cgpd and pgpd exhibited the hydrogen peroxide degradation activities in the presence of glutathione  and the activity of pgpd was higher than that of cgpd under the conditions described . the glutathione export system genes are also present in the genome of mr- <dig>  and are probably involved in the export of gsh from cytoplasm to periplasm. these results, together with the in vivo assays , strongly indicated that both pgpd and cgpd were functional in shewanella oneidensis and were probably involved in the degradation of hydrogen peroxide in the periplasm and cytoplasm compartments, respectively.figure  <dig> 
glutathione  peroxidase  activity assays of pgpd and cgpd. a) histidine-tagged cgpd and pgpd proteins were purified. b) glutathione was added and the peroxidase activity is defined as the amount of hydrogen peroxide  broken down in one minute  by one mg of purified enzymes  under the assay conditions described.



absence of rpoe2-chrr pair and the regulon members in psychrophilic and/or deep-sea strains
the rpoe2-chrr system and the regulon members of rpoe <dig> may play a crucial part in coping with environmental stresses such as uva radiation and more importantly reactive oxygen species  in shewanella. the ros could be sensed by chrr, which undergoes conformational changes and releases the sequestered rpoe <dig>  the released rpoe <dig> undergoes auto-upregulation by binding to the promoter of rpoe2-chrr operon and then drives the expression of enzymes involved in modification of cell membrane , dna damage repair , degradation of ros  and other stress responses. our comparative genomic analysis revealed that the rpoe2-chrr operon and these identified rpoe <dig> regulon member genes  are coincidently absent in several shewanella strains, including s. pealean atcc  <dig>  <cit> , s. sediminis haw-eb <dig>  <cit> , s. piezotolerans wp <dig>  <cit> , s. halifaxensis haw-eb <dig>  <cit> , s. violacea dss <dig>  <cit> , and s. benthica kt <dig>  <cit> , which are deep-sea and/or psychrophilic strains  <cit> .

discussion
in this study the cellular functions of two rpoe-ecf sigma factors of s. oneidensis were investigated by comparative genomics, molecular genetics and physiological analyses. we have shown that rpoe is required for bacterial response to a series of stresses, including nutrient depletion , high salinity , high and cold temperatures , and oxidative stresses  in the s. oneidensis mr- <dig> strain. on the other hand, rpoe <dig> is only involved in oxidative stress responses.

in e. coli and p. aeruginosa, the rpoe/algu gene is autoregulated because an rpoe/algu-dependent promoter is located upstream of this gene  <cit> . rpoe regulates a series of extracytoplasmic functions, including synthesis of envelope proteins, outer membrane protein  modification, cell envelope structure and cell division in e. coli  <cit> . the rpoe counterpart algu/t controls the production of a series of pathogenic factors, lipoproteins, and the extracellular polysaccharide alginate in p. aeruginosa which causes the mortality and morbidity of patients with cystic fibrosis  <cit> . rpoe is involved in biogenesis of envelope and integrity maintenance as previously demonstrated in mesophilic and psychrophilic bacteria  <cit> . our results are consistent with previous microarray analysis data that the rpoe exhibited altered transcription under several stress conditions . the n-terminal domain of chrr of r. sphaeroides is structurally similar to that of rsea of e. coli and defines a common cupin fold among anti-σ factors  <cit> .

the shewanella strains harbor a large number of c-type cytochrome genes for respiration. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> c-type cytochrome genes are present in s. putrefaciens w3-18- <dig> and s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  respectively  <cit> . these cytochromes and respiratory chains are a potential source of singlet oxygen  <cit> , which may account for the presence of the rpoe2-chrr pair and the periplasmic glutathione peroxidase gene pgpd in most of the sequenced shewanella strains. on the other hand, the rpoe2-chrr pair and the identified regulon members are coincidentally absent in the deep-sea/psychrophilic strains of shewanella. the deep-sea water is characterized by a very low temperature, typically from 0°c to 3°c, a high salinity of about  <dig> %, as well as low radiation. as described above, rpoe <dig> was not required for bacterial growth under high temperature, nutrient deficiency and particularly cold temperature and high salinity encountered in deep-sea environments. more importantly, the deletion of rpoe <dig> even enhanced the bacterial growth under salt stress condition . on the other hand, overexpression of rpoe <dig> affected bacterial growth under salt stress condition . these results indicated a tradeoff between oxidative stress response and salt stress tolerance. the loss of these genes may represent a bacterial adaptation to deep-sea and cold environments of high salinity. it remains intriguing why rpoe2–mediated changes affect the bacterial growth under high salinity. the functions and regulation of other ecf σs remain largely unknown in shewanella  <cit> . the signaling mechanism for the activation and regulon of each σ factor need to be experimentally investigated since their functions could not be completely predicted based on the existing knowledge from the closely related bacteria and comparative genomics analyses as shown by our results.

CONCLUSIONS
two of the ecf sigma factors, rpoe and rpoe <dig>  regulate a series of extracytoplasmic functions in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  it is revealed that the rpoe-dependent degq gene is required for optimal growth under high temperature. the rpoe <dig> and rpoe2-dependent pgpd gene are involved in oxidative stress responses. the glutathione peroxidase pgpd is secreted into the periplasm and plays a more important role in oxidative stress responses than the cytoplasmic homlog cgpd. but rpoe <dig> is not required for bacterial growth at low temperature and it even affected bacterial growth under salt stress, indicating that there is a tradeoff between the salt resistance and rpoe2-mediated oxidative stress responses.
