BACKGROUND
plant growth is influenced by the presence of bacteria and fungi, and their interactions are particularly common in the rhizospheres of plants with high relative densities of microbes 
 <cit> . pro- and eukaryotic microorganisms compete for simple plant-derived substrates and have thus developed antagonistic strategies. bacteria have found niches with respect to the utilization of fungal-derived substrates as well, with their nutritional strategies ranging from hyphal exudate consumption to endosymbiosis and mycophagy 
 <cit> . current applications related to bacterial-fungal interactions include biocontrol of fungal plant diseases 
 <cit>  and controlled stimulation of mycorrhizal infection 
 <cit> . better insight into the co-existence mechanisms of soil bacteria and fungi is crucial in order to improve existing applications and to invent new ones.

abundant in the rhizospheres of plants, the streptomycetes are best known for their capacity to control plant diseases . the fact that many streptomycetes are able to produce antifungal compounds indicates that they may be competitors of fungi. direct inhibition of fungal parasites may lead to plant protection and is often based on antifungal secondary metabolites 
 <cit> . in parallel to antibiotics, the streptomycetes produce a repertoire of other small molecules, including for instance root growth-inducing auxins 
 <cit>  and iron acquisition-facilitating siderophores 
 <cit> .

ectomycorrhiza formation between filamentous fungi and forest tree roots is crucial to satisfying the nutritional needs of forest trees 
 <cit> . the ectomycorrhizas  and the symbiotic fungal mycelia, the mycorrhizosphere, are associated with diverse bacterial communities. until now, studies on the functional significance of em associated bacteria have been rare 
 <cit> . nevertheless, diverse roles have been implicated for these bacteria, including stimulation of em formation, improved nutrient acquisition and participation in plant protection .

an important question to be addressed with em associated bacteria is whether there is a specific selection for particular bacterial strains by mycorrhizas, since this would indicate an established association between the bacteria, the em fungus, and/or the plant root. frey-klett et al. 
 <cit>  observed such interdependency: the community of fluorescent pseudomonads from em with the fungus laccaria bicolor was more antagonistic against plant pathogenic fungi than the bulk soil community. this suggested that mycorrhiza formation does select for antifungal compound-producing pseudomonads from the soil. moreover, these bacteria were not particularly inhibitory to ectomycorrhiza formation with l. bicolor, indicating some form of adaptation of this ectomycorrhizal fungus to the pseudomonas community.

fungus specificity, i.e. selective inhibition or inhibition of one but stimulation of another fungus, is commonly observed in bacterium-fungus co-culture bioassays. garbaye and duponnois 
 <cit> , for instance, observed that bacteria which stimulate growth and mycorrhiza formation by l. bicolor may be inhibitory to hebeloma cylindrosporum.to date, the study on metabolites related to fungus specificity of mycorrhiza associated bacteria has focused on one streptomyces isolate. riedlinger et al. 
 <cit>  observed that streptomyces sp. ach  <dig> stimulated the growth of the mutualist amanita muscaria, while inhibiting the plant parasite heterobasidion annosum <cit> . em formation with a. muscaria was stimulated by streptomyces sp. ach  <dig>  and at the same time norway spruce roots were protected from h. annosum root rot by the same strain 
 <cit> . the sole inhibition of h. annosum was related to its low level of tolerance to an exudate produced by ach  <dig>  an antifungal substance ws-5995 b. this indicates that production of antibiotics by mycorrhiza associated bacteria is of central importance in relation to fungus specificity, controlled stimulation of mycorrhizal infection, and plant protection.

there is evidence that inoculation of roots with non-pathogenic bacteria may render plants disease resistant. this phenomenon was studied in detail in the interaction between arabidopsis thaliana and fluorescent pseudomonads and has been termed “priming” 
 <cit> . streptomycetes have also been implicated in the induction of a priming-like state in plants. the inoculation of arabidopsis seedlings with streptomyces sp. en <dig> led to suppression of fusarium oxysporum wilt disease in roots and erwinia carotovora soft rot in leaves 
 <cit> . upon pathogen challenge, the endophyte-treated plants demonstrated higher levels of defence gene expression compared with the non-streptomyces-treated controls, indicating a priming-like state in the plant. streptomyces sp. gb 4- <dig> acted in a similar manner against heterobasidion root and butt rot in norway spruce seedlings 
 <cit> . while the sole inoculation with the plant pathogen led to the lysis of the roots, an anatomical barrier against the root pathogen was formed in the presence of streptomyces gb 4- <dig>  the needles of norway spruce were also protected from botrytis cinerea gray mold infection, indicating a systemic response.

here, we report an assessment study of fungal, bacterial, and plant responses to mycorrhiza-associated streptomycetes. based on our earlier work with mycorrhizosphere streptomycetes 
 <cit> , we formulated the following hypotheses:  streptomycetes impact fungi and bacteria in a streptomycete strain specific manner,  few strains promote the growth of mycorrhizal fungi, and  induction of plant defence responses is not widespread among streptomycetes.

we restricted our investigations to the genus streptomyces, since it includes well known antagonists of fungi 
 <cit> , as well as isolates which affect plant resistance against microbial pathogens 
 <cit>  and stimulate mycorrhiza formation 
 <cit> . since production of multiple secondary metabolites is commonplace in streptomyces species 
 <cit>  we expected that the mechanisms underlying fungal specificity are related to the specific patterns of secondary metabolite production.

RESULTS
picea abies ectomycorrhizas host a community of streptomycetes
ectomycorrhizas were collected from beneath 10-year-old norway spruce  trees and cleaned from debris under sterile water. white and pale yellow ectomycorrhizal root tips were pooled and the pooled sample was halved in two. genomic dna was extracted from the first half and the fungal internal transcribed spacer  regions were analyzed. two ectomycorrhizal fungal species were identified from the ectomycorrhizas by blastn comparisons with reference sequence data maintained at ncbi and unite sequence databases . these included piloderma sp., which constituted 90%, and cortinarius spilomeus, which constituted 10% of the analyzed sequences . streptomycete cultures were recovered from the second half of the sample. based on morphological appearance of the sporulating actinomycete isolates on isp- <dig> medium,  <dig> isolates could be distinguished. partial 16 s rdna sequencing was used to identify the actinobacterial isolates to the genus level. this placed the isolates in the genus streptomyces. based on blastn searches with 16 s rdna reference data from the ncbi database grouped the sequences in seven groups, with 16 s rdna sequence homology to s. atratus, s. candidus,, s. hebeiensis, s. drozdowiczii, s. microflavus, s. spiroverticillatus, and s. zaomyceticus .

partial 16 s rdna was amplified from pure cultures of bacteria which were isolated from picea abies-piloderma sp. and p. abies-cortinarius spilomeus ectomycorrhizas. bacterial isolate number, closest 16 s rdna homologue of a cultured bacterium, the extent of sequence identity in a region of  <dig> nucleotides to the closest 16 s rdna homologue sequence, and genbank accession of the partial 16 s rdna fragment are indicated.

fungi from the mycorrhizosphere are specific in their responses to the streptomycetes and none of the streptomycete isolates inhibits all fungi
streptomycete-fungus co-culture bioassays were performed to determine the influence of the bacteria on spruce pathogenic fungi  and on ectomycorrhizal fungi . several antagonists of fusarium oxysporum, heterobasidion abietinum and h. annosum were detected . instantly recognizable was the strong suppression of heterobasidion strains by isolates acm <dig> and acm <dig>  associated with significant inhibition of f. oxysporum. in general, the two heterobasidion strains responded somewhat differentially to bacterial treatments. while suppression of h. abietinum was marked with isolates acm <dig> , acm <dig> , and acm <dig> , co-cultures of h. annosum with the same bacteria led to less inhibition . in co-cultures with acm <dig> and acm <dig>  in contrast, mycelial growth of h. abietinum was less inhibited than that of h. annosum. growth of h. abietinum was promoted by acm <dig> while none of the other plant pathogenic fungi showed a positive response to the bacteria.

qualitative differences were observed between the responses of the tested mycorrhizal fungi towards the streptomycetes . laccaria bicolor was promoted by four and inhibited by seven bacteria, amanita muscaria and piloderma croceum were inhibited by nine and three strains, respectively, but not promoted. hebeloma cylindrosporum was, in general, inhibited. the bacterial strains acm <dig>  acm <dig>  acm <dig>  acm <dig>  acm <dig> and acm <dig> inhibited all symbiotic fungi.

strain specific patterns of inhibition in streptomyces-streptomyces interaction bioassays
in order to assess the interactions between streptomycetes and other bacteria in more detail and to approach the chemical diversity of the streptomycetes, five streptomyces strains were selected for further studies according to their differential impact on fungal growth. these were acm <dig>  acm <dig>  acm <dig>  acm <dig> and acm <dig>  first, co-culture bioassays were used to evaluate how the five streptomyces strains affect each other . acm <dig> inhibited all other strains and acm <dig> inhibited all except for acm <dig>  the least inhibitory strain was acm <dig>  which suppressed sporulation of acm <dig> 

to mimic the activity of the compound blends produced by streptomyces strains and to compare the inhibition by polar and non-polar compounds we tested culture supernatants and organic culture extract concentrates against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria . acm <dig> inhibited gram-positive bacteria and other strains suppressed gram-negative bacteria. again, the least inhibitory strain was acm <dig>  which suppressed escherichia coli only. the growth of none of these bacteria was promoted by the streptomycetes. the inhibitory effect of the supernatants of strains acm <dig> and acm <dig> was distinctly stronger than that of the concentrated organic extract, indicating the involvement of polar substances in antagonism of these strains against bacteria.

streptomyces strains produce distinct secondary metabolites
in order to investigate the secondary metabolite profiles of acm <dig>  acm <dig>  acm <dig>  acm <dig> and acm <dig>  bacterial suspension cultures were grown in two culture media. we found distinct mixtures of secondary metabolites . acm <dig> produced the antibiotics cycloheximide, actiphenol and acta  <dig> b <dig> . the siderophore ferulic acid was produced by acm <dig> and acm <dig>  and the siderophore desferrioxamine b by acm <dig>  other identified metabolites included the tryptophan precursor anthranilic acid and macrolactam antibiotic silvalactam, both produced by acm <dig>  most of the metabolites were not identifiable according to the retention time, uv–vis spectrum, and esi-lc-ms analysis. apart from the listed metabolites used for mass spectrometry analyses, the streptomyces strains produced further compounds which resulted in the following numbers of peaks: acm <dig>  five; acm <dig>  nine; acm <dig>  eight; acm <dig>  eleven; acm <dig>  six. 

the metabolite spectra of five selected streptomyces strains were investigated. the bacteria were grown on oat meal  and starch-glucose-glycerol  media. the substances were identified based on their uv–vis spectra and on their molecular mass, determined by esi-lc-ms. the term “confirmed” refers to verification of compound identity by comparison with the purified substance. apart from the listed metabolites the streptomyces strains produced the following numbers of other peaks: acm <dig>  five; acm <dig>  nine; acm <dig>  eight; acm <dig>  eleven; acm <dig>  six.

varying sensitivity of heterobasidion spp. to cycloheximide is reflected in bioassays with the cycloheximide producer streptomyces sp. acm11
the plant pathogenic fungus h. abietinum was more strongly inhibited by acm <dig> than h. annosum in co-culture. the identification of cycloheximide as an acm <dig> produced substance enabled us to assess the tolerance of each fungus to cycloheximide. cycloheximide concentration in the suspension culture medium was estimated as  <dig>  nmol x ml- <dig> . based on this finding, a concentration series of cycloheximide was applied. h. abietinum was inhibited by 10-fold lower concentrations of cycloheximide than h. annosum . this indicates that the stronger inhibition of h. abietinum in co-culture with acm <dig> could be related to cycloheximide production. substance application experiments with the other three identified compounds produced by acm <dig>  acta  <dig> b <dig>  actiphenol and ferulic acid, did not affect the growth of h. abietinum or h. annosum .

inoculation with streptomyces acm <dig> leads to increased photosynthetic yield and decreased brassica black spot symptoms in arabidopsis thaliana
next we tested the influence of streptomycetes on plant vitality and disease resistance. the photosynthetic yield, fv/fm, of a. thaliana seedlings was measured as a vitality marker, representing an estimate of the maximum quantum yield of photosystem ii in the dark adapted state . the brassica black spot disease index of leaves  was used as a disease resistance marker. as we have already reported the influence of the streptomyces gb 4- <dig> on both parameters 
 <cit> , we included it as a positive control. similar to streptomyces gb 4- <dig>  we found an increased fv/fm value and a decreased disease index after the pre-treatment of the roots with acm <dig> . in contrast, treatment with acm <dig> led to decreased fv/fm parameter and increased disease index . the other tested streptomyces strains did not show any impact on either parameter.

discussion
we demonstrated that enrichment isolations of bacteria from piloderma-norway spruce mycorrhizas encompass chemically diverse streptomycetes. chemical characterization of the secondary metabolites produced in streptomyces pure cultures revealed structurally diverse compounds, including antifungal and antibacterial compounds as well as siderophores. our petri plate bioassay experiments against fungi and bacteria indicated that the observed chemical diversity had an impact on inter-phyletic interactions: the streptomyces strains varied in their antibacterial and antifungal activity. the least inhibited fungus in these bioassays was piloderma croceum, closely related to the mycorrhizal fungus piloderma sp., the fungus which dominated in the norway spruce mycorrhizal roots used for isolations. this suggests the potential of such a niche-related community for protecting norway spruce-piloderma mycorrhizas from fungal and bacterial parasites without incurring harm to the host fungus.

the production of secondary metabolites by mycorrhiza associated streptomycetes
after many years of intensive screening of actinomycetes, the frequency of discovering structurally new compounds is apparently decreasing 
 <cit> . since the current strategies for addressing the urgent need for new antibiotics are not efficient enough, another approach might be to examine new niches, or sources, for microbial resources that produce novel compounds 
 <cit> . to search for compounds that affect fungal growth we performed hplc analyses coupled with uv/vis detection and mass spectrometry with five selected mycorrhiza-associated streptomycetes, possessing different activities in streptomyces-fungus bioassays. typically, only a limited number of metabolites are produced in synthetic media 
 <cit> , and to promote production of diverse metabolites two different culture media were employed. the five strains produced diffusible secondary metabolites, of which only seven could be identified using the hplc-uv–vis database containing  <dig> reference compounds 
 <cit> , nist database, and ms analyses. the identified metabolites included antifungal and antimicrobial substances as well as siderophores. the fungal inhibitory strain streptomyces acm <dig> produced the most characterized metabolites, the antibiotics acta 2930 b <dig>  actiphenol, cycloheximide and the siderophore ferulic acid. this indicates that function based screening, e.g. selection of isolates that are highly inhibitory towards fungi for biocontrol applications, may create a bias towards strains producing known compounds. based on spectral measurements and ms analyses, a total of twenty one compounds were produced by the five isolates, suggesting an abundance of yet unreported, putatively bioactive compounds. nevertheless, at least  <dig> secondary metabolites have been discovered from streptomycetes 
 <cit> , and the genome sequences of streptomyces spp. commonly contain 20- <dig> gene clusters for secondary metabolite synthesis, of which approximately 30% may encode biochemical pathways for antibiotics production 
 <cit> . thus, to conclusively determine the novelty of such substances both structural and chemical elucidation as well as the use of comprehensive substance databases is indispensable.

the distinct responses of fungi and bacteria to five selected streptomycete isolates
five acm streptomyces isolates were selected for secondary metabolite analyses to test our hypothesis that variation in secondary metabolite production is mirrored in the variation of the observed dual culture phenotype. thus, general inhibitors of fungi and/or bacteria, selective inhibitors, and a selective fungal growth-promoting strain were chosen. hplc analyses revealed great differences in substance production. for example, strains  <dig> and  <dig> exhibited comparable impacts on fungal growth, yet they differed greatly in the numbers of detected products . the strain producing the most unreported metabolites, acm <dig>  was characterized by a complex streptomyces-fungus interaction spectrum. acm <dig> had a negative impact on a. muscaria, h. cylindrosporum and l. bicolor but did not inhibit plant pathogenic fungi. streptomycetes and other tested gram-positive bacteria were inhibited by acm <dig>  while gram-negative bacteria were only slightly influenced. this suggests that in search for streptomyces strains producing putatively novel compounds, a preliminary screen should not only target fungi and gram-negative bacteria, but also the streptomycetes.

heterobasidion infects roots in particular by growing over root to root contacts 
 <cit> , and the roots of their host trees are predominatly mycorrhizal 
 <cit> . cycloheximide producing streptomycetes on the mycorrhizal roots could thus potentially affect root rot development. we observed that the addition of 1 nmol cycloheximide to the culture medium mimicked the impact of cycloheximide producer acm <dig> to heterobasidion species. neither of the other compounds produced by acm <dig>  affected the growth of h. abietinum or h. annosum, indicating that cycloheximide is responsible for the observed growth inhibition by acm <dig>  the role of cycloheximide in the inhibition of heterobasidion species is supported by our study with another cycloheximide producing streptomycete, streptomyces sp. a <dig> from south brazilian soil. whereas h. abietinum is killed by a <dig>  h. annosum still retains 30% of its growth rate. interestingly, a <dig> not only produces cycloheximide, but also actiphenol, a combination also observed in acm <dig> . h. abietinum and h. annosum have been reported to be physiologically and taxonomically distinct species 
 <cit> . the data of lehr et al. 
 <cit>  indicate that the two species also respond differently to cycloheximide: the levels of gene expression by h. abietinum and h. annosum are highly distinct upon cycloheximide application. long-term screening of streptomycetes shows that approximately 10% of streptomyces isolated from soil produce cycloheximide . it would thus be expected that most fungi have developed resistance or at least tolerance against the antibiotic, since they supposedly regularly encounter cycloheximide producers in the rhizosphere. p. croceum and h. cylindrosporum were not inhibited by the cycloheximide producer acm <dig>  and we recently obtained yeasts during selective isolation of streptomycetes from mushrooms on cycloheximide containing culture media 
 <cit> , which supports the role of cycloheximide in bacterium-fungus interactions. in addition to a specific activity of a single compound, synergistic effects of complex mixtures of substances exuded by a streptomyces bacterium are likely to occur . for instance, s. clavuligerus produces beta-lactamase inhibitors, beta-lactams and cephalosporin analoges that inhibit beta-lactam resistant bacteria only in combination 
 <cit> .

the streptomyces community includes fungal growth inhibiting and -promoting members
elo et al. 
 <cit>  observed that one-third of the streptomyces bacteria from the humus layer of norway spruce stands possessed antifungal properties on plant pathogenic fungi, and none of the strains promoted the growth of the pathogenic fungi. we obtained similar results with mycorrhiza associated streptomyces bacteria. as stated in our first hypothesis, the impacts of mycorrhiza-derived streptomycetes on fungi and bacteria were streptomyces strain-specific. none of the fifteen acm isolates inhibited all fungi; four of the strains inhibited some fungi and stimulated the mycorrhizal fungus laccaria bicolor. dramatic effects were seen only in connection with the plant pathogenic genus heterobasidion, as acm <dig> and acm <dig> completely blocked the growth of h. abietinum.

the occurrence of beneficial interactions between the streptomycetes and the mycorrhizal fungus laccaria bicolor indicate that the presence of potentially interesting positive streptomyces-fungus interactions should not be neglected. richter et al. 
 <cit>  used red pine roots for actinomycete isolations, and they observed similar in vitro effects on ectomycorrhizal fungi as we did in our analysis. most actinomycete isolates exerted effects on fungal growth, inhibiting some while stimulating other fungi. our previous analyses indicate that streptomycetes may produce small molecules that act as fungal growth stimulators. auxofuran, the compound released by the “mycorrhization helper bacterium” streptomyces ach  <dig>  promotes the growth of fly agaric 
 <cit> . such growth-promoting streptomyces substances deserve further attention, as does the analyses of the influence of such substances on fungal metabolism and mycorrhiza formation. in nature, an important factor relating to the production of such small molecules is organismic interactions. for instance, higher levels of auxofuran are produced by ach  <dig> in dual culture with the fungus amanita muscaria, while the production of the antibiotics ws- <dig> b and ws-5995 c, potent inhibitors of fungi, is attenuated 
 <cit> . we observed that the in vivo interactions between mushroom-associated yeasts are distinctly different in dual and tripartite cultures 
 <cit> , suggesting that increasing complexity of communities complicates the prediction of the outcomes of interactions and production levels of bioactive substances. thus, even though several reports indicate a correlation between in vitro growth stimulation and mycorrhiza formation 
 <cit>  and in vitro growth inhibition and biocontrol 
 <cit> , the value of tripartite culture systems including the host plant, and a natural substrate, is clear 
 <cit> .

plant disease resistance is stimulated by a single streptomyces strain only
only a single streptomyces strain isolated from the mycorrhizas, acm <dig>  stimulated plant photosynthetic yield and plant disease resistance against alternaria black spot. non-pathogenic rhizobacteria, including streptomycetes , have been shown to induce resistance in plants both locally and in distal tissues 
 <cit> . however, in comparison to streptomyces gb 4- <dig>  the norway spruce mycorrhizosphere isolate with positive influence on not only the plants’ disease resistance but also on its photosynthetic yield 
 <cit> , the response of arabidopsis thaliana to acm <dig> was moderate. plant growth promotion and enhancement of photosynthetic capacity is not a general feature among mycorrhiza-associated streptomycetes. this assumption is supported by the fact that the tested acm strains, in general, did not affect plant growth. even the cycloheximide producer acm <dig> had only a subtle negative effect on a. thaliana, expressed as lower photosynthetic yield and increased black spot disease index.

CONCLUSIONS
streptomyces community from mycorrhizal roots may impact the growth of spruce-associated micro-organisms in a strain specific manner. differential growth-inhibition was related to the metabolite patterns of each strain, indicating that we have found a novel and a potentially interesting niche for small molecule discovery. we suggest that the combination of antifungals produced by the streptomyces strains from piloderma mycorrhizas provides a broad spectrum of antifungal activity that protects the mycorrhizal roots from fungal parasites, and selects against mycorrhizal fungal competitors.
