BACKGROUND
skin and tissue infections caused by mycobacterium spp. constitute a significant animal health problem for veterinarians involved in the care of livestock and companion animals. of particular concern are the species in the mycobacterium avium complex . while the taxonomy of the mac has undergone some revision over the past decade, currently it is considered to comprise m. avium subsp. avium, m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis, m. avium subsp. hominissuis, m. avium subsp. silvaticum, m. intracellulare, m. chimaera, m. colombiense, m. arosiense, and m. vulneris  <cit> . recently ben salah et al  <cit>  designated three new species isolated from clinical cases in southern france, mycobacterium marseillense, mycobacterium timonense, and mycobacterium bouchedurhonense, as members of the mac.

while 16s rrna sequencing has some utility for identifying species of mycobacterium, some subspecies/species within the mac share identical 16s rrna sequences and thus cannot be differentiated using this locus  <cit> . accordingly, a variety of alternate targets have been investigated for use in differentiating mac species. one of the better characterized targets for bacteria, including mycobacterium, is the rna polymerase β- subunit  gene  <cit> . initial efforts in using the rpob gene as a target for pcr and sequencing-based differentiation among mycobacterium spp. were reported by kim et al.  <cit> . further studies describing the use of this locus by adekambi et al.  <cit>  and adekambi and drancourt  <cit>  established the presence of multiple nucleotide polymorphisms in the full-length rpob gene sequence among mycobacteria.

ben salah et al.  <cit>  identified a 711-bp region of the rpob gene harboring the greatest number of such polymorphisms, and used sequences from this region to investigate a panel of  <dig> clinical isolates provisionally assigned as mac. these authors reported successfully assigning  <dig> of the isolates to a species/subspecies classification. simmon et al.  <cit>  used simultaneous sequencing of rpob and 16s rrna loci to identify clinical isolates of mycobacterium; of  <dig> isolates,  <dig>  were identified to the species level. more recently, whang et al.  <cit>  used a combination of rpob pcr, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism, to identify members of the mac among  <dig> isolates, including  <dig> samples of ruminant origin.

the majority of published studies on the use of rpob sequencing to identify mycobacteria have been conducted on panels of clinical  isolates, and limited collections of animal isolates. accordingly, we were interested in evaluating the protocol of ben salah et al.  <cit>  for the identification of a large number of isolates originating from a variety of animal species. we were particularly interested in the ability of the rpob sequence to differentiate between m. avium subsp. avium, m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis, and m. avium subsp. hominissuis, as these are prominent pathogens of veterinary importance. here, we report the results of our investigation into the use of rpob sequencing to characterize  <dig> isolates generated from submissions to the national veterinary services laboratories  from companion animals, livestock, feral animals, and zoo animals.

RESULTS
rpob gene identification of veterinary isolates
a total of  <dig> isolates, collected over  <dig> - june  <dig> from  <dig> animals  underwent pcr and sequencing of a ~  <dig> bp portion of the rpob gene;  <dig> isolates  were identified to the species level based on similarity at ≥ 98% with a reference sequence. the remaining  <dig> isolates  displayed < 98% similarity with reference sequences and were assigned to a clade based on their location in a neighbor-joining tree containing reference sequences. the two most frequently encountered clades within the mac included the clade containing m. avium subsp. avium, m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis, m. avium subsp. silvaticum, and m. avium subsp. hominissuis; and the clade containing m. intracellulare, m. chimaera, and m. indicus pranii.

for a subset of  <dig> isolates that received both 16s rrna and rpob sequencing,  <dig>  displayed a similar species/clade assignation for both sequencing methods. for the remaining  <dig> isolates, species/clade identities were different with each sequencing method .

rpob gene sequence of m. avium subsp. silvaticum atcc 49884
we observed that two separate lots of the m. avium subsp. silvaticum type strain atcc  <dig>  one lot purchased from that company prior to  <dig>  and the other in spring  <dig>  yielded rpob sequence with nucleotide  <dig>   <dig>  as a cytosine, rather than the thymine present in the existing genbank deposition for m. avium subsp. silvaticum atcc  <dig> . the electropherograms for this portion of the rpob sequence displayed satisfactory peak height , indicating that the cytosine call was not an artifact of sequencing chemistry. subsequently, ion torrent - based genomic sequencing of the atcc  <dig> strain by another laboratory also displayed a cytosine residue rather than a thymine residue . we have deposited our rpob sequence of m. avium subsp. silvaticum atcc  <dig> in genbank .

use of rpob sequencing to identify mycobacterium spp. in selected cohorts of animals
in order to facilitate understanding of the mycobacterial diversity in given host groups, we have chosen to present phylogenetic data documenting the use of the rpob sequence to assist with the characterization of mycobacterium spp. in representative cohorts of animals. note that, to keep our phylogenetic trees to a manageable size, all  <dig> isolates are not presented in the trees; rather, we focused on incorporating those isolates that best represented the breadth of taxa recovered from the animal groups under study.

for reptile/amphibian isolates, one from a snake  displayed 99% similarity with m. conceptionense; a fire belly toad isolate  displayed 99% similarity with the m. immunogenum cluster, while a blue dart frog isolate  displayed 99% similarity to the rpob sequence from m. ulcerans and m. marinum.

space considerations precluded us from including a figure or table devoted to isolates from elephant tissues and trunk washes, however, we noted that rpob sequencing of  <dig> such isolates identified members of the mac, m. septicum, m. holsaticum, and m. arosiense as closest matches to recovered strains of mycobacterium.

characterization of novel isolates in the m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis clade
over the course of the project we identified  <dig> isolates which clustered in the clade containing m. avium subsp. avium, m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis, m. avium subsp. silvaticum and m. avium subsp. hominissuis, while not displaying 100% identity with the rpob sequence for any of these taxa . the host animals included cattle, a deer, an elk, pigs, and a cat, and were cultured from submissions made during  <dig> -  <dig>  all evidenced ≥  <dig> % similarity with the abovementioned members of this mac 'sub-clade' ; all possessed nucleotide substitutions in the third position of the codon, and all possessed satisfactory peaks for their electropherograms, suggesting that the substitutions were not sequencing artifacts.

m.a.a: m. avium subsp. avium; m.a.p.: m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis; m.a.s.: m. avium subsp. silvaticum; m.a.h.: m. avium subsp. hominissuis. note that the sequence for m. avium subsp. silvaticum used in this analysis is genbank accession ef521905

these novel mac isolates were queried via pcr for the insertion elements is <dig> , is <dig> , is <dig> , and dt <dig>   <cit> . results of these pcr assays are provided in table  <dig>  all isolates were is <dig> negative and dt <dig> negative, and all but one isolate  were positive for both is <dig> pcr assays.

interestingly, this isolate, no. 10- <dig>  was positive for the is <dig> element. blast analysis of  <dig> nucleotides sequenced from this pcr product showed 99% similarity with , the m. avium subsp. hominissuis ismav <dig> gene, and 96% similarity with  and , the m. avium subsp. avium insertion elements  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. although this same isolate was negative for both is <dig> pcr assays, it should be noted that the absence of this element has been documented in some isolates of m. avium subsp. avium  <cit> .

discussion
in our hands, the rpob pcr assay readily generated amplicons from > 99% of isolates tested, and produced quality sequences for > 95% of those isolates.

when both 16s rrna and rpob sequencing were performed on a subset of  <dig> isolates, the percentage of identities matching at the species or clade level with both methods was 70%, a figure lower than that  reported by simmon et al.  <cit>  in their combined sequencing analysis of clinical isolates. the greater degree of discrepancy in our panel may be attributed to the dearth of longer-length  rpob sequences in genbank for type specimens of m. bohemicum, m. asiaticum, m. obuense, etc. as well, we obtain 16s rrna identities for our mycobacterium isolates using the ridom database, which compares ≤  <dig> bp of sequence; use of this smaller segment of the 16s rrna gene may contribute to discrepant results between the assignations with 16s rrna and rpob. we have noticed that when we use genbank to identify species, using the longer-length reads  obtained with our 16s rrna sequences, the resulting species identity is sometimes more likely than the ridom assignation to match the species identity obtained with the rpob sequence. however, the ridom database is curated, unlike genbank, and thus results obtained with the former database are preferable from the standpoint of adhering to the iso <dig> standards governing the operation of our laboratory.

additionally, some of the isolates for which rpob similarities were < 98% with reference sequences may  represent new species. we note that anecdotally, the descriptions of new species of veterinary origin have tended to lag behind those of human origin, which may contribute to the ambiguity surrounding assignations of identities to some of the isolates in our panel. as we expand the use of rpob sequencing in our laboratory, we intend to continue adding sequences of ≥  <dig> bp from  species and veterinary isolates to genbank, as this will improve the ability of this locus, and assays derived from it, such as the ripseq assay  <cit> , to identify mycobacterial species.

a weakness of the combined use of 16s rrna and rpob sequences for species assignation is that some clades of mycobacterium may not be partitioned to species level via the combined use of these two loci. for example, zelazny et al.  <cit>  examined  <dig> clinical isolates belonging to the m. abscessus group and observed that rpob sequencing parsed this collection into  <dig> m. abscessus isolates,  <dig> m. massiliense isolates, and  <dig> m. bolletii isolates. the inclusion of additional sequence data from the seca and hsp <dig> genes resulted in the assignation of  <dig> m. abscessus isolates,  <dig> m. massiliense isolates, and  <dig> m. bolletii isolates; the remaining  <dig> isolates ultimately were assigned to m. massiliense via use of its sequencing. while the use of multilocus sequence typing  incorporating loci such as hsp <dig> and seca undoubtedly would aid in the more accurate identification of isolates, the current economics of veterinary diagnostic testing rule against routine use of mlst in our laboratory.

our evaluation of rpob sequencing indicated that it will be of particular value in assigning species designations to members of the mac. of the  <dig> isolates for which rpob sequence was obtained,  <dig>  were members of the mac, and the most frequently isolated species was m. hominissuis . similar to the results of ben salah et al.  <cit> , who observed that m. avium subsp. hominissuis constituted the major mac member in their panel of  <dig> clinical isolates, this subspecies was the predominant mac isolated from all animals in our study. the cosmopolitan distribution of m. avium subsp. hominissuis observed among our panel of host animals suggests that this subspecies may be responsible for a substantial proportion of mycobacterial disease among livestock, companion animals, and zoo/exotic animals.

for feral swine isolates, non-mac species dominated the assemblage, including novel environmental species such as mycobacterium sp. jls/kms, suggesting that these animals are exposed to a variety of mycobacterial taxa in the course of foraging for food in the forest litter and pasture land. also noteworthy is the observation that  <dig> feral pig isolates displayed < 97% similarity with existing genbank accessions, suggesting that some of these isolates may represent new species. the implications for transmission of these mycobacteria to cattle or domestic pigs, with whom feral pigs often come into contact, are unclear, but in light of the fact that feral swine may harbor important veterinary pathogens , further investigation may be warranted  <cit> .

m. marseillense, m. timonense, and m. bouchedurhonense are recently described members of the mac; all three species were originally recovered from patients in southern france. in their survey of  <dig> clinical isolates of u.s. origin, simmon et al.  <cit>  observed two isolates with rpob sequence similarity to that of m. timonense and m. bouchedurhonense. we observed two elephant and one feral pig  isolates with  <dig> - 97% similarity to the rpob sequence for m. bouchedurhonense. isolates from an elephant , a wallaby , and a domestic cat  displayed  <dig> - 100% similarity to m. marseillense. while the precise location at which the infection was acquired by the host animal obviously cannot be determined with certainty, these findings do expand the categories of host animal and geographic locales for these species.

for other members of the mac, a number of cattle, pig, and cervid isolates segregated into the clade containing m. chimaera and m. intracellulare. however, we did not observe any isolates with rpob sequences with > 98% similarity with m. colombiense. regarding m. avium subsp. silvaticum, the latter species has not been encountered in diagnostic submissions to the nvsl, suggesting that it does not represent a significant source of morbidity or mortality in some groups of animals and birds. however, we have no record of receiving wood pigeons over the past decade, during which we received  <dig> -  <dig> avian specimens each year. our analysis of m. avium subsp. silvaticum indicates that, at least for the atcc  <dig> strain, differentiating it from m. avium subsp. avium may not be possible based on the rpob sequence amplified with the myco-f and myco-r primer set.

m. avium subsp. silvaticum reportedly has a variable biochemical requirement for mycobactin j, consequently nvsl uses a media protocol involving formulations with and without mycobactin j for all avian submissions, so dependency on this reagent would be recognized. accordingly, despite the identical rpob sequence for m. avium subsp. silvaticum and m. avium subsp. avium, we have some degree of confidence in our ability to recognize m. avium subsp. silvaticum in our laboratory. we anticipate that the phylogenetic and taxonomic status of m. avium subsp. silvaticum atcc  <dig>  as a member of the mac, will be clarified by ongoing genomic sequencing efforts .

we identified  <dig> isolates from cattle, cervids, pigs, and a cat that clustered with the clade containing m. avium subsp. avium, m. avium subsp. silvaticum, m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis, and m. avium subsp. hominissuis; however, these isolates did not display 100% similarity with any of these subspecies.

the implications of this observation for diagnostic purposes are unclear. m. avium subsp. avium and m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis are important livestock and companion animal pathogens that are tested for on a routine basis by veterinary diagnostic laboratories, using commercial real-time and conventional pcr assays designed to target insertion elements considered to be unique to the individual subspecies  <cit> . our evaluation of the insertion element profiles  for these novel mac isolates indicates that they display some heterogeneity in this regard, making assignation to a defined subspecies problematic. we are pursuing more detailed genetic analyses of these isolates  in order to better characterize their taxonomic position within the mac.

currently, standard operating procedures in our laboratory for identification of rapid- and slow- growing mycobacterium involve selected gen-probe® assays, in conjunction with traditional biochemical tests and 16s rrna sequencing. given that 16s rrna sequences are identical among m. avium subsp. avium, m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis, m. avium subsp. silvaticum, and m. avium subsp. hominissuis , resolution to the subspecies level has not been feasible, and thus cases associated with these agents historically have been reported to clients as 'm. avium complex'. our study demonstrates the utility of rpob pcr and sequencing for identification of subspecies within the mac, and other species of mycobacteria, derived from veterinary specimens.

CONCLUSIONS
our panel of  <dig> veterinary isolates represents the most comprehensive such collection yet used to evaluate rpob sequencing as a method of identification to species and/or clade level. our study confirms observations made from studies performed on human isolates, namely, that rpob sequencing can aid in the identification of mycobacterium spp. to the clade or species level. this is particularly true for species belonging to the mac, which continues to represent a major lineage associated with infections in a variety of livestock and companion animals. we note the some mycobacterial assemblages, as the m. abscessus group, require additional loci/mlst for adequate resolution, as a combination of 16s rrna and rpob sequencing alone is inadequate to assign a species identity. accordingly, the use of 16s rrna and rpob sequencing necessarily presents with some limitations. however, in the current context of veterinary diagnostics, the use of 16s rrna and rpob sequencing represents an affordable and cost-effective paradigm for species identification, particularly when compared to methods such as culture- and biochemical- based assays.
