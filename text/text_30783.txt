BACKGROUND
messenger rna polyadenylation is mediated by a multifactor complex in eukaryotes. in mammals, this complex consists of the cleavage stimulatory factor , the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor , two cleavage factors  and poly polymerase  <cit> . cpsf binds to the aauaaa sequence via its  <dig> kd subunit  <cit> , and cstf recognizes the downstream element via its  <dig> kd subunit  <cit> . poly tail formation is further controlled by a nuclear poly -binding protein  <cit> . the polyadenylation of pre-mrnas occurs in the nucleus, and is coupled to the transcription process at many different steps.

among the more interesting of the subunits of the polyadenylation complex is the  <dig> kd subunit of cpsf . cpsf <dig> proteins possess tandem arrays of 3– <dig> ccch zinc finger motifs  <cit>  that are involved in a number of functions of the proteins. cpsf <dig> from drosophila melanogaster  <cit> , mammals  <cit> , yeast  <cit> , and arabidopsis  <cit>  bind rna. moreover, the arabidopsis and drosophila cpsf <dig> proteins possess endoribonucleolytic activity  <cit> . the arabidopsis cpsf <dig>  has been implicated in the responses of plants to oxidative stress  <cit> , and is subject to controls in vitro that further suggest regulation by cellular redox status and heavy metal exposure  <cit> .

atcpsf <dig> lies at the center of a network of protein-protein interactions involving other polyadenylation factor subunits  <cit> . among these interactions are those with two other cpsf subunits – atcpsf <dig> and atcpsf <dig>  beyond the documentation using the two-hybrid assay  <cit> , the significance of these interactions has not been studied. in this report we extend these previous observations with studies of the subcellular location of tagged forms of atcpsf <dig> in plant cells, using a transient expression assay that utilizes over-expression of tagged forms of putative interacting proteins. our results reveal that, in the absence of other cpsf subunits, over-expressed atcpsf <dig> is situated in the cytoplasm. in cells that co-express atcpsf <dig> with either atcpsf <dig> or atcpsf <dig>  atcpsf <dig> can be found in the nucleus, suggesting that association with other cpsf subunits is responsible for the nuclear localization of atcpsf <dig>  co-expression of atcpsf <dig> with atcpsf <dig> results in a re-localization of the latter two proteins to the cytoplasm. as atcpsf <dig> by itself is nucleus-localized, this observation indicates that the interaction between atcpsf <dig> and atcpsf <dig> alters the distribution of atcpsf <dig>  finally, we show that the interactions of atcpsf <dig> with other cpsf subunits involve plant-specific domains of atcpsf <dig>  this suggests that the organization of the plant cpsf complex is different from the analogous complexes in other eukaryotes. these results permit a substantial revision of models of the cpsf complex in plants.

RESULTS
atcpsf <dig> does not appear to possess an inherent nuclear localization signal
to study the subcellular distribution of the arabidopsis cpsf <dig>  the atcpsf <dig> coding region was fused to the c-termini of the dsred <dig> or gfp genes . control constructs encoded unmodified dsred <dig>  <cit> , as well as fusion proteins containing the product of the arabidopsis nda <dig> gene , a synthetic endoplasmic reticulum localization sequence  <cit> , and a zinc finger protein  known to localize to the nucleus  <cit> . in all of these constructs, expression was under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter; the choice of overexpression using the 35s promoter was based on prior observations indicating that the levels of atcpsf <dig> in wild-type plants are exceedingly low  <cit> , and thus detection of the products of transgenes driven by the promoter from the atcpsf <dig> gene  was not feasible. overexpression in transient assays has been used by others to study protein localization and protein-protein interactions, and often reveals unexpected aspects of the functioning of protein complexes  <cit> . it was thus expected that this approach would provide information about the inherent subcellular location signals carried by atcpsf <dig>  accordingly, various combinations of these plasmids were introduced into tobacco leaf cells using a biolistics apparatus and the protein expression and localization assessed using confocal microscopy.

in cells co-transfected with dsred2-atcpsf <dig> and gfp-atzfp <dig>  no accumulation of dsred2-atcpsf <dig> could be seen in the nucleus, . instead, a distribution of dsred2-atcpsf <dig> outside of the nucleus, in distinct foci, was apparent. a similar pattern was not seen in cells that express unmodified dsred <dig> . these foci did not correspond to chloroplasts . moreover, they did not co-localize with the gfp-nda <dig> marker , indicating that they were not mitochondrially-localized. these extranuclear foci were noticeably mobile , and were coincident with the endoplasmic reticulum . however, some locales of the er marker  were devoid of dsred2-atcpsf <dig>  invariably, while dsred2-atcpsf <dig> could not be seen in the nucleus to any appreciable extent, one or more of the cytoplasmic dsred2-atcpsf30-containing foci abutted the nucleus .

as an important cytoplasmic location for rna metabolism is the so-called processing body, or p-body  <cit> , the co-localization of atcpsf <dig> with an arabidopsis p-body marker was studied. for this, dsr was fused to the arabidopsis dcp <dig> protein-coding region and gfp was fused to atcpsf <dig>  dcp <dig> is a component of the arabidopsis p-body  <cit>  and serves in this study as a marker for this structure. in cells co-expressing the dsred2-atdcp <dig> and gfp-atcpsf <dig> fusion proteins, the dsred2-atdcp <dig> was found in distinctive foci , much as has been observed by others  <cit> . these foci were distinct from mitochondria and chloroplasts  in these cells. the dsred2-atdcp <dig> foci were coincident with the gfp-atcpsf <dig> foci . this indicates that, in cells overexpressing the two proteins, gfp-atcpsf <dig> and dsred2-atdcp <dig> are present in the same structures.

the interaction between atcpsf <dig> and atcpsf <dig> promotes nuclear localization of atcpsf30
because messenger rna 3' end formation is a nucleus-localized rna processing event, the absence of dsred2-atcpsf <dig> from the nucleus was surprising. one possible explanation for this observation is that atcpsf <dig> by itself possesses no nuclear localization information, but rather is recruited to the nucleus via interactions with other cpsf subunits. in this case, in cells transiently expressing dsred2-atcpsf <dig> from the 35s promoter, the protein might be present in a vast excess over other interacting partners and would thus localize to a "default" location in the cell. to explore this possibility, the dsred2-atcpsf <dig> fusion protein was co-expressed with gfp fusion proteins containing atcpsf <dig>  atcpsf <dig>  atcpsf <dig>  and atcpsf <dig>  respectively. atcpsf <dig> and atcpsf <dig> were chosen because they have been reported to interact with atcpsf <dig>  <cit> . atcpsf <dig> and atcpsf <dig> are two relatives of the  <dig> kd subunit of cpsf in mammals and the yeast homolog ysh <dig>  while atcpsf <dig> and atcpsf <dig> apparently do not interact with atcpsf <dig> in two-hybrid assays  <cit> , they are part of the arabidopsis cpsf complex and localize to the nucleus  <cit> .

in plant cells that co-express the gfp-atcpsf <dig> and dsred2-atzfp <dig> fusion proteins, both proteins accumulated in the nucleus . this confirms the expected location of atcpsf <dig> in plant cells, and indicates that atcpsf <dig> possesses nuclear localization signals. invariably, when gfp-atcpsf <dig> was co-expressed with dsred2-atcpsf <dig>  the latter accumulated exclusively in the nucleus . however, the distribution of these proteins within the nucleus was often different from that seen for gfp-atcpsf <dig> by itself. in some cases , the distribution of the two proteins in the nucleus was similar to the nuclear marker . however, the more frequent result was that gfp-atcpsf <dig> and dsred2-atcpsf <dig> co-localized to distinctive structures within the nucleus ; these structures also contained dna, as they could be stained with hoechst stain .

atcpsf <dig> consists of three distinct domains  <cit>  – a central core that includes the evolutionarily-conserved triad of ccch zinc finger motifs that is flanked by novel n- and c-terminal domains . to determine the part of atcpsf <dig> that are important for the interaction inferred by the effects of atcpsf <dig> on atcpsf <dig> localization, two deletion derivatives of atcpsf <dig> were studied. these derivatives, termed m <dig> and m <dig> after delaney et al.  <cit> , lack either the c-terminal or n-terminal domains, respectively; together with the full-sized protein they permit an assignment of interactions to one of the three domains of the protein.

in cells expressing both gfp-atcpsf <dig> and the dsred2-m <dig> mutant, a range of results was obtained. in some cells , gfp-atcpsf <dig> was retained in the nucleus, while the dsred2-m <dig> mutant protein displayed the subcellular distribution seen with dsred2-atcpsf <dig> in the absence of gfp-atcpsf <dig> . in such cells, the distribution of gfp-atcpsf <dig> in these nuclei was similar to that shown in figure  <dig>  panel b, as opposed to the concentration in subnuclear domains seen in figure  <dig>  panels h, k, and n. in some cells , in addition to cytoplasmic dsred2-m <dig>  nuclear accumulation reminiscent of that seen in experiments performed with full-sized dsred2-atcpsf <dig>  was also seen. these results reveal a total  or partial  loss of the interaction between atcpsf <dig> and atcpsf <dig>  such that some cytoplasmic dsred2-m <dig> protein could be seen in cells co-expressing gfp-atcpsf <dig>  thus, the c-terminal domain of atcpsf <dig> seems to be important for efficient interactions with atcpsf <dig> 

in contrast, gfp-atcpsf <dig> co-localized with the dsred2-m <dig> mutant within the nucleus, and no extranuclear dsred2-m <dig> mutant could be seen in cells co-expressing these two proteins . however, the novel subnuclear domains in which the two wild-type proteins accumulated were never seen in the experiments with the dsred2-m <dig> mutant. thus, the dsred2-m <dig> mutant protein retains the ability to interact with gfp-atcpsf <dig>  but has lost the "ability" to change the subnuclear distribution of this protein. in the absence of atcpsf <dig>  the dsred2-m <dig> and dsred2-m <dig> variants were distributed in cells much as were the atcpsf <dig> fusion proteins .

altered subcellular distributions in cells co-expressing atcpsf <dig> with atcpsf <dig> or atcpsf73
consistent with what has been reported elsewhere  <cit> , gfp-atcpsf <dig> co-localized with the nuclear marker  when both were expressed in tobacco cells . remarkably, co-expression of gfp-atcpsf <dig> with dsred2-atcpsf <dig> changed the location of gfp-atcpsf <dig>  such that was it was largely in cytoplasmic foci . these foci also contained dsred2-atcpsf <dig> . this dramatic change in subcellular distribution of gfp-atcpsf <dig> indicates that the interaction between this protein and atcpsf <dig>  <cit>  has the potential to interfere with the nuclear localization of atcpsf <dig> 

similar results were obtained in cells co-expressing gfp-atcpsf <dig> and the dsred2-m <dig> variant . however, the nuclear localization of gfp-atcpsf <dig> was largely restored in cells co-expressing the dsred2-m <dig> variant along with gfp-atcpsf <dig> . in these cases, the dsred2-m <dig> and dsred2-m <dig> variants remained in cytoplasmic foci, much as was seen with the wild-type dsred2-atcpsf <dig>  and with these two proteins when expressed without any cpsf partner . thus, the redistribution of gfp-atcpsf <dig> due to co-expression with dsred2-atcpsf <dig> requires the n-terminal part of atcpsf <dig> 

as was seen with gfp-atcpsf <dig> and gfp-atcpsf <dig>  gfp-atcpsf <dig> was located in the nucleus when co-expressed with the nuclear marker . in cells co-expressing gfp-atcpsf <dig> and dsred2-atcpsf <dig>  gfp-atcpsf <dig> remained largely in the nucleus, although cytoplasmic foci containing gfp-atcpsf <dig> were also discernible . in these cells, dsred2-atcpsf <dig> co-localized with gfp-atcpsf <dig> in the nucleus and cytoplasm . interestingly, nucleus-localized gfp-atcpsf <dig> and dsred2-atcpsf <dig> accumulated in numerous large foci .

in cells co-expressing the dsred2-m <dig> variant along with gfp-atcpsf <dig>  the dsred2-m <dig> protein was found in the cytoplasm but not the nucleus . in these cells, gfp-atcpsf <dig> was found in the nucleus, but the distribution within the nucleus was more similar to the protein in cells that do not express dsred2-atcpsf <dig> . additionally, gfp-atcpsf <dig> could also be found in cytoplasmic foci that also contained the dsred2-m <dig> variant . in cells co-expressing the dsred2-m <dig> mutant and gfp-atcpsf <dig> proteins, gfp-atcpsf <dig> was found predominantly in the nucleus, and the dsred2-m <dig> protein in the cytoplasm , suggestive of a lack of any interaction between these proteins. these results indicate that atcpsf <dig> interacts with atcpsf <dig> in a manner that promotes a substantial nuclear localization of atcpsf <dig>  and that the nuclear localization of atcpsf <dig> in atcpsf73-expressing cells requires the n- and c-terminal domains of atcpsf <dig> 

consistent with a previous study  <cit> , gfp-atcpsf <dig> localized to the nucleus when co-expressed with the nuclear marker . co-expression of gfp-atcpsf <dig> with dsred2-atcpsf <dig> did not alter this distribution . moreover, the cytoplasmic location of dsred2-atcpsf <dig> was not affected by co-expression with gfp-atcpsf73; in particular, no dsred2-atcpsf <dig> could be seen in nuclei. this result is consistent with other results  <cit>  that indicated that these two proteins do not interact.

discussion
on the nature of cpsf in plants
messenger rna 3' end formation occurs in the nucleus, and subunits of the complex that mediate this process are expected to reside within the nucleus. the subject of this study, atcpsf <dig>  can be identified in arabidopsis nuclear extracts and co-purifies with immunoprecipitated atcpsf <dig>  <cit> . thus, it was surprising that this protein, when over-expressed as dsred <dig> or gfp fusions, was not seen in the nucleus. taken together, these studies indicate that atcpsf <dig> itself does not possess nuclear localization information, but rather that it is retained in the nucleus as a consequence of its association with other polyadenylation factor subunits. this hypothesis is supported by the nuclear localization of dsred2-atcpsf <dig> when co-expressed with gfp-atcpsf <dig>  or gfp-atcpsf <dig> . in contrast, co-expression of gfp-atcpsf <dig> with dsred2-atcpsf <dig> causes a re-distribution, not of dsred2-atcpsf <dig> , but rather of gfp-atcpsf <dig> . this result suggests that the atcpsf100-atcpsf <dig> interaction affects the functioning of the nuclear localization information that is inherent in atcpsf <dig>  perhaps owing to physical contacts between atcpsf <dig> and the part of atcpsf <dig> that functions as a nuclear localization signal.

taken together, the patterns of localization seen when atcpsf <dig> is co-expressed with other cpsf subunits raise interesting possibilities regarding the organization and functioning of cpsf in plants. the observation that co-expressed atcpsf <dig> and atcpsf <dig> accumulate largely in the cytoplasm suggests that the nuclear cpsf complex may be organized such that atcpsf <dig> is not in contact with atcpsf <dig>  this in turn raises the possibility that the protein-protein contacts in the nuclear cpsf complex are but a subset of those that have been identified in two-hybrid screens and by direct biochemical assay  <cit> , and lends itself to the idea that cpsf may undergo one or more structural rearrangements in the course of pre-mrna processing.

alternatively, the combination of contacts that are implied by the results of this study , respectively) may be simultaneously in force. this would indicate a hierarchy of functionality of nuclear localization information, such that atcpsf <dig> would remain in the nucleus even though it associates with a protein  that interferes with nuclear localization outside of the context of the complete polyadenylation complex. for example, atcpsf <dig> may supersede the effects of atcpsf <dig> on the localization of atcpsf <dig>  either via the interaction between this subunit and the c-terminus of atcpsf <dig>  or through other interactions such as those between atcpsf <dig>  atcpsf <dig> and atcpsf <dig> described before  <cit> .

arabidopsis possesses two putative homologs of cpsf <dig>  atcpsf <dig> and atcpsf <dig>  <cit> . atcpsf <dig> is more closely related to the canonical cpsf <dig> as well as the yeast homolog ysh <dig>  <cit> , while atcpsf <dig> is more distantly related  <cit> . these two proteins may be distinguished by their differing physiological roles; alterations of atcpsf <dig> expression affect the development of the female gamete in arabidopsis  <cit> , whereas changes in atcpsf <dig> expression lead to male sterility  <cit> . the results presented in this study reveal a biochemical difference between the two cpsf <dig> homologs, in that atcpsf <dig> interacts with atcpsf <dig> so as to promote nuclear localization of the latter protein, while atcpsf <dig> appears not to interact with atcpsf <dig>  whether these differences are the basis for the different physiological functions of the two proteins remains to be determined. however, the possibility attendant with the differences in interactions is supportive of models in which different cpsf complexes exist in plants, complexes that may play specific developmental roles.

these models are not exclusive of one another, and may be combined to yield other variations. the results that inspire them, however, reinforce the suggestion that the nuclear cpsf is a dynamic complex with numerous interesting subtleties.

a refined functional map of atcpsf <dig> – implications for the functioning of the polyadenylation complex
atcpsf <dig> consists of three identifiable domains , demarcated by the central core of three ccch-type zinc finger motifs  <cit> . to date, most of the functionality of the protein has been associated with the central zinc finger core. thus, the first of the three ccch motifs is responsible for the bulk of the rna-binding activity of the protein  <cit> , and the third ccch motif is required for both its endonuclease activity and the interactions of the protein with fip <dig>  <cit> . based on the results of this study, it is apparent that the n-terminal domain is important for the interaction with atcpsf <dig> and atcpsf <dig>  and the c-terminus is needed for the interaction with atcpsf <dig> and to a lesser extent with atcpsf <dig>  with respect to the atcpsf30-atcpsf <dig> interaction, it would seem as if the two contacts implied by the results described here have differing strengths; thus, deletion of the c-terminal domain eliminates the re-distribution of atcpsf <dig> into the nucleus but has a less-perceptible effect on the co-localization of the two proteins in the cytoplasm, while deletion of the n-terminus eliminates all discernible interactions between the two proteins.

the interaction between atcpsf <dig> and atcpsf <dig> that is implicit in the results presented here was unanticipated, as it was not observed in a previous two-hybrid mapping of interactions between arabidopsis polyadenylation factor subunits  <cit> . the reasons for this discrepancy are not clear, but most likely have something to do with the differences in output provided by the two-hybrid assay  <cit>  and co-localization studies. given that two-hybrid assays are known to yield false negatives  <cit> , it is reasonable to assign one more interaction to the hub of interactions that includes atcpsf <dig> 

atcpsf <dig> has a calmodulin-binding site that is located at the junction of the n-terminal domain and the first ccch zinc finger motif  <cit> . it is possible that calmodulin may affect the interactions of atcpsf <dig> with atcpsf <dig> or atcpsf <dig>  and thus provide a link between calcium signaling and the structure of the polyadenylation complex. it is thus of interest to note that atcpsf <dig> has been implicated in the responses of arabidopsis to reactive oxygen species  <cit> ; it is tempting to speculate that calmodulin-mediated remodeling of the polyadenylation complex is involved in this function.

the n- and c-terminal domains of atcpsf <dig> are absent from their animal and yeast counterparts, and are highly variable in plant cpsf <dig> orthologs  <cit> . the involvement of evolutionarily-variable domains in interactions with other cpsf subunits is interesting, because analogous interactions do not seem likely in animals and yeast . this suggests that the mechanisms by which cpsf <dig> is held in the cpsf complex may differ in different organisms. this may have implications for the evolution and function of the polyadenylation complex, especially pertaining to regulated and alternative polyadenylation. for example, cpsf <dig> is the focus of regulatory mechanisms in animals  <cit>  and plants  <cit> ; our results raise the possibility that a similar strategy for posttranscriptional regulation – alternative polyadenylation – may be achieved by somewhat different molecular mechanisms in different organisms, and that these different mechanisms could conceivably involve interactions between cpsf <dig> and other cpsf subunits.

additionally, the fact that cpsf <dig> is a core cpsf subunit in eukaryotes indicates that evolutionarily-conserved interactions with proteins other than canonical cpsf subunits may be integral in the association of cpsf <dig> with the polyadenylation complex. one such interaction is that between cpsf <dig> and fip <dig>  another core cpsf subunit  <cit> . this interaction is conserved in animals, yeast, and plants  <cit> . moreover, in yeast and plants, fip <dig> binds to the same zinc finger motif of cpsf <dig>  <cit> , consistent with an evolutionarily-conserved role for this interaction. while more work is needed to reconcile these various reports, these considerations bring to the fore the cpsf30-fip <dig> interaction as one of central importance for the polyadenylation complex.

a cytoplasmic cpsf in plants?
the cytoplasmic locations of atcpsf <dig>  atcpsf <dig>  and atcpsf <dig> seen in this study are provocative in that they suggest that plants may possess a cytoplasmic complex that includes cpsf subunits. of course, these cytoplasmic distributions may have limited physiological relevance, as they may be nothing more than reflections of the locations of proteins that are expressed far above levels usually seen in the cell. the association of atcpsf <dig> with the er, the site of protein degradation induced by the unfolded protein response  <cit>  is consistent with this possibility. however, given that the cytoplasmic colocalization of atcpsf <dig> seems to require an intact atcpsf <dig> capable of engaging in protein-protein interactions, it seems unlikely that overexpressed atcpsf <dig> or atcpsf <dig> are unfolded or otherwise denatured in a manner that might trigger an unfolded protein response. generally speaking, the promoters used in this study do not lead to high enough expression levels to cause rampant protein mis-localization or degradation  <cit> . also, the co-localization of atcpsf <dig> and dcp <dig> in the cytoplasm is hard to rationalize in this context. however, we cannot completely rule out this possibility.

the alternative is that the cytoplasmic locations of cpsf subunits that we describe are indications of the existence, in plants, of a cytoplasmic cpsf complex. in animals, cytoplasmic forms of cpsf have been identified and characterized. for example, in xenopus oocytes, cpsf functions in the cytoplasm as part of the complex that regulates the polyadenylation and deadenylation of stored cytoplasmic mrnas  <cit> . it may be that the cytoplasmic cpsf-containing foci reported here are analogous in some ways to the xenopus cytoplasmic polyadenylation complex.

yet another alternative is suggested by the observation that atcpsf <dig> co-localizes with atdcp <dig> . in animals and yeast, dcp <dig> is a component of the so-called processing body , a dynamic organelle that is involved in mrna storage, decapping, and degradation. in plants, dcp <dig> occurs in a cytoplasmic location along with dcp <dig> and varicose, a wd repeat-containing protein  <cit> . these foci are likely the arabidopsis counterparts of p-bodies, locations of mrna decapping and breakdown. the association of atcpsf <dig> with dcp <dig> is interesting, as it insinuates cpsf into the mrna-degrading system. such a possibility lends itself to numerous future studies, and may lead to a more integrated view of rna metabolism in plants.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the results presented in this paper reveal that the distribution of the arabidopsis cpsf <dig> within the cell is defined by its interactions with other cpsf subunits, and that this protein in turn affects the distribution of some cpsf subunits. they also show that the interactions between atcpsf <dig> and other cpsf subunits involve plant-specific domains of atcpsf <dig>  indicative of a degree of evolutionary novelty in the functioning of atcpsf <dig>  these results lend themselves to interesting possibilities for the structure and functioning of cpsf, and they raise new possibilities for the roles of cpsf in rna processing and metabolism in plants.
