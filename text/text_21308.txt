BACKGROUND
since the initial discovery of the lin- <dig> mirna  <cit> , and then of the let- <dig> mirna which is highly conserved in evolution  <cit> , combined experimental and computational approaches have resulted in the identification of hundreds of mirnas in animal genomes, some of the large-scale studies being  <cit> . in contrast, high-throughput approaches for experimental identification of mirna targets are only in their infancy  <cit> , and global properties of mirna-dependent regulatory networks have mostly been inferred from computationally-predicted target sites  <cit> .

perhaps surprisingly, relatively little is known about the constraints on a functional mirna target site. mutational studies  <cit>  confirmed initial observations of lai  <cit>  and lewis et al.  <cit>  that perfect base pairing between the 5' end of the mirna and its target is essential. as a consequence, some of the computational methods for mirna target prediction require  <cit>  or can enforce the constraint  <cit>  that 6– <dig> nucleotides at the 5' end of the mirna, the so-called mirna "seed", are perfectly base paired with its mrna target, or give a higher weight to the base pairs formed in this region  <cit> . since every 6mer occurs on average once every  <dig>  nucleotides in random sequence, the number of target sites for each mirna would be very large if matching of the seed were the only requirement for functional target sites. although there are indications that mirnas do have a large number of targets  <cit> , experimental studies typically do not confirm that every seed match constitutes a functional target site. it seems therefore that additional factors contribute to the functionality of target sites. to improve the specificity of prediction of functional target sites, most computational studies make use of evolutionarily conservation  <cit>  or at least flag conserved putative targets  <cit> . however, currently available methods generally use conservation statistics in an ad hoc manner. in particular, existing methods do not explicitly take the phylogenetic relationships into account when weighing the evidence of conservation between related species. in addition, current methods treat all mirnas identically and ignore that the selection pressures for conserving functional target sites between related species may differ significantly between mirnas. that is, functional target sites for one mirna may be preferentially conserved in one subset of species, whereas the functional sites for another mirna may be preferentially conserved in another subset of species. incorporating conservation statistics in a general, rigorous and mirna-dependent manner are the main features of the mirna target prediction method that we present here.

from the very early stages of mirna target prediction it became clear that regulatory proteins such as transcription factors are preferentially subjected to mirna-dependent regulation. yet, beyond a few well-characterized mirna-target interactions, there is still very little known about the place of individual mirnas in the regulatory networks of cells and organs. several groups  <cit>  have used gene ontology categories in an attempt to characterize the biological roles of different mirnas. here we present a new analysis based on the association of targets for individual mirnas with molecular pathways annotated in the kegg database. this approach recovers some of the known mirna-mrna associations, and makes new predictions, in particular it predicts the for the involvement of specific mirnas in nervous system development, inter-cellular communication, and cell growth.

RESULTS
mirna-target interactions: the importance of different 'seed types'
several lines of evidence  <cit>  suggest that complementarity of the target site to the first  <dig> bases at the 5' end of the mirna are of crucial importance for target site recognition. lewis et al.  <cit>  have investigated the importance of the mirna "seed", defined as the positions 2– <dig> of the mirna, by comparing conservation statistics of mrna segments that are complementary to mirna seeds with those of randomized control sets. they concluded that conserved 3' utr regions predicted to hybridize perfectly with positions 2– <dig> of the mirna or with positions 2– <dig> of the mirna, but having an a nucleotide flanking the seed match at the 3' end are likely to be mirna target sites. inspired by these methods we decided to re-investigate the conservation statistics of different "seed types" across different clades of organisms. in all cases, we only focused on the first  <dig> positions of the mirna, and we analyzed the following  <dig> "seed types" :

 <dig>  perfect complementarity with watson-crick interactions between positions 1– <dig> of the mirna and the mrna target site.

 <dig>  perfect complementarity at positions 1– <dig> but not at position  <dig> 

 <dig>  perfect complementarity at positions 2– <dig> but not at position  <dig> 

 <dig>  perfect complementarity at 2– <dig> but not at  <dig> and  <dig> 

 <dig>  complementarity at positions 1– <dig> with a single g-u pair occurring with the u in the mirna .

 <dig>  complementarity at positions 1– <dig> with a single g-u pair occurring with the u in the target .

 <dig>  complementarity with a single bulged nucleotide on the mirna side .

 <dig>  complementarity with a single bulged nucleotide on the target side .

 <dig>  complementarity with a single internal loop involving one nucleotide in both mirna and target .

for each of these  <dig> seed types t, and each of the four clades , we determined the fraction ft of putative target sites that are perfectly conserved in all species of the clade . we only considered mirnas that were themselves conserved in all species of the clade. we also determined the "background" conservation fraction, of randomly chosen 3' utr sequence segments of the same length as the respective seed types that are conserved in all species of the clade. figure  <dig> shows the ratio of these two fractions, which we called "conservation fold enrichment". as expected, octameric sites show most evidence of functionality. the conservation fold enrichment decreases dramatically as the extent of complementarity that we require between mirna and putative target site decreases. in particular, sites in which only the nucleotides 2– <dig> of the mirna are predicted to form base pairs with the mrna, as well as sites predicted to form g-u base pairs or to contain internal loops show relative little evidence of conservation enrichment. this is not to say that such sites are never functional. indeed, functional target sites of this type are known, in particular in worms  <cit> , for which, interestingly, we observe the strongest evidence of selection on these seed types. however, for our target prediction method we decided to focus on the three seed types that show strong evidence of conservation enrichment across all clades: those with perfect watson-crick complementarity with positions 1– <dig>  2– <dig>  or 1– <dig> of the mirna. as a result, we predict the same set of target sites for different mirnas with the same first  <dig> nucleotides. in reality, even though the seed is probably most important for targeting, the 3' ends may also contribute to the target selection and this could differentiate the target sets for different mirnas with the same seed. this possibility, which has been studied experimentally by brennecke et al.  <cit> , and is explicitly incorporated in other target prediction models  <cit> , is not captured by our model. note, however, that because the mirna-mediated targeting depends on the expression of both mirna and targets, distinct mirnas that have the same seed sequence may still have different target sets simply due to differences in their expression profile, even though in principle they recognize the same set of target sites. note also that we do not use a model in which the mrna position corresponding to the first nucleotide in mirna is an adenosine, because we did not find this constraint to consistently improve the conservation fold enrichment across all clades .

bayesian phylogenetic model for mirna target sites
we have developed a bayesian probabilistic model for assigning, to each putative "site" in a 3' utr that is complementary to a mirna seed, a posterior probability that the site is a functional target site for the mirna, meaning that the site has been selected in evolution for its ability to bind the mirna. the details of the model are described in the methods section, but the main ingredients are the following.

for each mirna and each seed type t we collect all putative sites in the 3' utrs of the reference species of the clade in question, i.e. the 3' utr sequence segments that are complementary to the given mirna seed. for each of these putative sites we then determine the conservation pattern c→

generally, if conservation patterns with many ci =  <dig> are much more abundant among putative mirna sites than among background sites, then we infer that a fraction of the putative target sites must be functional and that selection has maintained these sites in some of the species. however, conserved target sites need not be functional in all species in which they occur. the conservation pattern of a given site is typically the result of selection maintaining the site in some of the species in combination with chance conservation of the site in other species, in particular those that are evolutionarily close. our model flexibly and explicitly takes this into account. the model considers all possible "selection patterns" s→

for each mirna we then determine the frequencies p of different selection patterns that maximize the overall likelihood of the observed counts n. that is, we determine the distribution of selection patterns p that best explains the observed counts n of conservation patterns for this mirna.

using the estimated frequencies p we can then determine, for each putative target site, the posterior probability that the site is functional given its conservation pattern c→

phylogenetic distribution of functional target sites across mirnas
note that the estimated distribution over selection patterns p quantifies what fraction of putative sites in the reference species is under selection in each of the possible subsets of other species. that is, p estimates how functional target sites are distributed over the phylogenetic tree. since we estimate p independently for each mirna, our method allows us to compare how functional sites are distributed across the phylogenetic tree for different mirnas. in figure  <dig> we show the inferred phylogenetic distribution of functional target sites for  <dig> different human mirnas. the genes of these mirnas are conserved across all vertebrates shown in the figure. the precise parameters of the distributions p are represented by the bars at each node with red indicating the fraction of sites that remains under selection in the left descending branch only, blue the fraction that remains under selection in the right descending branch only, and green the fraction that remains under selection in both descending branches. the distribution p is also summarized in the thickness of the branches of each tree. starting from the root  the thickness of each branch indicates what fraction of functional target sites is under selection along that branch. note that the initial branch leading away from human has the same thickness for all four mirnas, meaning that the fraction of human target sites that is under selection in at least one of the other species is roughly equal for these  <dig> mirnas. however, as the figure shows, the two mirnas on the left and the two mirnas on the right differ significantly in the inferred pattern of selection across the tree. in particular, whereas the target sites for the mirnas on the right  tend to be shared between all mammals, and to some extent with chicken and opossum, the target sites for the mirnas on the right  are shared mostly among primates, but not with other mammals. this suggests that, whereas the target repertoires of mir- <dig> and mir-124a have been largely conserved since the common ancestor of the mammals, significant changes have occurred in the target repertoires of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> since that time. in additional file  <dig> we show the parameters of the inferred selection distributions p for all mirnas that are conserved across all warm-blooded vertebrates that we considered. these results provide a first comprehensive look into the species-specific targets of mirnas.

because we infer different distributions p for different mirnas, and these distributions enter as priors in the bayesian procedure, we generally assign different posterior probabilities to sites for different mirnas, even if these sites have exactly the same conservation pattern. for example, in the example above a site for mirna mir- <dig> that is only conserved in primates would get considerably higher posterior probability than a site for mir- <dig> with the same conservation pattern. this is because this conservation pattern corresponds better to the inferred selection pattern of mir- <dig> than the inferred selection pattern of mir- <dig> 

one of the issues that has been extensively discussed in the mirna literature is the question of the typical number of functional targets per mirna, and the related question of what fraction of seed matches in 3' utrs corresponds to functional target sites. previous work has indicated that the number of targets per mirna varies across mirnas  <cit> . we believe that the ability of our method to infer species-specific mirna targeting for each mirna, allows for a more sensitive and accurate estimation of the total number of functional target sites of each mirna.

there are two independent contributions to the total number of functional target sites for a given mirna. first, the total number of mirna seed matches varies from mirna to mirna and second, the fraction of seed matches that correspond to functional sites may vary from mirna to mirna. the latter can be estimated from the conservation evidence. in particular, the inferred parameter ρ of the distribution p, corresponds to the fraction of mirna seed matches that is under selection in the reference species and at least one of the other species in the clade. this provides a lower bound on the fraction of seed matches that is functional in the reference species . by multiplying this fraction ρ by the total number of seed matches for the mirna we obtain a lower bound on the absolute number of functional target sites for the mirna. for simplicity we will refer to these as the estimated fraction of functional sites, and the estimated total number of functional sites. figure  <dig> shows the estimated fraction of functional sites as a function of the estimated total number of functional target sites, for each clade of species and each mirna. we infer that the number of functional target sites varies very widely across mirnas, i.e. from almost zero to several thousands. similarly, the fraction of target sites under selection varies from close to zero to almost 50% in human, or even more in worms and flies. overall we find that the average of ρ is about 30% for human, fly, and worm, meaning that we predict that at least 30% of mirna seed matches in these species is functional. the inferred fractions ρ are significantly lower in fish. this is most likely because the reference species  is relatively far  from the other species in the clade , so that there is a smaller fraction of sites that is under selection in at least one of the other species. it is intriguing that, for all four clades, there seems to be a correlation between the fraction ρ and the inferred total number of functional sites at small values of ρ, but no correlation at high values of ρ.

the number of predicted sites under selection does not appear to correlate with the breadth of mirna expression, as among the mirnas with the largest number of predicted target sites we find some that are highly tissue specific  as well some that have broad expression . mir- <dig>  which is ubiquitously expressed  <cit>  has an intermediate number of targets .

performance comparison with other methods
to assess the quality of our predictions relative to other methods that have been published to date, we built on the results recently published by stark et al.  <cit> , who have performed a detailed comparison of the performance of most of the prediction methods that are currently in use on a relatively large set of experimentally tested mirna-mrna interactions. this experimental data set has been mostly obtained by the cohen lab, with a small number of interactions having been tested by other groups. the issues concerning the biases involved with the assembly of this data set have already been discussed by stark et al.  <cit> , and we will not belabor them here. we will only caution the reader that the accuracy of various different methods on this data set should not be taken as an indication of their accuracy on a random set of mirna-mrna interactions. unfortunately, this unbiased experiment has not been done.

since our method assigns a posterior probability to each predicted site, sets of predictions at different levels of confidence can be obtained by including only sites over a given posterior probability. we created such sets at different thresholds in posterior probability and computed the sensitivity  and the specificity 
 mathtype@mtef@5@5@+=feaafiart1ev1aaatcvaufkttlearuwrp9mdh5mbpbiqv92aaexatlxbi9gbaebbnrfifhhdyfgasaach8aky=wiffydh8gipec8eeeu0xxdbba9frfj0=oqffea0dxdd9vqai=hguq8kuc9pgc9s8qqaq=dirpe0xb9q8qilsfr0=vr0=vr0dc8meaabaqaciaacagaaeqabaqabegadaaakeaacqggoaakdawcaaqaaiabdsfaujabd6eaobqaaiabdaeagjabdcfaqjabgucariabdsfaujabd6eaobaacqggpaqkaaa@363a@) i.e. the fraction of all the correct negative predictions) for each set. the results are shown as the black line in figure  <dig>  which also shows the sensitivities and specificities of other prediction methods  <cit> , as inferred from the published results.

the figure indicates that our method performs as well as the most accurate prediction methods available to date, while maintaining a very high specificity even for high sensitivities. we observe a large overlap between our predicted targets and those predicted by stark et al.  <cit>  and grün et al.  <cit>  although there are also substantial numbers of predicted sites that are either specific to our method or specific to one of the other methods. the significant overlap is most likely a reflection of the similarity in the definition of target sites: 7/8-nucleotide seed matches that are conserved across at least some of the other flies account for a large fraction of the predicted sites in all three methods. however, these other methods also consider putative sites with fewer matches in the seed region if they are sufficiently conserved  <cit>  or compensated by matches to the 3' end of the mirna  <cit> . the very good accuracy of our predictions indicates that appropriately weighing the evolutionary information enables us to achieve a good performance even with more restrictive definition of putative target sites compared to thee other methods. in particular, we note that from a total of  <dig>  high confidence predicted sites , a substantial proportion, namely  <dig>  , are not perfectly conserved in drosophila pseudoobscura, but are conserved in many of the other flies. such sites will be missed by methods that only consider strict conservation in d. pseudoobscura.

in additional file  <dig> we show a detailed comparison of our predicted target sets for fly mirnas and those reported by stark et al.  <cit>  and grün et al.  <cit> . we defined a utr to be a predicted target of a specific mirna if it had at least  <dig>  probability of containing a functional site for the mirna . because the utr data sets used by different groups differs to some extent, we have used a conservative scheme of computing the overlap: we have assumed that whenever another method predicted a site in a splice variant of a given gene, all the variants would share the site. thus, the numbers below represent upper bounds on the extent of overlap between the different methods. note additionally that the total number of predictions made by other methods may not be the number of predictions reported in the respective studies, but include all the splice variants known to date. the overlap between our predictions and those of stark et al.  <cit>  and grün et al.  <cit>  varies significantly between mirnas. for example, for the bantam mirnas, which has shown to be involved in the regulation of cell growth  <cit> , the overlap is quite large. we predict  <dig> targets of which  <dig>  and  <dig>  occur in the predictions of stark et al.  <cit>  and grün et al.  <cit> , respectively. the discrepancy is higher for mir- <dig>  a mirna required for muscle development  <cit> . we predict  <dig> targets of which  <dig>  and  <dig>  occur among the predictions of stark et al.  <cit>  and grün et al.  <cit> , respectively. finally, for another microrna, mir- <dig>  we make only a total of  <dig> predictions of which only  <dig>  and  <dig>  occur among the predictions of stark et al.  <cit>  and grün et al.  <cit> , respectively. that is, at least half of our predicted targets are not predicted by the other two algorithms. unfortunately, the data set of experimentally tested mirna-mrna interactions is too small to meaningfully compare the predictions of the different methods for individual mirnas.

location bias of predicted mirna target sites in utrs
we next turned to the high-confidence  subset of our predicted mirna target sites and we asked whether we could identify a bias in the location of evolutionarily selected mirna target sites in the 3' utrs. figure  <dig> shows a heat map representation of the location of these sites along the 3' utrs in the different clades. in this plot, each predicted mirna target site is represented as a dot with its x-coordinate being the total length of the 3'utr in which it resides and its y-coordinate being the relative, normalized position of the site in the utr. we infer that in all clades, the high-confidence sites tend to avoid the regions immediately after the stop codon as well as the end of the transcript. at the 3' end, this effect could be due to the presence of polya tails in some of the refseq transcripts. in human, where the utrs are much longer than in the other species considered , conserved mirna target sites also tend to avoid the regions in the middle of long utrs. this pattern is mirrored in the conservation profile across long utrs, i.e. long utrs tend to be less conserved in the middle than toward their ends . the pattern is also observed at the level of predicted target sites for individual mirnas , i.e it is not caused by one or two mirnas with an aberrant target site distribution.

a conceivable explanation for the observed pattern of enrichment of mirna sites toward the start and end of long utrs is that a non-negligible proportion of long refseq utrs erroneously contains introns. to test this hypothesis we obtained all est sequences that overlap refseq utrs and calculated, for each utr base, the fraction of all overlapping ests in which the base is intronic. as shown in additional file  <dig>  there is almost no difference between the intron-inclusion profiles for long and short 3' utrs. that is, the observed enrichment of mirna sites toward the ends of long 3' utrs cannot be explained by intron inclusion.

the observed pattern is interesting because it has been argued  <cit>  that mirnas are a major factor driving the evolution of utr lengths: ubiquitously-expressed genes have short utrs, while genes whose expression is more restricted and regulated by mirnas have longer utrs. our result suggests a more complicated scenario, in which more strongly conserved mirna target sites, which have most likely emerged early, are located towards the boundaries of the 3' utr, the stop codon and the polyadenylation site. this particular location of target sites may influence the likelihood of interaction between the mirna-containing ribonucleoproteins and other complexes involved in rna processing and regulation.

inference of mirna function using pathway analysis
to analyze the role that individual mirnas play in the regulatory networks in human, we have used the kegg database in which a large fraction of the human genes are assigned to pathways. kegg provides a mapping between genes and pathways, as well as a reference to the identifier of each of the genes in the gene database of ncbi. based on this mapping, as well as on the assignment of refseq identifiers to gene identifiers which we obtained from ncbi, we have constructed an assignment between putative mirna targets and pathways. the resulting dataset consisted of  <dig>   <dig> human refseq transcripts. using putative target sites with posterior probability of ≥  <dig> , we have determined which pathways are significantly associated with each individual mirna . in particular, for each mirna/pathway combination we calculated the log-likelihood ratio, given the observed data, of two models: one that assumes that pathway membership and being a predicted target of the mirna are independent, and one that assumes that these are generally dependent properties.

the first thing to note is that, as reported previously  <cit> , genes that are ubiquitous and are involved in basic metabolic functions, tend to be depleted in mirna target sites. also noted before is that mirnas tend to target genes involved in transcription regulation, intercellular communication, cell growth and death and development  <cit> . for example, we find that the targets of  <dig> of the  <dig> unique mirna seeds are significantly enriched in the axon guidance pathway. this does not necessarily imply, however, that all these mirnas are specifically involved in axon guidance. many of the molecules involved in axon guidance are also involved in delivering spatial cues during the development of other systems, such as for example the cardiovascular system. so it is plausible that, whereas many mirnas are associated with the axon guidance pathway, different mirnas may act on different subsets of the mrnas from this pathway in different tissues. below we describe some of the most notable associations that we found between specific mirnas and pathways.

our method yields the expected associations for mirnas which are specifically expressed in certain tissues , or for mirnas for which targets are already known. mir-124a, whose expression is highly specific to the nervous system, is one of the mirnas most significantly associated with the axon guidance pathway. its corresponding targets in this pathway include players with known involvement in nervous system development such as the ephrins b <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig>  ephrin receptors a <dig>  a <dig>  and b <dig>  semaphorins 5a, 6a, 6c, and 6d, and plexins a <dig> and b <dig>  as mir- <dig> is highly expressed in mature neurons, it is possible that its function is to maintain previously established neuronal circuits.

our results also suggest an involvement of the mir- <dig> family of mirnas in nervous system. these mirnas, whose expression in zebrafish appears to be restricted to the nervous system, thymus and gills  <cit> , have so far been shown to play a role in lymphocyte  <cit>  and muscle  <cit>  development. in our data, they have a set of high confidence targets in the long term potentiation pathway, among which glutamate receptors, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii, adenylate cyclate  <dig>  and calmodulin. in fact, calcium/calmodulin kinase ii  <dig> appears to play a role in both memory performance  <cit>  and in activation-induced t cell differentiation  <cit> . these results may explain the up-to-now puzzling expression pattern of these mirnas.

the let- <dig> mirna, which was recently shown to regulate the let- <dig> gene in c. elegans and is presumed to regulate the human homologs of let- <dig>  i.e. the ras genes  <cit> , is most significantly associated with the mapk pathway, with the nras gene and the ras guanyl releasing protein  <dig> rasgrp <dig> being predicted as high confidence targets. additionally, let- <dig> is predicted to target several kinases and phosphatases in this pathway, and, importantly for the postulated involvement of let- <dig> in malignancy, the fas ligand, tgfβ receptor i, nerve growth factor and fibroblast growth factor  <dig> 

mir- <dig> has been described as a brain-specific mirna  <cit> , and recent evidence suggests that its expression is highest in fetal brain and oligodendrogliomas  <cit> . the top pathway associated with this mirna is that of glutamate metabolism, in which mir- <dig> appears to target glutamate decarboxylase, glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamase, glutamate-cysteine ligase, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase  <dig>  as well as glucosamine-phosphate n-acetyltransferase  <dig>  4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase. the second most significant association for mir- <dig> is with with the focal adhesion pathway, in which many more genes appear to be targeted, among which collagen v α <dig>  collagen iv α <dig>  integrin  <dig>  tenascin c, talin, trombospondin  <dig>  and vinculin. these targets suggest that mir- <dig> may be involved in regulating the intercellular communication in the brain and the function of neural circuits. another group of mirnas for which we suggest a role a development, in particular in the nervous system, is that of the embryonic mirnas exemplified by mir- <dig>  initially identified in a study of human embryonic stem cells  <cit> . these mirnas appear to be primate-specific. however, the nucleotides at position 2– <dig>  aagugc, are shared by the 5' ends of several other mirnas that are embryonically-expressed and of restricted phylogenetic distribution such as the rodent mir- <dig> , mir- <dig> , mir- <dig> , and mir- <dig> , zebrafish mir-430's , as well as the human mir- <dig> group , mir- <dig> , and most mirnas of the mir- <dig> group . of these mirnas, the study of  <cit>  implicated mir- <dig> in the nervous system development in zebrafish, although in a subsequent study the authors showed that mir- <dig> plays a role in the clearance of maternal rnas  <cit> . our results speak to the first proposed role of this class of mirnas, namely in nervous system development. the mir-372-related mirnas  have a strong predicted association with the axon guidance pathway, where it is predicted to target, among others, the ephrin b <dig>  ephrin receptors a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  semaphorin 4b, lim kinase  <dig>  and p21-activated kinase  <dig>  moreover, at least some of the smad genes that are part of the top pathway predicted to be targeted by these mirnas, the tgfβ pathway, have been implicated in the growth of neurites  <cit> . interestingly, the difference a vs. u or g at the first position between the mir- <dig> and other families mentioned above leads to quite different predictions of targeted pathways. for none of these other mirnas have we found a pathway that appears to be significantly targeted.

finally, we were very interested in understanding the function of mir- <dig> , a mirna that appears to be ubiquitously expressed at least in mouse  <cit> , and has been implicated in regulation of apoptosis  <cit>  and of mrna stability  <cit> . we find that the most significant association of mir- <dig> is with the mtor signaling pathway  <cit> , which integrates nutrient-derived signals and controls cell growth. mir- <dig> appears to target the rapamycin-insensitive companion of mtor, several ribosomal protein kinases, components of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig> , insulin-like growth factor  <dig> and others. the second most significant association of this mirna is with the wnt pathway, in which it targets several wnt , a wnt inhibitor  and cyclin  proteins, and the third most significant association is focal adhesion, where mir- <dig> appears to target a large number of transcripts that have fundamental role in cell division and cell-cell communication. some examples are again the cyclins d <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig>  cell division cycle  <dig>  p21-activated kinase  <dig> , v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog  <dig> , v-crk sarcoma virus ct <dig> oncogene homolog -like , mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase  <dig> , laminin gamma  <dig>  b-cell cll/lymphoma  <dig> , and others. these suggest a fundamental role of mir- <dig> in controlling cell growth and maintaining cell-cell interactions. these functions may explain the observed association between mir-16/mir-15a deletions and chronic lymphocytic leukemia  <cit> , and the slower progression of cll in mice treated with rapamycin  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
as the number of mirna genes has been growing steadily, especially through high-throughput cloning techniques, the number of experimentally validated targets has been lagging markedly behind. recently, studies that take advantage of the fact that mirnas appear to also induce partial degradation of their mrna targets have used microarray methodology to identify genes whose expression changes upon over-expression or knock-down of individual mirnas. typically hundreds of putative targets are identified in such studies but there is only partial overlap between these sets of putative targets and those that are computationally predicted using comparative genomics methods. computational modeling of mirna-mrna interaction and accurate prediction of mirna target sites therefore remains an important and challenging problem in bioinformatics. in particular, it is still poorly understood what constraints beyond matching of the mirna seed determine functionality of putative target sites.

in this study, we developed a general method for mirna target prediction that extends the already available methods in several ways. first, we treat the phylogenetic relationships between species in a rigorous and general way, without any tunable parameters. that is, the bayesian procedure uniquely determines the posterior probabilities for each conservation pattern and seed type in terms of the observed conservation patterns of target sites for each mirna. thus, in contrast to many other target predictions methods which are specifically tailored to operate on a particular clade of species, our method can be applied to any clade of species, and the phylogenetic relations between the species will be automatically taken into account when assessing the significance of the site conservation patterns. this will, for example, enable us to easily update our predictions as more genomes become available, without the need of adapting the method.

note also that our bayesian procedure for incorporating information from conservation statistics is generally independent from the "site" definition that we employ and can easily be applied to other target site definitions . thus, if a better definition of target sites is developed in the future, for example through a better understanding of the requirements on functional mirna target sites, then we can easily adapt the method to incorporate conservation statistics in essentially the same way. most generally put, given a binary function that distinguishes "sites" from "non-sites" in rna sequences, and given a set of "background frequencies" p with which sites defined by such a function show conservation pattern c→

second, we estimate the evolution of selection pressures on target sites in a mirna-specific manner. this enables us to correctly treat mirnas that appeared at different stages in evolution, and whose targets may have undergone different selection pressures in different lineages. in particular, we show that different mirnas show markedly different distributions of functional target sites across the phylogenetic tree and provide the first comprehensive picture of species-specific and clade-specific mirna targeting. we have additionally shown that, especially in long 3' utrs that occur in vertebrates, mirna target sites show a significant bias toward occurrence near the start and end of the 3' utr. this suggests the possibility that the choice of a distal polyadenylation site may reduce the activity of a mirna target cassette in the center of the 3' utr, while introducing other mirna target sites close to the new polya tail.

with respect to the performance of our algorithm, we have shown that in fly, where extensive comparisons of the performance of target prediction algorithms have been done, our method performs at least as well as the most accurate methods available today, with a high specificity over a relatively large range of sensitivities.

finally, to more robustly infer the function of individual mirnas, each of whom may target hundreds of transcripts, we developed a method for identifying biochemical pathways that are significantly enriched or depleted in targets of a specific mirna. we showed that, for well-studied mirnas, this approach recovers the known functional associations. in addition, this analysis predicts novel pathway associations for a significant number of mirnas.
