BACKGROUND
wnt signaling is of critical importance in several stages of kidney development. mutual inductive interactions between the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme drive nephrogenesis  <cit> . the ureteric bud synthesizes wnt9b, which is essential for induction of the mesenchyme to form nephrons  <cit> . wnt <dig> is made by the induced metanephric mesenchyme and is also required for nephrogenesis  <cit> . furthermore, wnt <dig>  secreted by the ureteric bud tips, participates in a positive feedback loop promoting glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor  expression by the metanephric mesenchyme  <cit> . mutations in wnt9b or wnt <dig> result in a dramatic block in nephron formation, while wnt <dig> mutants show a significant reduction in nephron number. it is interesting to note that wnt <dig> and wnt <dig> have been shown to signal, at least in some cases, through noncanonical pathways  <cit> , while there is evidence indicating that wnt9b activates canonical wnt signaling in the kidney  <cit> .

genetic studies in drosophila have identified the pygopus  gene as a critical component of canonical wnt signaling  <cit> . pygo and lgs interact with β-catenin during the formation of the canonical transcriptional complex and are required for accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus  <cit> . lgs binds the central armadillo repeats of β-catenin, while pygo interacts with lgs, mediating activation of wnt targets  <cit> . the n-terminal domain of pygo is required for wnt transcriptional activation, while the phd motif is required for the association of pygo with lgs  <cit> . additionally, a putative nuclear localization signal  was identified within the n-terminal domain of pygo, suggesting a possible role of nuclear importation of β-catenin  <cit> . analyses of multiple aspects of the pygopus mutant phenotype indicate that this gene is dedicated to, and required for, canonical wnt signaling during drosophila development  <cit> .

the mammalian genome carries two, and only two, orthologs of drosophila pygo, pygo <dig> and pygo <dig>  <cit> . in this report, we generated targeted mutations of pygo <dig> and pygo <dig> to determine their functions, with a particular interest in the contributions of these genes to canonical wnt signaling during kidney development. the resulting double-homozygous mutant embryos showed a context-dependent reduction in canonical wnt signaling as measured by wnt reporter transgene expression. development remained, however, surprisingly normal, with survival to birth and few apparent defects in most organ systems. our phenotypic analysis focused on the kidney, which showed altered branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud, and expansion of the zone of condensed mesenchyme surrounding the ureteric bud, yet relatively normal nephron formation, as measured by histology, confocal analysis, in situ hybridization and microarray analysis. the obvious conclusion is that in mammals, unlike drosophila, pygopus-mediated canonical wnt signaling is not absolutely necessary in most developing organ systems.

RESULTS
pygo <dig> and pygo <dig> targeted mutations
we targeted both the pygo <dig> and pygo <dig> genes by inserting loxp sequences to flank critical coding regions including the phd domains. the resulting targeted mice were mated with transgenic cmv-cre mice  <cit>  to drive germline loxp recombination, resulting in the null mutant alleles that were used for this study. pcr confirmed the deletion of the bulk of the coding sequences for both genes, including 89% of coding sequence for pygo <dig> and 87% of coding sequence for pygo <dig>  previous studies in drosophila have shown that even a single missense mutation in the phd domain can eliminate pygo function in wnt signaling  <cit> .

pygo <dig> and pygo <dig> mutant phenotypes
pygo <dig> homozygous null mice were viable and fertile with no developmental defects detectable. this was surprising given the importance of the pygopus gene in wnt signaling in drosophila, and the reported expression during development of the mouse pygo <dig> gene in, for example, the brain, limbs, kidney and branchial arches  <cit>  .

the pygo <dig> homozygous null mice survived to birth, but with rare exceptions, died shortly afterwards. the gut, heart and limbs developed without detectable abnormality  despite known requirements for wnt signaling. the pygo <dig> mutants did, however, show growth retardation, lens agenesis and a kidney phenotype with high penetrance, exencephaly, and cleft palate with incomplete penetrance.

double-homozygous mutant pygo <dig> and pygo <dig> mice had a phenotype similar to that of single pygo <dig> nulls . there was no significant synergism of developmental abnormalities in the double mutants. together these results suggest that pygo <dig> is required for the proper development of a limited number of structures, whereas pygo <dig> is not necessary for normal development.

expression of pygo <dig> and pygo <dig> in the developing kidney
in situ hybridization has been used previously to characterize expression of pygo <dig>  <cit> . in this report, we used immunofluorescence to better define the expression patterns of the pygo <dig> and pygo <dig> genes in the developing kidney. both genes were widely expressed, showing nuclear localization of encoded proteins in the ureteric bud, capping mesenchyme, and stromal cells . raised expression of pygo <dig>  and to a lesser degree of pygo <dig>  was seen in stromal cells, and significant nuclear staining was detected in essentially all cells of the developing kidney for both proteins.

confocal analysis of pygo1/pygo <dig> mutant kidneys
histological examination of pygo <dig> null and pygo1/pygo <dig> double-null mutant kidneys did not reveal any abnormalities in nephrogenesis . confocal analysis was therefore performed to characterize renal development in e <dig>  pygo1/pygo <dig> null kidneys more precisely . wt <dig>  and cited <dig>  antibodies both stain the capping metanephric mesenchyme around the ureteric bud tips  <cit> . wt <dig> antibody also stains renal vesicles and glomerular anlage. antibodies to cdh <dig>  also known as e-cadherin , were used to identify epithelial structures, including the branching ureteric bud and nascent nephrons of the developing kidney  <cit> . dolichos biflorus  lectin  <cit>  was used to selectively stain ureteric bud-derived structures  <cit> .

wt <dig> and cited <dig>  staining revealed an increase of approximately 30% in the thickness of the capping mesenchyme surrounding the mutant ureteric buds . nevertheless, the mutant metanephric mesenchyme underwent relatively normal nephrogenesis. cdh1-staining nephrons  were identified connecting to the ureteric bud tips  <cit>  and extending into the medulla of the kidney, as normal. intermediate structures of nephrogenesis, including renal vesicles, comma-shaped bodies, and s-shaped bodies appeared normal.

confocal analysis also showed that the ureteric bud tips  <cit>  of pygo1/pygo <dig> null kidneys were dilated and misshaped compared with those of littermates with at least one wild-type pygo <dig> allele . in addition, the pygo1/pygo <dig> double-homozygous mutant kidneys also had a decrease of approximately 25% in the number of ureteric bud tips per area compared with littermates with at least one wild-type copy of pygo <dig> . no significant difference in ureteric bud-tip density was seen between pygo2+/- and pygo2+/+ embryos .

in situ hybridization
we examined expression of three wnt genes in pygo mutants. wnt7b is expressed in the stalks  <cit> , wnt <dig> in the tips  <cit> , and wnt9b in the stalks and weakly in the tips of the branching ureteric bud  <cit> . all three genes showed similar expression patterns in pygo2+/+ and pygo1/pygo <dig> double-mutant kidneys . in addition, these in situ hybridization patterns confirmed the confocal microscopy results, showing a reduced number of tips  per surface area in the pygo1/pygo <dig> double-homozygous mutants.

reduced canonical wnt signaling in pygo1/pygo <dig> mutant mice
the bat-gal transgene reporter of canonical wnt signaling  <cit>  was used to examine changes in wnt signaling in the mutant mice. both pygo2-/- and pygo1/pygo <dig> double-null e <dig>  embryos showed a decrease in canonical wnt signaling . there was, however, tissue-specific variability in the degree of reduction, with the somites, for example, showing strong reduction, while the mutant telencephalon still showed robust wnt signaling. these results suggest that the mammalian pygo genes are significant modulators of canonical wnt signaling in some, but not in all developing systems.

we also examined bat-gal reporter expression in more detail in the developing urogenital system of pygo mutants. the results suggested that the pygo <dig> gene is required for canonical wnt signaling in the nephric duct. both pygo <dig> null and pygo1/pygo <dig> double-null e <dig>  embryos showed an absence of reporter expression in the nephric duct, while control littermates showed strong expression . in pygo1/pygo <dig> double-null mutants, the nephric duct did form, however, and give rise to the ureteric bud outgrowth, which showed reduced but not absent bat-gal reporter expression .

at e <dig> , the pygo <dig> gene appeared to play a major role, and the pygo <dig> gene a minor role, in canonical wnt signaling in the ureteric tree, as measured by bat-gal expression. a negative control kidney, without the bat-gal transgene, showed minimal background x-gal staining , whereas a bat-gal transgenic kidney with at least one wild-type pygo <dig> gene showed strong x-gal staining in the ureteric tree . in contrast, pygo1+/-/pygo2-/- e <dig>  kidneys showed very weak reporter expression , suggesting a significant loss of canonical wnt signaling. homozygous loss of the pygo <dig> gene alone, however, had a small effect on reporter expression . homozygous mutation of both the pygo <dig> and pygo <dig> genes gave a more dramatic reduction of bat-gal expression than loss of pygo <dig> alone .

the pygo <dig> and pygo <dig> genes were also required for bat-gal reporter expression in the paramesonephric  ducts. in pygo2-/- mice, there was a significant loss of reporter expression , and double-homozygous mutants showed loss of x-gal staining in the paramesonephric ducts , whereas pygo1-/-/pygo2+/- and pygo1+/-/pygo2+/- mice showed normal levels of bat-gal expression .

bat-gal reporter analysis of the pygo mutants at a later developmental stage, e <dig> , also identified a significant decrease in canonical wnt signaling in the cortical ureteric branches and renal pelvis of the developing kidney . cortical x-gal staining was seen in the ureteric branches of a pygo1+/-/pygo2+/- kidney , but was completely absent in the cortex of a pygo1+/-/pygo2-/- kidney . bisection revealed a significant loss of x-gal staining cells in the collecting ducts and renal pelvis of the pygo <dig> null kidney compared with control littermates . side by side comparison of pygo1+/+/pygo2+/- , pygo1-/-/pygo2+/- , and pygo1-/-/pygo2-/-  e <dig>  kidneys suggested a significant role for the pygo <dig> gene in canonical wnt signaling in the ureteric tree and its derivatives.

in order to validate and quantify the bat-gal reporter expression changes in the pygo <dig> null and pygo1/pygo <dig> nulls, we performed elisa measurements of transgene specific β-galactosidase levels in e <dig>  kidneys . loss of the pygo <dig> gene  gave greater than 90% reduction in bat-gal expression. loss of pygo <dig> alone  did not result in a significant change. interestingly, however, the pygo1-/-/pygo2+/- showed only 50% of wild-type bat-gal expression, suggesting a minor contribution by pygo <dig> in canonical wnt signaling. although bat-gal expression was decreased in the e <dig>  pygo1-/-/pygo2+/- kidney, confocal analysis of kidneys with this genotype revealed no dilated ureteric tips or significant changes in ureteric tip number per area compared with pygo1-/-/pygo2+/+ kidneys . collectively, these bat-gal reporter results suggest a significant role for the pygo <dig> and pygo <dig> genes in canonical wnt signaling during development of the ureteric tree of the kidney.

interestingly, however, even in wild-type mice the bat-gal reporter showed no expression in the developing metanephric mesenchyme, or metanephric mesenchyme-derived structures, such as renal vesicles, s-shaped bodies, tubules, and glomeruli. this has been reported previously, and was interpreted to indicate the absence of canonical wnt signaling in the metanephric mesenchyme  <cit> . results from other studies, however, argue for the presence of canonical wnt signaling in the metanephric mesenchyme. for example, ureteric bud expression of wnt <dig>  thought to act through canonical wnt signaling, can rescue wnt9b mutants and induce nephrogenesis of the metanephric mesenchyme  <cit> . this suggests that the bat-gal transgene might not accurately report canonical wnt signaling in the metanephric mesenchyme. to address this question, we incubated e <dig>  metanephric mesenchyme in lithium chloride , which activates canonical wnt signaling through inhibition of gsk <dig>  and also functions as an inducer of nephrogenesis in kidney organ culture  <cit> . we observed that licl-treated metanephric mesenchyme did undergo nephrogenesis, as expected, but failed to show bat-gal expression , suggesting that this transgene is not an accurate reporter of canonical wnt signaling in the metanephric mesenchyme of the developing kidney.

microarray analysis of pygo1/pygo <dig> null kidneys
to further examine possible disturbance of gene expression in the pygo1/pygo <dig> mutant kidneys, we used microarrays to perform a global analysis of gene expression changes. whereas the bat-gal transgene reporter monitors the response of one promoter to wnt signaling, microarrays can be used to follow expression changes of all genes, including all known wnt targets. e <dig>  wild-type and pygo1-/-/pygo2-/- kidneys were examined in biological triplicate. in total,  <dig> genes were identified as significantly changed, using a relatively low stringency screen of the data, with a p-value cutoff of < <dig> , and fold change > <dig> . notably, both pygo <dig> and pygo <dig> were identified as downregulated  in the mutant kidneys. other genes with significant decreases in mutant kidneys included cxcl <dig> , slc5a <dig> , and slco1a <dig> . slc5a <dig> is expressed in the proximal tubules of the adult nephron and has been implicated in autosomal recessive renal glucosuria, characterized by loss of glucose uptake by the nephron  <cit> . the organic anion transporter, slco1a <dig>  is also strongly expressed in the tubules of the adult kidney  <cit> . these results suggest that the pygo1/pygo <dig> genes might play a role in nephron maturation and subsequent function.

noteworthy genes upregulated in the pygo1/pygo <dig> null kidney included klk <dig> , klk <dig> , ren <dig> , and timeless . klk <dig> and klk <dig> are members of the kallikrein family of trypsin-like serine proteases. kallikreins have diverse functions in cancer, tissue remodeling, and regulation of blood pressure  <cit> . ren <dig>  a homolog of the endopeptidase renin  <dig>  activates the renin-angiotensin system, increasing blood pressure  <cit> . disruption of the renin-angiotensin system during development results in congenital abnormalities of the ureter and collecting-duct system  <cit> . timeless, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms, and expressed in the branching ureteric tips, has also been shown to regulate ureteric branching morphogenesis  <cit> .

we were interested in the possible altered expression of previously known wnt targets in the pygo1-/-/pygo2-/- mutant kidneys. a list of known wnt targets was compiled from . both pygo <dig> and pygo <dig> probe sets were included as references to illustrate significant down regulation. remarkably, the known wnt target genes showed very few differences in expression between wild-type and mutant kidneys . only the expression of ccnd <dig> encoding cyclin d <dig>  <cit> , and wisp <dig>  <cit>  were significantly changed, with expression level changes of < <dig> -fold in pygo1/pygo <dig> null kidneys. these results indicate an absence of dramatic changes in expression of previously known wnt signaling target genes in the pygo1/pygo <dig> mutant kidneys.

we used quantitative real-time pcr, with independent biological samples, to validate the microarray results. nine genes were tested, and for seven we did observe a significant fold change in the same direction predicted by the microarray results . it is not surprising that two of the nine genes could not be validated, considering the relatively low stringency used in screening the microarray data.

discussion
in drosophila, the pygopus gene is a key mediator of canonical wnt signaling. in one study,  <dig> distinct measures of wnt signaling in pygo mutants were performed, including analysis of leg, wing, and eye imaginal discs. in  <dig> cases there was a significant reduction of wnt signaling and in  <dig> cases a complete block  <cit> . a second study in drosophila examined the effects of pygo mutation on cuticle patterning, midgut constriction, central nervous system, and cardiac development, and concluded that "pygo is an essential component in the wg signal transduction pathway".  <cit> .

given these results in drosophila, the relatively mild phenotypes of mice with targeted pygo <dig>  pygo <dig>  or double pygo1/pygo <dig> mutations were striking. pygo <dig> mutants developed to birth and showed limited abnormalities, while pygo <dig> homozygous mutants were normal and fertile. furthermore, there was no detected synergism in the phenotype of the double pygo1/pygo <dig> mutant, although in several tissues the bat-gal wnt reporter did show more a severe reduction in expression. one possible explanation of these unexpected results is a failure of the gene targeting to eliminate functioning of the pygo <dig> and pygo <dig> genes. the pygopus deletion alleles described in this report, however, are almost certainly functional nulls. in drosophila, it has been shown that the phd domain is absolutely necessary for pygopus function in wg signaling. the phd domain is  <dig> amino acids with seven cysteines and a histidine, predicted to chelate two zinc ions. phd domains are found in diverse proteins, including transcription factors, and have been implicated in chromatin remodeling and protein-protein interactions  <cit> . in drosophila the pygof <dig> allele, with a single missense mutation converting amino acid  <dig> in the phd domain from cysteine to tyrosine, loses wnt signaling function in both embryogenesis and imaginal disc development  <cit> . the pygo1/pygo <dig> mutant alleles made in this report carried deletions of the entire phd domains, as well as most other coding sequences. for the pygo <dig> gene, the coding region for  <dig> of  <dig> total amino acids was deleted, and for the pygo <dig> gene, we deleted coding for  <dig> of  <dig> amino acids. it is therefore very unlikely that the relatively mild phenotypes observed were the result of residual function of the targeted alleles.

we focused our analysis on the developing kidney, in which wnt signaling has been shown to be of critical importance in several stages of nephrogenesis. wnt9b is made by the ureteric bud and induces the metanephric mesenchyme to undergo nephrogenesis  <cit> . downstream of wnt9b is wnt <dig>  <cit> , which is made by the metanephric mesenchyme, and is also required for nephrogenesis  <cit> . in addition, wnt <dig> is produced by the ureteric bud tips and induces gdnf expression in the metanephric mesenchyme  <cit> .

in this report we describe a novel wnt function in kidney development. the bat-gal transgene reporter indicated the presence of canonical wnt signaling in the ureteric bud and its derivatives in the developing kidney. further, in the pygo <dig> mutants this signal was lost, suggesting significant reduction of wnt signaling. in addition, we observed a resulting decrease in ureteric tip density, reduced kidney size and altered morphology of the ureteric tree in mutants, indicating a role for canonical wnt signaling in branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud. while the simplest interpretation is direct wnt signaling to the ureteric bud, it remains possible that the observed abnormalities are the result of indirect effects, with altered wnt signaling to the metanephric mesenchyme then affecting mesenchyme to ureteric bud signaling.

the pygo1/pygo <dig> mutant phenotype of reduced branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud is surprisingly similar to that previously reported for wnt <dig> mutants  <cit> . the underlying mechanisms, however, are likely to be distinct. wnt <dig> is generally thought to act through a noncanonical pathway, , whereas the pygopus genes promote canonical wnt signaling. further, the wnt <dig> mutants showed an altered feedback loop between wnt signaling from the ureteric bud to the mesenchyme and gdnf signaling from the mesenchyme to the bud, whereas in the pygo1/pygo <dig> mutants, we observed disrupted wnt signaling in the ureteric bud.

the pygo1/ <dig> mutants also showed an expansion of the zone of thickened mesenchyme that caps the ureteric bud. nevertheless, the mutant metanephric mesenchyme formed nephrons normally. this was particularly interesting, as wnt9b signaling from the ureteric bud to the metanephric mesenchyme has been shown to induce nephrogenesis via canonical wnt signaling  <cit> .

the results in this report indicate a striking and surprising evolutionary divergence of pygopus function between drosophila and mammals. in drosophila, the pygopus gene is often required for canonical wnt signaling, while in mammals the pygo1/pygo <dig> genes appear to play a smaller role in canonical wnt signaling. the bat-gal transgene reporter of canonical wnt signaling showed reduced but generally not absent signal in pygo1/pygo <dig> mutant embryos, with tissue-specific variation in level of diminution. in addition, the kidneys were not unique in showing surprisingly normal development in pygo1/pygo <dig> mutants. indeed, organogenesis generally proceeded without detectable abnormality, with few exceptions. these results suggest that the proteins encoded by mammalian pygopus genes are often mere modulators of canonical wnt signaling intensity, and not essential components.

the microarray results further support this conclusion. whereas the bat-gal transgene reporter monitors the expression level of only one wnt responsive promoter, the microarray allows the analysis of the activity levels of promoters of all genes. interestingly, the mutant kidneys showed gene-expression profiles surprisingly similar to wild type. some genes did, however, show expression differences, and a high percentage of these differences could be validated by real-time pcr with independent biological samples. assuming that the pygopus genes in mammals are dedicated to canonical wnt signaling, as has been previously shown in drosophila, the genes with expression differences represent candidate wnt targets  in kidney development. we would predict these genes to show greater changes in expression level in a developing kidney with a more complete removal of canonical wnt signaling.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the mammalian pygo <dig> gene is required for normal branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud, with mutants showing dilated tips and reduced numbers of tips. in addition, in pygo <dig> mutants there was an expansion of the zone of metanephric mesenchyme that caps the ureteric buds. nevertheless, nephron formation proceeded remarkably normally, even in pygo1/pygo <dig> double-homozygous mutants. this was surprising considering the importance of the pygopus gene in canonical wnt signaling in drosophila, and the importance of canonical wnt signaling in nephrogenesis. the results argue that the mammalian pygopus genes are, in most developing systems, only quantitative transducers of wnt signaling. previous cell culture studies  <cit>  and the reduced bat-gal transgene reporter expression in the pygo1/pygo <dig> knockout mice described in this report, do confirm an evolutionarily conserved function in canonical wnt signaling. in mammals, however, the phenotypic effects of pygopus mutation are much milder than in drosophila. the degree of importance of the pyg1/ <dig> genes in wnt signaling was context-dependent, but in general, mammalian organogenesis remained intact in pygopus mutants. perhaps the simplest explanation is that in mammals, other genes show partial functional redundancy with the two pygopus genes. the β-catenin transcription-factor complex includes a large and growing number of proteins , some of which may share the nuclear localization and/or transcription activation functions of pygo1/pygo <dig> in mammals. the identities and roles of these pygopus redundant genes remain to be determined.
