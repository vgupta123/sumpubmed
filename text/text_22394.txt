BACKGROUND
environmental bacteria are in perpetual war against several competitors, and thus require weapons to conquer new territory. the type  <dig> secretion system  of gram-negative bacteria is an effector translocation apparatus resembling an inverted bacteriophage puncturing device  <cit> . it is involved in a broad variety of functions, including antibacterial activity  <cit>  and bacterial communication  <cit> . for example, proteus mirabilis uses the killing activity of t6ss for self-recognition: this t6ss seems to be activated when opposing p. mirabilis swarms meet. the result of its action is a visible boundary called the dienes line  <cit> .

the t6ss machinery comprises at least  <dig> proteins, the core components, and sometimes, additional proteins  <cit> . some of the core component proteins can affect systems other than t6ss. hcp proteins, extracellular components of this secretion machinery, are released into the medium, and therefore may serve as markers of a functional t6ss apparatus  <cit> . silverman and colleagues demonstrated that p. aeruginosa hcp are not only structural proteins but also play a crucial role as chaperone and receptor for t6ss effectors. various hcp proteins transport their own effectors and this effector selection by hcp seems to be specific  <cit> .

the diversity of t6ss regulation reflects the vast array of its functions. the p. aeruginosa h1-t6ss gene cluster exhibits posttranscriptional regulation involving two sensor kinases, rets and lads  <cit> . high concentrations of synthetic c-di-gmp have negative effects on sensor kinase rets, leading to p. aeruginosa h1-t6ss being turned on  <cit> . it is likely that a similar regulatory pathway controls the expression of p. protegens pf- <dig> and p. syringae pv. syringae t6ss gene clusters  <cit> . however, t6ss regulation involves systems that regulate other genes suggesting regulatory cross-talk between t6ss and other virulence factors.

environmental bacteria are often surrounded by an extracellular matrix, forming a protective capsule called the glycocalyx  <cit> . this extracellular matrix is generally composed of bacterial exopolysaccharides . eps are involved in a variety of functions, including microcolony formation, protection against bacteriophages and mucoid phenotypes. the mucoid phenotype of pseudomonas sp. is believed to be a global adaptive stress response to adverse environmental conditions  <cit> . it is characterized by overproduction of eps alginate leading to shiny, raised and opaque colonies. the mucoid phenotype is a major factor contributing to p. aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis  patients  <cit>  but is unstable in vitro  <cit> . some p. aeruginosa cf isolates acquire a mucoid phenotype through mutation of the anti-sigma factor muca, a negative regulatory factor that sequesters algu, a positive regulator of alginate production  <cit> . a proteomic study by rao and coworkers found that mucoid p. aeruginosa strains do not express t6ss genes  <cit> . unlike p. aeruginosa, some vibrio cholerae strains are mucoid and have an active t6ss  <cit> . some environmental p. fluorescens strains produce alginate or neutral and amino sugars which give a mucoid phenotype  <cit> . the p. fluorescens mucoid phenotype, like that in p. aeruginosa, was reported to be unstable  <cit> . the mucoid phenotype can occur following mutation of the negative regulator of the alginate biosynthetic operon, muc  <cit> . we previously characterized the strain mfe <dig>  a mucoid environmental p. fluorescens isolate. it constitutively secretes two characteristic t6ss proteins at 28°c: hcp <dig> and hcp <dig>  it also exerts antibacterial activity during contact on a solid surface with competitive bacteria; this activity is associated with hcp <dig>  <cit> . the aim of this work was to study the role of hcp <dig> and the link between t6ss and the mucoid phenotype of mfe <dig> 

RESULTS
some mucoid p. fluorescens strains secrete hcp abundantly
the phenotypes of four p. fluorescens strains were observed after growth on lb agar plates at 28°c. environmental strains mfe <dig>  <cit>  and mfe <dig>  had a stable shiny aspect, characteristic of mucoid phenotypes at 28°c. skin strain mfp <dig>  <cit>  and clinical strain mfn <dig>  <cit>  did not have a mucoid phenotype at this temperature .figure  <dig>

strains. a: mucoidy was assessed on lb agar at 28°c. +: mucoid, −: non mucoid. b: mucoidy at 28°c or 37°c of mfe <dig>  +: mucoid, −: non mucoid. the images shown are representative of three assays. c: concentrated supernatants of cultures in late exponential growth phase, grown at 28°c or 37°c, were analysed by sds-page  and coomassie staining. bands  with an approximate molecular mass of  <dig> kda were observed in mfe <dig> and mfe <dig> supernatants at 28°c. mass spectrometry identified these major supernatant proteins as hcp proteins.



muca is a negative regulator of the mucoid phenotype  <cit>  in pseudomonas species. we introduced the muca gene of the pseudomonas protegens strain pf- <dig>   <cit>  into mfe <dig>  the expression of muca did not switch-off mucoidy at 28°c, suggesting that the mucoid phenotype of mfe <dig> is not due to a mutation of the muca gene or is muca independent . scanlan and buckling showed that the environmental p. fluorescens strain sbw <dig> has an unstable mucoid phenotype; although the genetic mechanisms of this phenotype remain unknown, they do not include mutations at many of the loci commonly reported to be involved in mucoid conversion, including muca and algu. they also demonstrated that lytic phage exerts a selection pressure by selecting the mucoid phenotype  <cit> .

we prepared supernatants of cultures of mucoid p. fluorescens strains mfe <dig> and mfe <dig> and found that these strains secreted large amounts of proteins identified as hcp by mass spectroscopy  . the spot for the protein secreted by mfe <dig> matched significantly with gi:  <dig>  with a score of  <dig> for a score threshold of  <dig>  the spot for the protein secreted by mfe <dig> spot matched significantly with gi: <dig>  with a score of  <dig> for a score threshold of  <dig>  the non-mucoid p. fluorescens strains mfp <dig> and mfn <dig> did not secrete detectable amounts of hcp proteins into the extracellular medium.

the optimal growth temperature of mfe <dig> is 28°c but it can grow at 37°c. clearly visible at 28°c, the mucoid phenotype and hcp secretion were both switched off at 37°c, suggesting a common regulation of these two phenotypes .

unterweger and colleagues observed a correlation between the mucoid phenotype and hcp secretion in v. cholerae smooth strains  <cit> . sigma- <dig> controls t6ss genes transcription, so they introduced vash, encoding a sigma- <dig> activator protein, into rough  v. cholera strains impaired in hcp secretion: the expression of vash restored the mucoid phenotype, but not the hcp secretion. however, vash can activate transcription of genes other than t6ss genes via sigma- <dig>  <cit>  suggesting that the correlation between mucoidy and t6ss in v. cholerae may be due to a common regulation system.

hcp <dig> of p. fluorescens mfe <dig> is involved in mucoid phenotype
we constructed hcp mutants, and found that the hcp <dig> mutation  lead to the loss of mucoidy at 28°c whereas the hcp <dig> mutation  did not affect the mucoid phenotype . the introduction of a plasmid carrying the hcp <dig> gene into mfe01∆hcp <dig>  restored the wild-type phenotype, suggesting a direct link between hcp <dig> expression and mucoidy. we analysed and compared the extracellular matrices  of mfe <dig> and mfe01∆hcp <dig>  the mucoid phenotype is a consequence of exopolysaccharide  accumulation  <cit> , so we determined ecm sugar composition by gas–liquid chromatography . no significant difference between mfe <dig> and mfe01∆hcp <dig> was observed concerning the proportion of characteristic sugars of the pseudomonas eps . thus, mfe01∆hcp <dig> is able to secrete an eps similar to that produced by mfe <dig>  nevertheless, the mfe <dig> ecm contained twice as much eps as the mfe01∆hcp <dig> ecm suggesting that the loss of the mucoid phenotype was a consequence of less eps accumulation . in pseudomonas aeruginosa, biofilm formation and t6ss expression are negatively regulated by the sensor rets and rets mutants produce a hyperbiofilm phenotype  <cit> . biofilm formation by mfe <dig> and mutants was then assayed. the moderate biofilm biovolume was not significantly different between mfe <dig> and mfe01∆hcp <dig> or mfe01∆hcp <dig> mutants . these findings indicate that mucoid phenotype and biofilm formation are not co-regulated by t6ss in mfe <dig> figure  <dig>

ecm protein fractions from supernatants of mfe <dig>  mfe01∆hcp <dig> and mfe01∆hcp1+hcp <dig> were studied by sds-page . proteins of approximate molecular mass of  <dig> kda were present in ecm extracts from mfe <dig> and mfe01∆hcp1+hcp <dig> but not in mfe01∆hcp <dig>  ms identified these  <dig> kda proteins as flagellin proteins: they matched significantly with flagellin from pseudomonas moraviensis  with a score of  <dig> for a score threshold of  <dig>  thus, the mucoid phenotype appears to involve the accumulation of both eps and flagellin in ecm, which are perturbed by hcp <dig> deletion. this was unexpected because the literature generally reports an inverse cross-talk between the mucoid phenotype and flagellar assembly. for example, the alternative sigma factor, σ <dig> , is a positive regulator of alginate biosynthesis and a negative regulator of flagellum biosynthesis  <cit> .figure  <dig>

mutations on flagellin secretion into the extracellular matrix and on motility. a: protein fractions from the ecm of mfe <dig>  mfe01Δhcp <dig> and mfe01Δhcp1+hcp <dig> were analysed by sds-page and coomassie staining. bands with approximate molecular mass ≈  <dig> kda, indicated by the arrows, were observed at the growth temperature of 28°c and were identified as flagellin proteins by maldi-tof . molecular weight markers are indicated. b: swimming assay on lb in  <dig> % agar at 28°c. mfe <dig>  mfe01Δhcp <dig> and mfe01Δhcp1+hcp <dig> were motile but mfe01Δhcp <dig> and mfe01Δhcp1+ ppsv <dig>  were non motile .



p. fluorescens mfe <dig> hcp <dig> is involved in motility
we examined motility of our various strains to elucidate the relation between flagellin accumulation in the ecm and flagellum functionality. mfe <dig>  mfe01∆hcp <dig>  mfe01∆hcp <dig>  mfe01Δhcp1+ppsv <dig>  and mfe01∆hcp1+hcp <dig> were assayed for swimming; this confirmed that mfe01∆hcp <dig> had lost motility that was restored by hcp <dig> introduction in trans. the restoration of wild-type phenotype in mfe01∆hcp1+hcp <dig> is inconsistent with a possible polar effect of the hcp <dig> deletion .

the type  <dig> secretion system is related to the flagellum  <cit> , but little is known about the relation between t6ss and the flagellar regulon. the icmf of vibrio cholerae, a t6ss protein, is involved in motility  <cit> . icmf is an inner-membrane protein of the t6ss found in numerous pathogens, and has been implicated in intracellular multiplication inside host cells  <cit> . in an avian pathogenic e. coli, icmf mutation impaired motility  <cit> ; the authors indicate that this contrasts with other mutants in t6ss genes, notably clpv and hcp, which had no motility defects. their findings suggest that the motility defect of the icmf mutant was not due to a general defect of motility because of a non-functional t6ss. icmf was somehow involved in flagellar regulation. the restoration of the motility of mfe01∆hcp <dig> by hcp <dig> introduction in trans implies that the function of t6ss associated to hcp <dig> expression is directly involved in motility in this strain.

the hcp <dig> mutant of p. fluorescens mfe <dig> retains virulence toward competitor bacteria
the hcp concentration was slightly lower in the supernatant of mfe01∆hcp <dig> than that of the wild-type mfe <dig> at 28°c . this is consistent with our previous observations  <cit> : most of the hcp secreted by mfe <dig> is produced from the expression of the hcp <dig> gene. we have also demonstrated that mfe <dig> has a killing activity against various gram-negative bacteria on solid medium. mfe01Δhcp <dig> reduced prey cell populations, but significantly less than mfe <dig> indicating that hcp <dig> contributes to the killing activity, and that another factor is also involved. to determine whether hcp <dig> could be this other factor, we co-cultured mutant mfe01Δhcp <dig> and the prey mfn <dig> on a filter on solid media for 4h at 28°c. there was no significant difference of the mfn <dig> population between the co-culture with wild-type mfe <dig> and the co-culture with mfe01∆hcp <dig> . thus, hcp <dig> was not the key factor in this antibacterial activity even if it contributed to killing. whereas, the mfe01∆hcp <dig> mutant had significantly less antibacterial activity than mfe <dig> and mfe01∆hcp <dig>  the double mutant, mfe01∆hcp1∆hcp <dig>  was even less bactericidal than mfe01∆hcp <dig> but nevertheless reduced the mfn <dig> population. another system independent of hcp <dig> and hcp <dig> seems to be involved in killing activity.figure  <dig>

p. fluorescens mfe <dig> inhibits the motility of p. fluorescens strain mfn1032
the killing activity mediated by t6ss during swarming in p. mirabilis involves self-recognition , and we therefore studied the behaviour of mfe <dig> in conditions permitting its motility  <cit> . in swimming conditions , p. fluorescens mfn <dig> was spotted into the centre of a ring formed by mfe <dig> or its mutants . mfe <dig>  mfe01∆hcp1+hcp <dig> and mfe01∆hcp <dig> inhibited mfn <dig> motility, but swimming mfn <dig> spread through the mfe01∆hcp <dig> and, mfe01∆hcp1+ppsv <dig> mutants . the hcp <dig> mutation thus abolished mfe <dig> confining mfn <dig>  introduction of the native hcp <dig> gene in trans restored the inhibitory activity on mfn <dig> swimming. thus, in these swimming conditions, hcp <dig> expression seems required for p. fluorescens mfe <dig> to control the swimming of p. fluorescens mfn <dig>  in these conditions, mfe01∆hcp <dig> lacked motility whereas mfe <dig> was motile . the confinement of mfn <dig> could be simply due to the formation of a physical barrier by the motile mfe <dig> whereas non-motile mfe01∆hcp <dig> could not form this barrier.figure  <dig> 
effects of
p. fluorescens
mfe <dig> and its mutants on competitive bacteria. a: schematic drawing of the assay: p. fluorescens mfn <dig> was inoculated into the centre of a ring formed by mfe <dig> or a mutant on lb medium in  <dig> % agar. on this medium mfn <dig> and me <dig> can swim. b: swimming of mfn <dig> in competition with mfe <dig> or mutants. results after incubation at 28°c,  <dig> h. the images shown are representative of three assays. c: co-cultures were performed on swarming medium  at 28°c, 24h. on this medium mfn <dig> can swarm but me <dig> cannot. prey cells  were or were not mixed with p. fluorescens mfe <dig> or its derivatives at ratio 1: <dig>  the images shown are representative of three assays. d: quantitative black histograms represent survival of mfn <dig> and white squares the mfn <dig> swarm diameter . * indicates a significant difference of the mfn <dig> cfu  relative to the mfn1032/mfe <dig> assay. ns: no significant difference.



so we therefore conducted co-cultures overnight on  <dig> % lb agar, conditions allowing the swarming of mfn <dig>  on these plates, mfe <dig> and mutants were unable to swarm because mfe <dig> lacks surfactants essential for p. fluorescens swarming  <cit> . mfe <dig> and mfe01∆hcp <dig> clearly inhibited mfn <dig> swarming, whereas mfe01∆hcp <dig> and mfe01∆hcp1∆hcp <dig> had much less effect on mfn <dig> swarming . this indicates that the inhibition of motility observed was not due to mfe <dig> or its derivatives forming a physical barrier. also, diameter of the mfn <dig> swarming was reduced, albeit to a lesser extent, by the double mutant mfe01∆hcp1∆hcp <dig> providing further evidence for another unidentified inhibitory factor. these experiments are uninformative about whether the decrease in swarming diameter is due to a killing activity or an immobilization activity.

we consequently assayed the bactericidal activity of mfe <dig> and its mutants by counting mfn <dig> cells in each swarming condition . the mfn <dig> population underwent 5-logs drops after co-culture with wild-type mfe <dig>  co-culture with mfe01∆hcp <dig> and mfe01∆hcp <dig> did not significantly decrease the mfn <dig> population. we assumed that when co-cultured with mfe01∆hcp <dig>  mfn <dig> cells could swarm and thereby escape from the killing activity mediated by hcp <dig>  which requires close contact. when in co-culture with mfe01∆hcp <dig>  mfn <dig> could not be able to escape but the killing activity is abolished by hcp <dig> mutation. in antibacterial activity assays on solid media , the mfn <dig> cells were immobilized on a filter, and therefore unable to escape the killing activity of the hcp <dig> mutant.

these results suggest that mfe <dig> needs hcp <dig> and hcp <dig> to kill mfn <dig> in conditions of motility: hcp <dig> could reduce the motility of prey cells and thereby facilitate killing by hcp <dig> 

phenotypes assigned to hcp <dig> and hcp <dig> are associated to a t6ss
analysis of mfe <dig> draft genome is under way. preliminary results indicated that this genome contains only one t6ss cluster exhibiting all core component genes but hcp genes. the two hcp genes, hcp <dig> and hcp <dig>  are separately located outside this cluster and are associated with vgrg genes. into this unique t6ss we identified a gene coding for a putative protein corresponding to a protein member of evpb/vc_a <dig> family . this putative protein matched with the wp_ <dig>  sequence . these proteins are described as t6ss needle sheath proteins tssc and are essential components of this system. mfe01∆tssc, a mutant disrupted in this t6ss core component gene, was non motile in swimming conditions and non-mucoid at 28°c as well as mfe01∆hcp <dig>  whereas mfe01∆hcp <dig> conserved the wild type phenotype . during co-culture on lbg containing x-gal at 28°c with e.coli containing puc <dig> , mfe01∆hcp <dig> and mfe01∆tssc allowed e.colipuc <dig> growth  whereas mfe01∆hcp <dig> and mfe <dig> inhibited e.colipuc <dig> growth  . me01∆tssc phenotype seems similar to a patchwork of mfe01∆hcp <dig> and mfe01∆hcp <dig> phenotypes. these results provide a strong confirmation of hcp <dig> and hcp <dig> involvement in a t6ss.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we further illustrate the importance and versatility of the t6ss in bacterial adaptation and fitness. we demonstrated cooperation between two different hcp proteins in bacterial competition. the observations indicate that t6ss associated with hcp <dig> secretion has pleiotropic effects on p. fluorescens mfe01: it affects mucoidy, motility and competitor inhibition in motility conditions. the relationships between t6ss and flagellin and between t6ss and mucoidy have not yet been fully elucidated. nevertheless, we describe some of the mechanisms associated with mfe <dig> motility and inhibition of prey cell motility. this suggests that some effectors, that are used to inhibit competitor motility, could be accumulated in mfe01∆hcp <dig>  in absence of hcp <dig>  and consequently might inhibit the mutant’s own motility. analysis of mfe <dig> draft genome is under way. numerous mutants should be constructed to analyse function of unknown putative genes surrounding these hcp genes to ensure an informative genomic annotation and to explain how this t6ss could impact mucoidy and motility.
