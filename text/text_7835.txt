BACKGROUND
small rnas, including small interfering rnas  and micrornas , are involved in both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional control pathways within nearly every crucial gene cascade in eukaryotic cells
 <cit> . mirnas are single-stranded non-coding rnas with sizes most often ranging from 20– <dig> nucleotides 
 <cit> . mirna loci are transcribed by rna polymerase ii into primary mirna transcripts  that are processed by nuclear rnase iii-like enzymes, such as dicer and drosha in animals
 <cit>  and dicer-like proteins  in plants
 <cit> . after being transported to the cytoplasm, mirnas are incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex  to exert their regulatory functions through cleavage or translation inhibition based on the nearly complementary binding of an mrna target
 <cit> . the examination of mirnas from various plant species has revealed their possible involvement in organ development, cell differentiation, hormone signaling, biotic and abiotic stress responses, genome maintenance and integrity, and diverse physiological processes
 <cit> .

sequencing of small rnas is a starting point for understanding their number, diversity, expression and possible roles in plants. published reports as well as publicly accessible mirna datasets from different plant species suggest that plant mirnas are highly complex and abundant. as of june  <dig>  release  <dig>  of the mirbase database contained  <dig>  plant mirna entries, including  <dig> from arabidopsis,  <dig> from rice,  <dig> from maize,  <dig> from sorghum,  <dig> from barley, and  <dig> from populous 
 <cit> . sequencing of small rna populations in plants has established the existence of  <dig> highly conserved mirna families with abundant expression, which overwhelmingly regulate the expression of transcription factors that are critical for development or stress responses. recently developed deep sequencing technologies are uncovering an increasing number of lineage-specific or species-specific mirnas exhibiting low or tissue-specific expression, which target diverse genes with specialized functions. for example, the brassicaceae family-specific mir <dig> regulates the expression of agamous-like  <dig>  which plays a role in controlling stomatal density and development in leaves
 <cit> . therefore, the identification of mirnas in diverse species has been a major focus in recent years.

based on mirna discovery, the mirnas putatively related to certain tissues development have been identified by deep sequencing technologies. for example, cotton mirnas show a trend of repression during ovule and fiber development, and this rapid and dynamic change may contribute to ovule and fiber development in allotetraploid cotton
 <cit> . a diverse set of mirnas and mirna-like small rnas have been identified from developing rice grains, some of which are differentially expressed during seed development
 <cit> . sequencing of srna populations from soybean seeds and vegetative tissues has also revealed tissue-preferential expression for certain mirnas
 <cit> . interestingly, the recently evolved mir <dig> displays differences in spatial expression between arabidopsis thaliana and arabidopsis arenosa and in their allotetraploids
 <cit> . these data suggest that species-specific mirnas and the spatio-temporal regulation of conserved mirnas play important roles in shaping morphological and developmental variation among related species during evolution
 <cit> .

mirna binding to complementary sequences in target mrnas regulates eukaryotic gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through mrna degradation or translational repression
 <cit> . most plant mirnas induce the degradation of their mrna targets through precisely cleaving the target sequence between the tenth and eleventh nt from the 5′ end of the mirna binding site
 <cit> . with the emergence of high-throughput sequencing technologies, degradome analysis or pare , which can globally collect 3′ fragments of mrna targets, is the current choice for validating mirna targets that are cleaved
 <cit> . using this method, a large number of target genes have been successfully identified in arabidopsis
 <cit> , rice
 <cit> , soybean
 <cit>  and wheat
 <cit> . these validated targets include transcription factors that play key roles in development and genes involved in a variety of other physiological processes. in addition, mirna-guided cleavage initiates the entry of primary transcripts into the phase-sirna biogenesis pathway. for example, arabidopsis thaliana ta-sirnas form from primary transcripts that are initially targeted and cleaved by the ago1–mir <dig> , ago1–mir <dig>  or ago7–mir <dig>  complex
 <cit> . the tomato 22 nt mir <dig> triggers the formation of phase-sirna from its target aca <dig> gene and may function as a novel layer of a molecular mechanism underlying tomato reproductive growth
 <cit> .

hexaploid wheat, triticum aestivum l.  is one of the most widely cultivated crops globally due to its high yield and nutritional and processing qualities, providing 20% of the calories consumed by humans . previous studies attempted to identify mirnas associated with development and stress response in wheat by sequencing small rna population
 <cit>  or by computational strategies
 <cit> . for example, our group and wei et al. identified  <dig> and  <dig> wheat mirna families by sequencing pooled rnas from leaves, stems, roots and spikes
 <cit> . li et al. also constructed small rna and degradome libraries leading to identification of  <dig> mirnas and their targets from wheat seedlings
 <cit> . from developing grains, around  <dig> mirnas putatively associated with grain development were identified
 <cit> . only a small scale of mirnas was determined spactial-temporal expression pattern along wheat development, and majority of detected mirnas were preferentially expressed in certain tissues. however, no whole genome scale mirna identification and expression comparison among multiple tissues types or developmental stages has been done. in this study, we selected  <dig> tissues throughout the wheat growth to discover wheat mirnas in whole genome scale. moreover, previous study on wheat mirnas prediction relied on extremely limited wheat genome sequences, and given the larger genome size of wheat, there may be additional mirnas that have not been identified. recently, based on the whole-genome shotgun strategy, draft genomes for bread wheat
 <cit> , its a-genome progenitor triticum urartu 
 <cit>  and its d-genome progenitor aegilops tauschii 
 <cit>  have been reported. furthermore, next-generation sequencing data of flow-sorted individual chromosome arms of wheat were also partly available, provided by international wheat genome sequencing consortium  . indeed, a recent study predicted mirnas on wheat chromosome 1al, 6b and 5d
 <cit> . in this study, in order to discover wheat mirnas in whole genome scale by experimental approach, we identified  <dig> mirnas from multiple wheat tissues of different developmental stages based on all of the genome sequences available.

hexaploid wheat is one of the most widely cultivated crops globally due to its high yield and nutritional and processing qualities, providing 20% of the calories consumed by humans . despite its agricultural importance of wheat grains, research on the molecular basis of development of wheat grains is limited. some topics that have been studied include expression profiles of metabolic proteins in endosperm
 <cit>  and of mrna in whole grain
 <cit> . the role of mirnas during grain development is still unknown, and identification of grain development associated mirnas could accelerate the progress of wheat improvement and potentially increase its production. in this study, we further screened the mirnas that were preferentially expressed in wheat grains, which might play important roles in grain development.

RESULTS
distribution of small rna populations in multiple wheat tissues of different developmental stages
given the increasingly diverse and significant roles being uncovered for endogenous small rnas in plant development and stress responses, we first determined the size and composition of the small rna populations in various wheat tissues of different developmental stages. a total of  <dig> sequencing libraries were constructed using small rnas extracted from dry grains , germinating seed embryos , seedling shoots , seedling leaves , seedling roots , stems in the jointing stage , 0–5 mm young spikes , 10–15 mm young spikes , flag leaves , developing grain of 8 days after pollination  and 15 days after pollination  in the chinese spring wheat cultivar. solexa high-throughput sequencing generated a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides in length from these libraries . this analysis identified  <dig> , <dig> unique sequence tags, of which  <dig> % were singletons, indicating that wheat genome expressed a highly diverse and complex small rna population.

* <dig> tissues used to construct libraries in this study. dg: dry grain, gse: embryo of germinating seed, sh: shoot, sl: seedling leaf, sr: seedling root, sj: stem in jointing stage, ys5: 0-5 mm young spike, ys15: 10-15 mm young spike, fl: flag leaf, gra8: grains of 8 days after pollination, gra15: grains of 15 days after pollination.

we assessed the size distribution of the sequences based on both their total abundances and distinct signatures . regarding the proportion of distinct sequences of each size, which might represent the extent of the complexity of the wheat small rna population, we found that 24 nt signatures were prevalent in all of the libraries, whereas 21 nt signatures were less abundant . these results indicated that 24 nt srnas, the majority of which were associated with repeats and transposons, exhibited the highest sequence diversity, consistent with widespread origins of srnas within wheat genomes. the overall size distribution patterns of the unique 24 nt srnas from the  <dig> libraries showed striking differences, in that the proportion of distinct 24 nt signatures ranged from  <dig> % in seedling roots to  <dig> % in stems in the jointing stage. interestingly, the 10 ~ 15 mm young spikes displayed a large set of distinct 21 nt srnas  as compared to the other tissues. in terms of total abundance, approximately 85% of the reads were 20-24 nt in length, with  <dig> and 24 nt representing the major size classes, consistent with being products of cleavage by dcl enzymes . the most abundant size of the wheat small rnas was  <dig> nt, followed by  <dig> and 22 nt. gra <dig> showed significantly higher 24 nt small rna abundance  than average  of all tissues. it was worth noting that dry grain, germinating seed embryos, and  <dig> and  <dig> dap grain significantly produced more 22 nt than 21 nt srnas , whereas in other tissues 21 nt srna abundance was significantly higher than 22 nt  . such enrichment of 22 nt srnas in grains has been previously observed in maize
 <cit>  and soybean
 <cit>  but not in rice
 <cit> .

genome-wide discovery of wheat mirnas
around  <dig> wheat mirnas putatively associated with development and stress response have been identified by sequencing small rna population
 <cit>  . firstly, we confirmed the presence of a total of  <dig> known mirnas from  <dig> families sharing the exactly same sequences with reported wheat mirnas in our small rna sequencing dataset . in order to find novel variants of known mirnas, we searched small rnas with  <dig> or  <dig> mismatches to known mirnas in our small rna sequencing data libraries by use of homolog analysis, which leading to  <dig> novel variants belonging to known mirna families .

next, we mapped the rest of small rnas to wheat genome for the identification of novel wheat mirnas which showed low homology to known mirnas, and we found that a total of  <dig> , <dig> small rna sequences can be perfectly matched to wheat genome. after removing the small rnas matching to repeat, rrna and trna, the remaining  <dig> , <dig> small rnas were subjected to mirna identification. then, we relied on wheat est sequences and genome sequences available  as mirna surrounding sequences in hairpin structure prediction. finally, sequencing data from  <dig> libraries supported the identification of  <dig> wheat novel mirnas from  <dig> families . regarding the unique counts of mirnas, we found the predominance of 21 nt  and 24 nt  , which indicated their origins from wheat genome. when we calculated the abundance of mirnas, we found that 24 nt mirnas only accounted for  <dig> % of the total abundance, while approximately  <dig> % of the mirnas were  <dig>   <dig> or 22 nt in length , which indicates that a wide range of 24 nt mirnas originating from diverse loci are expressed at low abundance. the 24 nt long mirnas has been demonstrated to direct dna methylation at loci from which they are produced as well as in trans at their target genes and play roles in gene regulation in rice
 <cit> . we further compared the expression patterns of the  <dig> and 22 nt mirnas across various tissues, and interestingly, the 22 nt mirnas showed markedly higher expression levels in seed tissues, including dry grains, germinating seed embryos, and grains  <dig> and 15 days after pollination, which was quite contrary to the expression pattern of the 21 nt mirnas . next, we analyzed the distribution of the 5′ end nucleotides of the mirnas. the results revealed that the 24 nt mirnas showed a strong bias for a as the 5′ terminal nucleotide , consistent with what is observed in long mirnas in rice
 <cit> , whereas the 21 nt mirnas exhibited a higher proportion of 5′ ends beginning with u and then a . these findings provided evidence that the 21 nt and 24 nt mirnas were generated by different dcls and that they were specifically sorted into different ago clade proteins based on hierarchy rules
 <cit> .

identification of wheat-specific mirnas and wheat-specific variants for conserved mirnas
to date, highly and moderately conserved mirnas have been identified from eudicots to basal plants
 <cit> . in this study, we found that all  <dig> known highly conserved mirna families were detected in our dataset. moreover, we also identified  <dig> wheat-specific variants from  <dig> highly conserved mirna families, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> families . these findings indicated that different members of the same mirna family might evolve at different rates within the same plant species, or most likely associated with the polyploid nature of wheat. to screen the wheat specific mirnas, we explored the presence of  <dig> novel wheat mirnas across arabidopsis, soybean, rice, maize, sorghum, barley and brachypodium. among them,  <dig> were wheat-specific, while orthologs were found for the remainder in other species . we also found  <dig> monocot specific mirnas including tae-mir3014b and tae-mir <dig> which were conserved among all of the monocots we examined. we analyzed the origin of wheat mirnas including known and novel mirnas along the grass evolution, and the results indicated that  <dig> mirnas were shared by all monocots indicating their origin from ancient ancestors and  <dig> mirnas diverged and retained in wheat, barley, rice and brachypodium after divergence of maize and sorghum from rice. a total of  <dig> wheat mirnas were shared with barley but loss in brachypodium and rice . these results indicated that a large number of wheat mirnas were born at divergence of barley and wheat from rice.

transcriptome-wide identification of mirna targets in wheat through degradome sequencing
to gain insight into the functions of known and novel mirnas in wheat, mirna target genes were identified through a degradome sequencing approach. four libraries, prepared from germinating seeds, seedling leaves, seedling roots and grains collected  <dig> dap were constructed for degradome sequencing, and more than 10 m high quality reads were obtained from each library. because 24 nt mirnas mainly mediate dna methylation, only the identified mirnas with sizes of 20–23 nt were subjected to further target gene analysis in this study.

based on degradome sequencing, a total of  <dig> potential targets were identified for  <dig> wheat mirna families . the number of predicted targets per mirna  was higher in wheat as compared to arabidopsis 
 <cit>  and rice 
 <cit> , suggesting the existence of additional paralogous and homoeologous genes in this hexaploid species. among these target genes,  <dig> % and  <dig> % were regulated by mirnas at the orf and 3′ utr, respectively, and only  <dig> % of the genes were targeted in the 5′ utr. notably, the cleavage analyses revealed a total of  <dig> target transcripts that were targeted by more than two distinct mirnas. for instance, the unigene encoding atp-sulfurylase  <dig> was targeted by mir <dig> within the coding region and by ta-mir <dig>  ta-mir <dig> and tae-mir <dig> in the 3′ utr. although atp-sulfurylase is similarly targeted by mir <dig> within its coding region in rice, we did not find similar mirnas targeting its 3′ utr, indicating mir <dig> combined with other mirnas can target atp-sulfurylase in a potential wheat-specific pathway.

to gain a better understanding of the functional roles of the predicted mirna target genes in wheat, we searched for enrichment in the mapman molecular function and biological process categories
 <cit> . we found that the identified target genes involved in a wide spectrum of regulatory functions and selected biological processes including rna metabolism, protein metabolism, hormone metabolism, signaling, development, and transport . under the category of protein metabolism, a total of 31% and 34% of the mirna target genes were involved in protein degradation and synthesis, respectively. for rna metabolism, the genes targeted by mirnas showed a strong enrichment for transcription factor or transcription regulator activity .

it was well established that conserved mirnas target conserved homologous genes in diverse plant species. in this study,  <dig> potential target genes for  <dig> highly or moderately conserved mirnas were identified. a total of  <dig> unigenes encoding proteins such as squamosa promoter-binding-like protein, auxin response factors, nac transcription factors, and mads-box transcription factors were found to be conserved targets regulated by highly conserved mirnas in wheat. we also identified  <dig> non-conserved target unigenes for  <dig> highly or moderately conserved mirnas . for instance, in addition to auxin response factors, mir <dig> was found to target two unigenes encoding fizzy-related 2-like proteins. similarly, wheat mir <dig> was observed to target three unigenes encoding proline-, glutamic acid- and leucine-rich proteins, in addition to the well-conserved myb family. based on the degradome sequencing, proline-, glutamic acid- and leucine-rich proteins gene  was found to be cleaved mainly at the position of 10th and 11th nucleotide of mir <dig> binding site in two different degradome libraries including gse and sr . these findings suggest that at least some conserved mirnas are regulating nonconserved targets in addition to the well-documented conserved targets. we employed a gene-specific 5′-rapid amplification of cdna ends  assay to isolate cleavage remnants for  <dig> target genes, including  <dig> spl genes for mir <dig>   <dig> arf gene for mir <dig>   <dig> nac genes for mir <dig>   <dig> homeobox-leucine zipper genes for mir <dig>   <dig> genes encoding nuclear transcription factor y subunit a proteins for mir <dig>   <dig> scarecrow-like protein gene for mir <dig> and  <dig> ap <dig> gene for mir <dig>  and  <dig> gene encoding a c3hc <dig> type zinc finger protein that was regulated by mir <dig> in wheat. the results of this analysis indicated that the cleavage sites for all  <dig> of these genes were consistent with the degradome sequencing results . thus, we provide degradome sequencing and 5′-race evidence demonstrating that deeply conserved mirnas can regulate both conserved and non-conserved targets.

in addition, we focused on the target of wheat-specific mirnas, and identified  <dig> targets for  <dig> wheat-specific mirnas, which encoded proteins involved a diverse range of processes, including metabolism, development and other physiological processes . to validate the cleavage of these targets,  <dig> target genes were examined via 5′-race. however, none of them were validated as being cleaved at the mirna binding site. the explanation might be that 1) some species-specific mirnas lack target genes; 2) the targets of some species-specific mirnas are expressed at a very low level or in a tissue-specific manner, and they cannot be identified by degradome sequencing; 3) many species-specific mirnas repress the translation of their target genes, which therefore cannot be determined through degradome sequencing or 5′ race methods, which fail to clone the target in the absence of detectable slicing; 4) some mirnas identified based on small rna sequencing and prediction of precursor hairpin structure might not be real ones. more evidences are needed to confirm. for example, are they dcl <dig> dependent? finally, we identified  <dig> targets for  <dig> wheat-barley linage specific mirnas through degradome sequencing . we validated the cleavage of  <dig> target genes for  <dig> wheat-barley-specific mirnas through 5′-race. among these genes, two unigenes encoding an unknown protein and a disease resistance rpm1-like protein were identified as targets of mir2009a. mir3134a cleaved two genes, encoding respiratory burst oxidase homolog proteins h and j. mir3043a targeted unigene encoding disease resistance rpp13-like protein. one unigene encoding an unknown protein was confirmed to be targeted by mir3084a .

identification of mirnas that are preferentially expressed in wheat grains
in order to screen the mirnas that are preferentially expressed in grains, we examined the genome-wide transcription profiles of mirna abundance across  <dig> different wheat tissues by high throughput sequencing . to visualize broad trends in the temporal expression of the mirnas, we performed simple hierarchical clustering to generate heatmaps . first, based on the outcome of the tissue classification in heatmaps, tissues that are similar in structure were grouped together, indicating that similar groups of mirnas were up- or down-regulated in the each tissue type. for example,  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap grains, 0–5 mm young spikes and 10–15 mm young spikes, dry grains and germinating seed embryos were grouped together. hierarchical clustering of these tissues by their mirna expression profiles suggested that the functions of mirnas can be appreciated based on the biology of the tissues in which it is uniquely expressed.

the heatmaps helped us to identify  <dig> mirnas from  <dig> families, including mir <dig> and mir <dig> etc., were specifically expressed in developing grains and the majority of these mirnas showed similar expression in  <dig> and  <dig> dap grains. a total of  <dig> mirnas including mir3002a and mir021b etc. from  <dig> families accumulated at higher levels in the dry seeds and germinating embryos . mir <dig> showed significantly higher expression level in  <dig> dap grains and dry grains compared to other tissues, and one gene encoding glyoxysomal malate dehydrogenase was putatively regulated by mir <dig> based on the degradome sequencing. it was reported that during wheat germination the number of glyoxysomes increased, and their associated enzyme including glyoxysomal malate dehydrogenase activities appeared, increasing up to the fifth or sixth day
 <cit> . we speculated that mir <dig> negatively regulate glyoxysomal malate dehydrogenase gene during wheat germination. in addition, we also found  <dig> mirnas including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir159b and mir171e were silenced in developing grains. mir <dig> negatively regulates the expression of gamyb genes at the posttranscriptional level, which was first identified as a downstream ga signaling target in aleurone cells of barley 
 <cit> , and tagamyb also has a pattern of higher expression in wheat developing grains
 <cit> . this result indicated that absence of mir <dig> in grains leading to higher expression of tagamyb, which would be consistent with its roles in endosperm grain filling and in the embryo.we further performed northern blot assays using rna samples from leaves, roots, stems, shoots, spikes, germinating seed embryos, flag leaves and developing grains to validate the preferential expression the mirnas in wheat grains . the northern blot results revealed that tae-mir2003a was expressed specifically in developing grains, and tae-mir3061a showed higher expression in germinating seed embryos, shoots, leaves, roots and stems. tae-mir021b was expressed specifically in germinating seed embryos, showing strong concordance with the expression profile obtained through illumina sequencing. tae-mir3117b exhibited higher expression in stems and roots and relatively lower expression in germinating seeds, shoots, and leaves, different from what was observed in the high-throughput sequencing results . tae-mir044a showed variable expression pattern across different tissues.the embryos and endosperm of developing grains were not separated during the small rna library construction and northern blot analysis; therefore, we further examined the expression profiles of grain-abundant mirnas in embryos and endosperm during grain mature at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 28 days after pollination  . by northern blot, we found that tae-mir156a, tae-mir2003a, tae-mir021b, tae-mir3117a specifically accumulated in embryos and all gradually increased from  <dig> to  <dig> dap, with the exception of mir3117a, which showed lower expression in  <dig> dap embryo than  <dig> dap embryo. the expression of tae-mir3117b and tae-mir3061a were determined by rt-pcr, and the results indicated that tae-mir3117b exhibited the highest expression level in  <dig> dap embryo, which was different from tae-mir3117a, even they possessed similar sequences with the exception of two snps. in addition, tae-mir3061a mainly appeared in the endosperm and  <dig> dap embryo . these mirnas were mainly expressed in the late stage of seed development, when starch and storage proteins accumulate and the seeds mature, indicating that these mirnas might be involved in seed maturation.

discussion
wheat genome contains a huge set of conserved and wheat-specific mirnas
previous studies have reported identification of  <dig> mirnas associated with development and stress response in wheat by sequencing small rna population
 <cit> . these known mirnas were identified from certain tissues such as seedlings or developing grains, or from mixed tissues including stems, leaves, roots and spikes. in this study, we extended the identification of wheat mirnas to  <dig> and broaden the knowledge of tissues that some mirnas preferentially expressed. the present study represents the first whole genome scale identification of wheat mirnas from diverse tissues and the first large scale expression comparison among various tissues. without a sequenced genome for wheat, it is difficult to map mirnas to wheat genome sequences and predict potential foldback structures; therefore, these studies have provided only a partial understanding of wheat mirna population. recently, based on the whole-genome shotgun strategy, draft genomes for bread wheat
 <cit> , its a-genome progenitor triticum urartu 
 <cit>  and its d-genome progenitor aegilops tauschii 
 <cit>  have been reported, which will facilitate genome-scale mirna analyses in wheat. in the present study, we systematically annotated a total of  <dig> mirnas belonging to  <dig> families in  <dig> different tissues based on the draft wheat genome sequences, identifying  <dig> highly conserved mirnas and  <dig> wheat-specific mirnas at a genome-wide scale, thus significantly increasing the number of known mirna genes in wheat. this extremely large set of mirnas is likely associated with the polyploid nature of wheat, which is reasonably consistent with the higher gene numbers, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , reported in bread wheat than its diploid progenitor and other species such as rice, maize and arabidopsis. for a given mirna locus in a diploid, there are three loci in a hexaploid, or more if the locus was duplicated in the diploid or tetraploid progenitor species or duplicated after the allopolyploid event, which might lead to a particularly large set of mirnas at the genome scale.

origins and evolution of wheat mirnas
many canonical mirnas are conserved among moss, eudicots, and monocots, and some regulate conserved targets and display conserved functions among land plants. our observations regarding  <dig> highly conserved mirnas from  <dig> families provided evidence that these mirnas are evolutionarily conserved in the plant kingdom. however, we also found multiple wheat-specific variants of conserved mirnas exhibiting nucleotide substitutions as compared to other species. the divergence of these variants within highly conserved mirna families might suggest that they have evolved at different rates. furthermore, through degradome sequencing, we identified and validated a large set of non-conserved targets for the conserved mirnas, in addition to the conserved target genes. however, the fact that these variations may or may not affect target specificity in wheat although they are wheat-specific, raising the question whether these conserved mirna variants evolved independently to acquire wheat-specific functions.

the wheat-specific mirnas identified in this study are particularly interesting because they may function in a species-specific manner in wheat growth and development. in plants, a minority of the annotated mirna gene families are conserved between plant families, while the majority are family or species specific, suggesting that most known mirna genes arose relatively recently in evolutionary time
 <cit> . in the present study, several observations indicated that unlike highly conserved mirnas, species-specific mirnas are often weakly expressed, processed imprecisely and lack targets. first, we compared the average abundances of highly conserved and wheat-specific mirnas, which indicated that the average number of reads for highly conserved mirnas reached  <dig>  rp10m, while that for wheat-specific mirnas was  <dig> . box plots show that the normalized expression of highly conserved mirnas was significantly higher than that of wheat-specific mirnas  . second, we identified  <dig> target genes for  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> target genes for  <dig> wheat-specific mirnas, but we were unable to obtain putative targets for the remainder of the  <dig> wheat-specific mirnas, suggesting a lack of or low expression of these target genes. third, wheat-specific mirnas regulated fewer targets  on average compared to the highly conserved mirnas , further suggesting a lack of targets for the wheat-specific mirnas.

target genes of conserved and wheat-specific mirnas
the integration of mirnas in diverse biological networks relies on the conformation of their target genes. therefore, degradome sequencing has been broadly applied to understand the roles of target gene degradation in transcriptional regulation. in this study, a total of  <dig> potential targets were identified for  <dig> putative mirna families through degradome sequencing, and the cleavage of  <dig> genes was validated through 5′ race. for highly conserved mirnas,  <dig> target genes were identified, including  <dig> targets that are conserved among other species and  <dig> non-homologous target genes. these non-conserved targets of mirnas might evolve specific properties and display unique functions in wheat growth and development. in addition, it remains unclear whether the non-conserved targets and conserved targets shared by conserved mirnas are related to a common biochemical pathway, although they are not homologous genes. it will be worthy to determine whether the non-conserved targets of conserved mirnas are biologically relevant or merely represent a neutral, accidental event.

there are two outstanding characteristics related to the potential biological functions of the target genes of wheat mirnas. first, the genes targeted by these mirnas showed a strong tendency toward displaying transcription factors or transcription regulatory activity. the majority of these targets belongs to conserved ones regulated by highly conserved mirnas and is involved in diverse aspects of plant growth and development. a large number of target genes were also found to be involved in protein metabolism, among which 38% and 34% were involved in protein degradation and synthesis, respectively. enrichment of protein synthesis and degradation functions was observed in transition-stage sams, and protein synthesis, turnover and balance are required to establish a shoot meristem
 <cit> . therefore, our results might indicate that meristem development is also subject to mirna regulation through the regulation of target genes responding to protein synthesis and degradation.

highly or specifically expressed mirnas during wheat grain development
the mirnas found to be highly or specifically expressed during wheat grain development in this study are particularly interesting because wheat grains provide approximately 55% of the carbohydrates consumed by humans
 <cit> . to investigate the roles of small rnas in grain development and to identify potentially seed-specific small rnas, several groups have employed high-throughput sequencing technology to sequence small rna populations from developing seeds in rice
 <cit> , barley
 <cit> , maize
 <cit>  and soybean
 <cit> . the obtained sequencing data suggest that rice mir1428e_3p is highly expressed in grains and cleaves two sbrk1b kinases, which play a role in regulating starch accumulation based on their expression in the endosperm and aleurone
 <cit> . in addition, arabidopsis mirnas including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> inhibit the expression of differentiation-promoting transcription factors such as arf <dig>  cna, phb, phv, and tcp <dig> to enable proper embryonic patterning
 <cit> . the presence of a large set of mirna molecules in the developing seeds from various species provides some indication that many processes that occur during seed development are under the control of mirna regulation.

in this study, a total of  <dig> mirnas from  <dig> families were found to be specifically expressed in developing grains, among which  <dig> mirnas were wheat specific, indicating these mirnas might be involved in wheat grain development in a wheat-specific manner. we also found a number of genes associated with grain development that serve as mirna targets, such as gamma-gliadin and late embryogenesis abundant protein. we found a number of grain-abundant mirnas specifically expressed in the embryo or endosperm during grain development . for example, mir156a specifically accumulated in the embryo and gradually increased from  <dig> to  <dig> dap. in arabidopsis embryos, mir <dig> delays the production of maturation transcripts by directing the repression of spl10/ <dig> <cit> . therefore, wheat mir <dig> might also be involved in late embryo maturation during wheat grain development.

the 22 nt mirna regulation pathway in seed development
the present study showed that 22 nt mirnas displayed markedly higher expression level in seed tissues, including in dry grains, germinating seed embryos, and grains  <dig> and 15 days after pollination, compared to other tissues, which was quite contrary to the expression pattern of 21 nt mirnas . it has been reported that 22 nt mirnas and sirnas are associated with ago <dig>  which recruits the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdr <dig> to generate double-stranded rna from 3′ cleavage fragments, initiating the production of a second wave of sirnas, referred to as secondary or “transitive” sirnas
 <cit> . we speculate that 22 nt mirnas might involve in directing the generation of phased sirnas during wheat seed germination and maturation. enrichment of 22 nt srnas in grain has been reported in maize
 <cit>  and soybean
 <cit> , but not in rice
 <cit> . the available data suggest that a different selection of 22 nt sirnas/mirnas involved in seed development might have arisen during the evolution of dicotyledon and monocotyledon plants. the accumulation of 22 nt mirnas might be optimized to simultaneously silence multiple members of a gene clade, and ta-sirnas triggered by 22 nt mirnas might serve as a means to extend the targeting range of the primary mirna
 <cit> . in this study, northern blotting analysis revealed that two 22 nt mirnas, tae-mir021b and tae-mir2003a, showed preferential accumulation in the embryo rather than the endosperm, suggesting important roles for mirna-mediated gene regulation in wheat grain.

CONCLUSIONS
we conducted a genome-wide survey of wheat mirnas from multiple wheat tissues of different developmental stages. the results indicated that a total of  <dig> novel mirnas were characterized and  <dig> previously reported mirnas were confirmed in our dataset. furthermore,  <dig> potential targets for  <dig> mirna families were determined through degradome sequencing. based on the genome-wide identification and characterization of mirnas and their associated target genes, we further identified  <dig> mirnas preferentially expressing in developing or germinating grains, which could play important roles in grain development.
