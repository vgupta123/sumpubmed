BACKGROUND
in eukaryotes, cells are subdivided into membrane-bound subcellular organelles  <cit> . subcellular localization of metabolic enzymes can give precise control over where these are synthesized and operate  <cit> . such compartmentalization of metabolic enzymes and metabolites of pathways provides a regulatory mechanism to control metabolic pathways. moreover, many pathways such as the β-oxidation of fatty acids occur in several subcellular organelles. the differentiation of localization of these pathways often causes the differences in their efficiency in utilizing the metabolites  <cit> . the regulatory mechanisms for coordinating the different metabolic environments in different organelles are more complex  <cit> . furthermore, incorrect localization of enzymes are often implicated in serious diseases  <cit> . thus, understanding the distribution patterns of pathway localization is essential in discovering potential regulatory mechanisms and the localization of metabolic pathways. in addition, the spatial distribution pattern information of pathways is also important in clarifying pathway boundaries and in discovering the mechanism of intermediate communication between different subcellular compartments  <cit> .

however, the subcellular localization information of pathways and their related enzymes has not been systematically integrated. the popular pathway databases such as kegg, biocyc, mpw and amaze are constructed for specific research tasks such as the graphic representation or reconstruction of metabolic pathways  <cit> . thus, they seldom provide integrated localization information.

summary and classification of subcellular localization of metabolic pathways are the first steps towards understanding their roles in spatial differentiation and functional specialization. here, we present the first effort to systematically collect pathway localization information from the uniprot  <cit>  and kegg ligand databases  <cit> . the strategy to summarize pathway localization is mainly based on the pathway and subcellular localization annotations of their participating enzymes. using an automatic pipeline, the subcellular localization data of  <dig> pathways were integrated from  <dig> uniprot entries and their pathway annotations from uniprot and kegg pathway databases. furthermore,  <dig> superpathways involving  <dig> organisms were summarized from the  <dig> pathways. our results indicate that over eighty-eight percent of superpathways in the uniprot dataset occur in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria. also, over 70% of uniprot superpathways contain multiple locations. from our data, we have proposed four common reasons for multiple localization of superpathways. as the first system-wide collection for the subcellular localization of metabolic pathways, pathlocdb provides a valuable understanding of distribution patterns of metabolic pathways among cellular organelles in different organisms.

RESULTS
integration of uniprot and kegg ligand databases provides many clues for studying pathways and pathway evolution. here we present four types of applications for further studies.

differences in data content and pathway localization annotations from uniprot and kegg databases
our strategy to summarize the pathway localization was mainly based on the pathway and subcellular localization annotations from their participating enzymes. thus, only enzymes with both subcellular localization and pathway annotations satisfied our criterion. the enzyme localization data are from uniprotkb/swiss-prot  in uniprot  databases. the pathway annotations were fro uniprotkb/swiss-prot  and kegg ligand databases . in total, the pathlocdb database consists of subcellular localization information of  <dig> pathways summarized from  <dig> uniprot entries and their pathway annotations from uniprot and kegg pathway databases. to extract pathway localization across organisms, we defined a superpathway as a cluster of basic pathways with the same name from different organisms. a total of  <dig> superpathways across  <dig> organisms were extracted from  <dig> pathways. due to differences in data quality and in pathway annotations, three datasets were collected. the high quality dataset contains  <dig> pathways with localization information as well as  <dig> annotated superpathways across  <dig> organisms summarized from  <dig> uniprotkb/swiss-prot entries. the kegg pathway localization dataset includes  <dig> pathways and  <dig> superpathways with localization information of the participating enzymes summarized from  <dig> uniprotkb/swiss-prot entries of  <dig> organisms. a comprehensive dataset including  <dig> pathways with localization information was collected from  <dig> uniprot entries involving  <dig> organisms.

a quick comparison of localization distribution of superpathways in uniprotkb/swiss-prot and kegg datasets reveals different pathway notations. the top ten subcellular locations where superpathways localize in uniprotkb/swiss-prot dataset cover more than 99% of annotated superpathways . although the top ten organelle locations in kegg dataset also have a high coverage of all annotated superpathways, organelle locations and their coverage are different from those of the uniprotkb/ swiss-prot dataset . over 88% of superpathways in the uniprotkb/swiss-prot dataset occur in cytoplasm and mitochondria, whereas more nuclear and cell membrane superpathways are summarized in the kegg dataset. on average, as the kegg pathways usually combine multiple pathways from different organisms, each one of them spans over  <dig> locations. by contrast, most of uniprotkb/swiss-prot superpathways are localized in less than four organelles . regarding the organisms involved,  <dig> of  <dig> uniprotkb/swiss-prot superpathways occur in single organisms while the remaining  <dig> superpathways occur in multiple organisms. also from the view of pathway localization, our comparison of superpathway localization clearly reveals that uniprotkb/swiss-prot pathways are smaller in size than pathways from the kegg dataset. thus caution should be taken when interpreting pathway localization from different pathway databases.

discovery of conserved pathway locations across organisms and organism specific pathway localization
as the pathways in uniprotkb/swiss-prot do not combine biological processes of different organisms, it is useful to survey pathway localization differences in different organisms. many fundamental biological processes with conserved localization are functionally related to diseases. for instance, the pathway “polyol metabolism; myo-inositol degradation into d-glucuronate; d-glucuronate from myo-inositol” in our database is involved in the phosphatidylinositol second messenger system . the change of its conserved location in the cytoplasm to other regions could cause many neurological diseases  <cit> . the simplest conserved pathway localization pattern is the  <dig> superpathways with one single conserved location across several organisms in our database. we also find nine superpathways across more than  <dig> organisms satisfying the simplest conservation criterion of one single location: five in cytoplasm, three in mitochondria and one in peroxisome . consistent with previous studies  <cit> , the three fundamental pathways in mitochondria have highly conserved localization. “oxidative phosphorylation” localizes to the mitochondria in  <dig> organisms in the uniprot dataset, making it the most conserved localization of superpathway in our database.

the organism row is the count of all the organisms with single conserved superpathway localization.

using our database,  <dig> organism specific superpathways are found ,  <dig> of them being plant-specific such as “abscisic acid  biosynthesis”  <cit> , and  <dig> being fungi-specific. pathway localization specific to certain organisms could also be found by sorting out completely different patterns of localization between different organisms. for instance, the gene cullin- <dig> in our database belonging to “protein modification; protein neddylation” in arabidopsis thaliana mainly localizes to the nucleus during interphase and preprophase  <cit> . this is obviously different from homologous genes in mammals with their cellular membrane and lipid raft localization  <cit> . in total,  <dig> superpathways with such completely different localization patterns across organisms have been discovered . moreover,  <dig> superpathways with partially different localization patterns between organisms  have also been found. for example, “glycan biosynthesis; starch biosynthesis” in all surveyed plants are carried out in the chloroplast and the plastid, but the superpathways from some plants could localize additionally to the amyloplast.

classification of multiple subcellular locations of metabolic pathways and prediction of potential transport systems
pathways with multiple locations are a prevalent phenomenon. among the annotated  <dig> uniprotkb/swiss-prot superpathways,  <dig> of them occur in multiple locations. here we propose four common possible reasons giving rise to these multiple localization annotation of  <dig> uniprotkb/swiss-prot superpathways at the subcellular level. firstly, different organisms have different pathways, resulting in multiple annotations of subcellular localization of superpathways. the most common examples for this category are the pathways which generate atp from mitochondria and chloroplasts in different organism groups. secondly, many pathways are composed of a series of steps spanning several subcellular locations. like a production line, many intermetabolites are produced from one organelle to another, stepwise in pathways. thirdly, some pathways occur in parallel in several subcellular locations in a single organism. the obvious example is fatty acid β-oxidation occurring in the mitochondria as well as the peroxisome  <cit> . the other most common reason for multiple annotation of pathways is the fact that they are summarized from multiple localizing enzymes. an extreme example here is the first enzyme of gpi biosysthesis in humans, with five subunits  <cit> . four of its five subunits localize in the endoplasmic reticulum and the remaining one in the cytoplasm. however, the above four phenomena are often mixed together when we try to analyze the reasons for multiple localization of pathways .

regardless of the complex reasons leading to multiple annotation of pathway localization, each possible reason is useful for researchers to further explore its potential significance. the transport system or cross-talk between organelles are made up of common processes for translocation of intermediates  <cit> . focusing on the  <dig> pathways of the uniprotkb/swiss-prot dataset,  <dig> pathways with multiple locations are summarized from the multiple localizations of their translocation steps . these results provide information on the potential existence of a transport system between these pathways with different locations and different steps. for instance, the pathway titled “amine and polyamine degradation; betaine degradation; sarcosine from betaine” consists of two steps in human, mouse and rat. the first step of this pathway occurs in cytoplasm in the three organisms, while the second step is in the mitochondria. further experimental studies on the potential transport system between the first and second steps of the pathway in mammals may be interesting and useful.

pathways occurring in parallel in multiple locations and duplicated pathways in human
using our database,  <dig> pathways occurring in parallel in several locations in human are found. on combini ng these pathways with the gene duplication dataset in human  <cit> ,  <dig> genes from  <dig> of the  <dig> pathways are detected to be duplicated during evolution . taking two duplicated genes 17-beta-hsd  <dig> and 17-beta-hsd  <dig> as examples, their protein products are localized to the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum respectively. both proteins are involved in the “steroid biosynthesis; estrogen biosynthesis” pathway. similar phenomena also exist in the “protein modification; protein sumoylation” and “protein modification; protein ubiquitination” pathways in human. occurrence of such a high proportion of enzyme duplication during pathway evolution also deserves further study.

discussion
to our knowledge, the present study represents the first of its kind, presenting a genome-wide collection of subcellular localization of metabolic pathways in cells across  <dig> organisms. with high quality data from the uniprotkb/swiss-prot and kegg databases, we have compared the pathway localization annotations of the two databases and found that the contributions from kegg are larger than those from uniprotkb/swiss-prot.

a characteristic feature of this study is the summary of common reasons for the multiple annotations of pathway localization. recently high throughput proteomics data suggest that proteins with multiple locations constitute  <dig> percent of the total  <dig> proteins in mouse liver  <cit> . our database shows that over 70% of uniprotkb/swiss-prot superpathways have multiple localization annotations. the consistent phenomena at the pathway level confirm that differentiation of localization of biological function is prevalent. intensive studies on the pathways which are carried out through a series of steps spanning several subcellular locations reveal  <dig> potential transport systems between different steps of multiple localizing pathways.

based on the multiple localization pathways from different organisms, we discovered possibly for the first time, all the conserved pathway localizations across organisms and organism-specific pathway localizations. this systematic comparison of pathway localization between organisms reveals that numerous pathways occur at different locations, providing clues for the differentiation and specialization of the pathway localizations between organisms.

focusing on the  <dig> pathways occurring in parallel in multiple locations in human, we identified  <dig> pathways containing gene duplication events to gain new locations. according to one of the most popular pathway evolution models, the “patchwork model”, enzymes with broad substrate specificities are more likely to be recruited to execute a new metabolic function  <cit> . although our analyses show that a high proportion of enzyme duplication occurs during pathway evolution, the mechanism of gaining new locations need to be elucidated. phylogenetic distribution of n-terminal targeting signals of mitochondrial localizing proteins suggest that inter-compartmental duplication events could bring novel localization of gene products and expand the catalytic as well as the rna processing repertoire  <cit> . while multiple localizations of metabolic pathways provide more valuable clues for researchers to discover potential evolution routes, we hope further study will elucidate the possible mechanisms.

in conclusion, these analyses demonstrate that our database is valuable in the discovery of potential cross-talk between different steps and the variation of localization of pathways between organisms.

CONCLUSIONS
pathlocdb was constructed as a free web-accessible database and analysis server to enable biochemical researchers to quickly access to summarized subcellular localization of metabolic pathways of uniprot and kegg pathway database. as the first effort to systematically collect pathway localization, this database is very useful in discovering the variation of localization of pathways between organisms and also cross-talk between different organelles within a pathway. the pathlocdb database can be accessed at http://pathloc.cbi.pku.edu.cn.
