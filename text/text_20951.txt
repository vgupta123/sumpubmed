BACKGROUND
microsporidia possess among the smallest, most compact eukaryotic genomes known  <cit> . all microsporidia are intracellular parasites and alternate between a thick-walled, extracellular stage  and intracellular stages . when triggered, a specialized structure called the polar tube shoots out of the spore and, upon contacting a host cell, creates a passageway into the host  <cit> . if a host cell is infected, meronts will proliferate, then undergo sporogony before being released from the host cell. the mammalian parasite encephalitozoon cuniculi typically infects humans with compromised immunity due to hiv-infection or immune-suppressive therapy  <cit> . e. cuniculi was the first microsporidian to have its genome completely sequenced, and at  <dig>  mb this highly reduced genome possesses many unusual features. it has a reduced coding capacity, encoding less than two thousand protein-coding genes, most of which are shorter than their homologs in yeast  <cit> . it lacks genes for several biosynthetic pathways and components of the energy-producing tricarboxylic acid cycle. this stripped down genome provides an opportunity to study cellular processes that generally require large, complex sets of components, yet in microsporidia such complexity is reduced, while retaining function. the spliceosome is a large macromolecular machine that is responsible for removing nuclear spliceosomal introns from pre-mrna via two transesterification reactions  <cit> . in humans, this complex rivals the size of the bacterial ribosome and contains hundreds of protein components and five small nuclear rnas . conversely, e. cuniculi is only predicted to possess  <dig> spliceosomal proteins  <cit> . such reduced eukaryotes could hold important information about intron and spliceosome evolution as they harbor so few spliceosomal introns , and some microsporidia are completely devoid of introns and splicing machinery  <cit> .

in a previous study we assessed differences in e. cuniculi transcription and spliced transcript levels between intracellular and extracellular life stages  <cit> . we found that transcripts have much longer untranslated regions  and more transcription start sites in the spore stage compared to the intracellular stage. splicing appears to take place exclusively in the intracellular stage leaving long, unspliced transcripts in the spore, that may play a structural rather than an informational role  <cit> . although pre-mrna splicing occurs, we found no evidence for alternative splicing or mis-splicing  <cit> . we also found that e. cuniculi intron-containing genes have exclusively short 5'utrs and that, on average, intracellular stage 5'utr lengths are among the shortest known  <cit> . another unusual feature of microsporidian transcription is the presence of overlapping transcripts in the extracellular stage. e. cuniculi and the distantly related microsporidian antonospora locustae were both found to have overlapping transcripts  <cit> . however, transcripts in the former often initiate in upstream genes, while those in the latter often terminate in downstream genes  <cit> . these peculiarities of microsporidian molecular biology and the differences in transcripts between extracellular and intracellular life stages led us to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the parasite’s transcriptome during intracellular stages.

using illumina hiseq technology we performed deep rna sequencing of the e. cuniculi transcriptome  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr, and  <dig> hr post-infection. this allowed us to assess spliced transcript and gene expression levels at multiple time points, find novel transcribed regions , and improve gene annotations. rna-seq is an ideal method for examining transcriptomes, as it is relatively unbiased, has greater sensitivity than hybridization methods such as microarrays, and produces high coverage of transcripts  <cit> . we analyzed splicing at all  <dig> splice junctions to assess the role of these few remaining e. cuniculi introns, determined gene expression levels of all annotated genes, found several novel orfs and, in general, increased our understanding of the dynamic transcriptomes of these unusual parasites.

RESULTS
genomic analyses of microsporidian species have revealed a number of unusual features that are distinct from other eukaryotes. to date, the microsporidia examined have either done away with introns and splicing machinery entirely, or retain very few of each. how these introns are spliced with greatly reduced machinery, and why so few are retained are questions that pertain both specifically to the evolution of these parasites and, more generally, to intron splicing in eukaryotes. in this study, we present the first transcriptomic analysis of e. cuniculi. intracellular stage genotype  <dig> e. cuniculi was examined at three time-points:  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr, and  <dig> hr after infection of rk <dig> cells . a total of  <dig>  million reads were produced ,  <dig>  million  of which aligned to the e. cuniculi genotype  <dig> reference genome   <cit> , and  <dig>  million  of which aligned to the rabbit host . we saw no evidence of cross mapping between host and parasite genomes, as expected, owing to the availability of reference genomes for both organisms and the high level of divergence between them . the number of reads mapping to e. cuniculi at  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr, and  <dig> hr post-infections were  <dig>  million,  <dig>  million, and  <dig>  million, respectively. this was sufficient coverage to assess splicing and examine gene expression levels at each time-point in order to address questions regarding intron function and evolution, as well as the expression of pathogenesis-related and microsporidia-specific genes.

the number of reads mapping to encephalitozoon cuniculi and oryctolagus cuniculus at three post-infection time-points are shown.

identification of novel transcribed regions
we annotated eleven previously unidentified, transcribed orfs, three of which have the potential to play a role in pathogenesis. these eleven orfs are distributed over eight chromosomes. e. cuniculi chromosomes were annotated using glimmer to find putative orfs with a minimum length cut-off of either  <dig> or 150nt  <cit> . orfs were used for blast searches followed by protein domain identification. this type of annotation leaves open the possibility of orfs not being annotated due to their small size or lack of known, conserved domains. in order to find novel orfs that may have been overlooked by the automated annotation software, we examined each chromosome visually using integrated genomics viewer  <cit>  .

the novel orf on chromosome  <dig>  is a potential candidate for a pathogenesis-related gene involved in cell entry. although no clear function for this orf could be predicted from similarity searches, weak  similarity to a viral entry protein could suggest that the product of this orf functions in host invasion. we discovered two additional orfs that are so far unique to microsporidia, and therefore may play a role relating to their parasitic lifestyle. novel orf ecu03_ <dig> has a clear homolog in e. hellem, sharing 72% identity over all  <dig> amino acids. although not present in all known microsporidian genomes, this orf shares similarity with genes of unknown function in antonospora locustae and nematocida parisii, two distantly related microsporidia. a second orf that appears to be microsporidia-specific is ecu06_ <dig>  which shares 41% identity over  <dig> of its  <dig> amino acids with homeobox domain-containing transcription factors in other encephalitozoon species. the products of these orfs will require functional analysis to ascertain the cellular roles of their microsporidia-specific protein products.

an additional orf  we discovered has no predicted connection to pathogenesis, but may play an important cellular role as it shows similarity to the nucleolar protein nop <dig>  nop <dig> is associated with snornas in ribonucleoprotein complexes that are involved in 18s rrna production, rrna pseudouridylation, and are components of the telomerase complex  <cit> . additional novel orfs had very weak similarity to known proteins, and were identified based on transcription signal alone . also, several predicted intergenic regions were transcribed with distinct boundaries but no orf could be assigned on either strand. these may represent important non-coding rnas or possibly even unknown selfish genetic elements.

all coding genes are transcribed in intracellular e. cuniculi
the expression data revealed that nearly all  <dig> genes had detectable levels of expression in all three time-points : all  <dig> genes were expressed  <dig> hr post-infection,  <dig> genes were expressed  <dig> hr post-infection, and  <dig> genes were expressed  <dig> hr post-infection. the twenty genes with highest average expression, in descending order, include spore wall protein  <dig>  rna-binding domain-containing protein , translation elongation factor  <dig> alpha, actin, histones h2b/h3/h2a/h <dig>  heat shock protein  <dig>  and ribosomal protein l <dig>  the remaining ten genes encode hypothetical proteins with unknown functions. as expected, many highly-expressed genes have housekeeping functions; however, the most highly expressed gene, excluding hypotheticals, is a spore wall protein-encoding gene. this highlights the priority of preparing to form the infective stage, even as early as the first  <dig> hrs following infection. in summary, essentially all e. cuniculi protein-coding genes are expressed during the first three days post-infection in tissue culture.

high frequency of differentially expressed genes in the first  <dig> hrs
although nearly all genes are expressed at all time-points, we found an abundance of genes with considerable differences in expression levels between time-points. there were  <dig>  genes differentially expressed between  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr post-infection and  <dig>  genes differentially expressed between  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr . however, between  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr there were only  <dig> genes differentially expressed , all with fairly weak fold changes of less than  <dig> . this pattern, where many genes are differentially expressed within the first  <dig> hrs but not after, has implications for the life-cycle of this parasite, such as the possibility that spore formation begins by  <dig> hr post-infection.

evidence from expression data suggests that e. cuniculi meronts undergo a shift towards producing spore-related genes by  <dig> hr post-infection. the ten genes with largest positive and negative fold change between  <dig> hr and the two subsequent time-points includes mostly housekeeping genes and genes encoding hypothetical proteins. an exception to this is polar tube protein  <dig>  whose gene had some of the strongest positive fold changes, both from  <dig> hr to  <dig> hr  and from  <dig> hr to  <dig> hr . also, the gene encoding polar tube protein  <dig> showed a similar pattern, with a fold change of  <dig> , while the spore wall protein-encoding gene had a fold change of  <dig> . this suggests that expression of spore-related genes increases by  <dig> hr and spore formation could be taking place, however we did not see evidence of spore-specific transcripts with extended 5′utrs  <cit> , even by  <dig> hr post-infection. this is in line with previous experiments, which have found a spore related gene to have increased expression between  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr post-infection  <cit> , and evidence of spore-containing vacuoles beginning at  <dig> hr post-infection  <cit> .

housekeeping genes are down-regulated after  <dig> hr, providing evidence that proliferation is taking place very soon after spore germination and likely for a very brief time. among the ten most strongly down-regulated genes are several ribosomal protein genes, ubiquitin, an rna polymerase, two novel orfs, and several hypothetical protein encoding genes. down-regulation of housekeeping genes after the  <dig> hr time-point likely occurs because their expression is high upon germination. we also found that, while many ribosomal protein genes have relatively weak fold changes, they are all negative, further evidence that housekeeping genes as a whole are being down-regulated after  <dig> hrs. in summary, it seems that spore-specific proteins are produced early in the intracellular life-stage, although spores are likely not formed until after  <dig> hr post-infection, and housekeeping genes are being down-regulated after  <dig> hr, possibly as a result of slowing intracellular stage replication rates.

analysis of pre-mrna splicing
e. cuniculi has a reduced spliceosome
gene annotation in e. cuniculi identified just  <dig> orfs with similarity to spliceosomal components  <cit> , predicting one of the smallest functional spliceosomes known. several components that are required for viability in yeast are absent in e. cuniculi, raising questions about the necessity of these components, the redundancy built into this pathway, and the flexibility of the spliceosome. also, one of the five rna components, the u <dig> snrna, has not been identified  <cit> . this suggests that splicing may be occurring without a complete u <dig> complex, which is involved in the key first step of splicing when the intron is recognized and bound at the 5' splice site  <cit> . the reduction in e. cuniculi spliceosome machinery is severe and is likely to have an effect on the splicing reaction, potentially reducing splicing efficiency.

discovery of introns and splice isoforms
the original genome annotation of e. cuniculi predicted  <dig> introns, almost all of which were in ribosomal protein genes  <cit> . the number of introns was increased to  <dig> after a thorough search was performed with a combination of visual and string-search algorithm methods  <cit> . many of these new introns were found in non-ribosomal protein-coding genes, which has implications for our understanding of intron retention and evolution in microsporidia . ranging in size from 22– <dig> nt, e. cuniculi introns are among the smallest spliceosomal introns found in nature, surpassed only by the miniature introns of paramecium tetraurelia <cit>  and the chlorarachniophyte nucleomorph genomes  <cit> . all e. cuniculi introns have standard gt-ag boundaries, and relatively strict 5' splice site and branch point motifs . this is in line with phylogenetically broad genomic analyses, which have shown that strict splicing motifs are common in intron-poor genomes  <cit> . utilizing the rna-seq dataset we confirmed that all previously annotated introns are indeed spliced and are bona fide introns. also, we found one new intron that creates a novel orf , and confirmed splicing of two others that were recently discovered in a comparison of four encephalitozoon species  <cit> . these three recently detected introns were each confirmed with more than a hundred spliced transcripts, as well as having motifs that are characteristic of e. cuniculi introns .

we have found the first evidence of alternative splicing in a microsporidian parasite. a small proportion of transcripts for three intron-containing genes utilize alternative downstream acceptor sites. although unexpected to find alternative splicing in such a reduced, streamlined system, the alternative transcripts are so rare that they may represent erroneous splice events. in all cases observed, the alternative isoform represents less than 5% of the reads at the corresponding junction. despite their low abundance, it is possible that the alternative forms could be utilized as another post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism by inducing rapid decay, as has been hypothesized in p. falciparum <cit> . if these transcripts were to induce decay this would help explain the rarity at which we observe them. unfortunately, we lack the tools needed to manipulate decay rates in microsporidia, and therefore cannot test this hypothesis directly. we also see evidence of alternative intron retention, most notably in ecu11_ <dig> . in this case the upstream intron is spliced at higher levels than the downstream intron, which would result in some transcripts being truncated at the 3' end, but potentially still functional. since no genes that function in alternative splicing regulation, such as sr protein family genes, have been found in e. cuniculi, we suggest that variation in intron motif features are responsible for differing levels of intron retention within a gene. it has been shown previously that modification to intron motifs can affect splicing efficiency  <cit> . therefore, alternative splicing could be playing a minor role in e. cuniculi gene expression.

comparative analysis of intron-containing transcripts
we quantified transcript abundance of intron-containing genes to assess levels of intron-retention versus intron removal in order to get a better understanding of the roles of pre-mrna splicing and rna decay in e. cuniculi. there are several possible scenarios with regards to levels of pre-mrna splicing and rna decay. one scenario would be that decay rates are low, and the levels of intron retention or removal are dictated by splicing levels. another option would be that decay is efficient, creating high levels of spliced transcripts whether or not splicing is efficient, as well. we found that, on average, levels of spliced transcripts in e. cuniculi were very low . a staggering  <dig> of  <dig> introns  had less than 50% of transcripts with introns removed, and  <dig>  of these had below 20% spliced transcripts. levels of intron-lacking, or spliced, transcripts ranged from less than 5% to over 85%, with one particularly interesting outlier at the high end of the range. the gene ecu09_ <dig>  an rna binding domain-containing protein-coding gene, had previously been noted as unusual for containing the longest e. cuniculi intron. in this study we found further reason to examine this gene closely as it had the highest levels of splicing and it was one of the few introns with significant differences in splicing levels between time-points. on the other hand, since all e. cuniculi introns contain stop codons or cause frameshifts if not properly removed, it is surprising that the majority of them appear to be spliced at such low levels. for example, over half of the transcripts of thirty of these genes appear to be non-functional because they retain introns. this suggests that decay rates are low  and pre-mrna splicing has a strong influence on levels of transcripts with introns retained or removed.

to assess whether these transcripts were unique to microsporidia or common to parasites and organisms with compact genomes, we performed a similar examination of splicing levels in a free-living and a parasitic fungus. the transcriptomes of saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida albicans encode  <dig> and  <dig> introns, respectively  <cit> . the introns of both are similar in size, generally in the 50-1000nt range  <cit> . although these fungi possess similarly sized spliceosomes that lack over twenty components found in mammals, they encode more than twice as many components as e. cuniculi, and therefore, e. cuniculi still represents a model of extreme reduction.

levels of splicing in both s. cerevisiae and c. albicans were distinctly different from those observed in e. cuniculi, with averages of 80% in s. cerevisiae and 95% in c. albicans . we found that  <dig> of  <dig>  s. cereveisiae introns were spliced at levels above 80%, while  <dig> of  <dig>  were spliced at levels above 50%. splicing levels in c. albicans were comparable with  <dig> of  <dig>  spliced at levels above 80%, and  <dig> of  <dig>  spliced at levels above 50%. also, a similar analysis of splicing levels has been performed in the relatively reduced parasitic protist p. falciparum, the causative agent of malaria  <cit> . the authors found that in this unicellular parasite splicing levels were quite high on average, with a median of five times more spliced reads than intron-retained reads observed  <cit> . they also note that only  <dig> % of introns were spliced at levels below 50%  <cit> . therefore, spliced transcript levels in e. cuniculi are drastically lower than those in both a fungal and a very distantly related protistan parasite, as well as a free-living fungus. this result, along with the fact that the e. cuniculi spliceosome is much more reduced than p. falciparum and both fungal species, indicates that it may not be the life-style of the organism that is having such an effect on splicing, but the severe reduction of the spliceosomal machinery. if, over evolutionary timescales, the loss of spliceosomal components resulted in decreases in splicing levels, the reduction of the spliceosome could not have reached its current point unless the levels of intron-containing gene expression were acceptable for cell viability and decay rates increased to compensate for increased intron-containing transcripts. therefore, the spliceosomal core is likely much smaller than we expect, since mutations in introns and increases in gene expression levels can compensate for decreased splicing levels.

one possible reason for the abundance of transcripts with introns retained is that they could be playing a functional role in gene regulation. for example, several ribosomal protein-coding genes in yeast are known to perform autoregulatory splicing: where the product of the splicing reaction inhibits further splicing by specifically binding to newly made transcripts  <cit> . other yeast genes have their splicing regulated by environmental stress, such as amino acid starvation  <cit> , or in conjunction with the meiotic cycle  <cit> . we found  <dig> of  <dig> junctions with significant differences in splicing levels between time-points, most with relatively modest changes . interestingly, one of the few genes with two introns had significant changes in splicing in both introns, including the largest change , and high variability in levels between introns . this provides evidence that splicing may be playing a regulatory role. however, even with nearly a third of intron-containing genes showing differences in splicing levels over the course of infection, nearly all changes are too small to warrant strong evidence of regulatory splicing. also, we failed to find any strong compensatory role of splicing to moderate expression levels of ribosomal genes, in order to balance their relatively high levels of variability. the low levels of splicing observed do not seem to be the result of regulation at the level of splicing in most cases, however, the splicing patterns of a few genes are indicative of regulation and will require further examination.

another plausible explanation for the elevated levels of intron-retained transcripts is that rna decay may not be functioning efficiently in e. cuniculi. since all e. cuniculi introns either contain stop codons or induce frameshifts that result in downstream pre-mature stop codons, intron retention should induce transcript degradation by an rna decay pathway. metabolic pathways are generally reduced in e. cuniculi <cit> , so complete rna decay pathways would not be expected. however, e. cuniculi appears to have retained a small number of decay proteins, encoding orfs with similarity to key players including upf <dig>  dcp <dig>  dis <dig>  dhh <dig>  ccr <dig>  and nmd <dig> . it is likely that these few decay proteins have evolved to function in the absence of their canonical reaction partners, similar to the spliceosome and dna repair system  <cit> , as the cell would presumably not be able to function properly without rna degradation. however, as we predict with spliceosomal functioning, there may be a significant reduction in decay efficiency that could play a part in increasing the proportion of unspliced transcripts present. yet, to invoke reduced rna decay as the sole source of these results, decay would have to be very inefficient indeed - a situation that seems unlikely given that no other obvious abnormalities are observed in the transcriptome. although a formal possibility, it seems unlikely that decay alone is the cause of the high levels of unspliced transcripts. therefore, the loss of spliceosome components is likely the cause of reduced splicing activity, and in combination with low decay rates, results in a large proportion of unspliced transcripts.

CONCLUSIONS
assessing the transcriptome of e. cuniculi allowed us to improve the genome annotation, uncover novel transcribed regions that could play a role in pathogenesis, discover new introns, and assess levels of intron splicing. we found spliced transcript levels to be surprisingly low on average, most likely as a result of spliceosomal reduction, but with the potential for decreased decay rates to be playing a role. gene expression levels vary over the course of infection; tremendous numbers of genes are differentially expressed in the first  <dig> hrs post-infection, suggesting a major genetic change that likely precedes a life-stage change. the reduction of spliceosome and rna decay pathway components appears to be the cause of decreased splicing efficiency and an accumulation of unspliced, non-functional transcripts. this suggests that a balance is maintained between inefficiency resulting from gene loss, and continued pressure of genome reduction.
