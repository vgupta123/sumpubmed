BACKGROUND
herb epimedii, a traditional chinese medicinal herb, is prepared from the aerial parts of epimedium species of berberidaceae, which is a basal eudicot family containing enormous medicinal plants. e. sagittatum  maxim, together with other four epimedium species, e. brevicornu maxim, e. pubescens maxim, e. wushanense t. s. ying, and e. koreanum nakai, is listed in chinese pharmacopoeia  <cit> . herb epimediicontains various bioactive components and has been utilized extensively as a tonic and antirheumatic medicinal herb for thousands of years in china. currently, herb epimedii is still widely used to treat many diseases such as impotence, frequency/urgency of urination, coronary heart disease, chronic bronchitis, and neurasthenia  <cit> . in addition, epimedium species are also used as ground cover plants and ornamental plants because of the abundance of flower colours and flower patterns. therefore, epimedium species possess enormous potentials for commercial application. the molecular research of epimedium, however, is lagged behind. firstly, at present, many studies focus on extracting bioactive components from epimedium  <cit> , but metabolic pathways involved in producing these bioactive components are still largely unknown. secondly, many studies have attempted to distinguish taxonomically epimedium species and detect the genetic diversity of epimedium  <cit> . but only a few of genomic markers have been exploited, so far, in our lab for studying genetic diversity of natural populations, including  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ssrs for e. sagittatum  <cit> , e. koreanum  <cit> , and e. brevicornu  <cit> , respectively. the most important thing is that, according to our knowledge, most genomic ssrs exploited fail to transfer in other epimedium species. thus, more markers are needed for in-depth understanding of the natural diversity and for developing strategies for sustainable utilization of epimedium. thirdly, although many papers reported taxonomic results of epimedium using different molecular markers such as rapd  <cit> , rflp  <cit> , aflp  <cit> , and rdna  <cit> , the taxonomical relationships among epimedium species, especially closely related chinese species, are still not clear because of the shortcoming of molecular markers with little polymorphic information or the limited number of species sampled in former studies. moreover, the morphological characteristics of e. sagittatum vary greatly among different populations, and it is still not known whether it belongs to polytypic species or a complex of cryptic species. finally, according to our knowledge, the novel gene discovery and molecular breeding of epimedium new cultivars haven't been started yet due to the lack of genetic and genomic information.

generation of a large-scale expressed sequence tag  dataset is a useful approach to accelerate the researches of non-model species, especially for epimedium. as a valuable resource for comparative genomics, functional genomics and biodiversity study, est database has been established for model plant species and non-model species . so far, only three ranunculales species  have est sequences available in the public databases and very limited number of est sequences are available for these species. although two cdna libraries have been constructed using flower and leaf materials of e. brevicornu  <cit> , no est sequences have been uploaded to national center for biotechnology information  database yet. as of june  <dig>  only  <dig> nucleotide sequences are available for epimedium in ncbi.

comparing with other types of molecular markers, ssr marker has many advantages including high abundance, random distribution in the entire genome, high information content, codominant inheritance, and reproducibility. according to the original sequences used for identification of simple repeats, ssrs are divided in two categories, genomic ssrs derived from random genomic sequences and est-ssrs derived from expressed sequence tags. it is very time-consuming, cost-expensive and labor-intensive for developing genomic ssrs from the repeat-enriched genomic library when compared with the development of est-ssr. genomic ssrs have neither genic function nor close linkage to transcriptional regions, while est-ssrs are potentially tightly linked with functional genes that perhaps control certain important agronomic characters  <cit> . therefore, est-ssrs are very useful for mas in plant breeding. besides, est-ssr markers contain high transferability because est-ssrs are derived from expressed sequences that are more conserved than the non-genic sequences and can be found in other relative species  <cit> . due to the sharp increase of est sequences deposited in ncbi, more and more est-ssrs have been identified and used extensively for comparative mapping, dna fingerprinting, biodiversity, and evolutionary studies in lots of species  <cit> . so far, surveying the polymorphism, diversity and transferability of est-ssrs have been performed in vitis  <cit> , citrus  <cit> , coffea  <cit> , medicago  <cit> , glycine  <cit> , phaseolus  <cit> , hordeum  <cit> , festuca  <cit> , and triticum  <cit> .

here, we report the generation of a large-scale est dataset from young leaves of e. sagittatum using the cost-effective  <dig> gs-flx pyrosequencing technology, the development and characterization of a set of est-ssrs, and the transferability of est-ssrs across genus epimedium. therefore, the est dataset can lay a foundation and facilitate mas breeding and taxonomy in genus epimedium, and decode secondary metabolism in epimedium species.

RESULTS
contig assembly of  <dig> reads
a total of  <dig>  sequences  are generated from leaf cdnasof e. sagittatum. after removing smart primers, polya tail, and low quality sequences, a total of  <dig>  high quality sequences is retained with a total length of  <dig>  mb and an average length of  <dig>  bp ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp . after clustering and assembly,  <dig>  consensus sequences with a total length of  <dig>  mb  are obtained . the length of contigs ranges from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp with an average of  <dig>  bp, and that of singlets ranges from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp with an average of  <dig>  bp .

the size distribution of epimedium consensuses is shown in table  <dig>  the length for the majority of ests is 201- <dig> bp, which is consistent with the  <dig> gs-flx sequencing capacity. after the assembly, although the size distribution pattern of singlets is similar to that of whole est dataset, there are  <dig>  contigs with sequences longer than  <dig> bp . in addition, about  <dig> % of contigs are still less than  <dig> bp after assembly. this might be due to the short length of the individual read and/or the low coverage of the transcriptome represented in this dataset. most of the consensuses are derived from few reads. for example,  <dig>   and  <dig>   consensuses are derived from  <dig> and  <dig> reads, respectively .

note: the numbers in parentheses indicate the percentages of certain consensuses in all contigs.

structural and functional annotation of ests
the consensus sequences are blasted against non-redundant protein database  and  <dig>  consensuses comprising of  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singlets have significant hits to nr database . all the consensus sequences are also compared against pfam domain database and about 50%  of them are successfully annotated. gene ontology  terms are further assigned to  <dig>  epimedium consensus sequences that are successfully annotated based on pfam matches. only  <dig>  epimedium consensus sequences are able to be assigned go numbers. figure  <dig> shows the percentage distributions of gene ontology terms according to the go consortium. protein metabolic process  is the most dominant group out of  <dig>  consensus sequences that are annotated to the biological process category. it is followed by the biosynthetic process at  <dig> %, photosynthesis at  <dig> %, generation of precursor metabolites and energy at  <dig> %, cellular process at  <dig> %, translation at  <dig> %, metabolic process at  <dig> %, and carbohydrate metabolic process at  <dig> % . a total of  <dig>  sequences could be assigned to the molecular function category. binding  is the most dominant group followed by catalytic activity , structural molecular activity , hydrolase activity , nucleotide binding , transferase activity , and transcription regulator activity  . with regard to the cellular component,  <dig> % of  <dig>  consensus sequences are assigned to membrane followed by intracellular , ribosome  and extracellular region  .

being famous medicinal plants used in china, epimedium species have flavonoids as the major phytochemical components. there are also many other unidentified compounds in epimedium species  <cit> . thus, genes related to secondary metabolism, especially for the flavonoid biosynthesis, are under further studies in order to decipher the molecular mechanism of natural variation of phytochemical components and facilitate the molecular breeding of medicinal cultivars. in our est collection,  <dig> est consensus sequences are annotated relating to secondary metabolic process , including genes encoding key enzymes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase, 4-counaroyl:ligase coa, chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, flavanone  <dig> hydroxylase, flavanone 3' hydroxylase, flavanone 3'5' hydroxylase, flavonol synthase, flavone synthase, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase, anthocyanidin synthase, rhamnosyl transferase, and udpg-flavonoid glucosyl transferase. in addition, more than  <dig> est consensus sequences were annotated relating to transcription regulator activity , part of which might play roles in regulating flavonoid biosynthesis and metabolism. for example, regulatory genes are annotated as members of wd <dig> family, myb family, and bhlh family that can form a triplex compound to regulate the specific expression patterns of flavonoid structural genes. all these structural and regulatory genes are being cloned and functional studies are carrying out in our lab. further studies such as molecular modification  and metabolic engineering of enzymes are also in progress.

frequency and distribution of est-ssrs in the epimedium transcriptome
a total of  <dig>  sequences containing  <dig>  ssrs have been identified from  <dig>  consensus sequences, with  <dig> est sequences containing at less two ssrs. the frequency of est-ssrs observed in epimedium transcriptome is  <dig> %, and the distribution density is  <dig>  per mb. the occurrence of different repeat type is shown in table  <dig>  the most abundant repeat type is trinucleotide  followed by dinucleotide , tetranucleotide , hexanucleotide , and pentanucleotide repeat unit . the frequencies of est-ssrs distributed in different repeat numbers are also shown in table  <dig>  there are  <dig>  ssrs with  <dig> tandem repeats, which is the most common repeat number  followed by  <dig> tandem repeats ,  <dig> tandem repeats ,  <dig> tandem repeats  and  <dig> tandem repeats . the dominant repeat motif is aag/ctt with a frequency of  <dig> % , followed by ag/ct , acc/ggt , at/at , and aac/gtt  . more details about different repeat motif of di- and trinucleotide repeats in est-ssrs are listed in table  <dig>  it is interesting that there is no cg/gc repeat motif and very few ccg/cgg repeats in our results.

the epimedium est-ssr transferability
a total of  <dig> primer pairs , referred to esesp <dig> to esesp <dig>  have been stochastically selected among the  <dig>  microsatellites to amplify  <dig> dinucleotide ssrs and  <dig> trinucleotide ssrs for testing the transferability in other epimedium species . of these primer pairs, seven primer pairs  cannot amplify any fragment in e. sagittatum, suggesting that these primers are not well designed. four primers, esesp <dig>  esesp <dig>  esesp <dig>  and esesp <dig>  amplify numerous non-target bands, suggesting these primers are also problematic. three primer pairs, esesp <dig>  esesp <dig>  and esesp <dig>  succeed in transferring to other epimedium species, but amplify pcr products larger than the expected sizes. the rest of primer pairs produces polymorphic bands in most epimedium species as shown in figure  <dig>  therefore,  <dig> %  est-ssr primers can be transferred successfully to other epimedium species. in theoretically, there are  <dig> %  of  <dig>  namely ~ <dig>  e. sagittatum est-ssrs markers suitable for genetic studies in genus epimedium.

species from other genera, including vancouveria hexandra, nandina domestica thunb., berberis julianae schneid., berberis sargentiana schneid., dysosma versipellis  m. cheng ex ying, mahonia bealei  carr., and mahonia fortunei  fedde., have been used to test the transferability of epimedium est-ssrs across different genus of berberidaceae. a total of  <dig> primers, esesp <dig>  esesp <dig>  esesp <dig>  esesp <dig>  esesp <dig>  esesp <dig>  esesp <dig>  and esesp <dig>  can produce pcr fragments in v. hexandra  with similar sizes and same ssr motifs as those in epimedium . only four primers, esesp <dig>  esesp <dig>  esesp <dig>  and esesp <dig>  can amplify pcr fragments in other berberidaceae species mentioned above. however, sequences of the pcr fragments from genera berberis, nandina, dysosma, and mahonia, do not contain the ssr motifs found in epimedium species . therefore, epimedium est-ssrs can successfully transfer to vancouveria, but not other berberidaceae genera tested.

the genetic diversity and dendrogram in genus epimedium
a total of  <dig> individuals representing  <dig> species  have been used to evaluate the genetic diversity in genus epimedium. two primer pairs, esesp <dig> and esesp <dig>  detect a single band in some species while null in other species. thus, they are excluded for further study and the remaining  <dig> est-ssrs are used to estimate the genetic diversity among  <dig> species. a high level of genetic diversity in genus epimedium is discovered . the number of alleles per locus ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig>  alleles. ho ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> . he ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> . polymorphism information content  is from  <dig>  for esesp <dig> locus to  <dig>  for esesp <dig> locus. the observed length of pcr products vary greatly in a large spectrum compared with the fragment size in e. sagittatum . the size variation of amplicons reflects the length of repetitive sequences in each ssr locus, suggesting that the polymorphism might be related to the differences of tandem repeat numbers .

in order to study the evolutionary relationship among epimedium species, those  <dig> est-ssr primers successfully transferring in almost all epimedium species are used for reconstructing epimedium phylogeny. v. hexandra is used as an outgroup species, because it is more closely related to epimedium genus than jeffersonia dubia  benth. et hook. f. and podophyllum peltatum  <cit> . furthermore, sequences of some loci in v. hexandra amplified by epimedium est-ssr primers confirm that similar single nucleotide repeats exist in v. hexandra as mentioned above. as shown in additional file  <dig>  the phylogenetic relationship among all  <dig> species are supported by low bootstrap values, especially for chinese species, partially due to the small number of est-ssrs and the nature of est-ssr with low pic used in this study. previous studies also found it is hard to differentiate the closely related chinese species using different types of molecular markers including rapd  <cit> , rflp  <cit> , aflp  <cit> , and rdna  <cit> . therefore, more est-ssr markers or combining results of different types of markers would provide more opportunities for better resolving the phylogeny among epimedium species, which is an on-going project in our lab.

discussion
e. sagittatum ests annotation
currently, numerous studies are focusing on isolating the epimedium bioactive components  <cit> , but the potential molecular mechanism producing bioactive components is still unclear. furthermore, little or no information regarding to its biological conservation, population genetics, molecular breeding, and molecular biology is reported for epimedium species due to the lack of background information. the  <dig> gs-flx pyrosequencing technology is a very cost-effective method to obtain large-scale est sequences and will speed up the researches of less-studied epimedium species. the technology has been broadly used for bacteria de novo sequencing, cdna sequencing, small rna sequencing, metagenomic sequencing and whole genome shotgun survey http://www. <dig> com/news-events/publications.asp. margulies et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the technology had  <dig> fold sequencing capability at the cost of relative low accuracy than sanger-based capillary electrophoresis sequencing systems when the gs <dig> sequencing machine was used. recently, the new generation machine, gs-flx, possesses more powerful sequencing capability of up to 200- <dig> bp per read and higher sequencing accuracy than that of gs <dig> http://www. <dig> com. in this study, an epimedium transcriptome population is sequenced by  <dig> gs-flx system, and a total of  <dig>  sequence reads are generated. after assembly,  <dig>  consensus sequences are obtained.

it is noticeable that only  <dig>  epimedium consensuses have significant hits in the nr protein database . thus, there are a large number of sequences that don't have any significant match in other species . this might be due to the following reasons:  the shortness of sequence reads leading to assemble difficultly,  inefficiency of blast using short sequences and the incompleteness of the known database,  the advantages of deep sequencing, which can discover novel genes with low expression levels,  the shortness of sequence reads resulting in low efficiency of annotation, which was confirmed by correlation test between sequence length and percentage of sequences successfully annotated , and  part of consensuses representing utrs. with regard to the first point, the size of raw reads ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp with an average length of  <dig>  bp. after assembly, most contigs still range from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, and the average length only increased up to  <dig>  bp. it is also supported by the fact that most contigs were assembled with 2- <dig> reads . thus, the shortness of sequences is the main disadvantage in this scenario when using  <dig> pyrosequencing technologies. concerning on the second point, short query sequences might not be able to have sequence matches with a significant low e-value and high score, thus resulting in a high level of false negative results. in addition, ranunculales is much less studied when compared with core eudicots and monocots, suggesting that a lot of ranunculales lineage-specific genes might not be included in the database. as to the third point, est fragments are directly sequenced instead of being cloned and sequenced, which leads to the truly random sequencing of all the expressed genes and might facilitate the discovery of rare genes. emrich et al  <cit>  found that coupling of lcm  and  <dig> sequencing technologies could facilitate the discovery of rare, possibly cell-type-specific transcripts. in summary, the nature of shortness in reads generated by  <dig> gs-flx sequencing technology is the origin of low efficiency of annotation. however, it is still possible that new genes and/or ranunculales- or even epimedium- specific novel sequences could be discovered due to large-scale sequencing.

potential applications of epimedium est dataset
combining all the available information, we have a set of  <dig>  go-annotated epimedium consensus sequences, which is very valuable and cost-effective for a non-model organism by sequencing one tissue at certain developmental stage. additionally,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of  <dig>  epimedium go-annotated consensuses for biological processes are related to metabolic process, carbohydrate metabolic process, amino acid and derivative metabolic process, and secondary metabolic process, respectively . many bioactive components of epimedium might derive from these biological processes . a total of  <dig>  epimedium consensuses is annotated for molecular function,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of which have transcription regulator activity and catalytic activity, respectively, suggesting that these genes might take part in regulating and catalyzing the production of bioactive components . all of these sequences can provide fundamental information for the metabolic-engineering and molecular breeding of epimedium.

in details, this large est dataset of epimedium is a powerful resource for further studies. firstly, it can facilitate cloning genes of interest, especially for genes involved in controlling metabolic pathways such as the flavonoid pathway. the epimedium est dataset generated in our study will provide enough sequence information for designing primers to obtain full-length genes. therefore, these sequences will promote the molecular study of secondary metabolism in medicinal epimedium plants. secondly, molecular markers can be exploited based on est sequences for researches in the fields of biodiversity, taxonomy, and population genetics. although genomic ssrs have been developed from epimedium, they have much lower transferability among different epimedium species than est-ssrs  <cit> . therefore, est-ssrs can further promote the taxonomic study of epimedium species, especially those closely related chinese species. thirdly, it is noticeable that some est-based molecular markers might be linked to genes involved in controlling traits that are important for market value  <cit> . thus, est-ssrs can provide a powerful tool for genetic mapping and mas. in summary, the est dataset reported here can be used for decoding the molecular mechanism of the flavonoid pathway, as well as lays a foundation for biodiversity, population genetics, genomics, and functional genomics of epimedium species.

est-ssr frequency and distribution in epimedium transcriptome
a total of  <dig>  perfect microsatellites over  <dig> bp have been identified from epimedium est dataset, i.e.  <dig> % est sequences possess single sequence repeats. obviously, the frequency of ssrs detected in epimedium is similar to that of other dicotyledonous species ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %  <cit> . the est-ssr frequency is dependent on the following factors. firstly, parameters used in exploring microsatellites affect the results dramatically, such as the repeat length threshold and the number of repeat unit. in the present study, mononucleotide repeat motifs are excluded in our strategy for identifying microsatellites. secondly, the genome structure or composition may also account partially for the est-ssr frequency, because the genetic-biochemical background of the cells plays important roles in fixation of de novo-generated ssrs  <cit> . thirdly, different softwares used in detecting ssrs might also affect the frequency. some ssr identifying tools can find out imperfect ssr, for example, sputnik  <cit> , while others can only identify perfect ssrs such as ssrit  <cit>  and misa  <cit> .

theoretically, the frequency of di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide repeats should be in turn decreased. however, trinucleotide repeat unit is the most dominant ssrs, followed by di-, tetra-, hexa-, and pentanucleotide repeat units . it is consistent with the results reported for other plant species  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  the most dominant di- and trinucleotide repeat motifs are ag/ct  and aag/ctt , respectively. these results are in agreement with that of morgante et al  <cit> , kumpatla et al  <cit> , and toth et al  <cit> . interestingly, there are only three ccg/cgg trinucleotide repeats in epimedium, which is the most predominant in monocots  <cit> . our results strongly support and extend the notion of rarity of the ccg/cgg repeat units in a large number of dicotyledonous plants   <cit> . these might be resulted from the high gc content and consequent codon usage bias in monocots  <cit> . selection might also be against the ccg/cgg repeat unit because of the requirements of the splicing machinery  <cit> . long ccg/cgg sequences could compete splicing machinery components and give rise to inadequate splicing. moreover, ccg/cgg repeats, might form potential higher structures such as hairpin and quadruplex, and thus affect the efficiency and accuracy of splicing and influence the formation of mature mrna  <cit> .

primer designing for est-ssrs
in this study, attempt of diagnosing transferability have been performed by  <dig> est-ssr primer pairs designed according to e. sagittatum ests. unfortunately, seven and four primer pairs fail to transfer in epimedium and basal eudicot, respectively, which might be due to primer across splice sites, the presence of large introns in genomic sequence, or primer derived from a chimeric or questionable consensuses sequence  <cit> . some primer pairs succeed in amplifying in some species while fail in other species, suggesting that null alleles exist. null alleles might be resulted from some mutations, including the deletion of microsatellites, and indels or substitution in primer binding sites  <cit> . in addition, the observed sizes of pcr products in epimedium species deviate frequently from the expected product sizes according to the est sequences. for instance, polymorphic bands amplified by esesp <dig>  esesp <dig>  and esesp <dig> are larger than the expected sizes. it might be due to the presence of introns in the corresponding genomic regions  <cit>  and/or variation in the repeat numbers.

the est-ssr transferability in genus epimedium
in the present study, transferability of est-ssrs derived from e. sagittatum is high  across  <dig> species in genus epimedium. the high transferability of est-ssrs is also reported in other plants. for instance, 90% est-ssrs in citrus clementia can be transferred successfully to ten citrus species and three related genera  <cit> , and 89% est-ssrs in medicago truncatula succeed in transferring to eight genotypes  <cit> . about 92% festuca arundinacea est-ssr primer pairs can produce characteristic ssr bands in at least one of the six related species  <cit> . numerous studies have also demonstrated that est-ssrs possess higher transferability due to the conservation characteristics of est-ssrs when compared with ssrs derived from genomic libraries  <cit> . in genus epimedium, the transferability of genomic ssrs derived from e. sagittatum  <cit>  and e. koreanum  <cit>  ranges from  <dig> % to  <dig> % and from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, respectively. genomic ssrs isolated from e. brevicornu also possess low transferability ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % across other four medicinal epimedium species  <cit> . comparing with the high transferability of est-ssrs , the transferability of epimedium genomic ssrs is remarkably lower.

CONCLUSIONS
a large-scale est dataset with  <dig>  consensuses derived from e. sagittatum is reported in this study. a total of  <dig>  sequences has been successfully annotated with go terms based on the known sequences, and part of unique sequences are involved in the flavonoid metabolic pathway, which would facilitate deciphering the molecular mechanism of secondary metabolism in epimedium. based on this est dataset,  <dig>  are exploited by misa software and  <dig> primer pairs are randomly selected for detecting transferability. the transferability of e. sagittatum est-ssrs is up to  <dig> % and there are ~ <dig> est-ssr markers transferable in genus epimedium for further genetic studies. ho and he range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and the number of alleles per locus ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig>  alleles. these results suggest that the major germplasm of epimedium show high genetic diversity. due to the nature of est-ssrs with high transferability and genomic ssrs with high polymorphism and both locating in different regions across whole genomes, combination of est-ssrs derived from this study and genomic ssrs developed in our lab will be a powerful resource for molecular taxonomic study in genus epimedium and constructing genetic maps. in addition, est-ssrs tend to concentrate in the gene-rich regions, suggesting that part of est-ssrs can be exploited for the use of mas benefiting for epimedium molecular breeding in the future. therefore, the set of est-ssrs developed in the present study is a promising resource for the related studies of epimedium. in a word, epimedium est dataset is a valuable resource for studies in the fields of taxonomy, mas, and secondary metabolism in genus epimedium.
