BACKGROUND
the discovery of monoclonal antibody technology  <cit>  stimulated rapid development of targeted therapies against cancer. the use of monoclonal antibodies as a drug delivery vehicles, or trigger for human immune response is already an accepted method for therapeutic treatment of patients in modern clinical oncology  <cit> . however, initially promising mouse monoclonal antibodies induced development of anti-mouse immune antibody response  in patients under repeated monoclonal antibody administration, thus limiting their application  <cit> . recombinant dna technology provides a cheap, useful alternative to monoclonal antibody production, allowing generation of large human recombinant antibody libraries displayed on the surface of filamentous phage and selection of specific human antibodies against desirable targets, useful for therapy  <cit> . moreover, phage display also enables affinity maturation of antibodies in vitro through construction of mutant antibody libraries, giving clones of greater affinity  <cit> .

the possibility of finding high-affinity binders in a recombinant antibody library depends on its quality, which is dependent on several factors, such as library size, diversity and source of immunoglobulin genes. it is known that various lymphoid tissues from immunized or nonimmunized donors, such as peripheral blood lymphocytes  <cit> , spleen and bone marrow  <cit>  and even metastasized or drained lymph node tissue from individuals with tumors  <cit>  may serve as a source of specific antibody repertoire. although naïve antibody libraries are more diverse and lead to isolation of antibodies with broad specificities, it is reasonable to suggest that construction of a recombinant antibody library from the immunoglobulin repertoire of someone affected by tumor can provide antibody fragments of higher binding affinity against specific tumor antigens. early evidence that tumor-infiltrating b lymphocyte -derived antibodies may also recognize tumor cells was obtained in the following ways: by production of human hybridomas derived from til, able to secrete tumor-specific antibodies  <cit> ; b cell expansion of til from human tumor biopsies  <cit> ; b cell expansion of melanoma-derived til, and following cloning of the scfv antibody with specific melanoma reactivity from single b cell clone  <cit> ; and subcutaneous transplantation of human lung cancer tissue in immunodeficient mice  <cit> , all of which suggest a specific function of til-b in the tumor. recently, a rare type of breast cancer, classified as medullary carcinoma , characterized by strong lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates correlated with improved prognosis and patient survival, and cervical carcinoma, were investigated to understand the nature of tumor-infiltrated b lymphocytes through analysis of til-derived ig repertoire  <cit> . a study of the molecular structure of variable antibody regions gave evidence of antigen-driven humoral immune responses in medullary breast carcinomas, as well as in cervical tumors. the oligoclonal predominance found in antibody genes derived from til indicated possible clonal selection of the ig molecules against specific neoantigens overexpressing, or specifically expressing, in tumor tissue. despite the very strong above-mentioned indications that tumor tissue is infiltrated with activated b cells, which may serve as a source of tumor-specific antibodies, in panning experiments performed against purified known tumor antigens, living tumor cells or frozen tissue sections, several research groups failed to select either a specific antibody discriminating between tumor and normal cells, or one reactive with cell-surface tumor antigens  <cit> . only later, two different groups managed to identify specific antibodies recognizing tumor cells from this type of phage-display libraries  <cit> .

despite the limited success obtained by other research groups exploring the recombinant antibody libraries derived from til-b, we generated a series of til-b-based scfv libraries from breast tumors. we panned them, along with a peripheral blood lymphocyte -derived library from a single breast tumor patient, on living mcf <dig> breast carcinoma cells, as well as on three purified tumor surface antigens, i.e., cea   <cit> , muc <dig>   <cit>  and ed-b domain of fibronectin  <cit> . a novel pkm <dig> vector  <cit> , designed to provide relatively low expression levels of recombinant antibodies, thus reducing biological bias for their expression in e. coli, was used for generation of antibody libraries in scfv format. cell-based panning and selection of scfv antibodies against purified antigens provided, in each case, a panel of highly specific antibodies from til- or pbl-derived scfv libraries.

scfv library construction
the antibody gene repertoire was amplified using a set of primers designed for amplification of vh and vl antibody domains  <cit> , and scfv fragments were assembled in vitro as described earlier  <cit> . the scfv fragments were then amplified by pcr with appropriate extension primers, incorporating ncoi, noti restriction sites, facilitating the cloning of the scfv genes into the pkm <dig> vector. the resulting pcr products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis . the dna fragments were digested with ncoi/noti and inserted into the pkm <dig> digested vector. ligated dna was used to transform competent dh5αf' bacterial cells  hsdr <dig> reca <dig> enda1gyra <dig> thi- <dig> rela <dig> f' ) by electroporation. the transformed cells were plated on  <dig> agar dishes , containing lb agar,  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose. after overnight incubation at 37°c, bacterial colonies were scraped from the plates and resuspended in lb, containing 10% glycerol. aliquots of this cell suspension were stored at -80°c and used for phage amplification.

phage amplification
forty μl of scraped bacterial cells were incubated in  <dig> ml of lb containing ampicillin and 1% glucose until o.d. =  <dig> . the bacteria were collected by centrifuging and resuspended in  <dig> ml of lb with ampicillin without glucose. about  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu  of helper m13k <dig> were added to each ml of cell suspension, incubated for  <dig> min at 37°c without agitation and for another two h in a shaker. kanamycin was added to obtain a final concentration of  <dig> μg/ml, and cells were incubated overnight at 32°c. phage was purified according to standard peg/nacl precipitation  <cit> .

cell-based selection of antibodies from phage-displayed library
mcf <dig> semiconfluent cells  were rinsed three times with pbs and incubated with  <dig> ml of  <dig> mm edta in pbs for  <dig> min at 37°c. ten ml of pbs containing  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> were added to the cells, which were accurately collected by pipetting. the cells were pelleted by centrifuging, washed once with  <dig> ml of pbs/mgcl <dig> and finally resuspended in  <dig> ml of freshly prepared blocking buffer: 4% non-fat dry milk,  <dig> % tween  <dig>   <dig> ×  <dig> pfu of f <dig> uv-killed phage in pbs. the cells were blocked for  <dig> min at rt on rotating wheel, then collected and incubated for one h at 37°c on the wheel with about  <dig> ×  <dig> tu  of freshly amplified scfv antibody library in  <dig> ml of blocking buffer. the cells were washed five times with pbs/tween and the bound phage eluted by adding  <dig> μl of  <dig>  m hcl, ph  <dig>  . cell suspension was incubated with elution solution for ten min at rt, neutralized by  <dig> μl of  <dig> m tris-hcl, ph  <dig> , and used for infection of bacterial cells. the bacteria were plated on two lb agar dishes , containing  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose. scraped bacteria were used for phage amplification.

affinity selection on purified protein targets
cea and recombinant muc <dig> were biotinylated as described earlier  <cit> . about  <dig> ×  <dig> tu of freshly amplified scfv antibody libraries were preincubated with  <dig> μl of ad <dig> bacterial extract in blocking buffer for  <dig> min at 37°c. twenty μg of a biotinylated protein  were added to the reaction mixture and incubated for another h at 37°c under gentle agitation. the bound phage was captured by using streptavidin-coated dynabeads m- <dig>  according to manufacturer's instructions, washed five to ten times with pbs/tween, then eluted and amplified as above.

elisa
the cells were grown in a 96-well plate until almost confluent. after discarding the growth medium,  <dig> μl of freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde  in pbs were rapidly added to well and incubated for ten min. the fixing solution was removed by pipetting and cells were incubated with blocking buffer  for  <dig> min at rt. peg-purified phage in blocking buffer  was added to the cells and incubated for one h at 37°c under gentle agitation. the cells were washed three times with washing buffer  and incubated with an anti-m <dig> hrp-conjugated antibody  for  <dig> min at 37°c. the cells were washed five times and the immunoreaction developed by incubation with tmb liquid substrate  for  <dig> min at rt and stopped by the addition of  <dig> μl  <dig> m h2so <dig>  the results were expressed as the difference between absorbances at  <dig> and  <dig> nm, determined by an automated elisa reader. all assays were done in triplicate.

to test phage-antibody reactivity against soluble antigens, a protein solution at a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml in  <dig> mm nahco <dig>  ph  <dig> , were coated overnight at 4°c into multiwell plates . after discarding coating solution, plates were blocked for one h at 37°c with blocking buffer . plates were washed several times with washing buffer . peg-purified phage in blocking buffer  was added to each well and incubated for one h at 37°c. the immunoreaction was developed as above. all assays were done in duplicate.

soluble antibody production
once identified, the scfv genes were recloned in pkm <dig>  <cit>  for production of soluble antibodies. this plasmid directs protein expression under the control of the lacp promoter. the unique ncoi and noti cloning sites facilitate insertion of antibody genes, allowing for expression of single-chain antibodies as fusion to the leader peptide and the first two amino acids of bacterial alkaline phosphatase, at the antibody's amino terminus, and as fusion to flag/6his-tail at the antibody's carboxy terminus.

a single colony was inoculated into  <dig> ml of lb containing  <dig> μg/ml ap and 2% glucose. the culture was grown at 37°c for two to three h until o.d. <dig> =  <dig> . the cells were recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in  <dig> ml of fresh lb with  <dig> μg/ml ap,  <dig> mm iptg,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>  and incubated overnight at 30–32°c. bacterial cells were pelleted and then resuspended in  <dig>  ml of pbs. after three cycles of freeze and thaw, cell debris was pelleted and the soluble antibodies purified from the resulting supernatant by using his-select hf nickel affinity gel , according to manufacturer's instructions.

immunohistochemistry
to study the specificity of scfvs, about  <dig> cells were spun down onto each poly-l-lysine-covered glass slide. the slides were processed according to standard protocols and binding revealed using vectastain abc . briefly, the cells were fixed for  <dig> min with 4% formaldehyde at rt or for ten min with cold methanol at -20°c, while endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% h2o <dig> in pbs for five min. after two washes with pbs, slides were blocked with 3% bsa in pbs for  <dig> min and then incubated for one h at rt . the slides were washed again and incubated for one h at rt with  <dig> μg/ml anti-flag hrp-conjugated monoclonal antibody . after further washing, the slides were incubated with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex for  <dig> min. finally, dab substrate  was added and the reaction was stopped after two to ten min by washing in tap water. counterstaining was performed with mayer's hematoxylin  for ten s. then the slides were dehydrated by emerging into 75%, 80%, 95% and 100% ethanol solutions and clarified twice for two min in histolemon .

before processing the non-fixed cells, the slides were air-dried for ten min and then used for staining.

frozen tissue slices were thawed for one h at rt and hydrated with pbs. the slices were fixed with acetone for  <dig> min at rt and blocked with blocking solution  for  <dig> min. the scfv antibodies, in a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml in blocking solution, were added to the slides for  <dig> min. the slides were then processed as above.

immunofluorescence staining
the cells were grown in a 24-well plate for cell culture , fixed with  <dig> % formaldehyde in pbs for  <dig> min at rt and blocked with 3% bsa in pbs for one h at rt. peg-purified phage in 1% bsa/pbs was added to the cells and incubated for one h under gentle agitation at 37°c. the cells were washed three times with 1% bsa in pbs and incubated with an anti-m <dig> mouse monoclonal antibody  for  <dig> min at 37°c. the cells were washed as above and then incubated with an fitc-conjugated anti-mouse goat polyclonal antibody  at a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml for  <dig> min at 37°c under gentle agitation. after the last incubation, cells were washed five times, dried in the dark, mounted with vectashield medium  and cover glasses and analyzed using an inverted fluorescence microscope.

fluorescence-activated cell sorting  analysis
one hundred μl of phage suspension in te  were preincubated with  <dig> μl of 4% non-fat dried milk in pbs buffer for  <dig> min at rt under agitation to block unspecific binding. the phage sample was then added to  <dig> ×  <dig> human cells in  <dig> μl of 1% bsa in pbs and incubated for one h at 4°c in a 96-well plate. after two washings with 1% bsa in pbs, a murine anti-m <dig> monoclonal antibody, diluted 1/ <dig>  was added to cell pellet and incubated for  <dig> min at 4°c. afterwards, the cells were washed as above and incubated with an anti-mouse pe-conjugated antibody , diluted 1/ <dig>  for another  <dig> min at rt. after staining, the cell samples were washed twice. specific binding of the phage particles displaying scfv antibodies was measured by facsarray or facscalibur instrument . viability detection was performed by adding  <dig>  μl of 7-aad staining solution  to each sample.

for facs analysis with soluble scfv antibodies about  <dig> ×  <dig> cells were resuspended in 1% bsa in pbs and incubated, first with  <dig> μg of a purified scfv primary antibody, then with an anti-flag antibody  and finally with a fitc-labeled anti-mouse-igg , following manufacturer's instructions. incubation was performed for 30– <dig> min in ice-water bath, the cells washed between steps with 1% bsa in pbs.

in case of intracellular staining, the cells were fixed by 4% cold formaldehyde in pbs for  <dig> min in ice and resuspended in 1% bsa,  <dig> % saponin  in pbs. the cells were processed as above and washed between the steps with 1% bsa,  <dig> % saponin in pbs. final washings were performed reducing the amount of saponin from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and then 0%. the samples resuspended in pbs were then acquired and analyzed by cell quest software on facscalibur.

RESULTS
characterization of the lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltrates in breast tumor samples
we examined ten tumor specimens from breast cancer patients  for presence and nature of til-b, first by pcr amplification of vj antibody segments  and then by a comparison between igg and iga antibody classes presenting in tumor samples.

we analyzed the expression patterns of the antibody fragment genes by semi-quantitative pcr from smart cdna template. a panel of cdnas from ten breast carcinomas and samples of normal breast, testis and peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors were normalized by pcr amplification of β-actin, a housekeeping gene . hypervariable heavy chain antibody regions j) were amplified as described in materials and methods. after analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis, the pcr samples were also fractionated by high resolving 10% page . in applying this technique, we observed that seven of ten tumor-derived samples contained various discrete bands, characterizing oligoclonality of the immune response in these patients, while the well-amplified normal breast and peripheral lymphocyte dna fragments did not contain intensive bands but formed a smear, consisting of bands of differing length. the observed oligoclonality of the immunoglobulins did not correlate with the age of the patients.

to analyze antibody subclass distribution we amplified ig genes from breast carcinoma cdna and normal breast, using subclass-specific primers. in agreement with the previous assay, the  <dig> cdna tumor samples without oligoclonal bands in pcr-amplified vj regions, had, in this test, a prevalence of iga in comparison with igg <dig> and igg <dig> bands, just as in a sample of normal breast where iga generally represents the major ig class  <cit> . on the other hand, samples showing oligoclonality in the first assay contained igg <dig>  or both igg <dig> and igg <dig> as dominant antibody bands, in contrast to normal breast. fig. 1c shows four more characteristic examples, along with normal breast sample. the cdna samples from patients b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> were chosen for library construction. sample b <dig>  which did not provide strong oligoclonal bands, nevertheless showed a prevalence of igg antibodies .

oligoclonality of til-b-derived antibodies in breast cancer patients was confirmed by sequencing
we chose two cdna samples  that gave the strongest sharp bands in vj test, for sequencing analysis. the nucleotide sequences of  <dig> and  <dig> randomly picked clones containing heavy chain genes deriving from b <dig> and b <dig> cdna, respectively, were determined and their amino acid sequences deduced . all  <dig> clones encoded in-frame correctly organized heavy chains. the antibody clones, b92a and b93a, occurring more frequently, contained vj regions of a length exactly corresponding to the strong bands observed earlier in fig. 1b  , thus indicating that both pcr amplification with variable heavy chain primers and the cloning step do not introduce any particular bias interfering with heavy chain frequencies in generated libraries.

six somatic mutations, identified in antibody fragments isolated many times, were localized within variable cdrs of vhs of the same specificity, while only one mutation was found in frs of  <dig> heavy chain sequences . therefore, the oligoclonality of the antibody repertoire, deriving from a tumor microenvironment, is a natural immune response occurring within tumor tissue driven by tumor antigens, and not an artifact introduced by pcr amplification.

library construction
four scfv antibody libraries were generated using seven cdna samples, characterized by oligoclonality of the immune response . only the scfvec <dig> library was constructed earlier  <cit>  from peripheral blood lymphocytes, obtained from a single patient with advanced breast cancer.

we used a novel pkm <dig> vector for construction of the libraries  <cit> . this vector is characterized by the following features:  use of the phoa leader peptide  guarantees efficient membrane assembly and processing of recombinant antibodies;  relatively low antibody expression levels prevent abundant protein production, reducing biological bias for harmful antibodies that may affect bacterial growth or be toxic for host bacteria, thus increasing the actual complexity of a generated library;  fusion of scfv antibody to deleted gpiii protein improves antibody display efficiency in this system.

selection of specific antitumor antibodies from phage display libraries generated from til-b and pbl
we examined the possibility of selecting specific antibody fragments from phage libraries against common cancer antigens available in our lab, including ed-b domain of fibronectin, muc <dig> epithelial mucin, and cea. under conditions described in materials and methods, a mixture of four til-derived scfv libraries  and the scfvec <dig> library were panned separately against three protein targets in several rounds. in every case, we observed that phage pools were positive against the selecting antigen already after the second and third panning rounds . randomly picked clones from pools of phage after the third round of selection were tested in elisa for binding reactivity against the respective antigens. positive clones were analyzed by dna fingerprinting using haeiii and alui double digestion and all the various antibody clones were sequenced. table  <dig> summarizes the clone analysis data. fig.  <dig> represents elisa of single scfv phages selected on purified antigens.

cell-based selection of tumor-specific antibodies
we tested functionality of a single til-derived library  by selecting breast cancer-specific antibodies through cell-based panning on living mcf <dig> breast carcinoma cells. four additional libraries, including scfvb <dig>  scfvb <dig>  scfvmix and scfvec <dig>  were pooled together  and panned in similar fashion. four or five selection rounds on the tumor cells were necessary for mixlib and scfvb <dig> libraries, respectively, in order to obtain phage pools enriched by specific cell binders . then, randomly picked clones were analyzed by pcr for presence of complete scfv antibody genes. the full-length scfv phage clones were tested by cell-based elisa, and analyzed by dna fingerprinting . table  <dig> summarizes clone analysis data. all different positive clones were sequenced. amino acid sequences, deduced from dna sequences, confirmed correct, in-frame antibody structures.

the reactivity and specificity of cell-selected antibodies were verified by elisa on two breast carcinoma cell lines: mcf <dig>  mda-mb- <dig> and normal cells, as negative controls: mcf10-2a , hff  . of ten different antibodies belonging to seven specificity groups , nine scfvs specifically bind to breast carcinoma cells, while the b96/4f antibody alone also binds to normal epithelial cells as well.

cell-selected antibodies derived from til
mix7-mix <dig> scfv antibodies were selected from a mixture of pbl and til-derived libraries. we investigated the origin of these antibodies to see which type of library functions better under equal selection conditions. one μl of each amplified library was used as template for pcr amplification with a pair of oligonucleotide primers specific for each antibody . this analysis shows that five tested scfv antibodies, isolated from a mixture of libraries, belong to til-derived antibodies. antibody genes of mix <dig> and mix <dig> , and mix <dig>  are believed to have a similar origin. regarding the irrelevant anti-sp <dig> antibody, selected earlier from an scfvec <dig> library  <cit> , its origin from a pbl-derived library was confirmed.

staining of tumor cells
to demonstrate the specificity of selected antibodies we examined three scfvs in soluble form  by immunohistochemical staining. these antibodies were chosen because of their good reactivity, specificity and stability in soluble form. the first staining was performed on various methanol-fixed breast carcinoma cells, including mcf <dig>  mda-mb- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> . different intensity staining was observed for all three antibodies tested, compared to the irrelevant anti-sp <dig> antibody. in the second experiment, formaldehyde-fixed or non-fixed dried cells were stained . all selected antibodies specifically stained both fixed and non-fixed carcinoma mcf <dig> cells, but did not stain normal epithelial mcf10-2a cells. however, the signal was notably stronger for non-fixed cells. weak background labeling was registered for mix <dig> when it interacted with non-fixed mcf10-2a cells. intensive staining activity of mix <dig> and mix <dig> was associated with the cell membrane, cytoplasm and nuclear membrane, while mix <dig> staining was of nuclear localization .

we also stained tumor and normal matched breast tissues, available in our laboratory, from patients b <dig> and b <dig>  all the scfvs tested strongly stained tumor cells and were negative with normal matched tissue from patient b <dig> . the irrelevant anti-sp <dig> antibody did not react with the tissue slices tested.

the binding capacity of the anti-muc <dig> antibody mb <dig> and the anti-cea antibody cb <dig> were assessed by immunofluorescence staining of tumor cells directly with phage antibodies . the mb <dig> antibody intensively stained mcf <dig> cells, known for high muc <dig> expression, and also reacted well with another breast carcinoma cell line, skbr <dig>  the cb <dig>  an anti-cea antibody, efficiently bound colon adenocarcinoma cells, lovo, expressing the carcinoembryonic antigen. no background staining for normal breast epithelium was observed. binding of the mb <dig> and cb <dig> phage-displayed scfvs was also measured by flow cytometry. according to facs analysis, the mb <dig> stained 71% of mcf <dig> and  <dig> % of scbr <dig> cells. with regard to the anti-cea cb <dig> antibody, it bound 44% of lovo cells.

all anti-mcf <dig> phage clones were tested in fluorescence staining of non-permeabilized mcf <dig> breast carcinoma cells  in comparison with normal mcf10-2a cells . all antibodies stained only a low percentage of mcf <dig> cells, probably apoptotic or dead cells. no background staining for normal breast epithelium was observed. facs analysis performed with three soluble scfv antibodies confirmed that mix antibodies react with intracellular antigens of tumoral cells .

discussion
in comparison with the nondetectable clonality of b cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes , b cells from tumor-draining lymph nodes and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes represent a much more limited ig repertoire  <cit> . about 7% of lymph node-derived, and between 18–68% of til-derived, heavy chain antibody sequences belong to clonal groups  <cit> , thus indicating both tumor-draining lymph nodes and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as promising sources of tumor-specific antibodies. in fact, identification of anti-tumor recombinant antibodies from display libraries derived from lymph nodes of cancer patients was reported in several studies, as mentioned in the introduction  <cit> . however, we found it quite difficult to obtain, as fresh surgical material, metastasized or tumor-draining lymph nodes from breast cancer patients. according to recent medical practice, the surgeon removes only a sentinel lymph node, or a small cluster of nodes , instead of removing dozens of lymph nodes as before, thus performing less invasive surgery and reducing side effects. after sentinel lymph node dissection, practically the entire node is studied for presence of micrometastasis or single cancer cells. as a result, in breast cancer surgery, the dissected node is virtually unavailable as discarded surgical material.

in this article, we examined the possibility of using primary tumors as a source of genes of antitumor antibodies, potentially useful for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. we showed, by pcr amplification of specific antibody gene regions deriving from ten primary breast tumors  of patients aged between 49– <dig> years, that seven of ten of these samples , have a prominent igg antibody expression, as compared with the iga subclass. this correlates with the oligoclonality of the hypervariable region of heavy chain antibodies, suggesting a specific immune response to tumor-expressed antigens. clonality of tumor-derived antibodies was confirmed by sequencing analysis. the great majority of the gamma heavy chains, derived from til-b of b <dig> and b <dig> patients, belong to clonal groups. the higher frequency of somatic mutations observed within cdrs vs frs in variable regions of heavy chains of the same specificity indicates that tumor-infiltrated b-cells locally produce a restricted igg repertoire, with evidence of antigen-driven maturation.

we identified a panel of tumor-specific antibodies from the described libraries; these antibodies were reactive with ed-b domain, muc <dig>  cea and mcf <dig> breast carcinoma cells used in the respective selections. it is interesting to note that, in cell-based selection, performed without a subtractive panning step on normal breast epithelium, and in contrast with numerous previously described selection protocols  <cit> , we isolated only one nonspecific scfv, which recognized normal breast epithelium as well. this probably indicates that our modest-sized til-derived libraries, despite a very restricted antibody repertoire, contain quite strong easily selectable antitumor binders. the antibodies obtained in the cell-based selection, recognized intracellular antigens, as shown by fluorescent and immunohistochemical staining, and flow cytometry analysis. this result agrees with hoogenboom's findings, which demonstrated that local humoral immune response in colorectal carcinoma patients was biased toward intracellular target antigens  <cit> . notably, that antibody selection from a mixture of pbl- and til-derived libraries clearly shows the latter to be more efficient in cell-based panning. in fact, all isolated anti-mcf <dig> single-chain antibodies appeared to be derived from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. the libraries derived from til have quite low complexity, as it was shown by random sequencing of antibody repertoire in two patients . for this reason, we presume that the efficient selection of scfvs against various antigens tested is a result of the strong antitumor profiles of such libraries and the use of a suitable combination of antibody repertoires from various patients. in order to understand how often antibodies against a single antigen occur in different til-derived repertoires, we attempted to select new anti-cea antibodies from a new mixture of libraries, this time excluding the scfvb <dig> library, since one of the anti-cea antibodies, cb <dig>  derived exactly from this library . no new antibodies were selected, indicating that patient b <dig> alone, among seven patients, had local immune response against the cea antigen. however, in order to reach a definitive conclusion on the capacity of til-derived libraries, it would be interesting to compare selection against the same antigens from til- and pbl-derived libraries from the same patient. unfortunately, we have no such matched libraries.

to sum up, til-derived libraries gave good results in all performed selections, providing a panel of human tumor-specific antibodies which recognize tumor cell surface and intracellular antigens.

as mentioned in the background, the selection of specific antitumor antibodies from til-derived phage-display libraries often failed, while an alternative approach, based on a phage-expression tumor-derived library and direct plaque screening protocols that avoided the limitations of a phage display system, allowed wu and colleagues  <cit>  to isolate multiple antibodies that specifically bind cultured tumor cells. in the present study, we applied a novel pkm <dig> vector for display of recombinant antibodies in single-chain format. we believe the application of the improved display system permitted us to generate the functional tumor-derived phage-display libraries, giving rise to various antibodies that recognize tumor cell antigens.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that natural immune responses to tumor-related antigens occur quite frequently in patients with breast cancer, not only in histologically-defined mcb. tumor samples as small as  <dig>  g, obtained as surgical material, can be exploited as an appropriate source for generation of recombinant phage display libraries enriched for tumor-specific antibodies. isolation of a panel of antitumor scfvs through selection against desirable protein targets, as well as against living breast carcinoma cells, shows this approach to be very promising for development of human antibodies, potentially useful for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

moreover, investigation of the protein targets eliciting production of tumor cell-specific antibodies in a tumor microenvironment may  provide important information about individual immunoreactivity of a given patient, affording a prognostic value;  open an ample perspective for discovery of novel tumor-specific antigens.
