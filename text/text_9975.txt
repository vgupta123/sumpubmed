BACKGROUND
in veterinary medicine, the mainstay of drug therapy for the alleviation of clinical signs associated with osteoarthritis  or degenerative joint disease -associated pain in dogs are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . this may be partly due to the fact that there are no other classes of drug approved by the food and drug administration – center for veterinary medicine  for the control of djd-associated pain in dogs. despite some data to indicate efficacy of other drugs for oa-associated pain in dogs  <cit> , evidence-based data indicates nsaids are currently considered the most effective therapy for djd-associated pain  <cit> . however, nsaids are not always sufficiently effective  <cit>  and concerns about side effects result in a large unmet need in the treatment of canine djd-associated pain.

targeting nerve growth factor  has emerged as a potentially useful therapeutic avenue for pain control. ngf was originally identified as a critical factor for the development and maintenance of sensory and sympathetic neurons in the developing nervous system. however, it is now clear that the dependence of these neurons on ngf for survival is restricted to a brief time during development and in the adult system, ngf has an important role in pro-nociception via its effects on the ngf-specific tyrosine kinase receptor  .

ngf binds to the high-affinity ngf-specific trka which results in autophosphorylation of the trka intracellular domain and activation of subsequent downstream signaling cascades . this results in post-translational changes in the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor  <dig>  cation channel, increasing its excitability, and further upregulation of other proteins that increase the excitability of the primary afferent fiber  <cit> . ngf also activates mast cells, and thus further sensitizes neurons as a result of the products released by mast cells  <cit> . given its role in nociception, various ways of preventing activation of trka have been explored, including removing free ngf, preventing ngf binding to trka or preventing activation of trka  <cit> . of these approaches, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies  targeting ngf  have been developed first.

inhibition of ngf function via anti-ngf antibodies markedly reduces hyperalgesia and behavioral indicators of pain in various animal models of inflammatory arthritis  <cit> . in human clinical studies, several anti-ngf mabs have been evaluated and been shown to reduce pain and improve function in patients with oa  <cit> .

however, it is apparent that pain disorders display significant differences in their responsiveness to anti-ngf agents  <cit> .

recently, a canine-specific mab against ngf  was described and reported to have high affinity and potency, no effector activity, a long half-life and low immunogenic potential  <cit> . one recent report suggested that this caninised anti-ngf mab may provide alleviation of the signs of pain in dogs with osteoarthritis  <cit> . in that study, all dogs received the mab with the time of administration being randomized and blinded. although this innovative design provides initial information on the efficacy of this ngf-neutralizing antibody, the pervasive placebo effect known to occur in canine oa trials  <cit>  and the lack of objective measures used indicated that a more comprehensive study design was desirable to fully assess the potential utility of this therapeutic  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to further assess the pain alleviating and function enhancing effects of nv- <dig> in dogs with djd-associated pain and mobility impairment. our hypothesis was that a single treatment of nv- <dig> would decrease pain and improve mobility in dogs with djd-associated pain for  <dig> weeks, as measured by owner-completed clinical metrology instruments  and objectively measured activity. specifically, using a randomized, parallel group, stratified, double masked, placebo controlled, proof of principle clinical pilot study design we aimed to assess the pain-alleviating and activity enhancing effects of nv- <dig> in dogs with djd-associated pain, using the primary outcome measures of cmis and actimetry data. in addition, we aimed to evaluate the effects of nv- <dig> on index joint pain, total joint pain score, owner-assessed side effects, hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis as secondary outcome measures.

laboratory values
at screening , there were a few notable differences between the groups in hematology parameters, with the placebo group having higher white blood cell count, higher hemoglobin, higher hematocrit and lower mean corpuscular volume. these differences were not statistically significant. additionally, red blood cell count values were significantly higher in the placebo group .

at d <dig>  there were several significant differences between the groups in hematology parameters: red blood cell count values were significantly higher in the placebo group ; hemoglobin was significantly higher in the placebo group ; hematocrit was significantly higher in the placebo group ; packed cell volume was higher in the placebo group .

to further evaluate these findings, these values were examined for significant within group changes. the only significant change within groups was a significant decrease in packed cell volume in the nv- <dig> group . no values in any dog were considered clinically significant, and all values remained within the reference range. in the nv- <dig> group, 9/ <dig> had a drop in pcv, compared to 5/ <dig> in the placebo group. the median values for each group at each time point are documented in table  <dig> table  <dig>

anti-nv- <dig> antibody assay in canine plasma
using a competition binding elisa format, the presence of anti-nv- <dig> neutralising antibody responses was evident if the concentration of nv- <dig> measured in the presence of plasma from nv-01-treated dogs was markedly lower than the concentration measured in the presence of plasma from placebo-treated dogs or in the absence of plasma. by this assay, no neutralizing antibodies  were detected in the d <dig> plasma of any dogs tested .

discussion
using a randomized, parallel group, stratified, double masked, placebo controlled, proof of principle clinical study design we supported our hypothesis that a single treatment of nv- <dig> would decrease pain and improve mobility over a 4-week time period in dogs with djd-associated pain, as measured by owner-completed clinical metrology instruments  and objectively measured activity.

these positive findings pertain to dogs where owners have noticed activity or mobility impairment, and in which subsequent diagnostics confirmed the presence of djd. we believe our findings are transferable to the general canine population suffering from djd-associated pain. djd is an umbrella term describing degeneration of synovial and cartilaginous joints  <cit> . many studies describe the inclusion of dogs with only oa   <cit> , however it is our experience  <cit>  that dogs with appendicular oa commonly have pain on palpation of regions of the spine, and radiographic evidence of axial skeleton djd . therefore, in order to test nv- <dig> in a relevant population, we included dogs with appendicular djd or spinal djd, or both. all of the dogs in our study had painful appendicular djd, but in  <dig> of  <dig> dogs the index area was in the axial skeleton. all of these dogs had radiographic evidence of facet joint degeneration , but also evidence of intervertebral disk degeneration or spinal spondylosis. it is unknown whether the pain elicited on palpation was a result of facet joint oa or intervertebral disk joint djd. regardless, we believe this cohort of dogs reflects the dogs presenting in practice for musculoskeletal pain due to djd, and we believe the term ‘djd-associated pain’ more accurately reflects these individuals. we were careful to exclude dogs with any neurological deficits. unlike the majority of participants in the human clinical studies of anti-ngf mabs  <cit> , we did not target dogs that had failed other treatments, or where previous treatments were not appropriately effective.

force platforms or pressure-sensitive walkways are often used as an objective measure of changes in limb use in relation to joint pain in dogs  <cit> . however, many dogs present with multiple joint oa and only a small subset of the canine population with oa has obvious asymmetry in limb use, which is optimal for kinetic evaluation  <cit> . we therefore used global measures that pertain to pain relief – owner-completed clinical metrology instruments and an objective measure of activity – rather than focus on measures of limb use.

the cmis we used have all undergone various degrees of validation , with the cbpi and the load being the most evaluated and considered the most valid  <cit> . the csom has not been formally tested for criterion validity, but has shown responsiveness with known analgesics  <cit>  and a putative analgesic  <cit> . in the present study, all the cmi data led to similar conclusions, with the csom and load appearing most sensitive to changes associated with treatment. we found significant positive effects of treatment, and this was surprising given the relatively small numbers of dogs. recent work  <cit>  found ‘strong’ correlation between the load and the cbpi pss and pis. however, it was clear in that study there was not perfect correlation, suggesting that the two cmis are measuring slightly different aspects and this is supported by our current data. currently, it is not known exactly how different cmis vary in what they are assessing. what is clear is that despite attempts to validate the cmis with objective measures of limb use  or activity , only weak correlation is found for ground reaction forces  or accelerometry  <cit> . one explanation may be that the cmis are not optimally designed. however, the fact they show robust responsiveness to treatment in masked studies, suggests cmis, grfs and accelerometry are measuring different aspects of outcome. this supports the inclusion of these different measures of outcome in clinical studies. an important question that remains unanswered is ‘which of these outcome measures is most relevant to the dog?’ it is becoming increasingly recognized that the different outcome measures are assessing different aspects of the multifactorial pain experience.

overall, the degree of reduction in pain over placebo across the cmis was approximately 30% , which is considered clinically relevant in human medicine. when evaluating the effect size of the change in load, we found a large effect size at both d <dig> and d <dig>  together, our data suggest a relatively large effect of nv- <dig>  but could also represent type i error. further studies in larger numbers of dogs are needed to confirm the current findings.

conversion of cmi data to success/failure has been recently described for the cbpi  <cit>  and the csom  <cit> . we used these recommendations, and found significantly more treatment successes at d <dig> using the csom. this was surprising because to detect significant differences using success/failure analysis requires large differences between the groups or large numbers of animals, and is not usually seen with relatively small group sizes. additionally, the distribution of success/failure for the cbpi  and csom  was very similar to previous studies using the nsaids carprofen  and meloxicam  the present cmi data suggests the efficacy of a single dose of nv- <dig> is at least identical to that of daily nsaid administration. currently, the duration of action is unknown, and further work is needed to determine this.

treatment-related effects on activity as measured by accelerometry were seen, particularly for the day-time period. the accelerometers we used have been shown to be a surrogate measure of dog activity  <cit> , and have successfully detected changes in activity related to nsaid administration in clinical studies in dogs  <cit> . activity is highly variable from day to day both within and between dogs  <cit> . given this variability, we elected to assess a change in activity over time within individual dogs, using 7-day blocks of time  <cit> . we detected improved day-time activity in the nv- <dig> group over the placebo group. looking at the 24-hour profile of activity at baseline, it might have been expected to see changes in the peaks of activity. however, the peaks of activity  are likely defined by owner activity and owner interaction with the dogs. conversely, the activity during the daytime  may be more representative of spontaneous activity. little work has been performed on how analgesic therapy changes the profile of activity over the day, and further work, including capturing owner schedules, is required to better understand this.

the dose used was based on earlier work with nv- <dig> that suggested  <dig> mcg/kg showed analgesic efficacy in the kaolin model of inflammation  <cit> . our current data appears to confirm the efficacy of nv- <dig> and indicates that efficacy lasts for at least  <dig> days following a single injection. no neutralizing antibodies were detected in any of the dogs treated with nv- <dig>  that is, no antibodies to the anti-ngf antibodies. further work is needed to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of nv- <dig> and the duration of efficacy from a single dose. in the human clinical trials, several versions of anti-ngf mabs have been evaluated, and overall, efficacy is detected within  <dig> weeks and appears to last at least  <dig> weeks  <cit> . the majority of patients enrolled into these human clinical trials are patients in which pain was not adequately controlled by nsaids and/or opioids, which is in contrast to our canine study inclusion criteria. of interest, all the basic studies on anti-ngf were performed in rodent models of inflammatory arthritis or inflammatory pain. no studies have been performed in rodent models of oa or non-inflammatory djd, making this current study the first placebo-controlled evaluation of anti-ngf in a non-human model of non-inflammatory djd. if further work confirms the efficacy of nv- <dig> in dogs with djd-associated pain, it will be a demonstration of the predictive validity of the ‘spontaneously –occurring canine djd model’  for human conditions.

the present study was not appropriately powered to assess the potential for side effects. in human clinical trials, two main types of side effects have been seen with anti-ngf mabs – neurological effects and effects on the progression of oa  <cit> . we performed a neurological evaluation of all dogs at  <dig> days following treatment and did not detect any neurological abnormalities. many of the neurological side effects in people were peripheral sensory symptoms, primarily paresthesia, hypoesthesia and hyperesthesia. it is unlikely these would be detected in canine patients by a detailed clinical neurological evaluation such as we performed. future work should use quantitative sensory testing  methods that are being developed in dogs  <cit>  to more completely evaluate sensory function changes. human clinical studies of anti-ngf mabs were halted by the fda due to a signal of adverse events related to rapidly progressing osteoarthritis  in approximately 1% of treated patients. this occurred in diseased joints, but there were also some cases that occurred in previously asymptomatic joints  <cit> . the mechanism of this rpoa is not understood. we saw no cases of worsening joint pain in our study, but a significantly larger cohort of treated dogs would be needed to detect whether or not a similar side effect is seen in dogs. there is no data in veterinary medicine on the normal rate of progression of oa in dogs, and this should be an area targeted with clinical research prior to the advent of anti-ngf mabs in veterinary medicine. in the present study, we did detect a statistically significant, but clinically benign, change in packed cell volume in the nv- <dig> treated group. the reason for this is unknown, and it has not been reported in human studies. this should be evaluated carefully in subsequent studies.

CONCLUSIONS
this pilot, masked, placebo-controlled clinical study suggests efficacy of nv- <dig>  a monoclonal canine-specific antibody against nerve growth factor, in reducing spontaneous djd-associated pain and improving mobility in dogs. owner-assessed indices of pain and mobility were significantly improved in nv- <dig> treated dogs compared to placebo, and objectively measured activity increased significantly more in the nv- <dig> treated dogs during the daytime period.
