BACKGROUND
in bacteria, replication fork arrest is mainly repaired by homologous recombination  <cit> . when such a recombination event occurs an odd number of times in one dna replication event of circular chromosomes, the replicated chromosome is not properly segregated into two daughter chromosomes but instead produces a concatenated dimer  <cit> . therefore, many bacteria harbor highly conserved chromosome dimer resolution  machinery to separate the dimer chromosome into two monomer daughter chromosomes.

in escherichia coli, chromosome dimers are resolved by two tyrosine recombinases, xerc and xerd, by the addition of a crossover at a specific 28-bp sequence called the dif site, which is located in the replication termination region of the chromosome  <cit> . the dif sequence contains a pair of palindromic sequence motifs that correspond to the binding domains of xerc and xerd. the reaction is coordinated to the last stages of cell division by an essential cell division protein, ftsk, which functions as a septum-located dna translocase  <cit> . ftsk moves along the chromosome unidirectionally towards the dif sequence, thanks to polar and orientated sequences, the kops  <cit> . cdr is initiated when ftsk reaches dif and its extreme c-terminal domain directly interacts with the c-terminal domain of xerd  <cit> . the dif/xercd chromosome dimer resolution system seems widely conserved. in vivo experimental evidence for its conservation has been obtained in xanthomonas campestris, caulobacter crescentus and vibrio cholerae  <cit> . in vitro characterization of xer recombinases and dif sites has also been carried in haemophilus influenzae and bacillus subtilis  <cit> . however, the importance of dif/xercd for the fitness of bacteria has only been demonstrated in e. coli and v. cholerae  <cit> . in some other bacteria, like lactococci and streptococci, chromosome dimer resolution is resolved by single tyrosine recombinases that act at specific dif site  <cit> . in this case, dimer resolution still depends on ftsk and dif is still located opposite the origin of replication between oriented polar sequences  <cit> . several filamentous phages are known to hijack this site-specific recombination machinery of dif/xercd for their integration into the host chromosome, containing pseudo-dif sequences within these phage genomes  <cit> . however, the dif sequence remains intact during such recombination process to ensure the integrity of chromosome dimer resolution machinery  <cit> . the dif-like sequences in phages often contain more variable central region that is longer than the canonical  <dig> bp  <cit> , and the xerd binding arm is considerably degenerate  <cit> .

because there is only one origin of replication on bacterial circular chromosomes, replication generally terminates in a specific region of the chromosome. this can be followed by the existence of a gc skew on the two replichore arms of the chromosomes with a shift-point opposite the origin of replication  <cit> . based on the observation that dif sites are generally located at or near the gc skew shift-point, hendrickson and lawrence proposed that replication might generally terminate at dif, which coordinate replication and chromosome dimer resolution  <cit> . in e. coli, the replication process usually terminates at a narrow region that includes approximately 5% of the genome length and is located directly opposite the replication origin  <cit> . this is partly due to the existence of the tus/ter replication fork trap  <cit> . dif is located within the replication fork trap but termination occurs precisely at the tus site, not at dif  <cit>  and dif is active when displaced outside of the replication termination region if it is still within the zone where kops converge  <cit> . nevertheless, the lack of universal conservation of the tus protein may suggest that replication terminated at dif sites until the relatively recent takeover by the tus-ter system  <cit> . we reasoned therefore that the comprehensive identification of dif sites and of their location with respect to the gc skew shift-point in hundreds of complete genomes might provide clues to the evolution of the cdr machinery and its possible link with the replication termination mechanism in bacterial species.

prediction of the dif sequences has been reported by several groups with different approaches. hendrickson and lawrence showed that sequence skew can be used to predict the location of dif sites, and they identified putative dif sequences in  <dig> bacteria based on sequence similarity  <cit> . le bourgeois and colleagues reported a new type of tyrosine recombinase, named xers, which is responsible for cdr in streptococci and lactococci and this recombinase targets a 31-bp sequence element named difsl  <cit> . for comparison, they predicted dif sequences in  <dig> firmicutes based on their similarity to that of b. subtilis with megablast  <cit>  and on the fact that the dif sequence occurs only once per genome. val and colleagues identified that v. cholerae chromosome ii, whose many features are plasmid-like, has an original dif sequence independently, and therefore it has ftsk-dependent cdr  <cit> . for this purpose, they predicted dif sequences in five α-proteobacteria and ten β-proteobacteria that harbour multiple chromosomes, and discussed a conserved ftsk-dependent cdr on multiple chromosomes based on the close relative distance of the position of dif sequences and the gc skew shift-points. their prediction method is based on a hmmer  <cit>  score  with a profile built from  <dig> aligned dif sequences in the largest chromosomes of γ-proteobacteria species, with manual checking for 6-bp spacing between two xerc and xerd binding motifs.

carnoy and roten reported the most comprehensive predictions to date, identifying putative dif sequences in  <dig> chromosomes in  <dig> proteobacteria strains, discussing the high conservation of dif/xercd systems and the possible loss of dif sequences in endosymbionts, with suggestions for other cdr mechanisms  <cit> . here, the prediction was based on blast searches and yass alignment  <cit>  with the dif sequences of e. coli and b. subtilis, and candidates were selected based on their proximity to the gc skew shift-points and a single occurrence per chromosome. previous predictions were therefore limited to three bacterial phyla: proteobacteria, firmicutes and actinobacteria.

to this end, we describe comprehensive predictions for dif sequences based on a machine learning approach, tracing the phylogenetic conservation patterns of xercd recombinases and using an iterative hidden markov modeling method. furthermore, we observed the relationship between predicted dif sequence positions and gc skew shift-points, and investigated whether replication termination occurs at the dif site.

RESULTS
overview of dif sequence prediction
we first analyzed the phylogenetic conservation patterns of xerc and xerd in bacterial species by calculating the distances of their amino acid sequences from those in the seed organisms with known dif sequences . as depicted in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  sequence similarity distributions were clearly distinguished by phylum. sequences belonging to different phyla always showed clustalw distances of ≥ <dig> , and based on this phylogenetic distribution pattern, we separately trained and predicted the dif sequences in each phylum using iterated hmm. by this phylogenetic prediction approach, we predicted dif sequences in  <dig> genomes out of  <dig> that harbor the xercd recombinase . the same prediction method was applied for  <dig> organisms with multiple chromosomes, totaling  <dig> chromosomes, where we could predict dif sequences in  <dig> organisms with  <dig> chromosomes .

chr: chromosomes

all of these predictions resulted in unique hits above the threshold, and their validity was further confirmed through leave-one-out cross-validation. on the other hand, predictions below the threshold  often resulted in multiple candidates with insufficient scores. when the initial prediction using the strict threshold failed, we manually checked the predicted sequences for the conservation of palindromic structure in the 7-12-bp and 17-22-bp positions, and candidates that were located close to the origin of replication were removed because the displacement of a dif sequence near the origin significantly reduces the growth rate  <cit> .

prediction results of each phylum
in proteobacteria, fuzzy matching in  <dig> escherichia strains based on the dif sequence of e. coli k <dig> for the creation of an initial seed profile hidden markov model yielded a unique dif sequence in each of the  <dig> strains. iterated hmm using this seed profile resulted in unique predictions over the validation threshold in  <dig> genomes. an additional  <dig> chromosomes in  <dig> genomes were predicted with iterated hmm separated by classes, and  <dig> distant genomes were predicted using an alternative seed profile created with the  <dig> most similar genomes. the predicted dif sequences totaled  <dig> in  <dig> organisms, with a prediction rate of  <dig> % for single-chromosome strains and  <dig> % for multiple-chromosome strains. predictions failed in eight organisms and ten chromosomes, namely, agrobacterium tumefaciens str. c <dig>  paracoccus denitrificans pd <dig> chromosome i, ii , burkholderia phytofirmans psjn chromosome i, burkholderia sp.  <dig> chromosome i, iii, nitrosospira multiformis atcc  <dig> , desulfotalea psychrophila lsv <dig> , sulfurimonas denitrificans dsm  <dig> and nitratiruptor sp. sb155- <dig> .

for firmicutes, fuzzy matching in  <dig> bacillus strains  yielded a unique dif sequence in each of the  <dig> strains. iterated hmm using this seed profile resulted in unique prediction over the validation threshold for  <dig> chromosomes in  <dig> genomes. the dif sequences are predicted in a total of  <dig> organisms, with a prediction rate of  <dig> %. prediction failed in three genomes, namely, clostridium perfringens str.  <dig>  c. beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> , and lactobacillus helveticus dpc  <dig> .

although no experimentally confirmed dif sequence is available for actinobacteria, that of f. alni is suggested to be 5'-cacgccgataatgcacattatgtcaagt-3'  <cit> . therefore, we used this sequence for fuzzy matching in two genomes, nocardia farcinica ifm  <dig> and mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis k- <dig>  whose xercd amino acid sequences were most similar to those of f. alni. iterated hmm using this seed profile resulted in successful predictions above the validation threshold in all  <dig> genomes.

in chlorobi, an initial seed profile was created with predicted dif sequences in chlorobaculum parvum ncib  <dig> and prosthecochloris aestuarii dsm  <dig> that scored above the validation thresholds using the firmicutes profile, which resulted in the highest scores compared to those of proteobacteria and actinobacteria. likewise, the profile of firmicutes yielded the highest scores in chlamydiae, where the initial seed profile was created from predicted dif sequences in chlamydophila pneumoniae cwl <dig> and protochlamydia amoebophila uwe <dig>  which were below the validation thresholds, but contained palindromic structure and were located within  <dig> - <dig>  degrees from the shift-points of gc skew. using these seed profiles, iterated hmm successfully predicted dif sequences in all  <dig> genomes in chlorobi and  <dig> genomes in chlamydiae.

because the number of genomes is very small in all of the other phyla, we utilized the profiles of proteobacteria, firmicutes, actinobacteria, chlorobi, and chlamydia that were created thus far instead of applying iterated hmm based on specific seed profiles, and all of the following candidates were confirmed based on scores, palindromic structure, and position. in elusimicrobia and tenericutes, all profiles showed high hmmer scores, and predictions using the profiles of firmicutes and chlamydiae predicted identical dif sequences. similarly, the profiles of firmicutes, chlamydiae, and proteobacteria predicted identical dif sequences in nitrospirae, and predictions based on the profiles of proteobacteria and chlorobi were identical in gemmatimonadetes.

in spirochaetes, predictions using the profiles of firmicutes, chlamydiae and proteobacteria profiles resulted in unique dif sequences in species with single chromosomes, and the profiles of firmicutes were used for the predictions of  <dig> chromosomes in  <dig> species with multiple chromosomes, all with hmmer scores above the validation thresholds. the most suitable profiles varied among species in other phyla. in acidobacteria, the dif sequence of acidobacterium capsulatum atcc  <dig> was predicted by the profiles of firmicutes, chlamydiae, and chlorobi dif sequences, and other species were predicted using the profile of firmicutes only. in verrucomicrobia, profiles based on proteobacteria, firmicutes and chlorobi predicted methylacidiphilum infernorum v <dig>  and that of proteobacteria and firmicutes predicted opitutus terrae pb90- <dig> and akkermansia muciniphila atcc baa- <dig>  in chloroflexi, the chlorobi profile was suitable for dehalococcoides sp. bav <dig> and dehalococcoides sp. cbdb <dig>  and that of actinobacteria was used in d. ethenogenes  <dig> dif sequences. dif sequences were predicted in  <dig> bacteroidetes strains using the profile of proteobacteria, and those in five strains were predicted using alternative profiles created with the three most similar genomes. in this way, we successfully predicted dif sequences in most phyla, although the prediction failed in the phyla cyanobacteria and planctomycetes.

correlation of the dif sequence position and the gc skew shift-points
using the predicted dif sequences, we compared their positions within the genome to the shift-points of the gc skew. firstly, we analyzed the distributions of relative genomic distances of xerc, xerd and ftsk genes from the predicted dif sites. as a result, xerc genes were mostly located near the dif sites, xerd genes were near the replication origin, and ftsk genes were located mostly in between xerc and xerd genes . the comparison of positions between predicted dif sites and the shift-points of the gc skew showed that the dif sequences predicted in the phyla proteobacteria and firmicutes correlated significantly with the gc skew shift-points that are highly likely to be located within the terminus region . the differences among these positions fell to within  <dig> - <dig> % of the genome for ±1σ, and outliers did not exceed 3% in distance relative to the genome size . the above results confirm that chromosome replication and cdr are related, and that show the accuracy of the predictions described in this work.

to further investigate whether replication terminates at the dif site, by observing the overall contribution of the genomic selection/mutation pressures of the replication machinery to the collinearity of the dif sequence positions and gc skew shift-points, we plotted the distances between them against the gc skew index  of genomes to quantify the degree of replicational mutation/selection pressures. gcsi is an index that quantifies the degree of gc skew of a given genome, which can be used as a comparative measure of the accumulated replicational mutation/selection pressures  <cit> . since the strength of the gc skew is speculated to partly correlate with the growth rate of bacteria  <cit> , high replication mutation/selection rate indicated by gcsi implies a greater number of replication events in these organisms. therefore, if the replication terminates at or around the dif site, even allowing for statistical fluctuations, we can assume that the increasing number of replication events should shape gc skew shift-points closer to the dif site by the central limit theorem and by the law of large numbers. hence, genomes with higher gcsi should have closer relative distance between the gc skew shift-points and dif sites, if replication terminates at the dif site. however, as depicted in figure 2b, we observed no correlation between these two variables .

discussion
in this study, we first demonstrated that the conservation of xercd genes follows phylogenetic conservation patterns that are specific to each bacterial phylum . based on this principle, we comprehensively predicted the dif sequences in hundreds of completely sequenced genomes using a recursive strategy that iteratively models and predicts these sequences using profile hidden markov models. as a result, we obtained unique candidate dif sequences in  <dig> chromosomes in  <dig> strains that were validated through multiple means, resulting in the largest collection of predicted dif sequences assembled to date. in comparison to previous work by carnoy and roten, which predicted dif sequences in  <dig> genomes, our predictions coincided with their results in  <dig> genomes and we added  <dig> genomes, including aromatoleum aromaticum str. ebn <dig>  which carnoy and roten reported to lack the dif/xercd system. excluding strains or chromosomes we could not predict, namely, a. tumefaciens str. c <dig>  burkholderia sp.  <dig> chromosome i, ii, d. psychrophila lsv <dig>  n. multiformis atcc  <dig>  p. denitrificans pd <dig> chromosome i, ii and s. denitrificans dsm  <dig>  the predicted dif sequences in this study differed in  <dig> chromosomes in comparison to the results of carnoy and roten: c. crescentus cb <dig>  granulibacter bethesdensis cgdnih <dig>  pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis tac <dig> chromosome ii, ralstonia eutropha h <dig> chromosome ii, rhodobacter sphaeroides  <dig> . <dig> chromosome i, r. sphaeroides  <dig> . <dig> chromosome ii, rickettsia bellii osu 85- <dig>  r. conorii, r. felis urrwxcal <dig>  r. prowazekii, r. typhi wilmington, and shewanella sp. ana- <dig>  for r. eutropha h <dig> chromosome ii and p. haloplanktis tac <dig> chromosome ii, both studies predicted positions that were symmetric from the origin of replication, and although experimental confirmation is required to confirm which candidates function in vivo, the palindromic structures of the xercd binding sites are more conserved in the candidates predicted by our method. therefore, overall, our results were identical with those of carnoy and roten for 92% of the genome analyzed , and 11/ <dig> mismatch resulted in candidates with more conserved xercd binding sites, with the addition of  <dig> genomes among numerous phyla. carnoy and roten noted that some vibrio species contain two dif sites both located at the vicinity of the gc skew shift-points. therefore, we further tested whether the predicted dif sites in multiple chromosomes are all located near the gc skew shift-points. using 5% genomic distance as a threshold,  <dig> out of  <dig> strains with two chromosomes, including vibrio species, and  <dig> out of  <dig> strains with three chromosomes showed such agreement of the positions, .

there are four factors that may explain the advantages of our results. first, the selection of bacterial strains in the study by carnoy and roten was limited to genomes harboring xercd that were identified by their similarity to those of e. coli, whereas we used all genomes with xercd orthologs as identified by the kegg orthology database. while there is a little time-delay until the sequences are annotated and incorporated into the kegg orthology database, use of this database provides a more generic and comprehensive starting point. second, similarity searches using software tools such as blast are not suitable for short sequence motifs that undergo mutation, and the difficulty in identifying only those dif sequences with sequence similarity has been shown for c. crescentus  <cit>  and several classes of proteobacteria  <cit> . third, dif sequences require two binding motifs of xerc and xerd to be functional  <cit> ; therefore, the conservation of palindromic structure at the 7-12-bp and 17-22-bp positions should be confirmed for each predicted candidate. finally, the use of iterated hmm allowed dif sequence prediction using the profiles of closely related species for each iteration, following the phylogenetic conservation pattern of xercd.

the high predictability shown in this study suggests that the dif/xercd system of chromosome dimer resolution is highly conserved among bacterial species and that dif sequences are almost always conserved when xercd is present within the genome. in fact, according to the kegg orthology database, xerc and xerd are conserved in approximately 60-70% of bacterial species, which is a higher percentage than is found for the replication termination protein tus  <cit>  and for universal genes such as the sos response repressor lexa  <cit> . in light of the remarkable conservation of the dif/xercd system, although it is beyond the scope of this study, explorations of alternative cdr machinery in species that lack the dif/xercd machinery would be an interesting area of future research. chromosome dimer resolution pathways are suggested to be present in species that lack the dif/xercd system, and several alternative pathways have been reported and suggested. le bourgeois et al. reported an unconventional cdr pathway involving only one recombinase  in streptococci and lactococci, along with a 31-bp dif sequence  <cit> . similarly, through computational analysis, carnoy and roten suggested the existence of another pathway, termed xerh, in ε-proteobacteria in place of xercd and xers and discussed the likelihood of the existence of dif analogues in these species  <cit> . the basic strategy of iterated hmm should be applicable in predicting dif analogues in these species when defined seed sequences and detailed positions of recombinase binding sites are elucidated.

although we limited our analysis to strains containing xercd orthologs, our predictions failed in several species. in proteobacteria, we could not identify dif sequences in five organisms and seven chromosomes, including species with single chromosomes  that are ε-proteobacteria, where an alternative cdr mechanism involving xerh is suggested  <cit> , and species with multiple chromosomes . among these, b. phytofirmans psjn and burkholderia sp.  <dig> contained dif sequences in other chromosomes, indicating that the dif/xercd system is conserved in these strains. similarly, in firmicutes, we could not determine dif sequence in l. helveticus dpc  <dig>  c. perfringens str.  <dig> or c. beijerinckii ncimb  <dig>  among these strains, l. helveticus dpc  <dig> has an alternative cdr recombinase xers in its genome, indicating that the dif/xercd system may not be functional. this is an intriguing example of possible evolutionary intermediate with the co-existence of two systems, presumably resulting from a horizontal gene transfer event. while we are unable to find a dif sequence corresponding to the xers machinery, xers gene in this species is located close to the gc skew shift-point , which is indicative of its functionality as shown in previous works  <cit> . c. perfringens str.  <dig> and c. beijerinckii exhibit highly biased gc contents , and hidden markov profiling of at-rich dif sequences may have failed due to the background at-richness of the genome. comparative studies of dif/xercd systems using close relatives of these genomes may provide evolutionary clues regarding the acquisition and loss of cdr machinery. for example, mapping the types of cdr machinery to the phylogenetic tree of ε-proteobacteria obtained using 16s rrna sequences with the dnaml program in the phylip package shows that a xerh type of cdr machinery may have diverged at an early stage within this phylum. the xercd type of cdr seems to be absent in the campylobacter and helicobacter genera, except for helicobacter hepaticus, which suggests the existence of the xerh type of cdr in the common ancestor of these species . the dif candidate in h. hepaticus was predicted with iterated hmm only marginally above the threshold, with a score of  <dig>  and an e-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  further analysis is required to identify whether this species actually contains dif/xercd or xerh-type machinery.

predictions failed in all species belonging to the phylum cyanobacteria. although xercd is present in these species, the sequence similarity distance of xercd in cyanobacteria to those of other phyla was high , with a minimum distance of  <dig>  to actinosynnema mirum , which exceeded the  <dig>  threshold that was shown in figure  <dig>  therefore, this divergence of xercd in cyanobacteria from those of other phyla implies low applicability of the iterated hmm approach, which utilizes the phylogenetic conservation pattern of xercd. one possible explanation for the prediction failure in this phylum is that the dif sequences and xercd are highly divergent in cyanobacteria, preventing their identification with sequence profiles. the replication origin in cyanobacteria is yet to be identified, and gc skew is weak in these species, implying low degree of replicational mutation/selection pressures, which could also be a reason for the failure of prediction in these species.

predicted dif sequences largely existed in non-coding regions . more than half of these coding regions that contained dif sequences were hypothetical, with no functional annotation. furthermore, we found two dif sequences included in phage orf in vibrio and xanthomonas. while these sequences may be integrated with the phages by their hijacking of the host recombination machinery, these sequences are speculated to be the functional dif sites, due to  <dig>  their unique occurrence within the genome opposite of the replication origin, and  <dig>  their similarity as identified by our phylogenetic modeling approach. as previously shown in proteobacteria  <cit> , the xerc binding site is more variable and the xerd binding site is more conserved in all phyla , both for genomes with single chromosomes and for those with multiple chromosomes, presumably due to the interaction between xerd and ftsk for the initiation of first strand exchange  <cit> . the dif sequences in α-proteobacteria with single chromosomes showed higher variation compared to these of other classes and phyla, but this variation was correlated with variations in genomic gc content . these differences between variations are partly explains the failure of our prediction in extremely at-rich genomes, such as those found in c. perfringens and c. beijerinckii.

although dif sequences are expected to be located near the shift-point of the gc skew, we did not use this feature to predict and validate dif sequences with iterated hmm; therefore, using the comprehensively predicted dif sequences across numerous phyla, we were able to directly compare the positions of predicted dif sequences with those of the gc skew shift-points to analyze their relationships. as expected, these two positions are highly correlated in terms of genomic loci, confirming a previous work  <cit> . in this respect, because gc skew is the cumulative result of replicational selection/mutations, the degree of conservation of the cdr machinery is presumably in concordance with the degree of replication selection/mutation pressures , which is partly characterized by the difference in the replication machinery and partly characterized by the growth rate  <cit> . on the other hand, as shown in figure 2b, the differences in the positions of the gc skew shift-point and the strength of the gc skew, as quantified by gcsi, were not correlated. if replication termination occurs at the dif site, as proposed by hendrickson and lawrence  <cit> , a stronger gc skew that is generated by a larger number of replication events and/or a higher mutation rate should statistically bring the gc skew shift-point closer to the dif site by the central limit theorem and law of large numbers. in fact, the overall correlation of these loci leads to the proposal that the dif site is the replication termination point. however, because a stronger degree of replication mutation/selection pressures does not bring these two loci closer to each other, they are not in a causal relationship. therefore, although the dif sequence is located near the replication termination site for efficient cdr, the replication termination site is suggested to be at a site other than the dif site, as was recently shown in vivo  <cit> . on the other hand, the dif sequences in firmicutes are more conserved in various phyla because the profile of firmicutes was the best suited as the initial profile of iterated hmm in chlorobi, acidobacteria, gemmatimonadetes, nitrospirae, elusimicrobia, tenericutes, and spirochaetes, where initial seed sequences were not available, and those in proteobacteria were more variable, as shown by the requirement to predict by iterated hmm in classes instead of phyla. tus proteins, which are shown to terminate replication in vivo, are more conserved in proteobacteria and are not widely conserved in other, partly supporting the possible change in replication termination mechanism by a relatively recent takeover by the tus-ter system  <cit> . on the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, tus analogues have not been comprehensively searched in other phyla, and therefore further analysis is required in order to fully support this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
by taking the phylogenetic iterated hmm approach and validating predicted candidates through a combination of hmmer score thresholds, conservation of palindromic structure, and cross-validation, we achieved a comprehensive identification of unique dif candidates in hundreds of genomes. as the result, we obtained unique candidate dif sequences in  <dig> chromosomes in  <dig> strains that were validated through multiple means, resulting in the largest collection of predicted dif sequences assembled to date. all of the predicted dif sequences described in this study, as well as visualizations of dif locations on circular genome maps, are freely available in an online database at http://www.g-language.org/data/repter/. the locations of dif sequences can be useful for studies of the regions surrounding the replication terminus, for phylogenetic studies of the replication termination and chromosome dimer resolution mechanisms, and can serve as supporting evidence for gc skew analyses.

furthermore, we compared the positions of predicted dif sequences with those of the gc skew shift-points to understand the relationship between dif sequence and replication terminus using gcsi. as the result, although these two positions were highly correlated in terms of genomic loci, the differences in the positions of the gc skew shift-point and the gcsi were not correlated. therefore, despite the dif sequence is located near the replication termination site for efficient cdr, the replication termination site is suggested to be at a site other than the dif site.
