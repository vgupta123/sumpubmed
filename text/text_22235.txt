BACKGROUND
hand, foot and mouth disease  is a mild exanthematous and febrile disease, which often poses a persistent global public health problem. in recent years, outbreaks of hfmd have been reported from many parts of the world such as malaysia  <cit> , taiwan  <cit> , singapore  <cit> , mainland china  <cit> , brunei  <cit> , western australia  <cit> , the unites states  <cit>  and germany  <cit> . the two major etiological agents for hfmd are enterovirus  <dig>  and coxsackievirus a <dig> , which belong to the enterovirus genus of the picornaviridae family  <cit>  and usually co-circulate during hfmd outbreaks  <cit> . in addition to hfmd, ev <dig> is also associated with herpangina, myocarditis, encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and pulmonary oedema or haemorrhage. ev <dig> usually infects children, while sometimes it can infect adults by intra-familial transmission  <cit> . generally, children and adults infected present different symptoms. data from a recent study indicated that 21% of ev71-infected children experienced severe complications including central nervous system  complications and cardiopulmonary failure. by contrast, 53% of infected adults were asymptomatic, and all symptomatic adults recovered completely from uncomplicated illness  <cit> . however, there were several reports about adults infected with severe complications. it was reported that in november  <dig>  a 37-year-old woman suffered from acute encephalitis due to intra-familial transmission of ev <dig>  <cit> . in  <dig> a 19-year-old man even died from ev <dig> encephalitis in singapore  <cit> . ca <dig> appeared to have been attracting very little interest probably due to its association with often mild and benign clinical symptoms. therefore, there had been much less data about ca <dig> than ev <dig> 

both ev <dig> and ca <dig> were divided into several subtypes by vp1s  or vp4s . data from molecular epidemiological studies indicated that ev <dig> consisted of  <dig> genotypes a, b  and c   <cit> . however, c <dig> was being proposed as genotype d recently  <cit> . based on phylogenetic analysis of vp4s, ca <dig> was classified into three distinct genetic lineages a, b, and c. lineage a was represented by only one isolate of the prototype g <dig>  <cit> . in a recent report, ca <dig> was divided into two distinct genogroups a and b based on vp1s, which was probably a more accurate description for vp1s containing more nucleotides and genetic information. the prototype g <dig> was the only member of genogroup a. genogroup b was divided into two separate lineages   <cit> . in fact, lineage b and c viruses in the analysis based on vp4s represented lineage b <dig> and lineage b <dig> viruses, respectively, in genogroup b as determined using complete vp <dig> sequences  <cit> . the capsids of both ev <dig> and ca <dig> consisted of  <dig> proteins: vp <dig> , vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> . vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> were on the outer part of the caspid while vp <dig> is on the inner part of it. it was believed that neutralization epitopes resided mainly on vp <dig>  so most of researches had been focused on vp <dig>  but only few on vp <dig> 

outbreaks of hfmd have occurred each year in beijing recently  <cit>  with various severity and outcomes of the disease which is associated with the predominant virus. the vp1s and vp4s of ev <dig> and ca <dig> isolated from the specimens collected from patients of hfmd in beijing from  <dig> to  <dig> were sequenced and analyzed together with some corresponding sequences obtained from genbank using dnastar and mega  <dig>  to analyze if the clinical manifestations of the children infected were related to the variation of the genes of the viruses. vp <dig> and vp <dig> encoding genes from field strains of ev <dig> and ca <dig> were cloned and expressed in e. coli bl <dig> cells. these expressed vp1s and vp4s were used as antigens to detect igm and igg antibodies in serum samples from children by western blot to analyze and compare their antigenicity and the prevalence of these two viruses.

RESULTS
the epidemiologic characteristics of hfmd in children visiting our hospital from  <dig> to 2009
from  <dig> to  <dig>  no large epidemics of hfmd like some other provinces in china were reported in beijing, but small local outbreaks with only a few cases with severe complications did occur. during these years,  <dig> clinical specimens were collected from  <dig> patients who visited the affiliated children's hospital to our institute, including  <dig> throat swabs and  <dig> vesicle fluids, and the case number each year was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . these specimens were subject to rt-pcr for ev <dig> and ca <dig> detection by using specific primers, followed by virus isolation with vero cells. out of these  <dig> clinical specimens,  <dig>  virus strains were isolated. co-infection by ev <dig> and ca <dig> was not found in these samples. of the patients with molecularly confirmed ev <dig> or ca <dig> infection, the age ranged from  <dig> month to  <dig> years old, with 95% of the patients being less than  <dig> years old. the positive rates for ev <dig> in the cases from whom specimens were collected were  <dig> %  in the year of  <dig>   <dig> %  in  <dig> and  <dig> %  in  <dig>  the positive rate for ca <dig> was  <dig> %  in the year of  <dig>   <dig> %  in  <dig> and  <dig> %  in  <dig>  therefore, the predominant etiological agent of hfmd in beijing was ca <dig> in  <dig> and  <dig> but ev <dig> in  <dig> 

comparison of vp1s and vp4s among ev <dig> and ca16
the vp1s from  <dig> strains of ev <dig> isolated from clinical specimens in this study were sequenced and compared with vp1s from  <dig> strains of ev <dig> obtained from genbank . pairwise nucleotide and amino acid comparison of these sequences showed that the variability among them was small. the nucleotide identities among these sequences were  <dig> %~ <dig> % and the deduced amino acid identities among them were  <dig> %~ <dig> %, indicating that changes in amino acids were fewer than those in nucleotides. the vp4s from  <dig> out of these  <dig> field strains of ev <dig> were also sequenced and analyzed with vp4s from other  <dig> strains of ev <dig> obtained from genbank . the nucleotide identities in these vp4s were similar to those in vp1s but the deduced amino acid sequences for these vp4s were  <dig> %~ <dig> %. in addition, nucleotide sequence comparisons between sequences of ev <dig> isolated from mild cases and those of ev <dig> isolated from severe cases in the present study showed that there were no consistent divergences of nucleotides in vp1s or vp4s . the vp1s from  <dig> strains of ca <dig> isolated from clinical specimens in this study were sequenced and analyzed with vp1s from  <dig> strains of ca <dig> obtained from genbank . the nucleotide identities among them were  <dig> % ~ <dig> % while the deduced amino acid identities of them were  <dig> %~ <dig> %. the nucleotide identities among those ca <dig> vp4s were  <dig> %~ <dig> % and the deduced amino acids of them were identical .

the nucleotide sequences of vp1s between ev <dig> and ca <dig> were also compared using megalign of dnastar. both vp <dig> encoding gene from ev <dig> and ca <dig> was  <dig> nucleotides in length and the deduced amino acids of them were  <dig> in length. the identities of nucleotides for them were  <dig> %~ <dig> % and the deduced amino acid identities for them were  <dig> %~ <dig> %. the comparison between vp4s from ev <dig> and ca <dig> using megalign of dnastar showed that the number of nucleotides was  <dig> in length and the deduced amino acids of them were  <dig> in length. the identities of nucleotides among them were  <dig> %~ <dig> % and the identities of the deduced amino acids were  <dig> %~ <dig> % .

phylogenetic analysis of complete vp1s and vp4s from ev <dig> and ca16
phylogenetic analysis of ev <dig> was based on the alignment of complete vp <dig> and vp <dig> gene sequences from ev <dig>  a total of  <dig> strains were included in the phylogenetic analysis of the ev <dig> vp <dig> genes. among them, vp1s from  <dig> ev <dig> field strains were sequenced in this study,  <dig> strains available in genbank were reported in other studies in china,  <dig> strains obtained from genbank were used as genotype reference and ca <dig> strain g- <dig> was used as an outgroup. phylogenetic analysis of complete ev <dig> vp1s showed that these  <dig> ev <dig> strains isolated in this study from  <dig> to  <dig> was closest to c <dig> sub-genotype . the phylogenetic analysis tree of ev <dig> vp4s  including  <dig> strains isolated in this study,  <dig> strains reported in other studies in china and deposited in genbank,  <dig> strains obtained from genbank and used as genotype references and ca <dig> strain g- <dig> used as an outgroup, showed consistent result with that of phylogenetic analysis of complete vp1s. in the same way, vp1s from  <dig> ca <dig> strains isolated in this study,  <dig> sequences obtained from genbank and ev <dig> strain brcr used as an outgroup for phylogenetic tree analysis showed that lineage b <dig> of ca <dig> circulated in beijing during  <dig> to  <dig> . the phylogenetic analysis of complete ca <dig> vp4s including  <dig> sequences isolated in this study,  <dig> sequences obtained from genbank and ev <dig> strain brcr used as an outgroup showed that the ca <dig> viruses isolated in beijing belonged to lineage c , which was consistent with results from vp1s.

detection of igm and igg against ev <dig> and ca <dig> in serum samples by western blot using expressed vp <dig> and vp <dig> as antigens
the vp4s of ev <dig>  and ca <dig>  as well as vp1s of ev <dig>  and ca <dig>  were expressed in e. coli bl <dig> and used as antigen by western blot to detect specific igm antibodies in serum samples collected from children with acute enterovirus  infections . out of  <dig> serum samples from children with acute ev <dig> infection,  <dig> were positive for vp <dig> of s <dig>  and  <dig> for vp <dig> of s <dig> . out of  <dig> serum samples from children with acute ca <dig> infections, the number of positive serum samples for s <dig> vp <dig> and s <dig> vp <dig> were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. this result suggested that vp1s from ev <dig> and ca <dig> could be used for the detection of igm specific antibodies in serum samples from patients with acute infections . when expressed vp4s of s <dig>  and s <dig>  were used as antigen to detect specific igm, all of these  <dig> serum samples were negative, which raised the question about the antigenicity of the expressed vp4s from ev <dig> and ca <dig> 

the data indicate the igm detection in  <dig> sera from patients with acute ev <dig> infections by western blot using s <dig> vp <dig> and s <dig> vp <dig>  the igm detection in  <dig> sera from patients with acute ca <dig> infections by western blot using s <dig> vp <dig> and s <dig> vp <dig> is shown in italics.

these  <dig> expressed proteins were then used to detect specific igg antibodies by western blot  in  <dig> serum samples, including  <dig> sera collected from adults for regular health check up and  <dig> sera from children without acute ev infections. the serum positive rate for igg against ev <dig> vp <dig>  ca <dig> vp <dig>  ev <dig> vp <dig> and ca <dig> vp <dig> were  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively. the data indicated that the expressed vp4s of ev <dig> and ca <dig> were of good antigenicity in the test of igg specific antibodies. there was significant difference between the positive rates of igg antibodies against vp1s of ev <dig> and ca <dig> , implying that these two proteins were not cross-reactive which was similar to the results from the study conducted by shih et al  <cit> . the positive rates of igg antibodies against vp4s of ev <dig> and ca <dig>  also suggested that there was no cross-reactivity between them. the sera-positive rate of ev <dig> vp <dig> was higher than that of ev <dig> vp <dig>  and in the same way the sera-positive rate of ca <dig> vp <dig> was higher than that of ca <dig> vp <dig>  , which might be associated with the position of the proteins in the capsid of the virus, that was vp <dig> was located on the outside of the capsid while vp <dig> was located on the inside of the capsid. the serum igg positive rates against vp <dig> and vp <dig> of ev <dig> were lower than those of ca <dig>  suggesting that the exposure rate to ev <dig> was lower than that to ca <dig> in the population.

discussion
ev <dig> and ca <dig> were two of the members of the picornaviridae family, whose genomes were characterized by a single positive-stranded genomic rna. due to their poor fidelity replication and frequent recombination, the genomes of ev <dig> and ca <dig> mutated at a high rate. different genotypes and sub-genotypes of these  <dig> viruses had alternated and co-circulated in the asia-pacific region, leading to repeated outbreaks of hfmd. the first reported large, severe and devastating hfmd epidemic occurred in taiwan region in  <dig> including about  <dig> cases of hfmd, among whom  <dig> patients were severe and  <dig> died  <cit> . in  <dig>  there was another report of outbreak, with  <dig> cases of hfmd and  <dig> deaths there  <cit> . from february to august in  <dig>  brunei with a population of about  <dig> experienced its first reported major outbreak of ev <dig>  more than  <dig> children were affected, with  <dig> deaths resulting from severe neurologic complications  <cit> . in mainland china, hfmd broke out repeatedly in recent years. there were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cases in the nationwide in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, reported by the ministry of health, the people's republic of china. the corresponding deaths for these years were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. it suggested that hfmd had been becoming a more and more serious public health problem in china.

in beijing, no large hfmd epidemic has occurred so far, but sporadic infections are common. in  <dig> and  <dig>  the predominant etiological agents of hfmd in beijing were ca <dig> while the main etiological agent was ev <dig> in  <dig>  in general, comparison for nucleotides among vp1s or vp4s of ev <dig> indicated that the nucleotide identity of these sequences from strains isolated in the same year was higher than that of those sequences from strains isolated in the different years, and the nucleotide identity of these sequences isolated in this study was higher than that of those sequences reported in other parts of mainland china and especially other countries of the world. however, it was not necessarily true. for example, the nucleotide identity of s <dig> vp <dig> isolated in  <dig> and those isolated in  <dig> in this research was higher than that of s <dig> vp <dig> and s <dig> vp <dig> isolated in the same year of  <dig>  this suggested that the transmission of ev <dig> was not strictly regional and temporal restriction. in addition, the nucleotide comparison also indicated that the severity of patients' illness caused by ev <dig> infection seemed not to be correlated with the sequence mutations in vp <dig> or vp <dig>  the phylogenetic data in this study indicated that c <dig> of ev <dig> and lineage b <dig>  of ca <dig> had been circulating in beijing in these  <dig> years and major mutations were not observed in these virus strains, which was similar to the results reported by other parts of mainland china  <cit> . in mainland china there were no subgenotypes other than c <dig> of ev <dig> reported which seemed to be regionally and temporally restricted, but it was not true for the lineage of ca <dig>  in shenzhen, lineage b <dig> and b <dig> co-circulated in  <dig> and  <dig>  but only lineage b <dig> was found from  <dig> to  <dig>  in other parts of the world, the transmission of genotypes of ev <dig> and lineages of ca <dig> showed a different trend. for example, in malaysia ev <dig> outbreaks occurred in  <dig> and  <dig>  mainly associated with genotypes b <dig> and b <dig> alternating in the  <dig> years <cit> , and lineage b <dig> and b <dig> of ca <dig> coexisted in  <dig> and  <dig> <cit> . in taiwan region, ev <dig> epidemics were associated with genotype c <dig> and b <dig> 

the overall sero-positive rates of vp <dig> of ev <dig> and ca <dig> in this research were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, which were higher than those reported by rabenau et al, whose data showed  <dig> % for ev <dig> and  <dig> % for ca <dig> for those individuals ≥  <dig> years old  <cit> . the difference of sero-positive rate in these two studies might be caused by the variety of the detection method used or age group of the participants. nevertheless, both results from our study and rabenau' suggested that the exposure rate of ca <dig> was higher than that of ev <dig> in the population.

ev <dig> other than ca <dig> was the cause of severe cases of hfmd in young children. generally the severity of the patients infected by viruses was associated with  <dig> factors: host and virulence of the virus  <cit> . when hfmd outbreaks were caused by ev <dig>  there would be some severe cases and even deaths  <cit> . ca <dig> was often associated with mild and benign clinical symptoms. then the pathogenicity of ev <dig> should be stronger than that of ca <dig>  ev <dig> and ca <dig> shared a lot in some characteristics. for example, both of them belonged to enterovirus a and had a genome of about  <dig>  k bp in length. the caspids of them consisted of  <dig> proteins: vp <dig>  vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig>  both of them could cause hfmd. however, there were also many differences between them. in this study, we designed experiments to compare ev <dig> and ca <dig> in some aspects and tried to find some of the differences. the nucleotide identities of vp <dig> between them were less than  <dig> % and the identities of deduced amino acids were no more than  <dig> %. although vp4s from them were much conserved, there were still some differences in nucleotides and the deduced amino acids. the nucleotide identities of vp4s between them were  <dig> %~ <dig> % and the deduced amino acids identities were  <dig> %~ <dig> %. there were also some differences in inducing igg in host's sera against vp <dig> and vp <dig> between ev <dig> and ca <dig>  the sera-positive rate of ev <dig> vp <dig> in the population was lower than that of ca <dig> vp <dig> and similarly the sera-positive of ev <dig> vp <dig> was lower than that of ca <dig> vp <dig>  for which there might be  <dig> reasons. one was that the exposure rate of ev <dig> might be lower than that of ca <dig>  another was that it was more difficult to induce igg against ev <dig> than ca <dig> in hosts' sera, which might be associated with the different symptoms caused by ev <dig> and ca <dig>  when the specific igm against vp4s of these two viruses were tested in serum specimens collected from children currently infected with these two viruses, none of these sera showed positive reaction.

CONCLUSIONS
ev <dig> and ca <dig> were highly diverse in the nucleotide sequences of vp1s and vp4s. the severity of illness of ev <dig> infected was not associated with the sequence variation of vp1s or vp4s. the sera positive rates of vp <dig> and vp <dig> of ev <dig> were lower than that of ca <dig>  suggesting less exposure rate to ev <dig> than ca <dig> in beijing population. the detection of serum antibodies by western blot using vp1s and vp4s as antigens indicated that the immunological reaction to vp <dig> and vp <dig> of both ev <dig> and ca <dig> was different. igm against vp <dig> but not vp <dig> was generated in children after acute infections, which needs to be clarified further.
