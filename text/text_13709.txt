BACKGROUND
we have been interested in multi-variate cytometry of the mammalian somatic cell cycle. the cell cycle can be analytically divided into a variable number of states based on the correlated levels of biochemical activities provided that the level of each activity changes in a repeating pattern and that the correlated activity patterns are not identical. for the simplest case of any single variable there are essentially  <dig> states to consider per oscillation: initial basal level , increase or decrease from basal , maximum or minimum  , and decrease or increase  to final basal level , which is not biologically equivalent to initial basal. for example, the expression of cyclins e <dig>  a <dig>  and b <dig> oscillate once per cycle, out of phase with each other. all are at "initial basal" in early g1; begin expression at different times and rise at different rates; reach max at g1/s  or g2/m ; decrease in s , prometaphase , or anaphase ; are resident at "final basal" approximately in g <dig> , metaphase , or telophase   <cit> . these expression patterns are readily discerned by immunofluorescence coupled with dna content in flow cytometry assays  <cit> . thus, measurement of the cyclins, dna, and a mitotic marker constitute highly informative analyses of cell cycle transition states characteristic of a specific population of somatic cells .

because mitosis is characterized by abrupt, specific, sequentially timed proteolysis of substrates of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome   <cit>  and an abrupt increase in kinase activities and phosphorylation of many substrates, a multi-variate cell-based approach to cell cycle analysis subdivides g <dig> and m in a straightforward manner . g <dig> is also characterized by oscillating activities, but has not been analyzed cytometrically in the same manner as m. here, we wished to extend to g <dig> this type of multi-variate analysis. one fundamental g <dig> sub-division is the kinetically defined uncommitted and committed states. the transition between these states has been labeled "r"  by yen and pardee  <cit> . the exact biochemical concept or nature of r is unknown, although most investigators would agree with a complex model that integrates signaling  at a modular level, with an "r" module containing at least the activities of d cyclin/cdk complexes and the rb/e2f family of transcription factors  <cit> . for a mathematical model that formally integrates a large body of information, see novak and tyson  <cit> . for a dissenting view see  <cit> .

without an exact biochemical definition of "r", it may be possible to quantify cells that are in a pre-r or post-r state  based on measurements of specific rb family phosphorylations; the levels of e2f transcription factors that are bound to promoters and not bound by rb family proteins, and the levels of d and e cyclins. previous work by juan et al. has shown the feasibility of this approach with an antibody that binds "hypo-phosphorylated" rb  <cit> . at this time, a comprehensive analysis would be difficult to achieve since there are  <dig> rb family proteins, three d cyclins using  <dig> cyclin dependent kinases , two e cyclins using cdk <dig>  and  <dig> e2f and  <dig> dp protein subunits that constitute e2f transcription factors as well as at least  <dig> protein inhibitors of g <dig> cdks. since much of this operates as a function of specific phosphorylations, this might be rendered simpler with probes to specific phosphorylated sites on a subset of these molecules. however, these probes are not generally available and may or may not function well in cytometric assays .

in place of the more intricate and sophisticated approach outlined above, we have asked whether the bimodal distributions shown by bivariate analyses of chromatin-bound minichromosome maintenance  proteins and dna content marks pre- and post-r g <dig> cells. these patterns were first shown by friedrich and co-workers  <cit>  and are based on measuring the residue of mcm proteins that are left behind after detergent extraction. in support of this idea, mukherjee at al. have correlated the committed period of g <dig> with high levels of bound mcm protein, hyper-phosphorylated rb, and cyclin e expression  <cit> . the approach employed by freidrich et al.  was first described by kurki et al.  <cit>  for detecting s phase specific 'tightly' bound pcna that was a subset of total pcna detected by denaturing fixation. the logic is that extraction of live cells with detergent depletes cells of 'loosely' bound proteins and other molecules that can diffuse out, leaving large structures and tightly bound proteins, including those bound to chromatin. this is also close to the standard methods of creating chromatin pellets in the primary research on replication complexes.

normal mammalian cell replication involves mechanisms to bias faithful duplication of the genome once per mitotic cell cycle. the sub-system responsible for preventing re-replication consists of a protein complex that is built on origins-of-replication  and "licensed" for initiation of dna synthesis. a licensed pre-replication complex  is built on existing complexes of orc proteins by sequential binding of cdc <dig> then cdt1/rfl-b, which then "loads" mcm proteins. licensing is complete after the  <dig> mcm proteins are loaded onto chromatin as a functional but inactive hexameric complex. cdt <dig> is rate limiting for this process. in replicating cells, licensing occurs as a continuous process from late mitosis, after loss of mitotic cdk activity, through g <dig>  <cit> .

in higher eukaryotes somatic cells, the rates of licensing are not known, however, one model for actively dividing cells  suggests that licensing begins in mitosis but origin site specification occurs in g <dig>  <cit> . models for cell cycle re-entry suggest that quiescent cells lack bound cdc <dig> and mcm proteins and therefore license in late g <dig> . on cell cycle re-entry, mcm loading appears to be dependent on cyclin e and cdc <dig> expression and activities  <cit> , which peak late in g <dig>  the rate-limiting step for initiation may be unwinding of dna by the helicase activity of the complex composed of mcm <dig> through  <dig>  <cit> . once dna synthesis has been initiated, irrevocable rescinding of the license occurs by several mechanisms, including removal of mcm proteins from the chromatin, that prevent reassembly of pre-rc in s phase. reloading does not occur until the licensing process resumes in mitosis in cycling cells or in g <dig> in stimulated quiescent cells. this system has been reviewed in detail .

the reported cytometric pattern of mcm <dig> and dna content for cv- <dig> cells provides a visualization of mcm binding in g <dig> and mcm removal from chromatin during s phase  <cit> . the expression of detergent resistant mcm <dig> was bimodal in g <dig> with low and high expressing cell clusters. the high expression cluster level was coincident with the g1/s border, suggesting that cells enter s phase only after the bound mcm complexes have reached a maximum level . in the published patterns, the levels in s decreased to a minimum at the s/g <dig> border consistent with the known cell cycle related expression  <cit> .

since origins of replication are not well mapped in higher eukaryotes, the timing of licensing and the rate of mcm loading in actively dividing cells has not been comprehensively studied. the work of friedrich et al. suggests that g <dig> cells cluster into two distinct groups with the highest cluster ~ <dig> fold greater than the lower cluster. since the frequency of cells existing in each cluster is proportional to the time spent at that state, cv- <dig> cells may pass through two g <dig> loading periods with a rapid transition between the two states. however, this type of pattern would also be consistent with exponential loading. while over-interpretation is not useful, the quantitative bimodality of g <dig> cells, if substantiated, creates a biochemically related division of g <dig> that could be the beginning of subdividing g <dig> into meaningful biochemical states that would increase the power of multi-variate analyses of the cell cycle.

since the simplest interpretation of the cv- <dig> g <dig> patterns are an early and late subdivision, our goals were to 1) determine whether the same pattern exists in human somatic cells, and 2) determine whether the low and high clusters correlate with pre- and post-restriction point states. the second goal is an experimentally more complicated approach to verifying the early â†’ late sequence, but if true, has the value of giving the measurement of tightly bound mcm proteins in g <dig> two meanings. the first is as a measure of the functional state of the mcm loading sub-system within the cellular/environmental context, and the second is as a surrogate marker for commitment to cell cycle progression.

because a bivariate analysis of any immunoreactivity versus dna content leaves an uncertainty at the g1/s interface proportional to the coefficient of variation  of the two measures, we enhanced the probability that cells would be identified as either g <dig> or s by co-staining for tightly bound pcna. s phase is associated with the release of the mcm proteins and pcna binding to replication forks . tightly bound pcna has also been shown by cytometry to correlate with incorporation of brdu  <cit> .

RESULTS
pcna and mcm <dig> are tightly bound proteins
discrimination between the pre-rc components, bound pcna and their respective soluble pools can be achieved by differential extraction with triton x- <dig>  <cit> . this has been demonstrated with mcm <dig>  mcm <dig>  <cit>  and pcna  <cit> . to confirm this, extend the observation, and to check the antibodies for non-specificity or cross-reactions, we examined mcm <dig>  mcm <dig>  pcna, orc <dig>  and cdc <dig> in whole cell lysates and those extracted with triton x- <dig> before lysis. western blots showed a  <dig> - 60% decrease in intensity in the detergent extracted lysates . a similar pattern was seen with cytometry . cyclins a <dig> and b <dig> are examples of proteins that appear completely extractable, whereas orc <dig>  orc <dig>  cdc <dig>  mcm <dig>  and mcm <dig> all retain a measurable tightly bound component. of the pre-rc proteins that we examined by cytometry , only mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> showed a bimodal distribution in g <dig> phase .

a optical densities of bands from western blots of lysates from cells that were extracted with triton x- <dig> prior to lysis were divided by the optical densities of bands from lysates. means and standard deviations for multiple experiments  are listed.

b mean fluorescence intensities of molt <dig> cells extracted with  <dig> % triton x- <dig> then fixed with methanol prior to staining were divided by the mean fluorescence intensities of molt <dig> cells fixed in methanol then stained.

at least  <dig> bound-mcm states exist in g1
the data of friedrich et al.  <cit>  suggested that there were two distinct clusters in g <dig> with low and high immunoreactivity for tightly bound mcm proteins. figure  <dig> supports this idea. figure 1a-c shows bivariate plots of dna content versus pcna  for molt <dig> cells with clearly delineated g <dig>  s, and g <dig> clusters as expected from the work of kurki et al.  <cit> . figure 1b shows the expected pattern for mcm proteins. there is a distinct low fluorescence cluster in g <dig>  that is above the isotype control  <cit>  and therefore positive for bound mcm <dig>  there is also a high positive cluster at the apex of the mcm <dig> distribution and at the g1/s interface as defined by dna content . figure 1c shows a bivariate plot for mcm <dig> versus pcna for the same cells using only the g <dig> and s phases . this analysis clearly separates late g <dig> from early s phase. the cell population shown in figure 1a-c was growing slowly at the time of fixation. figure 1d shows a plot for molt <dig> cells from a different experiment in which the cells were growing rapidly. the high mcm <dig> cluster  is heavily populated in this case whereas the "early" g <dig> cluster is not. the simplest inference from these data is that the low mcm <dig> expression g <dig> cluster represents an earlier time in g <dig> and the high mcm <dig> expression g <dig> cluster represents a late time in g <dig> 

the low mcm <dig> expression g <dig> cluster precedes the high expression g <dig> cluster
to formally test the previous statement, we serum starved bj <dig> and rpe <dig> cells then stimulated them with media containing 10% serum. after  <dig> hours serum starvation, close to 100% of the cells are in the low mcm <dig> expression g <dig> cluster . as early as  <dig> hours after serum stimulation, residence in the high expression g <dig> cluster has increased for rpe <dig>  for bj <dig>  this can be seen as early as  <dig> h . kinetic analysis  shows that the low expression g <dig> cluster decreases after serum stimulation as a function of time while the high expression g <dig> cluster increases, followed by an increase in s phase cells. for bj <dig> cells, the mcm <dig> levels in the low expression g <dig> cluster were distributed more narrowly with a lower center value, and therefore the identification of the boundary between the low and high clusters is more dramatic and easier to identify. however, the same pattern prevails in both cell lines. in experiments where the cells were sampled at later time points, from  <dig> to  <dig> h, the cells continued through s and g2/m phases in a semi-synchronous fashion. note that the predicted time for 50% of the cells to enter the high cluster is  <dig> hours for bj <dig> and  <dig> hours for rpe, and the time for 50% of the cells to enter s is  <dig> hours for bj <dig> and  <dig> hours for rpe. thus, at least under these conditions, residence in the high expression cluster is short compared to movement from the low expression cluster, as would be expected for uncommitted and committed g <dig> states.

presence of mcm <dig> in the low expression g <dig> cluster
the presence of mcm <dig> in the low expression g <dig> cluster is supported by western blot of serum starved bj <dig> cells. bj <dig> cells were serum starved for  <dig> h before extraction with triton x- <dig>  washing, then lysate formation . both mcm <dig> and pcna decreased in serum starved cells. the relatively strong level of mcm <dig> compared to pcna at  <dig> h of serum starvation indicates that the low mcm <dig> population is not "essentially negative" for mcm <dig> expression, but rather, distinctly positive. therefore, we conclude that the low expression cluster of cells have loaded mcm proteins. different levels of quiescence can be achieved by serum starvation protocols. while the average time to s phase after stimulation may not be affected, the protein expression profile can be  <cit> . our serum starvation experiments for bj <dig> cells achieved an average of 95% of cells in g <dig>  we did not growth arrest by confluence first. therefore, our results do not say anything about true g <dig> cells and the expression of loaded mcm proteins but do show that the low expression clusters in actively dividing cells are positive for loaded mcm proteins.

serum starvation functionally separates the bound-mcm states of g1
the restriction point  divides activated, uncommitted cells from those that are committed to the cell cycle. cells that have not passed through "r" are not committed and arrest in g <dig> when serum or nutrients are withdrawn. cells that are beyond r are committed to the cell cycle and behave like s, g <dig>  and m cells - that is, when serum or nutrients are withdrawn, they complete the current cell cycle and the daughter cells arrest in the next g <dig>  here, we will refer to the uncommitted cells as g1a and the committed cells as g1p to distinguish them from g1pm and g1ps of zetterberg  <cit>  and various uses of g1a and g1b, since each nomenclature is defined by a measurement system.

to test whether the high mcm <dig> g <dig> cluster was equivalent to g1p cells, we changed the growth media on actively dividing bj <dig> and rpe <dig> cultures to media containing  <dig> % fbs, and then tracked the changes in the low and high mcm <dig> g <dig> clusters and the s phase fraction. figure  <dig> shows g <dig> and s data for bj <dig> cells. . the regions used to calculate the percentage of g1a , g1p , and s  are color coded in two parameter plots of pcna versus mcm <dig> . the middle row shows histograms for mcm <dig> expression of g <dig> cells only, illustrating the decreasing frequency of g1p cells as a function of time. while there was clear evidence of a bimodal mcm <dig> distribution in g <dig> at t =  <dig> h for bj <dig> cells, there was no clear nadir. therefore, the regions were set at the point where the slope of the frequency histogram first approaches zero on the right side of the dim population at t =  <dig> h. this setting was not sensitive to minor changes, and the behavior of each population was tested by setting a gap of varying width between the two regions and repeating the measures. as early as  <dig> h after serum withdrawal, the low mcm <dig> g <dig> fraction began to increase and the population of high mcm <dig> cells declined, suggesting that r is at the junction of these  <dig> populations. these changes continued as a function of time, and for bj <dig> cells the process was complete by  <dig> h when 96% of the cells were resident in the low mcm <dig> g <dig> cluster. the bottom row shows histograms for pcna expression for both g <dig> and s cells, demonstrating the coordinated decrease in the fractions of g1p and s phase cells with time.

inhibitor studies
because it is apparent that g1a cells lose mcm <dig> fluorescence as a function of time in  <dig> % serum, and presumably this equates to loss of pre-rc complexes, we needed to address the possibility that tentative g1p cells in both cell lines lost mcm <dig> expression - i.e., moved backwards into the low mcm <dig> cluster, rather than having progressed into s. to address this, we used cell cycle inhibitors.

mimosine blocks the cell cycle at late g <dig> and s if added to asynchronous cultures  <cit> . mimosine at  <dig> Î¼g/ml  was added to bj <dig> cells at the time of serum withdrawal and cells were harvested after  <dig> h. pcna immunofluorescence was significantly reduced in the presence of mimosine . because of this we could not readily distinguish the high mcm <dig> g <dig> cluster from early s phase, and therefore used mcm <dig> versus dna plots to quantify g1p + early s  cells. analysis presented in figure 7a shows that in the absence of serum the frequency of g1p+es cells decreased in bj <dig> cultures but in the presence of mimosine it increased slightly relative to control cells in 10% serum at t =  <dig> h. this is consistent with a late g <dig> and s phase block. we conclude that high mcm <dig> g <dig> cluster bj <dig> cells did not significantly progress into s but did not move backwards to the low mcm <dig> g <dig> cluster either.

aphidicolin inhibits dna elongation but not initiation of dna primer formation by inhibiting dna polymerase Î´/Îµ  <cit> , therefore, it blocks the progression of cells beyond early s phase and any cells already in s phase are immobilized. at the same time serum was removed from cycling cultures of bj <dig> cells, aphidicolin at  <dig> Î¼g/ml was added. the results are shown in figure 7b. cells in the early s compartment  decreased during serum starvation but increased during serum starvation in the presence of aphidicolin. essentially the same results were determined with rpe <dig> cells . this indicates that cells within the high mcm <dig> g <dig> cluster moved into early s rather than to the low mcm <dig> state.

nocodazole inhibits polymerization of tubulin and thus prevents formation of the mitotic spindle by inhibiting microtubule elongation. when nocodazole at  <dig> ng/ml was added to bj <dig> cells at the start of serum withdrawal, the low mcm <dig> cluster  did not change . cells were prevented from entering g1a by the nocodazole block in m, and they were prevented from leaving by serum withdrawal.

the mimosine, aphidicolin, and nocodazole data confirm the uni-directional flow of cells through g <dig> phase. when serum is removed, the high mcm <dig> cluster g <dig> cells don't return to a low mcm <dig> state, but rather continue on and accumulate in early s in the presence of aphidicolin or mimosine. cells only enter the low mcm <dig> g <dig> state from mitosis and this entry is blocked in the presence of nocodazole. therefore, the low mcm <dig> state in g <dig> is equivalent to g1a and the high mcm <dig> state in g <dig> is equivalent to g1p.

discussion
earlier results from friedrich et al. suggested that in cv- <dig> cells g <dig> might be subdivided by the expression of low and high levels of chromatin loaded mcm proteins  <cit> . to ask whether this subdivision demarked uncommitted and committed g <dig>  we developed a cytometric assay that included dapi to stain dna and antibodies reactive with mcm <dig>  pcna, phospho-s10-histone h <dig>  pcna was included to cleanly separate s phase from late g <dig>  it was previously known that g <dig> cells would have minimal levels of bound mcm proteins but loading of pre-rcs begins in late mitosis, and therefore, we included a mitotic marker. this  <dig> color assay clearly showed in three human cell lines  that in actively replicating cells, g <dig> is subdivided into at least two states characterized by low and high levels of loaded mcm <dig> . we showed that the low level expression state is variable with respect to the average or modal levels that are expressed. we suspect that this variability is related to the rate of g <dig> transit , and we suspect that the high levels are relatively constant, but neither of these ideas have been tested rigorously. further, we showed by cytometric analysis of serum stimulation experiments, serum withdrawal experiments, and stathmokinetic experiments that the low level state is correlated with the uncommitted g <dig> state and that cell cycle commitment is correlated with the high level state. finally, we observed the lowest expression of bound mcm <dig> in mitotic cells . we did not see any evidence of bimodality in mitotic cells, and therefore the pre-rcs that are bound in mitosis are below the level of detection in this assay.

for this study, we have treated g <dig> as composed of two states defined by levels mcm levels. however, during this study we observed distributions of mcm <dig> in g <dig> with more structure than this simplified view. at a minimum, we could model g <dig> as composed of a basal population equal to the mitotic cells with the lowest levels of bound mcm proteins, a center population with a variable modal level of bound mcm proteins, and finally a high population with maximum levels of bound mcm proteins. the mitotic lowest population should set the biological bottom; the variable center population should vary with growth conditions, and the maximum population should define the levels necessary to enter s phase . our results concur with friedrich et al. in that the level of mcm proteins detected in the high mcm cluster appear to be equivalent to the highest levels achieved in cell populations fixed and stained for both bound and unbound mcm proteins. this may mean that at equilibrium, at the g <dig> â†’ s transition, all the mcm proteins that can be bound are bound. if that speculation proves to be true, then it would be interesting to know whether the max levels of mcm proteins fluctuate as a function of growth rate as well as the center population. support for any of these speculative remarks will require significant further experimentation.

mukherjee at al.  <cit>  have correlated high levels of bound mcm proteins, cdc <dig>  hyper-phosphorylated rb, and cyclin e expression with the committed period of g <dig>  they showed that synchronized cell populations  treated with rna polymerase ii inhibitors were not arrested during a period when most cells would be in late g <dig>  and therefore, these parameters were correlated with cell cycle commitment. these results are in agreement with the findings of chuang et al. for stimulated quiescent human epithelial cells that assign cdc <dig> binding, mcm loading, and cdc <dig> expression to late g <dig>  dependent on cyclin e activity  <cit> . our data are in agreement with both of these studies, but further illustrate that even in actively cycling cells there is a measureable period in late g <dig> in which mcm proteins are maximally bound to chromatin. further, our results strongly suggest that this period is universally passed through prior to pcna loading and the start of s phase in human somatic cells. our data do not address the conclusion from both papers that loading occurs solely in late g <dig>  we have focused on actively dividing asynchronous cells - an area that cytometry addresses well. we have presented a starve and stimulate experiment in figure  <dig> for htert immortalized human fibroblasts and epithelial cells. as stated in the text associated with figure  <dig>  our starvation experiments were performed to determine the sequence of mcm loading from low to high, and it is likely that we have not worked with cells as deeply quiescent as either mukerjee et al. or chuang et al.

the low to high sequence of mcm expression in g <dig> may seem obvious from primary asynchronous data as shown by friedrich et al  <cit>  and more explicitly in this paper ). nevertheless, it was necessary to test the hypothesis. single static samples of the type presented in figure  <dig> could arise from a more complex expression program than "basal â†’ max â†’ basal" and that complexity would become obvious in experiments like that in figure  <dig> 

any conclusion about ori loading rests on the assumption that all or most of the bound mcm proteins are associated with ori. in mammalian cells, origins of replication are not well defined , and therefore comprehensive temporal licensing studies have not been done. more mcm proteins are bound relative to the number of bound orc complexes and most mcm proteins do not co-localize with replication forks or with orc . there is some evidence that much of the excess mcm loading is related to dormant ori that respond to replication fork stalling  <cit> . in contrast to higher eukaryotes, significant progress has been made in yeast toward identifying all origins  using genome-wide information and technologies  <cit> . in s. pombe, which has defined and known origins without consensus sequences, there is a distribution of the efficiency with which origins are used during s phase . high frequency origins are used often  and lower efficiency origins are used less  . there also appears to be a hierarchal order of orc binding beginning in mitosis according to origin efficiency that appears at least partly dependent on affinity  <cit> . in s. pombe, evidence suggests that high efficiency origins are bound early and low efficiency origins are bound late and that this order is followed by mcm loading and subsequently cdc <dig> loading  <cit> . therefore, at least in actively dividing somatic cells, the possibilities are that low efficiency and/or dormant origins are licensed in the g1p state . alternatives are that no particular origins are licensed during this period or more complex scenarios coupled with transcription promoter sites could be entertained. it seems like genome-wide efforts will be required to determine whether these ideas have any merit. since cells resident in this cytometrically defined, high mcm g <dig> state could be sorted, perhaps facs coupled with genome-wide technologies  could provide comprehensive answers.

it is clear from our data that mcm binding occurs throughout g <dig> in both quiescence-stimulation experiments and in actively cycling populations. it is probable, that in our serum starvation experiments we did not achieve "deep" quiescence  and that in true g <dig> cells , most of the binding occurs during late g <dig>  even in our experiments , the mcm levels of the g1p cells is ~ <dig> fold greater than that of the g1a cells, which would lead one to conclude that most of the loading occurs in late g <dig> during cell cycle re-entry, whereas it is less clear in actively dividing cells. the mcm levels are ~ <dig> fold higher in g1p bj <dig> than g1a , and ~ <dig> fold higher in rpe g1p compared to g1a . however in molt <dig> the levels of the two states are distinctly different with almost all of the loading occurring in g1p whether or not the population is growing slow or fast. these are also lymphoma cells, and therefore, deregulation of g <dig> progression is highly probable. however, in other analyses , we have observed clear evidence of non-linear loading in g <dig>  i.e., a large fraction of g1a cells separated from a large fraction of g1p cells as we observed for molt <dig> cells . this can be thought of as a switch from a low loading rate to a high loading rate at the time of switching from uncommitted to committed g <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our data support the idea that mitotic cells represent the lowest bound mcm levels in actively cycling cells; that the rate of chromatin loading in uncommitted g <dig> cells is variable, and that committed g <dig> cells are characterized by a maximum level achieved just prior to s. the modal level of binding in an asynchronous, actively cycling population appears to be higher in fast replicating populations and lower in slower replicating populations. this supports the idea that the differences in rates of loading between cycling cells and stimulated g <dig> cells is a continuum and dependent on the rates of synthesis and activation of cyclin e and cdk <dig> for re-entry and perhaps d cyclins and cdk4/ <dig>  as suggested by chuang et al.  <cit> .
