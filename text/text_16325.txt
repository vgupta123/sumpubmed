BACKGROUND
elevated low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol, reduced high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol, and increased triglyceride levels significantly contribute to the accumulation of lipids in atherosclerotic lesions. reverse cholesterol transport is believed to be crucial for preventing atherogenesis and hence the development of cardiovascular diseases  <cit> . it is commonly accepted that the atp-binding cassette protein, abca <dig> plays a pivotal role in the initial steps of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway by mediating the interactions of amphiphilic apolipoproteins  with cellular lipids to generate nascent hdl particles thus removing excess cellular cholesterol  <cit> . mutations in abca <dig> cause tangier disease, a disorder characterized by very low hdl levels, cholesterol deposition in macrophages, and premature atherosclerosis  <cit> . there is increasing evidence suggesting a role for abca <dig> not only in the hepatic but also in the intestinal hdl-production  <cit> .

therapeutic efforts to raise hdl levels with different drugs have been promising. clinical trials tested various statins, niacin, and ezetimibe alone and in various combinations to raise plasma hdl- and to reduce the plasma ldl-cholesterol levels  <cit> . niacin and ezetimibe together with statins were proven to be the most effective combination in vivo  <cit> . however, conflicting results were reported about the effects of statins on lipid efflux and the modulation of abca <dig> expression in in vitro experiments  <cit> . recently, certain types of calcium channel blockers , e.g., verapamil, nifedipine, have been found to be anti-atherogenic in clinical trials  <cit> . when their effects on abca <dig> expression were investigated, contradictory results were obtained. these agents either increased abca <dig> mrna levels or elevated the protein expression without affecting the mrna level, depending on the cellular test system used  <cit> .

similar to other plasma membrane proteins, the cell surface expression of abca <dig> is modulated by a complex process, which includes transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, as well as internalization, degradation, and recycling  <cit> . there is evidence that not only sufficient plasma membrane expression but internalization along with apoa-i is required for proper function of abca <dig>  <cit> . thus, in the present study we aimed to develop a quantitative in vitro test system, which is suitable for monitoring the plasma membrane level of abca <dig>  independently from direct transcriptional regulation. in order to generate such an experimental tool, we introduced a hemagglutinin  epitope into the first extracellular loop of abca <dig>  and stably expressed this tagged abca <dig> in various mammalian cell lines, using a constitutive promoter. in addition, to make our method suitable for studying trafficking processes of abca <dig> in conjunction with its function, we generated different loss-of-function mutant variants of the ha-tagged transporter. in the present study we demonstrate the applicability and reliability of the developed cellular test system, and report the effects of several pharmaceuticals, which are known to have cholesterol-lowering effects in vivo. when studying whether they act through modifying the cell surface expression of functional abca <dig>  we found that among several drugs, ezetimibe lowers the plasma membrane level of a functional abca <dig> 

RESULTS
stable expression of ha-tagged abca <dig> variants in mammalian cells
since we aimed to generate different cell lines stably expressing abca <dig> at moderate levels, we used a bicistronic retroviral vector containing abca <dig> and a neo-resistance gene  as described in  <cit> . in order to make our model system suitable for monitoring the cell surface appearance of abca <dig>  we introduced an ha epitope into the first extracellular loop of abca <dig>  <cit> . in addition to the ha-tagged wild type  abca <dig>  we generated three mutant variants containing a methionine-lysine substitution in either one or both walker a motifs . these loss-of-function mutations were shown to impair cholesterol efflux and apoa-i binding without affecting protein folding and intracellular routing  <cit> . the assemblies of various retroviral constructs are shown in figure  <dig>  retroviral particles were generated by using ecotropic phoenix and pg <dig> packaging cells as described in the materials and methods section. thereafter mdckii and hek293h cells were transduced and selected with g <dig> for stable expression of the transgenes  <cit> .

it has been previously reported that abca <dig> expression rapidly declines in transfected cells after a few passages  <cit> . in order to obtain a model system with stable expression of each ha-tagged abca <dig> variant at comparable levels, we applied two strategies: i) four different clones with similar expression levels were combined; or ii) the cells, showing similar ha staining, were sorted by facs. the former method  was used for the transduced mdckii cells; whereas the latter  was used for hek293h cells. the abca <dig> mrna expression level of the established cell lines was determined by quantitative rt-pcr, and compared to that of hepg <dig> cells, macrophage model cells, i.e. pma-pretreated thp- <dig> cells, and human monocyte-derived macrophages . we found that abca <dig> was moderately over-expressed in our cell lines ; nevertheless the expression levels were comparable with that of macrophages induced by the lxr agonist, t <dig> . the protein expression level in the generated cell lines was also monitored through several passages by western blot analysis . stable transgene expression was found up to  <dig> and  <dig> passages in mdckii and hek293h cells, respectively.

cellular localization and functional characterization of ha-tagged abca <dig> variants
besides analyzing the total expression levels, we also studied the cellular localization of abca <dig> variants in the established cell lines. in the first set of experiments indirect immunofluorescent labeling with anti-ha antibody was performed in intact cells, and cell surface staining was detected by flow cytometry. we found comparable plasma membrane expression levels of all abca <dig> variants in both mdckii and hek293h cells . similar to total expression levels of abca <dig> variants, the cell surface expression was also unaffected up to  <dig> and  <dig> passages in mdckii and hek293h cells, respectively.

the subcellular localization of ha-tagged abca <dig> variants was also studied by immunofluorescent staining followed by confocal microscopy. detailed subcellular localization analysis performed with hek293h cells clearly demonstrated that the ha-tagged abca <dig> is expressed predominantly in the plasma membrane . a minor intracellular ha-abca <dig> expression was found in the golgi-apparatus , and some degree of colocalization was seen with an endosomal marker . the subcellular localization of the ha-tagged abca <dig> variants was also studied in polarized mdckii. staining of na+/k+ atpase was used as a basolateral plasma membrane marker. similar to previous reports on the untagged protein  <cit> , the ha-tagged wt abca <dig> was also localized to the basolateral membrane compartment , indicating that neither the modest overexpression nor ha-tagging affect proper localization. similarly, all non-functional ha-tagged abca <dig> variants exhibited basolateral localization .

to investigate the functional properties of our ha-tagged abca <dig> variants, we measured the apoa-i-dependent cholesterol efflux and apoa-i binding in the established model cells. in accordance with previous observations with the untagged protein  <cit> , abca <dig> expression significantly elevated the apoa-i-specific cholesterol efflux in both hek293h and mdckii cells . more importantly, no difference was observed between the untagged and the ha-tagged abca <dig> in this respect. it is noteworthy that the observed apoa-i-dependent cholesterol efflux was smaller in our case than in preceding reports, most likely due to the moderated abca <dig> expression in our cells versus the massive overexpresssion in the transient expression systems used in previous studies. the apoa-i-dependent cholesterol effluxes from cells expressing the km, km, or mm mutants were not significantly different from that seen in the parental cells.

similar to apoa-i-dependent cholesterol efflux, apoa-i binding was found to be elevated in cells expressing either the untagged or ha-tagged abca <dig>  whereas it was unaffected in cells expressing the mutant form of ha-abca <dig> . since the calpain inhibitor acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucinal  and cylcosporin a  were used in further experiments, we investigated the effect of these drugs on the apoa-i-binding in the established cell lines. we found that alln significantly increased apoa-i-binding in cells expressing either the untagged or ha-tagged wt abca1-expressing, whereas csa pretreatment slightly reduced the apoa-i-binding in these cells. this observation is in good accordance with previous studies performed with untagged abca <dig>  <cit> , and clearly indicates that ha-tagging did not alter the function of the protein. alln and csa had no significant effect on apoai-binding in the parental cell line and in cell expressing the mutant form of ha-abca <dig> 

in summary, we demonstrated reasonable and stable expression, correct subcellular localization, as well as proper function for the ha-tagged abca <dig>  since all three ha-tagged abca <dig> mutants were proven to be non-functional with normal expression and localization, only the wild type ha-tagged and the double mutant variant  were used in further experiments.

effect of calpain inhibitor, bfa, and apoa-i on cell surface expression of abca <dig> variants
in order to demonstrate the applicability of the ha-tagged abca <dig> variants for monitoring cell surface expression, we studied the effect of different substances which are known to influence abca <dig> trafficking and degradation. since calpain has been shown to participate in abca <dig> degradation  <cit> , the ha-abca1-expressing cells were treated with the calpain inhibitor, alln. this drug was expected to elevate the cell surface expression of abca <dig> due to the inhibition of the degradation pathway. to decrease the cell surface appearance of the protein, brefeldin a , an inhibitor of trans-golgi transport  <cit>  was applied. indirect immunofluorescent labeling with anti-ha antibody was performed with intact cells  <dig> h after the treatment with alln and bfa, then studied by flow cytometry. figures 7a and 7b show representative experiments with hek293h cells expressing wt and mm variant of the ha-tagged abca <dig>  quantitative results are depicted in figures 7c and 7d. a substantial alteration in the cell surface expression of both variants was observed as compared to non-treated cells. alln caused about  <dig> -fold increase, whereas bfa treatment resulted in 60% reduction in the plasma membrane level of wt ha-abca <dig> . it is of note that the effects of drugs were slightly smaller in cells expressing the mm variant of ha-abca <dig> as compared to cells expressing the wt ha-abca <dig> . similar to bfa, a general protein synthesis blocker, cycloheximide also reduced the cell surface expression of both abca <dig> variants; however, this drug substantially affected cell viability .

apoa-i has also been demonstrated to increase abca <dig> expression by binding to the transporter and preventing it from degradation  <cit> . as expected, apoa-i significantly increased the cell surface expression of wt ha-tagged abca <dig> . the mm mutant abca <dig>  which was shown to be unable to bind apoa-i  <cit> , exhibited no alteration of the cell surface expression levels when incubated with apoa-i . these experiments clearly demonstrate that our model system is suitable to detect the effects of various substances on the cell surface expression of either the functional or non-functional variant of abca <dig> 

in similar experiments, ha-abca1-expressing mdckii cells were treated with alln or bfa. even though a wide range of drug concentrations was tested, no marked changes in the abca <dig> cell surface expression were seen in these cells. therefore, in further experiments hek293h cells expressing the ha-tagged abca <dig> variants were used.

effect of different drugs on cell surface expression of abca <dig> variants
by having a verified test system, we studied the effect of various drugs on the cell surface expression of abca <dig> variants. we primarily tested the effect of pharmaceuticals which are known to have cholesterol-lowering effects in vivo, to see whether they also act through modifying the cell surface appearance of abca <dig>  these drugs included atorvastatin, ezetimibe, and niacin  <cit> , 40- <dig>  as well as calcium channel blockers, nifedipine and verapamil  <cit> . in addition, we investigated the effect of cyclosporin a and glyburide, which have previously been reported to influence the plasma membrane level or function of abca <dig>  <cit> . the studied drugs were applied in a wide concentration range with various incubation times. as positive controls, alln and bfa were used to elevate and reduce the abca <dig> cell surface expression, respectively. the results are summarized in table  <dig> 

we found that atorvastatin , niacin , verapamil  and nifedipine  had no significant effect on the plasma membrane level of abca <dig> even in a wide concentration range. however, csa  substantially elevated the cell surface expression of wt ha-abca <dig>  in accordance with previous results indicating abca <dig> sequestration in the plasma membrane by csa  <cit> . it has not been shown yet whether this effect of csa is associated with the protein function, therefore we performed similar experiments with the non-functional mutant  variant of abca <dig>  we found that csa equally increased the abca <dig> cell surface expression in wt and mm ha-abca1-expressing cells , thus the trapping effect of csa is independent from abca <dig> function. unexpectedly, ezetimibe , a blocker of the intestinal cholesterol absorption, significantly  reduced the cell surface expression of wt ha-abca <dig> . interestingly, this effect of ez was found to be associated with abca <dig> function, since no reduction in the cell surface expression of the mm ha-abca <dig> was seen in response to ez treatment . glyburide, which has previously been reported to inhibit abca1-mediated cholesterol efflux and apoa-i binding without altering the cell surface levels or total protein levels of abca <dig>  <cit> , had no effect of the plasma membrane level of abca <dig> . however, at higher concentrations a slight reduction in the abca <dig> cell surface expression was observed in parallel with a substantial decline in the cell viability in both wt and mm ha-abca1-expressing cells. treatment with 200- <dig> μm glyburide for  <dig> h resulted in 50% cell death in both cell types.

we also investigated the effect of plasma membrane cholesterol levels on the cell surface expression of abca <dig> variants. treatment with  <dig> - <dig>  mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin , which results in membrane cholesterol depletion  <cit> , had no effect on the plasma membrane level of either wild type or mm variant of ha-abca <dig> even in a wide range of incubation time , although a substantial reduction in the cell viability was observed. similarly, cholesterol overload by cholesterol-containing cd treatment  did not alter the cell surface expression of abca <dig> in either cell type.

discussion
abca <dig> protein is involved in lipid metabolism in several regards. this protein promotes reverse cholesterol transport from the peripheral tissues. abca <dig>  being located on the basolateral surface of hepatocytes and intestinal cells, has been shown to play a crucial role in the hepatic and intestinal secretion of hdl  <cit> . in the present study we generated and characterized a model system for the quantitative assessment of the plasma membrane level of abca <dig>  inclusion of an extracellular hemagglutinin epitope into abca <dig> enabled monitoring of its cell surface expression by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. by using retroviral transduction we established mammalian cell lines stably expressing functional and non-functional ha-tagged abca <dig> variants. this experimental tool allowed us to investigate the effect of different drugs on cell surface expression of abca <dig> 

in previous studies, the protein expression level and subcellular localization of wild type abca <dig> and non-functional mutant forms were found to be identical  <cit> . similarly, in our model system, both the overall and the plasma membrane expression levels of each ha-tagged abca <dig> variant were comparable, as determined by western blotting and cell surface labeling . abca <dig> has been reported to be localized to the basolateral membrane in polarized cells  <cit> . we found proper subcellular localization for each ha-tagged abca <dig> variant  in accordance with previous reports on the untagged versions of the transporter  <cit> .

since the applicability and reproducibility of a cellular model system requires stable protein expression levels, we investigated the persistence of our transgene in various cell lines. we found that abca <dig> expression remains stable in mdckii and hek293h cells up to  <dig> and  <dig> passages, respectively. thus, our experimental test system substantially surpasses previous attempts to generate cellular models with abca <dig>  since in those cases protein expression rapidly declined after a few passages  <cit> . we demonstrated the applicability of our system to assess the cell surface appearance of abca <dig> by using bfa and alln, which have been reported to influence abca <dig> trafficking and degradation .

in agreement with previous reports  <cit> , we demonstrated the stabilizing effect of apoa-i on the ha-tagged abca <dig> at the cell surface . furthermore, we found that the cell surface levels of the walker motif mutant abca <dig> , which fails to bind apoa-i   <cit> , was unaffected by apoa-i . this observation is in line with previous findings demonstrating that binding of apoa-i is required for the apoa-i-mediated increase of abca <dig> expression  <cit> .

in clinical trials, statins were highly effective in reducing ldl-cholesterol, but only moderate effects were seen on the hdl levels. among a number of different statins, atorvastatin was the most effective and induced redistribution in hdl subpopulations by increasing the fraction of larger hdl particles  <cit> . conflicting results were published on the effect of statins on abca <dig> expression and lipid efflux in various cellular systems. wong et al. demonstrated down-regulation of abca <dig> mrna and protein levels as well as reduction in the apoa-i-mediated cholesterol efflux in response to statin treatment of pma-induced thp- <dig> cells  <cit> . in contrast, another study found that atorvastatin increased mrna expression of abca <dig> and promoted cholesterol efflux in the same cell type  <cit> . in hepatoma cells, statins induced abca <dig> expression resulting in cholesterol and phospholipid efflux to apoa-i  <cit> . these observations leave the question open, whether statins influence apoa-i-dependent cholesterol efflux solely by changing abca <dig> expression levels or by modifying its subcellular trafficking and cell surface appearance. since our model system excludes transcriptional regulation, our results revealed that atorvastatin has no effect on the plasma membrane expression of abca <dig> 

niacin has been reported to be one of the most potent agents increasing hdl cholesterol levels  <cit> , and to stimulate abca <dig> expression and function in monocytic cell lines via influencing the camp/pka pathway  <cit> . by investigating the effect of niacin in our system, we observed no direct effect on cell surface appearance of abca <dig> in accordance with previous observations on the regulatory mechanism of niacin.

calcium channel blockers have also been reported to influence abca <dig> expression. hasegawa et al. demonstrated the role of different signaling pathways including pka, tyrosine kinase, and janus kinase in abca <dig> expression modulation in response to various ccbs. they found that some of the ccbs, e.g., aranidipine and efonidipine, increase abca <dig> protein expression without altering the mrna level  <cit> . in contrast, suzuki et al. demonstrated a dose-dependent stimulatory effect of other ccbs, such as verapamil, nifedipine, and nicardipine, on both the mrna and protein expression levels of abca <dig>  resulting in elevated cellular lipid release  <cit> . our results do not support these findings, since we observed no significant effect on the plasma membrane level of abca <dig> in a wide concentration range of verapamil and nifedipine.

membrane cholesterol has been implicated to regulate many membrane proteins, including several abc transporters, e.g. abcb <dig> and abcg <dig>  <cit> . membrane microdomains with high cholesterol content have been suggested to play a role in such regulation  <cit> . however, neither cholesterol overload nor depletion influenced abca <dig> cell surface expression in our model system. it is noteworthy that treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin  reduced, whereas cholesterol-loaded cd significantly increased cell viability. the most plausible explanation for this observation is that cd treatment makes the cell membrane fragile and more sensitive to mechanical stress. this notion should be taken in account in future studies on abca1-expressing cells treated with cd.

we studied the effect of glyburide and csa, which have previously been reported to influence the plasma membrane level or function of abca <dig>  <cit> . in accordance with previous observations, glyburide had no effect on abca <dig> plasma membrane appearance in our model system  <cit> , whereas csa greatly increased the cell surface level of abca <dig> . alln elevated both abca <dig> cell surface expression and apoa-i binding, whereas csa reduced apoa-i binding despite the increased plasma membrane level of abca <dig>  this observation is line with a previous report suggesting that csa sequesters abca <dig> in the plasma membrane  <cit> . the observation that cell surface expression of the non-functional abca <dig> mutant  is also increased by csa pretreatment clearly indicates that the trapping effect of this drug is independent from abca <dig> function.

ezetimibe, a drug which is known to block the intestinal cholesterol absorption, has not only an inhibitory effect on several brush border membrane proteins, including niemann-pick c1-like  <dig>  scavenger receptor b-i and cd <dig>  <cit> , but has also been reported to lower the mrna level of several other genes involved in lipid metabolism. the transcription of abca <dig> is also reduced by ez  <cit> , but no study has yet been reported on its effect on the cell surface expression of abca <dig>  our model system allows us to investigate the plasma membrane expression of abca <dig> independently from its transcriptional regulation. strikingly, we found that ez significantly lowers the cell surface expression of wt ha-abca <dig> . since no reduction in the cell surface expression of the mm ha-abca <dig> was seen in response to ez treatment , the effect of ez occurs only with a functional abca <dig>  thus, its effect is likely connected to a functional form of the protein.

there are several possibilities to explain the lack of effect of ez on cell surface expression of the non-functional mm-abca <dig> variant. it is theoretically possible but very unlikely that ez inhibits the trafficking of only the de novo synthesized functional proteins. it is more plausible that ez influences the protein internalization and recycling to the plasma membrane, since abca <dig> has been shown to undergo a relatively rapid internalization and recycling to the plasma membrane, which process is widely accepted to require protein function  <cit> . therefore, if ez either accelerates protein internalization or inhibits recycling, and in the meantime mm-abca <dig> has a lower internalization and recycling turnover compared to wild type, ez causes a smaller effect on the cell surface appearance of the mutant transporter. this hypothesis is supported by the observation that the effects of alln were also smaller in ha-mm-abca1-expressing cells, as compared to wild type ha-abca <dig>  it is also possible that ez accelerates abca <dig> degradation, since the internalization itself is dependent on the transporter function. this idea is not supported by our recent observations using confocal microscopy, when we found that following ez treatment the wt ha-abca <dig>  but not the mm variant, accumulated intracellularly in vesicles but not in lysosomes . nevertheless, further studies are needed to reveal the mechanism of ez effect on the cell surface expression of abca <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in the current study, we have provided a model system suitable for the quantitative assessment of the plasma membrane level of abca <dig>  we have shown that this test system can be reliably applied for studying the effect of various pharmaceuticals on the cell surface expression of the transporter. therefore, our model system provides a new tool for acquiring more information on the post-translational regulation, internalization, degradation and recycling of the abca <dig> protein.
