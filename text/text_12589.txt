BACKGROUND
weaned piglets are subjected to many environmental, behavioural and dietary stresses. moreover, the intestinal gut flora is still precarious, which makes them highly susceptible to enteric diseases  <cit> . disease outbreaks in animal houses can lead to animal mortality and higher condemnation rates at slaughterhouses. the resulting economic damage can be severe  <cit>  together with preventive measures  and even destruction of farm animals  <cit> . in addition, foodborne zoonotic diseases are a significant and widespread global public health threat.

in nursery units, diarrhoea is one of the most important causes of economic losses in the pig industry. post-weaning diarrhoea is multifactorial but the proliferation of pathogenic escherichia coli strains throughout the intestinal tract of piglets after weaning has been shown to play a significant role  <cit> . another important pathogen for the pig industry is salmonella. in  <dig>  most of the reported food-borne outbreaks  in the european union were associated with food originating from animals. salmonella was the most frequently detected causative agent   <cit> .

methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus sequence type  <dig>  is an emerging opportunistic pathogen among farm animals, especially pigs . epidemiological studies have shown that they not only colonise pigs, but can also be transmitted to persons with direct livestock exposure. moreover, it is indicated that mrsa st <dig> represents an increasing cause of infections in humans  <cit> .

it is of great importance to prevent disease outbreaks through biosecurity measures rather than cure them  <cit> . biosecurity includes all measures that prevent pathogens from entering a herd  as well as reducing the spread of pathogens within the herd   <cit> . between production cycles, internal biosecurity measures such as cleaning, disinfection and a vacancy period are applied. every biosecurity measure can influence the degree of infection pressure before new animals arrive.

luyckx et al.  <cit>  showed that a cleaning step in broiler houses caused a reduction of total aerobic flora by  <dig> log cfu/625 cm <dig> and that a disinfection step caused a further reduction of  <dig>  log cfu. in piglet nursery units, the importance of a prolonged vacancy period is unknown. the aim of the present study was to assess the evolution of the bacterial load of total aerobic flora, enterococcus spp., e. coli, faecal coliforms and mrsa during a 10-day vacancy period in piglet nursery units. enterococcus spp. and faecal coliforms are suggested to be adequate hygiene-indicator organisms for faecal contamination of surfaces. in addition, e. coli have been shown to be suitable index organisms for monitoring the possible presence of salmonella .

RESULTS
before disinfection, the mean enumeration of total aerobic flora was  <dig>  log cfu/625 cm <dig> . the proportion of positive samples for e. coli, faecal coliforms and mrsa  and enterococcus spp. was  <dig>   <dig> and 16 %  and 95 % , respectively.fig.  <dig> mean enumeration of total aerobic flora with standard errors. mean enumerations are given for each sampling moment  and location after disinfection . samples  were taken before disinfection  and 1 day , 4 days , 7 days  and 10 days  after disinfection. samples  were taken from each location. significant differences between sampling moments/ locations are indicated by different letters above bars

on day  <dig> after disinfection, mean enumeration of total aerobic flora was significantly reduced to  <dig>  log cfu/625 cm <dig>  . of the  <dig> samples taken on day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 7 % were positive for e. coli, faecal coliforms and mrsa detection, respectively . in addition, 69 % of the samples gave countable results for enterococcus spp. . the proportion of positive samples for e. coli, faecal coliforms and enterococcus spp. was significantly lower compared to the proportions found before disinfection .

three days later , total aerobic flora were significantly reduced to  <dig>  log cfu/cm <dig> . only 7 % of the samples were positive for e. coli, but the number of positive samples found for faecal coliforms and mrsa were higher . countable results for enterococcus spp. also increased to 77 %.

on day  <dig> after disinfection, mean enumeration of total aerobic flora was  <dig>  log cfu/625 cm <dig>  of all samples,  <dig>   <dig> and 13 % were positive for e. coli, faecal coliforms and mrsa detection, respectively and comparable to day  <dig>  70 % of the samples gave countable results for enterococcus spp..

on day  <dig>  total aerobic flora increased further to  <dig>  log cfu/625 cm <dig>  which was  <dig>  log cfu more than 4 days after disinfection , but not significantly different from day  <dig>  proportion of positive samples for e. coli, faecal coliforms and mrsa were  <dig>   <dig> and 8 %, respectively. in addition, 79 % of the samples were countable for enterococcus spp..

overall, no significant differences were noticed between sampling moments after disinfection for e. coli, faecal coliforms, mrsa and enterococcus spp..

during the entire 10-day vacancy period, the overall contamination level  was the highest for drinking nipples   and the lowest for feeding troughs   . results of enterococcus spp. confirmed these observations  and also showed that the floors were still highly contaminated   . results for e. coli, faecal coliforms and mrsa did not indicate the most critical locations after cleaning and disinfection  .

during the vacancy period, mean temperature ranged from 15 °c to 16 °c and relative humidity  from  <dig> to 67 % . these two parameters did not have a significant effect on the different bacteriological parameters.fig.  <dig> mean temperature  and relative humidity  with standard deviations given per sampling moment. sampling moments: day  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  after disinfection




discussion
biosecurity measures, such as cleaning and disinfection  and a prolonged vacancy period of the animal houses are an essential part of the hygiene management on the farm to prevent disease outbreaks. the effect of a vacancy period of 10 days after disinfection on several bacteriological parameters was examined during this study.

disinfection reduced the total aerobic flora by  <dig>  log cfu/ sampling surface. during the following 10 day vacancy, only a small reduction was observed on day  <dig>  though this seemed microbiological negligible . one possible explanation for the observed small fluctuations and the decline of total aerobic flora on day  <dig> is that some bacteria can survive stressful conditions by entering a viable but nonculturable state  <cit> . these nonculturable bacteria were not enumerated nor detected by the methods used in this study. another possible explanation is that residual flora could proliferate again after disinfection, due to lack of niche and nutrient competition with other bacteria. these residual bacteria could have survived the disinfection step by the presence of a resistance mechanism  or by detrimental factors present during disinfection, such as residual organic material.

moreover, a longer vacancy period can even have a negative effect, not only financially because of a lower number of production cycles  but also bacteriologically. for example, recontamination could occur by vectors such as vermin and rodents in case of biosecurity breaches , especially when other compartments in the same building are still filled with animals or if residual organic material  is present after c&d. flies may be reservoirs and vectors of several bacteria such as salmonella  <cit> , e. coli o157:h <dig>  <cit> , staphylococcus aureus  <cit>  and streptococcus suis type  <dig>  <cit> . wild rodents can also carry pathogens such as salmonella, campylobacter, yersinia and mrsa st <dig> . as biosecurity measures are very well implemented on the pilot farm, it can be assumed that on other farms, the bacteriological load and infection pressure may even increase during vacancy.

some bacteria can survive for long periods under various conditions in the environment, such as salmonella, staphylococcus aureus  and enterococcus spp.  <cit> . the results from the present study indicate that a prolonged vacancy period without extra biosecurity measures creates no reduction in these bacteria. extra biosecurity measures such as specific pathogen control programs and pest control during the vacancy period could therefore be beneficial.

finally, the contamination levels of several locations were analysed during the vacancy period. drinking nipples were still mostly contaminated with total aerobic flora and enterococcus spp.. luyckx et al.  <cit>  showed that drinking cups are critical locations for c&d in broiler houses. drinking water from these contaminated sources could be a possible cause for disease in animals. therefore extra attention should be given to these locations during c&d and during the vacancy period. in addition, also disinfection of drinking lines is recommended as they can be contaminated with biofilms, including pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . as this study is carried out on an experimental farm, also other locations can be identified as critical locations for c&d, due to their different specific structural design or composition compared to the studied farm.

CONCLUSIONS
this study indicates that a vacancy period up to 10 days after cleaning and disinfection with no extra biosecurity measures has no beneficial effect on the bacterial load of total aerobic flora, e. coli, faecal coliforms, mrsa and enterococcus spp. in piglet nursery units.
