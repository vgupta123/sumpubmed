BACKGROUND
differential gene expression is responsible for morphological and phenotypical differences among animals, since the transcriptome is dynamic  <cit> . studies on how micronutrients affect gene expression will help to clarify the role of trace elements in health and metabolism and their connection to biochemical events  <cit> . the trace mineral zinc  is involved in gene expression in numerous ways including dna replication, rna transcription, through the activity of transcription factors, dna and rna polymerases, signal transduction, oxidative stress and playing a role in programmed cell death  <cit> . it was recently estimated that almost  <dig>  different proteins encoded by the human genome bind zinc  <cit> . an example of such proteins is metallothionein , which exerts a protective effect against stress by acting as an antioxidant, and as a zn storage and transfer protein  <cit> . furthermore, the transcriptional regulation of the mt gene by dietary zn has been demonstrated in rats  <cit> .

in developing countries zn deficiency is caused by ingestion of high cereal protein diets rich in phytic acid, an organic form of phosphorus   <cit> . in addition, common animal feedstuffs contain 60–80% of the total p in the phytic acid molecule, which make zn unavailable for absorption  <cit> . rats fed diets containing  <dig>  mg zn/kg and phytic acid absorb less and excrete more zn  <cit> . this may be explained by the formation of mineral-phytic acid complexes, plus the negligible amount of endogenous phytase production in mammals. therefore, the tendency to excrete phytic acid bound minerals in the feces is increased, and mineral absorption is decreased. phytase supplementation studies in pigs demonstrate increased plasma zn concentration  <cit> , greater zn retention  <cit> , and improved bone mineralization  <cit> , while adding phytase to human diets also results in increased iron absorption  <cit> . thus, phytase supplementation provides a potential solution to improve zn availability.

in humans, zn supplementation has been shown to reduce the morbidity of diarrhea  <cit> , respiratory disease  <cit> , and nematode infection  <cit> . moreover, high zn supplementation to weaned pigs has been successful in increasing growth and decreasing diarrhea  <cit> , while feeding pharmacological zn  to weaned pigs improves fecal consistency and also intestinal morphology by increasing villous height and reducing crypt depths of the duodenum and jejunum  <cit> . however, molecular analyses of the effects of pharmacological zn to explain the favorable symptoms observed when zn is supplemented in high quantities have not been undertaken.

we previously reported that feeding the recommended amounts of phytase  and pharmacological zn  to newly weaned pigs increased mt mrna abundance and protein concentrations in the liver, kidney and intestinal mucosa  <cit> . thus, additional genes are also likely to be affected by this dietary intervention and serve as the basis for the improved health effects obtained with pharmacological zn supplementation. therefore, the objective of this experiment was to determine the identity of genes that are differentially expressed in the liver of pigs fed diets with or without pharmacological zn, and to determine if phytase supplementation further affected gene expression by using differential display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  and oligonucleotide microarray technologies. in this paper we report  <dig> amplicons identified by ddrt-pcr and  <dig> annotated genes  identified by microarray analysis with putative differential gene expression, of which  <dig> transcripts with roles in oxidative stress reduction and amino acid metabolism were confirmed to have differential expression in pigs fed pharmacological zn diets.

RESULTS

a total of  <dig> putatively differentially expressed amplicons were cloned and sequenced. high quality nucleotide sequence data was obtained for  <dig> of these expressed sequence tags  and all were submitted to the genbank database . a search of the embl/genbank and tigr databases revealed that  <dig> of the ests  had significant similarities to genes with known identities,  <dig> were similar to mitochondrial dna , and the  <dig> remaining sequences  had unknown identities . identified genes were similar to genes involved in signal transduction , nucleic acid metabolism , oxidative stress response , protein and amino acid metabolism , blood coagulation , and structural roles . various mrna abundance patterns were observed among the dietary treatment groups  and  <dig> genes were selected for subsequent confirmation analyses.

identification of differentially expressed genes by oligonucleotide microarray analysis
to further monitor gene expression changes due to pharmacological zn supplementation, we conducted a transcriptional profiling analysis using a commercially available pig 70-mer oligonucleotide set spotted on glass slide microarrays. the hepatic transcript abundance patterns from animals fed  <dig> mg zn/kg  compared to animals fed  <dig>  mg zn/kg  revealed  <dig> annotated genes that were significantly altered at a false discovery rate  adjusted p ≤  <dig> , plus several hundred additional un-annotated oligonucleotides. several of these probes represent multiple spots of the same oligonucleotide. taking this into account, a total of  <dig> unique genes were identified as differentially expressed at fdr ≤  <dig>  in the microarray analysis . these genes have been categorized according to functional groups, and the file contains the oligonucleotide id, fold change, raw and adjusted p values, and annotation for each gene.

confirmation of differential expression as affected by dietary treatment
in the present study, we focused on genes differentially expressed due to pharmacological zn supplementation, and further evaluated if their expression was affected by phytase supplementation. a total of  <dig> genes were selected from the display gels and microarray hybridization results that exhibited different relative mrna abundance in the liver of pigs fed pharmacological zn diets without phytase  versus pigs fed zn <dig>  in addition to these  <dig> genes, an oligonucleotide for mt on the microarray was observed to exhibit a  <dig> -fold higher hepatic mrna abundance in pigs fed zn <dig> than in pigs fed zn <dig>  a result which we have already confirmed in our previous study where we reported hepatic mt mrna abundance and protein concentration to be significantly higher in pigs fed pharmacological zn diets than in pigs fed an adequate zn diet  <cit> . to confirm differential gene expression, a combination of relative real time rt-pcr and northern blot analyses were utilized with all  <dig> animals from exp.  <dig> , and all  <dig> animals of exp. <dig>  which were fed the six dietary treatments.

three oxidative stress response genes involved in the reduction of peroxides , detoxification of glycating agents , and transfer of glutathione , exhibited differential expression. northern blot analysis of prdx <dig> revealed a single transcript of ~ <dig>  kb , which agrees with the size reported for human prdx <dig>  <cit> . real time reverse transcription pcr  was used to examine mrna abundance of prdx <dig>  relative abundance of prdx <dig> mrna  in liver of pigs fed pharmacological zn diets was  <dig> fold higher in pigs fed zn <dig>  and  <dig> fold higher in pigs fed zn <dig> when compared to pigs fed zn <dig> . this result was supported by the subsequent microarray analysis which revealed significantly higher hybridization to a prdx <dig> oligonucleotide present on the array by the zn <dig> samples than by the zn <dig> samples .

pcr amplification efficiency plots revealed that gapdh was not a suitable normalizing gene for glo <dig>  therefore northern blot hybridization was performed for confirmation of glo <dig>  a single transcript  was observed , which was in accordance with the size of human glo <dig>  <cit> . relative glo <dig> mrna abundance was greater  in pigs fed pharmacological zn diets  when compared to pigs fed adequate zn . supplemental phytase did not affect the mrna abundance of either prdx <dig> or glo <dig> 

microarray analysis had indicated gstm <dig> mrna abundance to be higher in pigs fed zn <dig> than pigs fed zn <dig>  real time rt-pcr results for gstm <dig> supported a trend for zn <dig> pigs to have higher gstm <dig> mrna abundance, although it did not reach statistical significance due to large animal variability. there was a trend for significance  towards an interaction between zn and phytase supplementation for relative gstm <dig> mrna abundance. gstm <dig> mrna abundance tended to increase when phytase was supplemented to the diets of pigs fed adequate  or the first level of pharmacological zn . however, when phytase was supplemented with the higher level of pharmacological zn  no further increase in expression was observed.

n-aminoacylase i  and heat shock protein  <dig>   are genes involved in amino acid and heat shock metabolism that also displayed differential expression. northern blot analysis revealed the presence of a single acy <dig> transcript , which is in accordance with the size reported for pig acy <dig>  <cit> . relative acy <dig> mrna abundance was increased  in pigs fed pharmacological zn , and no phytase effect was observed . relative abundance of hsp <dig>  mrna in liver of pigs fed zn <dig> and zn <dig> diets was comparable and higher than in pigs fed zn <dig> . supplemental phytase did not affect the mrna abundance of hsp <dig> .

based on the differential display gels, an acute phase response gene, orosomucoid  <dig> , and a gene in the plasma carboxypeptidase family, carboxypeptidase b <dig> , also exhibited increased mrna abundance in pigs fed pharmacological zn diets. however, these genes were not confirmed to be differentially expressed in pigs fed any of the dietary treatments using relative real time rt-pcr due to large animal variability .

discussion
differential display reverse transcription pcr is a technique that allows the simultaneous comparison of multiple treatments for the identification of differentially regulated mrnas, and the generation of ests that can be compared with dna sequences available in current databases to identify genes, including genes in non-conventional biological models such as the pig  <cit> . the disadvantage of ddrt-pcr vs. microarray approaches is clearly that it is a much more time consuming technique to perform. however, ddrt-pcr does have some advantages. gene discovery with ddrt-pcr does not require prior knowledge of gene or est sequences as is needed for construction of microarrays  <cit> . in the present study, several genes selected for confirmation from the ddrt-pcr study were not present on the microarray used for subsequent analyses despite the relatively large number of oligonucleotides on the microarray . in addition, ddrt-pcr allows direct comparisons to be made between more than two samples at a time and it may be more sensitive for detection of relatively low abundance transcripts. for this study, ddrt-pcr and oligonucleotide microarray technologies were used to reveal differentially expressed genes in the liver of pigs fed pharmacological zn diets and to determine if expression was further affected when supplemental phytase was added to the diets. in total we found  <dig> ests with putative differential expression using ddrt-pcr among the various treatment groups and identified  <dig> differentially expressed  annotated genes with the microarray. seven genes were selected for confirmation. this study provides evidence of a differential hepatic transcriptional profile in pigs due to consumption of diets containing basal or pharmacological concentrations of zn.

the prdx <dig> gene encodes for a ubiquitous cytosolic enzyme , which reduces hydrogen peroxide via redox-active cysteine residues. in addition to hydrogen peroxides, jin and collaborators  <cit>  reported that peroxiredoxins can also regulate peroxide-mediated signaling cascades, and their overexpression reduces hydrogen peroxides in response to tumor necrosis factor α . overexpression of prdx <dig> in mice suppresses b-cell nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer  activation through regulation of b-cell inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer  phosphorylation  <cit> . gallagher and phelan reported that inhibition of nf-κb leads to an increase in prdx <dig> transcription in mouse hepatocytes  <cit> . similarly, mt has also been implicated in inhibiting tnf-induced activation of nf-κb dna binding, by inhibition of i-κb degradation and subsequent nf-κb suppression  <cit> . an in vitro study demonstrated that zn pretreatment increased the availability of intracellular zn ions and abrogated lps-induced oxidative stress and i-κb/nf-κb signaling cascade in liver kupffer cells  <cit> . kim et al.  <cit>  suggest that mt modulates intracellular signaling molecules such as transcription factors  by sequestering intracellular zn, which is required for its dna binding activity. peroxiredoxins are considered redox regulators of signal transduction  <cit> , acting like a switch to control intracellular pathways. perhaps the increase in intracellular zn causes an alteration in cell signaling  <cit> , and prdx <dig> upregulation occurs as a result. in addition, the suppressive effect of prdx <dig> on nf-κb may be one of the many mechanisms of how pharmacological zn, as zno enhances health in the newly weaned pig. for example, studies in caco- <dig> cells exposed to enterotoxigenic e. coli demonstrate that zn as zno protects these cells by inhibiting bacterial adhesion and internalization into cells, thus modulating subsequent cytokine expression that might occur in response to pathogenic exposure  <cit> .

glyoxalase  <dig>  is a cytosolic ubiquitous zn metalloenzyme that catalyzes the glutathione dependent conversion of glycating agents such as methylglyoxal to s-d-lactoylglutathione via a  <dig> -hydrogen transfer  <cit> . this enzyme works in conjunction with glyoxalase ii to further convert s-d-lactoylglutathione to d-lactate  <cit> . methylglyoxal can react with arginine and lysine residues in proteins, and at high concentrations it inhibits glycolytic enzymes  <cit> , enhances lipid peroxidation, and binds dna and rna causing macromolecular damage  <cit> . genomic analysis of the glo <dig> gene revealed the presence of functional metal response elements  located  <dig> bp downstream of the transcription initiation site  <cit> . another gene containing mres in its promoter region is the mt gene  <cit> . the mres control transcriptional activation of mt upon exposure to zn, through the action of metal transcription factor- <dig>  <cit> . transcriptional activity of glo <dig> in transfected hepg <dig> cells was elevated twofold upon exposure to  <dig> and  <dig> μm zncl2for  <dig> hr  <cit> . we have previously shown that mt mrna abundance and protein concentration are increased in liver, kidney and intestinal mucosa of pigs fed pharmacological zn  <cit> . this observation was confirmed for liver mt mrna abundance with the microarray analysis in the present study and similar expression patterns were observed for prdx <dig> and glo <dig> 

zinc involvement in oxidative stress is well known. its deficiency causes oxidative dna damage by impairment of antioxidant defense, and compromises dna repair mechanisms  <cit> . however, the mechanism of how supplemental zn exerts its antioxidant action is not well defined. our current microarray analysis indicated that mrna abundances of many oxidative stress molecules are affected by pharmacological zn supplementation including gstm <dig>  glutathione peroxidase , nadph oxidase , heme oxygenase  <dig> , cytochrome c oxidase viib , cytochrome p <dig> , and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma- <dig>  . from these, gstm <dig> was selected for confirmation. gstm <dig> encodes the fourth member of the glutathione s-transferase that belongs to the mu class. the mu class of enzymes function in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative stress, by conjugation with glutathione  <cit> . our results are in agreement with previous studies where dietary zn affected the hepatic gene expression of gst, gpx and cyp  <cit> . in addition to these genes, it has been suggested that mt induction by zn in hepatocytes creates an intracellular pool of thiols and zn ions, thus it can act similarly to glutathione which can then react with the reactive species  <cit> . moreover, the ability of zn to occupy iron and copper binding sites on lipids, proteins and dna, may also contribute towards its antioxidant action  <cit> . the present study shows that pharmacological zn supplementation is associated with increased mrna abundance of prdx <dig> and glo <dig>  and a tendency to increase gstm <dig> when combined with dietary phytase. interestingly these genes participate in the oxidative stress response through differing mechanisms. perhaps the increased intracellular concentrations of zn exert an increase in zn dependent enzymes creating an effective hepatoprotective role. our results for hepatic glo <dig> expression are in agreement with observations in glo <dig> transfected hepg <dig> cells  <cit> . it is possible that zn transcriptionally regulates glo <dig> through mre activation, in a similar fashion to the mt gene, therefore offering protection against glycating agents. however, to our knowledge, we provide the first evidence that dietary pharmacological zn increases prdx <dig> and glo <dig> mrna abundances. additional studies will be undertaken to further clarify the influence of pharmacological zn on gstm <dig> and related oxidative stress protein activity in pigs.

molecular chaperones or stress proteins like heat shock proteins  <dig>  and  <dig> , maintain the correct conformational homeostasis of proteins, helping newly synthesized proteins to be folded and transported across membranes and protecting them against a number of stresses thus playing the role of chaperones  <cit> . the expression of heat shock proteins is under complex control, but with final common pathways involving the heat shock factors , the function of which is zinc-dependent  <cit> . several heat shock proteins have been identified including hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  and are named according to their molecular weight  <cit> . in our present study we were able to confirm that pharmacological zn decreases hsp <dig>  mrna abundance in the liver. interestingly, in vitro studies  <cit>  which examined the relationship between protein misfolding, aggregation and chaperone induction showed that oxidative stress increased expression of hsp <dig>  however, mild oxidative stress did not induce protein denaturation and stress response. this work also showed that adding zn induced chaperone expression and higher zn concentrations counteracted the heat shock and oxidative stress mediated induction of chaperones by inhibiting their expression  <cit> . these studies support our findings that at higher zn concentrations, there is lower abundance of hsp <dig>  mrna.

three additional genes were selected for confirmation. acy <dig> encodes for a zn metalloenzyme involved in peptide metabolism, orm <dig> encodes for an acute phase reactant protein and cpb <dig> encodes for a plasma carboxypeptidase. acy <dig>  is a cytosolic enzyme with highest abundance in pig kidney versus the liver  <cit> . the biological role of acy <dig> is to hydrolyze neutral and hydrophobic α-n-acyl-l-amino acids generated during protein degradation  <cit> . this zn dependent enzyme has been identified in mammals primarily in kidney and liver  <cit> , it contains a single zn atom per subunit, and it is proposed to have catalytic roles  <cit> . however, heese et al.  <cit>  suggested that zn plays a structural role, because the zn binding site was too far from the catalytic site of the enzyme. results of northern blot analysis in this study confirm that pharmacological zn supplementation increases the relative abundance of acy <dig> mrna. no differences were observed in the abundance of this transcript between animals fed zn <dig> and zn <dig>  suggesting that at dietary concentrations greater than  <dig>  mg zn/kg, relative acy <dig> abundance reaches a plateau. to our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of zn effects on the abundance of acy <dig> mrna, suggesting a role in protein and amino acid metabolism.

orosomucoid  <dig> and cpb <dig> are genes that encode an acute phase reactant protein known as α-1-acid glycoprotein, and plasma pro-carboxypeptidase , respectively. these plasma proteins are secreted into the blood after being synthesized in the liver  <cit> . serum concentrations of orm <dig> are high in fetal  <cit>  and neonatal pigs, decreasing markedly to a constant level by  <dig> wk of age  <cit>  and declining further by  <dig> d. in a similar pattern, liver orm <dig> mrna is relatively abundant in late fetal and neonatal pigs then declines rapidly after birth  <cit> . alpha-1-acid glycoprotein plasma concentration rises during inflammation, thus its function is related to modulation of an inflammatory response primarily caused by interleukin  <dig>  interleukin  <dig> and glucocorticoids  <cit> . sequence analysis of the murine orm <dig> gene revealed the presence of four mre sequences in the 5' flanking region, and one in intron  <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, relative liver orm <dig> mrna abundance in mice injected i.p. with the heavy metal mercury  was increased in a time dependent manner. zinc was also used to investigate orm <dig> mrna response upon heavy metal exposure, but its effect on orm <dig> mrna was not as marked as hg  <cit> . the authors concluded that heavy metals regulate orm <dig> at the transcriptional level. interestingly, we found this gene to be affected by dietary treatment in both experiments using different anchor and arbitrary primer combinations, although the pattern of transcript abundance differed. we did not confirm a significant effect of dietary zn on liver orm <dig> mrna abundance for pigs in either experiment using relative real time rt-pcr.

plasma cpb <dig>  is a carboxypeptidase that appears in plasma after clotting of blood  <cit> . several names have been used for this enzyme according to its general catalytic mechanism, including carboxypeptidase u , carboxypeptidase r , plasma carboxypeptidase b  and most recently thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor   <cit> . eaton et al.  <cit>  showed that cpb <dig> becomes inactive upon addition of a zn chelating agent,  <dig> -phenantroline. the presence of cpb <dig> has been demonstrated in the pig, rabbit and mouse, with activity ranging from 20%  to 500%  compared to human serum cpb <dig>  <cit> . the physiological function of cpb <dig> is to inhibit fibrinolysis by removing c-terminal lysine residues from fibrin and limiting plasmin formation  <cit> . fibrinogen is also secreted during an inflammatory response, suggesting that overexpression of cpb <dig> could be part of a mechanism to decrease inflammation.

our display gels indicated that pharmacological zn increases the mrna abundance of orm <dig>  and cpb <dig> in pig liver. however, relative real time pcr results did not confirm their differential expression. the inability to confirm the differential display observations may be due to the low number of pigs examined along with relatively high variability in transcript abundance between pigs or the increased sensitivity of the real time rt-pcr assays.

CONCLUSIONS
the est data obtained and submitted to the genbank database as well as the transcriptional profiling from the microarray study provide sequence and differential gene expression information for hepatic genes in the pig. in addition, this study provides important information that contributes to understanding the benefits of feeding pharmacological zn diets to pigs. new mechanisms affected by dietary zn were evaluated and can be further considered in future studies, including the role of zn in reducing oxidative stress and protein metabolism, both processes that are essential for cell detoxification and function.
