BACKGROUND
the melatonin receptor family belongs to the super family of g protein coupled receptor  and contains  <dig> known subtypes, mel1a, mel1b and mel1c  <cit> . the genes for these receptors contain two exons separated by a large intron  <cit> . the mel1a gene is found on chromosome  <dig> in the chicken and human, mel1c is also found on chromosome  <dig> in chicken , while mel1b is encoded on chromosome  <dig> in the chicken and on chromosome  <dig> in the human. these  <dig> receptors all bind melatonin with a high affinity   <cit> . among them only mel1a and mel1b have been cloned and characterized in mammals  <cit>  and have been renamed mt <dig> and mt <dig> by the international union of pharmacology . in contrast, mel1c has been found only in fish, the chicken and xenopus  <cit> . the three receptors  share about 60% sequence identity and bret studies showed that mt <dig> and mt <dig> receptors could form heterodimers  <cit> .

in eutherian mammals, a previously known orphan receptor gpr <dig> was identified as a melatonin-related receptor because it has 45% identity with the melatonin receptor family  <cit> . however gpr <dig> is encoded by a gene located on the x chromosome and does not bind melatonin  <cit> . a recent study demonstrated that gpr <dig> can heterodimerize with mt <dig> and mt <dig> receptors  <cit> , leading to a suppression of mt <dig> but not mt <dig>  affinity for melatonin. interestingly gpr <dig> has only been found in eutherian mammals and not in fish or birds.

the aim of this study was to understand the phylogenetic evolution of the melatonin receptor family and more specifically of the mel1c and gpr <dig> genes using an in silico approach. studying the phylogenetic tree of the melatonin receptor family and tracking the synteny of genes surrounding mel1c in several species strongly suggested that the mel1c gene found in fish and avian species is the ortholog of the eutherian gpr <dig> gene. this interpretation was further supported by estimation of selection pressure and by a gene structure analysis of the mel1c and gpr <dig> genes.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of the melatonin receptors
the phylogenetic tree in fig. 1a–e, built from the ncbi protein database using chicken mel1c protein as the query, showed that there are four groups of orthologous genes corresponding to gpr <dig>  mt <dig>  mt <dig> and mel1c. the gpr <dig> gene was only detected in mammalian genomes . in contrast, the mel1c gene was only detected in fish species, xenopus and chicken genomes confirming previous results  <cit>  . noticeably, prototherian and metatherian species appeared in mel1c  or gpr <dig>  branches . note that several bootstrap values are low suggesting that the robustness of the tree is questionable.

branch lengths are correlated with the evolutionary rate of the sequence  <cit>  and branch length values were clearly higher for the gpr <dig> orthology group than for the other three groups. these results suggest that sequences from the gpr <dig> group evolved faster than those from mt <dig>  mt <dig> or mel1c groups.

analyses of selection pressure were performed to provide insights into functional constraints applied at sequence level to the gpr <dig> group. the branch-site model a was applied to test evolutionary shift using the maximum likelihood method. the branch leading to the gpr <dig> group was labelled as the foreground branch and all others as background branches in the phylogenetic tree. parameter estimates under model a suggested that 71% of sites evolved under purifying selection  whereas 29% sites were identified under the neutrality assumption. likelihood ratio tests  were highly significant with p <  <dig>   when the model a was compared to the null model m1a . thus, the model did not find evidence for positive selection and that, on average, numerous sites  evolved without functional constraint.

in order to test if positive selection occurred in different lineages along the phylogeny, others branches  were labelled as foreground branches. the calculations are summarized in table  <dig>  all the lrts gave significant results. compared to the gpr <dig> group, the percentage of sites evolving under purifying selection was higher, particularly for the mel1c group . remarkably, the percentage of sites evolving under neutrality for gpr <dig> was ~28%, contrary to the mel1a, b, and c groups whose percentages were ~3%. positive selection was detected in the mel1a, b, c groups. the bayes empirical bayes  analysis identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sites respectively, under positive selection along branches leading to mel1a, b, c, at a probability of >95%. amino acids under positive selection are reported in table  <dig>

note: p is the number of free parameters for the ω ratios. parameters indicating positive selection are written in bold. tests comparing sites-specific model m1a and branch-site model a are significant at 1%, df =  <dig>  sites potentially under positive selection were identified using gpr <dig> from o. aries according to the bayes empirical bayes analyses for model a . these sites are shown in fig.  <dig> 

analysis of mel1c synteny
in order to test whether mel1c and gpr  <dig> genes were lost in mammals and in non-mammals species respectively, we carried out a study of the synteny of these genes. at the mel1c gene locus on chicken chromosome  <dig> the following group of genes encoding bhlhpas, mel1c, hmg2a, cd <dig> molecule like  <dig> and myotubularin related protein were displayed . for clarity, accession numbers of these genes and their orthologs in different species are summarized in table  <dig>  interestingly, synteny has been best conserved in mammals where the chromosomal locus containing me11c is found on the x chromosome  . except for minor changes among species  this synteny analysis clearly shows that, despite rapid evolution of the coding region of interest, mel1c evolved into gpr <dig> in eutherian mammals. a blast analysis against all the available mammalian genomes did not reveal any "fossilized" pseudogenes of mel1c at this locus in any species, strengthening the notion that the mel1c ancestral gene was not duplicated in mammals to allow the emergence of gpr <dig> and of a lost mel1c pseudogene. interestingly, this rapid evolution was also observed in neighbouring genes, i.e. 2610030h <dig> rik  and hmg2a  whose phylogenetic trees show either poor bootstrap values  or an odd organization . this synteny approach represented therefore a powerful tool to elucidate the orthology relationships between fast evolving genes.

sequence alignments between paralogs of the melatonin receptor family, and sequence identity analysis
the percentage of identically aligned amino acids between mt <dig>  mt <dig>  and mel1c/gpr <dig> from five species , gallus gallus , monodelphis domestica , mus musculus , homo sapiens ) are presented in table  <dig>  the greatest sequence identity among the orthologous genes was observed for mt <dig> where more than 75% of the amino acid alignment has been conserved if we exclude xenopus laevis.

mutagenesis studies performed either on the human  <cit>  or ovine mt <dig> receptor  <cit>  and studies using human chimeric gpr50/mt <dig> receptor constructs  <cit>  have shown several highly conserved residues in transmembrane helices that are critical for ligand binding especially those in transmembrane helix iii  . in addition, mutation of the n <dig> within the specific nry signature of the melatonin receptor group, located just downstream of tmiii dramatically impairs receptor function . in the same way, key amino-acid residues in the ligand binding pocket of the mt <dig> receptor are located in transmembrane helices iv , v , vi  and vii  . these residues are extremely conserved among species and receptor subtypes. it is worth noting that some key amino acids for melatonin binding that are found in helix vi of the mt <dig> receptor  and of the mt <dig>  are substituted by t <dig> and v <dig> respectively in human gpr <dig> 

structural evolution of mel1c into gpr50
sequence alignments of the orthologous genes mel1c and gpr <dig>  reveal the addition of a long c terminal domain in the gpr <dig> receptor. as a consequence, the largest discrepancies between the sequence alignment of amino acids was observed for the mel1c and gpr <dig> orthologs where the sequence identity ranged from 45% to 79% . this led us to compare the gene structure of the me11c and gpr <dig> receptors.

study of mel1c structures in several species using blat software revealed a common gene organization in the zebra fish and the chicken where mel1c was coded by  <dig> exons . the structure of the gpr <dig> gene was very similar in mouse and man where it also contained  <dig> exons, but the first exon is segmented into  <dig> smaller exons in the horse. in contrast, the gpr <dig> gene in the opossum was made up of  <dig> smaller exons. the c-terminal fragment in 3' position in eutherian mammals replaces the stop codon found in the chicken and zebra fish; the fragment starts at the 3' end with a sxl amino acid sequence, s being amino acid  <dig> in the mouse,  <dig> in man and  <dig> in the horse . analysis of this extension to the c-terminus of the receptor using a bidimensionnal hydrophobic cluster analysis  identified a repeated sequence between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> . this repeated sequence is organized around a degenerated heptapeptide. the first and last positions of the heptad are generally occupied by an aromatic amino acid, the sixth position by an aliphatic, hydrophobic amino acid, and the second and fifth positions are occupied by a basic amino acid  and by a hydroxyl amino acid . one of the ten repeats has a single amino acid insertion  between the fifth and sixth positions. this repeat heptad is reminiscent of the c-terminal repeat domain  of rna polymerase ii , with which it well aligned . the rnapii ctd also has an unusual extension, outside the catalytic core of the largest subunit of the enzyme, that serves as a flexible binding scaffold for numerous factors that regulate transcription-related events . the binding of factors to the rnapii ctd is determined by the pattern of phosphorylation, which principally occurs at ser <dig> and ser <dig> of the repeat. worth noting, is that the second and fifth positions in gpr <dig> repeats include amino acids that are highly conserved. a serine is also highly conserved in the fifth position, as for rnapii ctd, whereas a basic amino acid  is invariably conserved in the second position instead of a serine. this conserved pattern in gpr <dig> together with its similarity to rnapii ctd, suggests that gpr <dig> repeats might also constitute a flexible scaffold for the binding of partner that recognize specific phosphorylation sites. the gpr <dig> heptad repeat is followed by a ~ <dig> amino acid domain. and from hca analysis the domain is predicted to be structured. however, this domain is unusually rich in serine and threonine residues and many other repeated sequences . these sequences are probably in specific structures and functions.

discussion
using an in silico approach, we have demonstrated in this study, that mel1c, the gene for a high affinity melatonin binding receptor found in the chicken and in xenopus, rapidly evolved into gpr <dig> gene in eutherian mammals. the gpr <dig> gene encodes a receptor that does not bind melatonin but affects the interaction of this hormone with its cognate mt <dig> receptor after dimerization.

analysis of the phylogenetic tree of the melatonin receptor family suggested that mel1c is not present in mammals. two evolutionary hypotheses are possible. the first, is duplication of the mel1c/gpr <dig> ancestral gene before the emergence of vertebrate species. one of these genes evolved into the mel1c gene of fish species, xenopus and the chicken, the gpr <dig> gene being lost in these species, while in mammals, the ancestral gene evolved into gpr <dig> and the mel1c gene was lost. this hypothesis implies the existence of a mel1c pseudogene in mammals and a gpr <dig> pseudogene in fishes, xenopus and chicken. a similar pathway exists for the zona pellucida gene family  <cit>  where the zpax and zpd genes have been lost in mammals. however, careful analysis of blast data against all the genomes studied failed to find any evidence for "fossilized" genes for gpr <dig> or mel1c for example, a residual exon with a stop codon or a deletion. thus it is unlikely that mel1c/gpr <dig> evolved as a consequence of gene duplication. the second more likely hypothesis is that the mel1c gene evolved rapidly into gpr <dig> gene in mammals by the mutation of several critical amino acids and by the addition of a c-terminal sequence. a condition for this hypothesis to be true is that the mel1c and gpr <dig> genes are surrounded by the same genes, in the syntenic genomic regions of the chicken, opossum and mammalian genomes. this conserved synteny has been clearly highlighted in our results. in this regard, the mel1c/gpr <dig> gene is located close to a break in the synteny of the chromosome. breaks of synteny zones are associated with regions of chromosomal instability in rodents  <cit> . navarro and barton  have also demonstrated that the ka/ks ratio is higher for genes located on chromosomes that underwent structural rearrangements between the human and the chimpanzee compared with colinear chromosomes  <cit> . it is therefore possible that a link exists between the rapid evolution of mel1c into gpr <dig> gene in mammals and its close vicinity to a site of structural rearrangement in the chromosome.

considering the rapid evolutionary process of mel1c into gpr <dig>  two interesting features are worth highlighting. the first is the loss of affinity of gpr <dig> for melatonin. it is widely assumed that g protein-coupled receptors and among them, the melatonin receptors, share the same structure as rhodopsin in which predicted critical residues for ligand binding to the appropriate binding pocket are located in the transmembrane regions  <cit> . mutagenesis studies performed either on human mt <dig> or mt <dig> receptors have shown that several transmembrane amino-acid are critical for the binding of melatonin. among these, the critical amino acids for melatonin binding g <dig> in helix vi of mt <dig> and g <dig> and l <dig> of mt <dig> are replaced by t <dig> and v <dig> in human gpr <dig>  interestingly, these amino acid substitutions have probably evolved under conditions of neutrality strengthening the neutral evolution theory of kimura  <cit> , even if at present, there no available tools to confirm this theory. our results show that five other separate sites  also underwent rapid evolution under positive selection. one of these amino acids , in the second extracellular loop of the gpr <dig>  has replaced s or t in all melatonin receptor subtypes of all species except in esox lucius mt <dig> . whether or not these amino acid substitutions have actually led to the loss of affinity of the gpr <dig> for melatonin may be confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. to explain the loss of affinity of gpr <dig> for melatonin, we observed that the amino substituted under positive selection were surprisingly not the ones identified as being important for high affinity binding. the 3d structural model reveals that both types of sites , although distinct, are close to each other leading to potential impairment of ligand binding. the gpr <dig>  3d model also shows that three of the sites under positive selection are located at the external membrane surface of the receptor. at this position they might be able to "gate" the receptor ligand pocket and therefore contribute to loss of affinity of gpr <dig> for melatonin.

the second intriguing feature of mel1c/gpr <dig> evolution is the addition of the long c-terminal tail. this region may have also contributed to the functional differences between gpr <dig> and mel1c. this ctd shows no signs of rapid evolution because it is well conserved among mammals. it is of note that the opossum gpr <dig> gene contained four more exons coding for the ctd of this receptor than eutherian mammals. however, psi-blast did not reveal any significant homology of the last  <dig> exons with a known protein suggesting that this ctd appeared after the divergence of non-eutherian and eutherian mammals. the physiological function of this ctd remains to be established.

despite the functional difference between gpr <dig> and mel1c no positive selection was detected suggesting that functional shifts not always correlated with positive selection or that the model used for detecting positive selection is unable to discriminate sufficiently. however, the percentage of sites in the gpr <dig> group  that on average, evolve under neutrality allows us to hypothesize that relaxed selection is linked to functional change. this percentage for the branch leading to the mel1a, b, c groups is ~3% suggesting that the melatonin receptor family has a divergent evolutionary history. currently, only a few examples of relaxed or positive selection have been related to functional shifts but the role of the environment in gene evolution must be statistically examined before any such claims can be substantiated  <cit> . key insights into understanding the role of the environment on the evolution of gpr <dig> would be gained by pinpointing the selective advantage conferred in mammals by the change. determining the physiological roles of this receptor is therefore critical to the testing of this hypothesis.

the rapid evolution of mel1c into gpr <dig> is associated with a change in the physiological role of the the pineal gland, from a directly photosensitive organ with its own photoreceptors in most non-mammalian vertebrates into an indirectly photosensitive neuroendocrine gland in mammals  <cit> . moreover, there is a difference between fishes and mammals in the cellular pathways inducing genes in the pineal gland. one is the recently described orphan nuclear receptor rev-erb α  <cit> . this gene is regulated by orthodenticle homeobox  <dig>  through a pineal expression related element  that is found in fish species and xenopus but not in mammals  <cit> . nishio and co-workers suggest that rev-erb α gene expression in the pineal underwent a major functional shift in mammals. interestingly, it was previously reported that otx <dig> family of genes undergoes rapid evolution in mammalian lineages where they are known as crx genes, with a restricted distribution compared to otx genes  <cit> . taken together with our data, these results suggest that some components of the photoresponsive network, from the genes expressed in the pineal gland to melatonin receptors in the hypothalamus, underwent particularly rapid evolution in vertebrates. however the precise significance of this evolution still needs to be clarified.

the functional significance mel1c and its evolution into into gpr <dig> are unclear partly because of the lack of knowledge concerning the role of mel1c receptors in the intracellular transduction of the melatonin signal. moreover, the physiological regulation  <cit>  and function  <cit>  of gpr <dig> receptors remain largely unknown despite a recent paper indicating an altered metabolic phenotype of gpr <dig> knockout mice  <cit> . interestingly, mel1c and gpr <dig> receptors do not share the same distributions in the brain. in the chicken, mel1c is widely spread in the brain  <cit> , while in mammals gpr <dig> has been observed in hypothalamo-pituitary regions, for example dorsomedial hypothalamus in the rodent  <cit>  and the pars tuberalis in the human and the sheep  <cit> , a noticeable exception is the ependymal cell layer of the third ventricle where strong gpr <dig> expression is seen in all species examined to date  <cit> . this altered pattern of expression and the loss of affinity for melatonin is probably not a neutral physiological event with respect to melatonin signalling. melatonin is secreted throughout the period of darkness and the duration of its secretion mimics daylength during the year  <cit> . this signal constitutes a chemical transduction of the time of the year and is a critical factor for the regulation of seasonal functions such as moulting, hibernation and reproduction in mammals . it is intriguing that gpr <dig> is present mainly in the ependymal cell layer of the third ventricle  <cit> , where cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of melatonin are up to  <dig> times higher than in blood  <cit> . in addition, levels of gpr <dig> in ependymal cells of siberian hamsters are lower under photoperiodic conditions that mimic short days  <cit> . a recently published in vitro study reported decreased function of the mt <dig> receptor after heterodimerization with gpr <dig> because of an interaction of the c-terminal tail of gpr <dig> with regulatory proteins of mt <dig> receptors  <cit> . it is thus tempting to speculate that the photoperiodic modulation of gpr <dig> regulates the function of the mt <dig> receptor by altering its affinity for melatonin, and hence modulates physiological responses elicited by this receptor. a critical test of such a hypothesis is to determine if mt <dig> receptors are in the ependymal cell layer of the third ventricle. presently this is difficult because there is not a suitable mt <dig> receptor antibody and because of low levels of mt <dig> mrna  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this work has shown that the methodology allowing the building of phylogenetic trees may not be sufficient to define the orthological relationships among genes that evolve rapidly, and that studying synteny is often necessary to decipher the relationships among genes of a family. when applied to the family of melatonin receptor genes, this approach allowed us to demonstrate that the high affinity melatonin receptor mel1c found in non mammalian species is present in the genomes of mammalian species where it has been named gpr <dig>  this receptor has been extensively remodelled through evolution by the mutation of numerous critical amino acids and by the addition of a long c-terminal tail. these alterations have modified the affinity of gpr <dig> for melatonin and probably affected its interactions with the two functional melatonin receptors, mt <dig> and mt <dig>  in mammals. further studies are required to determine the physiological roles of the gpr <dig> receptor.
