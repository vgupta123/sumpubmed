BACKGROUND
nuclear hormone receptors and transcription factors can regulate the transcription of their target genes by inducing chromatin changes. paradigmatic are the retinoic acid receptor alpha  and the transcription factor core binding factor , which regulate in this way the transcription of target genes involved in hematopoietic processes  <cit> . differently from rarα, which epigenetically activates its targets by recruiting coactivator protein complexes with histone acetyl transferase  activity only when bound to retinoic acid, cbf can directly recruit hat-containing complexes to activate its targets  <cit> . one of the two cbf subunits, cbfα or aml <dig>  can bind target genes endowed with the aml1-consensus sequence tgggt via its n-terminal dna-binding domain  <cit> . aml <dig>  encoding a master hematopoietic transcription factor, is frequently affected by different chromosome translocations in leukemic cells  <cit> . moreover, aml <dig> haploinsufficiency was found to be associated with familial platelet disorder, a condition predisposing to acute myeloid leukemia  <cit> .

two leukemia-associated chromosome translocations, the t and the t, result in the fusion between the n-terminal region of aml <dig> and the c-terminal regions of two almost identical chromatin corepressors, mtg <dig> and mtg <dig>  leading to the formation of aml1-mtg <dig> and aml1-mtg <dig>  respectively  <cit> . upon fusion with either mtg <dig> or mtg <dig>  aml <dig> is converted from a transcriptional activator into a transcriptional repressor of aml1-targets. specific mtg domains in the wild type, as well as in the mtg fusion proteins, can interact, directly or via other corepressors such as ncor and sin3a, with histone deacetylases , thus creating a repressive chromatin state at aml <dig> target sites . repression at these sites is further enhanced by the formation of oligomers between the fusion proteins and wild-type mtg proteins  <cit> .

myeloid cell differentiation systems, such as the 32d mouse myeloid cell line, ectopically expressing either aml1-mtg <dig> or aml1-mtg <dig>  were used as models to simulate some of the effects of these fusion proteins in myelogenesis and leukemogenesis. both fusion proteins, when exogenously expressed in the 32d background, were shown to affect granulocytic differentiation and produce distinct effects on cell proliferation  <cit> . in a preliminary study, we found that aml1-mtg <dig>  when exogenously expressed in 32d cells, can induce aberrant myeloid phenotypes in association with repressive modifications at the chromatin of the colony stimulating factor  <dig> receptor , an aml1-target gene encoding the macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor  <cit> . based on this finding, we hypothesize that the comparative epigenetic analysis of the changes induced by different aml1-mtg fusion proteins in an identical cell context  might provide a lead to elucidating the differences observed in leukemic cells carrying either one of the two proteins  <cit> . the objective of this study was to demonstrate whether aml1-mtg <dig> induces epigenetic changes at aml1-target genes in the 32d myeloid cell genome. only by coupling global gene expression array analysis with a bioinformatic genomic survey for the aml1-consensus sequence, we were able to close onto aml1-targets downregulated by aml1-mtg <dig>  aml1-mtg16-induced transcriptional downregulation was marked by the acquisition of a distinct repressive chromatin signature.

RESULTS
global gene expression array analysis of aml1-mtg16-expressing cells
to study the molecular and biological consequences of aml1-mtg <dig> expression in a myeloid differentiation cell model, we previously developed, by infecting 32d mouse myeloblasts with retroviral particles carrying either the plncx <dig> vector containing the aml1-mtg <dig> cdna or the cognate empty vector, stable independent clones expressing aml1-mtg <dig>  and stable independent control clones , respectively . upon treatment with granulocyte colony stimulating factor , a <dig> clones do not undergo granulocytic differentiation and proliferate significantly less than mock clones . global gene expression analysis  of a prototypic a <dig> clone and a prototypic mock clone grown either with interleukin  <dig>  or g-csf for  <dig> h, was combined with bioinformatic analysis of the proteins encoded by all the differentially expressed genes with the ingenuity software . this analysis clearly revealed a network comprising proteins critical for platelet function in a <dig> cells . the identification of this protein network strongly supports the biological data, indicating the occurrence of functional aml <dig> haploinsufficiency in a <dig> cells  <cit> .

further analysis of the gene expression data  enabled us to identify  <dig> differentially expressed genes, of which  <dig> differentially expressed genes in cells grown with il- <dig>   <dig> differentially expressed genes in cells grown with g-csf, and  <dig> differentially expressed genes in both cells grown with il- <dig> and g-csf . according to the ingenuity software, the differentially expressed genes in a <dig> cells were mostly implicated in tumorigenesis, cell proliferation, and hematopoiesis . since from this analysis alone we were unable to conclude whether, or not, these genes were aml1-mtg <dig> direct targets, we devised a bioinformatic approach aimed at identifying the aml1-consensus sequence in the  <dig> kb region around the transcription start site of these genes.

identification of genes containing the aml1-consensus sequence by bioinformatic analysis
since the aml1-mtg proteins have a transcriptionally repressive function , we focused our bioinformatic analysis on the  <dig> genes downregulated by aml1-mtg <dig> . specifically, we searched the  <dig> kb around the transcription start site of each gene for either the aml1-binding consensus sequence tgggt or, this sequence in reverse orientation, accca. with the meme software  we identified a conserved motif, hereafter called aml1-consensus motif , encompassing the aml1-consensus sequence in seventeen out of the  <dig> genes . we focused on five of these genes, fcer1a, tcfec, ptprcap, f2rl <dig>  and mgmt , because they were among the most significantly downregulated genes. fcer1a, tcfec, ptprcap, f2rl <dig>  and mgmt encode for known proteins. specifically, fcer1a is the fc fragment of ige and is involved in the immune response  <cit> ; tcfec is a transcription factor that induces, among other genes, the g-csf receptor gene  <cit> ; ptprcap is a transmembrane protein associated with cd <dig>  a key regulator of lymphocytes activation  <cit> ; f2rl <dig> is a member of g protein-coupled protease-activated receptors  of the coagulation factor ii  and plays an important role in platelet activation  <cit> ; mgmt is a dna repair enzyme that is frequently lost in cancer due to epigenetic silencing  <cit> . downregulation of these genes was confirmed by real time rt-pcr .

fcer1a, tcfec, ptprcap, f2rl <dig>  and mgmt are direct aml1-mtg <dig> targets
quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation  with an anti-aml <dig> specific antibody, but not with an anti-mtg <dig> antibody , showed significant  enrichment of the region encompassing the aml1-consensus motif  relative to an arbitrary control region without the aml1-consensus motif in the mock clone chromatin for all five genes, indicating endogenous aml <dig> binding at these regions . chip with an anti-mtg <dig> antibody showed instead a significant enrichment of exogenous aml1-mtg <dig> in the same chromatin regions in the a <dig> clones . the human homologues of these genes also contain an aml1-consensus sequence in the 10kb region surrounding the transcription start site, pointing to these five genes as novel, bona fide direct aml1-targets genes.

repressive chromatin changes at aml1-mtg16-downregulated targets
we previously demonstrated that aml1-mtg <dig> interacts with both hdac <dig> and hdac <dig>  <cit> . further, we found that aml1-mtg <dig> can induce downregulation marked by repressive histone hypoacetylation at the csf1r chromatin  <cit> . here we show that, in a <dig> cells, the chromatin associated with both the region containing the aml1-consensus motif and the region encompassing the transcription start site of fcer1a, tcfec, ptprcap, f2rl <dig>  and mgmt  displays a significant  decrease of acetylated histone h <dig> , and a significant  increase of h3k <dig> tri-methylation  , supporting the acquisition of a repressive chromatin state  <cit> .

repressive histone modifications are often associated with aberrant hypermethylation at cpg islands present in the 5' regulatory regions of many genes  <cit>  and references within). by using the cpg island searcher  <cit> , a software for the identifying cpg islands, we could identify a cpg island only in the mgmt promoter region  <cit>  . bisulfite sequencing analysis of this region detected hypermethylation in aml1-mtg16-positive cells .

the overall epigenetic analysis indicates that downregulation of aml1-targets by aml1-mtg <dig> can be achieved, even in the absence of dna methylation, when there is a critical quantitative level of repressive histone changes.

discussion
in this study we show the effectiveness of integrating global gene expression array analysis with a bioinformatic approach aimed at detecting aml1-consensus sequences for identifying novel putative direct aml1-targets downregulated by aml1-mtg <dig> in 32d cells. downregulation of these genes is marked by a distinct repressive chromatin profile.

when we surveyed the  <dig> most significantly downregulated genes for the presence of the aml1-consensus motif in the  <dig> kb region encompassing the transcription start site, we closed on seventeen putative direct aml1-mtg <dig> targets. for five of these genes, fcer1a, tcfec, ptprcap, f2rl <dig> and mgmt, which were among the most significantly downregulated, we were able to demonstrate, using chip analysis, the binding of both aml <dig> and aml1-mtg <dig> to the gene regions containing the aml1-motifs. thus, our two-tier approach, combining gene expression array analysis with bioinformatic survey for transcription factor-consensus sequences, seems to be a powerful strategy for identifying transcription factor targets, which would otherwise be missed when using conventional gene expression array analysis alone.

the chromatin of the five downregulated genes, fcer1a, tcfec, ptprcap, f2rl <dig>  and mgmt, was marked not only by significant levels of histone h <dig> hypoacetylation, but also by significant levels of repressive histone h3-k <dig> trimethylation, suggesting that aml1-mtg <dig> might induce the recruitment of both histone deacetylases  <cit>  and histone methyltransferases. apparently, a critical quantity of repressive histone modifications, even in the absence of cpg methylation, might per se be sufficient to "lock in" a transcriptionally downregulated state. in the case of mgmt, which has a cpg island, it is instead possible that the accumulation of histone repressive changes preceded cpg hypermethylation .

it is noteworthy that all the genes for which we demonstrated aml1-mtg16-induced epigenetic downregulation encode for functions relevant to either hematopoiesis and/or leukemogenesis. we would like to underline that downregulation of two of the genes that we identified might be relevant to aml1-mtg16-induced leukemogenesis. one of these genes is tcfec, whose human counterpart encodes a transcription factor that induces the granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor g-csfr  <cit> . remarkably, tcfec downregulation in a <dig> cells is paralleled by a significant downregulation of g-csfr , indicating that aml1-mtg <dig> might have triggered a coordinated cascade of transcriptional downregulation, as we observed in other differentiation model systems  <cit> . the second gene is mgmt, encoding the dna repair enzyme o6-methylguanine-dna-methyltransferase, which is frequently silenced and hypermethylated in leukemia  <cit> . mgmt epigenetic silencing is thought to lead to random mutations in cancer  <cit> . a recent study has shown that expression of different acute myeloid leukemia fusion proteins, including aml1-mtg <dig>  leads to downregulation of several dna repair genes  <cit> . thus, the induction of a "mutator phenotype" might be a common consequence of leukemia fusion protein expression.

a few global gene expression studies on cells expressing exogenous aml1-mtg <dig> have been recently described  <cit> . given the use of different cell systems, it is difficult to compare the differentially expressed genes in aml1-mtg16-positive 32d cells with the differentially expressed genes reported for aml1-mtg <dig>  nevertheless, we could identify a few gene families  that are similarly affected by both aml1-mtg <dig> and aml1-mtg <dig> even in different cell contexts. extending our study to the comparison of the epigenetic signatures imposed by either exogenous aml1-mtg <dig> or exogenous aml1-mtg <dig> in the very same cell context  might enable us to narrow down additional critical epigenetic signatures consequent to t and t translocations.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we show that aml1-mtg <dig>  the leukemia fusion protein associated with the non-random chromosome translocation t, can impose transcriptional downregulation marked by a distinct epigenetic signature at specific aml1-target sites in the genome. thus, our findings further support the hypothesis that non-random genetic abnormalities can lead to non-random epigenetic changes in leukemia cells  <cit> .
