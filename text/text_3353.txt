BACKGROUND
the intestinal microbial community provides a variety of crucial functions for their vertebrate hosts e.g.  <cit> , though the factors that influence the colonization of this habitat are less understood. common patterns among microbial communities of different hosts have promoted the concept of a core set of species, which provides a minimal functionality in the healthy gut and which is determined by host-specific selection  <cit> . for example, host transcriptional responses to microbial colonization appear to be conserved among a wide range of vertebrates, including fish  <cit> . moreover, within the intestinal community of humans, some species are more prevalent  <cit>  and functional gene profiles are highly similar among individuals  <cit> . nevertheless, the utility of the core microbiota concept at a fine taxonomic level has recently been questioned due to limited evidence of universally abundant species in humans  <cit> .

fish provide unique opportunities to investigate the factors that influence the composition of the vertebrate intestinal microbiota due to their high species diversity  <cit> , dietary variation or habitat preferences  <cit> , and divergent immune architecture. for instance, considering the differences in immune systems as an example, atlantic cod lacks the antigen presenting major histocompatibility complex  ii system, which was thought to be conserved among all jawed vertebrates  <cit> . this lack of mhc ii may affect the interactions of atlantic cod with its microbial community  <cit> . a extensive meta-analysis -based on uncultured and cultured sampling methods- indicates that the composition of the intestinal communities in teleosts is influenced by both abiotic and biotic factors  <cit> . nevertheless, this meta-analysis is predominantly based on pooled sanger sequencing data, and studies investigating microbial communities in fish using high-throughput sequencing are relatively rare. moreover, the studies that employed these methods so far have focused on fresh water species held in semi-controlled environments  <cit> . one exception investigating natural populations of zebrafish, identified a core intestinal microbiota based on shared operational taxonomic units , despite substantial differences in host provenance and domestication status  <cit> . this study pooled  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> individuals respectively, before sequencing  <cit> . therefore, to our knowledge, a characterization of the microbial community using high-through methodologies in wild-caught, individual fish is still lacking. here we investigate the intestinal microbial communities of  <dig> wild-caught atlantic cod collected at a single location and quantify a core microbiota based on shared membership in a  <dig> sequenced 16s rrna v <dig> region amplicon dataset.

RESULTS
we obtained  <dig> sequences of approximately  <dig> basepair  of the 16s rrna v <dig> region and identified  <dig> otus at 97% sequence similarity. rarefaction curve analysis, depicting the relationship between the number of detected otus and read number, shows that the final number of otus per sample  is not caused by uneven sequencing depth . this variation among samples also appears in estimates of community diversity , which vary an order of magnitude . analogous to the intestinal community composition in zebrafish  <cit>  or human e.g.  <cit> , the samples are typically dominated by a few abundant otus, while the majority of otus is present at rare frequency . at 97% sequence similarity,  <dig> otus are shared that are highly abundant based on the number of reads . the number of reads assigned to these otus varies substantially among individuals, and no more than five otus are shared using a detection cut-off value of at least five reads . moreover, for sequence similarity values above 80% the number of shared otus is fairly constant, indicating that this number is not a result of restrictive cut-off values when clustering . overall, the shared otus represent a fraction of the overall sequence diversity for a wide range of cut-off values .

normalized mean values  and standard deviations  for the number of otus, shannon index and inverse simpsons index. normalized values were obtained by random resampling according to the smallest sample size  and standard errors were obtained by bootstrapping . otus are clustered according to a 97% sequence similarity cut-off value.

at order level classification, the intestinal community of atlantic cod is dominated by vibrionales followed by variable numbers of bacteroidales, erysipelotrichales and clostridiales . the high proportion vibrionales  agrees with those proportions found in a meta-analysis based on genbank sequences of other marine carnivores  <cit>  and bacteria from this order have also previously been isolated from the atlantic cod gut e.g.  <cit> . nevertheless, the intestinal community also contains a substantial proportion of bacteriodales . such abundance has previously been proposed to be a characteristic of the microbial community of marine herbivores, and this finding suggests that the distinction between herbivorous and carnivorous fish may be more subtle  <cit> . members of the most abundant orders agree with those reported previously in atlantic cod using both culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques  <cit> . in addition, using high throughput sequencing, several more orders are detected that are relatively rare. shared otus belong to the orders vibrionales, bacteroidales, erysipelotrichales, clostridiales, alteromonadales and deferribacterales . overall, taxonomical diversity  does not necessarily correlate to the number of reads per order.

to our knowledge, our dataset provides the first characterization using high throughput sequencing of individual intestinal microbial community structure in a natural population of marine fish. it is possible that our sampling retrieved fish from different populations. nevertheless, tagging studies in the norwegian skagerrak coastal region have shown that adult atlantic cod have confined home ranges  <cit>  and genetic studies have revealed fine scale geographical population structure  <cit> . considering our single sample location, far from the fjord exit, and comparable size of individuals , we assume that our individuals were retrieved from a local population experiencing similar environmental conditions.

among our samples, we find  <dig> shared otus, with profound variation in the number of reads per individual. this number of shared otus may be an overestimation as the fish were kept in a single tank after capture and thus experienced the same environmental conditions before sampling. we presume such a similar environment is more likely to homogenize microbial communities, rather than promote individual differences. nevertheless, this shared number of otus appears relatively low compared to the number of shared otus  among populations of zebrafish from radically different environmental conditions, coming either from natural populations in india or from artificial environments in two separate laboratories in the usa  <cit> . for now, this difference in shared otus between our study and the study focusing on zebrafish is difficult to interpret due to methodological variation e.g. pooled versus individual samples, v1-v <dig> versus v <dig> 16s rrna region,  <cit> . it will be interesting to investigate if these differences in shared otus membership are environmentally determined  or are species specific .

community diversity estimates based on  <dig> amplicon data are influenced by methodological factors such as fragment length, pcr bias and choice of 16s rrna gene region. specifically, shorter amplicon lengths  may result in relatively higher diversity estimates compared to longer fragments  <cit>  and arguably provide a better assessment of community structure  <cit> . in contrast, species richness estimate based on analyses of the 16 s rrna v <dig> region appears to slightly underestimate diversity relative to the full-length gene  <cit> . such methodological issues make it difficult to compare community diversity across different studies  <cit> , although metrics that use both richness and relative abundance  appear robust  <cit> , in particular considering our extensive sequencing depth  <cit> . interestingly, these metrics fluctuate several orders of magnitude among our different specimens, and show large individual variation in community composition and diversity. the most diverse individuals appear to have a comparable community complexity relative to those found in humans  <cit> .

a variety of properties, such as shared otu membership, shared phylogeny, persistence or connectivity can be used to define microbial cores  <cit> . here we investigated a core microbiota based on shared membership. definitions for such a core have been proposed ranging from a lineage present in more than half the population  <cit>  to an abundant lineage shared among all individuals  <cit> . we argue that the utility of such concept depends on the specificity with which it describes a biological phenomenon and favor the idea that a lineage should be reliably identified among all individuals in order to belong to a core microbiota, hence with a detection probability of at least 99%. according to such definition, the presence of a core microbiota at 97% sequence similarity consists of five otus in this population of atlantic cod. these otus belong to orders vibrionales, bacteroidales, erysipelotrichales, clostridiales and alteromonadales.

it is possible that the observation of a shared otu membership can be explained by other factors other than host-specific selection. for example, between teleost fish, the colonization and community structure of the microbial gut community appears better explained by environmental factors such as food choice or habitat  than by host phylogeny  <cit> . considering our single sample location, it is currently unclear if the observed core microbiota in atlantic cod is explained by host-specific selection or driven by shared environmental factors. interestingly, human microbial gut communities are functionally remarkably similar, despite extensive variation in taxonomic composition  <cit> . this functional redundancy may provide support for a ‘founder takes all’ process of colonization, in which a successful colonizer can prevent the subsequent colonization by other, functionally similar strains through high density blocking  <cit> . such a stochastic process could lead to the high variation in community composition that we observe among our different specimens.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the extensive  <dig> sequencing of a 16s rrna v <dig> region amplicon library, we find that the otu based community diversity estimates of the intestinal microbial community in wild-caught atlantic cod vary significantly among individuals collected at a single location. this individual level variation suggests that a complex combination of factors influences the microbial species distribution in these intestinal communities. importantly, such variation has gone unobserved in previous studies of natural populations of teleosts whereby samples of pooled individuals were analyzed  <cit> , which may affect estimates of the number of shared otus among hosts.
