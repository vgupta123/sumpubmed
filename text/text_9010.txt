BACKGROUND
apomixis describes a suite of reproductive processes in flowering plants that result in asexual seed formation, and subsequently give rise to progeny which are clones of the maternal parent  <cit> . contrary to the sexual pathway, wherein the diversity of progeny is derived from meiotic recombination during gamete formation followed by parental gamete fusion and embryogenesis at fertilization, apomixis avoids meiosis during female gamete development, and embryogenesis initiates without fertilization. use of apomixis in plant breeding could economize and speed delivery of new plant varieties by preserving unlinked complex traits, such as heterosis in hybrid crops, within a single seed generation. as apomixis is not evident in major seed crops, isolation of genes from apomictic model species with the intention to transfer them to crops has been a major focus of research.

most apomictic species are polyploids, often with large genomes, and evidence suggests apomixis is generally conferred by dominant loci in most examined species  <cit> . apomictic loci are often found to be associated with highly repetitive chromosomal regions where recombination is suppressed, and additional loci also appear to influence the penetrance of the apomixis phenotype  <cit> . to date, genes within apomictic loci which are capable of conferring apomixis phenotypes are largely unknown, with the exception of a recently identified gene from apomictic pennisetum that stimulates fertilization-independent embryogenesis  <cit> .

identification of genes regulating apomixis has been hindered due to limited genomic and transcriptomic resources available in apomict model species. several transcriptomic analyses in apomictic species have been published to date, including serial analysis of gene expression , microarray approaches , and more recently de novo sequencing  <cit> . however, the generation of genomic resources within these species has generally been neglected, and an integrated resource combining genomic and transcriptomic data in any one apomictic species has not yet been realized. furthermore, genome assembly and annotation has been difficult due to the high complexity of polyploid genomes in apomicts, and de novo transcriptomic assemblies are likely to underrepresent the diversity of transcripts actually present due to the collapsing of homologous genes with high sequence similarity into chimeric contigs  <cit> .


hieracium subgenus pilosella species within the asteraceae contain both obligate sexual and facultative apomictic species where apomixis is not fully penetrant  <cit> . within apomictic species the trait is dominant, and apomixis occurs via aposporous embryo sac formation . apomictic hieracium species are also amongst the few known apomicts capable of both fertilization-independent embryo and endosperm development during seed formation . recombination at apomixis loci within the pilosella subgenus of hieracium does occur at low rates when crossed with sexual species, which in combination with a collection of apomixis deletion mutants, available bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries and expressed sequence markers, has aided in the generation of a genetic linkage map . coupled with a short lifecycle and an established transformation capability, these species have been developed into a valuable molecular and genetic model for the analysis of apomixis. currently, the closest phylogenetic relative to hieracium with a comprehensively sequenced and annotated genome is the tomato , within the solanaceae, which reproduces exclusively through typical sexual seed formation pathways  <cit> . a substantial expressed sequence tag  database from a closer relative within the asteraceae, lettuce , also an obligate sexual, is publicly available together with a high-density genetic map  <cit> ; however, functional annotation within the lettuce est resource is limited. the availability of a hieracium genomic resource coupled with temporally staged ovary transcriptomes, where the events of apomixis take place, could significantly accelerate the isolation of apomixis genes and loci.

within aposporous species of hieracium, specification of the megaspore mother cell , meiosis and selection of the functional megaspore  occur as found during typical polygonum-type female gamete development in sexual plant species   <cit> . however, following the initiation of meiosis, one or more cells from sporophytic tissue, termed aposporous initial  cells, enlarge near the cells undergoing the events of meiosis and megaspore selection in the majority of ovules . one of the ai cells initiates a mitotic gametophyte program which results in the formation of an aposporous gametophyte and concurrently leads to degeneration of the developing sexual female gametophyte . inhibiting meiosis within the mmc prevents ai cell initiation, suggesting that ovule cues associated with activation and progression of meiosis may stimulate ai cell development  <cit> . transcriptomic analysis of microdissected ai cells suggests that enlarging ai cells do not express key meiosis genes  <cit> . the egg and central cell in the aposporous embryo sac then undergo fertilization-independent embryo and endosperm development  <cit> .fig.  <dig> sexual and aposporous gametophyte development in hieracium. hieracium ovaries contain a single ovule. specification of the megaspore mother cell  occurs at the mmc stage in ovules of both sexual  and aposporous  species. at the functional megaspore  stage, meiosis has occurred and aposporous ovules contain aposporous initial  cells in addition to a meiotic tetrad where the fm is expanding. within sexual ovules, the fm undergoes mitosis, generating a meiotically reduced gametophyte. within aposporous ovules, the ai cell initiates a mitotic program to generate an unreduced aposporous gametophyte, and the adjacent sexual tetrad with enlarging fm degrades. within aposporous ovules, the aposporous embryo sac will initiate fertilization-independent embryo and endosperm development to generate a clonal seed, whereas sexual ovules require fertilization . for additional details of sexual and apomictic development, refer to the text




a collection of gamma irradiated deletion mutants within the aposporous hieracium species h. praealtum  identified two independent and dominant loci, loss of apomeiosis  and loss of parthenogenesis , which are required for ai cell initiation and fertilization-independent seed development, respectively  <cit> . deletion mutants lacking loa fail to initiate ai cell development, and therefore sexual gametophytic development progresses to completion. sexual gametophytes that inherit a functional lop locus, in the absence of loa, can still initiate fertilization-independent seed formation resulting in plants with reduced ploidy relative to the parent. deletion mutants lacking lop generate unreduced gametophytes mitotically through ai cells. however, they are not capable of undergoing fertilization-independent embryo or endosperm development and therefore require fertilization by a male gamete to initiate seed development, resulting in plants with increased ploidy. deletion of both loci results in a complete reversion to sexual reproduction, indicating that sexual reproduction is the default state in the apomict, and the apomixis phenotype in r <dig> is superimposed upon and suppresses normal sexual development  <cit> . the model for apomixis regulation in subgenus pilosella currently posits that the initiation of meiosis during sexual megaspore development activates loa, enabling specification of an apomictic lineage with ai cell formation. the ai cell recruits genes normally involved in the mitotic events of sexual female gametogenesis, and as it undergoes aposporous embryo sac formation the adjacent sexual gametophyte is actively suppressed. lop later functions together with other identified seed initiation loci to either de-repress or activate genes involved in embryo and endosperm formation within the aposporous embryo sac, overcoming the requirement for fertilization  <cit> .

a cytological analysis with loa-specific probes indicates loa is localized within a hemizygous, repeat-rich chromosomal region, and molecular markers linked to loa and lop have been shown to be conserved in additional hieracium species, including h. piloselloides  and h. caespitosum  <cit> . while much has been learned regarding the genomic region surrounding both loa and lop, very little is known about the specific loci themselves, or any putative genes contained within them.

interestingly, recent studies in sexual plants indicate that species-specific disruptions in small rna biogenesis and function can cause apomixis-like initiation of female gametogenic development. in arabidopsis, mutations affecting argonaute <dig>  cause formation of additional gametic precursor cells in the ovule, which is reminiscent of the apospory phenotype  <cit> . in zea mays mutations that affect zmago4d/ago <dig>  the sexual mmc avoids meiosis and forms unreduced embryo sacs reminiscent of apomictic development in diplosporous species  <cit> . both ago genes are involved in the maintenance of non-cg dna methylation through the rna-dependent dna methylation  pathway  <cit> . additional genes involved in the biogenesis of small rnas have also been shown to induce the formation of extra cells with gametogenic potential in arabidopsis mutants. mutations in rna-dependent rna polymerase <dig>  and dicer-like <dig> , genes required for the production of 24-nt small interfering rnas  as part of the rddm pathway, as well as rdr <dig> and suppressor of gene silencing <dig> , which are required for the production of 21-nt sirnas and trans-acting sirnas , all induce formation of extra gametic precursor cells  <cit> . small rnas may also be involved in sexual gametophyte development, as evidenced by a semi-dominant mutant affecting ago <dig> in arabidopsis, which fails to initiate megagametogenesis following selection of the post-meiotic fm  <cit> . while these data indicate that a number of genes involved in small rna biogenesis or function are required for specification and development of female gametogenesis within these normally sexual species, whether small rnas might also be involved in the regulation of apomictic pathways within naturally apomictic species is currently unknown.

in this paper, we introduce a genomic survey sequence of d <dig>  a dihaploid apomictic plant derived from a rare meiotically reduced egg that underwent parthenogenesis within the tetraploid apomict h. piloselloides . d <dig> has been demonstrated to contain the loa-associated chromosome and markers  <cit> . we used the d <dig> genomic resource to investigate apomixis initiation through the analysis of transcriptomes and small rna profiles in ovaries isolated from sexual and apomictic plants, and provide an initial characterization of small rna pathway genes within hieracium. comparisons of ovary transcriptomes from apomictic r <dig> and two r <dig> deletion mutants unable to initiate apomixis  identified differentially expressed genes in common between the two mutants to be enriched for gene ontology  terms associated with small rna biogenesis and chromatin silencing via the rddm pathway. however, for genes associated with these go terms, the direction of their fold change was not conserved between the two mutants. comparisons of small rna length distributions between r <dig> and the m <dig> or m <dig> deletion mutant did not reveal any large-scale alterations, although an alignment of small rnas to d <dig> genomic contigs identified a small number of putative differentially targeted genes within the two mutants. these data provide an extensive integrated platform to aid in the identification of apomixis-related genes and the investigation of the role of small rnas during asexual gametophyte development.

RESULTS
generation of an apomictic hieracium genomic and transcriptomic resource
in order to maximize genome sequence coverage in apomictic hieracium, we generated a de novo assembly from genomic dna isolated from the dihaploid apomict d <dig>  which consists of two reduced subgenomes as compared to the predominantly tetraploid hieracium plants we have previously characterized . the predicted genome size of d <dig> is  <dig>  gb   <cit> , and the resulting de novo d <dig> genomic assembly consisted of  <dig>  gb of unordered contigs . a filtered set of  <dig>  million contigs ≥ <dig> kb was used in subsequent analyses, totalling  <dig>  gb in length, with an n <dig> of  <dig>  kb. markers that have been previously shown to be linked to loa were identified within the resulting contigs; however, a single contig spanning all linked markers was not assembled, likely due to the repeat-rich context typically found at the loa locus  <cit> .table  <dig> summary of genotypes and phenotypes of hieracium plants used in the analysis and nucleic acids examined

to complement the genomic assembly, whole ovary transcriptomes were generated from the apomicts d <dig> and h. praealtum , a sexual species h. pilosella  and two loa deletion mutants derived from gamma-ray mutagenesis of r <dig> . while both m <dig> and m <dig> are aposporous mutants that have lost the ability to form ai cells and only form sexual female gametophytes, m <dig> is a complete sexual revertant because it has also lost lop, whereas m <dig> retains lop function  <cit> . although m <dig> has lost the apospory phenotype, it retains the repeat-rich region surrounding loa, and metaphase chromosome spreads indicate that m <dig> has  <dig> chromosomes in contrast to the  <dig> chromosomes evident in the progenitor r <dig> . chromosome numbers in the set of hieracium deletion mutants range from 34– <dig>  as in addition to inducing deletions and chromosomal rearrangements, ionizing radiation is known to result in gain or loss of chromosomes  <cit> .

given our focus on gene expression during apomixis initiation, we analysed transcriptomes and small rnas isolated from whole ovaries of sexual and apomictic plants at two developmental stages characterized by distinct sexual events. the earlier megaspore mother cell  stage consisted of ovaries wherein the ovules contained mmcs undergoing meiosis . the later stage, designated the functional megaspore  stage, consisted of ovaries wherein the ovules contained a specified functional megaspore . within mmc stage ovules of apomicts, ai cell initiation is not yet visible, whereas within the fm stage, enlarged ai cells are evident in the majority of ovules . the independent de novo transcriptomic assemblies for each stage and genotype generated ranged in size from  <dig> to  <dig> thousand contigs, and the n <dig> of contig lengths varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb .

an abinitio gene model prediction analysis of the assembled genomic d <dig> contigs yielded  <dig>  predicted gene models that were further annotated for both nucleotide and predicted coding sequence  correspondence to known gene sequence sets from arabidopsis , tomato , lettuce ests  and several other plant species . the assembled genomic d <dig> contigs and predicted gene models were assessed for sequence diversity to provide an estimate of gene copy number and heterozygosity. based on blast alignments,  <dig>  % of predicted d <dig> gene models have a copy number of  <dig> or less, and 53 % of d <dig> genomic sequences were within  <dig> single-nucleotide polymorphisms  per  <dig> bases of each other. we also assessed the genomic and transcriptomic assemblies for coverage of known tomato cdnas and lettuce ests to provide an estimate of the gene coverage present in the resource. the average coverage of tomato cdnas from all assemblies was observed to be  <dig>  %, and the average coverage of lettuce ests and lettuce unigenes was  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively, reflecting the closer phylogenetic history of hieracium and lettuce . the average number of d <dig> cdss that could be mapped to each lettuce est was  <dig> , and to each unigene was  <dig> . by comparison, on average  <dig>  lettuce ests could be mapped to each lettuce unigene. the proportion of assembled hieracium transcript contigs aligning to the d <dig> assembly averaged 74 % for the transcriptomes derived from the r <dig> backgrounds, and 83 % for the d <dig> transcriptomic assemblies . the genomic and transcriptomic data have been integrated into a publically available genome browser, along with a sequence blast server, accessible as described in the ‘availability of data and materials’ section.

expression of sexual pathways in sexual and apomictic hieracium ovaries during early developmental stages
sexual gametogenesis initiates and proceeds to the functional megaspore stage within all ovules of the sexual and apomictic plants examined in our transcriptomes. we first attempted to gain an indication of the variation in sexual pathway gene expression between genotypes and across the two developmental stages, in addition to exploring the sensitivity of sexual transcript detection in whole ovaries . to do this we accessed reproductive functional gene categories in arabidopsis, an obligate sexual species, using virtualplant  <cit> . these included genes involved in male and female gametophyte development, meiosis, cell fate specification and multiple associated reproductive processes . this subset of  <dig> arabidopsis cdnas was associated with d <dig> predicted gene models using blastp, and transcriptome reads from r <dig>  d <dig>  p <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> ovary samples at mmc and fm stages were aligned to the d <dig> gene models. of the initial  <dig> gene models,  <dig> could be associated with transcriptome reads. in general, most genes displayed stable expression across the samples studied .

these analyses detected the expression of genes typically found in low levels in specific arabidopsis ovule cell types. one example is an ortholog of wuschel , a homeobox gene shown to have highly cell-specific expression during specification of stem cell niches, as well as the initiation of integument development in ovules and specification of the mmc . this supports the sensitivity of reproductive transcript detection represented by relatively few cell types in the whole ovary samples.

a principal component analysis  of the  <dig> hieracium gene models and their expression across all samples highlighted greater separation between the three species represented by p <dig>  d <dig> and r <dig>  and less distinction between apomicts r <dig> and d <dig>  within each genotype, little separation was observed between the two developmental stages. the apomict r <dig> and the deletion mutants derived from it could be identified as a cluster, with m <dig> showing more variation from the others on the basis of this reproductive gene set than found between r <dig> and m <dig> .fig.  <dig> principal component analysis of sexual pathway genes in hieracium ovaries. principal component analysis of  <dig> sexual pathway genes in apomictic r <dig> and d <dig>  sexual p <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  apomict mutants derived from r <dig>  at both the mmc  and fm  stages. samples are largely separated by genotype, with developmental stage contributing less to variation. sex sexual phenotype, apo apomictic phenotype. percentage variation for each principal component is shown at each axis




we then further examined the gene list for stage- or genotype-specific patterns using hierarchical clustering of a subset of  <dig> genes displaying variation exceeding  <dig> standard deviation of the mean. this revealed multiple patterns, including differential expression between stages that were shared across all genotypes, and also strong genotype-specific changes irrespective of stage . notably, however, neither the pca nor the hierarchical cluster analyses of this reproductive gene set identified any discriminatory expression signatures between the sexual and apomictic phenotypes. however, the pca does suggest that comparisons between the two apomictic species, r <dig> and d <dig>  and in particular comparisons between genotypes within the r <dig> background, m <dig> and m <dig>  were likely to be the most informative with respect to common and differential gene expression changes during these developmental stages.

identification of additional loa-linked markers
previous analyses of loa- and lop-linked markers indicated that genomic deletions at the loa and lop loci in m <dig> were extensive, whereas in m <dig>  all loa- and lop-linked markers were found to be present  <cit> . this suggested that either the loa-associated deletion within m <dig> was smaller than that in m <dig>  or alternatively, the loss of apospory phenotype in m <dig> could be due to an loa-independent lesion potentially acting downstream of loa. to identify potential genes and markers linked to deletions in common between m <dig> and m <dig>  the ovary transcriptomes of r <dig> and the two deletion mutants were used to identify snps lost within both mutants. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> transcriptome contigs from the mmc and fm stages, respectively, were identified as missing snps from both m <dig> and m <dig> mutant transcriptomes. a subset of  <dig> snps was then selected for validation and examination of linkage to loa through the design of sequence characterized amplified region  markers and amplification from a collection of loa and lop deletion mutants, as well as a previously described hieracium mapping population  <cit> . the validation process confirmed that  <dig> of these markers are missing from all loa deletion mutants tested, including m <dig>  and that these genes are linked to loa . all but one of the  <dig> markers were also missing within the sexual p <dig> species, and in all but one recombinant all  <dig> markers were missing . these are the most closely linked markers to loa identified to date, and demonstrate the utility of the transcriptomic resources for mapping purposes. importantly, this work also demonstrates that m <dig> contains a deletion genetically linked to the loa locus, confirming its utility for use in examining transcriptional changes related to loa function.fig.  <dig> linkage group  <dig>  from r <dig> containing the loa locus and linked markers. the linkage group, updated here, is part of a linkage map previously constructed in r <dig>  <cit> . the loa trait is shown in magenta type and underlined. loa-linked markers within both the m <dig> and m <dig> deletions are in cyan type. loa-linked markers within the m <dig> deletion are shown in orange and green type which represent their location upon previously defined loa-linked contigs a and b, respectively  <cit> . centimorgan distances are indicated at left





identification of small rna pathway genes within hieracium ovaries
previous studies have shown that mutations affecting small rna pathways in maize and arabidopsis can exhibit defects in specification of sexual cell lineages or induce formation of extra cells with gametogenic potential  <cit> .we therefore interrogated the d <dig> genomic resource for predicted genes encoding members of the rdr, dcl and ago protein families. putative candidate genes were identified using blastp, and predicted hieracium proteins were assigned names based on sequence similarity to annotated proteins from tomato  <cit> . we identified  <dig> predicted genes encoding partial or full-length rdr-related proteins,  <dig> encoding predicted dcl proteins and  <dig> encoding predicted ago proteins .

in addition to d <dig> genomic sequences, we compared expressed ago sequences isolated from apomictic r <dig> and sexual p <dig> ovaries to investigate whether structural differences or gene family composition in ovary-expressed ago proteins might contribute to their reproductive phenotypes. we identified  <dig> transcriptome contigs encoding ago-related proteins with high similarity to tomato ago proteins and confirmed the expression of the putative ago genes by sequencing their predicted full-length coding regions from r <dig> and p <dig> whole ovary cdna . in most cases, the ago reverse transcription-pcr  products were heterogeneous and exhibited snps present in the transcriptome contigs as well as snps unique to the amplified products, suggesting that both the clones and assembled transcriptome contigs likely represent multiple gene copies of high sequence similarity . a phylogenetic analysis of consensus sequences from all amplified agos placed the  <dig> hieracium ago proteins into three major clades with representative members of each typical plant ago protein family , suggesting small rna pathways observed in other plant species are also likely to be functional within hieracium ovaries. direct orthologs of atago <dig> or atago <dig> were not identified within hieracium or tomato in this analysis, despite playing an important role in restricting mmc specification within arabidopsis  <cit> . furthermore, atago2a, atago <dig>  hpago2a, hpago2b, slago2a, slago2b and slago <dig> appear to be paralogous within each respective species, suggesting that they arose from duplication following speciation.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of cloned argonaute proteins from hieracium. consensus sequences from cloned r <dig> hieracium ago proteins  were aligned to ago proteins from solanum lycopersicum  and arabidopsis thaliana . a cladogram was generated based on  <dig> alignments. bootstrap values are indicated on branches. hieracium agos fell into three primary clades alongside orthologs in tomato and arabidopsis





sequence comparisons of orthologous agos between sexual p <dig> and apomictic r <dig> plants showed high levels of sequence conservation with most orthologs sharing greater than 90 % pairwise sequence identity at the amino acid level . within the paz domain of the apomictic r <dig> hpago4c we identified a nine-amino-acid residue deletion  that was not detected in clones from sexual p <dig>  the deletion in r <dig> removes several conserved residues including a highly conserved proline . the arabidopsis ago1- <dig> mutant is affected at the same residue  and has a strong phenotype most likely due to improper folding of the paz domain  <cit> . it is therefore likely that the r <dig> hpago4c protein is similarly severely affected in function. modelling of the r <dig> hpago4c protein against the human argonaute <dig> protein suggests that the deletion could cause a shift in the a <dig> α-helix   <cit> , although it is unclear whether such a deletion would allow proper folding of the paz domain. we also identified a three-amino-acid residue indel within the piwi domain of hpago <dig> between r <dig> and p <dig>  the indel is in an evolutionarily highly variable region and is unlikely to affect the overall structure. markers generated against the hpago4c and hpago <dig> indels indicated they were not missing in either m <dig> or m <dig>  therefore, these indels appear to be species-specific differences between r <dig> and p <dig>  and are unlikely to be associated with the loa locus .fig.  <dig> protein modelling of hpago4c. a a structural super-position of the human argonaute <dig> protein  with hpago4cp <dig>  and hpago4cr <dig> . b a portion of the structural super-position of the human argonaute <dig> protein  with hpago4cp <dig>  showing the location of the hpago4cr <dig> deletion . the hpago4cp <dig> overlaps well with the human argonaute <dig> protein. c a portion of the structural super-position of the hpago4cp <dig>  and hpago4cr <dig>  showing the location of the deletion in hpago4cr <dig> . the nine-amino-acid residue deletion in hpago4cr <dig> is predicted to shorten the secondary loop structure, which causes a substantial tilt of a neighbouring α-helix




we further examined all cloned ago sequences for differential gene expression within ovaries using quantitative real-time pcr . we restricted this analysis to r <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> genotypes, as differences in gene expression can vary between species. we detected decreased expression of hpago1a within m <dig> ovaries relative to r <dig> ovaries at both stages , whereas hpago2b was downregulated in both m <dig> and m <dig> ovaries relative to r <dig> at both stages . hpago <dig> also appears to be slightly downregulated in both m <dig> and m <dig> ovaries relative to r35; however, only the r35:m <dig> comparisons met statistical significance . further examination of snps within the ovary transcriptome suggested that three polymorphic snps from hpago1a were missing in the m <dig> ovary transcriptome, suggesting that the reduced expression of hpago1a observed in m <dig> ovaries might be due to the loss of one or more copies of hpago1a within this mutant. we confirmed the loss of these hpago1a polymorphic snps by amplifying them from genomic dna and sequencing the resultant products. all three amplicons showed loss of the informative snps within m <dig> and several other loa deletion mutants, but not m <dig>  suggesting they are not associated with the apospory phenotype .table  <dig> relative expression of hpago genes in r <dig> ovaries relative to m <dig> and m <dig> ovaries as determined by qrt-pcr

as the qrt-pcr analysis suggested that hpago1a, hpago2b and hpago <dig> were differentially expressed between r <dig> and the two derived deletion mutants, we further examined the expression of these genes in ovaries using in situ hybridization. in general, antisense probes against all three ago genes showed broad expression patterns throughout the ovary and flower at both the mmc and fm stages . signals throughout the entire ovary were more intense at the fm stages compared to the mmc stages for all three ago probes examined; however, there were no obvious spatial differences in signals between r <dig> samples and m <dig> or m <dig> . although we could not reliably detect major differences in signal intensity between r <dig>  m <dig> or m <dig> samples, this is most likely due to the relatively minor differential expression observed being below the level of detection using this method.fig.  <dig> in situ hybridization of hpago1a, hpago2b and hpago <dig> in hieracium. a and d hybridization of hpago1a antisense probe  to mmc  and fm  stage ovary sections from r <dig>  b and e hybridization of hpago2b antisense probe  to mmc  and fm  stage ovary sections from r <dig>  c and f hybridization of hpago <dig> antisense probe  to mmc  and fm  stage ovary sections from r <dig>  mmc megaspore mother cell, ai aposporous initial cell. scale bars = 100 μm




differential gene expression within aposporous ovaries during ai cell development
we next examined the ovary transcriptomic resource for differential gene expression between mmc and fm stages to identify genes associated with ai cell growth and development. reads from apomictic r <dig> and d <dig> ovaries were aligned to d <dig> genomic contigs and predicted gene models. within r <dig>   <dig> gene models displayed differences between the mmc and fm stages, and  <dig>  of these were also differential between mmc and fm stages in the d <dig> apomict  . this analysis identified a putative ortholog of the lipoxygenase lox <dig>  as increasing in transcript abundance from the mmc to fm stage in r <dig>  which corresponds with its increased expression during ai cell development as previously verified by in situ hybridization  <cit> . the  <dig> gene models commonly differential between both stages in r <dig> and d <dig> were mapped to go molecular function and biological process terms through putative arabidopsis orthologs. enrichment of functional themes in differential lists was identified relative to a background of the full set of gene models found expressed in the r <dig> ovary at these stages. this analysis identified enrichments at the mmc stage for terms associated with dna binding and transcription factors, as well as other pathways including polysaccharide biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism . the fm stage lacked enrichment of transcription factor terms but was characterized by terms associated with proteolysis, cation transportand also arabinan and xylan catabolism . these results demonstrate our ability to detect ai-associated transcripts within our whole ovary transcriptomes and provide evidence of transcriptional changes during the initiation of ai cell development.

m <dig> and m <dig> ovaries share many co-differentially expressed genes with contrasting directional fold changes
we further examined our transcriptome data to identify differentially expressed genes between ovaries from aposporous plants and those that lack the apospory phenotype. as our pca demonstrated that genotype contributed the greatest amount of variation between samples , we focussed our analysis on r <dig> and the two deletion mutants derived from it. within the r35:m <dig> comparisons,  <dig> and  <dig> predicted genes were identified as being differentially expressed at the mmc and fm stages, respectively . within the r35:m <dig> comparisons,  <dig> and  <dig> predicted genes were identified as being differentially expressed at the mmc and fm stages, respectively . we further examined  <dig> predicted differentially expressed genes using qrt-pcr. we were able to confirm significant differential expression in  <dig> of the  <dig> genes tested within cdna isolated from whole ovaries . the low validation rate may relate to complexities associated with cross-species comparisons between d <dig> predicted gene models and r <dig> transcripts, and/or the presence within the tetraploid plants of highly similar orthologs or homeologs with dissimilar expression profiles.table  <dig> relative expression of putative differentially expressed predicted gene models in r <dig> ovaries relative to m <dig> and m <dig> ovaries as determined by qrt-pcr

we then examined whether there were any overlaps within the differentially expressed predicted genes between the r35:m <dig> and r35:m <dig> comparisons. we identified  <dig> and  <dig> predicted gene models with differential gene expression in both mutants at the mmc and fm stages, respectively . we found that the ai cell-associated hplox <dig> gene was downregulated in both m <dig> and m <dig> mutants, which is consistent with the sexual phenotype of these plants. of the differentially expressed genes in common between m <dig> and m <dig>   <dig> at the mmc stage and  <dig> at the fm stage showed decreased expression in both mutants relative to r <dig> . however, at both the mmc and fm stages, the largest overlaps of differentially expressed predicted genes between the r35:m <dig> and r35:m <dig> comparisons were associated with opposing expression patterns, having increased expression in m <dig> ovaries and decreased expression in m <dig> ovaries relative to r <dig> .fig.  <dig> overlapping differentially expressed genes between r <dig> and mutant apomict comparisons at two developmental stages. a a four-way venn diagram showing numbers of overlapping differentially expressed genes between the r35:m <dig> and r35:m <dig> comparisons at the mmc stage. b a four-way venn diagram showing numbers of overlapping differentially expressed genes between the r35:m <dig> and r35:m <dig> comparisons at the fm stage




we further examined differentially expressed genes in common between both r35:m <dig> and r35:m <dig> comparisons for functional themes within enriched go terms. due to the low annotation rate within differentially expressed genes showing similar directionality between the r35:m <dig> and r35:m <dig> comparisons , we instead focussed on enriched go terms within all differentially expressed genes in common, irrespective of directionality. differentially expressed genes at both stages were enriched for terms involved in chromatin silencing and small rna production, including maintenance of dna methylation, gene silencing by rna, post-transcriptional gene silencing by rna and production of sirna involved in rna interference . genes that fell within these categories include genes annotated as putative orthologs of arabidopsis shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of small rnas, including rdr <dig>  dcl <dig>  dcl <dig> and dcl <dig>  as well as other associated genes such as decrease in dna methylation <dig> , silencing defective <dig> , subunits of rna polymerase iv  and rna polymerase v , ago <dig> and ago <dig>  interestingly, in rdr <dig> and dcl <dig> mutants, as well as the nrpd1a nrpd1b double mutant, additional mmc-like cells are specified in arabidopsis  <cit> . as with most differentially expressed genes in our transcriptome analysis, these genes showed decreased expression in m <dig> ovaries and increased expression in m <dig> ovaries relative to r <dig>  we attempted to confirm the differential expression of putative orthologs of sde <dig>  dcl <dig>  dcl <dig> and nrpd1b using qrt-pcr; however, we were unable to detect differential expression using this method . other enriched go terms in both stages included terms associated with regulation of cell cycle, chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis, stem cell fate, cell wall biosynthesis and regulation of cell growth .

apomixis initiation is dependent on localized signals
certain classes of small rnas and mrnas are involved in long distance movement from roots and vegetative tissues to influence various processes . the differential and divergent expression of genes involved in small rna pathways identified in comparisons between r <dig> and the aposporous mutants m <dig> and m <dig> prompted us to examine if long distance signalling influenced apomixis initiation. we conducted reciprocal grafting experiments combining scions and rootstocks of sexual and apomictic seedlings to test if signals from the roots of apomictic plants could induce ai cells in ovules formed in flowers of sexual scions, or if signals from sexual rootstocks could suppress ai cell formation in ovules of an apomict scion . ai-like cells were absent at flowering in ovules of control grafts combining sexual p <dig> scions and rootstocks. al cells were only found within ovules when the grafted scion was the r <dig> apomict, and suppression of apomixis was not observed when the sexual seedling was used as the rootstock . this shows that apomixis is not graft transmissible and suggests that the major signals required to induce ai cell development are likely to be localized within floral and ovary tissues and unlikely to occur via long distance signalling.table  <dig> percent of ovules showing evidence of ai cell development in grafted plants




analysis of small rna profiles within sexual and apomictic ovaries and their targets
to directly characterize the composition of small rnas expressed within hieracium ovaries, we sequenced small rnas isolated from whole ovaries at both the mmc and fm stages within the aposporous apomicts r <dig> and d <dig>  as well as deletion mutants m <dig> and m <dig>  as a comparison, small rnas were also sequenced from the leaves of each genotype. in total, the filtered dataset contained  <dig>  million sequences  . length distributions were used to assess whether the sequence diversity and abundance relationship was qualitatively similar across hieracium samples and whether global length and diversity patterns reflected those reported in other plant tissues   <cit> . length distributions of total small rna counts across all samples revealed a doubling of 22-nt small rnas in the ovary samples relative to leaf samples in all genotypes . the increase in total 22-nt small rnas in ovaries relative to leaves may represent an organ-specific signature. length distributions of small rnas within r <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> ovaries suggested a small decrease in the number of 21–22 nt small rnas and a small increase in 24-nt small rnas within both mutants . however, we did not detect any major differences in small rna compositions between r <dig>  m <dig> or m <dig> ovaries at either developmental stage.

we aligned the full set of small rna sequences to the assembled d <dig> genomic contigs. on average we were able to align  <dig>  % of small rna sequences from ovary and leaf samples to d <dig> contigs, of which  <dig>  % aligned to genic regions . genic regions were defined by the coordinates of in silico predicted gene models extended 500 bp upstream and downstream to cover potential regulatory regions. on average 62 % of small rnas from r <dig> ovaries aligned to predicted gene bodies , 19 % aligned to predicted untranslated regions  and 19 % aligned to +/−500 bp upstream/downstream regions . in comparisons of alignments between 21-nt and 24-nt small rnas, 21-nt small rnas were more likely to align to predicted cdss and 5’ utrs, whereas 24-nt small rnas aligned more frequently to predicted 3’ utrs and downstream regions . alignment distributions within predicted gene models across all samples analysed were highly similar, and we did not observe any differences between r <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> at either stage .

small rna sequences were also used to predict and annotate micrornas . using the small rna sequence directly, we could identify  <dig> distinct matches to previously reported plant mirnas present in mirbase  <cit> , and of these  <dig> could be aligned to locations in the d <dig> assembly. to predict potentially novel mirnas in the d <dig> genomic assembly, we looked for patterns of small rna alignment and a predicted secondary structure suggestive of an mirna-precursor-like hairpin. we identified  <dig> predicted mirna genes within the d <dig> assembly, of which  <dig> could be annotated using the mirbase database, suggesting the majority of putative mirna genes are likely species-specific . in total,  <dig> mirna annotatable small rna reads and  <dig> predicted mirnas were found to have differential small rna read counts in comparisons between r <dig> and m <dig> or m <dig> . the list of differentially expressed mirnas included annotations to mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir171; however, we did not observe any conserved pattern of differential expression between sexual and apomictic ovaries .

we further investigated genic regions for evidence of differential accumulation of small rnas between r <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> at both the mmc and fm stages. within the r35:m <dig> comparisons,  <dig>  and  <dig> predicted gene models showed greater than twofold differential accumulation of small rna alignments at the mmc and fm stages, respectively . within the r35:m <dig> comparisons,  <dig> and  <dig> predicted gene models exhibited differential accumulation of small rna alignments at the mmc and fm stages, respectively . the differential gene models in common between the small rna mutant comparisons were  <dig> and  <dig> at the mmc and fm stages, respectively .

we further examined whether any of the predicted genes with differential small rna counts overlapped with predicted differential expression in our transcriptome analysis. predicted gene models that had complementary fold change directions between the transcriptome and small rna alignments were examined to identify potential genes in which the changes in small rna accumulation might be affecting transcript abundance . cross-referencing genes that appeared across multiple comparisons identified  <dig> genes that had complementary differential expression in two or more lists . in examining annotated genes within these lists, we identified two gene models annotated as exordium-like  genes  <cit> , both of which had decreased transcript abundance that correlated with an increase of 24-nt small rnas in both mutants relative to r <dig> . both gene models predominantly showed an accumulation of 24-nt small rnas within the gene body, suggesting these two gene models might be targets of the rddm transcriptional gene silencing pathway . the two hpexo-like genes are highly similar in sequence, sharing 98 % identity at both the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence level. as such, the majority of differentially abundant small rnas are predicted to target both gene models at locations with identical sequence. due to high sequence similarity between these two gene models, we were unable to design oligos that could distinguish between the two hpexo-like isoforms using qrt-pcr. however, a pair of oligos which amplifies both hpexo-like isoforms did confirm a significant downregulation of transcript abundance within both mutants . we were able to amplify the hpexo-like targets from genomic dna isolated from both m <dig> and m <dig>  suggesting downregulation of these hpexo-like genes within mutant ovaries is most likely due to transcriptional repression rather than deletion. however, it is also possible that an identical hpexo-like gene has been deleted in both mutants.

discussion
integrating the hieracium genomic and transcriptomic resources to identify differentially expressed genes
previous studies within apomictic species have focussed on transcriptomic approaches. while a few candidate genes have been identified in these studies , the analysis of transcriptomes within most apomictic species is complicated by the high complexity, redundancy and polyploid nature of their genomes. the limitations of de novo transcriptomic assemblies in the absence of genomic information frequently leads to the compression of multiple gene copies into single transcriptome contigs, effectively reducing the gene space, and potential loss of informative alleles  <cit> . by taking advantage of the dihaploid d <dig> apomictic plant, we have maximized the genomic sequencing coverage of a functional apomict, which would be highly unfeasible using a typically tetraploid genotype.

using our d <dig> genomic assembly as a tool for transcriptomic analysis, we compared the transcriptomes of whole ovaries from both sexual and apomictic plants. the ovaries were isolated at two stages, mmc and fm, which respectively cover early meiotic phases and early female gametophyte development within the ovules of all genotypes examined in this study. as the transcriptomes were generated from whole ovaries, which contain both gametophytic and sporophytic tissue, in addition to a small amount of aposporous tissue in apomicts, it is important to recognize the limitations of using such starting tissue for the detection of apospory tissue-specific gene expression. nevertheless, we were able to detect differential expression of the ai-associated gene hplox <dig> , suggesting that this approach is not impractical. this strategy also provides an opportunity to capture transcript information relating to sporophytic ovule signals, as these may also contribute to gametogenic cell specification and gametophyte development. our whole ovary transcriptomic and genomic resources will prove invaluable for future research using laser-assisted microdissection approaches to analyse tissue-specific expression, by improving our ability to assemble contigs and distinguish unique transcripts, which is often a difficult task when using these approaches.

confidence in the ability to detect low abundance transcripts was supported by the analysis of all transcriptomes using a subset of orthologs associated with the sexual pathways in arabidopsis, which demonstrated detection of genes expected to be expressed at low abundance in the ovary . these analyses also demonstrated that genotype differences were a major contributor to variation in sexual gene expression, stressing the need to explore the use of closely related species, segregants and/or mutants within the same background for meaningful transcriptomic comparison . importantly, these analyses also confirmed findings from our previous work in hieracium that has found that the sexual pathway remains viable in apomictic ovary samples, supporting the concept that similar gene expression pathways are recruited in sexual and apomictic ovaries  <cit> .

while the assemblies derived cannot be considered to provide full coverage of the d <dig> genome or ovary transcriptomes, their size, internal consistency and degree of overlap within the resource and to related genomic resources is high , suggesting excellent coverage of the early reproductive developmental transcriptome within hieracium ovaries. to our knowledge, it is the first publically available genomic resource available within any apomictic species, integrating transcriptomic and small rna sequencing data from multiple genotypes. thus, this collection of sequences is established as a coherent and targeted functional genomic resource for the study of gene expression programs occurring during the early sexual and apomictic events of gametogenesis.

the extensive nature of hieracium rdr, dcl and ago gene families
small rna pathways have been implicated in the regulation of sexual pathway initiation in other species  <cit> , therefore, we initiated a search for rdr, dcl and ago genes within the d <dig> genomic assembly. this revealed a larger than expected number of predicted genes within these families, especially when considering the incomplete coverage of the chromosomally reduced d <dig> genomic assembly. however, rdr, dcl and ago family members involved in major small rna biogenesis pathways were represented within the d <dig> genomic assembly, suggesting that a complete loss of any one pathway is unlikely to explain the apospory phenotype . although we did not identify direct orthologs of arabidopsis ago <dig> or ago <dig> in hieracium, this is not unexpected, as phylogenetic analyses of agos in other plant species also demonstrate a lack of direct orthologs to these genes, suggesting that ago <dig> and ago <dig> are arabidopsis-specific . further examination of ovary-expressed ago genes by cloning of full-length cdnas from apomictic r <dig> and sexual p <dig> ovaries revealed that representatives of each ago were expressed in both species. although some differences between agos isolated from r <dig> and p <dig> do exist, they do not appear to be associated with the loa locus and are most likely species-specific differences .

qrt-pcr analysis of all cloned ovary-expressed ago genes identified hpago2b and hpago <dig> as having reduced expression in one or both mutants. hpago2b showed the strongest reduction in both m <dig> and m <dig> and was downregulated at both stages examined . hpago2b is most closely related to atago <dig> and atago <dig>  although hpago2a and hpago2b form their own clade ; therefore, it is not possible to assign a direct ortholog. atago <dig> has been shown to preferentially bind small rnas 21 nt in length, and has been implicated in multiple small rna response pathways, including post-transcriptional gene silencing in response to viral or bacterial defence as well as dna damage repair . in contrast, atago <dig> has been demonstrated to primarily bind sirnas 24 nt in length, and exhibits partial functional redundancy with atago <dig> in the rddm pathway despite being more closely related to atago <dig>  <cit> . hpago <dig> was most strongly downregulated in m <dig> at both stages, and may also be downregulated in m <dig>  although it failed to meet the statistical cut-off . in arabidopsis, atago <dig> has also been shown to preferentially bind small rnas 21 nt in length, and is expressed in developing ovules and anthers  <cit> . a dominant mutation affecting atago <dig> inhibits megagametogenesis following specification of the mmc; however, plants with null mutations in atago <dig> are fertile  <cit> . orthologs of atago <dig> such as mel <dig> in rice and ago5c in maize are also expressed within developing anthers and ovules, and mutations affecting mel <dig> cause arrest of meiosis and male sterility  <cit> .

whether hpago2b or hpago <dig> function in similar small rna pathways as their arabidopsis orthologs within hieracium ovaries has yet to be determined. copies of hpago2b and hpago <dig> do not appear to be missing from either the m <dig> or m <dig> genomes; however, their downregulation does suggest they could act downstream of processes required for the initiation of apospory. in situ analyses demonstrated that these two ago genes are broadly expressed throughout the ovary and flower , and further analysis using protein-specific antibodies could provide additional information regarding their function during ai cell development.

the majority of differentially expressed genes in m <dig> and m <dig> ovaries exhibit opposing directionality
in analysing differential gene expression of whole ovaries during ai cell development, we focussed on the two deletion mutants, m <dig> and m <dig>  which are derived from the r <dig> background. by examining ovaries from plants within the same background, noise from cross-species differences could be reduced as much as possible. additionally, m <dig> and m <dig> are part of a larger collection of deletion mutants in r <dig>  <cit> , and an existing mapping population within r <dig> provides a rapid means to determine linkage of identified candidate genes to the loa locus  <cit> .

comparisons between ovaries from r <dig> and the two deletion mutants  showed that the deletion mutants shared a large fraction of differentially expressed predicted gene models as compared to r <dig> at both stages examined . interestingly, although many predicted gene models were commonly differentially expressed within m <dig> and m <dig>  their fold changes were frequently found to be in opposing directions, with the majority of gene models showing increased expression in m <dig> ovaries and decreased expression in m <dig> ovaries relative to r <dig> . differentially expressed gene models that fell into this category made up greater than half of all differentially expressed genes in common between the two mutant comparisons at both stages. this would suggest that although the two mutants are phenotypically similar at the stages examined, the phenotypes are possibly the result of different causal mutations that affect common downstream pathways, or alternatively, similar causal mutations that are also affected by additional mutations in downstream pathways. it is also possible that the large number of commonly differentially expressed genes may not be related to the phenotype at all, or could be the result of similar large-scale genomic differences.

one possible explanation could be the genomic constituencies of the plants examined. gamma irradiation, through which m <dig> and m <dig> were generated, is known to cause large-scale genomic deletions and rearrangements, and occasionally affects chromosomal inheritance  <cit> . r <dig>  the background plant from which both m <dig> and m <dig> were generated, is a known aneuploid , whereas m <dig> plants have an extra chromosome    <cit> . the extra chromosome does not appear to carry the loa locus . the karyotype of m <dig> is currently unknown; however, m <dig> is thought to contain significant large-scale deletions, as most loa- and lop-linked markers examined to date have been found to be missing within this mutant  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that differentially expressed gene models with opposing fold change directions might be explained by loss or duplication of a similar chromosome or region.

differentially expressed predicted gene models in common between m <dig> and m <dig> were enriched for genes with go categories associated with chromatin silencing, rna-dependent dna methylation and small rna biogenesis . many of the genes found to be differentially expressed within these go categories have been shown to affect sexual lineage specification with arabidopsis and maize, including putative orthologs of zmago4d, atrdr <dig>  atdcl <dig>  atdcl <dig> and subunits of rna polymerases iv and v  <cit> . all of these putative orthologs showed opposing fold change directions, with decreased expression in m <dig> ovaries and increased expression in m <dig> ovaries relative to r <dig> at both stages . therefore, it is difficult to conclude whether the observed perturbation of these pathways is directly associated with loss of the apospory phenotype in these mutants.

integration of small rna and transcriptome data identifies putative sirna targets
our transcriptome analysis of r <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> ovaries suggested that a number of small rna biogenesis genes were differentially expressed as compared to r <dig> ovaries. however, comparisons of total small rna size distributions did not reveal any large-scale disruption in proportions of small rna size classes . this may be due to whole ovaries being used for this analysis, which would likely overwhelm any tissue-specific signals in small rna distributions.

despite this, a small number of genes differentially targeted by small rnas in both m <dig> and m <dig> were identified . an analysis of small rna targets with corresponding differential gene expression identified two putative exo-like genes to be downregulated in m <dig> and m <dig> ovaries, possibly through the rddm pathway, as both show an increase of highly similar 24-nt small rnas and decreased expression . the function of exo-like genes is not well characterized; however, they appear to be secreted into the cell wall, and are required for cell growth . exo-like genes have also been reported to be required for brassinosteroid-induced signalling . however, targeting of these genes by rddm in other species has not been previously reported. upregulation of the hpexo-like genes in r <dig> may represent growth and expansion of the ai cell, although further experiments will be required to determine if hpexo-like genes are required for apospory.

potential candidate genes in ai cell specification
specification of ai cell development within aposporous species of hieracium is postulated to require two non-mutually exclusive conditions . first, relaxation of sporophytic cell identity in the ovule tissue surrounding the sexually derived gametogenic cells seems probable. the second condition is the perception of signals for the specification and initiation of gametophyte development by those sporophytic cells, which is almost certain, as inhibiting meiosis in aposporous ovaries prevents ai cell initiation  <cit> . whether or how the loa locus is involved in either of these processes is currently poorly understood. following ai cell specification, development of the aposporous gametophyte would undoubtedly share many of the regulatory pathways required for the mitotic events of sexual gametophyte development  <cit> .fig.  <dig> summary of potential candidate genes involved in ai cell specification. a schematic of an ovule from aposporous hieracium depicting postulated conditions required for the initiation of ai cell development. the relaxation of sporophyte identity , in conjunction with the perception of signals to initiate gametophyte development , leads to specification of ai cells with a mitotic gametophyte identity. potential genes and pathways identified in this analysis that may play a role in leading to the postulated conditions required for ai cell specification are listed on the right




in the presentation of our newly generated genomic and transcriptomic resource, we performed an initial analysis of transcriptional changes within ovaries during the early stages of ai cell specification. in our analysis we identified a number of candidates that could potentially play a role in the specification and initiation of ai cells . for example, hpago2b, hpago <dig>  hpexo-like and hplox <dig> appear to be downregulated in ovaries from both m <dig> and m <dig> relative to r <dig>  the function of these genes within hieracium is currently unknown, but their orthologous functions in other species make them intriguing candidates. other broader transcriptional changes in common between m <dig> and m <dig> ovaries, such as the perturbation of the rddm pathway, or genes involved in cell growth and cell wall modifications may represent a loss of ai-permissive conditions within these mutant ovaries. but it is also quite possible that the observed changes could be unrelated to ai cell development.

with the exception of hplox <dig>  which has been previously shown to be associated with the ai cell  <cit> , the localization of differential expression within ovaries of these genes is unknown, and as whole ovary tissue was used in this initial analysis, it is difficult to place the observed changes into a structured regulatory pathway. nevertheless, future research should clarify any roles these genes might play, and the resources generated here will play an invaluable role in these analyses.

CONCLUSIONS
we have introduced a comprehensive toolkit for research into the early events of apomictic initiation observed in hieracium species. the developed toolkit includes a previously unavailable genomic assembly coupled to transcriptome and small rna sequencing of both sexual and apomictic ovaries at two developmental stages across early aposporous and sexual events. this toolkit will significantly support research towards uncovering the molecular events underpinning the apospory phenotype. we have demonstrated the efficacy of these developed resources by using them to identify common deleted genomic regions within m <dig> and m <dig> that are linked to loa, in addition to comparing differences in small rna pathways between ovaries of sexual and apomictic plants. future work will focus on clarifying the role of these observed differences in sexual and apomictic hieracium species, with particular emphasis on using additional transcriptomes generated through laser-assisted microdissection to identify cell type-specific genes for functional testing. the d <dig> genomic resource will also prove useful in the analysis of other aspects of research in hieracium, such as autonomous seed formation.
