BACKGROUND
foxi <dig> is a family member of the forkhead-box  transcription factors that are characterized by the fox ~ <dig> amino acid monomeric dna-binding domain  <cit> . different mutations in the human foxi <dig> gene and its regulatory binding site on slc26a <dig>  have been shown to compromise the transcription of this anion transporter gene in patients with pendred syndrome and nonsyndromic enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct  <cit> . foxi <dig> has also been recognised as a key factor necessary for correct patterning of distal nephron epithelium and adequate acid-base homeostasis in the kidney causing distal renal tubular acidosis in foxi1-/- mice  <cit> . moreover, foxi <dig> has been reported to be a crucial activator of the b1-subunit of the vacuolar h+ -atpase proton pump  as well as for pendrin  and carbonic anhydrase ii expression in the epididymal cells, which are required for a correct mouse sperm maturation  <cit> . overall, these findings have led to the hypothesis that mutations in the human foxi <dig> gene might cause sensorineural deafness with distal renal tubular acidosis and male infertility  <cit> .

thus, foxi <dig> seems to be involved in the acid-base balance of at least three different organs: inner ear, testis, and kidney. using human-chimpanzee-mouse orthologous gene trios, foxi <dig> was suggested as an example of a gene involved in hearing that appeared to present a subset of sites with accelerated amino acid substitution in the human lineage  <cit> . however, the availability of additional foxi orthologous sequences from a variety of species, including other primates, has permitted this initial finding to be revised. genes involved in sensory perception show accelerated evolution or are under positive selection in the human lineage  <cit> . reproduction was only found as a biological function showing an excess of positively selected genes when comparing human and chimpanzee, and thus it could not be established in which of the two branches positive selection acted  <cit> . within humans, adaptation to different climates may have entailed adapting kidney function to varying hydration levels. for instance, a thrifty genotype in water retention is suggested to have been selected in the gruelling trans-atlantic voyage of the slave ships, resulting in a higher prevalence of hypertension in african-americans  <cit> . moreover, variants influencing salt homeostasis in the cyp3a <dig> and agt loci have been shown to be targets of a selective pressure varying in intensity in correlation with latitude  <cit> . it is of great interest, therefore, to investigate whether fox1i has been the target of local adaptation in humans. in order to test such a hypothesis, we evaluated the patterns of nucleotide variation and looked for signals of positive natural selection in the human foxi <dig> gene by resequencing  <dig> europeans,  <dig> asians and  <dig> yorubas and by assaying snp variation in  <dig> individuals from the human genome diversity panel .

methods
population samples
sixty hapmap dna samples for resequencing were obtained from coriell cell repositories . these consisted of  <dig> europeans ,  <dig> asians  and  <dig> yorubas . coriell repository numbers for these samples are listed in table s <dig> .

snp genotypes were obtained for the human genome diversity panel , which contains  <dig>  dna samples from individuals representing  <dig> populations globally distributed  <cit> . in all statistical analyses atypical, duplicated individuals and deduced first-degree relatives were removed by using the h <dig> subset recommended by rosenberg  <cit> . in order to maximize sample sizes, genotyped samples were re-grouped into  <dig> populations based on geographic and ethnic criteria as in gardner et al.  <cit> . for part of the analysis, populations were further grouped into seven geographical regions: sub-saharan africa , middle east-north africa , europe , central-south asia , east asia , oceania  and america .

all samples used were originally collected with proper informed consent. the research protocol was approved by the clinical research ethical committee of the municipal institute of health care .

resequencing of the foxi <dig> gene
we amplified two overlapping fragments of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp covering the entire foxi <dig> genomic sequence. pcrs were performed in a total volume of  <dig> μl, containing  <dig>  mm dntps,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  μm of each primer , 1× buffer,  <dig>  u taq polymerase , and  <dig> ng genomic dna. pcr conditions were as follows:  <dig> min at 94°c,  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> sec, 55°c for  <dig> sec and 72°c for  <dig> min; and a final step of extension of  <dig> min at 72°c. pcr products were purified using multiscreen pcrμ <dig> chemistry  according to the manufacturer's protocol. amplified pcr products were sequenced using big dye terminator chemistry ver. <dig>   and the sequencing primers listed in table s <dig> . extension products were purified using the montage seq <dig> cleanup kit  and run on an abi  <dig> xl sequencer. sequence analysis and contig assembly for each sample were performed with the seqman module of the dnastar lasergene software ver.  <dig> . <dig> and visually inspected at least twice. all polymorphic sites were checked manually and heterozygote positions were confirmed by reamplifying and resequencing the snp site from the same or the opposite strand. nucleotide sequence data reported are available in the genbank database under accession numbers gu <dig> to gu <dig> 

snp genotyping data
a total of  <dig> snps covering  <dig> kb centered on the foxi <dig> gene region were genotyped on the hgdp-ceph diversity panel. snps were selected every 5- <dig> kb within the gene and up to around  <dig> kb in both 5' and 3' end flanking regions; from this point, an extra snp was then added every  <dig> kb up to around  <dig> kb in both flanking regions. preference was given to snps with a minor allele frequency  over 10%, which were compiled from hapmap  and dbsnp  databases. snps were typed using the snplex genotyping system from applied biosystems within a larger set of snps covering additional genes as described elsewhere  <cit> . illumina humanhap650k beadchip genotypes on the hgdp-ceph panel were downloaded from the stanford human genome center website. from this publicly available data we extracted a snp genotype set centered on foxi <dig> and extending up to  <dig> mb , which was complemented by  <dig> of our previously genotyped snps.

statistical analysis
in order to test for positive selection in the human lineage we initially applied the improved branch-site test  <dig> of positive selection  <cit>  on a phylogeny containing five mammalian species . the human reference sequence for foxi <dig> and its orthologous sequences in chimpanzee, mouse, rat and dog had been previously extracted from ensembl  and aligned with clustalw  <cit> . the alignment length was  <dig>  bp, which became  <dig>  bp  after removing gaps . calculations for the corresponding null and alternative hypotheses were performed using the codeml program implemented in the paml package  <cit> . results for additional likelihood ratio tests of positive selection on the human lineage considering different multispecies alignments were obtained from the human paml browser  <cit> . table s <dig>  summarises the likelihood ratio test results for the branch test  and for the strict branch positive site test of positive selection .

arlequin  <cit>  was used to calculate fst values among the  <dig> populations studied with a locus by locus analysis of molecular variance   <cit> . haplotypes were inferred from sequencing data using the bayesian statistical method in the program phase  <dig>   <cit>  using the default parameter set with  <dig>  iterations. haplotype estimation from the  <dig> kb and  <dig> mb snp genotype data sets was performed with fastphase  <cit> . the network  <dig> . <dig>  software package  was used to construct the minimum mutation network by means of the median-joining algorithm  <cit> . the ancestral states for the foxi <dig> polymorphic positions were inferred from the previously aligned orthologous sequences in chimpanzee, mouse and rat but adding macaque  to the alignment.

nucleotide diversity statistics and analysis of population polymorphic sites were carried out with the foxi <dig> resequencing data and the dnasp software ver.  <dig>   <cit> . departures from neutrality were tested by means of tajima's d, fu and li's f, f*, d and d* and fay and wu's h tests. in order to obtain realistic distributions for the statistics and thus evaluate evidence for natural selection, we performed  <dig>  coalescent simulations using cosi version  <dig>   <cit> . as some demographic effects  and positive selection have similar effects on genealogies  <cit>  those simulations included the ad-hoc, continent-specific human demographic calibration described in schaffner et al.  <cit>  and that is provided with the cosi source code. we used an infinite-sites model, with s fixed as the number of segregating sites found, and the length of the simulated sequence was set to the length of the sequence analyzed . the recombination rates used were those estimated for the region  <cit> . the critical value for each statistic was obtained from the empirical distribution of the corresponding neutral model with a significance level of  <dig> . for the whole human sample, dnasp software ver.  <dig>   <cit>  was used to produce coalescent neutral simulations with a constant population size.

for every population we analyzed the distribution of the minor allele frequencies  and the derived allele frequencies  of the corresponding snps along  <dig> mb centered on foxi <dig>  the proportion of snps with allele frequencies higher or lower than a defined threshold  was calculated within sliding windows of  <dig> kb in size every  <dig> kb and plotted against distance as in moreno-estrada et al.  <cit> . we constructed independent distributions for each population with additional genotype data generated elsewhere  <cit> . regions enriched by windows in the top 5% of the corresponding distribution were considered as outliers. given their small sample size , the san population was not included in the maf threshold analysis. ancestral states for all analyzed snps were obtained from the chimpanzee and/or the macaque genome sequences .

unusually long range haplotypes along the  <dig> mb region centered on foxi <dig> were explored by applying two complementary ehh-based approaches especially designed to detect intermediate frequency and fixed  selected variants. for the first approach, we applied both the long range haplotype  test  <cit>  and the ihs statistic  <cit> , and for the second we used the xp-rsb statistic  <cit> . the lrh test was carried out using the sweep software package  defining cores as the longest non-overlapping core haplotypes with at least one snp and not more than  <dig> snps. in order to obtain additional data for a background distribution of ehh values we used phased haplotype data for eleven  <dig> mb regions studied elsewhere  <cit> . for each core haplotype identified, we calculated the ehh and the relative ehh  at varying distances from the core for each main continental region separately. more specifically, marker h  of  <dig>  and  <dig>  were selected as they are roughly equivalent to a genetic distance of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm, respectively . core haplotypes were placed in 5% frequency bins and the respective ehh and rehh values were log-transformed for each bin in order to obtain approximately normally distributed values. the empirical significance of the lrh test was estimated by means of p and q values as in moreno-estrada et al.  <cit> . the integrated haplotype score  was estimated as previously described  <cit>  using publicly available genotype data for ~ <dig>  genome-wide distributed snps in  <dig> populations from the hgdp-ceph diversity panel  <cit> . with an approach similar to that described by nielsen et al.  <cit>  to detect regions with aberrant allele frequency spectra , we applied a composite likelihood test to detect regions with aberrant "ihs spectra". we first divided |ihs| in bins of size  <dig> , and then estimated the probability that a snp had an |ihs| value in a particular bin, both for each snp in the whole genome dataset  as well as for each sliding window of  <dig> snps over the whole genome. two composite likelihoods were estimated for each window, one by multiplying the probabilities obtained from the window itself, and the other by multiplying the probabilities obtained from the whole genome. a log-likelihood ratio was then formed comparing both likelihoods, where extreme values indicate unusual distributions of ihs in the respective window compared to the rest of the genome. for each snp this log-likelihood ratio for the window centered on the snp is referred to as windowed ihs in results. finally, in order to allow for multiple population comparisons of ehh, we computed xp-rsb for every snp site and population versus all other hgdp-ceph populations as described in moreno-estrada et al.  <cit> . in order to assess significance, we obtained a p-value for each population and snp site along the foxi <dig> region by ranking its xp-rsb value with respect to the genome-wide distribution generated with the ~ <dig>  snps from li et al.  <cit> . we then log transformed the p-values and plotted them against position, searching for clusters of significant values inside or around the foxi <dig> gene.

RESULTS
foxi <dig> divergence patterns
the recent increase of available newly sequenced genomes led us to re-evaluate the initial evidence of non-neutral evolution of foxi <dig> in the human lineage obtained with three-species sequence alignments  <cit> . when considering a phylogeny of five mammals, the improved branch-site test  <dig> of positive selection  <cit>  rejected the hypothesis of positive selection at a subset of sites in the human branch . we also investigated the patterns of foxi <dig> protein evolution from several multiple sequence alignments, including additional non-human primates besides chimpanzee. we used two maximum likelihood methods  to specifically test for:  a dn/ds ratio on the human branch significantly different from  <dig>  and  codon sites with a dn/ds ratio significantly different from  <dig> in the human lineage. overall foxi <dig> did not present significantly accelerated amino acid substitution rates or particular codon sites undergoing positive selection in the human branch in any of the comparisons .

patterns of foxi <dig> sequence variation
polymorphic variation in the foxi <dig> gene was investigated by sequencing  <dig>  bp, encompassing its two exons, most of its untranslated regions, and its corresponding intronic region, in  <dig> yorubas,  <dig> asians and  <dig> europeans. we found  <dig> sequence variations:  <dig> substitutions and one deletion/insertion polymorphism . among them, six were singletons: one in yorubas, three in europeans and two in asians. one of the asian-specific singletons was the only non-synonymous substitution observed , an asn to ser replacement at amino acid position  <dig> for isoform a . the remaining three exonic polymorphisms were synonymous changes. twenty of the  <dig> sequence variations detected here had been previously reported in dbsnp build  <dig>  excluding singleton variants, we identified a total of  <dig> haplotypes . half of the analysed chromosomes belonged to either ht- <dig> or ht- <dig>  found in all three populations studied. we found three specific haplotypes for africans, three for europeans, but none specific for asians. in order to visualize the phylogenetic relationships among the identified haplotypes we constructed a median-joining network; ht- <dig> carried ancestral alleles at each snp . the reticulated pattern observed in the network points to the action of recurrent mutation or recombination. however, given that more than one nucleotide position is often involved, the latter seems more likely as a mechanism for producing new sequence variation.

summary statistics of genetic diversity and neutrality tests for foxi <dig> are reported in table  <dig>  these levels of diversity are in agreement with estimates from other genomic regions sequenced in a similar set of samples . notably, in the yoruban population the number of segregating sites, and different haplotypes as well as values of nucleotide diversity were similar to the european population sample. however, in africans haplotype diversity was lower. in order to investigate the possible genetic footprint of selection we performed several neutrality tests on each of these three populations and on the whole human sample . significance was estimated by means of coalescent simulations under each inferred past demography  <cit>  or in the case of the whole human sample by considering constant population size. none of the neutrality statistics displayed significant departure from neutrality .

patterns of snp variation in foxi1
in order to widen both the genomic context and the range of human populations analyzed, we also explored the pattern of snp variation along a  <dig> mb region centered on foxi <dig> in  <dig> worldwide human populations covering more human genetic diversity than the three samples we sequenced. in particular, we looked for an excess of low frequency variants, the presence of high frequency derived alleles, and unusually long range haplotypes. these possible signatures of natural selection persist in the human genome at varying time scales, and therefore give information about adaptative events occurring at different intervals during our evolutionary history  <cit> . for each population and within multiple  <dig> kb sliding windows along the foxi1-centered  <dig> mb region we separately plotted:  the proportion of snps with maf < <dig>   and  the proportion of snps with daf > <dig>  . in both analyses, no particular pattern emerged around or surrounding the foxi <dig> gene in any of the populations studied. however, when searching for signatures of unusually long haplotypes, we found strong signals from all the three statistics we applied. first, according to the lrh test  <cit> , up to five different core haplotypes close to foxi <dig> clearly stood out with relatively high frequencies  and significant rehh values in the yoruba population . a picture of the unusual ehh breakdown around foxi <dig> in yorubas is presented in figure  <dig>  similarly, in sub-saharan africans  from the hgdp-ceph diversity panel, the complete foxi <dig> gene region was clearly enriched for outliers of the ihs statistic  <cit> , reaching significant values within the top 1% of the genome-wide distribution  . the strongest signals were located inside foxi <dig> and extended several kb downstream in agreement with the location of the most significant core haplotypes observed with the lrh test described above. when ranking all genes in the genome by their maximum windowed ihs within the gene region , foxi <dig> was ranked number  <dig> out of  <dig>   in the ssafr continental sample. finally, we used the xp-rsb statistic  <cit>  to compare the integrated ehh at each particular snp site in a population with that averaged across multiple populations . interestingly, a cluster of significant xp-rsb values was detected in the foxi <dig> region for the yoruba  and mandenka  african populations. figure  <dig> shows genome-wide significance for xp-rsb at every snp site and population plotted against distance along the  <dig> mb region centered in foxi <dig>  the cluster of significant values involving foxi <dig> was exclusively observed in africans and also correlates with the location of the lrh and ihs signals previously described. other significant values can be seen in figure  <dig>  for example, at  <dig>  mb for the french population, and around  <dig> mb for n. italy. these signals lie well beyond foxi <dig> and, given the pattern of linkage disequilibrium in the region, are most certainly unrelated to this gene.

we next explored what may have been the functional variation underlying the recent selection signal detected in africa by these two ehh-based approaches. to that effect, using hapmap data  <cit>  we studied the linkage disequilibrium  pattern around foxi <dig> in the yoruban population and found a ld block containing foxi <dig> in a region of ~ <dig> kb between two hotspots of recombination. as shown in figure s <dig> , a similar ld block structure was detected in the yoruban population of the hgdp-ceph panel. then we screened all known snp variation for a putative functional effect using pupasuite  <cit>  in a ~ <dig> kb segment containing the previously identified ld block and all the significant core haplotypes found in the foxi <dig> gene region . out of  <dig> snps we detected  <dig> as functionally relevant polymorphisms . since we have found that the footprint of natural selection seems to be evident in africans, we can narrow down that candidate list by rejecting the snps with small frequency differences between africans and non-africans. after removing the snps with an absolute difference in maf between africans and europeans smaller than  <dig> , only six snps remained. five of them affect exonic splicing enhancers either for the dock <dig> gene  or the foxi <dig> gene , while rs <dig> creates a new transcription factor binding site for foxi <dig>  except for rs <dig>  which maps further away, these snps are all within the  <dig> kb block described above. therefore, they  are the best candidates to represent the functional variation that caused this signature of selection.

finally, in order to explore a possible relation between climate and foxi <dig> variation, we tested for correlation between allele frequencies and absolute latitude for the snps in the significant core haplotypes in the lrh test, snps with significant values for the ihs and xp-rsb statistics, and rs <dig> . out of  <dig> snps, correlation with absolute latitude was nominally significant  for  <dig> of them. all significant core haplotypes contained at least one snp with significant correlation with absolute latitude , and rs <dig> was also significantly correlated with latitude . the most significant correlation  was for allele a at rs <dig> in core accc , implying that its frequency decreases towards higher latitudes . since the most significant event to shape human genetic diversity was the out of africa migration, we recalculated partial correlation coefficients with absolute latitude by controlling for the geographical distance to east africa . all the significant correlations mentioned above remained significant, implying that the dispersion out of africa is not a meaningful confounding factor for this result. however, when put in a genomic context, these correlations are not exceptional: out of  <dig>  snps with minor allele frequency > <dig>  genotyped in the same individuals by li et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> % had more extreme correlations with absolute latitude, and 14% after correcting for distance to east africa.

discussion
genes related to fertility and/or sensory perception may have been driven by accelerated evolution in humans, but, contrary to clark et al.  <cit> , we did not find in the human branch such acceleration of the foxi <dig> gene, which is involved in the function of the ear, testis, and kidney  <cit> . it is recognised that the accuracy and power of likelihood ratio tests  for detecting positive selection improve with the number of species used in such approaches  <cit> . consequently, we used the human paml browser  <cit>  in order to perform both branch and branch-site tests of positive selection in multiple species comparisons containing several mammals and additional primates to human and chimpanzee. none of the tests performed indicated positive selection for the foxi <dig> coding sequence in the lineage leading to humans. however, ω is ~ <dig> in many branches of the foxi <dig> phylogeny , which suggests that the foxi <dig> amino acid replacement rate is equally fast in all branches and that comparative lrts such as the ones performed here may lack power to detect positive selection in any particular lineage. in any case, we did not find evidence of a specific evolution pattern for foxi <dig> in the lineage leading to humans.

variation in the foxi <dig> gene sequence was compatible with neutral evolution in samples of africans, east asians and europeans. however, patterns of extended linkage disequilibrium in the foxi <dig> gene region suggested recent positive selection in some of the african samples of the hgdp-ceph diversity panel  <cit> . half of the snps with significant values for the ihs or xp-rsb statistics and of those contained in significant cores haplotypes in the lrh test correlated with latitude, suggesting a possible role for climate in the adaptation mediated by foxi <dig>  a higher correlation with latitude may not have been reached due to the apparent recentness of the selective event and its restriction to sub-saharan african populations. an alternative explanation  is geographically localized selection at the dock <dig> gene, which encodes for a cytoplasmatic protein required for lymphocyte chemotaxis in response to chemokines  <cit> . it is suggested that patterns of linkage disequilibrium pinpoint recent selective events, while the accumulation of variation by mutation requires some time before sequence-based neutrality statistics become significant  <cit> . the finding of no significant deviation from neutral evolution with statistics such as tajima's d, or fay and wu's h has been previously recognized to be consistent with the low power of these traditional tests to detect recent selective sweeps as for example in the case of the g6pd locus  <cit> . moreover, tests based on the allele frequency spectrum have low power to detect incomplete sweeps, especially after a selective event in standing genetic variation  <cit> . interestingly, while nucleotide and haplotype diversities tend to be higher in africans than in other populations, this was not the case for foxi <dig>  which could be taken as further evidence of positive selection in africans. no non-synonymous coding snps were found in the core haplotypes or their linked variation. therefore, taken as a whole, our results suggest that recent selection may have acted on the expression rather than on the amino acid sequence of foxi <dig>  based on two extensive collections of microarray data from a large variety of available human tissue samples, genevestigator  <cit>  and genesapiens  <cit> , foxi <dig> has the highest mrna expression levels in kidney . fittingly, among the diverse functions of this transcription factor, its role in the kidney as a master regulator of vacuolar h+-atpase proton pump subunits  <cit>  might be an intriguing candidate function for climate adaptation through water-electrolyte homeostasis and prevention of dehydration. if that were the case, foxi <dig> would join the ranks of the growing number of known genes such as fabp <dig>  raptor and slc24a <dig>  <cit>  that allowed humans to adapt to the diversity of climates we encountered during our past expansion.

CONCLUSIONS
we have found no genetic evidence of accelerated protein evolution for the foxi <dig> gene in the human lineage; however, within humans we have discovered signatures of a recent episode of positive selection in african populations. our evolutionary approach identifies directions for future functional analyses of how genetic variation in the foxi <dig> gene region can result in phenotypic differences among human populations, which might be related to water-electrolyte homeostasis.
