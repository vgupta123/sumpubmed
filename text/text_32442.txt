BACKGROUND
globally the order rodentia represents the richest mammalian diversity  <cit> , yet species and higher level classification within the order remains to be resolved due to controversies surrounding morphological character evolution in the group  <cit> . the old world subfamily murinae is the most diverse within the species-rich family muridae  <cit> . africa is one of the centres of endemism of the subfamily and based on combined mitochondrial and nuclear gene data, it has been suggested that the major african radiation occurred in the miocene   <cit> . the latter and other recent studies  <cit>  of african murids highlighted the impact of miocene and pliocene climatic changes on vegetation and landscape composition  and linked the rapid radiation within several taxa to the expansion of savanna habitats.

murid diversity within the southern african subregion remains underestimated as few local taxa have been assessed for intraspecific variation. most of the earlier studies were based on traditional morphometrics and/or qualitative morphology, e.g. studies on species within the genera acomys  <cit> , saccostomus  <cit> , mastomys  <cit> , aethomys  <cit>  and micaelamys . recently molecular studies investigated otomys  <cit> , mastomys  <cit> , micaelamys  <cit> , rhabdomys  <cit>  and saccostomus  <cit> . these molecular studies suggest high levels of cryptic diversity, a feature also reported for other african murids .

in general, small mammals such as rodents have restricted dispersal abilities  <cit>  and many display patchy distributions. smaller rodents in particular show adaptation to specific micro-habitats and would likely be more sensitive to environmental changes  <cit> . indeed, habitat selection, dispersion and inter-specific competition are proposed to be amongst the most important factors influencing the co-existence of species  <cit> . in addition, karyotypic changes have been implicated in the speciation of several rodent species .

the focus of the present study is the namaqua rock mouse, micaelamys namaquensis smith,  <dig>  originally described from witwater, little namaqualand in the northern cape province of south africa  <cit> . the genus aethomys thomas,  <dig> was formerly subdivided into two african endemic subgenera namely micaelamys and aethomys  <cit> . recent molecular studies  <cit>  reported the paraphyly of the genus and the two subgenera have since been elevated to full generic rank  <cit> . the genus micaelamys ellerman,  <dig> includes m. namaquensis and m. granti wroughton,  <dig>  while aethomys includes the remaining nine species. the close relationship between m. namaquensis and m. granti is evident from dental morphology  <cit> , karyology  <cit> , gross sperm and bacular morphology  <cit>  and cranial phenetic analysis  <cit> .

fossil species of aethomys have been recorded from langebaanweg   <cit> . it is noteworthy that the smaller of the two fossil species closely resembles the extant m. namaquensis, which may be indicative of the long-term presence of this species in the subregion  <cit> . the oldest known representatives of the genus, a. adamanticola and a. modernis, have been recorded in south africa and date to between the early pleistocene and late miocene  <cit> .

micaelamys namaquensis is widely distributed in southern african , but has also been recorded to the north of the subregion in angola, zambia, malawi and northern mozambique  <cit> . these rodents are catholic in their habitat requirements but where there are rocky outcrops or hillsides they will use these in preference to any other type of habitat  <cit> . the social structure of the species has not been elucidated but colonies appear to live in rock crevices, in or under fallen logs or in holes in trees  <cit> . they are mostly granivores  <cit>  and breed during the warmer spring and summer months  <cit> . they are known for unstable population cycles associated with high mortality and high reproductive potential  <cit> . such cycles would likely leave clear 'footprints' in the distribution of genetic diversity in the species.

the namaqua rock mouse shows considerable geographic variation such as in pelage colouration, tail length and body size throughout its distributional range  <cit> . this variation suggested that m. namaquensis may reflect either a complex of species  <cit>  or subspecies  <cit> . earlier reports  <cit>  recognised  <dig> subspecies within m. namaquensis . however, these distinctions were primarily based on a limited number of geographically restricted samples  <cit> , with little or no assessment of patterns of geographic variation over the entire distributional range of the species.

a comprehensive intraspecific morphometric study within m. namaquensis from southern africa  <cit>  suggested the recognition of four subspecies differing in both cranial size and shape: m. n. namaquensis smith,  <dig>  m. n. lehocla smith,  <dig>  m. n. alborarius peters,  <dig> and m. n. monticularis jameson,  <dig>  this study also suggested that the geographical limits of the proposed subspecies broadly coincide with the major phytogeographical zones of southern africa  <cit>  : the subspecies namaquensis was shown to be largely associated with a combination of the succulent karoo, fynbos and the southern coastal savanna/grassland region of the eastern cape, kwazulu-natal and eastern mpumalanga provinces of south africa, while the subspecies alborarius and lehocla were shown to be associated with the savanna and upper/lower karoo biomes, respectively  <cit> . the subspecies monticularis was largely confined to the grassland biome of southern africa  <cit>  .

given its wide distribution and past indications of cryptic diversity, we investigated the cyt b variation of m. namaquensis as a potential model for murine diversification in southern africa. our objectives are: 1) to evaluate the phylogeographic structure in this widespread species; 2) to compare patterns of genetic variation with previously described morphological variation; 3) to evaluate the geographical association between the observed diversity and environmental features of the region and 4) to consider the divergence times in terms of the climatic and vegetation changes characterising southern africa over the recent evolutionary past.

RESULTS
the 5' end of the cyt b gene  was sequenced for  <dig> m. namaquensis individuals. all sequences obtained were of the mtdna cyt b gene with conserved domains and nucleotide composition biases typical of this mtdna protein coding gene  <cit> . as expected, most of the substitutions were silent, with only  <dig> of the  <dig> amino acid sites being variable. the  <dig> variable nucleotide positions defined  <dig> maternal alleles , the allele frequencies and geographic distributions are indicated in additional file  <dig>  sequence divergence values based on uncorrected p-distances ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % between the alleles. only four widespread and high frequency alleles were recorded , while most of the remaining alleles were locality-specific . the overall nucleotide diversity was 3%, while the allelic diversity value of  <dig>  corresponded to those reported for other rodents  <cit> .

unique lineages were defined based on the joint interpretation of a bayesian gene tree , an ultrametric analysis in beast  and an allele network as estimated in tcs  . we thus propose the presence of eight lineages  with varying degrees of intra-lineage diversity. we do not present individual lineage phylogeographic patterns in detail but indicate some of the subdivisions  and use lineages a <dig> and d to illustrate heterogeneous and homogeneous diversity patterns, respectively.

the bayesian phylogram  is characterised by short internal branches suggesting a rapid radiation of lineages. this is supported by the relatively short timeframe over which these lineages became established during the early pleistocene and late pliocene  . two major periods of subsequent radiation within the lineages is evident at approximately  <dig>  -  <dig>  mya  and from  <dig> kya to  <dig> mya .

with the exception of lineage h, the monophyly of the respective lineages are statistically supported by the bayesian posterior probability values . sister relationships are not consistent across the phylogenetic analyses and statistical support is largely lacking . however, lineages a and b and lineages c, d and e are potential sister clades. in addition, these two clades appear to share a common history. the beast analysis further suggest a sister relationship between g and h; these two distinctive lineages are consistently placed sister to the remainder of the lineages. the position of lineage f is inconsistent between the different analyses.

the tcs analysis connected alleles separated by up to  <dig> mutational steps ; only lineage h and a subset of the lineage b alleles  could not be joined to the remainder of the network . lineage d shows a star-like pattern of  <dig> closely related alleles recorded over a large geographic area. seven of the alleles were shared between two to six localities; these included both ancestral and derived alleles, indicative of retention of ancestral polymorphisms as well as more recent expansions of this lineage. in contrast, most of the other lineages harboured more divergent alleles, as evident by the presence of intervening, extinct or un-sampled alleles. for example, lineage a <dig> was characterised by six alleles that were shared between localities while the remaining alleles were locality specific. some of these shared alleles were more derived but some  were still ancestral. the nucleotide and haplotype diversity estimates within the lineages are shown in table  <dig>  lineages a <dig> and f showed the highest within lineage sequence divergences .

lineage letter codes as defined in this table are used in all other figures, tables and additional files.

most lineages form separate geographical units displaying an allopatric/parapatric pattern of distribution . major physical features of the southern african landscape  do not appear to separate the lineages . one exception is the enigmatic lineage f that appears to be restricted to high elevations of the great escarpment. however, most lineages and in some instances also the sub-clades within them, appear to be associated with different vegetation types of southern africa: lineage a  with different bioregions of the grassland and savanna biomes; b <dig> with albany thicket; b <dig> with the western fynbos; c with the bushmanland/upper karoo bioregion ; d with the nama-karoo; e with the kalahari duneveld ; f with the sub-escarpment grassland bioregion ; g with the eastern kalahari bushveld ; and h with savanna. names in parenthesis  refer to biomes as indicated in figure  <dig>  for bioregion names not referred to in figure  <dig> and for more detailed maps see  <cit> .

in addition to the distributions above, lineages d and e were also sampled from geographically distant localities . lineage a <dig> also has a disjunct distribution including individuals from fouriesburg  and kasane  which are approximately  <dig>  <dig> km apart. lineages a <dig> and b <dig> were only recorded from single localities, koppies dam nature reserve  and volksrust , respectively . several of the lineages were found in sympatry , for example, lineages a <dig>  c and d were recorded with several other lineages.

there is good support for the association between lineages and the major biomes of southern africa  as shown by the ml phylogram . bootstrap values are indicated and different colours correspond to different biomes . alleles within most lineages are associated with single biomes  or two neighbouring biomes . although its core association is with the nama-karoo biome, lineage d is geographically the most widespread  across several neighbouring biomes.

a mantel nonparametric test for lineages identified in the phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses  revealed isolation by distance for four of the clades . in most instances, the standard normal variate  was smaller than the critical value of  <dig>  at p ≤  <dig> , indicating that the null-hypothesis  could not be rejected. mantel tests could not be performed for lineages represented by too few individuals.

discussion
the analysis of the mtdna cyt b gene in the present study supports previous suggestions that m. namaquensis from southern africa is polytypic  <cit> . the present analysis, however, reveals a much higher degree of variation, comparable with other small mammalian taxa  <cit> . this is in contrast to a morphometric study that proposed the recognition of only four subspecies within m. namaquensis  <cit> . the detection of partial overlap between intra-lineage and inter-lineage divergences suggests the need for combined analyses with nuclear genes and more detailed morphological/behavioural data to fully resolve species-level diversity and the biogeographic history of this group of murid rodents that may represent a species complex.

levels of variation seen here are comparable to those of other within-population or within-species comparisons in muroid rodents. for example, sequence divergence within andean mice of the genus akodon ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> %  <cit> . there is currently no consensus as to the sequence divergence level associated with particular taxonomic ranks  <cit> . while  <cit>  suggested that values of 4% reflect inter-specific differences in rodents,  <cit>  advocated values higher than 11% at this level.  <cit>  cautioned against the use of sequence divergence levels in assigning specific status. possible problems may also arise from interpreting evolutionary history entirely on the basis of one gene. however, it is significant that some of the lineages identified in the present study have previously been proposed as subspecies on classical morphological/morphometric grounds  <cit> .

consideration of m. namaquensis diversity within a biological species concept  framework would require accurate delineation of the distributional boundaries of the identified lineages and mapping of areas of overlap through further sampling and genetic analyses. in areas of either sympatry  or parapatry , the presence or absence of hybrids  could be used to test the breeding integrity of these groups. breeding isolation has for example, been shown between a. chrysophilus and a. ineptus using karyology and sperm and bacular morphology  <cit> .

the remarkable karyotypic diversity found in small mammals suggests that speciation may be associated with karyotypic changes  <cit> . this is certainly true for some rodents that include variation in diploid numbers  <cit> . other examples include southern african rodent species within the genera mastomys, saccostomus and otomys where morphologically similar but genetically distinct species complexes have been identified using karyotypes and/or protein electromorph mobility  <cit> . a single diploid number  has thus far been reported in m. namaquensis  <cit>  however, karyotypic variation, in addition to locally adaptive physiological and/or behavioural responses  <cit>  may have played a significant role in speciation.

three major periods of diversification were identified in the present study:  <dig>  -  <dig>  mya ,  <dig>  -  <dig>  mya , and  <dig> kya to  <dig> mya . the most significant time for m. namaquensis diversification therefore corresponds to the pleistocene and pliocene, a period characterised by major climatic and vegetation changes with direct and indirect impacts on animal populations  <cit> .

the early pleistocene and pliocene were characterised by uplifts which raised the interior plateaus of south africa more than  <dig>  <dig> m above the miocene level  <cit> . between  <dig> and  <dig>  mya, a severe temperature drop  resulted in a rapid and dramatic sea level drop of over  <dig> m worldwide. the temperature during the subsequent period appeared to have fluctuated until between  <dig>  -  <dig>  mya. since then, temperatures have oscillated between glacial and interglacial conditions at least  <dig> times during the last  <dig>  million years with individual cycles having a mean duration of about  <dig>  <dig> years  <cit> .

these temperature changes had a definite impact on vegetation and may have contributed to speciation in southern african mammals  <cit> . the three major periods of diversification of m. namaquensis lineages correspond to periods of aridification  that also affected the southern african environment  <cit> . these arid periods alternated with wetter conditions so that populations were shifting continuously  <cit> . these cycles could have resulted in speciation, either through physical isolation  or changes in habitat .

the diversification within the m. namaquensis species complex also coincides with the timeframe proposed for the rapid radiation within the african murinae  <cit> . current fossil evidence also suggests that representatives of the genera aethomys  and micaelamys  were present in southern africa since the late miocene and one of these fossils closely resembles the extant m. namaquensis  <cit> . the expansion and contraction of savanna habitats across especially the eastern and southern parts of africa during the pliocene and miocene have been linked to speciation in several other rodent genera, for example tatera  <cit> , hylomyscus  <cit>  and praomys  <cit> . based on the timing and pattern of diversification in m. namaquensis and these other broadly co-distributed rodents, we propose that vicariance, dispersal and local adaptation shaped the diverse rodent fauna of the continent and likely also the southern african subregion.

the chronology  and habitat association  presented here suggest that the initial radiation within m. namaquensis was in open habitats  in the northern parts of southern africa and that one of these ancestral lineages persisted in the drier savanna regions . the sister lineage diverged into several arid-adapted lineages mostly centred on the savanna and nama-karoo biomes  while the remaining lineages adapted to more mesic habitats . the origin and affinities of lineage f, recorded from mesic grasslands of the great escarpment, remain unresolved.

the extant distributions of some of the lineages remain puzzling. for example, the presence of lineage e at bergville, kwazulu-natal province  and dwesa nature reserve, eastern cape province  may be a result of recent kalahari sand flows from north to south  <cit> . pleistocene sand deposits have been recorded from the eastern cape province above the great escarpment at an altitude of  <dig>  <dig> m   <cit> . other sand sheets have been reported from the western free state, gauteng and northern cape provinces  <cit> . as a species' habitat expands or shifts, so does the distributional range of that species  <cit> . this may also be the case with the occurrence of lineage d at kasane  in botswana. some studies  <cit>  have suggested incomplete mtdna lineage sorting and the retention of ancestral polymorphisms as possible explanations.

habitat changes likely also played a key role in shaping the phylogeographic structuring within lineages. radiation within lineages did not occur at the same time and it is clear from figures  <dig> and  <dig> that different processes have contributed to the levels of diversity within lineages. as has been reported for other african mammals  <cit>  different refugia may have existed in unfavourable climatic conditions and acted as sources for subsequent range expansions. the typical population cycles within m. namaquensis  <cit>  and meta-population dynamics would further have contributed to episodes of extinction and recolonisation.

lineage a serves as an example of one of the lineages with deep phylogeographic subdivision dating to the mid-pleistocene . the population history within lineage a <dig> has been more complex, potentially due to waves of colonisation or dispersal among regions associated with the expansion of grassland and savanna habitats. it is possible that large population sizes of lineage a <dig> are responsible for maintaining both the high nucleotide diversity  and the divergent alleles. six alleles were shared between localities and the presence of several unique alleles within localities may reflect evolutionarily old populations, which may have served as core regions for colonisation.

it has been proposed that grassland expanded during the glacial periods due to a colder climate that allowed for the formation of frost  <cit> . if the association between grassland and winter frost, together with the added effects of fire is significant, it is plausible to suggest that when the area of winter cold expanded periodically in the past, it may have caused an expansion of grassland at the expense of other vegetation types. there is evidence from aliwal north  and florisbad  that during the last glacial maximum , grassland replaced other vegetation types  <cit> . the genus lepus is a recent arrival in southern africa associated with the expansion of grassland over the past million years. subsequent habitat changes have for example, generated distinct scrub hare, l. saxatilis phylogroups in the central and northern regions of south africa  <cit> . it would be instructive to compare the observed pattern of m. namaquensis in the grassland to other co-distributed small mammal species, as congruence in phylogeographic patterns between independent lineages would reflect similar vicariant events  <cit> .

at the other extreme, a star-like pattern of closely related alleles is evident in lineage d, despite large geographic distances between localities . rare alleles are more likely to be mutational derivations of the common alleles  <cit> . therefore, the presence of the closely related alleles within almost all localities within lineage d reflects a common female ancestry, probably due to recent range expansion from a source population. in essence, lineage d exhibits limited phylogeographic structure with a relatively low nucleotide diversity . similar patterns of low genetic structuring have been recorded for other small mammals  <cit> . therefore, different evolutionary processes have been involved shapping genetic diversity within the different lineages.

CONCLUSIONS
micaelamys namaquensis displays considerable mtdna diversity in contrast with the current taxonomic view based on morphology/morphometrics. taken together with previously reported geographic variation in fur colour, tail length and body size we believe that the taxon represents a species complex in southern africa. given the strong geographic association of most of the eight identified lineages with specific biomes or bioregions our future research will explore processes underlying ecological speciation in the group.
