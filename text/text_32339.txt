BACKGROUND
the greater than  <dig>  extant angiosperm species are a consequence of diversification that has driven adaptation to virtually all terrestrial ecosystems  <cit> . these include many with a wide range of challenging climatic zones compared with those in which we grow our major crop species. challenging environments include those that have extremes of temperature, low and erratic precipitation and daily flooding with seawater  <cit> . such zones have a low diversity of plant species as a consequence of the extensive adaptations required for successful growth and reproduction in such environments  <cit> – <cit> . in these conditions, speciation is driven more by climate and other abiotic factors than by competition with other plant species  <cit> .

arid zones , have a range of climatic and meteorological features which impact on the vegetation  <cit> . this ranges from rocky plateaux that permit the growth of only shallow rooted annuals and mesophyte ephemerals to dry river bed wadis that can support deep rooted perennials  <cit> – <cit> . the study of perennial plants adapted to function for extended periods in arid environments could provide rewarding insights to help develop novel traits and genes for crop improvement in the face of abiotic factors such as heat, high light intensities, salinity and low nutrient and water availability  <cit> . studies of such plants in their natural extreme environment are a contrast to the many laboratory-based experiments that focus on a single stress  <cit> .

the advent of massively parallel dna sequencing technologies and allied developments in bioinformatics has brought genome-scale studies of orphan plant species within the range of many laboratories  <cit> . several plant species adapted to extreme environments have been subjected to such investigations. for example, genome sequencing of thellungiella parvula, a species adapted to a saline and resource poor environment  <cit> ; transcriptome analysis of the resurrection plant, craterostigma plantagineum, for dessication tolerance  <cit> ; a comparative survey of the transcriptome of two mangrove species, rhizophora mangle and heritiera littoralis <cit>  for multiple abiotic stresses and populus euphratica a desert tree adapted to drought and salinity  <cit> . a feature of many of these species is that their adaptations are extensive, such as recovery from desiccation in resurrection plants and the morphological and biochemical developments associated with crassulacean acid metabolism  photosynthesis  <cit> – <cit> . while such features are intrinsically worthy of study, such adaptations do not lend themselves readily to transfer to crop plants because the control of the underlying genes that determine these processes remain unknown.

in this study, we report an initial survey of the transcriptome of the perennial desert plant species rhazya stricta decne growing in its natural environment. r. stricta is a glabrous erect perennial evergreen shrub approximately 90 cm high with dense semi-erect branches  <cit>  . it is native to south asia and the middle east and belongs to the family apocynacae , which includes species of medicinal value  <cit> . r. stricta is common in arid zones at elevations of 100-700 m above sea level  <cit>  and has been found to have improved growth in wadis  <cit> , suggesting a deep root system, like other arid zone perennial species  <cit> . it is able to tolerate a wide range of soil mineral salt compositions by accumulating na+, k+, ca2+ and cl- in its leaves  <cit> .

our reason for studying the transcriptome of r. stricta is that it has a typical c <dig> photosynthetic physiology, which is able to function well under typical desert conditions of very high light intensities, temperatures and vapor pressure deficits  <cit> . the analysis of gene expression patterns may reveal mechanisms associated with stress tolerance and protection of the photosynthetic apparatus. this would identify adaptations that contribute to the success of r. stricta in its arid environment and may be worthy of future study and transfer to c <dig> crop species. this paper reports our initial survey and interpretation of changes in the patterns of global gene expression at three periods of the day and a comparison of these responses with published studies on transcriptome responses to stress in a range of plant species.

RESULTS
physiology
figure 1a-d illustrates the diurnal changes in photosynthesis assimilation rate , stomatal conductance , internal co <dig> concentration  and transpiration rate  at three measurement periods: morning, midday and dusk. also shown  is the leaf temperature and vapour pressure deficit . gs was greatest in the morning, and showed a midday depression which was maintained throughout the rest of the day . a followed the diurnal pattern of irradiance , with the highest values obtained at midday . ci was greatly reduced during this period of high assimilation and low gs suggesting that stomatal control of co <dig> uptake limited a. it is noteworthy that e did not mirror gs . this was most likely due to the 18°c increase in leaf temperature and vpd increase to  <dig> kpa observed between morning and midday .

de novo transcriptome reconstruction and annotation
the de novo transcriptome assembly produced  <dig> unique transcript sequences with a mean length of 1643 bp and n <dig> 2199 bp .  <dig> sequences were uploaded to transcriptome shotgun assembly  accession gamw <dig>  according to tsa criteria; the full list is available upon request. we were able to assign a functional description and gene ontology to  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the contigs, respectively . the annotations are provided in additional file  <dig> and the mean count per million  per leaf at each time in additional file  <dig>  and fdr significance results for  <dig> quantifiable genes.

rna-seq
to calculate expression, all reads were mapped against the de novo reconstructed transcriptome. to estimate the variation both between and within plants the biological coefficient of variation  was calculated . the results show the bcv within plants was low , but the bcv between plants was relatively greater. the latter is likely due to the inclusion of four plants, sampled over a four hour time frame. the next step was to use multivariate analysis to determine how well the gene expression profiles distinguished between the sampling time points and factors. this was done using a multi dimension scaling plot . the plot could clearly be divided into six groups which fitted the time and leaf type sampling factors. the number of quantifiable transcripts  was  <dig>  of these,  <dig> genes were significantly differentially expressed in at least one pairwise comparison.

factors; a1- <dig>  eq1- <dig>  f1- <dig>  g1- <dig>  h1- <dig>  l1- <dig> shows bcv within plants when leaf type is taken as a factor. “all” is the same, but all plants and leaf types are considered as factors. for “midday” this includes only midday samples  and uses leaf type as a factor. for “nested”, all factors except plant, but leaf type is nested within time.

quantitative pcr validation
seven genes were validated using qpcr, the results were quantitatively similar to the rna-seq data . also the results were validated using mature leaf material collected from the following year . the data from the  <dig> samples were consistent between rna-seq and previous qpcr estimates of gene expression from the  <dig> samples.

gene ontology analysis
from the go analysis  two trends were observed over the time course of the sampling. first, go biological processes that increased throughout the day and then decreased from dusk to morning , included cell wall biogenesis , pigment accumulation , uv response  and cell development . in contrast response to stress  and secondary metabolic process  decreased morning to dusk. in the morning time point, go terms relating to plastid localization  and cellular homeostasis  were over expressed . as well as the trends described above, there were multiple signaling go terms recruited throughout the day including protein phosphorylation, rna modification , dna packaging , hormone transport  and ion transport .

comparison with arabidopsis microarray data
on a daily basis, r. stricta is exposed to a number of extreme abiotic challenges . the samples collected in this study represent a limited diel sampling which could include genes associated with responses to abiotic stress in other species. to test this proposition, a comparison was carried out of the r. stricta de gene sets with microarray data from the response of the transcriptome of arabidopsis subjected to several single and combined abiotic stresses  <cit> . for the comparisons of de genes at the different sampling times and between apical and mature leaves, homologous genes between r. stricta and arabidopsis were identified and the significance of the intersection of these datasets was calculated. the majority of abiotic stress comparisons were highly significant . however, we reasoned instead that since r. stricta is adapted to these extreme conditions , then the apparent significance of this comparison might be misleading. therefore, a comparison was made between r. stricta de gene sets and those identified from a circadian regulated gene meta-analysis in arabidopsis  <cit> . assuming that r. stricta is adapted to its harsh habitat then many stress-associated genes could be differentially expressed because they were circadian regulated and not because they were responding to stressful environmental conditions. this is because circadian rhythm would not be disrupted in r. stricta leaves if it is acclimated to these extreme conditions. the results shown in table  <dig>  show approximately 29-34% of r. stricta de genes are homologs to circadian regulated genes in arabidopsis  and at all time points the comparisons were highly significant . when all circadian regulated genes were removed from the comparisons, the number of significant overlaps reduced, especially in apical leaves . in mature leaves, overlaps only with heat, high light + salt and high light + heat arabidopsis datasets were highly significant . the genes identified with significant overlap are shown in additional file  <dig>  in the heat stress comparisons, midday to dusk de genes encoding several small heat shock proteins and wrky transcription factors  were evident. the morning to midday de gene set overlapping with heat stress responsive genes included developmental homologs to gigantea and no pollen germination related <dig>  for the salt + high light from morning to midday a number of homologs to arabidopsis genes encoding transporter proteins were found . in the high light + heat, midday to dusk, four homologs to xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases were found, which are involved in cell wall modification.

hormone synthesis
to investigate enzymes of hormone metabolism, the program mapman was used and the results for mature leaves are shown in figure  <dig>  from which, three trends in the data were observed. first, the expression of genes encoding abscisic acid  biosynthesis enzymes increased from morning to midday, and then fell. the abundance of transcripts coding for nced and zep peaked at midday. nced and zep catalyse important reactions in the aba biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . in contrast, most other de genes encoding hormone metabolism decreased their abundance from morning to midday and then increased over the day. a closer inspection of the expression of de genes encoding enzymes of hormone biosynthesis was conducted . transcripts encoding two isoforms of acc synthase and one acc oxidase respectively, which are determinants of ethylene synthesis  <cit>  were the inverse of the expression pattern of aba synthesis genes . transcripts coding for aos, aoc and opr <dig>  key enzymes of jasmonic acid  biosynthesis  <cit>  were found. both aos and aoc transcripts showed a decrease in abundance from morning through the day, and opr <dig> transcript abundance rose over the same period. the isochorismate pathway synthesises salicylic acid in chloroplasts  <cit> . annotation revealed two genes encoding ics genes whose transcript abundance increased from morning to dusk and thus differed in their pattern of expression compared with other hormone biosynthesis genes .

transcription factors
mapman analysis was again used to investigate tf gene families. this was done by identification of wilcoxon rank sum test enriched bin codes. the results are shown in figure  <dig> for six significant families . the results were divided into three groups based on differential expression patterns of their genes. the basic helix loop helix , homeobox domain  and myb tfs and ap2-erebp gene families were found to significantly decrease in expression from morning to midday . these large families are involved in a wide range of processes such as developmental and stress responses  <cit> – <cit> . the second group is the wrky tf gene family members which are typically associated with responses to biotic stress but also to abiotic stress  <cit> – <cit> . this tf gene family showed a very strong decrease from morning and then a strong increase of all members between midday and dusk . third, the arabidopsis response regulators  tf gene family  <cit>  showed the opposite expression profile to the wrky tf gene family, increasing expression from morning to midday and then a strong decrease from midday to dusk .

the apelta <dig>  tf family is large with many sub-groups  which were represented among the de genes . two genes encoding homologs of rap <dig>  were found  which is an oxygen sensing tf  <cit> . the expression of both genes decreased during the day . similarly genes encoding two homologs of rap <dig>  were found  and their transcript abundance decreased from morning to dusk . both genes in arabidopsis are down-regulated by high light  <cit> . genes for members of the cytokinin response factor  tf families were found to be differentially expressed. two crf <dig> homologs  decreased at midday. like the gene coding for crf <dig>  a dreb <dig> gene homolog was found to increase expression over midday. this class of dreb is associated with osmotic stress  <cit> .

the group annotated as genes encoding “pseudo” arrs by mapman was expanded to look at other circadian clock tf genes. two homologs coding for prr <dig> and prr <dig>  were found  and all showed a similar trend in differential expression, with peak expression at midday. this was shown for prr <dig> in arabidopsis although prr <dig> showed peak expression in the morning  <cit> . the expression of two other well-characterised circadian clock genes were also investigated toc <dig>  and cca <dig>  the expression profile of these two genes is the same as that found in arabidopsis   <cit> .

overlap with transcriptomic datasets from p. euphratica and c. plantagineum
comparison of de genes from p. euphratica <cit>  and c. plantagineum showed highly significant similarity  with those from r. stricta . prominent groups of genes uncovered in common with all three datasets were those encoding cysteine proteases, rubisco activase, chlorophyll ab binding proteins and galactinol synthase isoforms. cysteine proteases are expressed in response to abiotic and biotic stress and during senescence  <cit> . rubisco activase has been found to release inhibitory sugar phosphates from rubisco and acts as a chaperone with thylakoid-bound ribosomes under heat stress  <cit> . galactinol synthase, an enzyme of raffinose biosynthesis is involved in protection against heat stress  <cit> . specifically to de genes in common with the p. euphratica dataset , a plastid terminal oxidase  gene was found to be differentially expressed. ptox is involved in electron transfer from linear photosynthetic electron transport to o <dig> and thus may contribute to the dissipation of excitation energy and protection against high light and heat stress  <cit> .

orthologous and novel proteins
for comparison of orthologous protein families with other eudicots we identified protein sequences based on blast results  <cit> . we used orthomcl  <cit>  to find orthologous groups of proteins between other eudicot species. orthomcl clusters protein families by first identifying within-species paralogs, based on blast score, and then identifies between species orthologus proteins by weighting for within-species paralog similarities. for comparison we used arabidopsis and two genome sequenced asterid species, tomato and potato . although these two species are closely related we reasoned that they represent a comprehensive resource of asterid proteins and their combined usage would increase our confidence in identifying asteraceae-specific proteins and r. stricta specific proteins. the results in figure  <dig> show there are  <dig> protein families found in all three asteraceae species and  <dig> protein families found uniquely in the solanaceae species. however the majority of protein families  are common to all species and large majority of protein families are shared between species. but the results do show that there are  <dig> protein families  unique to r. stricta, which is similar to that of the other species . we then used the r. stricta specific protein families to identify novel genes which may be attributable to its adaptation. of the  <dig> proteins, we extracted only those with an assigned go function, since the ‘unknowns’ offered little further information. this reduced the number of proteins to  <dig>  hierarchical clustering was then used to identify proteins which were differentially expressed, from this we divided the data into six clusters, shown in figure  <dig>  cluster  <dig> is associated with genes which are over-expressed at midday in both leaf types. we chose this expression pattern as it suggests that these genes may be involved in response to the increased temperature, vpd and light intensity at this time of the day. in this cluster we identified genes coding for  <dig> proteins which are shown in table  <dig>  these include a rad <dig> homolog . in arabidopsis rad <dig> directs ubiquitinated proteins to the 26s proteasome for degradation  <cit> . mutants defective in rad <dig> have lethal phenotypes and this protein is involved in cell division  <cit> . also a gene coding for a geranylgeranylated protein atgp <dig>  was identified. three genes encoding protein kinases  and a ubiquitin protein gene  were also identified. additionally a homolog to at3g <dig> , which codes for part of the mitochondrial respiratory complex  <cit>  was identified which might, along with r.stricta. <dig>  a gene coding for a component of respiratory chain electron transfer, may suggest that r. stricta has specific adaptations to mitochondrial respiration.

the table shows the r. stricta id and description, with the corresponding homolog id in either arabidopsis or uniprot.

discussion
here we present the transcriptome profile of r. stricta quantified by rna-seq. the transcriptome reconstruction produced  <dig> transcripts  which is similar to the number of genes found in other diploid plant species. for example, cucumis sativus has ~ <dig>  genes  <cit>  cannabis sativa ~ <dig>   <cit>  and arabidopsis ~ <dig>   <cit> . the average contig length  suggests the vast majority are full length transcripts since the corresponding values of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bases for c.sativus, c.sativa and arabidopsis respectively are of a similar size  <cit> – <cit> . in substantiation of the integrity of this assembly, annotation assigned a function to 80% of the contigs . also a strong overlap with the sequenced genomes of other eudicot species was found .

the bcv was found to be 19% within samples and 29% between sampling factors . typically, laboratory based rna-seq experiments on arabidopsis report bcvs of ~26%  <cit> . in general, we interpret this degree of variation in the data, comparable to plants in controlled environments, as reflecting the stability of the environment that r. stricta inhabits for long periods of time. the largest source of variation was the ‘midday’ samples . at the outset of our field campaign in september  <dig> it was known that vpd, temperature and humidity changed rapidly and reached a maximum  <dig> hours after dawn and stayed at this plateau for at least  <dig> hours . this view on the predictability of r. stricta’s environment was reinforced by the same gene expression profiles being observed  <dig> months later in  <dig> . this explains why the multivariate statistics was able to clearly assign rna-seq data to specific sampling times and development state .

we found significant overlap between arabidopsis circadian clock- regulated genes and their de homologs in r. stricta in every pairwise time comparison . in arabidopsis, 30% of expressed genes are circadian regulated  <cit> . in r. stricta, 29-34% of all de genes appear circadian regulated based on homologies to arabidopsis genes regulated by the clock . we are not in a position with r. stricta to test if the many homologs to arabidopsis circadian-regulated genes are subject to this and/or a diel-regulated cue. however, in support of the argument here, we identified homologs of classic clock regulatory genes coding for toc <dig>  cca <dig> and prrs which showed an expression profile  consistent with their arabidopsis counterparts  <cit> . moreover, many of the myb and bhlh tf genes that were significantly differentially expressed in r. stricta  over a diel are implicated in circadian regulation in arabidopsis  <cit> .

as with other species  <cit> , there is a clear adaptive advantage to r. stricta in placing many genes under circadian control. in the predictable environment r. stricta grows in, circadian- or diel-regulated processes can govern the timing of the appearance of expression of large groups of genes, while still remaining potentially responsive to unexpected environmental cues that could occur. this can allow anticipation of regular if extreme changes in the environment by the clock, modulating gene expression and restricting inappropriate responses, thus conferring a fitness benefit  <cit> – <cit> . this reconfiguration of stress-responsive gene expression in advance of changes in the environment may be an adaptive feature of all plant species, even when growing in controlled environments  <cit> . for example, transcriptome profiling of drought-stressed arabidopsis plants revealed only 10% of genes were differentially expressed as a consequence of stress imposition, the rest were circadian regulated  <cit> .

we found increasing expression of nced and zep genes  which may drive changes in aba content during the day consistent with the observed patterns of stomatal closure . in addition in arabidopsis, foliar aba levels and signaling influence responses to high light as well as relative humidity  <cit> . also we have seen no evidence for the significant differential expression of drought-responsive genes. therefore it is unlikely that changes in the expression of nced and zep genes  reflect a response to severe water deficit. aba levels have been shown to be regulated by the circadian clock, as is the expression of aba-responsive genes  <cit>  suggesting that the expression of genes coding for aba metabolism and action in r. stricta is part of a daily cycle and not a stress response. interestingly, the genes coding for enzymes involved in cytokinin and ethylene metabolism in arabidopsis are not circadian regulated  <cit>  and yet show very clear patterns of differential expression over the diel . however again, from studies in arabidopsis, the expression of these genes in r. stricta could be linked to changes in aba metabolism. for example, cytokinin action has been shown to be mutually regulated with aba in response to stress  <cit> . conversely, the expression of genes of ethylene synthesis enzymes is the inverse of those involved in aba biosynthesis  <cit> . the activity of salicylic acid signaling can negatively correlate with aba signaling in arabidopsis when subject to pathogen infection  <cit> . however in r. stricta, the expression of ics genes increased throughout the day and peaked at dusk . while classically associated with signaling to control resistance to biotrophic pathogens, salicylic acid is also important in eliciting thermotolerance  <cit>  and decreasing susceptibility to photoinhibition induced by high light  <cit> – <cit> , a role for salicylic acid of perhaps greater relevance in r. stricta.

the above considerations comparing r. stricta with arabidopsis prompt the question ‘do the daily changes in the transcriptome of r. stricta, reflect any stress response?’. stress is defined as environmental conditions that reduce growth and yield below optimum levels  <cit> . it can be assumed that r. stricta is well adapted to its environment and the conditions it is normally exposed to, while extreme , are a daily occurrence that fall within its tolerance range. therefore, the large changes in the expression of many genes that were observed here are most likely not an exceptional response to stress, but part of the daily pattern for this plant. in summary, the large repertoire of de genes over the day, annotated as stress-responsive or stress-defensive and which in temperate crops would indicate detrimental conditions, are for this species part of its routine diurnal cycle.

despite the apparent predominance of circadian control of the r. stricta transcriptome, 66-71% of de genes involved in responses to heat stress and salinity stress do not have circadian regulated homologs in arabidopsis . this could mean again that r. stricta differs from arabidopsis and has brought these genes under circadian control. however, it may equally not be advantageous to have these genes regulated in this way. heat stress responses may not be dictated entirely by the external environment but also by the internal leaf environment. the closure and opening of stomata in r. stricta may occur more frequently throughout the day  <cit> . consequently, leaf internal temperature would fluctuate caused by changing evapo-transpiration. furthermore, accompanying restrictions in photosynthesis leading to temporary increases in reactive oxygen species  <cit>  may trigger changes in the expression of genes usually associated with heat stress. heat shock protein and heat shock transcription factor gene expression is induced by ros such as hydrogen peroxide  in arabidopsis and other species  <cit> – <cit>  and this may be the case in r. stricta. the potentially variable interactions between leaf internal temperature and ros content may make it particularly important that such genes do not come under circadian control in this species.

leaves of r. stricta have genes coding for components of non-photochemical quenching  such as the enzymes of the xanthophyll cycle  <cit>   and a homolog of psbs . however, npq alone does not provide complete capacity to dissipate excess excitation energy under the types of high light conditions encountered by r. stricta. r. stricta photosynthesis is very resistant to photoinhibition, even at peak ppfds  <cit> . to dissipate excess excitation energy under these conditions requires photochemical quenching processes  <cit> . the most prominent of these processes in r. stricta is photorespiration  <cit>  and in support of this, the expression of many of the genes encoding enzymes of the photorespiratory cycle can be recognised . allied to this are a set of genes coding for enzymes of antioxidant and ros metabolism  and other enzymes and pathways that may play roles in photochemical quenching, such as the malate:oxaloacetate cycle  and ptox. most of the genes discussed here were not differentially expressed  and there is no means of assessing whether expression of the protective mechanisms in r. stricta are more highly expressed than in other plant species. nevertheless, the clear presence of all these protective processes underscores their importance to r. stricta.

the identification of salinity-induced gene homologs in the de gene set  may indicate that at the bahrah site, the plants were tapping groundwater with a high mineral content like p. euphratica <cit> . however, groundwater in wadis is susceptible to changes in flow rate as a consequence of localized rainfall elsewhere in their catchment  <cit> . therefore, changes in the mineral content of the groundwater supply to r. stricta may be variable, requiring a more flexible response independent of circadian regulation. this argument suggests that r. stricta experiences conditions in its natural environment reminiscent of those faced by irrigated crop plants. irrigation does expose plants to water of varying mineral content and responses to salinity are important for crops in this type of agriculture  <cit> . the group of salinity-responsive genes identified in r. stricta may be worthy of more study in this context.

a considerable number of the de genes in r. stricta may reflect more specialised adaptations to its desert environment. highly significant overlaps were detected of r. stricta de genes with smaller sized datasets from p. euphratica and c. plantigineum . overlapping of all datasets revealed a set of genes common to these three distantly related species , which may reflect common challenges posed by their arid habitats. in particular de genes coding for senescence-associated multiple cysteine proteinase isoforms  <cit>  were detected in all three species. however, their expression is also responsive to a range of environmental stresses in other species  <cit> . cysteine proteases are most likely to be involved in degradation of misfolded proteins, to maintain protein turnover under stress conditions  <cit> . also in common were altered expression of rubisco activase  and raffinose synthesis genes , which have both been found to have protective properties for high temperatures  <cit> – <cit> .

we identified a group of r. stricta-specific protein families  and then used the expression profiles of their genes to identify those that were over-expressed in the middle of the day . the rationale was to identify genes responsive to the increased temperature, light intensities and vpd at midday. although we focused on this group, the other r. stricta specific-protein families without annotation detail and whose genes were not differentially expressed, may also include among them genes which are important for the adaptation of r.stricta to its environment. this is because these genes must have diversified and duplicated to give rise to a protein family, suggesting an evolutionary advantage. but given the large number of genes identified in this way, it is difficult to speculate on their function and such work is beyond the scope of this research. however of those genes that were differentially expressed, we did identify genes associated with photosynthesis and respiration. work here and by lawson et al., <cit>  has highlighted the resilience of this species’ photosynthesis in this harsh environment. complementary to this, our analysis may also indicate that modifications to respiration may be part of r.stricta’s adaptation of its primary metabolism. while there are several other genes worthy of comment , one very interesting gene is that encoding rad <dig> the involvement of arabidopsis rad <dig> in the cell cycle  <cit>  perhaps suggests that this more diversified protein family in r. stricta could be linked to a broader adaptive trait. in particular we see a significant enrichment of developmental go terms  from the midday onwards. therefore the apparent modulation of cell cycle and developmental genes in mature leaves could be part of a novel adaptive mechanism in r. stricta. however the work reported here is a transcriptomics study of a species in its natural environment and which, to our knowledge, has not been grown in the laboratory. therefore, this and other potential novel adaptations in r. stricta await further technical developments to confirm the bioinformatic analyses reported here.

CONCLUSIONS
the development of crop genotypes able to withstand greater climate change will require new sources of genetic variation. one source of such variation could be novel alleles in plant species adapted to more extreme environments. r. stricta is a perennial species dominant in its hot arid environment and yet displays a photosynthetic physiology typical of many major crop species  <cit> . as with all orphan species, identifying genes from r. stricta important for adaptation to its environment poses challenges in annotating novel genes and alleles. moreover, recent studies on arabidopsis has shown that determining the temporal pattern of stress responses is critical for distinguishing between genes subject to circadian or diurnal regulation and those responsive to the imposed stress  <cit> . therefore, we determined the expression, over a diel, of the r. stricta foliar transcriptome in situ from field samples. we used these comprehensive datasets to evaluate the significance of stress-responsive mechanisms for the adaptation of this species. from early morning to dusk, changes in the transcriptome of r. stricta were extensive, 55% of  <dig> quantifiable genes being differentially expressed. the results were highly reproducible with selected genes showing the same expression patterns  <dig> months later. these data highlight the potential of rna-seq to investigate orphan plant species in situ with high precision. we found significant  overlap between all pairwise comparisons of de genes in r. stricta and arabidopsis circadian regulated genes  <cit> . the many genes annotated as stress-responsive from laboratory studies are, in r. stricta, most likely to be subject to circadian regulation and represent a major adaptation to its predictable, if harsh, environment. of the genes classified as not subject to circadian regulation, significant overlap were found of their expression profiles with genes from arabidopsis responsive to salinity or combined heat and high light stress. this may reflect more unpredictable changes in the mineral content of groundwater and internal leaf temperature fluctuations. a comparison with more limited datasets from other arid zone species has identified several groups of genes commonly prominent to them all. finally, we have identified genes which may represent adaptations not hitherto associated with improved tolerance to abiotic stress. thus our comparative analyses and extensive temporal rna-seq datasets have identified groups of genes for future study by the plant science community. moreover this study reinforces that temporal profiling of global gene expression patterns is essential to identify potential stress-adaptive processes in plants.
