BACKGROUND
duchenne muscular dystrophy  is a progressive and fatal muscle wasting disease, which occurs in  <dig> of  <dig> male births worldwide  <cit> . dmd and related animal models such as that of the mdx mouse  <cit>  are caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene that result in absence of the largest dystrophin isoform  from skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles, and the cns  <cit> . while studies on whole animal and cell culture models of dystrophin deficiency have allowed significant progress in unraveling the molecular pathology underlying dmd, the precise pathophysiology remains poorly understood  <cit> . the cytoskeletal dystrophin protein exhibits complex interactions with many other structural and signalling molecules at the muscle sarcolemma, and its absence is associated with a diverse range of molecular and cellular disturbances  <cit> . for instance, alongside the absence of dystrophin, the stability and cellular localisation of many other proteins - the so called dystrophin associated proteins  - are perturbed. these findings all suggest a complex primary and secondary pathophysiology associated with dystrophin deficiency.

transcriptomic studies of diseased versus normal muscles could be very informative for understanding dmd pathophysiology. a number of groups have noted differences in the gene expression patterns between dystrophic muscle tissues of dmd patients and those of dystrophin-proficient individuals, or mdx compared to c57bl/ <dig>  mice  <cit> . however, studies of the direct and primary molecular sequelae of dystrophin deficiency in intact animals and tissues are complicated by secondary pathologies resulting from degenerative, regenerative, fibrotic and inflammatory changes. cellular models of dystrophin deficiency can be complicated by non-clonal comparisons of cell lines, or by heterogeneous cellular composition  when comparing deficient and control primary cultures. the optimum cellular model with which to evaluate the direct and primary molecular events associated with dystrophin deficiency involves a system in which expression of the protein can be manipulated experimentally in a cell autonomous manner.

rna interference  technology allows expression of a single gene transcript and protein product to be efficiently and specifically reduced or knocked down at the mrna level  <cit> . this technique provides the opportunity to study these effects under controllable conditions, and is especially useful for multifunctional proteins such as dystrophin.

here, we describe the specific and immediate effect of dystrophin deficiency on global gene transcription in primary muscle cell cultures in which dystrophin had efficiently been knocked down by rnai. this approach provided the opportunity to compare the transcriptomes in dystrophin-deficient primary myotube cultures to that of their corresponding clonal cell populations, avoiding the heterogeneity routinely associated with primary cell cultures and tissue biopsies. our results suggest that in striated myofibers, dystrophin is mainly required for proper development and organization of the contractile unit, implicating a novel pathophysiology for dmd. genes associated with ion channels, metabolic pathways and kinases were also dysregulated in response to dystrophin deficiency. abnormal expression of certain genes detected in our model could potentially explain conditions and endophenotypes associated with dystrophin deficiency, such as dysregulation of calcium homeostasis or cardiomyopathy.

RESULTS
transcriptome of dystrophin-deficient myotubes
we previously reported potent and specific knockdown of dystrophin using four different small interferring rnas   <cit> . here, we used the most effective sirna  to knock down dystrophin in myotubes prepared from c57bl <dig> mice limb muscles. briefly, sirna transfections were performed at  <dig> nm on days two and four post-seeding and cells were collected on day six post-seeding, forty-eight hours after induction of differentiation . figure  <dig> shows a western blot analysis of dystrophin expression in myotubes used for transcriptomic studies. this experiment showed close to zero expression of dystrophin in myotubes treated with the d <dig> sirna, while this protein was well expressed both in myotubes treated with an sirna targeting firefly gl <dig> luciferase  and in untreated myotubes. no detectable change in myotube morphology was observed under phase-contrast microscopy, but immunostaining revealed an almost complete lack of dystrophin in d <dig> sirna-treated myotubes . in order to perform the transcriptomic analysis, we generated  <dig> biological replicates of primary myoblasts treated with the sirna targeting dystrophin ,  <dig> biological replicates of primary myoblasts treated with the sirna targeting luciferase , and  <dig> replicates of untreated primary myoblasts . the biological replicates were prepared and processed on  <dig> separate occasions, hence acting as independent replicates, too.

we used illumina gene expression arrays  to evaluate the myotubes under investigation, and analysed the data to determine the differentially expressed genes . we made two statistical comparisons: 1) global gene expression in myotubes knocked down for dystrophin compared to the untreated myotubes ; and 2) global gene expression in firefly gl <dig> sirna-treated myotubes compared to the untreated myotubes . by removing from list  <dig> the genes in common between lists  <dig> and  <dig>  we created a main list of genes changed specifically by dystrophin knockdown . then we made a final list of dysregulated genes by compiling those from the main list that changed by more than  <dig>  fold  p values less than  <dig> ) , and those that changed in both comparisons but in different directions . to confirm the array data, we performed rt-qpcr on six of the dysregulated genes. as demonstrated in figure  <dig>  rt-qpcr confirmed gene expression changes and corroborated the array data.

many genes of interest with respect to skeletal muscle function or the dmd phenotype can be identified amongst the dysregulated genes displayed in additional file  <dig>  at first glance, several genes that have been associated with various myopathies are recognised amongst the differentially regulated genes. these include kyphoscoliosis peptidase   <cit> , cofilin  <dig>   <cit> , calpain  <dig>   <cit> , titin-cap   <cit>  and phosphofructokinase   <cit>  .

this table details genes from additional file  <dig> that were cited in the text. table sorted by ascending adjusted p values. italicized genes are those dysregulated in dystrophin sirna treated samples versus untreated samples, but changing in the opposite direction in the gl <dig> sirna treated versus untreated samples .

with respect to the significance of change, dystrophin transcript is positioned to the top of the list of significantly changing genes, only next to ribosomal protein l3-like . 'cap-gly domain-containing linker protein family, member 4'  and parvalbumin  are two other transcripts with associated p values similar to that of dystrophin transcript.

ion channels  <cit> , metabolic pathways  <cit>  and kinases-related signaling pathways  <cit>  are affected in dystrophin-deficient muscle cells. several genes of each group were dysregulated in dystrophin-deficient myotubes in our experiment. for ion channels, scn1b is downregulated both as reported by pescatori et. al.  <cit>  and in our experiments. pescatori et. al. used muscles from children affected with dmd under the age of  <dig> - before any overt skeletal muscle pathology - when one would expect to see a transcriptome related to dystrophin deficiency without secondary complications. among metabolism associated molecules, 'muscle glycogen phosphorylase' , 'phosphorylase kinase gamma 1' , 'phosphofructokinase, muscle' , 'glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1'  were reproducibly downregulated in our experiment and as reported by the aforementioned group  <cit> . further, despite different species being studied, we found comparable results for 'cholinergic receptor, nicotinic, epsilon polypeptide' , 'cylin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a' , calpain  <dig> , lipin <dig>  and 'monoamine oxidase b' .

transcripts of several kinases were dysregulated in our model; amongst them, 'mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7' , 'mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 9'  and 'phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, catalytic, beta polypeptide'  and 'ap2-associated kinase  <dig> ' all upregulated. similarly, pi3k/akt pathway is reported to be activated in pre-necrotic  diaphragm and in myotubes from mdx mice  <cit> 

heart and brain are affected in dmd, in addition to skeletal muscles. there are several genes identified in our experiment that could potentially participate in the development of heart and brain associated endophenotypes in dmd. these genes include 'beta myosin heavy chain' , obscurin , 'heat shock protein, alpha-crystalline-related b6' , titin , titin-cap , and myospryn  for heart associated phenotypes, and 'cytoplasmic fragile x mental retardation  interacting protein 2' , 'gamma-aminobutyric acid a receptor, delta' , and 'sodium channel, voltage-gated, type i, beta'   for brain associated phenotypes.

gene ontology and ingenuity pathway analyses
in order to have a systematic view on gene categories altered by dystrophin deficiency, we used the tool provided by the database for annotation, visualisation and integrated discovery   <cit>  to conduct gene ontology  analysis on the genes listed in additional file  <dig>  as demonstrated in table  <dig>  a stringent approach to considering overrepresented go terms  indicated enrichment for genes involved in muscle contraction, such as those contributing to sarcomere and ion channels structures. furthermore, a less stringent but still significant  approach revealed overrepresentation of molecules involved in metabolic pathways and kinases .

david tool was used for this analysis. only terms with benjamini-hochberg adjusted p values <  <dig>  and fold enrichment  greater than  <dig> are displayed. table sorted by ascending adjusted p values.

we used ingenuity pathway analysis   to further investigate the networks and functions possibly affected in dystrophic muscles. among the genes in additional file  <dig>  ipa identified  <dig> network-eligible genes and suggested  <dig> main gene networks as being dysregulated by dystrophin deficiency . moreover, ipa discovered very significant enrichment  of molecules involved in muscle contraction as well as significant enrichment  of other molecules involved in muscle  functions and disorders, metabolism of carbohydrates and neurological disorders amongst differentially expressed genes in our model . ipa also indicated enrichment  of genes involved in actin cytoskeletal and calcium signaling canonical pathways .

genes listed in the additional file  <dig> were used for this analysis. only functions and disorders with benjamini-hochberg corrected p values <  <dig>  are displayed.

mirbase mirna database, release  <dig> was used for this analysis.

discussion
despite much effort toward disentangling the molecular basis of dmd pathophysiology, it remains unclear how the absence of one molecule results in a complicated phenotype such as dmd. this is partly due to the complexity of dystrophin interactions in muscle cells. as shown by others and in the present work, the absence of dystrophin starts a cascade of derangements in several networks. this results in underdeveloped muscles, prone to the adverse effects of physical stresses that add another level of molecular complexity to the disorder. to capture the most direct effect of dystrophin deficiency, one has to get as close as possible to the early myogenesis stages when dystrophin naturally starts to be expressed. having this in mind, we decided to use primary muscle cultures to study early myogenesis in the absence of dystrophin, by comparing the transcriptome of dystrophin-deficient cells to that of their normal counterparts shortly after induction of myogenesis. similar approaches have been taken by others; however, we designed this experiment to avoid the cellular heterogeneity associated with the other studies. accordingly, we used rnai to knock down dystrophin in mouse primary myotubes, and compared transcriptomes in these cells to those in the same cell population but in which dystrophin had not been targeted. we have previously shown that rnai is a robust technique for dystrophin knockdown  <cit> . here, applying dystrophin rnai to samples used for our transcriptomic studies resulted in close to zero dystrophin expression . we decided to analyze samples collected  <dig> hours after differentiation. at that time point, we did not observe any detectable change in myotube morphology or timing of fusion. we selected this early time point in order to focus on the early myogenesis events in the presence and absence of dystrophin expression, but avoid any unrelated secondary events such as myotube rupture and culture senescence. to account for possible unrelated variations, the experiment involved biological replicates prepared on four occasions . this design produced meaningful results, capable of giving mechanistic insights into the conditions and endophenotypes associated with dmd.

a systematic overview of genes listed in additional file  <dig> by go and ipa analyses indicated significant overrepresentation of genes associated with the physiology of contraction, kinases, or metabolic pathways. this indicates that dystrophin is not just a molecule providing structural support to myofibers, but its presence is crucial for proper development and function of striated muscle as a contractile unit.

other earlier studies on dystrophin deficiency support our observation that ion channels  <cit> , kinases  <cit>  and metabolic pathways  <cit>  are also affected in dystrophic muscles. here, we provide a more comprehensive view of the genes dysregulated under these categories and indicate future lines of researches to address these pathways.

dysregulated genes involved in development of skeletal muscle phenotype
clip <dig> and pvalb had associated p values similar to that of dystrophin transcript. though not much is known about clip <dig> function, pvalb is reported to be downregulated in dmd  <cit>  and mdx  <cit>  muscles. pvalb binds to ca2+ and its calcium buffering capacity is important for calcium homeostasis during muscle contraction when high level of calcium is released into the sarcoplasm. dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, with increased intracellular i is well documented in dystrophic muscles  <cit> . in line with this, calsequestrin  <dig> , the gene for casq <dig> calcium-binding protein located in sarcoplasmic reticulum , was also downregulated in our model of dystrophin deficiency. supportively, dmd muscles are reported to have deficiencies in this protein  <cit> . casq <dig> is believed to be essential for the normal development of the sr, and for calcium storage and regulation inside sr  <cit> .

kinases can initiate long range signaling activity by activating transcription factors that in turn will activate transcription of their target genes. one way for kinases to specify their local activity is by being targeted and anchored to the region where their activity is required  <cit> . a single molecule such as dystrophin could regulate the expression of a variety of myogenesis-related genes through its role in anchoring other molecules in the right locale. this property can help localise kinases and/or other signaling molecules to where their functions are required for proper myogenesis. for instance, dystrobrevin  <cit>  and synemin  <cit> , two dystrophin associated proteins  <cit> , act to localise protein kinase a . myospryn , a gene downregulated in dystrophin-deficient myotubes in our model, has binding sites for pka, anchoring it at the costamere to localise pka signaling at this complex region  <cit> . supportively, it has been documented that dystrophin deficiency results in downregulation  <cit>  and mislocalisation of myospryn in skeletal muscles, resulting in lower pka activity  <cit> . nearly two thirds of the genes dysregulated in our experiments were downregulated  indicating possible under-activity of certain myogensis-related transcription factors normally activated by kinases. in fact, dysregulation of some transcription factors in mdx skeletal muscle has already been reported  <cit> .

our results also suggest that myofiber type fate determination may be affected by dystrophin deficiency. upregulation of 'prospero-related homeobox 1'  is a key step in formation of slow muscle fibres  <cit> . our samples in which dystrophin had been downregulated showed three-fold increase in prox <dig>  additionally, 'fast type myosin binding protein c'  and 'alpha actinin3'  were downregulated in dystrophin deficient myotubes in our experiment. actn <dig> levels increase in accord with increases in skeletal muscle fast fibers  <cit> ; and specific expression of mybpc <dig> in fast fibre muscles has also been documented  <cit> .

dysregulated genes involved in development of heart phenotype
heart is another organ which is involved by the pathogenesis of dystrophin deficiency. there are several molecules identified by our model that can potentially explain the mechanism by which heart is adversely affected in dmd. for instance, obscurin, which was downregulated in our experiment, is required for proper assembly of m-band and a-band and myofibrillar clusters and for the regular alignment of the sr network around the contractile apparatus  <cit> . hspb <dig>  which associates with actin, is a cardioprotector under stressful conditions  <cit>  and its mrna was downregulated in association with dystrophin deficiency in this experiment.

z-disc and costamere and their associated molecules function as mechanosensors in striated muscles, and their perturbation can result in architectural distortion of the affected muscle cells  <cit> . hence, mutations in some genes involved in this area, such as titin and titin-cap, can result in cardiomyopathy  <cit> . titin-cap was downregulated in dystrophin-deficient myotubes in our experiment, as was myozenin  <dig>  another z-disc associated protein.

expression of the myospryn gene was downregulated by dystrophin deficiency in our model. it is also downregulated in both dmd  <cit>  and mdx  <cit> ; and single nucleotide polymorphisms at the myospryn locus are associated with ventricular hypertrophy  <cit> . this gene is expressed exclusively in heart and skeletal muscle during embryogenesis and in adult striated muscle  <cit> . interestingly, as it was mentioned earlier myospryn protein is a docking molecule for protein kinase a at the costamere, and involved in localising and specifying signal transduction at this region  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our work depicts a specific transcriptome associated with dystrophin deficiency, with minimal noise from non-specific complications such as non-clonal cells or biopsy-associated issues such as necrosis/degeneration/regeneration. while our results are affirmatively reproducing several previous in vitro and in vivo experiments, indicating the soundness of the data, they additionally suggest that dystrophin may be crucial for proper development of striated muscles as an organized contractile unit, implicating a novel pathophysiology for dmd. dysregulation of several molecules converging at functions associated with the contractile unit of the myofibers is indicative of an aberrant myogenesis process resulting in maldeveloped myofibers which may be susceptible to physical or cytotoxic stress. future experiments should include time course studies to identify longer-term sequelae of dystrophin deficiency. these data complement our previous in vivo work with dystrophin shrnas expressed from aav vectors  <cit> , which suggested that the presence of dystrophin is not as essential after striated muscles have fully developed. accordingly, transient gene therapy or other approaches to counter dystrophin-deficiency at early stages of skeletal muscle maturation might confer long lasting therapeutic benefit. in addition, the identification of dysregulated genes linked to dystrophin deficiency will provide insights and experimental approaches to define novel therapeutic targets for the potential treatment of dmd.
