BACKGROUND
although cisplatin is a widely used anticancer drug  <cit> , it has a number of side effects and a limited spectrum of activity  <cit> . in an attempt to reduce toxicity and widen the spectrum of activity thousands of cisplatin analogues have been prepared by varying the nature of the leaving groups and the carrier ligands  <cit> . by manipulating the structure the leaving groups it has been possible to reduce toxicity  and that of the carrier ligands, it has been possible to achieve a limited change in the spectrum of activity   <cit> . in spite of the progress made, it is generally true to say that all cisplatin analogues have a similar spectrum of activity and develop cross resistance with cisplatin  <cit> .

currently attention is given to rule breaker platinum compounds with the idea that different nature of interaction with dna may translate into a different spectrum of activity. one such class of compounds are trans-planaramineplatinum complexes a number of which have been found to be quite active against both cisplatin-responsive and cisplatin-resistant cancer cell lines  <cit> . often it is found that the cis-isomers of the compounds are also active. for example, zd0d <dig> has been found to show significant antitumour activity against a number of cancer cell lines  <cit> .

in our laboratory a number of trans-planaramineplatinum complexes of the form: trans-ptcl2nh3l  have been prepared which have shown significant anticancer activity  <cit> . one of the compounds is twice as active as cisplatin against a2780cisr cell line. the variations in activity of the compounds and conformational changes induced in pbr <dig> plasmid dna illustrate structure-activity relationship. later we reported on the synthesis and activity of some cis-planaramineplatinum complexes as well  <cit> . in this paper, we report on the synthesis, binding with dna and activity of two cis-planaramineplatinum complexes of the form: cis-ptlcl <dig> where l = 3-hydroxypyridine and  <dig> -diaminopyridine . both the compounds are found to be less active than cisplatin against three ovarian cancer cell lines: a <dig>  a2780cisr and a2780zd047r.

RESULTS
characterisation
the compositions of ah <dig> and ah <dig> are given in table  <dig> 

significant difference between calculated and observed carbon contents for ah <dig> indicates that the compound contains some impurity possibly cis-bisdichloroplatinum.

molar conductivity
the limiting values of molar conductivity  at zero concentration of ah <dig> and ah <dig> were found to be  <dig> and  <dig> respectively as against  <dig> for cisplatin and  <dig> for transplatin. these values are significantly lower than the expected value of about  <dig> for a 1: <dig> electrolyte, indicating that the degree of dissociation is about 54% in the case of ah <dig> and 75% in the case of ah <dig>  the results suggest that ah <dig> may be crossing the cell membrane more readily than ah <dig> by passive diffusion. since the degree of dissociation is significant, both the molecules may be crossing the cell membrane also by carrier-mediated transport . the lower molar conductivity values of ah <dig> and ah <dig> as compared to cisplatin suggests that the degree of dissociation of the compounds is less than that for cisplatin. this is in line with the presence of a bulkier planaramine ligand in ah <dig> and ah <dig> that introduces a greater steric hindrance. it is not however clear why transplatin is found to have a lower molar conductivity value than cisplatin. it should however be noted that 1: <dig> mixture of dmf and water does not truly represent biological fluids such as extracellular and intracellular fluids where the degree of dissociation is expected to be higher because of a higher water content.

interaction with pbr <dig> plasmid dna
as pbr <dig> plasmid dna, which is found to be a mixture of mainly supercoiled form i and a small amount of singly nicked circular form ii, is interacted with increasing concentrations of ah <dig>  the mobility of both form i and form ii bands changes such that the two bands co-migrate for the concentrations of ah <dig> ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> μm above which the two bands partially separate. there is also a decrease in intensity of the bands at higher concentrations of ah <dig>  the change in mobility of the form i band is due to a change in its conformation brought about by covalent binding of ah <dig> with the dna. ah <dig> is expected to form mainly monofunctional pt-g and intrastrand bifunctional pt adducts with dna, the latter causing the bending of a dna strand mainly at the binding site. the decrease in intensity of the bands is due to dna damage brought about possibly by the stacking interaction between 3-hydroxypyridine ligand in ah <dig> and nucleobases in dna. the sharp increase in intensity of form ii band at low concentrations of ah <dig> as compared to that in untreated dna indicates the conversion of some of form i dna to form ii dna due catalyzed by ah <dig>  when pbr <dig> plasmid dna is interacted with increasing concentrations of ah <dig> also, there is an initial increase in intensity of the form ii band at low concentrations of the compound, indicating the conversion of some of form i dna to form ii dna as in the case of ah <dig>  the mobility of both forms i and ii bands appear to remain unchanged with the change in concentration of ah <dig>  the results suggest that ah <dig> is less able to cause conformational change in pbr <dig> plasmid dna than ah <dig>  it may be noted that the presence of two amine groups in  <dig> -diaminopyridine makes it slightly bulkier than 3-hydroxypyridine. as a result, steric constraint hindering access to platinum would be greater in ah <dig> than ah <dig>  as discussed earlier,  <dig> -diaminopyridine and 3-hydroxypyridine are also expected to differ in their polarity. this factor too may have some influence on the reactivity of ah <dig> and ah <dig> and their binding with dna.

bamh <dig> digestion
a mixture of forms i, ii and iii bands are observed for all concentrations of cisplatin ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> μm with forms i and ii bands being the faintest at  <dig> μm cisplatin and form iii band being the faintest at  <dig> μm cisplatin. the results indicate increasing prevention of bamh <dig> digestion with the increase in concentration of cisplatin. this is due to conformational change in the dna brought about by the covalent binding of cisplatin with the dna . a mixture of forms i, ii and iii was also observed for all concentrations of transplatin indicating that transplatin is also able to prevent bamh <dig> digestion. however, the relative intensities of the three bands suggest that transplatin is less able to prevent bamh <dig> digestion than cisplatin. like cisplatin transplatin can form monofunctional adducts but unlike cisplatin , transplatin is more likely to form interstrand bifunctional adducts. the results suggest that the formation of interstrand adducts also brings about sufficient conformational change in dna  mainly due to mismatch between interbase distance and that between the two trans arms of transplatin. the progressive decrease in intensity of the bands from lanes  <dig> to  <dig> appears to be artefact as the band applying to untreated and undigested dna  could not be seen.

cytotoxicity
the letters 's', 'm', 'w', 'd' and 'br' stand for 'strong', 'medium', 'weak', 'doublet' and 'broad' respectively.

it can be seen that both ah <dig> and ah <dig> are significantly less active than cisplatin against the cell lines: a <dig>  a2780cisr and a2780zd0473r. it should however be noted the ic <dig> value for cisplatin found in the present study for the cell line a <dig> is significantly higher than the reported value  <cit> . this difference may be the result of some problems faced in growing a <dig> cells in the present study. it is thus possible that the underestimation of activity may apply to ah <dig> and ah <dig> so that the actual ic <dig> value of ah <dig> and ah <dig> for the cell line a <dig> could be significantly lower than the value found.

the other point to note is that although ah <dig> and ah <dig> are less active than cisplatin, the change in activity of the compound in going from cisplatin-responsive cell line: a <dig> to the resistant cell lines: a2780cisr and a2780zd0473r is less marked than that for cisplatin, the results suggest that at the level of their activity the compounds have been able to overcome mechanisms of resistance operating in a2780cisr and a2780zd0473r cell lines. as stated earlier, like cisplatin ah <dig> and ah <dig> are expected to form monofunctional and intrastrand bifunctional adducts with dna. it is possible that the presence of a bulky planaramine ligand makes ah <dig> and ah <dig> much less reactive than cisplatin. also, some ah <dig> and ah <dig> molecules may simply undergo intercalation with dna or while binding covalently with nucleobases in dna may undergo stacking interaction. damage to pbr <dig> plasmid dna caused by ah <dig> and ah <dig>  may be due to intercalation.

ah <dig> is found to be more active than ah <dig> against the three cell lines. it should be recalled that molar conductivity value of ah <dig> is found to be higher than that for ah <dig>  the presence of two amino groups in  <dig> -diaminopyridine ligand make ah <dig> more ionisable than ah <dig> in which the planaramine is 3-hydroxypridine. it is possible that both the cell uptake and level of binding with dna will be for ah <dig> than ah <dig> which would explain the lower activity of ah <dig> than ah <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
two cis-planaramineplatinum complexes: cis-dichloroplatinum  and cis-dichloroplatinum  have prepared and characterised based on elemental analyses, ir, raman, mass and 1h nmr spectral measurements. the interaction of the compounds with pbr <dig> plasmid dna has been studied and the activity of the compound against ovarian cell lines: a <dig>  a2780cisr and a2780zd0473r have also been determined where cisplatin has been used as the reference. like cisplatin, ah <dig> and ah <dig> are expected to form monofunctional and intrastrand bifunctional adducts with dna, but the compounds are found to cause a weaker unwinding of supercoiled form i pbr <dig> plasmid dna and the prevention of bamh <dig> digestion. the lower activity of ah <dig> and ah <dig> as compared to cisplatin is believed to be due to their reduced ability to bind with dna because of a greater steric constraint introduced by bulkier planaramine ligands. ah <dig> is found to be more active than ah <dig> against the three cell lines. it is believed that the presence of two amino groups in  <dig> -diaminopyridine ligand make ah <dig> more ionisable than ah <dig> in which the planaramine is 3-hydroxypridine. it is possible that both the cell uptake and level of binding with dna will be for ah <dig> than ah <dig> which would explain the lower activity of ah <dig> than ah <dig>  the determination of cell uptake and the level of binding with dna would indicate whether the idea is true or not.
