BACKGROUND
valproic acid  has been used for mood stabilization and the treatment of epilepsy for several decades  <cit> . vpa also exhibits potent in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor effects in leukemic cells, neuroblastomas, and gliomas  <cit> . vpa is a histone deacetylase  inhibitor and plays a role in modifying chromatin structure and gene expression  <cit> . vpa has also been found to affect various signaling systems, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase , protein kinase c , and the wnt/β-catenin pathways  <cit> . vpa alters the wnt/β-catenin signaling by directly or indirectly  <cit>  inhibiting the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β .

vpa has been reported to regulate the differentiation and proliferation of various cells, including mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells, neuroblastoma cells, primary neurons, and neural progenitor cells   <cit> . vpa can also reduce the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells by induction of the cell cycle regulator p21cip/waf <dig>  <cit> , which is also known to be involved in the vpa-induced differentiation of hematopoietic cells  <cit> . however, the mechanism by which vpa regulates differentiation and proliferation is not understood.

we report here that  <dig> mm vpa induces differentiation and inhibits proliferation of npcs by overcoming the effect of basic fibroblast growth factor , a factor which inhibits the differentiation of npcs  <cit> . vpa-induced activation of the erk- p21cip/waf <dig> pathway did not occur via the common pathway involving epidermal growth factor receptor , an upstream component of the erk pathway, as indicated by significant reduction in the level of egfr in the presence of vpa. the level of ras protein, another upstream component of the erk pathway, was significantly increased by vpa treatment. this observation led us to conclude that vpa-induced erk pathway activation occurs via an increase in the stability of ras, mediated by wnt/β-catenin signaling  <cit> . we also found that the common ras-erk-p21cip//waf <dig> pathway is involved in generating the mutually exclusive phenotypes of differentiation and proliferation in npcs and in brain tissue of the cerebral cortex of developing embryos.

RESULTS
vpa overcomes the effects of bfgf on differentiation and proliferation in multipotent npcs
basic fibroblast growth factor  is necessary for the maintenance of multipotency in neural progenitor cells  <cit>  and is involved in the regulation of differentiation and growth in neuronal cells  <cit> . in agreement with earlier reports, we found that npcs isolated from the cerebral cortex of e <dig> rat embryos underwent morphologic differentiation when grown in n <dig> medium alone . the npcs retain the capacity for self-renewal, as shown by their ability to form neurospheres, by a process of dissociation and reformation, for several passages in culture . the npcs also retain the property of multipotency, as shown by their capacity to differentiate into primary neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes . the npcs maintained an undifferentiated morphology when grown in the presence of  <dig> ng/ml bfgf . the differentiation-suppressing and proliferative effects of bfgf were partly overcome by treatment with  <dig> mm vpa . cells treated with vpa and bfgf also exhibited more pronounced neurite outgrowth compared to cells treated with bfgf alone. the effect of vpa on morphologic differentiation in the presence of bfgf was dose-dependent . no evidence of cell toxicity was detected in the presence of  <dig> mm vpa and this concentration was used in the remaining experiments. not only do npcs grown in the presence of bfgf for  <dig> h remain morphologically undifferentiated, but the cells also had a high proliferation rate, as indicated by a five-fold increase in total cell number compared to untreated cultures . in contrast, co-treatment with  <dig> mm vpa for  <dig> h reduced cell number by 60% compared to cells treated with bfgf alone . vpa did not alter cell number in cultures grown in the absence of bfgf. therefore, vpa induced both differentiation and inhibition of proliferation in npcs by overcoming the anti-differentiation and pro-growth effects of bfgf.

vpa induces both p21cip/waf <dig> and tuj <dig> via the raf-mek-erk cascade in npcs grown in the presence of bfgf
the erk pathway is involved in both positive and negative regulations of cell growth depending upon the intensity and duration of the signals  <cit>  and vpa can activate the erk pathway in primary neurons in culture  <cit> . to investigate the potential involvement of the erk pathway in vpa-induced differentiation and growth inhibition in bfgf-treated npcs, the activation status of raf- <dig>  mek, and erk was examined. immunoblot analysis revealed that vpa treatment elicited an increase in erk activity, as indicated by an increase in the levels of phosphorylated erk , in npcs grown in bfgf. the levels of phosphorylated mek  and raf- <dig>  were also increased in npcs in which differentiation had been induced and proliferation had been inhibited by treatment with vpa . induction of the cell cycle regulator p21cip/waf <dig> is an important indicator of erk pathway-induced inhibition of proliferation  <cit> . in accordance with its anti-proliferative effect, vpa elicited an increase in p21cip/waf <dig> levels in npcs grown in the presence of bfgf . immunocytochemical analysis of npcs revealed that the induction of p21cip/waf <dig> by vpa was accompanied by accumulation of p21cip/waf <dig> in the cell nuclei . the number of cells containing positive nuclear staining of p21cip/waf <dig> increased from 5% to  <dig> % in response to vpa treatment . in contrast, the percentage of proliferating cells, which incorporated brdu into their nuclei, was reduced from 73% to 15% in response to treatment with  <dig> mm vpa . immunoblot analysis revealed that the level of tuj <dig>  a specific marker of immature neurons, increased in npcs grown in the presence of vpa and bfgf . immunocytochemical analysis confirmed these findings and also showed marked, enhanced neurite outgrowth in cells showing significantly increased levels of tuj <dig> .

to ascertain whether the erk pathway mediates p21cip/waf <dig> induction and neuronal differentiation in response to vpa, we measured the effect of inhibition of the ras-erk pathway on the induction of p21cip/waf <dig> and tuj <dig> by vpa. induction of p21cip/waf <dig> by vpa was significantly reduced when erk activation was inhibited by the mek inhibitor pd <dig> . induction of tuj <dig> by vpa was also reduced by pd <dig>  the vpa-induced activation of the erk pathway in the inhibition of growth of npcs in the presence of bfgf was confirmed by the observation of re-increase of cell numbers by treatment with pd <dig> in the presence of vpa . we did not observe any growth-stimulatory effect of pd <dig> when npcs were grown in the absence of bfgf; rather, cell number was somewhat reduced by pd <dig> treatment . in summary, vpa induces differentiation and inhibition of proliferation via the ras→mek→erk pathway in npcs grown in the presence of bfgf.

p21cip/waf <dig> mediates vpa-induced differentiation and inhibition of proliferation in npcs grown in the presence of bfgf
vpa-induced erk activation and p21cip/waf <dig> induction were not observed in the tuj1-induced, differentiated npcs grown in the absence of bfgf, as shown by both biochemical  and immunocytochemical  analyses. in these cultures, the number of brdu-positive cells was relatively low and was not changed by vpa treatment . to determine the role of p21cip/waf <dig> in vpa-induced differentiation and inhibition of proliferation, we analyzed the effect of p21cip/waf <dig> sirna. stimulation of neuronal differentiation and inhibition of proliferation in npcs by vpa treatment were diminished by p21cip/waf <dig> sirna as shown by both biochemical  and immunocytochemical  analyses. inhibition of proliferation, one of the effects of vpa on npcs as assessed by brdu incorporation, was also released after treatment with p21cip/waf <dig> sirna . the majority of cells exhibiting nuclear accumulation of p21cip/waf <dig> after vpa treatment were also brdu-negative, underscoring the important anti-proliferative role of p21cip/waf <dig> .

vpa activates the erk-p21cip/waf <dig> pathway and induces differentiation and inhibition of proliferation via β-catenin-mediated accumulation of ras in npcs grown in the presence of bfgf
the epidermal growth factor receptor  most often mediates activation of the erk pathway by extracellular stimuli  <cit> . although, in this study, the erk pathway was activated by vpa, we were surprised to find that egfr levels were reduced by vpa treatment in npcs grown in the presence of bfgf . the vpa-induced decrease in egfr levels was convincingly seen in the time course of vpa treatment after treatment with  <dig> mm vpa . vpa regulates the wnt/β-catenin pathway by direct binding and inhibition of gsk3β  <cit> . in this study, we also observed an increase in the level of phospho-ser-9-gsk <dig> , an inactive form of gsk3β  <cit> , and β-catenin following vpa treatment . it is also known that ras protein levels are subject to regulation by the wnt/β-catenin pathway in several cell types, including primary hepatocytes, and β-catenin has been identified as a mediator in that process  <cit> . here, we found that the level of ras protein was significantly up-regulated in npcs treated with vpa, leading to an increase in p-gsk3β and its target, β-catenin . the role of β-catenin in the regulation of ras was further indicated by similar patterns of increase in ras and β-catenin levels during the time course of vpa treatment .

to identify the role of β-catenin in the regulation of the ras-erk-p21cip/waf <dig> pathway and subsequent stimulation of differentiation and inhibition of proliferation induced by vpa in npcs, we measured the effect of overexpression of β-catenin. overexpression of β-catenin increased erk activity and ras protein level and induced expression of p21cip/waf <dig> and tuj <dig> . cells overexpressing β-catenin were morphologically differentiated and brdu-negative . therefore, β-catenin is an important factor for both differentiation and inhibition of proliferation in cortical e <dig> npcs and those physiological responses are simultaneously and independently controlled by β-catenin.

the role of β-catenin in the vpa-induced expression of tuj <dig> and p21cip/waf <dig> in npcs was further investigated by measurement of the effects of β-catenin sirna. we observed that the vpa-induced increase in ras was reduced following β-catenin knockdown . erk activation, and subsequent induction of tuj <dig> and p21cip/waf <dig>  was also reduced by β-catenin knockdown , indicating that β-catenin, at least in part, mediates the effect of vpa on the activation of the erk-p21cip/waf1-tuj <dig> pathway via stabilization of ras. vpa-induced reduction in egfr levels was not affected by β-catenin knockdown. the role of β-catenin in vpa-induced differentiation and inhibition of proliferation was also examined . immunocytochemical analysis revealed that β-catenin sirna significantly reduced vpa-mediated induction of tuj <dig> in npcs . in contrast, the number of brdu-positive cells, which initially decreased in the presence of vpa, was marginally increased by vpa treatment following silencing of β-catenin .

vpa independently induces differentiation and inhibition of proliferation in npcs in the developing rat brain
to understand the physiological relevance of the effects of vpa observed in vitro, we administered vpa to e <dig>  rat embryos and examined the effect on differentiation and proliferation in the cerebral cortex. in the absence of vpa, the immunofluorescent labeling patterns of proliferating cell nuclear antigen  and tuj <dig> in the cerebral cortex of the developing rat embryo were distinct and non-overlapping . in control embryos injected with pbs alone, tuj <dig> staining was predominantly localized to the cortical plate  area, where differentiated neuronal cells reside. however, pcna staining was primarily localized to the subventricular zone  and the intermediate zone , where neural stem/progenitor cells reside . the number of cells that had differentiated into neurons was significantly increased by vpa, to the extent that both the area occupied by tuj1-positive cells and the intensity of the tuj <dig> staining were significantly increased in the cp region . in contrast, the intensity and number of pcna-positive cells were significantly reduced by vpa in the svz and imz of the cerebral cortex ; of the cerebral cortical cells induced to differentiate by vpa treatment, none were pcna-positive. demonstration of differentiation and proliferation in cells of the vpa-treated cerebral cortex was also carried out in vitro, and similar distinct patterns of tuj <dig> and brdu staining were observed in the vpa-treated npcs grown in the presence of bfgf .

discussion
in the present study, we found that npcs undergo neuronal differentiation and inhibition of proliferation following treatment with  <dig> mm of the commonly prescribed antiepileptic drug vpa  <cit> . we chose  <dig> mm vpa because this concentration is non-toxic to the npcs in our current study and to hippocampal neuronal progenitors  <cit> . the vpa amount applied to the animals,  <dig> mg/kg, is identical to that used to achieve whole-brain levels of  <dig> – <dig>  mm by chronic application  <cit> .

we investigated the mechanism by which vpa regulates differentiation and inhibition of proliferation. the role of vpa in the exclusive in vivo regulation of differentiation and proliferation of npcs suggest an application for vpa in the production of functional neurons for therapeutic use in patients. our study also provides a mechanism that may aid in validating the proposed use of vpa as an anti-tumor and neuroprotective agent  <cit> . vpa induced both differentiation and inhibition of proliferation in npcs by overcoming the effect of bfgf, a factor which promotes growth/proliferation and suppresses differentiation, through the common erk-p21cip/waf <dig> pathway. the vpa-induced inhibition of proliferation was suppressed by the mek inhibitor pd <dig>  indicating a role for activation of the erk pathway in the inhibition of proliferation by vpa. participation of the erk pathway in inhibition of proliferation is frequently accompanied by induction of the cell cycle inhibitory factor p21cip/waf <dig>  <cit> ; p21cip/waf <dig> was also induced in the vpa-treated npcs. the role of p21cip/waf <dig> in inhibition of proliferation by vpa is also shown by release of the vpa-induced inhibition of proliferation by p21cip/waf <dig> sirna. the role of p21cip/waf <dig> as a potent anti-proliferation factor was further shown by loss of brdu incorporation in most cells in which p21cip/waf <dig> had been induced by vpa.

a significant decrease in the level of tuj <dig> following sirna-mediated p21cip/waf <dig> knockdown, demonstrated by both biochemical and immunocytochemical analyses, suggests that p21cip/waf <dig> may also be involved in the regulation of differentiation and inhibition of proliferation. it is clear that both inhibition of proliferation and differentiation of npcs stimulated by vpa occur through the erk pathway-dependent induction of p21cip/waf <dig> 

we have shown that activation of the erk-p21cip/waf <dig> pathway by vpa did not occur via the segment of the pathway involving egfr but via the segment involving β-catenin. although egfr has been identified as a target of wnt/β-catenin in liver  <cit> , egfr was reduced by vpa in npcs. the mechanism by which egfr transcription is inhibited by vpa is unknown; however, it has been established that egfr transcription is repressed by bone morphogenetic protein  <dig> , an alternative transcription target of β-catenin  <cit> , in npcs  <cit> . we observed significant induction of bmp <dig> in the vpa-treated npcs grown in the presence of bfgf . these data suggest that the vpa-induced decrease in egfr in npcs may be acquired through induction of bmp <dig> 

vpa directly inhibits gsk3β resulting in activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway  <cit>  and β-catenin is, in turn, involved in regulation of the erk pathway  <cit> . evidence for the role of β-catenin in vpa-induced activation of the erk-p21cip/waf <dig> pathway, and subsequent effects on differentiation and inhibition of proliferation in npcs, was seen in the reduction of the effects of vpa, including erk activation and induction of p21cip/waf <dig> and tuj <dig>  following sirna-mediated β-catenin knockdown. the β-catenin-mediated activation of the erk-p21cip/waf <dig> pathway following vpa treatment may be attributed to upregulation of ras, suggested by the increase in the level of ras seen after β-catenin overexpression. the vpa-induced increase in the level of ras may be due to the stabilization of β-catenin as a result of inhibition of gsk3?. increases in ras following modulation of the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway have been demonstrated in various cell types, including primary hepatocytes, and β-catenin has been identified as an important mediator of that process  <cit> . regulation of ras protein levels by the wnt/β-catenin system is mediated by polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation . differentiation and proliferation occur independently in the cerebellar cortex of the developing embryo  <cit> ; however, the mechanism underlying the differential regulation of the two processes has not been described. in this study, we found that differentiation and proliferation occurred independently in regions of the developing brain of embryos treated with vpa. we saw no brdu-positive cells among tuj1-positive npcs following vpa treatment. we also did not observe any proliferating cells among differentiated npcs stimulated to differentiate by β-catenin overexpression or by vpa treatment to express increased levels of p21cip/waf <dig>  these results indicate that mutually exclusive patterns of differentiation and proliferation during neuronal differentiation and development may be regulated via the common ras-erk-p21cip/waf <dig> pathway involving β-catenin.

however, the effects of vpa, particularly its effect on proliferation, were modest or only partially inhibited by increases in p21cip/waf <dig> or sirna-mediated β-catenin knockdown in several different cases. these results indicate the possibility that vpa-induced differentiation and inhibition of proliferation occur in part via different routes, including, e.g., the pathway affected by inhibition of hdac  <cit> . although we improved the efficiency of transfection by making modifications to the standard method, the limited effectiveness of sirnas in general may also be a contributing factor in the weak effects seen on differentiation and inhibition of proliferation . the concomitant stimulation of differentiation and inhibition of proliferation in npcs and the developing rat embryo by vpa treatment indicate potential utility for vpa in the treatment of neuroblastomas  <cit>  and/or in neuronal regeneration.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that vpa induces neuronal differentiation and inhibition of proliferation of cortical npcs at least partly via the ras-erk-p21cip/waf1-pathway mediated by β-catenin. we propose that this mechanism of vpa action may contribute to an explanation of its anti-tumor and neuroprotective effects, as well as elucidate its role in the independent regulation of differentiation and proliferation in the cerebral cortex of developing rat embryos. regulation of ras stability in neuronal differentiation and inhibition of proliferation may indicate a new role of the protooncoprotein ras in the differentiation of stem cells and in development.
