BACKGROUND
progression through the cell-division cycle requires phosphorylation events carried out by cyclin-dependent protein kinases  and the activation of the cdks is a central issue of cell cycle regulation. the wee1/myt <dig> protein kinases mediate inhibitory phosphorylation of cdk <dig>  on tyrosine  <dig>  and threonine  <dig>   <cit> – <cit> , whereas dualspecificity phosphatases of the cdc <dig>  family can dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine as well as phosphothreonine residues, therefore activating their physiological substrates, the cdks  <cit> , <cit> . in mammalian cells, cdc <dig> phosphatase family, including cdc25a, cdc25b and cdc25c, have been identified and found to regulate the cell cycle  <cit> , <cit> . in hamster bhk <dig> cell, cdc25b can activate initially cdc2/cyclin b, also named the maturation-promoting factor , which initiates mitosis through the activation of cdc25c  <cit> . our previous studies demonstrated that dephosphorylation of ser  <dig> and ser <dig> of cdc25b in the g <dig> phase induced the activation of cdc25b, which can activate mpf efficiently and resume mitosis by the direct dephosphorylation of cdc2-tyr <dig> in fertilized mouse eggs  <cit> , <cit> . these results support that cdc25b plays a critical regulatory role in g2/m progression in the mitosis.

the 14-3- <dig> proteins are highly conserved in eukaryotes binding to their phospho-serine and phospho-threonine-containing ligands to regulate a wide range of cellular phenomena involved in development and growth including cell cycle control, apoptosis and signal transduction  <cit> – <cit> . seven 14-3- <dig> isoforms  expressed in mammalian share about 50% amino acid identity and, consequently, highly similar protein conformations to form either homodimers or heterodimers that provide the functional basis for the target binding  <cit> , <cit> . of particular interest is dimeric 14-3- <dig> proteins,which has a role in regulation of cell division. in hela cells, 14-3-3ζ cooperating with polo-like kinase  <dig>  is required for mitotic exit and correct cytokinesis  <cit> . in cardiomyocyte, knockdown of 14-3-3ε causes decreased cardiac proliferation and a reduced number of cells in g2/m  <cit> . more recently it has been reported that14-3-3η localizes in the metaphase ‖ spindle of mouse eggs  <cit> , and 14-3-3η is essential for normal meiotic spindle formation during in vitro maturation of mouse oocytes  <cit> . these results support the concept that 14-3- <dig> proteins are responsible for regulating mitosis and meiosis in mammalian cells.

studies in hela cells have demonstrated that ser <dig> is a primary 14-3- <dig> binding site in cdc25b, and this binding blocks the access of the catalytic site, thereby directly inhibiting the activity of cdc25b  <cit> . ser <dig> phosphorylation is maintained into mitosis, but phosphorylation of ser <dig> disrupts 14-3- <dig> binding to ser <dig>  mimicking the effect of inhibiting ser <dig> phosphorylation on both cdc25b activity and localization  <cit> . in mouse oocytes, mutation ser <dig> to ala in cdc25b cannot bind to endogenous 14-3-3β whereas endogenous 14-3-3β can bind to wild type cdc25b  <cit> . our previous studies in immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that 14-3-3ε interacts with phosphorylated cdc25b at ser <dig> directly, but not with unphosphorylated cdc25b, and that the binding contributes to maintaining prophase ∣ arrest in the mouse oocyte  <cit> . however, there has been no proof of whether 14-3-3ε regulates the mitosis in fertilized mouse eggs. in the current study, we investigated whether 14-3-3ε binding with cdc25b-ser <dig> which is phosphorylated by protein kinase a  regulates the early development of mouse embryos. we show here that 14-3-3ε interacts and cooperates with cdc25b phosphorylated at ser <dig> regulating g2/m transition of mitotic progress of fertilized mouse eggs. we also show that knockdown of 14-3-3ε results in the block of g2/m transition and 14-3-3ε is primarily responsible for sequestering cdc25b in cytoplasm. our studies suggest that 14-3-3ε binding to cdc25b-ser <dig> phosphorylated by pka induces mitotic arrest at one-cell stage by inactivation of mpf in fertilized mouse eggs.

RESULTS
14-3-3ε mrna and protein expression in fertilized mouse eggs
we have previously demonstrated the only 14-3-3ε, one of the seven 14-3- <dig> isoforms, existed in gv and gvbd mouse oocytes and the expression of 14-3-3ε remained unchanged during gv and gvbd stages  <cit> . fertilized mouse eggs at g <dig> phase were collected and used to amplify the mrna of seven 14-3- <dig> isoforms. the results of rt-pcr showed that only 14-3-3ε existed in g <dig> phase of fertilized mouse eggs . in order to determine the expression levels of 14-3-3ε in fertilized mouse eggs, rt-pcr and western blot were used to detect the mrna and protein expression of 14-3-3ε, respectively, in g <dig>  s, g <dig> and m phases. rt-pcr and western blot analysis revealed that 14-3-3ε mrna expression and 14-3-3ε protein expression were present at constant levels at four phases of fertilized mouse eggs  . contrary to our results, santanu de and his colleagues  <cit>  have reported that mouse mature metaphase || -arrest eggs express all seven 14-3- <dig> isoforms and 14-3-3β, 14-3-3ε,14-3-3η and 14-3-3ζ appear in lesser amounts in mature metaphase || -arrest eggs than in immature oocytes.

14-3-3ε knockdown embryos failed in g2/m transition
to explore the role of 14-3-3ε in g2/m transition of fertilized mouse eggs, a small interference rna  at concentrations of 20 μmol  was microinjected into the cytoplasm of fertilized mouse eggs at g <dig> stage  to knock down endogenous 14-3-3ε, which resulted in the strongest suppression without embryo lethality caused by over-microinjection. the fertilized eggs were then cultured in m <dig> medium at 37°c for 15 h to allow time for rnai-mediated targeting of mrna, which was assessed by rt-pcr  and western blotting . mouse fertilized eggs were either not microinjected or microinjected with control sirna as control groups. as shown in figure 2b, 14-3-3ε sirna microinjection caused 70–80% depletion of 14-3-3ε . the morphology change and cleavage rate in each group were calculated after counting and observed under a phase-contrast microscope 19 h after the injection of sirna . in the two control groups,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of embryos had reached the two-cell stage at 31 h after the hcg injection, and there was no significant difference between the two control groups . a high number of embryos microinjected with 14-3-3ε sirna arrested at one-cell stage, and only 20% of embryos reached two-cell stage 19 h after the injection of sirna  . in addition, abnormal cleavage rate was significantly increased in the 14-3-3ε sirna eggs . fewer than 5% of eggs were dead after the various injection  . the fertilized eggs injected control sirna were morphologically normal compared to the no injection eggs . compared to the two controls, embryos of 14-3-3ε knockdown group were 15% more likely to displayed abnormal cleavage .

we have previously demonstrated the mitotic entry of mouse fertilized eggs is regulated by change in mpf activity  <cit> . in order to better understand whether 14-3-3ε sirna can inactivate mpf, we detected the mpf activity and phosphorylation status of cdc2-tyr <dig>  at 15 h after 14-3-3ε sirna microinjection,  <dig> fertilized eggs cultured in m <dig> medium were collected at indicated time points for the assay of mpf activity with histone h <dig> as the substrate. in control groups, mpf activity was consistently low at 15- <dig>  h after control sirna injection or no injection , increased initially at 16 h , and reached its maximal level at  <dig>  h  and began to decrease at 17 h . in contrast, the mpf activity remained at low levels at 15-17 h after 14-3-3ε sirna injection   . meanwhile, we measured the phosphorylation status of cdc2-tyr <dig> in the control and 14-3-3ε sirna microinjection groups by western blotting . in control groups, there was strong inhibitory phosphorylation of cdc2-tyr <dig> at 15- <dig>  h, a reduced phosphorylation level at 16 h, and no signal at  <dig>  h after control sirna injection or no injection. in 14-3-3ε sirna injected eggs, the inhibitory phosphorylation of cdc2-tyr <dig> was observed at 15- <dig>  h after 14-3-3ε sirna injection. these results were consistent with the mpf activity measurements. these findings clearly indicate that 14-3-3ε sirna increases the phosphorylation of tyr <dig> in cdc <dig> and the absence of 14-3-3ε blocks cell cycle progression by regulating the mpf activity at the g2/m transition of fertilized mouse eggs.

14-3- <dig> proteins play important roles in the regulation of cell development through binding to a large number of intracellular proteins containing specific phospho-serine/theonine motifs that are targeted by various classes of protein kinases. meanwhile, 14-3- <dig> proteins as a critical integration point for many of the protein kinases and phosphatases that control the transition from g <dig> into m phase  <cit> , <cit> . one of the most well established roles for 14-3- <dig> proteins is in the control of cell cycle progression. in this study, we provide the experimental evidence for an important role of 14-3-3ε regulating mitotic progression. cells lacking 14-3-3σ in marked contrast to normal cells, lead to impaired cytokinesis, loss of plk <dig> at the midbody, and the accumulation of binucleate cells  <cit> . in hela cells, preventing phosphorylation of protein kinase cε  binding to 14-3- <dig> also causes defects in the completion of cytokinesis  <cit> . similar to these studies, our studies showed that in the absence of 14-3-3ε, g2/m transition, as well as the cleavage rates, is impaired, and affected embryos display abnormal morphology, as indicated by irregular cleavage. since downregulation of 14-3-3ε can interfere with the mitotic entry, it raises a particularly important question of whether or not 14-3-3ε can regulate mpf activation in fertilized mouse eggs. mpf inactivation obviously occurred in embryos injected with 14-3-3ε sirna by inhibitory phosphorylation of cdc2-tyr <dig>  thus, depletion of 14-3-3ε protein after 14-3-3ε rnai treatment may prevent mitosis progression through inhibition of mpf activity.

co-injection of 14-3-3ε mrna and cdc25b-ser321a mrna induces mitotic resumption in dbcamp-arrested eggs
pka activator, dibutyryl camp  has a critical function in regulation of meiotic arrest and meiotic maturation in mouse oocytes  <cit> , <cit> . our previous study demonstrated that 2 mmol/l membrane-permeable dbcamp led to maximal g <dig> arrest, suggesting inhibition of the g2/m transition in fertilized mouse eggs  <cit> . moreover, we previously demonstrated that 14-3-3ε binding to ser <dig> of cdc25b blocked meiotic resumption in mouse oocytes  <cit> . to test whether 14-3-3ε binding to cdc25b-ser <dig> affected the mitosis, mouse one-cell stage embryos  were first incubated in m <dig> medium containing 2 mmol/l dbcamp and 1 h later microinjected with 14-3-3ε mrna solely or co-injected with mrna of cdc25b-s321a or cdc25b-wt at a concentration of 300 μg/ml. microinjection of cdc25b-s321a mrna or cdc25b-wt mrna solely served as the positive controls. our recent study demonstrated wee1b is a potential pka target and ser  <dig> phosphorylation of wee1b is required for pka-induced mpf inhibition in fertilized mouse eggs  <cit> . since wee1b may be phosphorylated by exogenous dbcamp, we also detected the expression levels of various cdc25b and 14-3-3ε mrnas in eggs with wee1b-ser  <dig> phosphorylation. figure 3a showed that all the microinjected cdc25b mrnas and 14-3-3ε mrna were translated efficiently in mouse fertilized eggs under the condition that endogenous wee1b-ser  <dig> was phosphorylated by 2 mmol/l exogenous dbcamp. in the negative control groups , none of the mouse eggs was able to enter the m phase of mitosis because of inhibition of g2/m transition induced by dbcamp which was similar to our previous results  <cit> . the cleavage rates in embryos co-injected with14-3-3ε mrna and cdc25b-ser321a mrna or injected with cdc25b-ser321a mrna solely were significantly increased, nearly  <dig> % of embryos had developed to the two-cell stage at 12 h after the microinjection  even wee1b-ser  <dig> was phosphorylated. however, none of the eggs co-injected with 14-3-3ε mrna and cdc25b-wt mrna or injected with cdc25b-wt mrna solely reached two-cell stage 12 h after the microinjection in the presence of dbcamp, which was similar to the negative controls. in addition, eggs with injection of 14-3-3ε mrna alone still arrested at one-cell stage at 12 h after the microinjection, suggesting overexpression of 14-3-3ε had no effect on the mitotic entry with dbcamp .

we also measured the mpf activity and phosphorylation status of cdc2-tyr <dig> in eggs injected with various mrnas in the presence of dbcamp. as anticipated, mpf activity in the eggs co-injected with 14-3-3ε and cdc25b-s321a mrnas or injected with cdc25b-ser321a mrna solely increasing initially at 8 h , and peaking at 9 h after microinjection . in contrast, mpf activity remained at a relatively low level in the 14-3-3ε mrna or cdc25b-wt mrna solely injected, co-injection of 14-3-3ε and cdc25b-wt mrna or two negative controls at 7-10 h after microinjection  . simultaneously, we detected the phosphorylation status of cdc2-tyr <dig> in all of the examined groups . in control groups, inhibitory phosphorylation of cdc2-tyr <dig> was observed at 7-10 h after microinjection. similar results were observed in 14-3-3ε mrna or cdc25b-wt mrna solely injected and co-injection of 14-3-3ε and cdc25b-wt mrna groups, indicating that overexpression of neither 14-3-3ε solely nor 14-3-3ε and cdc25b-wt can dephosphorylate cdc2-tyr <dig> in the presence of dbcamp. on the contrary, strong cdc2-tyr <dig> phosphorylation was found only at 7 h, and no phosphorylation signal at 9 h co-injected with 14-3-3ε and cdc25b-ser321a mrnas or injected with cdc25b-ser321a mrna solely. these results were consistent with the mpf activity measurements. these data suggest that 14-3-3ε binding to cdc25b-ser <dig> phosphorylated by pka induces mitotic arrest at one-cell stage by inactivation of mpf.

cdc25b is a key regulator of entry into mitosis, and its activity and localization are regulated by binding of the 14-3- <dig> proteins  <cit> . our previous studies demonstrated that the ser <dig> of cdc25b plays a critical regulatory role in the g2/m transition by activating mpf in fertilized mouse eggs. overexpression of cdc25b-ser321a in fertilized mouse eggs can induce cdc2-tyr <dig> dephosphorylation and overcome g <dig> arrest induced by dbcamp, whereas wild type cdc25b has no effect on mitotic resumption  <cit> . in the present study, the mitotic arrest in the fertilized mouse eggs induced by dbcamp was completely reversed by co-expression of 14-3-3ε and cdc25b-ser321a despite of phosphorylation of endogenous wee1b-ser  <dig>  which was similar to the injection of cdc25b-ser321a solely. in contrast, none of the eggs co-expression of 14-3-3ε and cdc25b-wt or expression of cdc25b-wt solely could efficiently override the g <dig> arrest in the presence of dbcamp. in addition, overexpression of 14-3-3ε alone did not affect the division. these findings strongly suggest that ser <dig> of cdc25b is the major site for 14-3-3ε binding and this binding likely blocks access to mpf, required for mitotic entry.

co-localization of endogenous 14-3-3ε and cdc25b in fertilized eggs
several previous studies demonstrated that binding of 14-3- <dig> to cdc25b induce the redistribution of cdc25b from the nucleus to the cytoplasm  <cit> , <cit> . therefore, we observed the co-localization of endogenous cdc25b and 14-3-3ε at every phase of cell cycle in fertilized mouse eggs with indirect immunofluorescence. we examined  <dig> different eggs from g <dig>  s, early g <dig>  late g <dig>  early m and late m phases, respectively, and all showed the same pattern of immunofluorescent staining. as shown in figure  <dig>  red fluorescent cdc25b signals and green fluorescent 14-3-3ε signals were co-localized primarily in the cytoplasm at g <dig> and s phases, respectively . in early g <dig> phase eggs, 14-3-3ε and cdc25b signals were observed in the cytoplasm . partial cdc25b signals translocated to the nucleus of eggs, whereas 14-3-3ε signals still remained in the cytoplasm at the late g <dig> phase . however, the cdc25b signals and 14-3-3ε signals in the nucleus apparently weakened and became distributed in the cytoplasm again at early and late m phases, respectively . negative control showed no signal of cdc25b and 14-3-3ε .

to further understand whether 14-3-3ε knockdown can affect the distribution of cdc25b, we determined the localization of endogenous cdc25b and 14-3-3ε 15 h  after 14-3-3ε sirna or control sirna microinjection by indirect immunofluorescence. the red fluorescent cdc25b signals were localized in the cytoplasm at early g <dig> phase in control sirna injection group in  <dig> of  <dig> eggs which was similar to the normal eggs of early g <dig> phase in figure 4c , while cdc25b signals were highly concentrated on the nucleus in  <dig> of  <dig> eggs, indicating cdc25b transfers from cytoplasm to the nucleus at early g <dig> phase when 14-3-3ε knocked down . none of the fertilized eggs injected with 14-3-3ε sirna showed the 14-3-3ε staining  compared to the control sirna injection eggs . these data suggest that 14-3-3ε may control the cytoplasmic localization of cdc25b.

it has been shown that endogenous cdc25b is mainly nuclear, but a fraction resides in the cytoplasm during the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle in hela cells  <cit> . contrary to this study, our immunofluoresence experiments revealed a restricted cytoplasmic co-localization of 14-3-3ε and cdc25b at g <dig>  s, early g <dig> and m phases in fertilized eggs. moreover, we also observed that cdc25b transferred from cytoplasm to the nucleus at the late g <dig> phase, together with previous studies  <cit> , <cit> , support that cdc25b can actively shuttle in and out of the nucleus of the fertilized eggs at g <dig> phase whereas 14-3-3ε may bind to cdc25b to sequester cdc25b in the cytoplasm. additionally, our observation that the cytoplasmic localization of cdc25b was altered at early g <dig> phase following deletion of 14-3-3ε suggests that 14-3-3ε might directly modulate cdc25b distribution.

co-localization of exogenously expressed 14-3-3ε and cdc25b
to confirm the subcellular localization of exogenous 14-3-3ε and cdc25b, the pegfp-cdc25b-wt and pegfp-cdc25b-s321a plasmids were co-injected with prfp-ha-14-3-3ε into fertilized mouse eggs, respectively, at the g <dig> phase , and then the microinjected eggs were transferred into m <dig> medium containing 2 mmol/l dbcamp. thirty eggs from early g <dig> and late g <dig> phases for each group were analyzed, respectively. as shown in figure 5a, when mouse embryos injected with pegfp-cdc25b-wt/prfp-ha-14-3-3ε or pegfp-cdc25b-s321a/prfp-ha-14-3-3ε entered early g <dig> phase, green fluorescent cdc25b signals and red fluorescent 14-3-3ε signals were co-localized primarily in the cytoplasm of mouse fertilized egg. then, the green fluorescent signals of cdc25b-s321a were translocated to the nucleus whereas cdc25b-wt signals were observed in the cytoplasm of mouse fertilized egg without nucleus accumulation at late g <dig> phase. the red fluorescent 14-3-3ε signals were detected primarily in the cytoplasm in both cdc25b-wt and cdc25b-s321a groups at late g <dig> phases . these data suggest that cdc25b cannot transfer to the nucleus when cdc25b-ser <dig> is phosphorylated and cytoplasmic retention of cdc25b-s321a at early g <dig> phase is required for activating mpf.

it has been reported that 14-3-3β and 14-3-3ε specifically bind to ser <dig> of cdc25b and that mutation of cdc25b ser <dig> to ala impairs 14-3- <dig> binding and completely abolished the cytoplasmic localization of cdc25b  <cit> . in contrast, we observed a cytoplamic localization of cdc25b-s321a at early g <dig> phase and then cdc25b-s321a transferred from cytoplasm to nucleus at late g <dig> phase. these results are consistent with the observations that human cdc25c in which the mutation of ser <dig> to ala at the 14-3- <dig> binding site does not completely abolish its cytoplasmic localization  <cit> . an intrinsic nuclear localization sequence  and a nuclear export sequence  lies between the n-terminal regulatory domain and the c-terminal catalytic domain of cdc25c  <cit> , <cit> . the major 14-3- <dig> binding sites of human cdc25c-ser <dig> and xenopus cdc25c-ser <dig> are located right next to the nls  <cit> , <cit> . mutation of the nuclear export sequence makes cdc25b less efficient in inducing mitosis in the cytoplasm  <cit> . moreover, our previous results showed that deletion of functional nuclear export sequence in the n-terminus of cdc25b is sufficient to abrogate cdc25b export in mouse oocytes. interference with nuclear export reduced the ability of cdc25b protein to induce gvbd suggesting that cdc25b is needed to activate cdc2/cyclinb in the cytoplasm . the ser <dig> of mouse cdc25b, which corresponds to the ser <dig> of human cdc25b and the ser <dig> of xenopus cdc25c, when mutated to a nonphosphorylatable alanine, is incapable of affecting the nls and nes, thus accelerating mitosis compared to the cdc25b-wt at the presence of dbcamp in our present study. although it is unclear what causes the cytoplasmic localization of cdc25b-s321a without 14-3-3ε binding at early g <dig> phase, the nuclear export of cdc25b-s321a is likely regulated by nes. in hela cells, cdc25c was not exclusively localized to the nucleus unless both 14-3- <dig> binding and nes function were disrupted  <cit> . thus, cdc25b-s321a may have a normal nes and the accumulation of cdc25b-s321a in nucleus at early g <dig> phase may also require inactivation of its nes.

an important observation made by kornbluth and colleagues is that 14-3- <dig> binding to xenopus cdc <dig> phosphorylated on s <dig> protects this mitotic phosphatase from premature dephosphorylation and activation  <cit> . removal of 14-3- <dig> proteins binding to phosphorylated cdc <dig> during interphase is one of the early steps in mitotic activation during the pathway of dna-responsive checkpoints  <cit> . several reports demonstrate that the complex of cdc2/cyclinb <dig> is first activated on centrosomes and full activation occurs in the nucleus  <cit> , <cit> . moreover, cytoplasmic cdc25b may mediate the activation of centrosomal cdk <dig>  in late prophase  <cit> . thus, it is possible that cdc25b-s321a activates the mpf much more efficiently in cytoplasm and then makes a full activation of mpf in nucleus whereas phosphorylated ser <dig> on cdc25b-wt binding to 14-3-3ε fails to dephosphorylate activating mpf under conditions that maintains exogenous dibutyryl camp.

our previous studies have demonstrated that the cdc25b-s <dig> is phosphorylated at the g <dig> and s phases in the fertilized mouse eggs, whereas no phosphorylation of cdc25b-s <dig> was observed at the g <dig> and m phases in vivo, suggesting that unphosphorylatable cdc25b is required for activating mpf  <cit> , <cit> . in xenopus eggs, protein phosphatase  <dig>  is required for dephosphorylation of cdc <dig> at ser <dig> for initiation of mitosis  <cit> . based on our findings, we propose a model that phosphorylation of cdc25b-ser <dig> by pka allows 14-3-3ε to bind cdc25b, which results in cdc25b being sequestered in the cytoplasm at g <dig> and s phases, whereas phosphorylated cdc25b is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase, activated under appropriate conditions without 14-3-3ε binding at early g <dig> phase, and stimulates cytoplasmic mpf initially at early g <dig> phase and then nucleus mpf at late g <dig> phase, triggering g2/m transition in fertilized mouse eggs. furthermore, downregulation of 14-3-3ε inhibiting mpf activity may due to the translocation of cdc25b to the nucleus when 14-3-3ε knocked down, which could not activate the mpf efficiently in the cytoplasm at early g <dig> phase. additional regulatory mechanisms of 14-3-3ε for the suppression of the g2/m phase when 14-3-3ε deleted cannot be ruled out in the mitosis of fertilized mouse eggs. 14-3-3ε deletion leads to significant accumulation of cardiomyocytes in the g0/g1phase by upregulation of p27kip <dig> and downregulation of cyclin e <dig>  respectively, which in turn is likely to depress progression into g2/m  <cit> . proteomic analysis of interphase and mitotic hela cells have demonstrated that several known 14-3- <dig> targets bound to 14-3- <dig> proteins, including the cell cycle regulator wee <dig>  the par-1a  and par-1b  kinases, β-tubulin, which have been implicated in regulating cell polarity, microtubule dynamics, and the cell division cycle  <cit> , <cit> . thus, it is likely that these factors, such as cyclin e <dig>  wee <dig> or β-tubulin may contribute to the cell cycle defects in 14-3-3ε knockdown fertilized mouse eggs.

in this study, we did not give the evidence that which protein phosphates dephosphorylate and activate cdc25b at early g <dig> phase. in the future, it is of great importance to probe the molecular mechanisms how cdc25b is dephosphorylated and activated at early g <dig> phase under appropriate conditions in fertilized mouse eggs. moreover, additional functional experiments will be needed to determine the timing of 14-3-3ε absence from cdc25b in the fertilized mouse eggs.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, for the first time, we provide the experimental evidence for an important role of 14-3-3ε regulating g2/m transition and cdc25b distribution in the fertilized mouse eggs. the results of the study indicate that 14-3-3ε is required for the mitotic entry in the fertilized mouse eggs. the activation of mpf by cdc25b in the cytoplasm at early g <dig> phase is responsible for initiation of g2/m transition in the fertilized mouse eggs. these results suggest that 14-3-3ε binding to cdc25b-s <dig> phosphorylated by pka blocks the mitotic division by inactivation of mpf at g <dig> and s phases in fertilized mouse eggs. 14-3-3ε knockdown also resulting in the mitotic arrest may due to the lost of cytoplasmic localization of cdc25b, thereby inactivating mpf initially in the cytoplasm.
