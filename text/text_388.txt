BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile, an anaerobic sporogenic bacterium, is recognized as the major pathogen in healthcare associated intestinal infections in humans and also as an important animal pathogen. in addition to the potential for serious  infections in animals, are companion and food animals considered as an important potential source for human community-acquired infections  <cit> . this indicates the importance of preventive measures targeting animals and food  <cit> . several studies have looked at similarity between strains isolated from humans and animals  <cit> , but typically focusing on limited number of different species and restricted to a narrow geographic region.

pcr ribotyping is currently the method of choice for differentiation of c. difficile strains. in humans more than  <dig> pcr ribotypes are recognized while the number of reported animal associated pcr ribotypes is much lower  <cit> . it could be expected that variety of animal associated c. difficile will increase with the increased number of typed animal isolates. to date piglets and pig farms are hosts and environments where c. difficile has been most extensively studied  <cit> . for this reservoir the modes of transmission and potential association with human infections are also best understood  <cit> .

c. difficile strains can also be differentiated into toxinotypes according to the differences in the toxin a and toxin b encoding region   <cit> . toxinotypes v and xi are particularly often isolated from animals  <cit> , but the reason for this association is not known. many published studies report c. difficile pcr ribotypes, but not many do report the toxinotypes  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to collect c. difficile isolates from different countries and different animals and to compare them with classical agarose gel-based and sequencer-based pcr ribotyping and determine the toxinotypes.

RESULTS
altogether  <dig> c. difficile isolates from  <dig> animal species were obtained from  <dig> laboratories from  <dig> different countries  . inclusion criteria were one strain  per animal species per laboratory. each participating country contributed  <dig> to  <dig> isolates . strains were isolated between  <dig> and  <dig>  only five isolates were from  <dig> to  <dig>  with the majority of isolates  from  <dig>

the majority of isolates were from pigs  and cattle , followed by poultry , dogs , horses, rabbits , cats , goats , partridges and raccoons , wild hare, crow and goose .

only  <dig> isolates were from animals with clinical signs,  <dig> were from clinically normal animals and for  <dig> isolates disease status of the animal was not known.

for  <dig> animals antibiotic use was unknown and further  <dig> animals had no history of antibiotic exposure. prior use of antibiotics was reported for isolates from  <dig> animals. for  <dig> of them antibiotic was not specified and for the remaining eight antibiotics given to animals were amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, amoxicillin, colistin, enrofloxacin, cefovecin , gentamicin, oxytetracycline, and sulfonamide. animals treated with antibiotics were cattle , cat , dog , horse , pig  and rabbit . twenty isolates from animals with reported use of antibiotics belonged to  <dig> different pcr ribotypes  <dig>   <dig> and 084). none of those pcr ribotypes was associated with a specific antibiotic.

molecular characterization of strains with two pcr ribotyping approaches
results of agarose gel-based and sequencer-based pcr ribotyping for  <dig> c. difficile isolates are presented in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

using classical agarose-gel based pcr ribotyping all  <dig> isolates were distributed into  <dig> different pcr ribotypes . with sequencer-based pcr ribotyping,  <dig> pcr ribotypes could be identified. this is due to higher discriminatory power of capillary sequencer-based pcr ribotyping for some pcr ribotypes;  <dig> ,  <dig> , 014/ <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  . comparison of agarose gel pcr ribotypes with the corresponding band profiles generated by capillary electrophoresis-based pcr ribotyping is shown in figure  <dig>  the discrepancies in the nomenclature between both methods, observed for some of the strains , are due to use of a different set of c. difficile reference strains and reflects the difficulties in attempts to unify pcr ribotyping nomenclature.

two most common pcr ribotypes representing  <dig> % of all strains were  <dig> and 014/ <dig>  pcr ribotypes with  <dig> or  <dig> representatives were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

molecular characterization of strains by toxinotyping
within toxigenic isolates   <dig> different toxinotypes were identified . more than a half of the isolates belonged to the nonvariant toxinotype  <dig> . the variant toxinotypes were v , xii , vi , xia , xib , iii , iv, i, viii and xix . eight strains  from four different pcr ribotypes  <dig>   <dig>  084) were non-toxigenic.

distribution of pcr ribotypes and toxinotypes in different animal hosts and in different countries
table  <dig> shows distribution of c. difficile pcr ribotypes and toxinotypes from collected isolates throughout countries and animal species. isolates from pigs and cattle were the most frequent and were received from  <dig> and  <dig> of the  <dig> participating countries, respectively. the variability of pcr ribotypes was accordingly also the largest in these two hosts;  <dig> pcr ribotypes came from cattle and  <dig> from pigs . distribution of the  <dig> most prevalent pcr ribotypes in countries is presented in figure  <dig> pcr ribotype 014/ <dig> was found in the majority of the animal species included in the collection  across  <dig> different countries . pcr ribotypes that were found only in particular animal species, but in several different countries, were pcr ribotype  <dig>  which was found only in pigs but in four different countries, and pcr ribotype  <dig>  which was found in cattle in three different countries and only in a single case in horse.

toxinotype v strains of different pcr ribotypes were mainly associated with cattle, horses and pigs and were rarely found in other animals. also toxinotype xi strains  were mainly associated with cattle and horses.

discussion
several publications are available about isolation and characterization of c. difficile from animals, but they are usually limited to a specific geographical region and data of the different studies are sometimes difficult to compare due to nomenclature of pcr ribotypes that is not unified. the advantage of the international animal c. difficile strain collection is in performance of strain typing in the single setting, hereby minimizing the ambiguities in pcr ribotype designations. additionally, two pcr ribotyping approaches have been used; the standard one using ‘cardiff’ nomenclature and webribo based analysis . this is not a prevalence study with collection of samples from defined number of farms or hosts as was done for hospitals and human isolates in europe  <cit> . the isolates in this study were collected from different labs in different countries and the criterion was one pcr ribotype per animal species per lab. therefore the collected strains are not reflecting the prevalence of pcr ribotypes but are giving a good basis to assess the diversity of animal associated c. difficile.

our results show that variability of pcr ribotypes present in different animal species is large. isolates from pigs and cattle were most common, perhaps reflecting the importance of c. difficile in pigs and concerns about zoonotic transmission from cattle  . in contrast to cattle and pigs, are cats, dogs, rabbits and poultry clearly understudied and are probably associated with a broader variety of c. difficile pcr ribotypes than currently recognized. only two countries have contributed poultry isolates to the collection, but they represent  <dig> different pcr ribotypes. strains from captive rabbits were contributed only by one country, but represent  <dig> different pcr ribotypes .

pcr ribotypes detected in six animal species in different geographical regions

some pcr ribotypes seem to be more often associated with a particular animal host. many publications report pcr ribotype  <dig> in pigs  <cit>  and type  <dig> in cattle  <cit>  . results presented here confirm this observation , but also suggest that the well-known animal-associated pcr ribotype  <dig> may not be currently present in animals in all countries. in addition to types  <dig> and  <dig> some other pcr ribotypes are typically associated with pigs, such as pcr ribotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . recent reports from australia describe a new genotype in terms of pcr ribotype  and toxin genes  in pigs  <cit> . pcr ribotype  <dig> that was prevalent in humans in many countries within the past ten years was in this collection of animal strains found only in usa and canada .

toxinotype v and xi and binary toxin positive strains were initially reported to be the prevalent population of strains isolated from animals   <cit> . however, the results of this study show that nonvariant strains of toxinotype  <dig> are widespread in animals and that the proportion of binary toxin positive strains can be as low as  <dig> %.

all isolates in the collection were distributed into  <dig> pcr ribotypes, but only a few of those contained five or more isolates, and the majority was represented only by a few or a single isolate . this resembles the situation with human strain collections with many different pcr ribotypes, but only a few of them having a large number of isolates  <cit> . however, as the inclusion criterion for the collection was one pcr ribotype per animal species per laboratory, the number of isolates of a given pcr ribotype does not reflect the actual prevalence of this pcr ribotype in animal host. but the high number of isolates of a given pcr ribotype in the collection does reflect its broader geographic presence and possibly broader spectrum of animal species from which it was isolated.

all animal-associated pcr ribotypes with four or more isolates reported here  are among the most prevalent in diverse studies of human isolates  <cit> . in particular pcr ribotype 014/ <dig> is currently the most prevalent type isolated in europe and in some usa studies and is the only type that was present here in the majority of animal hosts . although type 014/ <dig> is not recognized as hypervirulent and is not associated with outbreaks or severe disease in humans, its ability to colonize many diverse hosts and its ubiquitous presence indicates considerable endemic potential of this particular pcr ribotype  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
pcr ribotype  <dig> is the most prevalent c. difficile type associated with this collection of animal isolates, but only with some hosts and in some countries. the second most prevalent pcr ribotype is 014/ <dig> which, in contrast, has broader range of animal hosts. variability of animal associated pcr ribotypes is substantial and is likely to increase with the number of typed animal isolates. large overlap of animal associated c. difficile pcr ribotypes with human strains furthers concerns about interspecies, including zoonotic, transmission of this important pathogen. moreover, strains that are prevalent in humans are also prevalent in different animals from different geographic areas, emphasizing that certain strains have a large potential for global dissemination.
