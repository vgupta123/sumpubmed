BACKGROUND
the regulation of gene expression in response to intrinsic and extrinsic cues is a fundamental cellular process in the growth and development of organisms. critical to the control of gene expression are transcription factors that bind to specific dna sequences and subsequently modulate gene transcription  <cit> . a significant number of transcription factors use a conserved zinc finger domain to bind their target dnas. zinc finger factors participate in a variety of cellular activities, such as development and differentiation, and play a role in human disease. in fact, the human genome encompasses approximately  <dig> to <dig> genes that contain a particular c2h2-type of zinc finger, which employs two cysteine and two histidine amino acid residues to coordinate the single zinc atom in the finger-like structure  <cit> . in the c2h2-type of zinc finger proteins, there is a highly conserved consensus sequence tgekpx  between adjacent zinc finger motifs. the zinc finger proteins containing this specific structure are termed kr端ppel-like zinc finger proteins because the structure was first found in drosophila kr端ppel protein  <cit> . many kr端ppel-like factors exhibit diverse regulatory functions in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and embryogenesis  <cit> . the scan   <cit> , which is also known as the leucine rich region   <cit> , krab   <cit> , and poz   <cit>  domains are highly conserved modules found in the n-terminus of c2h <dig> zinc finger transcription factors that have been demonstrated to mediate specific protein-protein interactions  <cit> . the scan domain is a conserved motif that appears to control the association of scan-containing proteins into non-covalent complexes, and may be the primary mechanism underlying partner choice in the dimerization of these transcription factors  <cit> . the genes encoding scan domains are clustered, often in tandem arrays, in both the human and mouse genomes and are capable of generating isoforms that may affect the function of family members. although the function of most of the family members is not known, some of the scan domain family members play roles in cell survival and differentiation or development  <cit> . like the krab motif, the scan domain-containing c2h <dig> zinc finger proteins are unique to the vertebrate lineage  <cit> .

human zinc finger protein  <dig>   <cit> ) is a member of the scan domain family of kr端ppel-like zinc finger transcription factors  <cit> . this gene is initially named as rsg-a  because its mrna can be amplified by homologous rt-pcr only in retinoic acid-untreated but not in retinoic acid-treated acute promyelocytic leukemia nb <dig> cells <cit> . znf <dig> shows 94% identity to its mouse homologue zinc finger protein  <dig>  which is the most highly conserved among the human-mouse scan family member orthologues pairs <cit> . tissue mrna analysis showed that znf <dig> gene was ubiquitously expressed  <cit> . the mouse zfp <dig> has been previously isolated from chondrocytic and mesenchymal precursor cell lines using a subtractive hybridization screening. zfp <dig> mrna is expressed during embryonic development and in different organs in adult, including rib cartilage, suggesting that zfp <dig> may have a role in cartilage differentiation and in basic cellular processes <cit> .

a study demonstrated that znf <dig> can specifically bind to the tcat repeats  in the first intron of the human tyrosine hydroxylase  gene, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines  <cit> . allelic variations of humth <dig> have a quantitative silencing effect on th gene expression in vitro, and correlate with quantitative and qualitative changes in the binding by znf <dig>  <cit> . znf <dig> mrna levels was present at high levels in catecholaminergic tissues including the substantia nigra, the hypothalamus and the olfactory bulb. in the rat embryo, the mrna was present at high levels in total embryonic head, which may reflect a role in brain development  <cit> ; however, the molecular mechanisms remain unknown.

the znf <dig> gene is located on chromosome 18q <dig>  <cit> , a region frequently deleted in colorectal carcinomas, suggesting a possible role in the negative regulation of tumor growth <cit> . znf <dig> contains four continuous typical c2h <dig> zinc fingers in its c-terminus, and one scan domain in its n-terminus  <cit> . biochemical binding study shows the scan domain of znf <dig> as a selective oligomerization domain <cit> . the scan domain of znf <dig> displays a suppressive effect on the transcription in cho and nih3t <dig> cells <cit> ; however, little else is known regarding its role in gene expression.

in the present study, we transiently overexpressed and silenced znf <dig> gene in the human embryo kidney  cells and then applied microarray assay to identify possible znf <dig> target genes. expression of interested candidate genes was also examined by real time rt-pcr, and these data correlated well with the array data. in general, our data reveal that znf <dig> modulates the expression of a large number of genes that are implicated in regulation of kinase activity, regulation of transcription, angiogenesis, brain development and response to dna damage. our analysis reveals for the first time that znf <dig> is a pleiotropic factor that has a role in hematopoiesis, brain development, tumor growth.

RESULTS
data analysis: general features
to identify znf <dig> target genes, a combined approach of transient overexpression and transient knockdown  are used to identify genes modified by the znf <dig> transcription factor with  <dig> k whole-genome 60-mer oligonucleotide microarrays, using a cellular model . plasmids overexpressing znf <dig> cdna  or control empty pcdna <dig> vectors were transiently transfected into hek <dig> cells for  <dig> hours. as expected, introduction of pcdna3-znf <dig> in hek <dig> cells resulted in higher expression of znf <dig> mrna than in cells transfected with control empty plasmid or untreated cells . real-time pcr results showed that the znf <dig> expression level was increased >  <dig> times in cells transfected with pcdna3-znf <dig> compared with control cells . for the reduction of znf <dig> expression, three hairpin sirna expression vectors against znf <dig> were generated  <cit>  and the knock-down of znf <dig> was assessed  <dig> hours after transfection of the hek <dig> cells. figure  <dig> showed that the three sirna expression vectors were found to efficiently eliminate the target mrna. the reduction of znf <dig> mrna levels in transfected cells appears to be approximately 60% at the best compared to the control level. due to no greater inhibition of znf <dig> mrna at longer times than  <dig> hours, transfection of the hek <dig> cells with the most efficient vector for  <dig> h was used in subsequent experiments.

rna samples were prepared from the transient overexpression and transient knockdown cells as well as control cells. probe labelling, hybridization, and scanning were done by shanghai biochip co., ltd . the complete list of genes with differential expression can be found at the website . microarray showed that  <dig> genes were up-regulated more than  <dig> -fold, while  <dig> were down-regulated by the overexpression of the znf <dig> gene , while  <dig> were up-regulated by the kd and  <dig> were down-regulated, using the same threshold . interestingly,  <dig> genes were identified in both situations, and  <dig>  behaved consistently between the two experiments  . these identified genes were subsequently used in pathway analysis with mappfinder.

using a threshold of  <dig> for data analysis,  <dig> genes were found to be regulated by the overexpression with  <dig> genes up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated  while  <dig> genes were regulated by the kd with  <dig> genes up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated . the overlap was found between transient overexpression and transient knockdown with  <dig> shared genes. thus, znf <dig> appears to modulate multiple transcriptional events, acting both as an activator and a repressor.

pathway analysis of the znf <dig> transient overexpression and knockdown signature
to further evaluate our microarray data, genmapp and mappfinder software  were used to organize gene expression data into mapps  that represent specific biological pathways and functionally grouped genes, based on the go system. three main classes of branches in the go tree are biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components  <cit> .

we focused on microarray gene expression data of  <dig> genes identified in both transient overexpression and transient knockdown treatment. using gene-association files from the go consortium, mappfinder assigns the thousands of genes in the dataset to numerous go terms. our analysis was limited to the go terms that comprise more than eight genes in a class. several significant  functional mapps were revealed with mappfinder and were presented in table  <dig>  gene pathways that are involved in the regulation of kinase activity and angiogenesis were significantly up-regulated. in contrast, processes associated with response to dna damage stimulus and brain development were down-regulated. many up-regulated processes are localized to cellular component  while down-regulated processes belong mainly to the cellular components . figure  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and table  <dig> showed the znf <dig> overexpression and znf <dig> knockdown differentially expressed genes involved in these signaling pathways.

quantitative real-time rt-pcr
twenty-one interested genes were selected and subjected to real-time pcr analysis to confirm our microarrays results. as shown in figure  <dig>  the direction of regulation of atp7a, reck, pdgfrb, bmpr <dig>  rb <dig>  brca <dig>  brca <dig>  atm, atrx, ifi <dig>  ccnb <dig>  myo <dig>  gadd45b, sema5a, nrp <dig>  ctgf, c <dig>  vegf, thbs <dig>  kitlg and foxp <dig>  by the overexpression and knockdown of znf <dig> was consistent with the microarray results.

discussion
in this study, we identify genes modified by the znf <dig> transcription factor with a combined strategy of transient overexpression and transient knockdown  in a cellular model , using oligonucleotide microarray technology. several gene pathways were revealed by mappfinder to be involved in processes of the regulation of kinase activity, transcription, angiogenesis, brain development and response to dna damage.

pathway of regulation of kinase activity was significantly affected . this pathway had a large number of expression changes, mostly due to the regulation of  <dig> genes , which were up-regulated in the znf191-overexpressed cells and down-regulated in the znf <dig> knockdown cells. in additional,  <dig> genes  were down-regulated in the znf191-overexpressed cells and up-regulated in the znf <dig> knockdown cells. a map of the genes involved in regulation of kinase activity was shown in figure  <dig>  gadd45b, originally termed myd <dig>  is first cloned as a myeloid differentiation primary response gene. it can be induced in the absence of protein synthesis following treatment of m <dig> myeloblastic leukemia cells with differentiation inducers <cit> , suggesting that gadd45b play a role in hematopoiesis. kitlg is a pleiotropic factor that acts in utero in germ cell and neural cell development, and hematopoiesis <cit> . accordingly, znf <dig> has been isolated from bone marrow and promyelocytic leukemia cell lines  <cit> . these data infer that znf <dig> may play a role in hematopoiesis.

angiogenesis was another pathway markedly affected by znf <dig> . as shown in figure  <dig>  ctgf, cyr <dig>  edn <dig>  myh <dig>  nrp <dig>  runx <dig>  thbs <dig> were up-regulated in the znf191-overexpressed cells, and down-regulated in the knockdown cells. in addition, ceacam <dig>  plxdc <dig>  cxcl <dig>  sema5a and vegf were down-regulated in the znf191-overexpressed cells, and up-regulated in the knockdown cells. angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, is required for a variety of normal proliferative processes. furthermore, angiogenesis is well established as also playing an important role in neoplastic growth and metastasis. vegf is a potent stimulator of angiogenesis. znf <dig> has been reported to be up-regulated in angiogenic tumor nodules where vegf expression is significantly decreased compared with preangiogenic nodules <cit> . in this study, our result in hek <dig> cells is consistent with the findings that in human breast carcinoma cells overexpression of znf <dig> results in a significant down-regulation of vegf, whereas silencing of znf <dig> with small interfering rna leads to increased vegf expression as well as the same inverse correlation between znf <dig> and vegf observed in malignant tissues from human colon and breast biopsies  <cit> . in addition, thrombospondin- <dig>  has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis through direct effects on endothelial cell migration and survival, and through effects on vascular endothelial cell growth factor bioavailability. aside from the inhibitory activity of angiogenesis, thbs <dig> also suppresses tumor growth by activating transforming growth factor beta and affects tumor cell function through interaction with cell surface receptors and regulation of extracellular proteases <cit> . the data in this study revealed that overexpression of znf <dig> resulted in a significant up-regulation of thbs <dig>  whereas silencing of znf <dig> led to decreased thbs <dig> expression in hek <dig> cells. taken together, these data suggest that znf <dig> may participate in negative regulation of angiogenesis. furthermore, bmpr <dig> is overexpressed in the majority of human lung carcinomas independent of cell type <cit> . pdgfr expression in colorectal cancer significantly correlates with lymphatic dissemination <cit> . myo <dig>  is critical in maintaining the malignant properties of the majority of human prostate cancers diagnosed today <cit> . the finding that overexpression of znf <dig> significantly down-regulated bmpr <dig>  pdgfr and myo <dig>  whereas silencing of znf <dig> increased bmpr <dig>  pdgfr and myo <dig> expression suggests a tumor suppressor role for znf <dig> in human cancers.

the response to dna damage node was significantly affected , mostly due to the regulation of brca <dig>  brca <dig>  atm, btg <dig> and atrx . the most obvious explanation for this induction was that it was related to initiation of dna replication. indeed, dna repair function is complementary to dna replication, as the latter process is not error-free and produces mismatches that need to be repaired. however, we reported here that overexpression or elimination of znf <dig> affected the upstream regulators of the dna damage pathway, such as atm, atrx, brca <dig> and btg <dig>  these data suggest that znf <dig> may be involved in the control of dna damage response in addition to the regulation of dna replication and concurrent dna repair. microarray and real-time pcr showed that rb <dig>  atm, atrx and brca <dig> genes were down-regulated in the znf191-overexpressed cells . accordingly, rb <dig> knockdown by sirna caused the down-regulation of atm, atrx and brca <dig> <cit> . rb <dig> mrna level was down-regulated in mcf- <dig> breast carcinoma cells by the overexpression of znf <dig> .

mice zfp <dig> transcript is detected early during embryogenesis in ectodermal, endodermal, mesodermal and extra-embryonic tissues. it is particularly observed in the developing central nervous system  <cit> . in rat, znf <dig> mrna is present at high levels in total embryonic head, and abundant in catecholaminergic tissues including substantia nigra, hypothalamus and olfactory bulb as well as peripheral catecholaminergic tissue adrenal medulla <cit> . in human, znf <dig> transcript is also detected in brain <cit> . these studies demonstrate an important role of znf <dig> in brain development. interestingly, in support with previous studies, our results showed a node affected by znf <dig> was the brain development node .  <dig> genes  down-regulated in the znf191-overexpressed cells and up-regulated in the znf <dig> knockdown cells . the human copper-transporting atp7a is essential for dietary copper uptake, normal development and function of the cns, and regulation of copper homeostasis in the body <cit> . in addition, studies on alzheimer's disease  suggest an important role for copper in the brain, with some ad therapies focusing on mobilising copper in ad brains <cit> . the transport of copper into the brain is complex and involves numerous players, including amyloid precursor protein, a beta peptide and cholesterol <cit> . interestingly, in a yeast two-hybrid experiment using the scan domain of znf <dig> as bait, we identified that the zinc finger transcription factor znf <dig> can interact with nae <dig> . foxp <dig> mutations in humans are associated with a disorder that affects both the comprehension of language and its production, speech <cit> . znf <dig> transcript was abundant in the mesencephalon, a structure that contains the major rat embryonic catecholaminergic tissues <cit> . accordingly, znf <dig> can specifically interact with the widespread tcat motif which constitutes the humth <dig> microsatellite in the tyrosine hydroxylase  gene  <cit> . allelic variations of humth <dig> are known to have a quantitative silencing effect on th gene expression and to correlate with quantitative and qualitative changes in the binding by znf <dig> <cit> . in this study, overexpression of znf <dig> resulted in a significant down-regulation of th, whereas knockdown of znf <dig> resulted in a non-significant change of th level. the expression level of the th gene is indistinguishable between the wild-type, zfp191+/-, and zfp191-/- mice <cit> . these data suggest that other genes may compensate at least in part for the loss of znf <dig> activity, ameliorating the effect of the znf <dig> knockdown. taken together, these data suggest that znf <dig> may be involved in the brain development and the neuropsychiatric diseases.

we have to point out that in the knockdown experiments we can only deduce the level of znf <dig> protein by the level of mrna of znf <dig> because no antibody against the znf <dig> factor is commercially available and the turn-over of the protein is still unknown. so there is no mean to ascertain whether and when the znf <dig> protein is reduced significantly. in addition, in this study hek <dig> cells were used as a cellular model to identify genes modified by the znf <dig> transcription factor. some other cells could give at least partially over transcriptome modification. furthermore, the transcriptional response found upon alteration of znf <dig> levels does not necessarily imply that this transcription factor regulates the differentially expressed genes. many of the observed changes could be downstream and not direct effects of znf <dig> regulation. a proof of direct regulation would require a promoter analysis or some kind of dna-protein binding experiment or in silico analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
we applied overexpression and sirna-mediated gene silencing coupled with microarray screening and systematic pathway analysis to obtain insights into the pathways controlled by the target genes. we found that znf <dig> regulated the expression of a large group of genes involved in regulation of kinase activity, angiogenesis, brain development and response to dna damage. our analysis reveals that znf <dig> is a pleiotropic factor in hematopoiesis, brain development, and human cancers. our approach can be used in functional genomics to elucidate the role of other transcription factors.
