BACKGROUND
retroposition entails a process in which rna  is subsequently reverse-transcribed into cdna and inserted into a new locus on the chromosome to form a new retrocopy locus. the main characteristic of the retrocopy is the lack of introns, and if the retroposition event is recent enough, a poly tail and short flanking duplicate sequences can be observed as well <cit> . retrocopies often become processed pseudogenes  and are eventually deleted because they do not have the regulatory elements necessary for expression. however, the extensive structural changes in retrocopies have been speculated as "evolutionary seeds" for the evolution of new gene functions if they acquire new regulatory sequences  <cit>  . for example, the finding of the jingwei gene in drosophila yakuba and the sphinx gene in drosophila melanogaster revealed that the retrogene can recruit a certain regulatory sequence and evolve a new function defined by new expression and new gene structure  <cit> . in the human genome, chimeric retrogenes may originate from small nuclear rnas and mrnas by rna-rna recombination  <cit> . the structures of such functional retrogenes are usually chimerical: they may either recruit a new regulatory element from the insertion site to form a peculiar coding region that evolved from difference sources  <cit> , or they can use exons from genes near the insertion site to form a new gene structure  <cit> . such chimerical structures usually confer a new function or a new expression pattern that parental genes do not have, thus often leading to adaptive evolution  <cit> . for example, retrogenes in the drosophila genome show a pattern that escaped from the × chromosome to the autochromosome to evolve new testis functions  <cit> . the e <dig> retrogene in drosophila melanogaster performs a general function and is ubiquitously expressed, while the source gene e2b is functional only in a small group of male germ cells  <cit> . these studies support the hypothesis that retrogenes played an important role in the evolution of functionality in organisms.

large numbers of retrogenes have been found in mammal, plant and insect genomes, but few retrogenes have been identified and studied in fish genomes  <cit> . the first retrogene that was reported in the fish genome was an ocular rod opsin gene, rho, which does not have introns, unlike the other intron-containing rod opsin genes in vertebrates, errlo,  <cit> . previous studies revealed that in the mammal genome, the enzymatic machinery of line <dig>  is responsible for the creation of retrogenes  <cit> . l <dig> s are widely present in mammals and account for up to about 25% of the genome  <cit> . with the sequenced zebrafish genome, many lineages of l <dig> s were identified  <cit> , therefore we predict that there may be a large amount of retrogenes in the zebrafish genome. recently, a significant number of transcribed and functional retrocopies were discovered in the primate and rodent genome  <cit> , but there has not been any study of the expressed retrocopies in the teleostei genome.

to understand the functional and evolutionary impact of retroposition in the zebrafish genome, we screened the full genome of zebrafish for retrocopies and chimerical retrogenes. we found that there are  <dig> retrocopies and  <dig> chimerical retrogenes in zebrafish genome. this is the first study conducted for retrocopies and chimerical retrogenes in teleostei genome at the whole-genome level.

RESULTS
abundant retrogenes in the zebrafish genome
the  <dig> protein sequences downloaded from the ensembl database were used to detect retrogenes in the zebrafish genome with a computational pipeline with stringent parameters depicted in the flow chart shown in figure  <dig>  all  <dig> protein sequences were mapped on the genome with tblastn  <cit> , and  <dig> longest regions mapped with the proteins were retained. nearby homology matches , which were not likely separated by introns, were merged after a series of perl scripts' parsing. the structure of the  <dig> sequences was obtained by genewise <cit> , and only  <dig> sequences with intron larger than  <dig> bp were retained. to find the parental gene, the  <dig> sequences were mapped with the whole  <dig> protein sequences with fasty <cit> , and we only kept the  <dig> results that had the best score but no overlap with the protein position on the genome. meanwhile the two sequences had more than 50% of the gene sequence's length and identified more than 50% on the amino acid level.

we only included the gene pairs of the ensembl peptides with multiple coding exon  as the best hit of the merged sequence , as these can prevent the single exon gene, e.g., olfactory receptor genes, from becoming the "parent" gene. finally, if the sequence of the new gene overlapped two exons of the parental gene and the distance between the two exons was larger than  <dig> bp, we confirmed the new gene as a retrogene. we chose  <dig> bp as a threshold based on the following: 1) the majority of introns in zebrafish genome are larger than  <dig> bp  <cit> , so it can exclude small gaps in parental genes annotated as introns by mistake; and 2) we ensured that at least one intron was lost in the new retrogene since  <dig> bp is larger than the gap size  we used in the merging step. ultimately,  <dig>  retrogene candidates were found that satisfied all our criteria. to divide these candidates into primary retrogenes and duplicates that descend from primary retrogenes, we used the genewise  <cit>  to determine whether the lost intron is derived from the parental gene. this produced  <dig> primary retrogenes, out of which  <dig> retrocopies with either frame-shift mutations or premature stop codons were defined as retropseudogenes. the rest of the retrogenes  were defined as intact retrogenes. . actually, the number of primary retrogenes is most likely higher than this sample set, because some intronless copy could have originated through retroposition of old retrogenes.

to obtain the age distribution of all the retrocopy formation events, we plotted the ks distribution of the parental-retrocopy pairs . based on the divergence time of danio rerio and cyprinus carpio of  <dig> mya   <cit> , we used  <dig> pairs of orthologs between the two fishes, and found that the synonymous substitution rate of zebrafish genes is  <dig> ×10- <dig> substitution per silent site per year. we found that the majority of retrocopies formed within the past  <dig> million years, indicating that recent, rapid formation of retrocopies may not have only occurred in primate lineages  <cit> .

large amount of transcribed retroposed genes in the zebrafish genome
generally, retrocopies were thought of as sequences without transcriptional ability, but many transcribed retrogenes were found in the primate and rodent genomes  <cit> . to explore whether this pattern exists in the zebrafish genome, we used ests to represent the transcription ability of these retrogenes, because they provide better discrimination within close paralogs than short-tag expression sequences or data from hybridization-based methods  <cit> . to map ests to the retrogenes, we used the rigorous pipeline of vinckenbosch et al.  that excludes erroneous mapping to parental genes or other paralogs . these analyses showed that about two-thirds of retrocopies  matched with at least one est, revealing that the majority of retrogenes are transcribed.  this proportion is much higher than that in human genome . this might be because the retropseudogenes were about 84% of all the retrogenes , but the expression of the retropseudogenes in human genome  is much lower than in zebrafish genome  <cit> .

we investigated how the new retrogenes recruited new regulatory sequences. we fully screened the genomic context of retrogenes to explore the potential donors of the regulatory elements. we first compared the number of transcribed retrogenes located inside and outside of other genes. in the  <dig> intact retrogenes, we found that  <dig> were inserted into "host" genes and  <dig> between the two previous existing genes. among the  <dig> retrogenes within a gene,  <dig>  had at least one est, suggesting they recruited the regulatory sequences from parental genes. interestingly, this proportion of  <dig> % was higher than the proportion of transcribed intergenic retrogenes , indicating the retrogenes inserted inside a gene were more likely transcribed as a consequence of recruitment of a cis-regulatory element from the host gene.

for the retrogenes that were located outside a gene, we hypothesized that these retrogenes were transcribed because they were inserted into a genomic region that contained a transcriptionally more active region with more potentially active regulatory sequences. such a retrosequence would be more easily to pick up regulatory elements. by contrast, if a retrosequence were inserted into a transcriptionally inactive genomic region with less potentially active regulatory sequences, then the retrogenes would be less likely to pick up a regulatory sequence and become processed pseudogenes. a prediction based on this hypothesis is that the regions flanking functional retrogenes would transcribe more rnas; the regions flanking processed pseudogenes would transcribe less rnas. we tested whether regions surrounding transcribed retrogenes are more active than regions surrounding transcribed silent retrogenes. we compared the number of ests mapped to the surrounding regions, in which transcribed retrogenes have more ests  than transcribed silent retrogenes , and found that the difference was statistically significant. .

most zebrafish retrogenes are very likely to be functional new genes
in the  <dig> primary zebrafish retrogenes, we only found  <dig> processed pseudogenes , which contained frame shift mutations or premature stop codons. we further tested the functionality of the rest of the  <dig>  retrogenes by using two approaches.

first, it is likely that a pseudogene without function may sometimes also be transcribed  <cit> . hence, the previous test of transcription of intact retrogenes ought to be further examined to test their functionality. we compared the transcription patterns between the  <dig> retrogenes with intact orf and  <dig> retropseudogenes. we found that the percentage of intact retrogenes with at least one est  was significantly higher than that of pseudogenes  . the more significant pattern was observed  when we used mrna as transcription evidence . these data show that intact retropseudogenes are likely expressed and functional, compared to the hypothetical processed pseudogenes. it also should be noted here that the two criteria of disabled mutations, frameshift or nonsense mutations, to annotate a processed pseudogene may be too stringent, because it has been found that some functional genes can be formed by splicing out the gene regions that harbor frameshift and nonsense mutation as new introns  <cit> .

an overview of the highly transcribed retrogenes  also offers compelling evidence for transcription as a marker of retrogene functionality . among the  <dig> most highly transcribed retrogenes, the vast majority  was intact, whereas only a small part  was pseudogenes. a similar result was obtained in an extended analysis with the  <dig> most highly transcribed retrogenes in which  <dig> of  <dig> were intact retrogenes. similarly, many retrogenes with a number of ests have been previously identified as functional genes.

second, we investigated the sequence constraint created by functionality through a comparison of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates  between retrogenes and their parental genes. generally, the evolution of pseudogenes is under neutrality, which means that the ka/ks values are larger than the ratio of genes subject to functional constraint under purifying selection, and smaller than the ratio of genes under positive selection  <cit> . this method has been widely used in identifying the functionality of genes  <cit> . we found that processed pseudogenes have much higher ka/ks values than intact retrogenes, illustrating that intact retrogenes are subjected to functional constraint. in the comparison between retrogenes with unknown constraints and parental genes that are known to be functional, a stricter criterion should be ka/ks <  <dig>  to identify functionality of the retrogenes  <cit> . we found that a ka/ks ratio of 65%  of intact retrogenes was significantly lower than  <dig> . these data suggested that the intact retrogenes are under stronger purifying selection and are likely functional. the data also suggested that the processed pseudogenes are also subject to sequence constraint, showing that some of them are either functional in splicing out the disabled mutations or have been functional but recently became pseudogenes by disabled mutations.

high proportion of chimerical genes
in contrast to rare recent chimerical retrogenes in mammalian genomes  <cit> , zebrafish retrogenes recruit not only novel regulatory elements but also new coding sequences from the insertion sites and thus give birth to many chimerical genes that translate hybrid proteins. out of the  <dig> intact zebrafish retrogenes,  <dig>  were predicted to have chimerical protein coding sequence  structures . among these cases,  <dig> retrogenes were added with a new peptide to the c terminus, another  <dig> retrogenes were added with a new peptide to the n terminus, whereas in  <dig> other retrogenes, both of the n and c terminus were added with a new peptide. for example, in the retrogene ensdarp00000042310_10_38722825_ <dig>  both of the two termini were added with a new peptide, while in ensdarp00000054044_18_29188505_ <dig>  a new peptide was added to its n terminus and in ensdarp00000062080_24_39945989_ <dig>  a new peptide was added to its c terminus. furthermore, in the retrogene ensdarp00000059483_15_3816795_ <dig>  a part of the n terminus was changed to 5'utr in the new hybrid protein structure .

all of the  <dig> retrogenes above were treated as coding fusion with neighboring genes. whereas in the rest of the  <dig> retrogenes,  <dig> recruited 5' and 3'utr to form a new single exon gene and  <dig> retrogenes cover the full length of the new chimerical gene, which were thought to be de novo chimerical genes. this pattern is much different from the pattern within the human genome, which has  <dig> fusion and  <dig> de novo chimerical retrogenes <cit>  .

in the  <dig> hybrid new genes,  <dig> retrogenes overlap with the exon-intron boundary, which indicated that new splice sites were created during the evolutionary history of the retrogenes. a possible reason was that during evolution, new introns were produced in the original transcripts that included the retrogenes <cit>  or new splice sites were created from previous exon regions of the parental genes <cit> .

there was considerable expression evidence that some of the zebrafish hybrid genes might have acquired new protein functions. to further study the transcription of these hybrid genes, we used full-length mrna and est to blast against the transcript of the hybrid genes, and found that  <dig> hybrid genes have transcription evidence. combined with the est data,  <dig> chimerical retrogenes were among the top  <dig> transcribed retrogenes. the evidence above illustrated that most of the chimerical retrogenes were functional. because of the extensive structural variation, these new chimerical genes were under the evolutionary process of neofunctionalization.

to explore the rate of creation of chimerical retrogenes, we counted the ks distribution of the chimerical retrogenes that were under  <dig> . among the  <dig> retrogenes, ten of them had ks values lower than  <dig> , which means  <dig> chimerical retrogenes formed in the last  <dig> million years, a rate that is  <dig> times faster than the rate of  <dig>  chimerical retrogenes per million years in the evolution of the primate lineage toward humans  <cit> . if we extended the time to  <dig> million years,  <dig> chimerical genes were found and the rate,  <dig>  genes per million years, is still about  <dig> times faster than that found in human. this is among the most rapid rates of generation of chimerical genes, just next to the rice  <cit> .

to know the generation rate of chimerical retrogenes, we plotted the ks distribution of retrogenes whose ks was smaller than  <dig> . combined with the synonymous substitution rate of zebrafish genes, our results suggest that the formation of many chimerical retrogenes occurred at a remarkably rapid evolutionary rate, much faster than that of the primate lineage.

discussion
retrogenes have been seen as evolutionary dead ends with little functional significance for a long time because of their low survival rate  <cit> . however, when analyzing the zebrafish genome, we found that retroposition was involved in producing a large number of new functional genes. in combining est with full-length mrna information, we found some of the new genes might have evolved new functionality during the evolutionary history after the insertion of retrogenes. we used the transcription information and values of ka/ks as indicators to testify to the functionality of these retrogenes, and found that a large proportion of retrogenes are transcribed, a finding that might indicate their functionality.

in this study, we have found that the transcription of retrogenes is not accidental by using a targeted approach. our data indicate that retrogene transcription is very common and the transcriptional pattern of zebrafish has been profoundly influenced by natural selection. the finding of a large amount of retrogene transcription is consistent with the fact that a large number of retrogenes are functional  <cit> . meanwhile, we found the regulatory sources for the transcriptional activity of retrogenes. some of retrogenes seem to depend on the regulatory sequences of other genes, for example, by recruiting the regulatory sequences of neighboring gene or even directly fusing to host gene. moreover, some retrogenes used the regulatory sequences of its own sequences. thus, we predicted that the regions surrounding the position of the inserted retrogenes can influence the expression of the retrogene, and the chimerical retrogene itself can form new gene structure by recruiting new splicing sites.

the ratio of intact retrogenes is very different with that of the human genome, in which intact retrogenes are only a small proportion  <cit>  and which are the result of a burst of young retrogenes in mammal genomes  <cit> . one reason may be that although there are many more kinds of line- <dig> in zebrafish than in human, but the total number of line- <dig> is less than that in the human genome  <cit> . another reason might be that the evolutionary rate in teleostei is faster than in mammals  <cit> , which makes the pseudogene inserts experience quick turnover . so, the retropseudogenes with frameshift mutations or premature stop codons are a smaller proportion in zebrafish than in the human genome  <cit> .

chimerical retrogenes have been reported in many species and are considered to be a very important component of protein diversity  <cit> . recent studies have uncovered several young chimerical retrogene in primates , in drosophila  and in rice, which improves understanding of the molecular process of generating chimerical retrogenes. the systemic search of chimerical retrogenes in our study illustrates that their formation is driven not only by the merging of retrogene and by existing unrelated regions but also from inside the retrogene.

our results suggest that many new chimerical retrogenes may have originated in zebrafish at a remarkably rapid evolutionary rate  <dig> times faster than the evolution of the primate lineage toward humans. this tentative estimate represents a lower bound for two reasons. first, we only searched the intact retrocopies for the chimerical genes, although new chimerical genes may have emerged from truncated coding regions  <cit> . it is also known that new splicing signals in a coding region that contains premature stop codons or frameshifts may evolve to form a new intron or to generate chimerical genes with "host" genes  <cit> . second, duplicated "retropseudogenes" may play functional roles by means of their rna regulating closely related paralogous genes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
to examine the birth of these putative retrogenes, we have developed a stringent pipeline for the annotation of retrogenes and retropseudogenes in the zebrafish genome, from which we obtained  <dig> retrocopies. by using the est and mrna as expression evidence, we found that the majority of retrocopies were transcribed. combined with the evolutionary analysis, we predicted that many retrocopies were functional genes. in addition,  <dig> retrogenes have recruited new exons or sequences from flanking regions; generating large numbers of chimerical genes, suggesting that gene origination through retroposition is ongoing, with a rate  <dig> times faster than the rate in humans. this indicates that the functional retrogenes have kept the zebrafish genome in constant flux. in addition retrogenes play an important role in the genome evolution and the retrotransposition provides a strong force for the adaption and speciation of the teleostei fish.
