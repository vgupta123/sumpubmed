BACKGROUND
artemisia is a diverse and economically important genus belonging to the family asteraceae, with over  <dig> species  <cit> . this genus is a source of valuable secondary metabolites and essential oils used in the treatment of various diseases  <cit> . phenols in general and flavonoids in particular are one of the most important groups of phytochemicals in plants, affecting oxidative stability, appearance, taste and odor. the biological properties shown by these compounds include antioxidant, anti-cancer and anti-aging effects, as well as protection against different heart and immune diseases and brain dysfunction caused by parkinson’s, alzheimer’s and huntington’s diseases  <cit> .

flavonoid biosynthesis starts with the amino acid l-phenylalanine  <cit>  and leads to the formation of 4-coumaroyl coa by the phenylproponoid pathway  <cit> . the key enzyme of this pathway is phenylalanine ammonia-lyase   <cit> , others being cinnamate 4-hydroxylase  and 4-coumarate: coa ligase   <cit> . chalcone synthase , which catalyzes the first committed step of the flavonoid pathway, is involved in the production of naringenin chalcone by combining one coumaroyl coa molecule with three malonyl coa molecules. chalcone isomerase  further isomerizes the chalcone to flavanone and from this step onward the pathway diverges to form diverse classes of flavonoids .fig.  <dig> flavonoids biosynthetic pathway  <cit> 



the artemisia genus is a particularly rich source of flavonoids  <cit> . while a. annua is the most extensively studied species, resulting in the isolation of around  <dig> flavonoids, these antioxidants have also been detected in other species, including a. absinthium l  <cit> , a. asiatica  <cit> , a. herba-alb  <cit> . however, the flavonoid concentration is usually very low and highly variable, not only among different chemotypes but also in the same plant at different growth stages  <cit> .

among different strategies used to improve plant secondary metabolite production, recombinant dna technology has allowed the expression of biosynthetic genes to be altered, and the manipulation of metabolic traits  <cit> . several studies show that rol genes are powerful activators of secondary metabolism in various plants  <cit> . protein of the rol a gene binds to dna and stimulates growth, whereas the rol b gene is involved in the regulation of the auxin signal transduction pathway  <cit>  and is a potent inducer of plant secondary metabolism, increasing the resveratrol production in vitis amurensis  <cit>  and anthraquinones in rubia cardifolia  <cit> . the rol c gene encodes cytokinin glucosidase and stimulates the production of many secondary compounds in various plants .

in previous work, we obtained rol b and rol c transformants of a. carvivolia buch with a high yield of antimalarial compounds as well as higher transcript levels of biosynthetic genes than the wild-type plant  <cit> . the objective of the current study was to enhance the content of flavonoids in artemisia carvifolia buch transgenics after their detection in the wild-type plant. we carried out real time qpcr analysis of flavonoid biosynthetic genes to find a relationship between their expression levels and metabolite concentration. in this regard, two genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway of flavonoid biosynthesis were studied: those encoding pal and chs. the flavonoids were quantified by hplc, and antioxidant activity was measured by performing different antioxidant assays.

RESULTS
hplc-dad-based quantification of flavonoids
qualitative and quantitative analysis of flavonoids in shoots of wild-type and transformed a. carvifolia plants  was carried out using an hplc-dad system. eight flavonoid markers  were studied, out of which four  were detected in the wild-type plant and with an enhanced concentration in the rol gene transformants. catechin and apigenin were detected in the transformed but not the wild-type plants .fig.  <dig> comparative and statistical analysis of flavonoids. each value is the mean of three replicates. any two means having a common alphabet are not significantly different at p =  <dig>  using lsd. vertical bar represents the standard error of the  <dig> means. wt = wild-type plant, tb1-tb4 = rol b transgenics, tc1-tc3 = rol c gene transgenics



while the concentration of caffeic acid was 30 μg/g dw in the wild-type plant, in the rol b transformants it reached 70 μg/g dw, showing a  <dig> -fold increase, and in rol c transformants 60 μg/g dw, showing a 2-fold increase. these concentrations, and those of the following flavonoids, are the average values. the concentration of quercetin was 10 μg/g dw in the wild-type plant, increasing up to 6-fold to 59 μg/g dw in the rol b transgenics and 4-fold to 40 μg/g dw in rol c transgenics. the wild-type concentration of isoquercetin was 400 μg/g dw, increasing  <dig> -fold to 770 μg/g dw in rol b transformants and  <dig> -fold to 660 μg/g dw in rol c gene transformants. the concentration of rutin in the wild-type plant was 300 μg/g dw, increasing up to  <dig> -fold to 720 μg/g dw in rol b transformants and  <dig> -fold to 570 μg/g dw in rol c transformants.

catechin and apigenin were detected in the transformed but not in the wild-type plants. in rol b and rol c transformants the concentration of catechin was 75 μg/g dw and 60 μg/g dw, respectively, and that of apigenin 42 μg/g dw and 30 μg/g dw, respectively. thus, the production levels of the studied compounds in wild-type a. carvifolia showed a highly significant statistical difference  in comparison with the rol b and rol c transgenics .table  <dig> analysis of variance for factors effecting the production of flavonoids in transgenics of rol b and rol c genes

polyphenols or flavonoids have been previously detected in different artemisia species, as mentioned in the introduction, but in far less quantity. rol abc genes are known to be reliable enhancers of secondary metabolite production . the effects of individual rol genes from the tl-dna of a. rhizogenes, a <dig> strain, on ginsenoside production in p. ginseng cell cultures has been reported, with rol c cultures accumulating  <dig> –3-fold more ginsenoside than the control plant, while rol b lines were not more productive  <cit> . however, another study found that anthraquinone production increased in rubia cardifolia when transformed with the rol b gene. several reports describe the mechanism of action of the rol b gene  <cit> . kiani et al.  observed increased flavonoid and phenolic content in a. dubia after transformation with a rol abc gene construct  <cit> .

expression of flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes through real time qpcr
significant changes in the expression of flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes  were observed in rol gene transgenics compared to untransformed plants . the qpcr analysis clearly showed that both target genes were significantly more highly expressed  in the transformed plants, particularly pal. increased gene expression in rol b transformants was 8–21-fold for pal versus 3–6-fold for chs. among all the rol b transgenic lines, tb <dig> with two integrated copies of the rol b gene showed the highest expression of both pal and chs. similarly, in rol c transformants expression was 10–19-fold higher for pal and 3– <dig> -fold higher for chs, reaching a maximum in line tc <dig>  harboring two copies of the rol c gene.fig.  <dig> relative expression of flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes: relative expression of flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes pal  and chs  in wild-type a. carvifolia and rol b and rol c transgenics. wt = wild-type plant, tb1-tb4 = rol b transgenics, tc1-tc3 = rol c gene transgenics



it has previously been described that the pal enzyme catalyzes the flux of primary metabolites into the biosynthetic pathway of flavonoids through the phenylpropanoid pathway and hence performs a key role in flavonoid biosynthesis  <cit> . chs, the first enzyme of the flavonoid pathway, is an acyltransferase catalyzing the condensation of 4-coumaroyl coa to the first flavonoid, naringenin chalcone, which is reported to be a rate-limiting step in flavonoid biosynthesis in different plants  <cit> . in walnut, chs is expressed more in leaves and buds than in liber and bark and is absent from wood and medulla  <cit> . various reports describe that expression of pal and chs is directly related to the accumulation of flavonoids in the plant tissue  <cit> . in the current study, a positive correlation was found in the studied flavonoid accumulation and expression of the pal and chs genes, in agreement with previous reports  <cit> . other studies have also demonstrated that the overexpression of structural flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes, including pal and chs, is related to an increased flavonoid accumulation pattern  <cit> .

evaluation of the antioxidant potential of wild-type a. carvifolia and rol gene transgenics
to assess the antioxidant potential of the transformed and untransformed a. carvifolia plants, different antioxidant assays were performed. total antioxidant capacity, measured as the equivalent of ascorbic acid , was  <dig>  %  in the wild-type plant, compared to  <dig>  % in rol b and  <dig>  % in rol c gene transformants. total reducing power was also enhanced in the transgenics, being up to  <dig>  % for rol b and 3 % for rol c, compared with 2 % in the wild-type plant . likewise, transformed plants showed lower ic <dig> values for anti-lipid peroxidation  and dpph free radical scavenging activity ; they were also more active in protecting the dna against free hydroxyl radical-induced damage . rol genes showed highly significant effect i.e. p =  <dig>  on the antioxidant potential of the plant under study . all these findings suggest that the integration of the rol b and rol c genes enhanced the antioxidant potential of the respective transgenic lines.fig.  <dig> antioxidant capacities of wild-type a. carvifolia and rol b and rol c transgenics. comparison of wild-type a. carvifolia with transgenics of rol b and rol c genes for total reducing power and total antioxidant capacity , ic <dig> for antilipid peroxidation assay  and dpph free radical scavenging assay . error bars indicate the s.e. of triplicates. statistical significance was measured by t-test . wt = wild-type plant, tb1-tb4 = rol b transgenics, tc1-tc3 = rol c gene transgenics

oxidative stress is considered the root cause of the pathogenesis of many diseases, and antioxidants can be an effective treatment  <cit> . the study of antioxidant-containing plant extracts provides insight into the mechanisms of action responsible for plant defense against oxidative damage, as well as identifying the specific antioxidant constituents  <cit> . the current study demonstrates that methanolic extracts of a. carvifolia have significant antioxidant properties.

polyphenols are major plant antioxidants due to their redox capacity  <cit> . they play an important role in neutralizing or quenching free radicals and decomposing peroxides  <cit> . dpph is an organic radical widely used in analyzing the antioxidant potential of pure compounds and plant extracts  <cit> . the reaction between the antioxidant and dpph mainly depends on the hydrogen-donating ability, and therefore the structural confirmation, of the former  <cit> . the reducing power of any compound or plant extract is in fact its potential to transfer electrons, which indicates its antioxidant capacity  <cit> . the ferric reducing power assay is used to evaluate the antioxidant potential of dietary polyphenols  <cit> . the reducing capacity shown by plant extracts indicates their antioxidant activity  <cit> .

the antioxidant properties of methanolic extracts of artemisia species have been correlated with their phenolic and flavonoid content  <cit> . experiments have been performed to understand the relationship between secondary metabolism activation and reactive oxygen species production  in r. cardifolia transformed with the rol b  <cit>  and rol c genes  <cit> . a significant reduction in intracellular ros level was observed in the transformed cells of r. cardifolia, thus indicating that the rol b and rol c genes are potential suppressors of ros. this decrease in ros was also accompanied by the enhanced expression of genes encoding ros detoxifying enzymes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
it can be concluded from the results that rol genes are effective in increasing flavonoid levels of a. carvifolia buch, as confirmed by the hplc-dad analysis and enhanced antioxidant potential of rol gene transformants. the transgenic plants also had higher transcript levels of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis than the wild-type plants, which was in accordance with their higher flavonoid content. the rol b gene was more effective than the rol c gene in promoting secondary metabolism in a. carvifolia buch.
