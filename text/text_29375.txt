BACKGROUND
isoprenoids contribute to a myriad of essential biological functions, for example as the prenyl groups that anchor proteins to membranes, as components of respiratory membranes, enzyme cofactors, and as scaffolds for the assembly of glycan structures  <cit> . two distinct biosynthetic routes supply the universal isoprenoid-precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. the mevalonate  pathway is present in animals, fungi and archaea while the 2c-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate  pathway is widely distributed in bacteria, algae and several apicomplexan parasites, including plasmodium species responsible for malaria  <cit> . both mva and mep pathways occur in plants; the former operates in the cytoplasm and the latter in chloroplasts  <cit> . in most apicomplexan parasites the components of the mep pathway are localized to an organelle known as the apicoplast, a relict chloroplast, which is also responsible for additional biosynthetic processes  <cit> . the organelle, which resembles a cyanobacterium is thought to have been acquired from an ancestral endosymbiotic event with an alga. all mep pathway enzymes in p. falciparum are synthesized in the cytoplasm but they carry an apicoplast targeting sequence, which then drives localization  <cit> . the disruption of apicoplast replication results in parasites that are isopentenyl pyrophosphate auxotrophs  <cit> .

part of the interest in the mep pathway concerns antimicrobial drug research and several observations support the idea that the pathway contains potential drug targets, enzymes whose inhibition may provide broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity  <cit> . we identified the zn2+-dependent 2c-methyl-d-erythritol- <dig> -cyclodiphosphate synthase  the fifth enzyme in the pathway as a target of interest. this enzyme, also known as ispf, catalyzes the conversion of 4-diphosphocytidyl-2c-methyl-d-erythritol-2-phosphate  to 2c-methyl-d-erythritol- <dig> -cyclodiphosphate  and cytidine monophosphate . we considered a diverse set of criteria that have been established as key with respect to target assessment for early stage antimicrobial drug discovery  <cit> . these criteria include genetic and chemical validation of the target, and the availability of accurate structural information and appropriate reagents to guide the development of structure-activity relationships. three primary factors were taken into consideration. first, genetic methods have identified that individual components of the pathway, including ispf are essential for bacterial survival. for example, the essentiality of the ispf gene for growth and survival of bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli and mycobacterium tuberculosis is established  <cit> . secondly, this pathway is absent from humans  <cit>  potentially mitigating against toxicity issues. thirdly, chemical validation of the pathway is provided by the antibacterial fosmidomycin, a potent inhibitor of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase, an enzyme that contributes to an early stage in the pathway. this last point regarding validation is reinforced by further work, which shows that fosmidomycin and derivatives are also efficacious in killing p. falciparum <cit> .

previous studies have provided insight into aspects of ispf structure, specificity, and mechanism  <cit> . the structure of ispf has been derived from a dozen species in addition to the two new ones disclosed in this publication. more recently new ispf ligands including potent inhibitors have been identified  <cit> , some of which have also been shown to inhibit the growth of p. falciparum within infected erythrocytes with respectable ic <dig> values of  <dig> - <dig>  μm  <cit> . these approaches have been complemented by nmr-based fragment screening and co-crystallization efforts targeting ispf from b. pseudomallei   <cit> .

aims
we sought to further inform the assessment of ispf as a drug target with crystallographic studies of the enzyme from two serious human pathogens, the gram-negative bacterium burkholderia cenocepacia  and the parasitic protozoan plasmodium falciparum .

RESULTS
the structure of ispf
efficient recombinant protein production systems, purification protocols and reproducible crystallization conditions have been established for bcispf and pfispf leading to yields of up to 25 mg l- <dig> and  <dig>  mg l-1of e. coli culture respectively. high-resolution crystal structures of bcispf in complex with cmp or citrate, and of pfispf in complex with cdp, as well as an unliganded pfispf structure have been determined. crystallographic statistics are presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>

the calculated masses of the bcispf and pfispf subunits are  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda respectively and the polypeptide folds into a single α/β domain that consists of a four-stranded mixed β-sheet on one side with three α-helices on the other . ispf forms a stable homotrimer as observed in size-exclusion chromatography, which returns an estimate of 60 kda for each. in all ispf crystal structures three subunits form a compact bell-shaped assembly approximately 45 Å by 60 Å in the axial and equatorial dimensions respectively . a surface area approximately equivalent to that of one subunit is buried on oligomerization. the accessible surface area  of an ispf monomer averages out as approximately 8130 Å <dig> for bcispf and 8680 Å <dig> for pfispf. the asa for the bcispf trimer is 16080 Å <dig>  and for the pfispf trimer 18180 Å <dig>  in the case of bcispf the asymmetric unit consists of three subunits, chains a, b, c, which are related by three-fold non-crystallographic symmetry . ncs is high with least squares overlays of 161cα positions in the range  <dig>  -  <dig>  Å. one subunit is present in the asymmetric unit of pfispf and the trimer is generated by the symmetry operations  and . a least squares superimposition of cα positions from both pfispf structures matches all  <dig> residues with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å. since there are no pronounced differences between the cdp bound and unliganded pfispf structures only the former is discussed.

structural comparisons of ispf orthologues from the protein data bank  were carried out using the dali server  <cit> . pairwise sequence identities range from  <dig> to 90%, z scores from  <dig> to  <dig> and rmsd values from  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å. the apicoplast targeting sequence of plasmodium spp. and the chloroplast targeting sequence of arabidopsis thaliana ispf were excluded in the calculation of sequence identities. using representative ispf structures from each of the twelve unique organisms in the pdb, an average rmsd of cα positions was calculated against both proteins. the mean of the average rmsd was  <dig>  Å and therefore the comparisons are indicative of an enzyme that has a highly conserved structure.

the two ispf variants studied here, with sequence identity of 38%, a dali z score  <dig> and rmsd value typically around  <dig>  Å, can be taken to represent a comparison of structures that are amongst the most divergent. a structure-based sequence alignment of bcispf with pfispf is shown in figure  <dig> and this, together with comparisons based on consideration of  <dig> ispf sequences, provides a context in which to discuss key features. pfispf contains a  <dig> residue insertion at the n-terminus, lys <dig> - glu <dig>  immediately after β <dig> that does not align with bacterial ispf sequences. here, residues tyr <dig> - phe <dig> could not be modeled due to the lack of ordered electron density .

the most similar structures of each new ispf structure were noted. bcispf aligns  <dig> residues with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å to bpispf . pfispf aligns 143cα positions with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å, and  <dig> residues with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å with subunits of the enzyme from p. vivax  and a. thaliana  respectively. the pvispf structure at  <dig>  Å resolution was deposited in the pdb without an associated publication . although zn2+ has been modeled at the active site , the corresponding b-factor of 119 Å <dig> is  <dig>  times greater than the average b-factor of the protein atoms, 46 Å <dig>  and the side chain of a coordinating histidine, his <dig>  is poorly oriented. we conclude that a water molecule may be a more likely occupant of this metal binding site. in contrast, in our structure of a plasmodium ispf, which is at  <dig>  Å resolution, the b-value for zn2+ of 20 Å <dig> is lower than the average b-factor over all the protein atoms of 29 Å <dig> 

the enzyme active site is located in a cleft at the interface of two subunits  and here zn2+ is coordinated by the side chains of two histidines and an aspartate  <cit> . the coordinating residues are asp <dig>  his <dig> and his <dig> in bcispf, asp <dig>  his <dig> and his <dig> in pfispf . these residues are strictly conserved in ispf. in the e. coli enzyme  glu <dig>  helps coordinate either a mg2+ or mn2+ together with the bridging phosphates of the substrate or cdp  <cit> . although the residue is conserved as glu137/ <dig>  we do not observe any cation binding here. in 81% of ispf sequences a glutamate is observed at this position, and this is conservatively replaced by aspartate in a further 18%.

the highly conserved histidine and serine combination  located on the loop that leads to α <dig>  adjacent to the zn2+ binding site , display elevated b-factors in all structures and in one chain of the bcispf:cmp complex the electron density was of insufficient quality to allow the region to be modelled, indicating a degree of flexibility. electron density is absent or poorly defined for the loop linking α <dig> to α <dig> in many of the ispf structures. this segment occurs at one side of the active site  and . this α <dig> - α <dig> loop could be modeled in the bcispf:2cmp complex although the residues have elevated b-factors , compared to the average b-value for the entire protein . the same loop was also modelled for chain a in the bcispf-citrate complex. these observations are consistent with the inference that the α <dig> - α <dig> loop on one side of the active site is flexible  <cit> .

a hydrophobic cavity occurs at the core of the ispf trimer. in bcispf the cavity is lined by the side chains of tyr <dig>  val <dig>  ile <dig> and tyr <dig>  and the floor of the cavity is formed by a ring of six hydrophobic residues, val <dig> and leu <dig> donated by all three subunits. similarly in pfispf side chains of tyr <dig>  ile <dig>  ile <dig> and val <dig> line this cavity, and the side chains of phe <dig> form the floor of the cavity. anions such as sulfate, phosphate or pyrophosphate bind at the entrance to this cavity in several ispf structures, for example phosphate is present in atispf  <cit> . in the structure of bcispf crystallized with 2so <dig> as a precipitant, a sulfate is bound by the side chain of arg <dig>  in pfispf, a sulfate binds close to this site but dislodged such that anion coordination involves the main chain amides of nearby residues, val <dig> from all three subunits, rather than a basic side chain. when bcispf is crystallized in the presence of na2hpo <dig>  tyr <dig> amide groups bind a phosphate in a similar fashion. isoprenoid-species such as geranyl- or farnesyl-pyrophosphate have been observed in the central cavity of some ispf trimers and a possible role in feedback regulation has been suggested  <cit> . a molecule of diether; a likely decomposition product or impurity of peg  <dig> used in crystallization, occupies the cavity in the bcispf:2cmp structure , possibly mimicking a prenyl chain. a solvated mg2+ with octahedral coordination is present in the cavity of the bcispf:cmp structure forming interactions similar to those observed in the structure of ispf from b. pseudomallei <cit> , data not shown.

complexes with cmp and cdp
residues from both subunits interact with and position cytidine nucleotides in the active site. these compounds constitute fragments of the substrate and provide clues about aspects of molecular recognition. the structure-based sequence alignment  and overlay of the active sites of bcispf:cmp and pfispf:cdp complexes  indicate that the key enzyme-ligand interactions and aspects of the structure that are implicated in substrate specificity and the mechanism are highly conserved. note that in the pfispf:cdp complex two conformers of cdp are present that differ in the orientation of the β-phosphate group. these refined satisfactorily at occupancy levels of  <dig>  and  <dig> .

in bcispf, carbonyl groups from ala <dig> and cis-pro <dig> accept hydrogen bonds donated by cytosine n <dig>  and the amide groups of leu <dig> and ala <dig> donate hydrogen bonds to cytosine n <dig> and o <dig> respectively. the ribose o2’ forms a hydrogen bond with asp <dig> from the adjacent subunit while the amide of gly <dig>  also from the adjacent subunit, hydrogen bonds to the ribose o3’. thr <dig> amide and side chain hydroxyl groups form hydrogen bonds to the α-phosphate. lys <dig> nz interacts with the cmp α-phosphate, and may contribute to catalysis by helping to position the transition-state intermediate or, in conjunction with zn2+, to align the substrate for nucleophilic attack. this interaction in bcispf is reminiscent of that previously reported for the active site lys <dig> in thermus thermophilus ispf  <cit> , except that in that case the lysine interacts with the β-phosphate. the side chain of lys <dig> is positioned over the cytosine and contributes van der waals contacts to stabilize the ligand pose. for clarity this residue is omitted in figure  <dig> 

we analysed the levels of conservation of these eight ispf residues detailed as interacting with cmp or cdp. the residues for which the side chain is key, the glycine and cis-proline are highly conserved in ispf, at greater than 95%. where main chain functional groups are used the nature of the side chain is less important and the level of conservation drops to 37% for the equivalent of leu <dig> to 62% for ala <dig> in bcispf. lys <dig> is anomalous. this is only lysine in 20% of the sequences and is more often a threonine, 76% of sequences. presumably the reduction in size allows space that a water molecule could occupy to help facilitate substrate binding.

surprisingly, a second molecule of cmp was observed in the active site when bcispf was co-crystallized in the presence of 10 mm ligand. this second cmp is likely due to the high concentration used and represents an artifact of crystallization, unlikely to have physiological significance. this new cytidine-binding site is referred to as position  <dig> and residues that bind this ligand are from the same subunit that binds the active site zn2+, indeed the cmp  <dig> phosphate coordinates the metal ion . the binding of cmp  <dig> within the three active sites of the asymmetric unit is very similar, for example the main chain conformation of the α2-α <dig> loop and the positions of leu <dig> and his <dig> interacting with van der waals forces on either side of the pyrimidine and helping to position it is essentially the same. in addition the position of phe <dig> that helps to position leu <dig> is also conserved. phe <dig> is strictly conserved in 96% of ispf sequences, leu <dig> in 77%. however, there are differences in the orientation of two side chains that change the detail of the hydrogen bonding interactions with cmp  <dig>  in active site a  two solvent mediated links are noted involving the carbonyl groups of ser <dig>  phe <dig> and ala <dig> and cytosine o <dig> and n <dig>  a direct hydrogen bond is formed between n <dig> and the ala <dig> carbonyl. the phe <dig> and ala <dig> carbonyl groups position a water molecule that binds cytosine n <dig> and the ala <dig> carbonyl also interacts directly with cytosine n <dig>  the carboxylate of asp <dig> binds to the ribose o2’. in the other active sites , different rotamers of ser <dig> place the side chain og to accept a hydrogen bond from n <dig> but for asp <dig> the rotamer orientations results in functional groups too distant for an interaction with the ribose. overlay with the ecispf-product complex shows that cmp  <dig> binds in the same location as mecpp  <cit>  and indeed exploits interactions with the same residues, the majority of which are conserved . specifically, in common with observations regarding recognition of the pyrimidine moiety of substrates we note that residues that use side chain functional groups to interact with ligands in the mecpp binding site are well conserved, those that use main chain groups less so. ser <dig> is strictly conserved and asp <dig> occurs in about 70% of ispf sequences but ser <dig>  phe <dig> and ala <dig> are strictly conserved in 4%, 43% and 58% respectively. the latter two residues are not conserved in pfispf, being replaced by asparagine and lysine respectively .

the binding pose of cmp  <dig> offers clues about molecular features that might be considered for ligand design targeting this area of the active site. potential ligands could, for example, aim to extend out to recreate the hydrogen bonding interactions displayed by the two ordered water molecules shown in figure  <dig>  it might also be useful to test placement of a basic component to interact with the acidic asp <dig> 

bcispf-citrate complex
attempts to produce unliganded bcispf crystals for ligand or fragment soaking experiments initially appeared to be successful and highly ordered samples were obtained. however, citrate was present in the best crystallization conditions and the electron density maps were consistent with this molecule coordinating the metal ion and therefore complicating ligand-binding studies. two binding modes were observed. citrate was well defined in one active site with an average b-factor of about 23 Å <dig>  but less so in the other two where it was modeled with occupancy  <dig>  and the average b-factors are approximately  <dig> and 43 Å <dig>  for comparison, the average b-factor for protein atoms in this structure is approximately 19 Å <dig>  the best-defined citrate  binds to the active site zn2+via both carboxylate and hydroxyl groups and this is also observed at one other site. here the citrate forms hydrogen-bonding interactions with the main chain amides of his <dig> and ser <dig>  and side chains of asp <dig> and lys <dig>  the interaction involving asp <dig> is likely a consequence of the low ph at which crystals were obtained. additional solvent mediated interactions to link citrate to the protein also occur . the normally flexible and poorly ordered α2-α <dig> loop appears to lock down over the bound citrate adopting a configuration similar to that observed in the ecispf-mecpp complex  <cit> . in the other citrate-binding pose  only a carboxylate coordinates to zn2+ but hydrogen bonds are also formed exploiting the same functional groups on the protein, the amides of his <dig> and ser <dig>  ser <dig> og, and lys <dig> nz. it is clear from these results, that any attempts to investigate ligand binding at the zn2+ site will require crystallization conditions that do not include citrate.

co-crystallization with potential zn2+ coordinating ligands
a screen of zn2+-binding ligands previously identified l-tryptophan hydroxamate as a ligand for ispf suggesting that the presence of such a group may anchor ligands in the active site  <cit> . subsequent studies with bpispf reported a number of metal ion coordinating ligands  <cit> . crystallization trials of pfispf and bcispf in the presence of several such zn2+ coordinating ligands , testing a range of concentrations together with the absence or presence of cmp were carried out. citrate was not present in these crystallization trials. numerous datasets have been measured and analyzed but we have not observed any evidence of selected ligands at the zn2+ site. in one case a  <dig>  Å resolution dataset was obtained from bcispf co-crystallized with 10 mm pyrithione. it quickly became evident that neither zn2+ nor pyrithione were present in the structure  and this suggests that the ligand may have extracted zn2+ from the active site.

CONCLUSIONS
the structures of ispf from a bacterial  and a protozoan  pathogen have been determined and compared to orthologues. a high degree of structural similarity in and around the active sites is noted. these proteins have been assessed for suitability as platforms for structure-based drug discovery. the cytidine-binding pocket is relatively rigid in ispf, whereas the pocket that binds the methylerythritol-phosphate portion of the substrate is relatively flexible. numerous attempts to obtain the structure of protein-ligand complexes failed suggesting that the crystallization conditions may need to be adjusted or alternatives found. we note that in each case high ionic strength was necessary to obtain well-ordered crystals. successful co-crystallization with small molecule ligands has been reported for ecispf and bpispf  <cit>  and given the high degree of structural similarity in the ispf active site it might be prudent to use those enzymes for early stage drug discovery studies. previously  <cit> , atispf was used as a surrogate for pfispf due to difficulties in working with the later. we also noted problems with the solubility of pfispf and subsequently identified conditions to circumvent this issue. however, given the high level of conservation we have described then any ispf might be considered a suitable surrogate for the apicomplexan enzymes. the unexpected observations that a second molecule of cmp can occupy the active site as well as the presence of citrate interacting with zn2+ in bcispf are noteworthy. these ligands provide templates for ligand design addressing metal ion coordination and interactions in the mecpp-binding pocket.
