BACKGROUND
the lignocellulose fraction of plant cell walls is the most abundant renewable carbon source on earth, and is a key resource for substituting petroleum in the production of energy, chemicals and materials. among the various types of lignocellulosic biomasses, softwood is the predominant form of land plant biomass in the northern hemisphere  <cit> . softwood  and hardwood  fiber mainly differ in the structure and composition of hemicellulose and lignin components. for instance, glucuronoxylan comprises approximately 20–30% of the secondary cell wall polysaccharides in hardwood, while galactoglucomannan is the main hemicellulose in secondary cell walls of softwood. moreover, softwoods contain mainly guaiacyl lignin, whereas hardwoods contain varying ratios of syringyl and guaiacyl lignins  <cit> . the recalcitrance of softwood lignocellulose to bioprocess technologies has been attributed to its higher lignin content, smaller pore size, and fewer hemicellulose-derived acetyl groups in comparison with hardwood  <cit> .

although relatively few organisms are known to effectively utilize all components of lignocellulose, white-rot basidiomycetes transform cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, and so are regarded as essential contributors to global carbon cycling  <cit> . while most known white-rot species, including the model fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium <cit> , have been mainly isolated from hardwoods, the white-rot basidiomycete, phanerochaete carnosa, has been isolated almost exclusively from softwoods, including abies balsamea , abies concolor , and pinus ponderosa   <cit> . previous studies have revealed differences in gene expression between p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium, suggesting that p. carnosa may possess an enzyme complement that is efficient for softwood bioconversion. for example, proteomic characterization of p. carnosa secretomes showed that p. carnosa produces a glycoside hydrolase  family  <dig> mannanase, a multicopper oxidase, and glycopeptides that likely participate in carbohydrate and lignin degradation  <cit> , which were not previously identified in proteomic analysis of p. chrysosporium <cit> . more recent transcriptomic analyses evaluated gene expression in p. carnosa grown on various softwood species , as well as a hardwood . notably, transcripts predicted to encode lignin-degrading activities  were more abundant than those predicted to encode carbohydrate-active enzymes  <cit> , which is in contrast to earlier studies of p. chrysosporium grown on wood that revealed comparatively high levels of transcripts encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes  <cit> .

key requirements for the biotransformation of particular biomass resources could be elucidated through comparative analysis of closely related lignocellulose-degrading fungi having different substrate preferences. for instance, genomic comparison of p. chrysosporium and the softwood-degrading, model brown-rot fungus, postia placenta, revealed that brown-rot is characterized by the contraction of multiple gene families, including cellobiohydrolases and cellulose-binding domains  <cit> . moreover, comparative analysis of aspergillus genomes identified correlations between genome content, plant polysaccharide degradation, and respective biotope  <cit> . given the apparent differences in substrate preference of p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium, and their phylogenetic similarity based on internal transcribed spacer  region sequences  <cit> , it is anticipated that comparative analysis of p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium genomes could reveal enzymes and metabolic pathways that are key to efficient biotransformation of recalcitrant softwood feedstocks. accordingly, the present study reports the first analysis of the p. carnosa draft genome, and compares p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium in terms of genome composition and organization, as well as growth on model and woody substrates. these analyses revealed significant expansion of p <dig> genes in p. carnosa compared to p. chrysosporium, and highlighted several differences in carbohydrate active enzymes and lignin-degrading enzymes, which may facilitate softwood utilization by p. carnosa.

RESULTS
assembly and overview of the p. carnosa genome
the net length of the p. carnosa genome sequence was  <dig>  mb, and while distributed over  <dig> scaffolds, the six largest scaffolds contained half of the total sequence and 57% of the  <dig>  predicted genes . a summary of functional annotations by several classifications is shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  of these genes, those predicted to encode p <dig> monooxygenases, mfs transporters, and signaling proteins , comprised the largest families based on pfam domains of translated sequences, and were expanded relative to other basidiomycetes . notably, the p. carnosa genome has  <dig> tandem gene duplication regions containing a total of  <dig> genes, significantly higher numbers than the p. chrysosporium genome, which contains  <dig> duplication regions with  <dig> genes. indeed, most of the top  <dig> pfam domains are expanded in p. carnosa relative to p. chrysosporium  and these are largely responsible for the differences in gene count and genome size between the two organisms.

a synteny display based on orthologous proteins in p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium revealed significant rearrangement in the evolutionary history of these two phanerochaete genomes . most of the carbohydrate- active enzymes  <cit>  were distributed across the ten largest scaffolds of the p. carnosa genome sequence. while the glycoside hydrolase  families gh <dig> and gh <dig> were enriched on scaffold_ <dig>  and the gh <dig> family was enriched on scaffold_ <dig>  most carbohydrate-active enzymes  were only loosely clustered. by contrast, six of the seven predicted manganese peroxidases  were located on scaffold_ <dig>  and three of the four predicted lignin peroxidases  were located on scaffold_ <dig> , indicating that cluster formation of mnps and lips is much tighter than that of cazymes.

a primary aim of the current analysis was to compare the genomic content of p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium, and to correlate differences with their abilities to transform various compounds, including lignocellulosic substrates. many previous reports demonstrate good correlation between genomic content and relative growth patterns on various carbon sources  <cit> . in those experiments, relative growth of a particular fungal species is determined by comparing the radius and density of the mycelia on a particular carbon source to that on d-glucose  <cit> . relative growth patterns can then be compared between fungi, since differences in colony morphology and general differences in growth rates, are taken into account  <cit> . accordingly, in addition to obtaining and analyzing the p. carnosa genome sequence, p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium were each grown in duplicate on  <dig> model carbon sources to determine how well respective genome contents correlated to relative growth measurements. similar to previous analyses, relative growth of each fungus was determined separately by comparing the radius and density of mycelia on a particular carbon source to that on d-glucose; relative growth profiles were then compared between the two species   <cit> . notably, the relative growth of p. carnosa on casein was higher than that observed for p. chrysosporium , which is consistent with the considerable expansion of proteases encoded by p. carnosa . similarly, where possible in the following sections, the growth profiles of p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium are correlated to relative occurrence of cazymes and fungal oxidative lignin enzymes  encoded by these white-rot fungi.

carbohydrate active enzymes  and correlation to carbon catabolism
gene models encoding enzymes that were predicted to degrade, modify, or synthesize glycosidic bonds were annotated based on the cazy classification scheme   <cit> . the number of predicted cazymes encoded by p. carnosap. chrysosporium and other agaricomycotina genomes were also compared . as is usually found among wood decaying fungi, p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium encode a large repertoire of gh <dig> members . whereas the p. chrysosporium genome encodes two gh <dig> proteins that are located together on scaffold_ <dig> , p. carnosa encodes a single ortholog , which was highly expressed during growth on different wood samples .

although similar distributions of broad cazy classifications were observed, closer inspection of particular cazy families revealed notable differences between p. carnosa and p. chrysoporium . for instance, both families gh <dig> and gh <dig> encode lysozyme activity, and the absence of gh <dig> in p. carnosa appeared to be compensated by a gain of a gh <dig> enzyme. likewise, the absence of gt <dig>  enzymes and cbm18s in p. carnosa was balanced by a gain in genes that likely encode functionally similar proteins from families gt <dig> and cbm <dig>  after family  <dig> cbms, cbm13s comprise the largest cbm family encoded by p. chrysosporium whereas p. carnosa totally lacks members from this cbm family. although sugar binding by p. chrysosporium cbm13s has not been characterized, xylooligosaccharides were shown to associate with a cbm <dig> binding domain from streptomyces lividans <cit> . families gh <dig>  gh <dig>  ce <dig>  and pl <dig> appear to have expanded in p. carnosa relative to p. chrysosporium , and contained a comparatively high fraction of proteins with relatively low identity  to orthologous proteins in p. chrysosporium . while families gh <dig> and ce <dig> include enzymes involved in hemicellulose degradation, gh <dig> includes enzymes involved in processing glycoproteins, including those found in plant cell walls  <cit> .

given the expansion of gh <dig> members in p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium , along with the role of gh <dig> enzymes in degrading glucomannan present in softwood, and proficient colony development of p. carnosa on guar gum  compared to birchwood xylan and pectin , a phylogenetic analysis of gh <dig> protein sequences was performed to determine whether p. carnosa encodes new branches within this enzyme family . this analysis identified one ortholog of p. chrysosporium β-mannanases  in p. carnosa , and revealed that phaca <dig> clusters on a neighboring branch and with an orthologous protein most similar to mannanases. three additional gh <dig> sequences  formed a branch in the protein phylogeny that lacked representation from p. chrysosporium. since phaca <dig> shares comparatively low identity  with the closest homolog in p. chrysosporium , and phaca <dig> was the only gene product from the unique phylogenetic branch that was upregulated in p. carnosa during growth on wood  <cit> , phaca <dig> and phaca <dig> might be particularly interesting to target for future biochemical characterization.

sugar transport and intracellular metabolism
in addition to the secretion of extracellular glycoside hydrolases, the ability to metabolize wood polysaccharides depends on the transport of resulting sugars and oligosaccharides, as well as intracellular conversion of these compounds.

although genes encoding major facilitator superfamily  transporters appeared to have expanded in the p. carnosa genome, a phylogenetic analysis of predicted sugar transporters encoded by p. carnosap. chrysosporium, and other fungi formed eight sequence clusters, and revealed a similar distribution of p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium proteins . a previous transcriptomic analysis of p. carnosa revealed comparatively high expression of phaca <dig> on nutrient rich medium  <cit> , while phchr <dig>  which also clusters in group iii, is upregulated in cellulose cultivations compared to glucose cultivations  <cit> . more interestingly, genes encoding four of the five group viii transport proteins were upregulated in p. carnosa grown on wood substrates . this group comprises predicted cellobiose transporters previously found in yeasts and filamentous fungi  <cit> . notably, a group viii cellodextrin transporter from n. crassa  has been biochemically characterized  <cit> , supporting that p. carnosa transporter proteins found in this group could have a role in cellobiose and/or cellodextrin uptake.

sugar metabolism by p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium was further investigated by using corresponding genome sequences to reconstruct an entire metabolic network for each organism  <cit> . gene products predicted to participate in central metabolism were then manually curated and expression levels were assigned from previous transcriptomic analyses . the results of this analysis revealed that the pentose catabolic pathway and the galacturonic acid pathway were induced in p. carnosa during growth on lignocellulosic substrates compared to nutrient medium, and that this response was accompanied by an increase in the expression of a transketolase, which catalyzes the conversion of d-xylulose-5-p to erythrose-4-phosphate in the pentose phosphate pathway. enzymes that catalyze the first step in rhamnose and galactose metabolism were also induced in p. carnosa wood cultivations  <cit> . similar trends were observed in p. chrysosporium, although it has fewer gene products in the corresponding metabolic pathways .

notably, growth studies revealed that p. carnosa grew poorly on birchwood xylan and pectin . since the pentose and the galacturonic acid catabolic pathways likely promote the metabolism of pectin and xylan-derived sugars, metabolic models predicted herein suggest that poor growth of p. carnosa on pectin and xylan substrates could result from low expression of extracellular pectinase and xylanase enzymes or sugar transporters, rather than intracellular metabolism of hydrolysis products.

enzymes for lignin degradation, and conversion of related aromatic compounds
the most evident difference in lignin-degrading activities encoded by p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium was the distribution of predicted manganese peroxidases  and lignin peroxidases    <cit> . the p. carnosa genome encodes eleven class ii peroxidases: seven manganese peroxidases  and four lignin peroxidases . by comparison, p. chrysosporium encodes five mnps and ten lips , suggesting that the two species might primarily rely on different peroxidase families for lignin decay. growth profiling demonstrated that while both fungi grew well on wheat bran containing approx. 3% lignin, p. chrysosporium grew better than p. carnosa on cotton seed pulp  , suggesting a higher ligninolytic ability for p. chrysosporium. this result is consistent with the expansion of mnps and reduction of lips in p. carnosa compared to p. chrysosporium, and the typically higher redox potential of lip oxidoreductases.

a phylogenetic tree was previously constructed to infer the relationship of class ii peroxidases from p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium, and tree topology indicated gene expansion after p. chrysosporium and p. carnosa speciation  <cit> . closer analysis of the protein phylogeny suggested that a common ancestor of p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium likely encoded three mnp genes and at least three lip genes. an analysis of intron distribution revealed the existence of up to seven conserved intron positions in the coding regions of p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium mnp genes, and up to ten conserved intron positions in the coding regions of the lips . most of these genes have lost one or two introns, suggesting a role for retrotransposition in gene expansion.

among the nine predicted multi-copper oxidases  was a conventional ferroxidase , and seven genes with high similarity  to p. chrysosporium mco <dig> : these included phaca <dig>  phaca <dig>  phaca <dig>  phaca <dig>  phaca <dig>  phaca  <dig>  phaca <dig>  which were all located on scaffold_ <dig>  two additional genes, phaca <dig> and phaca <dig>  were more closely related to p. chrysosporium mco <dig> and mco <dig>  respectively. notably, only two of these mco-encoding genes, phaca <dig>  and phaca <dig> , appear to be upregulated during growth on wood  <cit> . the predicted cellobiose dehydrogenase  and an ortholog to cir <dig>  were also up-regulated in p. carnosa during growth on wood  <cit> . as in the case of p. chrysosporiump. carnosa does not appear to encode laccases sensu stricto. however, recent work with a phanerochaete flavido-alba mco shows that some members of the ferroxidase/laccase group may in fact have laccase activity  <cit> .

various enzymes are proposed to supply the h2o <dig> required for oxidase activity, the best established of which is glyoxal oxidase . the p. carnosa genome contains one glox gene  and five related copper radical oxidases , compared to one glox and six related cro in p. chrysosporium . phaca <dig>  phaca <dig>  and phaca <dig> were most closely related to cro1cro <dig>  and cro <dig> of p. chrysosporium , respectively. both phaca <dig> and phaca <dig> were similar to cro3cro <dig>  and cro <dig>  and contain repeated wsc domains of unknown function. these two wsc-containing cros are found within the lip physical gene cluster on scaffold_ <dig>  notably, of the five copper radical oxidases identified here, only phaca <dig> was upregulated in p. carnosa during growth on wood  <cit> .

cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases
fungi encode a large repertoire of p <dig> genes  <cit> , and in wood-rotting basidiomycetes in particular, p450s are known to be involved in the oxidation of phenolic and non-phenolic aromatic compounds with substructures similar to those occurring in lignin and extractive compounds that otherwise inhibit microbial growth  <cit> . accordingly, the distinct lignin composition of hardwoods and softwoods, as well as the variety of extractives produced by different wood species, provoked an interest to compare p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium in terms of the p450s they encode.

the current genomic analysis revealed that p. carnosa possesses one of the largest p <dig> contingents  among the sequenced and annotated wood-rotting basidiomycetes, much higher than that of p. chrysosporium   <cit> , somewhat larger than that of the brown rot fungus p. placenta   <cit> , and higher than any of the  <dig> fungal genomes recently reported by floudas et al.  <cit> . among the large number of tandem gene duplication events in the p. carnosa genome, the largest tandemly duplicated gene family is p <dig> with  <dig> duplication regions resulting in  <dig> genes, while corresponding numbers in the p. chrysosporium genome are  <dig> and  <dig> . roughly 33% of the p <dig> genes encoded by p. carnosa appear to be tandemly duplicated. according to the phylogenetic analysis, tandem duplication of at least  <dig> p <dig> genes occurred after divergence from p. chrysosporium. for example, four tandemly duplicated genes found in scaffold  <dig>  were 80- <dig> identical, and shared roughly 60% identity with the best homolog in p. chrysosporium.

the  <dig> p450s of p. carnosa were grouped into  <dig> known p <dig> clans,  <dig> families and  <dig> subfamilies, with cyp <dig> being the largest clan with  <dig> members . in comparison to p. chrysosporium, several p <dig> clans  and many families had expanded in p. carnosa . interestingly, cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> were nearly doubled in p. carnosa and genes from these clans represented over half of the  <dig> unique p <dig> gene transcripts that were upregulated in p. carnosa wood degrading cultures .

transformation of softwood and hardwood components by p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium
the genomic analysis of p. carnosa revealed that among the most remarkable differences between this organism and p. chrysosporium was the apparent enrichment in p <dig> genes and the difference in distribution of lip and mnp genes. p. carnosa has been mainly isolated from softwood wood species, and so an interesting prospect is that growth of this organism on softwood is facilitated by the oxidative transformation of guaiacyl lignin and otherwise inhibitory wood extractives. to test this possibility, p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium were grown on heartwood and sapwood preparations from various hardwoods  and softwoods , and residual wood extractives and lignin were measured using ultra high performance liquid chromatography  and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , respectively.

uplc analyses revealed that while p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium similarly reduced the total phenolic content of sapwood samples, p. carnosa transformed a higher fraction of phenolics in most of the heartwood samples, including those from softwood species containing high initial phenolic content . interestingly, p. chrysosporium transformed a broader range of heartwood phenolics in maple than p. carnosa, and this trend was also observed albeit to a lower extent, for aspen heartwood . moreover, growth of p. chrysosporium on heartwood from softwood species was only observed in red spruce cultivations , which contained relatively low initial phenolic content. in some cases, the transformation of specific phenolic compounds by p. carnosa could also be correlated to growth. in particular, the transformation of kaempferol 3-o-β-d-glucoside and naringin in heartwood from white spruce was higher for p. carnosa than p. chrysosporium , and p. carnosa exhibited better growth on white spruce . both kaempferol 3-o-β-d-glucoside and naringin are sugar-containing phenolic compounds, where the sugar moiety can be released by gh <dig> β-glucosidase activity and gh <dig>  gh <dig> or gh <dig> α-rhamnosidase activity, respectively. since gh families  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> did not substantially differ between p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium, detoxification of the phenolic moiety of kaempferol 3-o-β-d-glucoside and naringin might have promoted the utilization of these compounds.

aspen and pine wood samples were also analyzed by ft-ir to identify differences in lignin and carbohydrate components resulting from p. carnosa or p. chrysosporium cultivation. principal component analysis  of wood ft-ir spectra in the fingerprint region  clearly separated wood samples decayed by p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium . overall, wood samples collected from p. carnosa cultivations were distinguished from control samples by a reduction in lignin ; wood samples from p. chrysosporium cultivations were further distinguished by more extensive polysaccharide degradation . notably, peak intensities at wavenumbers characteristic of cellulose absorption were reduced in heartwood pine cultivations, even though growth of p. chrysosporium was not visible on this wood sample . the decay patterns revealed by the ft-ir analysis suggest that while p. chrysosporium is known to elicit simultaneous decay of lignin and polysaccharides, p. carnosa likely elicits sequential degradation of cell wall components. these results are consistent with previous reports that illustrate comparatively high expression of genes encoding lignin-degrading activities in p. carnosa, and cellulose-degrading activities in p. chrysosporium, during growth of these fungi on various wood samples  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
an underlying hypothesis of the current study was that identifying subtle differences in the distribution and sequence of genes encoded by p. carnosa and p. chrysosporium would facilitate the discovery of candidate enzymes that promote the conversion of recalcitrant softwood feedstocks. indeed, the comparative genomic analysis of these related white-rot fungi revealed a tangible set of enzyme classes that could promote the conversion of softwood. in particular, this study revealed that the most divergent cazymes belonged to families gh <dig>  gh <dig>  ce <dig>  and pl <dig>  that the relative abundance of genes encoding mnp and lip oxidoreductases was reversed in p. carnosa compared to p. chrysosporium, and that p. carnosa encodes the largest contingent of p <dig> enzymes than any other basidiomycete characterized to date.

specific hemicellulases, particularly from family gh <dig>  were identified for future biochemical characterization. however, the clearest correlations between growth studies and differences in encoded enzymes were in regards to lignin removal and ability to transform wood extractives. while the predicted differences in the redox potential of mnp and lip was consistent with slower growth of p. carnosa on wheat bran and cotton seed pulp compared to p. chrysosporium, oxidants produced by mnp might diffuse more easily through dense lignocellulose structures than lip associated oxidants  <cit> , p. carnosa removed a higher proportion of phenolic extractives in heartwood samples of softwood than did p. chrysosporium; p. carnosa also showed better growth on these feedstocks. given the comparatively high expression of p <dig> genes from the cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> clans in p. carnosa grown on woody substrates  <cit> , an intriguing possibility is that the expansion of cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> families discovered through genome sequencing enables p. carnosa to colonize heartwood from both softwood and hardwood species. the implication of this analysis is that detoxification of wood extractives and ability to degrade dense lignin structures may be key to enhancing softwood bioconversion.
