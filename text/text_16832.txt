BACKGROUND
an increasing prevalence of infections caused by acinetobacter baumannii has been observed in the clinical setting throughout the last  <dig> to  <dig> years  <cit> . a. baumannii is able to persist in the hospital environment and in particular intensive care units, due to its wide variety of resistance mechanisms and high survival rate on abiotic surfaces  <cit> . some clinical a. baumannii strains have been shown to be naturally competent for the uptake of genetic material, which facilitates acquisition of novel resistance and virulence genes  <cit> .

free iron is a limited micronutrient in hosts where it is typically tightly bound within a range of biomolecules, such as heme. as such, iron acquisition systems are important factors for the virulence of pathogenic organisms. bacteria can adapt to iron limited host environments through the expression of a range of iron acquisition mechanisms. one pathway for uptake of iron involves direct binding of fe2+ or heme to receptors or transport proteins on the cell surface  <cit> . a second more energy intensive mechanism of iron uptake involves the production and secretion of high-affinity iron chelating siderophores, which compete with host cells for iron  <cit> . the genes involved in the production of a siderophore are usually clustered within the genome of the producing organism. in addition to biosysnthesis genes, many of these gene clusters also encode efflux pumps with putative roles in siderophore export. transporters classified within the atp-binding cassette  superfamily, major facilitator superfamily  and resistance-nodulation-cell division  family have been associated with siderophore extrusion  <cit> . however, the ability to transport siderophores into the extracellular space has been shown for only two pumps, both mfs members. ents of escherichia coli transports enterobactin  <cit>  and ymfe of bacillus subtilis is involved in transport of bacillibactin  <cit> . inactivation of these pumps results in decreased efflux of the fully synthesized siderophore, but increased extrusion of siderophore precursor products  <cit> .

the uptake and reduction of iron-loaded ferric siderophores involves the tonb-exbb-exbd energy transduction system in combination with a ferric siderophore complex receptor  <cit> . bacteria often contain numerous ferric siderophore complex receptors. some of these are encoded within siderophore biosynthesis gene clusters and are likely to display specificity for the locally encoded siderophore. however, various other ferric siderophore receptors can be scattered throughout the genome and may have the ability to recognize exogneously produced siderophores that are structurally unrelated to endogenous siderophores  <cit> .

most a. baumannii strains have the ability to grow under iron limiting conditions, which assists in the colonization of a host, however, a diversity of iron acquisition mechanisms has been shown between different acinetobacter strains  <cit> . to date, three different siderophore biosynthesis gene clusters have been described in a. baumannii  <cit> . of these, the cluster encoding the siderophore acinetobactin has been the most extensively studied. knockout experiments have confirmed the functions of both a siderophore biosynthesis protein and receptor from the acinetobactin gene cluster  <cit> . furthermore, acinetobactin is the only siderophore produced by acinetobacter to have been structurally characterized  <cit> . a second siderophore biosynthesis gene cluster found only in a. baumannii  <dig> has been characterized using complementation experiments in an e. coli mutant strain  <cit> . finally, a putative siderophore biosynthesis gene cluster has been described in strain atcc  <dig> and subjected to limited quantitative reverse transcription pcr  analyses under iron limiting conditions  <cit> .

to comprehensively identify mechanisms of iron acquisition and low iron adaptation in a. baumannii, the affect of iron starvation on a. baumannii cells was investigated at the global level. the transcriptomic responses of a. baumannii atcc  <dig> cells to low iron conditions were examined using a whole genome microarray.

RESULTS
optimization of test conditions for transcriptomics
iron is an essential micronutrient and depletion in the growth medium is likely to have an impact on cell viability. therefore, growth of a. baumannii atcc  <dig> was investigated under varying iron concentrations to determine optimal conditions for whole transcriptome analysis. reduction of available iron in mueller-hinton  medium was achieved by supplementation of  <dig> '-dipyridyl , a synthetic iron chelator. this compound had no effect on the ph of the medium . no significant change in the growth rate of a. baumannii strain atcc  <dig> was observed after addition of  <dig> μm dip, whereas, supplementation with  <dig> μm dip resulted in a growth delay of approximately  <dig> min at mid-log phase  . moreover, the total biomass was reduced by more than 10% at stationary phase . addition of  <dig> μm dip had a major impact on growth and resulted in more than 70% biomass reduction compared to cultures under iron replete conditions during stationary phase. due to the moderate inhibitory, but non-lethal effect of  <dig> μm dip, this concentration was chosen to study transcriptional changes under iron limitation. preliminary qrt-pcr was performed to confirm transcriptional adaptation in response to iron limitation by assaying the level of transcription of the ferric uptake regulator , which is known for auto-up-regulation when iron is limited  <cit> . a. baumannii grown in the presence of  <dig> μm dip expressed fur at levels increased more than 2-fold compared to cells grown under iron replete conditions . therefore, the genome wide transcriptional changes of atcc  <dig> grown in mh medium and mh supplemented with  <dig> μm dip during mid log-phase were compared by microarray analysis.

global transcriptional changes of a. baumannii to iron starvation
iron limitation had far reaching transcriptional effects on a. baumannii cells . significance analysis  <cit>  of the microarray data showed that  <dig> genes were significantly differentially expressed under iron limiting as compared to iron replete conditions . transcript levels were more than 2-fold higher for  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> genes were up-regulated more than 4-fold . the maximum overexpression observed was 165-fold for the siderophore biosynthesis gene basd. fewer genes were down-regulated under iron limitation; only  <dig> genes were more than 2-fold underexpressed with a maximum down-regulation of 29-fold . the array results were validated by qrt-pcr analysis on a subset of differentially expressed genes . there was good correlation between data from the qrt-pcr and the microarray analyses, although the qrt-pcr data generally showed higher fold changes than the microarray expression data. the tendency for microarrays to underestimate fold changes relative to qrt-pcr is well established  <cit> .

microarray data displayed by clusters of orthologous groups  functional categories showed that 27% of the genes up-regulated under iron limited conditions encode proteins involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport and catabolism . the majority of these genes are located within three large overexpressed gene clusters, each of which is known or predicted to synthesize a siderophore . siderophore cluster  <dig>  is a novel putative siderophore gene cluster, having not been previously identified. the two other highly overexpressed siderophore clusters identified, siderophore cluster  <dig>  and the acinetobactin cluster , have been described previously  <cit> . many other overexpressed genes within this cog category encode ferric siderophore receptors, which are widely dispersed across the genome.

in addition to siderophore-related genes, a high percentage, 22%, of genes up-regulated under iron limitation, encoded proteins categorized within the defence mechanism cog. a number of these genes encode transporter proteins that are classified as defence proteins due to their predicted roles in the export of metabolic waste or other toxic compounds. interestingly, our analysis of several of these proteins, primarily those encoded within siderophore biosynthetic loci, suggested that they function in the extrusion of siderophores .

various genes related to cell motility were down-regulated when a. baumannii was grown under iron limiting conditions . these included biosynthesis genes homologous to both type iv pili and chaperone-usher pili assembly systems, or type i pili. another heavily down-regulated gene encoded a hemerythrin-like protein . various functions have been suggested for these proteins with an iron containing centre, including detoxification, transport and storage of iron and/or oxygen, or a role as a sensory protein  <cit> . the cytochrome d genes, part of the respiratory system, and 4fe-4s-ferredoxin, which facilitates electron transport in various metabolic processes, were also down-regulated more than 4-fold. the iron-dependent class i fumarate hydratase was found to be 9-fold down-regulated. in contrast, fumarase c, which belongs to the iron-independent class ii was 27-fold up-regulated, suggesting a physiological shift to the class ii protein under iron limitation . these findings correlated with results observed in a study on fumarase a  and fumarase c in the tri-carboxylic acid cycle of pseudomonas fluorescence  <cit> . in conclusion, a. baumannii showed strong transcriptional responses to iron starvation, predominantly in up-regulation of iron acquisition mechanisms. however, many genes related to other processes than iron acquisition, such as respiration and motility, were also transcriptionally affected under the conditions tested.

a. baumannii fur box optimization
bioinformatic analyses were performed to identify motifs within the promoter regions of iron responsive genes that could serve regulatory functions. the multiple em for motif elicitation  tool and the multiple alignment and search tool  were used to identify motifs and search for these motifs across the a. baumannii atcc  <dig> genome, respectively  <cit> . meme-based analyses of the upstream regions of all genes overexpressed by at least 4-fold under iron limitation identified a motif bearing strong similarity to the fur binding sites of e. coli and pseudomonas spp.  <cit> . to confirm the importance of fur in regulating iron adaptation responses in a. baumannii, a scoring matrix was created using the experimentally determined e. coli fur binding sites  <cit> . this scoring matrix was used to screen the atcc  <dig> genome using mast. hits obtained using mast, which were found upstream of genes that were more than 4-fold up-regulated in response to iron limitation and with a p-value less than 10e- <dig>  were selected for iterative refinement of the scoring matrix, until no new hits were obtained . the resulting a. baumannii fur box motif showed a  <dig> nucleotide palindromic sequence .

in a previous study, the upstream regions of fur genes from different a. baumannii isolates were aligned to obtain a motif representing the fur binding site  <cit> . some differences exist between this sequence and the fur box sequence shown in figure  <dig>  most notably, the previously described motif lacked the typical fur box palindomic structure. fur is known to auto-regulate its own expression, however, as seen in the current study, up-regulation of fur under iron limiting conditions is at lower levels than that of other fur regulated genes, e.g., siderophore biosynthesis genes, a phenomenon that could reflect a lower binding affinity of the fur protein for the fur promoter region  <cit> . therefore, the fur binding sequences found upstream of the fur gene may have predicted a less than optimal a. baumannii fur box consensus motif, which does not show the typical palindromic structure. moreover, fur motifs of different bacterial genera show a high level of homology, whereas the previously described a. baumannii fur motif is more distant.

a mast search  using the optimized a. baumannii fur motif showed  <dig> hits to the a. baumannii atcc  <dig> genome . over 80% of the genes with a well conserved fur box upstream  showed more than 2-fold up-regulation. furthermore, of the  <dig> genes up-regulated more than 4-fold under iron limiting conditions,  <dig> were preceded by putative fur binding sites. these studies highlight a significant correlation between the level of conservation of a putative fur binding site and the level of up-regulation under iron limiting conditions.

extracytoplasmic function  transcription factors are sigma- <dig> family proteins that are responsive to environmental changes such as iron starvation  <cit> . these proteins play an important role in regulating iron-uptake mechanisms in several bacterial genera. for example, one of the best characterized ecf sigma factors, pvds, controls the genes required for biosynthesis and transport of the siderophore pyoverdine in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . expression of pvds and various other sigma- <dig> factors in pseudomonas is regulated by fur  <cit> . however, in this study no predicted sigma- <dig> factors were identified in the list of genes containing a putative a. baumannii fur binding site . moreover, no significant differentially expressed sigma- <dig> factors were found under the iron limited conditions, suggesting that in acinetobacter, these proteins do not function in iron-uptake regulation. another regulatory mechanism involved in iron homeostasis includes small rna molecules, such as ryhb from e. coli or prrf from p. aeruginosa. however, sequences homologous to either of these small rnas were not found in the a. baumannii atcc  <dig> genome. nonetheless, a role for small rnas in iron homeostasis can not be ruled out, since the a. baumannii atcc  <dig> genome contains a gene encoding the rna chaperone hfq , which is required for the functionality of numerous small rnas involved in iron homeostasis in various gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . the results of this study suggest that fur is the primary regulator of iron uptake in a. baumannii.

transcriptional profiling of the siderophore mediated iron acquisition mechanisms
genes involved in the biosynthesis, efflux and uptake of a siderophore are often clustered within bacterial genomes. to date, three putative siderophore gene clusters have been identified in a. baumannii  <cit> , of which two can be found in strain atcc  <dig>  a significant finding from the microarray results was the detection of the novel putative a. baumannii siderophore gene cluster . several genes within siderophore cluster  <dig> were more than 100-fold overproduced under iron limitation, highlighting their potential importance in iron uptake . siderophore cluster  <dig> contains eight genes with a putative function in siderophore biosynthesis, a1s_ <dig>  a1s_ <dig>  a1s_1650- <dig> and a1s_ <dig>  siderophore extrusion is most likely facilitated by an mfs efflux pump . a receptor  and pepsy-associated transmembrane helix family protein  are likely to be involved in recognition and reduction of ferric siderophores, respectively. fur boxes for transcriptional regulation of the unidirectional, operon-like gene cluster could be identified upstream of a1s_ <dig> and a1s_ <dig> .

siderophore gene cluster  <dig>   <cit>  showed similarly high levels of overexpression as cluster  <dig> . this cluster contains  <dig> genes involved in siderophore biosynthesis , three genes involved in recognition and uptake of the ferric siderophore  and two genes encoding putative efflux pumps. one efflux pump gene, a1s_ <dig>  encodes a putative mfs efflux pump. as mentioned previously, members of this family have been identified in various siderophore gene clusters in other bacteria and have proven to play a role in the efflux of enterobactin  <cit> . the second efflux pump, a1s_ <dig> is a member of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion  family  <cit> . to our knowledge this is the first report of a bacterial mate pump having a putative role in siderophore efflux. similar to siderophore cluster  <dig>  fur appears to be the main transcriptional regulator, since binding sites could be identified upstream of a1s_ <dig>  a1s_ <dig> and a1s_ <dig> .

the most extensively characterized acinetobacter siderophore gene cluster is that responsible for biosynthesis of acinetobactin  <cit> . acinetobactin is synthesized from a  <dig> -dihydroxybenzoic acid, threonine and hydroxyhistamine, and contains catecholate and hydroxamate groups that provide a high affinity for iron  <cit> . the acinetobactin biosynthesis genes include basa-d, basf- j and ente . gene pair bara and barb encodes a siderophore efflux system of the abc-superfamily, the products of baua-f form a receptor for recognition of ferric acinetobactin and the products of baub-e are involved in translocation of ferric acinetobactin . all of these genes showed high levels of overexpression, ranging from 43-fold to 165-fold. the cluster contains putative fur boxes upstream of basj, ente/basd, basa/bau and baud/basd. these same fur binding sites have been experimentally identified using a fur titration assay  <cit> , validating the fur analysis described here.

interestingly, transcriptional up-regulation gradually decreased in all three siderophore clusters when distance from the fur box increased, demonstrating the importance of fur in regulating siderophore production at the level of gene transcription. this is the first time that a full transcriptional profile has been provided for the siderophore gene clusters in a. baumannii under iron limiting conditions. most importantly, a novel putative siderophore gene cluster was identified.

siderophore receptors expressed on the surface of the bacterial outer membrane play a crucial role in the recognition of iron-loaded siderophores and therefore iron uptake. these receptors are likely to recruit the tonb-exbb-exbd translocation system for transport of ferric siderophores from the extracellular space to the cytoplasm  <cit> . the a. baumannii atcc  <dig> genome contains  <dig> putative siderophore receptors. analysis demonstrated that  <dig> of these are located downstream of a putative fur box  of which  <dig> were significantly up-regulated under iron limiting conditions.

under iron limited conditions, high levels of overexpression were also determined for the tonb-exbb-exbd gene cluster  which contained a predicted fur box. previously, a second tonb-exbb-exbd energy transduction system in strain atcc  <dig>  was described  <cit> . the cluster restored enterobactin utilization in e. coli exbbd mutants, but not in tonb mutants. however, in our study, no significant transcriptional up-regulation of the genes within this cluster  was observed under iron limiting conditions. it is possible that the cluster is related to heme acquisition rather than siderophore mediated iron uptake, since genes related to hemophore utilization were located adjacent to this cluster. a heme receptor/reduction mechanism may not be required under the conditions tested in our study, since no hemophores are being synthesized by a. baumannii atcc  <dig> and no exogenous hemophores were present.

investigation of motility under iron limiting conditions
it is well established that pili play an important role in the pathogenicity of bacteria due to their roles in motility, adherence, invasion and resistance  <cit> . grouping transcriptome results from this study by cog function showed that 18% of the genes related to motility were significantly down-regulated under iron limiting conditions . the down-regulated genes from this group are part of the chaperone-usher pili assembly systems  and type iv pili that have been previously identified in a. baumannii  <cit> . homologous features have been associated with biofilm formation and motility in various organisms, including e. coli and p. aeruginosa  <cit> .

in a. baumannii, biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces has been linked to a type i pili encoded by csuab-e  <cit> . the csua/b, csua, csub and csue proteins are predicted to form part of the type i pili rod  <cit> . csuc forms a periplasmic chaperone protein that accelerates folding of the pilus rod subunits and csud is an outer membrane protein  responsible for assembly and extension of the pilus  <cit> . csud shares 40% and 45% amino acid sequence similarity with the omp of two other type i pili mechanisms in strain atcc  <dig>  a1s_ <dig> and a1s_ <dig>  respectively. csuc and homolog a1s_ <dig> were both down-regulated under iron starvation, by  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively . the csub and csue homologs within this second cluster, a1s_ <dig> and a1s_ <dig>  respectively, were also significantly down-regulated under iron limitation. there were no genes down-regulated in the third type i pili cluster . it has been shown that transcription of the csu cluster in a. baumannii is controlled by the bfmrs two-component regulator  <cit> . however, no significant differential expression was observed for either gene encoding this system in this study. biofilm assays were performed under iron replete and iron limited conditions in order to assess the impact of down-regulation of the csu cluster in the formation of these structures. however, no significant differences were observed between planktonic growth and biofilm formation under iron limiting or replete conditions . a similar study with p. aeruginosa on the effect of iron limitation on biofilm formation showed that growth as a biofilm was impaired to greater extent than planktonic growth  <cit> . interestingly, it was also shown that twitching motility was enhanced when iron was less readily available  <cit> , which could correlate with the overexpression of the type iv pili observed in moraxella catarrhalis under iron limitation  <cit> . these findings indicate that binding and adherence characteristics follow different regulatory pathways in a. baumannii.

various genes involved in the biosynthesis of type iv pili, including pilb-d, pilt, pilu, comm-o, coml, comq and genes that play a role in chemosensory and regulation of this complex, pilg-j, pilr, pils and the chpa-like, were down-regulated under iron limitation in strain atcc  <dig> . in p. aeruginosa, type iv pili have proven to play a role in swarming motility, a form of migration over nutrient rich semi-solid surfaces  <cit> . previous studies on the type iv secretion mechanism in acinetobacter have been predominantly related to its function in dna acquisition  <cit> . a swarming phenotype on luria-bertani medium containing a low percentage  of agar was determined for a. baumannii strain atcc  <dig> . the effect of iron limitation on swarming motility was investigated by supplementation of dip to the swarming medium. strain atcc  <dig> was found to be incapable of migrating over the surface of the semi-solid medium when  <dig> μm dip was supplemented in the medium, whereas non-migrational growth remained largely unchanged . since bacterial motility is a high energy consuming process, the inability to migrate may be a stress response of a. baumannii atcc  <dig> to low iron levels.

comparative analysis of the iron acquisition mechanisms of sequenced acinetobacter isolates
the iron uptake machinery encoded by different a. baumannii strains may differ, as variation in the composition of siderophore mediated iron uptake proteins in the outer-membrane has been shown in a study on different acinetobacter strains  <cit> . moreover, a siderophore gene cluster found in a. baumannii  <dig>  could not be identified in any other sequenced acinetobacter strain  <cit> . to explore this possibility in more detail comparative analyses of siderophore gene clusters were conducted using  <dig> fully sequenced acinetobacter genomes, including a. baumannii strains atcc  <dig>  atcc  <dig>  aye, ab <dig>  acicu, 307- <dig>  d <dig>  wm99c and sdf, and a. baylyi strain adp <dig> 

the novel putative siderophore cluster  <dig>  was found to be well conserved between strains atcc  <dig>  atcc  <dig>  aye, ab <dig>  acicu, 307- <dig>  d <dig> and wm99c . interestingly, the boundaries of this cluster, including genes orthologous to a1s_ <dig> and a1s_ <dig> that encode proteins with homology to the siderophore biosynthesis proteins iuca/iucc and acetyltransferase, respectively, were identified in strain sdf but the intervening genes appear to have been replaced by a  <dig>  kb transposon encoding a transposase of the is <dig> family . well over  <dig> copies of this insertion sequence are found throughout the sdf genome and, along with other insertion sequence elements, are known to have played a major role in genome reduction in this environmental a. baumannii strain  <cit> . no other putative siderophore biosynthesis gene clusters were identified in strain sdf. therefore, as a result of this insertion, this strain does not appear to encode any siderophore mediated iron acquisition mechanisms. this may be one reason that this strain has a higher requirement for soluble iron than other a. baumannii strains, as outlined below. cluster  <dig> could also be found in a. baylyi apd <dig>  however, it lacked a putative membrane protein  and acetyltransferase . instead, the adp <dig> cluster contained a putative acetyltransferase  inserted between orthologs of a1s_ <dig> and a1s_ <dig> . the putative membrane protein a1s_ <dig> is most likely involved in recognition of the chelated siderophore, however, this role could be fulfilled by other ferric siderophore receptors, encoded distally in the genome. whereas, cluster  <dig> is in the same genomic position in all a. baumannii strains, in a. baylyi adp <dig> it appears to have been subjected to genomic rearrangement as it is located in a different position.

nd = not determined

of the  <dig> acinetobacter strains surveyed, siderophore cluster  <dig> was only detected in atcc  <dig> and adp <dig>  additionally, no positive hits for a1s_ <dig>  a gene within this siderophore cluster, were identified in  <dig> clinical acinetobacter isolates from widespread locations in australia using pcr screening . therefore, this cluster appears to be relatively rare across the acinetobacter genus. the average homology between the atcc  <dig> and adp <dig> siderophore cluster  <dig> genes was 75%, which is high compared to orthologous genes elsewhere within these two genomes, e.g. 53% within siderophore cluster  <dig>  transposases were found at the termini of siderophore cluster  <dig> in both atcc  <dig> and adp <dig>  suggesting that this gene cluster may have been horizontally acquired. nonetheless, these transposases are distinct and have inserted into distinct genomic positions in the two strains, suggesting that siderophore cluster  <dig> was incorporated into the two genomes in separate transfer events. no other hits were obtained in a blastn search of the genbank database with cluster  <dig>  therefore, the origin of this cluster remains unknown.

a high level of conservation was observed for the acinetobactin gene cluster among most a. baumannii isolates . however, this cluster was not seen in the sdf and adp <dig> strains. a fifth cluster was identified by blastp searches in several sequenced a. baumannii strains  . the genes are represented in strain aye by abaye <dig> and abaye <dig>  a putative fur box could be identified upstream of abaye <dig> and high expression levels were observed under iron limiting conditions using qrt-pcr analysis . the two genes encode proteins that were found to be homologous to an isochorismatase and a  <dig> -dihydro- <dig> -hydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase. the product synthesized by these two enzymes in this cluster,  <dig> -dihydroxybenzoate, is an iron binding compound, but also a precursor component for more complex siderophores, like acinetobactin. this cluster is well conserved between strains aye, ab <dig>  acicu, 307- <dig>  atcc  <dig>  d <dig> and wm99c.

the minimum inhibitory concentration  of dip was determined for seven of the strains included in the genetic comparison . growth of a. baylyi strain adp <dig> and a. baumannii sdf was inhibited at lower levels compared to other strains. atcc  <dig> did not show higher mic values for dip compared to aye, wm99c or d <dig>  despite having three highly expressed siderophore gene clusters. therefore, viability of acinetobacter strains under varying iron concentrations does not appear to directly correlate with the presence or absence of siderophore gene clusters. strains with higher od <dig> values under iron replete conditions showed higher mic levels for dip.

a second fur-like transcription repressor
various bacterial genomes contain multiple fur-like genes. these fur homologs often encode repressors with similar domains but with higher affinity for metals other than iron, such as zinc, manganese or nickel  <cit> . the a. baumannii aye genome also encoded a second fur-like regulator that has not yet been characterized, abaye <dig>  this gene was located adjacent to the putative siderophore genes described above . conserved domain -searches showed the highest homology with cd <dig> , which can be found in fur and other metalloregulatory proteins. a putative zinc uptake regulator  can be found in a zinc-uptake gene cluster in strain aye . pairwise alignment of abaye <dig> and fur , and abaye <dig> and zur, indicated higher homology for abaye <dig> to fur than to zur, showing 46% and 33% similarity, respectively. little is known about auto-regulation of fur homologs. in the case of abaye <dig>  a fur box with a low p-value can be found less than  <dig> bp upstream of the start codon using the atcc  <dig> optimized fur motif. moreover, qrt-pcr analysis demonstrated that growth of a. baumannii aye under iron limiting conditions resulted in approximately 164-fold up-regulation of abaye <dig>  whereas, fur only showed  <dig> -fold up-regulation. this second fur-like gene can also be found in strains atcc  <dig>  d <dig> and wm99c, and a truncated form in sdf. further experimental work is required to determine if abaye <dig> plays a role in transcription of genes related to iron acquisition.

CONCLUSIONS
this study defined the global transcriptional response of a. baumannii to iron starvation. the up-regulation of three siderophore mediated iron acquisition systems was the predominant feature of this transcriptional response. the high level of overexpression of these systems under iron limitation, suggests that each is active in mediating iron uptake and therefore likely to be of importance to a. baumannii for survival in iron limited environments, such as human hosts. several genes involved in other processes, such as respiration and electron transport were also significantly differentially expressed. our data corroborate results from a recently published proteomic study of a. baumannii under iron rich and iron limiting conditions  <cit> , such as up-regulation of the iron acquisition mechanisms and fumc, and the down-regulation of fuma and ompw. the abundance of putative fur binding sites identified upstream of up-regulated genes highlighted a major role for this regulator in transcriptional up-regulation under iron limiting conditions. various genes of the type iv pili were down-regulated under iron limiting conditions. this may in fact explain the inability of strain atcc  <dig> to migrate on semi-solid surfaces under low iron concentrations. overall, the results indicated that a. baumannii is adaptable to an environment with limiting iron availability.
