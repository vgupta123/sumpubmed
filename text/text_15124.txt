BACKGROUND
the cotton bollworm, helicoverpa armigera   is the most damaging pest of cotton, grain legumes, cereals, vegetables, fruit crops, and forest trees in asia, africa, australia, and the mediterranean europe. it is a polyphagous insect that causes an estimated loss of us$ <dig> billion in different crops worldwide  <cit> . helicoverpa armigera control is currently heavily based on insecticide use, and it has developed high levels of resistance to commonly used insecticides  <cit> . to overcome this problem, transgenic crops expressing bacillus thuringiensis   toxin proteins have been deployed on a large scale for pest management worldwide, that has resulted in a considerable reduction in pesticide use and increased crop production and profitability  <cit> .

bacillus thuringiensis is a spore forming bacterium that produces crystal proteins , which are toxic to many species of insects  <cit> . in lepidoptera, specificity to bt cry toxins is due to alkaline ph of the mid gut, which is essential for conversion of protoxin to active toxin form  <cit> . however, increasing use of bt as a conventional insecticide and large-scale cultivation of bt-transgenic crops may lead to evolution of resistance in h. armigera populations to bt toxins. therefore, there is a need to develop strategies to manage development of resistance to bt toxins, taking into account the various resistance and/or detoxification mechanisms involved in the target and non-target insect pests in different eco-systems.

development of resistance to bt toxins has largely been attributed to the extent of binding of bt toxin proteins to brush border membrane vesicles. however, the toxicity of bt toxins to insects also depends on the enteric bacteria such as escherichia coli  and enterobacter sp. that normally reside in the insect mid gut  <cit> . there is considerable variation in the susceptibility of h. armigera larvae to bt toxins from different locations, and from different host plants  <cit> , which may be due to variation in gut microflora involved in insect nutrition, and potentiation/degradation of bt toxin proteins in the insect mid gut. therefore, diversity and population intensity of the enteric bacteria in the mid gut will have a bearing on the insect susceptibility to bt toxins deployed in transgenic crops for pest management.

interactions of gut microflora with infectious pathogens and toxins of pathogen or toxins of plant origin have been studied in many organisms, including crustacea, mollusca, echinodermata  <cit> , gypsy moth, butterflies  <cit> , and rats  <cit> . the crystal proteins of b. thuringiensis var alesti have shown little lethality to cabbage looper larvae, trichoplusia ni  reared on diets containing chlortetracycline at a concentration of 130 ppm  <cit> . addition of chlortetracycline hydrochloride in the artificial diet decreased the biological activity of hd- <dig> strain of b. thuringiensis by  <dig>  –  <dig>  times against 4-day-old larvae of t. ni, heliothis virescens , and ostrinia nubilalis   <cit> . presence of either bacterial spores or vegetative cells of e. coli several forest epiphytic bacteria significantly increased the biological activity of bt toxins cryiaa and cryiac against the gypsy moth, lymantria dispar   <cit> . bacillus thuringiensis resulted in  <dig> to100% mortality in vanesa cardui l., manduca sexta , pieris rapae , and h. virescens reared on diets without antibiotics, but only  <dig> to 10% mortality was recorded when the larvae were reared on diets amended with antibiotics  <cit> . antibiotics reduced the populations of gut bacteria below detectable limits, except in h. virescens, which had detectable bacteria prior to treatment with bt toxins. the reduction in insect mortality was associated with reduced populations of enterococcus and enterobactor species from the mid guts of the larvae  <cit> . re-establishment of enterobactor sp., which resides in the insect mid gut, restored the toxicity of bt toxins  <cit> . however, subsequent studies suggested that reduction in bt toxicity was not due to removal of gut bacteria, but due the effect of the antibiotics  <cit> . however, some of these studies used a different methodology, wherein, the antibiotics aureomycin and ampicillin were administered post bt treatment. the aseptic larvae that were exposed to the antibiotics during the bioassay or continuously exposed to the antibiotics died more slowly when treated with bt. however, the larvae administered with a cocktail of antibiotics conferred resistance to l. dispar against bt <cit> . bacillus cereus  strains secreting antibiotics synergised bt infection in the diamond back moth, plutella xylostella l., but at levels lower than reported earlier  <cit> . ingestion of antibiotic secreting strains reduced the abundance of gut microflora regardless of the genotype, reduced the densities of enteric isolates of the gut bacterium, enterobactor sp., suggesting that secretion of antibiotics in the mid gut synergises the bt infection by reducing the abundance of commensal gut microflora.

elimination of gut microbial community by oral administration of antibiotics significantly decreased the insecticidal activity of bt, and re-establishment of an enterobacter sp., that normally resides in the mid gut, restored the bt-mediated toxicity. however, b. thuringiensis is unable to grow in the insect hemocoel  <cit> , suggesting that other microbes residing the insect gut play an important role in biological activity of bt toxins against different insect pests. because of the profound effect of antibiotics through elimination of gut microbes on the toxicity of bt toxin proteins, it is important to study these interactions to understand the underlying mechanisms of potentiation and/or degradation of cry toxins by gut microflora to unravel the possible evolution of various mechanisms of resistance to bt used as pesticide sprays or deployed in transgenic crops for pest management.

RESULTS
effect of different concentrations of antibiotics on the mortality of h. armigera larvae due to bt toxins
bt formulation
the mortality of h. armigera larvae due to bt at lc <dig>   and lc <dig>   concentrations decreased with an increase in the dosage of antibiotics from  <dig>  to 500 μg ml− <dig> . the bt formulation at the ed <dig> levels did not cause any larval mortality. there were no significant differences in mortality of h. armigera larvae reared on diets with different amounts of the antibiotic mixture without bt, suggesting that antibiotics did not result in any adverse effects on the insect larvae. bt formulation at lc <dig> level resulted in  <dig> % larval mortality in insects reared on diets with  <dig> and 500 μg of each antibiotic ml− <dig> diet as compared to  <dig> % mortality in larvae reared on diets without antibiotics, suggesting that elimination of the gut microflora by antibiotics decreased the toxicity of bt towards the larvae of h. armigera.

cry1ab
the h. armigera larval mortality due to cry1ab toxin at the lc <dig>   and lc <dig>   concentrations decreased with an increase in the dosage of antibiotics from  <dig>  to 500 μg ml− <dig> . cry1ab at the ed <dig> level did not cause any larval mortality. there were no significant differences in the mortality of h. armigera larvae reared on diets with different amounts of the antibiotic mixture, but without cry1ab. highest mortality of  <dig> % was observed in h. armigera larvae reared on diets with lc <dig> level of the cry1ab toxin, but without antibiotics, whereas  <dig> % larval mortality was recorded when the insects were reared on diets with  <dig> and 500 μg of each antibiotic ml− <dig> diet with 35 μg ml− <dig> diet of cry 1ab toxin. the antibiotics decreased the activity of cry1ab by eliminating the gut microflora that possibly secreted enzymes involved in potentiation/detoxification of bt toxins.

cry1ac
the mortality of h. armigera larvae due to cry1ac toxin at lc <dig>   and lc <dig>   concentration decreased with an increase in the dosage of antibiotics from  <dig>  to 500 μg ml− <dig> diet of each antibiotic . larval mortality was  <dig>  to  <dig> % in insects reared on diets with 4 μg cry1ac ml− <dig> diet + antibiotics, but without cry1ac. highest larval mortality  was recorded in insects reared on diets with 35 μg cry1ac ml− <dig> diet without antibiotics as compared to 10% mortality in larvae reared on diets with  <dig> and 500 μg of each antibiotic ml− <dig> diet + 35 μg of cry <dig> ac ml− <dig> diet.

discussion
microorganisms play an important role in physiology and nutrition of insects  <cit> , and also provide protection against infectious pathogens and toxins of pathogen or plants in many organisms  <cit> . in the present studies, we studied the role of gut microbes in h. armigera on the biological activity of bt toxins by using antibiotics to eliminate the gut microflora. commercial bt formulation and the toxin proteins cry1ab and cry1ac induced larval mortality was reduced significantly when the larval diet was amended with antibiotics in a dose-dependent manner. mortality of insects fed with bt toxins was inversely proportional to the antibiotic concentration. decrease in microbial population with an increase in the dosage of the antibiotics resulted in a proportionate decrease in larval mortality. lowest larval mortalities were recorded in insects reared on diets with  <dig> and 250 μg of each antibiotic ml− <dig> diet along with lc <dig> concentrations of bt formulation and cry toxins, while maximum mortality was recorded in insects reared on diets without antibiotics + lc <dig> concentration of bt formulation/cry toxins. mortality of gypsy moth, l. dispar and cabbage looper, t. ni fed on bt amended diet has also been reported to be inversely proportional to the antibiotic concentration  <cit> . jarosz  <cit>  observed that streptococcus faecalis  in guts of g. mellonella larvae suppressed the bacteria ingested with food by producing bacteriocin - an antibiotic like substance having a narrow range of bactericidal activity, and by releasing a lysozyme like enzyme. the reduction in mortality due to bt was attributed to reduced populations of gut bacteria, enterococcus and enterobacter species. re-establishment of enterobacter sp. in larvae reared on antibiotic-amended diet restored the biological activity of bt <cit> .

the growth of bt drops to below detectable limits in the insect hemolymph after 6 h, whereas enterobacter sp. and e. coli grow rapidly in larval hemolymph, indicating that the enteric bacteria are needed for septicaemia associated with bt toxicity. bt does not grow in the insect hemocoel, indicating that bt alone is not responsible for septicaemia  <cit> . however, enteric bacteria alone do not induce mortality, suggesting that bt enables them to reach the hemocoel by making the gut epithelium permeable  <cit> . these findings are further supported by the earlier observations that the bt spores are absent from the insect hemocoel until very late in the infection process, and frequently do not appear until well after the death of the insect  <cit>  incorporation of pseudomonas and acinetobacter isolates in the mosquito blood meal result in an increased susceptibility of culex quiquefasciatus say to the japanese encephalitis virus  <cit> .

role of gut microflora in the susceptibility of h. armigera larvae to bt was also studied across three generations by rearing the insects on artificial diet amended with antibiotics with and without bt toxins. there was nearly 30% reduction in larval mortality from f <dig> to f <dig> generations when the larvae were reared on diets without antibiotics  and fed on  <dig> % bt formulation, 12 μg cry1ab ml− <dig> diet or 12 μg cry1ac ml− <dig> diet. however, when the insects were reared on diets with antibiotics , there was no significant reduction in insect mortality from f <dig> to f <dig> generations.

antibiotics have been reported to reduce the populations of gut microflora in many insect species and the reduction in insect mortality is associated with reduced populations of gut microflora, including enterococcus and enterobactor species from the mid guts of the larvae  <cit> . re-establishment of enterobactor sp., which resides in the insect mid gut microbial community, restored the toxicity of bt toxins  <cit> . bacillus cereus strains secreting antibiotics also synergise bt infection in the diamond back moth, p. xylostella <cit> . ingestion of antibiotic secreting strains reduced the abundance of gut microflora, and regardless of the genotype, reduced the densities of enteric isolates of the gut bacterium, enterobactor sp., suggesting that antibiotic secretion in the gut synergises the bt infection by reducing the abundance of commensal gut microflora. however, some workers have suggested that enteric bacteria did not contribute to insect mortality due to bt <cit> , and the reduction in bt toxicity was due the effect of the antibiotics on toxicity of bt toxins. however, they used a different methodology, wherein, the antibiotics aureomycin and ampicillin were administered post bt treatment. however, the larvae administered with a cocktail of antibiotics conferred resistance to l. dispar against bt <cit> . the aseptic larvae that were exposed continuously or only during the bioassay died slowly when treated with bt. the weights of h. armigera larvae increased with an increase in antibiotic concentration in the diet, indicating that elimination of gut microbes reduced the biological activity of bt, but not the larval growth, suggesting that these enteric bacteria do not cause any adverse effects on h. armigera larvae or play a major role in nutrition of h. armigera.

from the foregoing account, it is apparent that antibiotics reduce the activity of gut microflora in the insect mid gut, but the extent and the nature of effect on different species varies with the antibiotic used, administration of the antibiotics , dosage and the diversity of gut microflora in different insect species. the diversity of gut microflora varies across host plants on which the insect feeds and the geographical region from where the insects have been collected . the h. armigera populations collected from different host plants and from different regions also exhibit significant differences in their susceptibility to bt toxins. in the absence of gut microbes , the h. armigera larval mortality due to bt toxins was drastically reduced as compared to the larvae fed on diets without antibiotics . therefore, there is need to study the interaction of antibiotics with bt toxins, the effect of antibiotics on diversity of gut microflora in insects fed on different host plants and from different regions, identify the microbial species that influence the toxicity of bt toxins, the enzymes produced, and their role in potentiation of bt toxins  and degradation in the insect mid gut. this information will be important to develop strategies for resistance management in bt-transgenic crops for sustainable crop production and food security.

CONCLUSIONS
the toxicity of commercial bt formulation and the toxin proteins cry1ab and cry1ac to h. armigera larvae was reduced significantly when fed on diets amended with antibiotics. mortality of insects fed with bt toxins was inversely proportional to the antibiotic concentration. there was no selection for resistance to bt toxins in the absence of gut microflora, suggesting that enteric bacteria will play a major role in evolution of insect populations with resistance to bt toxins/bt-transgenic plants. it will be important to know which of these bacterial species are essential for insecticidal activity/detoxification of bt toxins.
