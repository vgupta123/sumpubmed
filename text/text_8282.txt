BACKGROUND
sucrose is an important product of photosynthesis, and is the main form of carbohydrate transported in the phloem in most higher plants  <cit> . sucrose transporters  are membrane proteins that facilitate the uptake of sucrose into the cytoplasm  <cit> . driven by the electrochemical h+ gradient across the membrane, sut proteins transport both sucrose and h+ into the cytoplasm at a ratio of 1: <dig>  <cit> . mutagenesis or antisense inhibition of sut genes causes severe defects in plant growth  <cit> . for example, t-dna insertions in the arabidopsis atsuc <dig> gene resulted in an excess of starch in source leaves, a lack of sucrose in sink tissues, and stunted plant growth  <cit> .

according to phylogenetic analysis, plant suts can be grouped into three types  <cit> . type i suts are only found in eudicots, and are necessary for phloem loading  <cit> . type ii transporters are present in all plants, and in monocots they are considered to function in phloem loading  <cit> . each plant species has at least one type iii sut, which is localized in the vacuolar membrane of cells  <cit> .

despite the importance of suts in plants, the substrate binding sites and transport mechanism remain largely unknown  <cit> . his <dig> in atsuc <dig> was identified as the site of substrate-protectable modification by the inhibitor depc  <cit> . although atsuc <dig> lost sucrose transport activity, h65k and h65r exhibited higher transport rates than the wild-type  <cit> , indicating his at this position is not essential for transport function. charged amino acids within transmembrane spans  were identified using a 3d structural model of type ii rice sucrose transporter ossut <dig> and five of them were identified as essential for sucrose transport activity  <cit> . among the five amino acids, conservative mutations of asp <dig>  arg <dig>  or asp <dig> resulted in complete loss of transport activity. in addition, alterations of arg <dig> or glu <dig> led to large decreases of the sucrose transport activity  <cit> .

prior to identification of the first sut cdna  <cit> , substrate analogs were used as inhibitors to investigate sucrose transporter-substrate interactions using leaf discs  <cit> , protoplasts from cotyledons  <cit> , or plasma membrane vesicles  <cit> . hydroxyls of the glucose ring are thought to be directly involved in substrate binding, while the fructosyl region provides a hydrophobic surface that is also important for binding  <cit> . replacement of the glucosyl 4-oh or 3-oh with hydrogen or fluorine showed the most dramatic decrease in substrate recognition  <cit> , indicating that the two hydroxyls interact with the sut protein via hydrogen bonding  <cit> . hydrogen substitution or fluorine substitution of the 2-oh  <cit>  or 6-oh  <cit>  also inhibited substrate transport.

plant sut proteins belong to the major facilitator superfamily , several members of which have been well studied  <cit> . mfs transporters share similar 3d structure  <cit> , and operate via a “rocker-switch” mode  <cit> . the most extensively investigated mfs protein is lactose permease of e. coli , which transports lactose and h+ into the cell at a ratio of 1: <dig>  <cit> . arg <dig> is one of the six irreplaceable amino acids of lacy; it is located in the middle of helix v, facing the central cavity  <cit> . a substitution of arg <dig> for lys results in complete loss of lactose transport activity  <cit> . arg <dig> of ossut <dig> has been suggested to function similarly; replacement of arg <dig> by lys results in complete loss of sucrose transport activity  <cit> . in lacy, arg <dig> forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond with 3-oh and 4-oh groups of the galactose moiety of lactose  <cit> . arg <dig> also interacts with glu <dig> when substrates are absent, and with glu <dig> during the substrate transport process  <cit> .

in this paper, the role of arg <dig> in the function of type ii sucrose transporter ossut <dig> was further explored. the effects of additional mutations on arg <dig> in ossut <dig> were tested. since arg <dig> is conserved in all suts, we tested the effect of mutations at this position in type i and type iii suts. the ability of ossut <dig> and ossut <dig> to rescue the dwarf phenotype of arabidopsis atsuc <dig> mutants was also tested. fluorine derivatives of α-phenyl glucoside were used to probe the roles of hydroxyl groups at the glucosyl  <dig> and  <dig> positions in substrate-protein interactions. based on results from these experiments we propose a putative binding interaction between arg <dig> of ossut <dig> and hydroxyl groups of sucrose. a role of arg <dig> in the substrate transport process is also suggested.

RESULTS
arg <dig> in ossut <dig> is required for transport activity
arg <dig> of ossut <dig> is 100% conserved in plant suts . the ossut <dig> mutant does not transport sucrose, yet the addition of sucrose induces a positive shift in current under voltage clamp conditions in oocytes expressing the mutant  <cit>  . β-phenyl glucoside is a substrate for type i and iii suts, but is not transported by type ii suts such as ossut <dig>  <cit> . the application of β-phenyl glucoside to oocytes expressing wild type ossut <dig> did not result in a change in current . however, application of β-phenyl glucoside to oocytes expressing ossut <dig> resulted in an upward shift in currents. this shift has been previously interpreted as a substrate-dependent block of inward coupling ion  leak  <cit> . in contrast, the monosaccharide glucose is not transported by suts, and showed no interaction with ossut <dig> mutant . 

to further evaluate the role of arg <dig> in ossut <dig>  substitutions were made with his and met . replacement of arg with his retains the positive charge, while met was selected since it has a long side chain similar in size to the side chain of arg. oocytes expressing r188h or r188m did not show detectable currents when sucrose was applied . the upward deflection in currents was only observed for ossut <dig> and not for ossut <dig> or ossut <dig> mutants . ossut <dig> localizes to the plasma membrane when expressed in oocytes  <cit> . the localization of r188h and r188m were not determined in oocytes, therefore the lack of transport activity could be due to transporter inactivity but we cannot rule out protein instability, degradation, or lack of targeting to the plasma membrane.

the substrate-induced upward deflection in currents were previously only measured  <cit>  in na ringer that contains a high concentration of na+ . therefore, experiments were performed to test whether the substrate-blocked leak current is carried by na+ rather than h+. oocytes expressing ossut <dig> were bathed in either na ringer or k ringer  at ph  <dig> . application of  <dig> mm induced an upward current deflection consistent with block of an inward leak through ossut <dig> that was indistinguishable in either na ringer or k ringer . the results are consistent with a h+ leak through ossut <dig>  another possibility is that upward deflections in currents were due to sucrose/h+ antiport activity. ossut <dig> was previously shown to not transport sucrose at ph  <dig>  when expressed in yeast  <cit> . we reasoned that if the r188k mutation caused a switch in ossut <dig> to antiporter activity, higher ph should stimulate 14c-sucrose uptake. wild-type ossut <dig> accumulated 14c-sucrose to a greater extent at ph  <dig>  versus ph  <dig>  . this is consistent with the acidic ph optimum for ossut <dig>  <cit>  and its function as a h+-coupled symporter. however, ossut <dig> mutant did not show 14c-sucrose uptake above vector control at ph  <dig>  or ph  <dig>  . this result favors the previous interpretation  <cit>  that substrate block of h+ leak is the likely explanation for the positive shift in currents on application of sucrose or β-phenyl glucoside to oocytes expressing ossut <dig> . 

ossut <dig> does not function in plants
loss of function mutations in the arabidopsis sucrose transporter atsuc <dig> result in dwarf plants due to defects in carbohydrate transport in the vascular tissue  <cit> . heterozygous suc2/suc <dig> plants do not have a visible phenotype and were transformed with either wild type ossut <dig> or ossut <dig>  the constructs also contained the atsuc <dig> native promoter and its 3’ utr. transformants with the suc2/suc <dig> background were identified by pcr. ossut <dig> reversed the growth defect of the suc2/suc <dig> plants, showing growth similar to wild-type suc2/suc <dig> plants . on the contrary, the ossut <dig> failed to rescue the suc2/suc <dig> mutant . the results indicate that arg <dig> is necessary for transport activity in plants. membrane localization of ossut <dig> in plants was not tested and therefore we cannot rule out the possibility that this mutant does not correctly localize to the plasma membrane.

arg corresponding to ossut <dig> r <dig> is important in type i and iii suts
if the conserved arg <dig> is important for the transport mechanism of suts, the corresponding arg to lys mutations should produce a similar defect in type i and iii suts. the equivalent arg in atsuc <dig>  a type i sut, and ljsut <dig>  a representative type iii sut were mutated . oocytes expressing wild-type atsuc <dig> displayed large inward currents when sucrose or β-phenyl glucoside were applied . the atsuc <dig> mutant completely lost transport activity as no inward current was observed on application of substrate . although wild-type atsuc <dig> produced larger currents  than ossut <dig>  when sucrose was applied, application of sucrose to oocytes expressing atsuc <dig> did not result in baseline shift of currents . the results demonstrated that this conserved arg was important for the substrate transport function of type i suts.

the type iii sut ljsut <dig> could transport sucrose and β-phenyl glucoside, but not glucose  <cit>  . compared with wild-type ljsut <dig>  oocytes expressing ljsut <dig> showed no sucrose-inducible inward currents, and no significant block of inward current by sucrose . as the sucrose-induced inward current of ljsut <dig>  was  <dig> times smaller than that of ossut <dig> , a block of an inward h+ leak in ljsut <dig> may have been too small to measure. however, the results supported the conclusion that the conserved arg was crucial for the substrate transport in type i, ii, and iii suts.

hydroxyls  <dig> and  <dig> in the glucose moiety of sucrose are crucial for substrate transport
in early investigations regarding the binding sites of suts, deoxyl analogs or deoxy-fluoro derivatives of substrates were used to inhibit the transport of 14c-sucrose  <cit> . it was not clear, however, whether the analogs could be transported by suts. two deoxy-fluoro derivatives of α-phenyl glucoside were used in oocyte electrophysiology experiments, because the size of fluorine is very similar to the size of a hydroxyl group and organic fluorine does not participate in hydrogen bonds as a donor or acceptor  <cit> . α-phenyl glucoside is transported by suts and it induces larger currents than sucrose in oocytes  <cit>  . a single substitution of either the 3-oh or 4-oh of α-phenyl-glucoside for a fluorine  caused large decreases of currents in ossut <dig> . this decrease of transport caused by deoxy-fluoro substitution supported the previous findings that 3-oh and 4-oh of substrates are important for substrate binding by suts. 

for oocytes expressing ossut <dig>  an upward deflection of current was observed in the presence of α-phenyl glucoside . this indicated that α-phenyl glucoside interacted with the mutant transporter and blocked the h+ leak . this interaction is likely to be an initial recognition step between potential substrates and sut proteins, because it occurred between β-phenyl glucoside and ossut <dig> . when phenyl-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-α-glucoside or phenyl-4-deoxy-4-fluoro-α-glucoside was applied to oocytes expressing ossut <dig>  a decrease of inward current was again observed . the two deoxy-fluoro analogs were transported at a lower rate than sucrose by wild-type ossut <dig> . however, they had equal or better h+ blocking effect compared to sucrose in ossut <dig> mutant . this indicated that the 3-oh and 4-oh were more important for the substrate transport step than for the initial substrate recognition step.

discussion
the conserved arg <dig> of ossut <dig> was previously suggested to be an essential amino acid for substrate transport by suts  <cit> . here we show that substitution of arg <dig> for lys, his, or met resulted in loss of substrate-inducible inward currents when expressed in oocytes . mutations of the corresponding arg in type i and type iii suts also showed a complete loss of substrate-inducible inward currents . when expressed in arabidopsis under atsuc <dig> native promoter, ossut <dig> reversed the dwarf phenotype of arabidopsis atsuc <dig> mutant but ossut <dig> did not. these results further support the suggestion that arg <dig> of ossut <dig> is essential for transport activity.

putative binding interactions between arg <dig> and sucrose
the sucrose-induced upward deflection in currents observed in oocytes expressing ossut <dig>  is interesting because it shows that the mutant retains the ability to bind sucrose. however, as shown by expression in yeast and 14c-sucrose uptake experiments, ossut <dig> does not transport sucrose across the membrane  <cit> . lack of 14c-sucrose uptake activity at ph  <dig>  or  <dig>  supports the idea that ossut <dig> has a h+ leak that is blocked by sucrose rather than sucrose/h+ antiport activity.

there is evidence that substrate binding involved in blocking the h+ leak is different than substrate binding required for glucoside translocation. first, the mutant ossut <dig> retains substrate binding but does not translocate substrates. second, β-phenyl glucoside blocks the h+ leak but is not translocated by wild-type ossut <dig>  third, β-paranitrophenyl glucoside inhibits sucrose transport activity of type ii sut from barley, hvsut <dig>  but is not a translocated substrate  <cit> . there is also evidence that a h+ leak in the absence of substrates occurs in wild-type sucrose transporters  <cit>  but at a lower rate. for example, sucralose acts as a competitive inhibitor of a type ii sut from sugarcane, shsut <dig>  but sucralose application alone does not cause an upward shift in currents in shsut1-expressing oocytes  <cit> . we hypothesize that substrate binding that blocks h+ leak is preliminary to substrate binding required for translocation.

electrophysiological assays using deoxyl-fluoro derivatives showed that the 3-oh and 4-oh of substrates were more important for the substrate transport process than the initial substrate recognition step . similarly, the interaction between potential substrates and ossut <dig> suggested that arg <dig> of ossut <dig> was more important for substrate transport than for initial substrate recognition. therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that arg <dig> of ossut <dig> interacts with 3-oh and 4-oh of the substrate during the transport process.

arg <dig> in ossut <dig> appears to have a similar function as arg <dig> in lacy. arg <dig> of lacy is the only positively charged key amino acid in the n-terminal half of the transporter  <cit>  and it is located in the middle of helix v, one of the helixes facing the central cavity  <cit> . the lacy mutant has no lactose transport activity  <cit> , demonstrating that both guanidine groups -nh <dig> are crucial. similarly, arg <dig> of ossut <dig> is the only positively charged key amino acid identified in the n-terminal half of the transporter  <cit> . in ossut <dig>  arg <dig> is predicted to be located in the middle of helix iv that surrounds the central transport pathway  <cit> . the ossut <dig> mutant does not transport sucrose  <cit>  , indicating that both -nh <dig> of this arginine are essential.

the interaction of ossut <dig> arg <dig> with its substrate is modeled after the well-studied interaction of arg  <dig> in lacy with lactose . a bidentate hydrogen bond between nh <dig> groups of arg <dig> in ossut <dig> and 3-oh and 4-oh groups of sucrose is proposed. for lacy, the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hydroxyl groups –oh in the galactose ring of lactose, especially 3-oh and 4-oh, are important for the substrate binding and transport  <cit> . similarly, the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hydroxyl groups in the glucose moiety of sucrose, particularly 3-oh and 4-oh, are essential for the substrate recognition and transport in suts  <cit> . further work will be required to determine whether one of the nh <dig> groups of arg <dig> interacts with another amino acid in the n-terminal half of protein, which triggers a major conformational change  analogous to the mechanism in lacy  <cit> . 

ossut <dig> in the sucrose transport process
all previously proposed transport mechanisms for suts are in agreement that on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, sucrose leaves the sut protein before release of the proton  <cit> . however, one model involves a sequential loading of the transporter on the extracellular side with proton binding followed by sucrose  <cit> . other results support a random binding model in which either sucrose or a proton can bind first on the extracellular side  <cit> . our results support an ordered binding of protons followed by sucrose . in this model, the transporter binds a proton on the extracellular side of the membrane and this facilitates sucrose binding . the fully loaded sut transporter has a conformational change, termed the “rocker-switch”  <cit> , to face the cytoplasmic side . sucrose and proton are then released . the empty carrier then flips back, returning its substrate binding sites to the apoplastic side . some protons bound at the apoplast of a sut could be released directly to cytoplasm , bypassing the sucrose-binding process. the un-coupled transport of h+ has been observed in wild-type stsut <dig>  but the rate was lower than the h+-coupled transport of sucrose  <cit> .

the ossut <dig> mutant has a larger uncoupled h+ leak, compared to wild-type ossut <dig>  that is blocked by substrate . however r188k does not transport sucrose. therefore, it is likely that r188k is blocked just prior to the “rocker switch” step in the transport cycle . substrate binding inhibits uncoupled transport , most likely by progressing the transporter to stage  <dig>  where the cycle is blocked. this explanation supports the concept that arg <dig> of ossut <dig> is essential for the transport of substrates across the membrane at the “rocker-switch” step .

CONCLUSIONS
r <dig> in ossut <dig> was identified as a charged amino acid within the fourth tms that is important for transport activity  <cit> . the r188k mutation in ossut <dig> results in a lack of sucrose transport but when assayed by voltage clamping in oocytes, an upward deflection in current occurs when sucrose is applied. the previous suggestion that this represents a substrate-induced block of h+ current  <cit>  appears to be correct. the inward leak though r188k is independent of na+  and r188k does not appear to function as an antiporter . we also show that while ossut <dig> is functional in the phloem when expressed in arabidopsis atsuc2- <dig>  the r188k mutant is not. this amino acid position is also conserved in type i and type iii suts  and corresponding mutations in arabidopsis atsuc <dig> and lotus japonicus ljsut <dig> resulted in a loss of transport activity . deoxy-fluoro derivatives of α-phenyl glucoside were used to investigate substrate binding by ossut <dig>  modification at the glucosyl 3-oh and 4-oh positions significantly reduced transport by wild type ossut <dig>  however, substrate-induced leak current block observed in the ossut <dig> mutant was not affected. based on these results, we propose 1) that in ossut <dig>  r <dig> is involved in substrate translocation and 2) an additional substrate binding site, independent of r <dig>  functions in initial substrate recognition and block of h+ leak through the r188k mutant.
