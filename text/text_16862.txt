BACKGROUND
small ruminant lentiviruses  cause arthritis, mastitis, interstitial pneumonia  and leukoencephalitis  in sheep and goats  <cit> . the clinical form visna in sheep was first described in iceland during the visna maedi virus  epidemic in the first half of the last century  <cit> . from then, this neurologic form has been reported only sporadically  <cit> . however, in the last few years, the neurological form of srlv disease has been diagnosed in numerous sheep of north-western spain, causing production losses  <cit> . in this outbreak, clinical signs usually appear at 1- <dig> years of age, but have been detected in animals as young as  <dig> months  <cit> . however, in other geographic areas of the world, visna appears in animals over  <dig> years of age  <cit> . also, in the animals affected by visna within the outbreak, lesions frequently involve the white matter of the spinal cord  <cit>  whereas in reported experimental visna cases, lesions usually appear mainly in the periventricular areas of the brain  <cit> .

central nervous system  infection may occur in the early phases of sheep srlv infection, as it occurs in human cns with human immunodeficiency virus infections . in hiv infections, viral quasispecies change in their adaptation to certain cell types, due to differences in selective pressure that may be exerted, for example, by the immune system  <cit> . consequently, the flow of genes among viral subpopulations is significantly restricted, leading to genetically distinct subpopulations and development of compartmentalization  <cit> . hence, the genetic heterogeneity between subpopulations of the individual could be explained by both an independent microevolution and the presence of related but phylogenetically distinct infecting virus genotypes  <cit> . viral populations distributed in compartments may have different phenotypic characteristics, such as cell tropism  <cit> , drug resistance  <cit>  and pathogenicity  <cit> . further studies on viral diversification, compartmentalization and adaptation of the virus to the brain are needed  <cit> . the cns provides a unique environment for the replication of lentiviruses. the blood-brain barrier presents specialized capillary endothelial cells, linked to each other by highly selective narrow bridges that may restrict viral traffic. during viral infection, a single strain appears to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier and establish the infection in the brain, which is otherwise isolated from the peripheral blood and the immune response  <cit> . viral genome structure may also contain key features determining the fate of infection.

in srlv infection, evidence of the relationship between srlv-derived clinical manifestation and strain genetic features has been described  <cit> , but there is no consensus on the specific viral genetic region that determines cell or tissue tropism  <cit> . tissue tropism may be dependent on the virus promoter sequence of both vmv and hiv  <cit> . however, sequence divergence found in viral promoter does not ensure changes in transcriptional activities and/or biological characteristics. ltr alone does not exert this function and other viral genes could be involved  <cit> .

different hiv and feline immunodeficiency virus  studies, based on a hypervariable region of the viral surface protein , have revealed tissue compartmentalization of the virus  <cit> . in hiv and fiv env, the v <dig> region is a determinant of cell tropism and replication efficiency, since it is thought to be related to the adsorption and fusion of the virus to the cell  <cit> . furthermore, in chronically infected individuals, particular amino acids of the v <dig> region modulate neurotropism and neurovirulence  <cit> . in srlv, five variable  and four conserved  regions have been identified in the su protein  <cit>  and the function of v <dig> hypervariable region has been found analogous to that of the v <dig> region of hiv  <cit> .

in this work involving env su regions , and the amino terminal sequence of the env tm protein, we first determined the existence of viral sequence diversity in the cns cells , broncho-alveolar lavage macrophages , lung tissue , mammary gland tissue , and peripheral blood mononuclear cells  and analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of srlv within animals belonging to an outbreak of clinical visna  <cit> . phylogeography approaches were also applied to identify the common ancestor sequences of the viral quasispecies. finally, the existence of compartmentalization and/or presumptive positive selection of viral genomes was assessed, with special emphasis on cns comparisons in order to better understand genetic diversity involved neurotropism and neurovirulence.

RESULTS
clinical signs and lesions
the animals included in this study presented symptoms compatible with the nervous form of vmv, such as hindleg ataxia or even paralysis, sternal or lateral recumbency and pedaling. histopathological examination indicated the presence of severe lesions in the cns in all the animals. in three of these animals the cns lesions were located only in the sc, which were characterized by non-suppurative perivascular cuffs and demyelination, when affecting the neuroparenchyma. seven of the animals showed also mild interstitial pneumonia, denoted by lymphoid infiltration in the lung alveolar walls. only two of the animals had lesions in the mg, characteristic of a mild non-purulent interstitial mastitis . no other pathogens were identified in the brain or other organs in the animals under study.

elisa and pcr
all the animals had anti-srlv antibodies as assessed by elitest  <cit> , with od ratios ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> . in spite of the availability of pbmc, bal, mg , l, cpx and sc samples from all the animals for pcr testing, only some samples allowed proviral amplification . pcr amplification detected proviral ltr dna mostly in tissues of the cns , whereas samples from l or mg yielded few positives and inconsistent results, respectively. ltr srlv sequences obtained in this study had a classical genotype a organization and characteristics.

the env pcr amplification was successful in all the animals, sc being always amplified . bal and cpx yielded pcr positive results in  <dig> of the  <dig> animals. the number of clones was also variable among samples and animals.

sequence and phylogeny studies
a representative sample of the env amplicons was sequenced and genotyped, revealing that, like in ltr, env srlv sequences obtained in this study had a classical genotype a characteristics, closer to vmv than to caprine arthritis encephalitis virus  prototypes . within each animal, the mean diversity of env sequences from cns ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % . the analysis of nucleotide diversity showed a quite uniform distribution of distances, except for the animal no.  <dig> having two distant sequence sub-sets  in different tissues, including cns. one of them grouped with those of the outbreak but not the other . diversity observed among sequences from the cns in different animals ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> %.

a inferences on tissue origin of most recent common ancestor were conducted only on large dataset 

b na: non applicable

c dn/ds value  was calculated excluding sequences with stop codons

phylogenetic analysis of srlv sequences within animals is shown in figure  <dig> and globally in additional file 1: 'phylogenetic tree including  <dig> partial env sequences from  <dig> animals'. with the exception of animal  <dig>  sequences belonging to the same animal clearly clustered together. in addition, within the animal, sequences showed a strong tissue compartmentalization, confirming the presence of different viral sub-populations in a single host. this was compatible with either a clonal evolution after initial infection with a single strain or a polyclonal origin of infecting viral strains. sequence distribution in tissues differed between animals. in addition, mg and l sequences frequently formed clearly defined clades, while pbmc sequences were the most variable and were usually located in different clades within an animal . individual phylogram study revealed the existence of sequences in cns, l, and/or mg that could derive from bal and/or pbmc. in animals  <dig> and  <dig>  sequences from cns  clustered close to each other. in both animals, these sequences, when present, were also close to bal, like sc sequences from animal  <dig>  in fact, in sheep  <dig>  both cns and bal sequences belonging to the late clade appeared to descend from bal, l and/or pbmc . in sheep  <dig>  there were differences in sequence distribution between the two sequence sub-sets. in one of them bal and pbmc sequences were close to those from cns  and mg; and the other revealed the proximity of pbmc sequences to cns , mg and l. in animal  <dig> cpx sequences belonged to a cluster different from that of sc sequences of the cns, confirming the existence of different viral sequence clusters within the cns, and pbmc sequences were close to the tree root. also, sequences from a particular tissue appeared to have evolved within the tissue; this was the case of mg sequences in animals  <dig> and  <dig> or, less markedly sc sequences in animal  <dig>  among others. thus, once in the target organ, the virus seemed to have evolved, allowing the appearance of new clones within the same tissue.

the common ancestor state was then reconstructed, using bayesian methods recently developed in phylogeography  <cit>  . evolutionary parameters were estimated under the bayesian skyline plot uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model. the convergence of chains was reached  and maximum clade credibility trees were obtained for each animal. the results showed that viral evolution within animals followed the usual infection paths. specifically, in animals  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  where sequences from bal were present, bronchoalveolar macrophages were identified as the most likely tissue infected by the viral common ancestor. in animals  <dig> and  <dig>  in which bal samples were unavailable, pbmc had the highest probability to be the tissue infected by the viral ancestor. these data strongly suggest that the infection starts from the lungs and later reaches other tissues through the blood. an interesting aspect of these results is that cns, lung and mammary gland are terminal clades in this evolutionary model, associated to bal and pbmc taxa .

in this evolutionary context, the average number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site  and the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site  were determined for proviral sequences obtained from each animal. the dn rates were lower than the ds rates in all the animals, indicating the presence of within-host purifying selection , but in favour of synonimous substitutions leading to nucleotide heterogeneity and compartmentalization .

compartmentalization regarding "segregation" of sequences between different animals and between tissues of a particular animal was assessed  according to parsimony score , association index  and monophyletic clade  values. results on ps and ai showed weak phylogeny-trait association and significant monophyletic clade  value, altogether indicative of tissue compartmentalization in six of the studied animals. in particular, cns sequences belonged to a different cluster compared to other tissues, within the animal. this was observed in the six animals that had at least two tissues  from which the number of sequences obtained was sufficient  to carry out the study, demonstrating and confirming the existence of cns tissue compartmentalization. lack of significance in ps, ai and mc analyses was observed only rarely, when a low number of sequences was available .

* the animal  <dig> was not included because less than  <dig> sequences were available

overall, these results indicate strong sequence segregation between animals and the existence of tissue compartmentalization within the animal.

a signature pattern analysis was performed in search of conserved amino acid motifs specific to a particular tissue, but we were unable to find this pattern in the genetic region under analysis. also analysis of the potential asn-x-ser/thr glycosylation site was carried out  <cit> . this site was present in sequences from all the animals  and was equally distributed in different tissues, discarding glycosylation pattern as a possible explanation for compartmentalization.

discussion
this study provides evidence of vmv compartmentalization within the cns and other tissues and confirms its existence in the mammary gland as previously described between blood and colostrum  <cit>  amongst seropositive naturally infected small ruminants. the sheep had visna-like severe lesions in the cns, with non-suppurative meningo-encephalitis  <cit> . according to the specific feature of this outbreak  <cit> , most animals presented lesions in the spinal cord and  <dig> percent in the brain. most of them also presented lung lesions. vmv sequence distribution differed between animals, as revealed by phylogenetic analysis. the different compartmentalization patterns may be explained by differences in host genetic susceptibility, anatomical features, the genome of the infecting viruses, as well as high rates of mutation and replication, generating a quasispecies  <cit> , and variants which may escape from surveillance  <cit> . compartmentalization may involve genetic drift and founder effects  <cit> , and/or being a consequence of different selective pressures  <cit> .

respiratory secretions containing infected alveolar macrophages can be responsible for srlv transmission, especially in intensive rearing systems such as those applied in the assaf breed of the animals under study  <cit> . consequently, blood, lymph, and then target tissues, such as l, mg, cpx and sc of cns, become infected  <cit> . following purifying selection  the virus evolves and compartmentalizes, producing a quasispecies. thereafter, the virus may go back through lymphoid and blood cells to other tissues. in line with this scheme and using a novel methodology previously applied to investigate geographical origin of sequences  <cit> , we found as expected, that intra-host ancestor sequences were not located in the cns or other tissues, but in bal or pbmc . pbmc sequences were present in different clades, displaying the broadest variation per tissue, which is compatible with migration of virus from blood to tissues and vice versa.

however, particular ancestor/primary sequences could not be always identified. this may be due to the unavailability of pcr amplification in some samples. thus, clones analyzed in the ancestor tissues  may have not included the complete spectrum of ancestor viral sequences. besides, all samples were obtained at a single time point  even though the time points of infection by a particular virus may have not been simultaneous at different body sites. also, there may have been re-infection events from inside or outside the body . finally, body sites other than bal  may have been the initial source of infection.

the virus under study belonged to the genotype a, also involved in other visna infections  <cit> . like in cns studies of hiv  <cit>  and in contrast with findings on fiv  <cit>  infections, we were unable to find any cns-specific signature pattern. in these lentiviruses, v3-v <dig> regions of su encoding neutralizing epitopes may mutate, leading to viral resistance to existing antibodies also affecting cell tropism  <cit> , including neurotropism and neurovirulence  <cit> . amongst the srlv sequences under study , v <dig> - claimed to have a function analogous to that of hiv-v <dig> region  <cit>  - was the most variable. although variable and constant regions within the srlv su protein may trigger the production of neutralizing antibodies  <cit> , the main sites/epitopes involved in this process have not been identified. additional factors or genetic regions, such as those encoding viral proteins  that interact with host molecules , might be involved in neuroinvasion.

of the  <dig> mg clones of animal  <dig>   <dig> showed a non-synonymous transition c to t at the same position, inserting a stop codon along the env region encoding the su protein . the finding of stop codons along with codifying sequences suggests the emergence of quasispecies, the presence of a high rate of viral evolution and thus the existence of defective interfering particles/heteroclites. however, numerically realistic model studies suggest that these particles are unlikely to survive or influence viral dynamics  <cit> .

work on hiv and simian immunodeficiency virus  has shown that viral evolution in the brain is peculiar in that this immunologically privileged site allows a low level of viral replication  <cit>  before disease onset  <cit> , but it may be considered a "sanctuary" where the virus can evolve freely, avoiding the effects of adaptive immunity and/or therapy  <cit> . in line with this, the least conserved env amino acid sequence was found in sc and the most conserved in l . the diagnostic ltr-pcr used in this study only yielded consistent amplifications when using cns as dna source, since all animals were seropositive and yielded pcr-specific amplicons in cns . this strongly suggests that cns is a preferred site of infection in the visna affected animals involved. srlv replication occurred in brain, since viral antigens p <dig> and gp <dig> were detected in cns by immunohistochemistry and two fully replicative viral isolates, able to replicate in scp cells, were obtained from sc and cerebrospinal fluid from two of the diseased sheep used   <cit> . this is compatible with studies on hiv infections, where viral replication in the cns occurs in diseased individuals, leading then to divergent trends in different compartments  <cit> .

this study shows that different srlvs can coexist in the cns from a visna diseased sheep. this was clearly observed in animal  <dig>  infected by two viruses , one closer to the remaining outbreak sequences than the other. under the hypothesis that the strain's genetic makeup  and induced pathology are associated, the set of sequences most similar to other sequences in the outbreak would be causing the nervous clinical signs. the cns 333a sub-set sequences were essentially from cpx  and to a lower extent from sc , whereas 333b ones were similarly represented in cpx  and sc . this would be consistent with a recent infection in the case of 333a, in which the virus from infected cpx cells  reached only a few sc sites. in the case of 333b sequences, the infection appeared to have been longer established, as it extended to various sc sites after cpx initial infection. whether different viruses infected different cells of the same tissue  or different viruses coinfected the same cell type remains unknown. in any case, this study demonstrates in vmv infections that, like in those by siv, the physical continuity of the brain tissue does not necessarily result in phylogenetic proximity  <cit> . disruption of the blood-brain or the blood-csf  barriers may have taken place, as proposed in fiv and hiv infections  <cit> . in hiv infections, cpx may allow a bidirectional productive lentiviral infection of cns and peripheral organs, having often a mixture of viral sequences  <cit> . similarly in this study, vmv-infected cells may have crossed the cpx barrier to colonize csf and sc, and gone back from there to blood through blood-brain or blood-csf  barriers.

CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained in this work provide evidence of type a srlv compartmentalization in the cns and other tissues. these viruses can be found in tissues that allow horizontal transmission among the animals of the outbreak. ancestor tissue estimation strongly suggests that infection appears to start in alveolar macrophages  or blood  when bal was unavailable. likely, pbmc became infected after intake of virus or infected cells/particles through respiratory and/or mammary secretions, including colostrum/milk. moreover, the identification of sequences from mammary gland  as terminal tips in the trees supports this hypothesis, indicating the two main compartments from which the virus can be transmitted.

through this route, circulating a viruses cause neuropathological disease in the assaf animals under study. subsequently and according to phylogeny observations, viruses may either reach different tissues including the cns, lung, and mammary gland and compartmentalize or be transmitted from ancestor tissues  to new hosts.
