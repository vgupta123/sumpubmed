BACKGROUND
rem sleep  is characterised by rapid eye movements, a mixed frequency, low amplitude eeg, and a low submental muscle tone with phasic twitches. at the transition from non-rem sleep  to rems these three features do not appear synchronously. the emg level may decrease prior to the occurrence of the two other markers, and may also persist for some time after the end of rems  <cit> . nrems with low muscle tone  was observed not only before and after rems but also at sleep onset in a selective rems deprivation study. nlmt was enhanced by total sleep deprivation and selective rems deprivation  <cit> . it was proposed that epochs of nlmt could be correlates of rems and therefore serve as markers of rems regulation.

the aim of the present study was to further investigate the relationship between nlmt and rems by analysing the first  <dig> h of a 4-h nocturnal sleep episode and a subsequent 3-h daytime sleep episode.

RESULTS
rems latency and sorems episodes
rems latency showed a unimodal distribution with a maximum at  <dig> min during night sleep and a bimodal distribution with modes at  <dig> and  <dig> min and a trough at  <dig> min during morning sleep . one single sleep onset rems  episode occurred at night, while a total of  <dig> sorems episodes were observed during morning sleep . at night, rems latencies ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes. the four longest latencies were from a single individual with a 'skipped' first rems episode in all four nights . in the morning, rems latencies ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes. the duration of nrems episodes following a sorems episode ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> min ; this range is comparable to that of rems latencies at night .

seven of  <dig> subjects showed sorems episodes in all four morning sleep episodes, one subject in three, three in two and three in one episode. only two subjects had no sorems episode.

episodes of nlmt
epochs of nrems with low muscle tone  are illustrated for one subject . the latency to the first appearance of nlmt showed a bimodal distribution with modes at  <dig> and  <dig> min in night sleep . the first mode was centred at sleep onset and the second mode was situated in the proximity of rems onset. the distribution closely resembled the distribution of rems latencies in morning sleep. a unimodal distribution with a mode at  <dig> min was observed in morning sleep . epochs of nlmt were more frequent in morning sleep than in the first  <dig> hours of night sleep .

in night sleep,  <dig> episodes of nlmt at sleep onset were observed . the one subject with four 'skipped' first rems episodes at night showed neither sorems episodes nor episodes of nlmt at sleep onset. the other subject without sorems episodes had no episode of nlmt at sleep onset at night but three in the morning.

in  <dig> of the  <dig> morning sleep episodes without sorems, episodes of nlmt at sleep onset were observed. their length was similar in night and morning sleep.

slow wave activity
the mean time course of swa during night and morning sleep is plotted in fig.  <dig>  mean swa in the first nrems episode of morning sleep was lower than in the first nrems episode of night sleep . slow-wave energy  of the first nrems episode was also lower in the morning than at night.

simulations of process s were performed  to test whether the changes in swa were in accordance with the two-process model of sleep regulation  <cit> . process s represents the homeostatic  process of sleep regulation. its time course was derived from eeg swa  <cit> . the simulations were based on a regular sleep-wake schedule  followed by a  <dig> h sleep episode at night  and a  <dig> h daytime sleep episode . the time constants  corresponded to those used in daan et al.  <cit> . the simulations revealed a reduced level of s  at sleep onset in the morning  compared with the level at sleep onset at night . for night sleep, a close correspondence between empirical swa and the simulated level of s was observed . in the first nrems episode of morning sleep, however, the predicted level of s was above the empirical values .

sleep variables derived from visual scoring 
waking after sleep onset, the duration and percentage  of rems and stage  <dig> were higher in the morning than at night, whereas the amount of stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was lower. sleep latency was shorter in the morning than at night, whereas rems latency did not differ if sorems was excluded. total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and movement time did not differ between night and morning sleep episodes.

cycle and episode duration 
sleep cycle duration did not differ between night and morning sleep. rems episodes, however, were longer and nrems episodes shorter in morning sleep than in night sleep.

discussion
episodes of nlmt
the present study aimed at clarifying the relationship between a particular feature of nrems, nlmt, and rems regulation by analysing restricted nocturnal sleep and subsequent daytime sleep. the results provide evidence that nlmt is determined by rems propensity.

nlmt occurred more frequently in morning sleep than in night sleep. in morning sleep, the latency to the first epoch of nlmt showed a unimodal distribution. in night sleep, a bimodal pattern prevailed with modes at sleep onset and in the proximity of rems onset . this distribution corresponds to that of rems latency in morning sleep . it is also similar to the pattern that had been observed in a selective rems deprivation protocol  <cit> . the duration of the episodes of nlmt at sleep onset was slightly longer than the duration of sorems episodes and their latency was shorter. low muscle tone usually precedes and outlasts rems  <cit> . from these results, we conclude that nlmt may represent a window for sorems. if the episodes of nlmt at sleep onset would just represent the normal wake-sleep transition then muscle tone would be expected to gradually decrease  <cit> . as illustrated in figure  <dig>  both decrease and increase of muscle activity at sleep onset were typically rather sudden. no specific eeg markers were found to accompany episodes of nlmt as revealed by gross visual inspection.

when nrems and rems were considered together, 86% of the morning sleep episodes, but only 37% of the night sleep episodes started with low muscle tone. in morning sleep both the circadian drive  <cit>  and the reduced nrems pressure contributed to a high rems propensity. low muscle tone may be considered a rems marker irrespective of the manifestation of this sleep state and epochs of low muscle tone at sleep onset may reflect the early appearance of rems. if the drive for rems is low, nlmt may be the only manifestation of this sleep state. nlmt may therefore be regarded as a facet of rems regulation as previously proposed  <cit> . in that study, selective rems deprivation increased nlmt in recovery sleep and nlmt was higher in daytime sleep than in the baseline night  <cit> . in our study, the number of episodes of nlmt increased, in parallel to sorems and rems, in morning sleep compared to night sleep. the present findings challenge the concept of discrete states and favours the concept of interleaved states  <cit> . our hypothesis could, for instance, further be tested in a forced desynchrony protocol that allows to separate homeostatic and circadian components  <cit> .

low muscle tone is required to score rems  <cit> . when speaking of muscle tone or emg, sleep researchers usually refer to recordings of submental or mental muscle activity, which has a state-specific tone  <cit> . one has to keep in mind that the muscle tone of trunk and limb muscles shows a different pattern than the muscle tone of head and neck muscles: the reduced tonic level during sleep remains rather stable throughout the night without further decrease in rems  <cit> . cells in the medial brainstem reticular formation are thought to control motor movement  <cit> . they are active during waking and rems while during nrems their activity is reduced  <cit> . during rems motoneurons in the brainstem are tonically inhibited although central motor systems are highly active  <cit> . motoneuron hyperpolarisation and ensuing loss of muscle tone are due to a combination of disfacilitation and inhibition by the co-ordinated action of gaba and glycine release onto the motoneurons and concomitant decrease of norepinephrine and serotonin release onto them  <cit> . if our assumption is correct, then the activity of the motoneurons during episodes of nlmt should show a similar pattern as seen during rems.

sorems
the high number of sorems episodes in morning sleep  showed that this phenomenon is common in experimental protocols and illustrates that there may indeed be a rems window at sleep onset. sorems episodes and increased amounts of rems were reported for subjects sleeping in the morning after a night with or without sleep  <cit> . in a time-free environment  <cit>  and in a forced desynchrony protocol  <cit> , sorems occurred at a circadian phase corresponding to morning sleep. their number decreased in naps scheduled throughout daytime hours   <cit> . after spontaneous wakefulness in a long scotoperiod protocol, sorems episodes were more frequent in the early morning hours  <cit> . not only circadian factors but also nrems pressure influences sorems propensity. thus sleep initiated at 7: <dig> h after total sleep deprivation did not result in increased rems  <cit> . in the present study, sorems and rems were enhanced in morning sleep by the high circadian drive and the reduced nrems propensity. the preceding restricted nocturnal sleep episode not only reduced nrems propensity  but also induced a partial rems deprivation, as a large portion of rems occurs in the second half of the night. the shorter sleep latency in the morning than at night may be due to the increased rems propensity.

slow wave activity
simulations with the two-process model of sleep regulation  <cit>  revealed a close correspondence between empirical swa and the level of s for night sleep. however, the empirical values of swa were below the predicted level of s in the first nrems episode of morning sleep. this discrepancy between the data and the model is in accordance with findings of beersma and co-workers  <cit>  who reported reduced intensity of nrems under conditions of increased rems pressure. as already discussed, the 4-h sleep episode in the previous night decreased nrems pressure, which did not increase again up to the level of night sleep because the time between the night and the morning sleep episode was too short. concomitantly, the sleep restriction and the circadian phase increased rems pressure. thus, increased rems propensity appears to inhibit the full manifestation of swa in morning sleep. therefore not only a high nrems pressure impedes rems, but also high rems drive lowers nrems intensity  <cit> . thus, swa represented in the model by process s is not just dependent on sleep-wake history, but additionally on the balance between nrems and rems pressure.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that nlmt is a marker of homeostatic and circadian rems regulation. at sleep onset, the epochs of low muscle tone represent an early manifestation of rems. reduced nrems pressure associated with enhanced homeostatic and circadian rems drive in the morning can account for the higher frequency of sorems episodes and epochs of nlmt in morning sleep than in night sleep.
