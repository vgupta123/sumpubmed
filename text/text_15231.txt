BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the major pathogens infecting humans worldwide. it is the most common cause of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and childhood ear infections, but can also give rise to severe cases of meningitis and sepsis. it is estimated that 1– <dig> million people die from pneumococcal diseases every year  <cit> .

the main pneumococcal virulence factor is the antiphagocytic capsular polysaccharide, depending on which pneumococci can be divided into at least  <dig> serotypes  <cit> . other virulence factors described include cell wall components such as peptidoglycan, teichoic acid, lipoteichoic acid as well as cell surface proteins such as the choline-binding proteins  <cit>  and the recently described pneumococcal pilus  <cit> . signature-tagged mutagenesis  has revealed a surprisingly large number of additional loci required for pneumococcal virulence in mice. even though mutants in genes identified by stm are able to grow in vitro, it is not known to what extent these mutations cause fitness defects that might have an effect on virulence  <cit> .

despite causing severe diseases, pneumococci are also frequent colonizers of healthy individuals. 60–70% of children attending day-care centers may harbor these bacteria in their nasopharynx  <cit> . it is not fully understood which bacterial and host factors that contribute to the transition from carriage to disease. invasive disease potential has been shown to differ between serotypes  <cit> , but other genetic factors are also important for disease outcome in humans  <cit> . previously we have shown in animal models that not only serotype, but also clonal type , affects clinical outcome  <cit> .

whether or not variation in growth rate among pneumococcal isolates affects virulence has not been investigated. here we monitored the in vitro growth rate for a series of clinical pneumococcal isolates with different ability to grow in blood after intraperitoneal challenge of mice  <cit> . these isolates belong to different serotypes and different clonal types as determined by mlst. to further evaluate the impact of in vitro fitness on virulence, we generated mutants defective in non-essential genes belonging to the pneumococcal core genome and known to be universally present in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria  <cit>  and therefore unlikely to represent bona fide virulence genes. we find that bacterial fitness defects, as monitored by bacterial growth rates in vitro, proportionally decreases pneumococcal virulence in animal models, without abolishing the ability to colonize the upper airways.

RESULTS
in vitro growth rates of pneumococcal isolates and the relationship to colonization and virulence in mice
previously, we studied a collection of clinical pneumococcal isolates of serotypes  <dig>   <dig>  6b, 7f,  <dig> and 19f belonging to different clonal types  <cit> . after intranasal challenge only tigr <dig> and isolates of type 6b caused invasive disease. however, after intraperitoneal challenge both the median survival time and end-point survival rate differed between the isolates. tigr <dig> and the two isolates of types 6b, 7f and 19f respectively were highly virulent after intraperitoneal infection, while isolates 1-b, 14-a, 1-a and 14-b were less virulent in decreasing order   <cit> . more than 90% of the mice survived > <dig> hours when inoculated with 14-b as compared to 50% with a challenge of 14-a.

to investigate whether the differences observed in survival in vivo could be correlated to differences in fitness, growth rate estimations and growth curves were made using a bioscreen equipment . all except one isolate showed generation times, in semisynthetic c+y medium, between  <dig> and  <dig> minutes. these differences in growth rates did not fully correspond to the abilities of the same isolates to grow in blood in vivo and to cause systemic disease  <cit> . thus, isolate 1-b was more virulent than 1-a despite that the former isolate showed a slower in vitro growth rate. nevertheless, it is interesting to note that the two 6b isolates showing the highest growth rates in vitro were the most virulent ones after intraperitoneal infection in mice. only the type14-b carrier isolate exhibited a significantly longer generation time  compared to all other isolates, which was in line with its low virulence potential in mice.

comparative genomic hybridizations were next carried out on the isolates14-a and 14-b to identify gene content differences that could explain the fitness defect of the latter isolate. microarrays were used, representing the full genomes of strains r <dig>  <cit>  and tigr <dig>  <cit> . the invasive serotype  <dig> isolate of st <dig>  and the carrier isolate of st <dig>  differed from one another at approximately  <dig> genes including some variable regions. r6-specific cluster  <dig>  <cit> , c11*  <cit> , c13*  <cit>  and most of tigr4-specific cluster  <dig>  <cit> , also known as ppi- <dig>  were present in 14-a but absent in 14-b. tigr4-specific cluster  <dig> and  <dig> as well as c4*, c5* and part of r6-specific cluster  <dig>  <cit>  were absent in 14-a, but present in 14-b. in addition, the two isolates differed from each other at  <dig> loci found to affect virulence by signature-tagged mutagenesis screen . six of these loci were absent in 14-b, seven were absent in 14-a and five had differences in sequence between the two isolates. one of the genes that varied in sequence was sp <dig>  which is included in the same operon as hemk . also, sp <dig> of the hemk operon was missing in the slow-growing 14-b isolate, where sp <dig> was directly followed by sp <dig>  sp <dig> has previously been reported to be missing from some sequenced clinical isolates   <cit> .

note: genes that are present are designated +, genes that are absent are designated -. in cases where sequence differences were found between the test isolates, subscripts indicate which reference strain the test strain hybridized to.

even though we found large differences in the content of virulence and putative metabolic genes between the two type  <dig> isolates, we could not pinpoint one specific gene responsible for the observed defect in growth and virulence. therefore we next studied isogenic mutants in conserved housekeeping genes in the pneumococcal genome.

in vivo studies of isogenic mutants with different generation times
to investigate the association between in vitro growth rate and in vivo ability to colonize and cause systemic disease insertion-deletion mutants were created in five genes in tigr <dig>  one of the most virulent strains in c57bl/ <dig> mice in our collection. microarray analysis of  <dig> pneumococcal isolates belonging to different serotypes and clones revealed that all carried the five genes, indicating that they belong to the pneumococcal core genome . these highly conserved genes are present in all pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic bacterial species investigated so far  <cit> , hence it is unlikely that they represent bona fide virulence genes. they were chosen since they appear to be house-keeping genes and gene inactivation would likely lead to fitness defects. they all have homologues in e. coli, hence we used their e. coli designations and named the mutants tigr4Δychf , tigr4Δrlud , tigr4Δsmf , tigr4Δhemk  and tigr4Δyebc . when in vitro growth rates were measured in c+y semisynthetic medium, the rlud and smf mutants showed almost wild-type fitness with generation times of  <dig> and  <dig> minutes respectively, as compared to  <dig> minutes for the wild-type tigr <dig> strain  . however, the insertion-deletion mutants of ychf, hemk and yebc all had reduced growth rates,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes respectively . the growth defect was especially pronounced for the hemk mutant, showing smaller colonies on blood agar plates. the growth differences for the mutant collection were also recorded in th medium . also in this medium the hemk mutant showed the most pronounced growth rate defect and reached a lower density at stationary phase.

to mimic the natural route of infection, c57/bl <dig> mice were challenged intranasally with the five insertion-deletion mutants respectively. all mutants gave rise to the same type of disease, but with different frequencies. for those mice where bacteria could be cultured from blood, health status rapidly and irreversibly deteriorated. at the time of sacrifice all mice with invasive pneumococcal infection had similar amounts of bacteria in the blood and lungs , irrespective of challenge strain. thus, once bacteremia occurred, even the severely growth defective hemk mutant was not cleared from the blood stream. three of the five mutants, tigr4Δychf, tigr4Δhemk and tigr4Δyebc, gave a higher end-point survival than the wild-type tigr <dig> strain with 55% , 77%  and 56%  survival respectively by  <dig> hours, compared to 31% for tigr <dig> . in contrast, tigr4Δrlud, and tigr4Δsmf, were not attenuated, with survival rates of 38%  and 32%  respectively. there was a good relationship between end-point survival and in vitro growth rate . the growth-defective mutants were capable of colonizing the mice to a similar extent  <dig> days post infection as tigr <dig> .

out of the five mutants, the growth defect was most pronounced for the hemk mutant. since insertion-deletion mutagenesis is likely to give polar effects on downstream genes in the same operon, in-frame mutants were constructed in hemk and in the two genes directly downstream of hemk  in order to pinpoint the responsible gene for the growth defect . nucleotides were altered in the 5'-end of the open reading frames, introducing stop codons. the slow-growing insertion-deletion mutant of hemk gave smaller colonies than tigr <dig> on blood agar plates. of the in-frame mutants only the mutant in sp <dig>  gave the same phenotype with small colonies, while the in-frame mutants of hemk  and sp <dig>  both showed wild-type colony size. the reduced colony size for tigr4ssp1022- corresponded to a reduced number of bacteria/colony  after  <dig> hours of incubation on blood agar plates. growth rate estimations with bioscreen verified that only tigr4syrdc- gave a longer generation time in c+y medium than tigr4s,  <dig> minutes as compared to  <dig> minutes  . the generation times for tigr4shemk- and tigr4ssp1023- were  <dig> minutes  and  <dig> minutes  respectively. the same relative differences in in vitro growth rate for the different in frame mutants was also found after growth in th-medium, with tigr4shemk- and tigr4ssp1023-exhibiting similar growth rate as tigr4s and tigr4syrdc- exhibiting a severe growth defect .

next, mice were challenged intranasally with tigr4s, tigr4shemk- or tigr4syrdc- . the survival rates with tigr4shemk- and tigr4s were 40% , with median survival time of  <dig> h and  <dig> h respectively. all mice survived after challenge with tigr4syrdc- . however,  <dig> out of  <dig> mice infected with this mutant remained colonized, as determined by cfu count from nasopharynealtracheal lavage at day  <dig> post-infection , albeit at a lower level than those challenged with tigr4s ).

discussion
the pneumococcal genome consists of a core genome representing about 70% of the total gene content. the remaining 30% represents variable genes that may be present or absent in different isolates . several of these variable genes are predicted to have metabolic functions, and therefore do not represent true virulence genes, even though in vivo screens using signature-tagged mutagenesis have identified a number of them as necessary to cause invasive disease in murine models  <cit> . since in vitro fitness might be one explanation for differences found in vivo we aimed to determine whether in vitro fitness, as determined by in vitro growth rates, correlates to virulence in vivo. we used two clinical isolates each of serotypes  <dig>  6b, 7f,  <dig> and 19f with known virulence in an intraperitoneal mouse model  <cit>  and compared growth rates with a bioscreen apparatus. the two isolates of each serotype were chosen to be in most cases one carriage isolate and one invasive isolate that were genetically unrelated based on mlst profiles . differences in virulence had previously been detected between the two type  <dig> isolates, and an even more pronounced difference was found between the two type  <dig> isolates  <cit> . major differences in in vitro growth rates between strains of the same serotype were detected only for type  <dig> isolates, suggesting in vitro growth to be an important parameter for the outcome in vivo. the two type  <dig> isolates were genetically unrelated by mlst  and microarray analysis, differing from each other at  <dig> loci found to effect virulence by stm screens . seven of these loci were absent in the more virulent 14-a isolate, while six were absent in 14-b. in five of the loci there were differences in sequence between the two isolates, with 14-a carrying genes equal to tigr <dig>  and 14-b having the r <dig> equivalents. of the genes missing in slow-growing 14-b, at least two are predicted to be involved in transport functions , but it is not known if defects in these genes affect growth.

for the two isolates of type  <dig>  the differences in virulence could not be explained by differences in growth rates. several features, besides growth fitness in a rich complex medium such as c+y, may influence the disease potential of a pneumococcal strain including the capsular type being expressed. this is also reflected by the fact that the differences seen in in vitro growth rate between the clinical isolates of different serotypes did not fully correspond to differences in mice virulence as monitored after intraperitoneal challenge. ability to retrieve carbohydrates from complex glycoconjugates is likely important for pneumococcal ability to grow in different host environments  <cit> . virulence-associated differences among clinical isolates in carbohydrate retrieval may only be revealed during in vitro growth using carbon sources mimicking the host environment, and was not further investigated in this paper. instead we attempted to correlate the relationship between in vitro growth rate and in vivo virulence in mice creating a panel of mutants in the tigr <dig> background deficient in highly conserved non-essential house keeping genes that were unlikely to affect carbohydrate metabolism of streptococcus pneumoniae. tigr <dig> was used since it is fully sequenced and since it is the most virulent strain in our collection after intranasal challenge.

the five candidate genes in the pneumococcal core genome were chosen based on a previous publication by garbom et al.  <cit> . garbom et al. showed that these genes are needed for full virulence of yersinia in vivo, but they have only been considered as housekeeping genes in pneumococci. their functions have been predicted either in e. coli or in other species, except for yebc. the e. coli ychf protein belongs to a group of  <dig> universally conserved gtpases  <cit> . studies in haemophilus influenzae have shown that ychf contains binding sites for both gtp and double-stranded nucleic acid, indicating that ychf may be part of a nucleoprotein complex and function as a gtp-dependant translation factor  <cit> . rlud encodes a pseudouridine synthase in e. coli which is responsible for the production of 23s rrna pseudouridines  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . this protein is non-essential in e. coli, but affects growth  <cit> . sp <dig>  which is transcribed upstream of the pneumococcal homolog to rlud has been identified as essential for lung infection in mice in a signature mutagenesis screen   <cit> . smf has a homologue in h. pylori, b. subtilis, and streptococcus pneumoniae, named dpra , and is involved in natural competence  <cit> . it has only been linked to virulence in yersinia and n. meningitidis  <cit> . the pneumococcal dpra protein is proposed to play a role in the late stage of transformation, by binding to incoming single stranded dna and bringing it to the reca recombinase. finally, hemk in e. coli encodes an n-glutamine methyltransferase that modifies peptide release factors  <cit> .

insertion-deletion mutants  were constructed for all five genes, ychf, rlud, smf, hemk and yebc in the tigr <dig> background. defects in in vitro growth were observed for mutants in ychf, hemk and yebc respectively, where the hemk-deficient mutant was most severely attenuated with an 80% longer generation time as compared to the wild-type tigr <dig>  in an intranasal mouse model of infection, mutations that did not affect in vitro fitness, i.e. rlud and smf, did not influence virulence, while all mutants with growth defects  were also attenuated in virulence. the reduction of virulence correlated to the extent of growth defect observed. hence, the hemk mutant was most attenuated, but still capable of causing severe invasive disease in 27% of the animals. long-term colonization of the upper airways was not affected by any of the mutants. thus, fitness defects reducing growth rate in vitro did not affect non-symptomatic carriage, but affected the likelihood of transition from carriage to invasive disease. however, once invasive disease occurred there was no apparent effect of a fitness defect on the progression of invasive disease.

for the mutants in ychf  and yebc , we did not investigate possible effects on neighboring genes. the pneumococcal homologue to ychf was reported as potentially essential by thanassi et al., but song et al. showed that this effect was due to polarity  <cit> . instead song et al. identified spr <dig>  the r <dig> equivalent of sp <dig>  which is probably transcribed together with ychf, as essential. therefore, it is possible that the phenotype of our ychf insertion-deletion mutant is due to effects on sp <dig> or polar effects on another essential gene sp <dig>  <cit>  encoding a putative peptidyl-trna hydrolase. also in the case of yebc , interesting genes can be found in close proximity. about  <dig> kb downstream of yebc is ply, encoding the well-known pneumococcal virulence factor pneumolysin  <cit> . these genes are however not believed to be co-transcribed, since the ply gene is transcribed from its own promoter  <cit> .

in s. pneumoniae, hemk is the fourth gene out of eleven in an operon that has previously been reported to be associated with virulence  <cit> . two groups have reported the effects of mutations in hemk or the hemk operon in s. pneumoniae. while marra et al. observed a significant effect on virulence, orihuela et al. did not observe any attenuation  <cit> . hava and camilli identified sp <dig>  as essential for lung infection in mice using stm, but did not study the mutant further  <cit> . to investigate which gene in this operon was attributed to the observed defect in growth and virulence, we constructed in-frame mutants for hemk and the two genes downstream of hemk, sp <dig> and sp <dig>  the hemk-deficient insertion-deletion mutant showed smaller colonies on blood agar plates, hence we studied the in-frame mutants for this phenotype and found it only in the sp <dig> mutant. this mutant also had a considerably longer generation time in c+y as well as in th medium compared to the parental strain, which was not the case for the other in-frame mutants. also, the sp <dig> mutant was completely non-virulent in vivo, while the non-polar hemk in frame mutant gave wild-type virulence. in this set of experiments all derivatives used carried a mutation in rpsl giving streptomycin resistance. the lower virulence observed for tigr4s as compared to tigr <dig> is likely due to the fitness cost of this rpsl mutation as previously shown for salmonella typhimurium  <cit> . the complete attenuation of the in-frame mutation in sp <dig> likely reflects the added fitness defect contributed by the rpsl mutation. sp <dig> is a homologue to yrdc in e. coli, which was recently reported to be responsible for ribosome maturation  <cit>  and mutations in this gene resulted in severe defects in growth. non-ribosomal factors in ribosome subunit assembly such as yrdc are emerging targets for new antibacterial drugs  <cit> . we cannot rule out that also sp <dig>  may be involved in virulence, without affecting in vitro fitness. sp <dig> was picked up in an stm screen by hava and camilli  <cit> . the method used by hava and camilli to construct the mutant library may have lead to effects on the expression from neighboring genes within the operons of the targeted genes. hence, it is possible that the phenotype reported for sp <dig> is due to effects on yrdc  expression.

CONCLUSIONS
here we found support both among our clinical isolates studied as well as among the constructed mutants that in vitro growth affects invasiveness in vivo. however, all tigr <dig> mutants with reduced growth rate remained capable of causing severe invasive disease in a fraction of mice, and were still able to colonize the upper airways to the same level as the wild-type strain. also, the slowly growing st <dig> isolate of serotype  <dig>  was isolated from the nasopharynx of a human being. our results therefore suggest that pneumococci with metabolic or other fitness defects may prevail in the carrier population, and potentially also cause invasive disease. such strains could possibly act as reservoir for the build up of better-fit strains that also are more capable of generating invasive disease. it is surprising that so many pneumococcal loci have been shown, by signature-tagged mutagenesis, to be required for virulence in mice  <cit> . revisiting this collection of mutants, asking which ones also exhibit in vitro fitness defects, may significantly reduce the number of pneumococcal loci that are directly involved in overcoming host defenses during invasive disease. furthermore, it may be fruitful to identify conserved surface-exposed proteins that provide a growth defect when inactivated and use these proteins as drug targets or as recently reported as vaccine targets  <cit> .
