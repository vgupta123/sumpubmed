BACKGROUND
copy number variations  have been shown to account for substantial portions of genomic variation in humans. gains or losses in genomic regions varying from 50 bp to several megabases  in size have been estimated to cover  <dig>  % of the human genome   <cit> . cnvs have also been shown to cause changes in transcription levels of specific genes and may be an important source of material for evolutionary mechanisms to act upon  <cit> . approximately half of observed human cnvs span regions containing protein-coding genes  <cit>  known to be involved in essential cellular functions, general metabolism and the onset of different diseases , and which may influence disease susceptibility . cnv alterations have also been observed in primary and metastatic cancerous tissues  and to be associated with various genetic traits  <cit> .

most reported broad population-oriented studies for cnv detection use at least two main platforms: comparative genomic hybridization  arrays and snp genotyping arrays . advantages and disadvantages associated with these platforms have been widely discussed in the literature . however, with the advent and rapidly decreasing costs of next generation sequencing , studying cnvs with sequencing data has also become increasingly feasible  <cit> . the main advantages of sequencing over genotyping lie in the improved resolution of cnv identification, and particularly in the fact that searches for cnvs are not limited to specific, pre-defined regions. ngs protocols randomly generate reads and therefore close to the entire genome can be sampled with high coverage and resolution, thus promoting higher accuracy in cnv detection and greater precision when estimating breakpoints  <cit> .

studies to identify and catalogue cnvs have been successfully performed on animals of economic importance, including catlle , chicken  <cit> , pig  <cit> , sheep  <cit>  and goat  <cit> . a large number of cnvs were identified in taurine  and zebuine cattle  in regions containing genes known to affect complex traits  <cit> . the overlap of cnvs reported among animals of different taurine breeds is greater than the overlap between taurine and indicine cattle while, even though analyses were performed with data from a single nelore  sample, zebu cattle were observed to have the largest cnv diversity among studied breeds  <cit> .

the present study is the first to widely and deeply analyze a population of nelore  cattle composed of  <dig>  animals that were genotyped at high density . in addition, eight key ancestral bulls were resequenced with minimal coverage of 20×. the goal of this study was to perform a high-resolution analysis to detect and characterize cnvs in this breed while also estimating breed-specific variant frequencies.

RESULTS
genome-wide discovery and distribution of cnvs
a total of  <dig>  cnvs representing  <dig>  single copy duplications,  <dig>  double copy duplications,  <dig>  single copy deletions, and  <dig> double copy deletions  were detected with the analysis of genotyping data from  <dig>  nelore samples which passed data qc procedures. figure  <dig> shows the chromosome distribution of all detected cnvs. a total of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> cnvs were observed in > <dig>  > <dig> and >10 % of the samples analyzed, respectively.fig.  <dig> chromosome distribution of cnvs detected with high-density snp genotyping data from nelore cattle



the number of snps in each detected cnv varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  . cnv length varied from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  mbp . figure  <dig>  shows the size distribution of detected cnvs. observed cnvs larger than the average by one standard deviation or more  and with a frequency greater than 1 % were rare and far apart , with a mean frequency of  <dig>  %.fig.  <dig> size distribution of cnvs detected using nelore genotyping data



cnvr identification
different methods for condensing overlapping cnvs into copy number variant regions  have been proposed . nelore cnvrs were identified using jm-cnv  <cit> , which considers cnv length and frequency, removes extremely long or infrequent cnvs from the initial analysis, and resolves observed breakpoint issues  <cit> . the  <dig>  detected cnvs were condensed into  <dig>  cnvrs , representing a total coverage of  <dig>  gigabases  of the bovine autosomal genome . a total of  <dig>  duplications,  <dig> deletions, and  <dig>  duplications and deletions were observed in the identified cnvrs . a high positive correlation between the number of detected cnvrs and the size of bovine chromosomes was observed , contrary to what was observed in terms of the number of total cnvs detected .fig.  <dig> distribution of cnvrs detected using nelore snp genotyping data across bovine chromosomes

fig.  <dig> distribution of gain, loss and mixed cnvrs detected across the nelore genome . a cnvrs detected with genotyping data. b cnvrs <5 mb detected with ngs data



cnvr length varied from  <dig>  kbp to  <dig>  mbp . bta <dig> was found to have the highest number of cnvrs , while bta <dig> had the lowest number  of cnvrs . as for the average distance between cnvrs, bta <dig> and bta <dig> were found to have the greatest  and the smallest  distances, respectively. a total of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> cnvrs showed frequencies > <dig>  > <dig> and >10 % in the studied samples, respectively.fig.  <dig> size distribution of cnvrs detected using nelore genotyping data



cnvs in ngs data
lumpy  <cit>  uses signal depth from observed split-reads and from miss-mapped paired-end reads as evidence to identify cnvs. a total of  <dig>  cnvs distributed non-uniformly  along the  <dig> autosomes, representing  <dig> duplications and  <dig>  deletions, with average sizes of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kbp and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kbp, respectively, were detected in ngs data from eight resequenced bulls when both types of evidence were considered .fig.  <dig> chromosome distribution of cnvs detected using nelore ngs data



even though the analyzed ngs dataset was exceedingly smaller than the snp dataset , and represents a reduced sample of the breed’s genetic diversity, lumpy detected more than ten times the number of cnvs detected with penncnv, when the same eight animals were considered. similar results have been reported in other studies  <cit>  and may be attributed to the better resolution of cnv breakpoints which can be obtained from ngs data. moreover, the cnv ratio of deletions to duplications observed in the results obtained from ngs data  is more than  <dig> times larger than the ratio obtained from genotyping data , suggesting the method is more sensitive in identifying deletions. jm-cnv  <cit>  was used to converge identified cnvs > <dig>  bp into cnvrs. the  <dig>  detected cnvs were condensed into  <dig>  cnvrs, representing a total of  <dig> duplications,  <dig> deletions, and  <dig>  duplications and deletions . inevitable ascertainment bias may have influenced obtained results, as the reference bovine genome sequence was derived from a hereford individual . future analysis may be used to identify and correct this when a reliable bos indicus reference sequence becomes available.

cnv and cnvr independent validation and cross-referencing
the importance of comparing cnv detection results with complementary techniques, such as qpcr, fish, cgh arrays, snp arrays, and sequencing has been extensively reviewed in cattle  <cit> . cross-validation of cnvs detected in the genotyping data was performed with ngs data from the eight resequenced animals. a total of  <dig> cnvs were detected with genotyping data from the eight animals  and  <dig>  of these overlapped with 50 bp or more of at least one of  <dig>  cnvs identified with lumpy using evidence from split-reads and/or miss-mapped paired-end reads - table  <dig> . further evaluation of the  <dig> cnvs identified using snp and ngs data revealed that  <dig> were identified with all three independent types of evidence , while  <dig> were identified with at least two types of evidence .table  <dig> summary of cnvs detected using snp and resequencing data



a total of  <dig> of the  <dig> cnvs  were observed to contain mixed segments of duplications or deletions considering mostly the ngs data , which should be considered in future studies as complexity negatively correlates with reproducibility in subsequent cnv studies with different platforms  <cit> . the high proportion of observed cross-validated cnvs was contrasted with results reported by previous studies  <cit> . observed results show that some cnvs detected with genotyping data overlap with multiple smaller cnvs detected with ngs data , confirming previous reports  <cit>  which show that ngs offers higher resolution and precision for identification of cnv boundaries.fig.  <dig> number of non-redundant cnvs  detected using genotyping and ngs data

a total of  <dig>  cnvs identified with the snp dataset were cross-matched with  <dig> cnvrs previously validated with at least two distinct methods available at dvgarcheive database  and in the literature  <cit> . a total of 62 %  of previously validated cattle cnvrs were found to overlap with cnvs identified in nelore cattle, considering a minimum of 10 kb of overlap  <cit> . cnvs with frequencies >1 % were observed in  <dig> of these previously reported cnvrs in the analyzed nelore samples .

bickhart et al.  <cit>  reported  <dig> nelore cnvs from analyses of ngs data from a single animal, considering btau <dig>  as reference assembly. conversion of btau <dig>  to umd <dig>  coordinates using liftover  <cit>  resulted in  <dig> cnvs and a total of  <dig>  of these were found to overlap with one or more of the cnvs currently identified in the ngs data. observed discrepancies may have resulted from specificities of applied methods as well as sampling bias caused by the extremely reduced sample size used by  <cit> .

cnvrs in regions containing qtls in cattle
recent studies  <cit>  revealed cnv variants associated with production traits in dairy and beef cattle. reported findings suggest that models combining snp and cnv data could be more powerful at capturing the underlying variation and therefore provide more accurate frameworks to better account for the heritability of complex traits, as the effect of 25 % of identified cnvs could not be accounted for by neighboring snps  <cit> .

cnvrs have been detected in genomic regions shown to contain cattle qtls and have been shown to affect body measurements  <cit> , production traits  <cit>  and parasite resistance  <cit> . the  <dig>  cnvrs detected with genotyping data were compared to the  <dig>  regions of the bovine genome reported to contain qtls . a total of  <dig>  %  of the detected cnvrs, which encompass a total of 312mbp of the bovine autosomal genome, were observed to overlap by >50 %  <cit>  of  <dig> non-redundant qtls associated with economically important production traits such as residual feed intake, gestation length, marbling score, fat thickness at the twelfth rib, dry matter intake, longissimus muscle area, clinical mastitis, and carcass weight .

all of the  <dig> cnvs found by  <cit>  to be associated with milk production traits in holsteins  were also observed in nelore  cattle . comparisons of estimated frequencies of these cnvs in the two breeds revealed  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> regions in high , low  and divergent  frequencies, respectively. figure  <dig> shows chromosome positions and frequency differences between nelore and holstein cattle at these cnvs.fig.  <dig> chromosome distribution of relative cnv estimated frequencies in nelore  and holstein  cattle  <cit> 



considering the distinct selective pressures nelore and holstein cattle have been historically under either naturally  or artificially , frequency deviations are expected in underlying variant regions controlling traits under selection. cnvr_ <dig> was observed in  <dig>  % of the nelore samples tested, while a cnv located in the same position at frequency of  <dig>  % was reported to be strongly associated with protein percentage in holsteins . this genome region harbors qtl controlling carcass weight , milk fat percentage  and milk protein percentage , and the observed frequencies suggest the cnv may be under positive selection in nelore while strong negative selection in holsteins. a similar pattern of frequency divergence can be observed with cnvr_ <dig>  conversely, cnvr_ <dig>  cnvr_ <dig> and cnvr_ <dig>  located in regions reported to contain qtl affecting beef production traits, were observed at low frequencies in nelore cattle  and at high frequencies in holsteins , suggesting these cnvs may contribute to the underlying variation in traits under divergent selection in these breeds. these observations suggest that more extensive studies with cnv data from divergent breeds or other population structures could help identify signatures of selection in genome regions containing segmental variations.

gene ontology and cnvrs
the occurrence of cnvs in genome regions containing functional genes may create opportunities for the emergence of new allelic variants, gene isoforms, and complex mechanisms of gene expression control as a consequence of naturally occurring evolutionary processes. a total of  <dig>  cnvrs  are located within genome regions containing  <dig>  annotated genes, which can be functionally classified as protein coding , microrna , snorna , snrna , miscrna , and rrna .

automated annotation of these genes with go terms revealed important categories, including metabolic and cellular processes, biological regulation, response to stimulus, cell signaling, reproduction, and growth . many well described contrasting traits between taurine and zebu cattle have been targets of natural selection and production-oriented genetic improvement, and are mediated by genes involved in these biological processes, including reproduction   <cit> , resistance to endo- and ectoparasites  <cit> , heat tolerance  <cit> , disease resistance  <cit> , as well as growth and carcass and meat quality traits  <cit> . therefore, further investigation of these regions may unveil important information for understanding underlying mechanisms affecting economically important traits.fig.  <dig> go annotation for biological processes of cnvs detected in nelore cattle



previous studies to identify cnvs in cattle using small numbers of samples from divergent breeds have focused specially on comparisons between breeds  <cit>  and may have provided a comprehensive view of breed-specific cnvs potentially associated with contrasting traits observed among evaluted breeds. analysis of  <dig>  nelore samples allowed a broad identification of cnvs segregating within the breed in addition to generating population frequency estimates and therefore providing crucial information for inference if observed cnvs may indeed be under selection within the breed. several previously reported cnvs  within genome regions containing genes that may control traits of interest for cattle production were observed at extremely low frequencies in the population studied herein , indicating that these variants may not be positively associated with underlying factors associated with traits under positive selection in the breed.

sequencing of the bovine reference genome revealed the expansion of the antimicrobial cathelicidin gene, found as a single copy in humans and mice, into a large gene family in cattle  <cit>  . bickhart et al.  <cit>  reported that one of these cathelicidin genes  was observed to be highly duplicated in the single evaluated nelore sample. a single copy duplication spanning this gene was observed in both snp and ngs data but at frequencies <1 %, indicating this particular cnv is not undergoing strong positive selection in the breed . similar divergent results were observed with other genes previously reported to be located in genome regions with cnvs in nelore cattle and that have been independently shown to affect height , lipid metabolism , transport , endoparasite resistance , and oxidative metabolism  .

genetic imprinting represents a major mechanism of epigenetic regulation of gene expression leading to parent-specific differential expression of a subset of  <dig> bovine genes  and dna sequence polymorphisms in imprinted genes have been shown to affect production traits in cattle  <cit> . cnvs were observed in regions spanning  <dig> imprinted genes in nelore cattle: mesoderm specific transcript - mest , nucleosome assembly protein  <dig> like  <dig> - nap1l <dig> , insulin like growth factor  <dig> receptor - igf2r , neuronatin - nnat , antisense transcript gene of peg <dig> - apeg <dig> , maternally expressed  <dig> - meg <dig> , pleckstrin homology like domain family a member  <dig> - phlda <dig> , tumor-suppressing subchromosomal transferable fragment  <dig> - tssc <dig> , achaete-scute family bhlh transcription factor  <dig> - ascl <dig> , insulin like growth factor  <dig> - igf <dig> , and h <dig>  .

observed cnv frequencies in regions harboring mest, nap1l <dig>  igf2r, nnat, apeg <dig>  and meg <dig> were very low . conversely, cnv frequencies in the region with imprinted genes on bta <dig>  were greater than 9 %. the phlda <dig> gene  is located in the aforementioned region of bta <dig> and is expressed in the bovine placenta and embryonic tissues during pregnancy  <cit> . comparisons of bovine and human polypeptides revealed a strong homology and suggested that phlda <dig> could be involved in the same regulatory pathways in both species  <cit> . according to huang et al.  <cit> , proper phlda <dig> expression is essential for normal embryo development during early development. additional studies show that phlda <dig> may affect the development of bovine pre-implantation embryos  <cit> . a single copy duplication in the region containing phlda <dig> was observed in a total of  <dig> individuals  and should be considered in future studies to evaluate the effect of this gene in early embryo development.

annotation of most frequent cnvrs in nelore cattle
cnvs with frequencies higher than 1 % were observed in a total of 13 %  of the detected cnvrs . six cnvrs were observed to be highly frequent in nelore, with more than  <dig>  cnvs in the analyzed samples and may therefore be associated with underlying factors positively affecting traits under selection in the breed.fig.  <dig> frequency distribution of cnvrs detected using snp genotyping data from a population of  <dig>  nelore cattle



bta2: <dig> ,165- <dig> , <dig> contains a duplication that was observed in a total of  <dig>  individuals. this genome region harbors genes such as insulin-like growth factor binding protein  <dig>  and short stature homeobox , among others. studies in humans show that mutations in this gene can lead to short stature and to different pathological conditions such as turner syndrome , léri-weill dyschondrosteosis, and langer mesomelic dysplasia . igfbp <dig> has also been shown to be involved in regulating the estrous cycle and early pregnancy in cattle  <cit> .

bta4: <dig> ,180– <dig> , <dig> contains  <dig> annotated genes, as well as microrna  <dig>  and was found to be duplicated in more than  <dig>  animals and one resequenced individual, and to be deleted in four genotyped animals. studies on humans show that cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig> , which is located in this region, plays an important role in central nervous system function. it has also been proposed that cdk <dig> is important in myogensis, hematopoietic cell differentiation, spermatogenesis, insulin secretion, and lens differentiation  <cit> . a study with pigs showed that cdk <dig> is involved in brain development  <cit> .

bta6: <dig> ,914– <dig> , <dig> contains actin binding lim protein family member  <dig> , actin filament associated protein  <dig> , sortilin related vps <dig> domain containing receptor  <dig> , prosaposin-like  <dig> , and sh <dig> domain and tetratricopeptide repeats  <dig> . this cnvr was found to be duplicated in more than  <dig>  animals and deleted in  <dig> animals. klimov et al. showed that the ablim <dig> protein is necessary for normal neuron functioning  <cit> . sorcs <dig> was identified as a proneurotrophin receptor and is expressed as a single-chain protein that is essential for probdnf-induced growth cane collapse in developing dopaminergic processes. deficiency of sorcs <dig> in mice caused reduced dopamine levels and metabolism, and dopaminergic hyperinnervation of the frontal cortex  <cit> .

bta19: <dig> ,331– <dig> , <dig> harbors angiotensin i converting enzyme , wd <dig> repeat-containing protein , and potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily h member  <dig> . the ace gene encodes an enzyme involved in catalyzing the conversion of angiotensin i into angiotensin ii, which is a potent vasopressor that controls blood pressure and fluid-electrolyte balance. gauthier et al.  demonstrated that ace inhibitor-enhanced bradykinin relaxations of bovine coronary arteries occurs through endothelial cell b <dig> receptor activation and nitric oxide  <cit> .

bta19: <dig> ,097– <dig> , <dig> contains protein kinase c alpha , calcium voltage gated channel auxiliary subunit gamma  <dig> , and calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit gamma  <dig>  genes, as well as the 7sk misc-rna and was found to be duplicated in more than  <dig>  animals and deleted in  <dig> animals in the population studied. a study on cattle showed that 7sk misc-rna is located on a central region of the hexamethylene bis-acetamide inducible  <dig>  gene and may play an important role in gene regulation  <cit> . the authors proposed that this gene affects the latent life cycle of the bovine immunodeficiency virus , which leads to a lack of clinical signs of the disease in affected animals. this region may be of interest for studies on the clinical diagnosis and prevention of this disease.

CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first comprehensive cnv survey within the nelore breed . obtained results allowed for direct comparisons of cnv detection results with two distinct platforms , and with previous reports from independent studies.

the bovine cnv map was significantly enriched, particularly for the nelore breed and associated variant frequency estimates enabled the identification of variants potentially associated with traits under selection, particularly in genome regions harboring qtls affecting production traits.

obtained results suggest that more extensive studies using cnv data from divergent breeds with differing population structures could help identify signatures of selection using approaches frequently used with snp data. the study provides important information that may inspire or contribute to future studies on the association between cnvs and production traits important for genetic improvement in cattle.
