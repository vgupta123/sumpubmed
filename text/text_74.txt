BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a group of endogenous ~22 nt small non-coding rnas that can modulate gene expression by inhibiting mrna translation or regulating mrna degradation at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . it was once estimated that known mirnas account for around 1% of predicted genes in higher eukaryotic genomes and that up to 30% of genes might be regulated by mirnas  <cit> . mirnas regulation have been implicated in varied physiological processes including cell proliferation  <cit> , differentiation  <cit> , apoptosis  <cit> , tumorigenesis  <cit> , hormone secretion  <cit> , metabolism  <cit>  and reproduction control  <cit> . on goat’s mirna study, researchers have focused their interest on mammary gland of dairy goat  <cit> , hair follicle of cashmere goat  <cit>  and muscle or reproduction of meat goat  <cit> . a recent study showed that over-expression of mir- <dig> in goat’s mammary gland epithelial cells increased transcription of genes associated with milk fat synthesis, resulted in an up-regulation of fat droplet formation, triglyceride accumulation, and the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids  <cit> . mirnas research in animal ovary has been extensively explored with the improvement of study methods. mirs- <dig> and mirs- <dig> were discovered in pig ovary by homology analysis and confirmed with northern blot  <cit> . cloning technique had been adopted to identify mirnas expressed in mice ovary, obtained a total of  <dig> mirnas from the ovaries of 2-wk-old and adult mice  <cit> . a mouse mutant with a ~75% loss of dicer <dig> mirna levels was predicted to cause the decreasing of angiogenesis in the corpus luteum ultimately resulted in female infertility. on further study, the mir-17-5p and let-7b which regulate the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase  <dig> had been proved contributed to the mutant mouse’s infertility  <cit> . in  <dig>  the different expression of mirnas in the ovaries of pregnant and non-pregnant anhui white goats was identified and analyzed,  <dig> conserved and  <dig> putative novel mirna in hircine ovaries had been detected by high-throughput sequencing  <cit> .

superior kidding rate is an important economic trait in production of meat goat, while ovulation rate is the precondition of kidding rate  <cit> . follicular phase accompanied by the increasing of fsh, is the phase including of follicle recruitment and dominant follicle development. multiple follicle development and ovulation have been attributed to higher elevations of fsh above the threshold level . researchers had discovered that bone morphogenetic protein  <dig>  and growth differentiation factor  <dig>  contribute to all stages of follicular development including activation of the primordial follicles  <cit> . james et al. mutated the genes for oocyte-derived growth factors gdf <dig> and bmp <dig> which were associated with both increased ovulation rate and sterility in cambridge and belclare sheep  <cit> . there are also specific genes, for example the fecb or booroola gene, that result in ovulation rates greater than five  <cit> . in recent years, many studies indicated that mirnas play critical roles in almost all ovarian biological processes, including folliculogenesis, follicle development, follicle atresia, luteal development and regression . the anhui white goat is known for its precocious puberty, higher fertility, and higher leather quality compared with other types of goat. anhui white goat ewes can estrus all year round. the average anhui white goat kidding rate is 227-239% which is belong to varieties of high kidding rate in goats. it is therefore an ideal model for the study of goat breeding traits.

in the present study, we characterized and investigated the differential expression of mirnas in the ovaries of multiple and uniparous anhui white goats using deep sequencing technology. the result will help to further understand the role of mirnas in kidding rate regulation and also may help to identify mirnas which could be potentially used to increase hircine ovulation rate and kidding rate in the future.

RESULTS
overview of sequencing data
in order to identify differentially expressed mirna during follicular phase in the ovaries of multiple and uniparous anhui white goats, two small rna libraries were constructed by solexa sequencing. a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were obtained. after discarding the sequences shorter than 18 nt, eliminating low-quality sequences and removing contaminants formed by adapter-adapter ligation, reads without 3’ligation and insert tags were obtained. ultimately,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads which obtained from multiple and uniparous goats remained for further analysis . subsequently, all identical sequence reads were classified as groups, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique sequences were obtained . the length distribution of the reads was similar between the two libraries . the majority of the small rna were 20-24 nt range. sequences 22 nt in length, the typical size of dicer-derived products  <cit> , peaked at length distribution, respectively accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total sequence reads in the multiple and uniparous libraries.table  <dig>

for assessing the efficiency of solexa sequencing and the quality of sequence itself, all of the clean reads were annotated and classified by aligning against the rfam <dig>  database, genbank and the mirbase <dig>  database. however, some srna tags may be mapped to more than one category. to make every unique small rnas mapped to only one annotation, we followed the following priority rule: rrnaetc  > known mirna > repeat > exon > intron  <cit> . all of the clean reads were divided into the following categories: exon_antisense, exon_sense, intron_antisense, intron_sense, mirna, rrna, repeat, scrna, snrna, snorna, srprna, trna, unan . the composition of the rna classes in each library was shown in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the proportion of total rrna is a mark for sample quality check. usually it should be less than 60% in plant samples  <cit>  and 40% in animal samples as high quality . the proportion of total rrna was  <dig> % and  <dig> % in multiple and uniparous librariy respectively, indicating that the ovaries samples collected were of high quality in this study. in order to analyze the two libraries expression and distribution, all of the clean solexa reads were mapped to the goat genome sequence using soap software. in the clean reads of multiple and uniparous libraries,  <dig> , <dig> reads  and  <dig> , <dig> reads  were mapped to the goat genome . conserved mirnas accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total clean reads, and accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the unique reads  in the multiple and uniparous small rna libraries, respectively. the result of two libraries showed that the majority of total reads was classified as mirna, which suggested that the sequencing of present study was successful. however, the highest fraction of unique reads was attributed to unann, and the length distribution of its small rna was mainly round about 20-24 nt . therefore, just like which had be reported before that there are still many kind of mirna waiting to be found for us  <cit> .figure  <dig>

differential expression of conserved mirnas in the ovaries of multiple and uniparous goats during follicular phase
since there is no mirnas information of goat in the mirbase  <dig>  database, we aligned the clean reads to the mirna precursor/mature mirnas of all known animals in the mirbase  <dig>  database. the sequence and count of families  were obtained which could be found in the two libraries . considering little mismatches between sequences,  <dig> and  <dig> conserved mirnas were identified in the multiple and uniparous libraries. among them,  <dig> mirnas were co-expressed,  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were specifically expressed in the multiple and uniparous libraries, respectively. the overwhelming majority of these specifically expressed mirnas’ expression level were very low , whereas the expression level of  <dig>  and  <dig>  specific expressed mirnas in multiple and uniparous libraries were higher than  <dig> . the highest specific expressed mirna in multiple library was mir-29c which reached counts of  <dig>  , and the highest specific expressed mirna in uniparous library was mir- <dig> which reached counts of  <dig>  .table  <dig>

the differentially expressed mirnas between the two libraries were showed in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the same as previous study on mirna detecting  <cit> , most of its expression quantity were equivalent, while there were also some mirnas expressed differently between the two experimental group .  <dig> % of the mirnas expression was not significant,  <dig> % of the mirnas were significantly different  and  <dig> % of the mirnas were significantly different  in the multiple and uniparous libraries. the  <dig> most highly expressed mirnas  in the multiple library were also the highest expressed in the uniparous library, and there were no significantly different between each other.figure  <dig>

identification of potential novel mirnas
the characteristic hairpin structure of mirna precursor can be used to predict novel mirna. the novel mirnas were predicted by mireap software  through mapping the precursor to goat genome sequences. novel mirnas presumed by exploring the secondary structure, the dicer cleavage site and the minimum free energy of the unannotated small rna reads.  <dig> potential novel mirnas were detected in total, of which  <dig> potential novel mirnas were co-expressed,  <dig> and  <dig> potential novel mirnas were specifically expressed in the multiple and uniparous libraries, respectively . the length of the novel mirna sequences also ranged from  <dig> to 24 nt, and these novel mirnas were not analyzed further, as their expression quantity were very low.

target gene prediction for mirnas
mirnas modulate gene expression by inhibiting mrna translation or regulating mrna degradation at the post-transcriptional level based on pairing between the 5’ end of the mirna  and the 3’ untranslated regions  of target mrnas . mireap software was used to predict target genes of the mirna by searching the goat reference gene database . in the multiple library,  <dig> , <dig> target sites in  <dig>  target genes were predicted for  <dig>  conserved mirnas, and  <dig>  target sites in  <dig>  target genes were predicted for  <dig> novel mirnas. in the uniparous library,  <dig> , <dig> target sites in  <dig>  target genes were predicted for  <dig>  conserved, and  <dig>  target sites into  <dig>  target genes were predicted for  <dig> novel mirnas.

gene ontology  enrichment and kegg pathway analysis of target genes
go is an international standarized classification system for gene function, which supplies a set of controlled vocabulary to comprehensively describe the property of genes and gene products. there are  <dig> ontologies in go: cellular component, molecular function and biological process. the basic unit of go is go-term, each of which belongs to one type of ontology. in this study, go enrichment analysis was used for predicting candidate target genes of all detected mirnas. in additional file  <dig>  go enrichment for gene background based on the cellular component showed that  <dig>  genes were mapped to go terms in the database . for all mirnas target genes of multiple and uniparous goats in the ovaries during follicular phase, there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  target genes mapped to the go terms of cellular component. compared to the reference gene background,  <dig> and  <dig> go terms were significantly  enriched for multiple and uniparous libraries respectively based on the cellular component. analysis of molecular function showed that  <dig>  genes were assigned different functions based on gene background, while  <dig>  and  <dig>  target genes were involved for multiple and uniparous libraries. compared to the reference gene background,  <dig> and  <dig> go terms were significantly  enriched for multiple and uniparous libraries respectively based on molecular function. for the reference gene background,  <dig>  genes were related to biological processes. however,  <dig>  and  <dig>  target genes were related to the biological processes of go terms for multiple and uniparous libraries. compared to the reference gene background,  <dig> and  <dig> go terms were significantly  enriched for multiple and uniparous libraries respectively based on biological processes.

kegg pathway annotation showed that  <dig>  background genes were annotated for  <dig> biological functions. however,  <dig>  and  <dig>  target genes were annotated to the relevant biological functions for multiple and uniparous goats in the ovaries during follicular phase. the only over-represented mirna targets belonged to the olfactory transduction pathways in uniparous library, while there  <dig> pathways were significantly  enriched in multiple library .

quantitative rt-pcr validation
the expression levels of  <dig>  randomly selected mirnas were verified in the ovaries of multiple and uniparous goats during follicular phase using rt-pcr. the relative expression levels of  <dig> selected mirnas were consistent with the solexa sequencing results since they had a similar trend of expression in two libraries .figure  <dig>

discussion
economic efficiency of a flock of goats is dependent on its total productivity, and the productivity is more dependent on fertility and prolificacy of the female goats than any other components . however, hircine fecundity is relatively low  <cit> , and the trait is difficult to improvement by conventional breeding methods for its low heritability which ranged  <dig>  to  <dig>  based on the study of zhang et al.  <cit> . therefore, researchers pin their hope on molecular assisted breeding technology, and the research of mirna in reproduction thrived  <cit> . in this study, we sequenced the small rnas in the ovarian tissues of multiple and uniparous anhui white goats during follicular phase by illumina solexa technology, then analyzed the differentially expressed mirnas, predicted novel mirnas, and made go enrichment and kegg pathway analysis of target genes in two mirna libraries.

compare to researches carried by predecessors  <cit> , more conserved mirnas  were identified in this study. there are two principal reasons contributing to these results. the first reason is that the detected clean reads was aligned to the latest database of mirbase  <dig>  released in june  <dig>  while  <dig> new hairpin sequences and  <dig> new mature micrornas from around  <dig> new publications were added to the database based on mirbase  <dig> , increasing the totals to  <dig> hairpin sequences and  <dig> mature sequences in all . and the mir/mir* nomenclature is finally replaced by the -5p/-3p nomenclature after mirbase  <dig> , the result leading to mirna* which was not reckoned in real conversed mirna once, now named -5p or -3p; ultimately duplex-like mirna:mirna* what was regarded to be one mirna turned out to be two. the second reason is that the two libraries were compared with all animals in the mirbase  <dig>  for there is no mirnas information of goat in it, and the reference data was species widely.

in ovaries between multiple and uniparous goats of follicular phase,  <dig> novel mirnas were predicted in total, which is distinctly more than the amount predicted in our previous study  implemented by our team workers, zhang et al.  <cit> . for this result, a central factor is should be attributed to the new reference of goat genome which published in december  <dig> when the study of zhang et al. had been completed, and they simply identified novel mirnas by means of alignment with goat expressed sequence tags . it worth to point out is that  <dig>  of the  <dig> novel mirnas sequence is consistent with the sequence  predicted in our previous study. this result may hint that the sequence should be a greater likelihood of a potential new mirna.

in sheep, selection for superior lambing rate has been showed to alter ovulation rate primarily  <cit> . and it has been suggested that increased ovulation rates could be due to a wider window of time for follicle recruitment or an increase in the numbers of follicles recruited in ovaries  <cit> . to find out the different ovarian activity and follicle recruitment in multiple and uniparous goats of follicular phase, differentially expressed mirna were identified in the two constructed libraries. the  <dig> most highly expressed mirnas in the multiple library were mainly consistent with that in the uniparous library, and there were no significant difference in expression between two libraries. this result was ascribed to the same physiological phase  in ovaries of two experimental groups. mir- <dig> was verified in regulation of apoptosis in vivo, and related with ovulation rate  <cit> . however, the expression of mir- <dig> also have no significant difference between multiple and uniparous groups in this study. then, we turned our attention to the specific expressed mirnas. the highest specific expressed mirna in multiple library was mir-29c, and the one in uniparous library was mir- <dig>  as aligning the clean reads to the mirna precursor/mature mirnas of all animals in the mirbase  <dig>  database, and obtained mirna with no specifid species. carefully analyzed mir-29c and mir- <dig> in the present study, we found that the sequence of mir-29c was consistent with ola-mir-29c , the sequence of mir- <dig> endured some mismatch with mmu-mir- <dig> . mir-29c was in the same family with mir-29a, which was significantly down-regulated after 12 h fsh treatment, while its expression increased after 48 h fsh treatment  <cit> . therefore, it was supposed that mir-29c was also related with fsh secretion which may influence on follicles recruiting in the present study, and it need further experimentation certainly. as for mir- <dig>  there is no research reported on ovary so far and mirbase recorded the mmu-mir- <dig> by reference the article of david  <cit> . in consideration of specific and higher level expression of mir- <dig> in uniparous group, some further experimentation also worth to be done.

go annotation and kegg pathway analyses are able to obtain a better understanding from the cellular components, molecular functions and biological processes of target genes  <cit> . start with go analysis, mirna targets were significantly enriched to different terms in two libraries, and the significantly enriched terms in uniparous library contained the terms in multiple library. as for kegg pathway analysis, it is worth to note that focal adhesion, abc transporters, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, peroxisome, starch and sucrose metabolism, and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation were involved in the significantly enriched pathway in the ovaries during follicular phase of multiple goats. these significantly enriched pathways may imply that the organism was coping to the criteria of follicular phase in multiple goats. go annotation and kegg pathway analyses can provide a reference to us for the later research.

rt-pcr was carried out to analyze the expression of  <dig> randomly selected mirnas in multiple and uniparous hircine ovaries during follicular phase, and the results were consistent with the solexa sequencing data. however, the expression levels of every mirna need to be validated by rt-pcr in theory. hence, the identified mirnas in the present study can only be regard as a hircine ovary-specific mirna reference dataset. compared with previous study implemented by zhang et al. in our team  <cit> , which the ovaries tissues were from different physiological phase of pregnant and non-pregnant phase in the same goats, while the ovaries tissues in this study were from different goat of multiple and uniparous goats in the same follicular phase. therefore, the results of our previous study were caused by the different physiological phase, while the results of our present study were caused by the different genetic background. nevertheless, the potential of kidding rate is affected by many components, including ovulation rate, fertilization rate and embryo survival, any or all of which may be under genetic control  <cit> , and these need to be researched step by step.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary,  <dig> mirnas were co-expressed,  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were specifically expressed in the ovaries of multiple and uniparous goats during follicular phase. the highest specific expressed mirna in multiple library was mir-29c, and the highest specific expressed mirna in uniparous library was mir- <dig>   <dig> novel mirnas were predicted in total. go annotation and kegg pathway analyses were implemented on target genes of all mirna in two libraries, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation and other pathways were pointed out for significantly enriched. the result may help to further understand the role of mirnas in kidding rate regulation and also help to identify mirnas which could be potentially used to increase hircine ovulation rate and kidding rate in the future.
