BACKGROUND
iron deficiency anemia  is among the most common nutritional problems of human populations throughout the world, affecting more than  <dig> billion people to varying degrees  <cit> . while the deficiency is widespread, the lack of iron in the diet or inability to assimilate iron in sufficient quantities is most serious for children, adolescents, and women of child-bearing age  <cit> . iron is an essential element for human growth and development that is needed for the krebs cycle, for cytochrome function and for cellular respiration  <cit> . most of the iron in the human body is part of hemoglobin, myoglobin, ferritin or transferrin  <cit> .

various strategies are used to combat ida  <cit> . for example, supplementation with iron can be practiced at health centers through a liquid or injectable medicine. drawbacks are the taste of the liquid medicine, teeth staining and need for outreach and a delivery mechanism  <cit> . fortification is another approach for delivering iron to ida susceptible populations that is best done with flours produced from cereals but tends to be costly and is not an option for whole grains, like legumes. an alternative to both of these is to increase the concentration of iron in diets through biofortification of staple foods  <cit> . legumes are especially useful sources of micronutrients such as iron and have added advantage of high proteins. one important legume, common bean, has been targeted in the worldwide effort on biofortification as a strategic crop for increasing dietary iron for human beings.

common bean is a major food staple of eastern and southern africa and latin america and with a total production of c.  <dig> m tons is the most widely grown food legume around the world, being highly valued in international trade and in regional markets  <cit> . common bean like other legumes is known as the 'meat of the poor' due to their role as an economical alternative in the diets of people who cannot afford animal products. varieties of common bean grain can be classified into two major genepools based on seed size differences, with andean beans being large seeded and mesoamerican beans being small seeded. the genepools differ in many respects including some basic physiological properties as well as nutritional characteristics and dna polymorphisms. a range of results have shown that andean beans tend to have higher seed iron concentration than mesoamerican beans  <cit> .

iron reductases are members of the protein super-family of flavocytochromes and function in roots to convert iron from a plant unavailable form  to an available form  that can be readily absorbed  <cit> . an iron reductase protein  is located within the plasma membrane, especially in root epidermal cells, where it is required for iron reduction  <cit> . iron reductase activity is known to vary with plant growth conditions  and mutants in pea have been useful for analyzing the role of iron reduction in root iron acquisition  <cit> . combined with root iron transporters and perhaps the release of phenolics, fro is essential for iron uptake in strategy i plants that do not produce siderophores for iron capture from soil  <cit> .

the objective of this study was to evaluate iron reductase activity in common bean roots and to analyze the possible role of root iron reduction in the accumulation of seed iron. we did this by evaluating diverse germplasm grown at different iron concentrations for root iron reductase activity and then mapping quantitative trait loci for that activity in an inter-genepool cross population  that has been used for genetic mapping of seed iron concentration  <cit> . in addition, we identified two genetic markers for bean iron reductases and performed in silico mapping of a putative iron reductase gene  by synteny analysis between soybean, medicago and bean.

the analysis of iron reductase activity in common bean is part of a broader program of nutritional genomics being conducted within a biofortification program for common bean. genomics in common bean benefits from a small genome of approximately  <dig> mb  and substantial synteny with other legumes which have been fully characterized for expressed genes  or which have sequenced genomes  <cit> . synteny analysis within the legumes has been conducted by various authors  <cit>  and the common bean genome is known to be a simple diploid model of the soybean genome  <cit> . nutritional genomics was first described as the analysis and modification of genes involved in the pathways leading to nutrient accumulation  <cit> . the analysis of iron reductase activity, aside from potentially influencing nutritional quality, is also important for adaptation of common beans to iron deficient alkaline or calcareous soils  <cit> .

RESULTS
parental differences and germplasm diversity
the parents of the dor <dig> × g <dig> mapping population based on a high seed iron × low seed iron cross as described by blair et al.  <cit>  were evaluated in an initial randomized complete block experiment in the growth chamber with four replications to evaluate iron reductase activity across a range of iron concentrations that included  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm fe-eddha . similarly, a set of  <dig> wild and cultivated genotypes were evaluated in the same conditions but with only two iron concentrations, namely at limited iron  and iron sufficiency . the mapping population was then evaluated in additional randomized complete block experiments with the same conditions but with  <dig> μm fe used for the iron-limited treatment and  <dig> μm fe for the sufficiency treatment based on the results from the parental screening.

the first iron reductase assay identified interesting differences between the parents of the mapping population for their ability to reduce iron when grown at various hydroponic iron concentrations ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> μm fe . these differences were more evident in plants grown at low fe concentrations  than at high iron concentrations , such that g <dig> had its highest iron reductase activity when grown at  <dig> μm fe, while dor <dig> exhibited very low iron reductase activity when grown at  <dig> or  <dig> μm fe, but achieved higher rates when grown at  <dig> μm fe. at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm fe, the iron reductase activity of dor <dig> was slightly higher than that of g <dig>  but the differences were not significant.

to evaluate whether these results were typical of other common bean germplasm, we selected a range of nine cultivated landraces and four wild accessions from the ciat genebank collection  to determine the variability in iron reductase activity when plants were challenged with iron-limited  and iron sufficient  growth conditions. the genotypes selected for this experiment were based on their known seed iron concentrations from the evaluation of the ciat cultivated and wild core collections [ <dig>  ciat unpublished). among the cultivated genotypes, g <dig> was selected for being high for seed iron within the mesoamerican  genepool, while g <dig> was selected for being low in iron within this genepool. two other mesoamerican beans were also evaluated, as was one intermediate type between the andean and mesoamerican genepools.

1/*genepools: a = andean wild or cultivated, c = colombian wild, m = mesoamerican wild or cultivated.

within the andean  genepool, g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> were selected for being high in iron while g <dig> was selected for being low in iron concentration. the iron reductase activity was indeed higher in the genotypes with high seed iron than those with low seed iron, especially for g <dig> or g <dig>  the correlation within the cultivated genepools between seed iron concentration and iron reductase activity at  <dig> μm fe and at  <dig> μm fe were r =  <dig>  and r =  <dig> , respectively, with neither being significant. our interest in correlating iron reductase activity with seed iron concentration was part of our long term goal of evaluating whether iron reductase activity was potentially predictive of the eventual accumulation of iron in that genotype's seeds.

iron reductase activity differences were not evident between the cultivated genotypes from the andean versus the mesoamerican genepool based on t-tests at either growth iron concentration level, but this might have been due to the selection of genotypes for contrasting seed iron concentrations. there was some suggestion that andean beans had slightly higher iron reductase activity when grown at  <dig> μm fe and at  <dig> μm fe, if we exclude g <dig>  the low iron andean bean. g <dig> a mesoamerican small black bean had surprisingly high levels of iron reductase activity under both conditions. g19277a, the other small black bean, had high iron reductase activity under iron-limited conditions but not under sufficiency conditions. g <dig>  the inter-genepool type, was intermediate.

among the wild genotypes, which were very much smaller seeded than any of either the mesoamerican or andean common beans, iron reductase activity was notably low in plants grown at  <dig> μm fe compared to the cultivated beans. one exception was g <dig>  which had high iron reductase activity comparable to the high seed iron andean bean genotypes. this genotype along with g <dig> also had high and moderate iron reductase activity in  <dig> μm fe grown plants, while the other wild beans had very low activity at both growth levels.

it was interesting that wild beans from both the andean and mesoamerican genepools behaved in a similar fashion at either level of iron, while the genotypes from the colombian wild genepool  were those that had high to intermediate iron reductase activity depending on the level of iron provided.

population distribution and qtl detection
in the experiment using the dor <dig> × g <dig> recombinant inbred lines, significant differences were found for iron reductase activity between the population distributions obtained with iron-limited  versus iron sufficient  plants, as shown in figure  <dig>  in this case,  <dig> μm fe was selected as the level of iron to test the population based on the best contrast between the parental genotypes in the initial parental screening experiment. the definite bimodal nature of the population distribution at  <dig> μm fe and the somewhat bimodal population distribution at  <dig> μm fe shows that inheritance of iron reductase activity was controlled by one or a few genes, respectively.

the range of iron reductase activity values obtained with iron-limited plants  was slightly broader than with iron sufficient plants . the averages at low and high iron growth concentrations were similar at  <dig>  and  <dig>  μmol fe reduced/g fw/hr, respectively. the position of the parental values relative to the lines showed there to be transgressive segregation at the higher iron concentration where dor <dig> and g <dig> were similar in iron reductase activity but the rils were much more widely distributed in their reductase activity. transgressive segregation was less evident at the lower iron concentration where dor <dig> was similar to one set of rils that had low iron reductase activity and g <dig> to the other set having high iron reductase activity in the bimodal distribution observed for  <dig> μm fe-grown plants.

qtl analysis using composite interval mapping confirmed that there was one major qtl under iron sufficiency  and this qtl was on a different chromosome from the one under iron-limited growth  as shown in figure  <dig>  therefore, it can be postulated that iron reductase activity was conditioned by more than one locus, with one iron reductase-related locus on chromosome b <dig> contributing to the trait in iron-limited plants and another iron reductase-related locus on chromosome b <dig> contributing to the trait in iron-sufficient plants. the qtl detected under iron-limited growth had a higher lod score  than the one under sufficiency  and correspondingly the r <dig> values were higher for the first qtl than the second . tr <dig> values were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, for the two qtl. alleles increasing iron reductase activity detected at both of these qtls were contributed by the parent g <dig>  to further understand the relationship of iron reductase and seed iron we compared the qtl for iron reductase activity and qtl for seed iron concentration from blair et al.  <cit> . an overlap of qtl controlling seed iron accumulation in the dor <dig> × g <dig> population with qtl for iron reductase activity was found on chromosome b <dig>  but not for the other iron reductase activity qtl on chromosome b <dig> 

genetic mapping and synteny analysis
our first goal in this section of our research was to develop a dna marker for a common bean iron reductase gene  based on est searches and cloning of orthologs of the iron reductase gene, while our second goal was to use in silico synteny mapping to discover iron reductase genes in the soybean genome and in equivalent common bean loci based on the comparative mapping described in galeano et al.  <cit> .

for our fro marker development, the first scar marker we used from p. sativum did not amplify as expected in common bean and was not used further. a second marker we developed based on an ssr in the nad-binding domain of a fro homologue produced a single band on polyacrylamide gels of  <dig> bp for dor <dig> and  <dig> bp for g <dig>  which was mapped to the middle of chromosome b <dig> within  <dig> cm of the flanking rflp markers bng <dig> and bng <dig>  the third primer pair tested based also on this region of the gene produced a single sized pcr product of  <dig> bp on agarose gels which when digested with hindiii showed a polymorphism between the parents  which was used to genetically map the marker to the middle of chromosome b <dig> at a distance of  <dig>  cm from the phaseolin gene.

for the synteny analysis, the fro sequence from common bean linked to chromosome b <dig>  was found to be homologous to pfam entries for fro <dig> and fro <dig> from a. thaliana, fro <dig> from m. truncatula and fro <dig> from p. sativum, the initial starting point for discovery of the fro orthologs in p. vulgaris. all the genes were found to have the ferric reductase domain toward the middle of the coding sequence followed by fad and nad binding domains at the 3' end of the gene. comparisons of these sequences to genomic sequences of soybean and medicago found that the gene model for the pvfro on chromosome b <dig> consisted of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns in both cases as seen in figure  <dig> where the position of the caps marker is also shown.

macro-synteny analysis based on galeano et al.  <cit>  for both legumes placed the fro gene in the middle of chromosome b <dig> of common bean exactly where the caps marker mapped. the homologous loci in the other legumes were 1) near the end of chromosome gm <dig> of soybean at  <dig> mb  or approximately  <dig> mb past the centromere with no homeologous position elsewhere in the soybean genome; and 2) at a locus  <dig> mb into chromosome  <dig> of medicago which being diploid was not expected to have a duplicate position. it was interesting that the position of introns was conserved with the 4th being the largest and interrupting part of the ferric reductase domain. several ests from common bean were found with homology to parts of the nad or fad domains but no other ests have been found covering the iron reductase domain.

discussion
for all the common bean genotypes investigated in this study, iron reductase activity was elevated in response to iron-limited growth conditions. this was especially evident with dor <dig>  g <dig>  and other genotypes, where at low iron concentrations  root iron reduction was  <dig>  times the activity under higher iron concentrations . this has been observed before in peas and other legumes, where low iron supply is known to induce increases in iron reductase activity  <cit> . in some genotypes such as dor <dig>  iron reductase activity at  <dig> μm fe might be reduced due to a need for iron in the enzyme itself. iron reductase activity is known to be the rate-limiting enzyme for iron uptake since iron transporters, which are the other important element of root iron acquisition, do not reach saturation at normally achieved concentrations of ferrous iron  <cit> . initial differences in the parents showed that dor <dig> and g <dig> had different sensitivities to growth on low iron concentration, with g <dig> having much higher iron reductase activity at  <dig> μm fe, the lower level selected for the ril study. apart from the intensively studied parental genotypes, wide variability was noted for iron reductase activity among the cultivated and wild common beans. among the cultivated beans, one notable conclusion was that high seed iron accumulators generally had higher iron reductase activity than low seed iron accumulators within each genepool, suggesting a link between root uptake and seed loading of iron in common bean contrasting with results with an iron reductase mutant in pea  <cit> . andean beans had higher iron reductase activity especially at low iron growth conditions and are generally higher for seed iron as well  <cit>  both of these results having implications for their use in biofortification or adaptation to low iron soils  <cit> .

while among the cultivated andean genepool there was high iron reductase activity under iron-limited growth, there was lower activity under sufficiency conditions, while the cultivars from the mesoamerican genepool had moderate to low activity under the two growth conditions. genotypes that accumulated high seed iron concentrations, such as g <dig> , g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> , generally had high iron reductase activity under iron-limited growth and moderate activity under iron sufficiency; in other words, they had higher and apparently more consistent iron reductase activity than those genotypes that did not accumulate high seed iron especially among mesoamerican genotypes. notably, one andean genotype, g <dig>  which was low in seed iron concentration, had very low iron reductase activity in iron limited and iron sufficient growth conditions. small-seeded black beans may have an adaptation to low iron soils in some cases as both g19277a and g <dig> were high in iron reductase activity under both growth conditions.

differences in seed iron levels and adaptation to low iron available soils have been found in common bean cultivars  <cit>  and may have been selected for during domestication and development of common bean races  <cit> . compared to pea, peanut and soybean, the only other legumes studied for this trait  <cit> , iron reductase activity responses were similar in roots of iron limited common beans and these results agree with those of bienfait et al.  <cit> . iron deficiency is a problem of high ph soils in certain bean temperate or dryland production regions but is not generally a problem in tropical countries with low ph soils.

wild beans which have never been studied before for this trait, appeared to be especially low in iron reductase activity, although one genotype was high in iron reduction. it is typical for greater variability to be present in wild beans compared to domesticated beans as a bottleneck in genetic diversity was suggested to have occurred at domestication  <cit>  and wild beans can be a source of high seed minerals  <cit> . natural selection on alkaline soils may have allowed the development of some populations of wild beans with high iron reductase activity and this may have been the case for the colombian wild bean g <dig> which has been analyzed for its diverse phenology compared to andean beans by blair et al.  <cit> .

the differences in iron reductase activity between parents allowed us to analyze the inheritance in the dor <dig> × g <dig> population. iron reductase activity under deficiency conditions appeared to be a monogenic trait controlled by a single qtl  mapping to chromosome b <dig>  meanwhile, the inheritance at iron sufficient conditions was slightly more complex, although a single qtl on chromosome b <dig>  was still the most determining factor for iron reductase activity. this qtl was very interesting because it aligned with qtl for seed iron accumulation from blair et al.  <cit> . although the correlation of icp seed iron accumulation with iron reductase activity in this study was not significant at either  <dig> μm  or at  <dig> μm , it was interesting to see that the iron reductase activity qtl was located in the same place as a seed iron concentration qtl for chromosome b <dig> 

the possibility of an association of iron reductase activity with more iron in the seed is of interest to biotechnologists  <cit> . this is the first study of iron reductase qtl as a component of iron homeostasis, although seed iron concentration has been measured in a range of qtl studies in arabidopsis  <cit> , common beans  <cit>  and other legumes  <cit> , just to mention those of interest here. mutant analysis has been of great utility for peas in the group of grusak and collaborators to study aspects of iron reductase activity  <cit> , iron transporters  <cit> , root changes during iron deficiency  <cit> , seed loading of iron  <cit>  and other aspects of iron homeostasis; results which suggest that mutagenesis may be an interesting method of dissecting iron uptake in common bean as well as suggested by blair et al.  <cit> .

surprisingly, neither of the qtl identified in this study for iron reductase activity aligned with the positions of the markers for pvfro orthologs that were successfully mapped on chromosomes b <dig> and b <dig>  this may have been expected, since in other research the control of iron reductase activity has been postulated to be under the control of a shoot to root signal that induces reductase expression  <cit> . it was not surprising that we found two map locations for the fro orthologs since iron reductases are known to be an eight-member gene family in arabidopsis thaliana, where paralogs exist and some genes have different functionality and expression patterns in roots versus several diverse above ground organs  <cit> . although the family has not been characterized in soybean we found one homologous copy of fro on chromosome gm <dig> with the equivalent positions in common bean being on chromosome b <dig> where the caps marker mapped to. medicago synteny confirmed this position.

given that the qtl for iron reductase activity do not map together with the loci for the fro genes, either as mapped markers or in synteny analysis, we may conclude that some other gene is controlling iron reductase activity. this could be due to another copy of the fro gene  <cit>  or an iron homeostasis regulator  <cit> . in the case of the qtl found under iron-limited growth, this may be equivalent to the dgl  or brz  loci in pea since both are involved in the constitutive up-regulation of iron reductase activity  <cit> . however, the state of synteny mapping between pea and other legumes make it difficult to know if the mutants or even the fro homologues are in equivalent positions between common bean and pea  <cit> .

from a physiological standpoint, any gene or signal stimulating iron reductase activity would be an important component needed to match root iron uptake with the above ground plant needs  <cit>  and might be a candidate for the qtl we identified. for example, the gene for such a signal could be related to ethylene induced local changes in root cell restructuring which affect iron reduction and transport  <cit> , to a shoot to root signal, or to a transcription factors affecting iron homeostasis. if this is the case, this signal may change in intensity throughout the life-cycle of the plant, such as during active seed-fill when iron is being loaded through the phloem to the developing seed  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in our germplasm survey, broad diversity for iron reductase activity was found in common bean with some differentiation of the andean and mesoamerican genepools and substantial differences between cultivated and wild beans. wild beans may not have the same requirement for iron uptake given their low seed yield and small leaves except for a few accessions from the colombian genepool, while some andean beans might have been selected for high iron reductase activity from being grown on higher ph/organic material soils which are low in iron concentration. mesoamerican beans would be less likely to have high iron reductase activity since they are generally grown on acid soils with plenty of iron. as was found for other legumes, iron limited conditions were seen to induce iron reductase activity, while at higher iron levels this activity was repressed. the genotypic differences in iron reductase activity between dor <dig> and g <dig> allowed the discovery of differentially expressed qtl at iron limited and iron sufficient growth conditions in the mapping population. these qtl  were independent and positioned on linkage groups b <dig> and b <dig>  respectively. the second of these qtl was associated with seed iron accumulation qtl but was not associated with the in silico or genetic map position of fro orthologs in common bean based on new markers and synteny mapping with soybean and medicago. the fro locus on linkage group b <dig> may have had an effect on seed iron accumulation but the mechanism would be unknown. meanwhile, the ira <dig>  qtl that clustered with seed iron qtl on b <dig> would be interesting for further dissection. all of these novel results represent achievements in the application of nutritional genomics to common bean biofortification.
