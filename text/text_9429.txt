BACKGROUND
high-throughput microarray technology is a powerful tool for genome-wide genotyping and gene expression analysis. microarray-based gene expression assessment is a very useful method for prediction of diseases, tumor classification and drug responses. although good quality rna can be extracted from fresh frozen  tissues, tissues preserved in rnalater reagent and primary cell culture, the limited availability of these sources is a problem with regards to the utility of gene expression measurements. as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  sample collection and storage are routine practices in pathological laboratories worldwide, there is great interest in the use of rna extracted from those archived samples.

integrity of nucleic acid is a very important issue for microarray analysis. it is well known that the ffpe tissue rna is often degraded and at the same time, it is chemically modified  <cit> . previous studies using different microarray platforms showed that only approximately 3% or less of the rna isolated from the ffpe tissue are useful for cdna synthesis, which is an important step for gene expression analysis on a microarray platform  <cit> . illumina inc. introduced a gene expression profiling method, dasl  specially designed for analysis of fragmented rna samples  <cit> . in the present study, we used the whole genome dasl assay on paired breast tumor and surrounding healthy tissue from both ffpe tissue and ff tissue to examine:  the feasibility of genome-wide gene expression analyses using dasl on ffpe tissue and  whether similar conclusions can be drawn by examining widely available ffpe tissue as a proxies for ff tissues.

methods
tissue samples
the study was approved by the institutional review board of the university of chicago. we obtained four different sets of tissue samples  from the same patients through our human tissue resource center  at the university of chicago http://pathcore.bsd.uchicago.edu/bsb/bsb_overview.shtml. htrc collected these breast tissues from mastectomy/lumpectomy specimens that were not needed for pathological diagnosis by the department of pathology at the university of chicago medical center. there were a total of  <dig> such patients for whom all  <dig> types of tissues were available. for the present study, tissue samples from the first  <dig> patients were used. these tissue samples were archived for a 3- <dig> year period.

rna extraction and quality control
for the extraction of total rna from both ffpe and ff breast tissue samples, we used the high pure rna paraffin kit . xylene was used for deparaffinization of the ffpe samples. proteinase k digestion was carried out by overnight incubation at 55°c. dnase treatment was carried out for all of the samples and samples were eluted with  <dig> μl of the elution buffer provided with the extraction kit. for quantification, each sample was  tested in a nanodrop  <dig> for concentration and 260/ <dig> ratio and also  run in an agilent bioanalyzer using the eukaryotic total rna nano series ii kit. prequalification of all the rna samples derive from ffpe and ff tissue was done by qpcr using sybr green detection. cdna was synthesized as recommended by illumina, and then a  <dig> bp amplicon was amplified from the highly expressed rpl13a ribosomal protein gene . the amplification reaction was carried out for all ffpe and ff samples in duplicates in abi prism  <dig> ht sequence detection systems . the Δct was calculated as ct  - ct . as per illumina protocol for dasl, a Δct of up to  <dig> was acceptable as prequalification for the assay. only  <dig> out of  <dig> breast tissue samples had Δct just above  <dig> and none >  <dig> . only  <dig> of these  <dig> samples showed a poor performance on the assay .

whole genome dasl assay
we used  <dig> ng of total rna  as starting material for each sample run on the microarray. each chip accommodates  <dig> samples. four types of sample for each patient were processed in one chip. the four types of sample were ff tumor tissue , ff adjacent normal tissue , ffpe tumor tissue  and  ffpe adjacent normal tissue . thus, a single chip contained  <dig> samples from  <dig> patients and three such chips  were processed in one batch. we also ran four technical replicates of the t_ffpe rna samples to analyze the reproducibility of the dasl assay. according to the manufacturer's protocol, rna was first converted to cdna through reverse transcription with biotinylated primers. the cdna was then annealed to the assay oligonucleotide and bound to streptavidin conjugated paramagnetic beads. after the oligohybridization, non-hybridized and miss-hybridized sequences were washed away and the hybridized sequences were extended and ligated to start pcr amplification with fluorescent tagged primers. the fluorescently labeled amplified pcr products were hybridized overnight onto the bead chip to be scanned on bead array reader.

statistical analyses and power
statistical analysis
to compare the continuous variables , we used one-way analysis of variance . for the gene expression data, we used quantile normalization in beadstudio software before exporting the data for partek genomic suite  <cit>  for further statistical analyses. principle components analysis  and sample histograms were checked as a part of quality control analyses of the data. mixed-model multi-way anova  was used to compare the individual gene expression data across different groups. in general, "disease status"  and "storage method"  were used as categorical variables with fixed effect since the levels tumor/normal or ffpe/ff represent all conditions of interest; whereas "case id#"  and "batch#" were treated as categorical variable with random effect, since the person or batch are only a random sample of all the levels of that factor. method of moments estimation was used to obtain estimates of variance components for mixed models  <cit> . as per study design we processed all four types of samples from one individual in a single chip , therefore batch# and case id# were linked, and thus they were not entered in the same model. in combined analysis when we included ffpe and ff samples together, the log2-transformed signal intensity was used as the response variable, and "tissue type " , "sample storage"  and case id# were entered as anova factors. in order to examine interaction between "tissue type" and "sample storage", we also entered the cross-product term "tissue type" × "sample storage" in the 3-way anova model. when we separately analyzed the ff and ffpe samples to identify differentially expressed genes in breast tumor compared to adjacent normal tissue, disease status or "tissue type", "batch#" and "block archival age" were entered as anova factors in the 3-way anova model. one example of a model  <cit>  that uses method of moments for combined analysis is as follows:

 yijkl=μ+tissuei+storagej+case idk+tissue*storageij+εijkl 

where yijkl represents the gene expression intensity of gene "y" in l-th sample with i-th tissue with j-th storage for the k-th case id; μ is the common effect for the whole experiment; and εijkl represents the random error, which is assumed to be normally and independently distributed with mean  <dig> and standard deviation δ for all measurements. case id is a random effect in this model.

similarly, when we analyzed the data separately for ff and ffpe samples to detect individual genes differentially expressed in tumor, we used the following 3-way anova model by using method of moments:

 yijkl=μ+tissuei+batch noj+block_agek+εijkl 

where yijkl represents the gene expression intensity of gene "y" in l-th sample with i-th tissue for the j-th batch no with k-th block_age. as in the model for combined analyses above, μ is the common effect for the whole experiment and εijkl represents the random error, which is assumed to be normally and independently distributed with mean  <dig> and standard deviation δ for all measurements. batch no is a random effect in this model.

in go enrichment analysis, we tested if the genes found to be differentially expressed fall into a gene ontology category more often than expected by chance. we used chi-square test to compare "number of significant genes from a given category/total number of significant genes" vs. "number of genes on chip in that category/total number of genes on the microarray chip". negative log of the p-value for this test was used as the enrichment score. therefore, a go group with a high enrichment score represents the lead functional group. the enrichment scores were analyzed in a hierarchical visualization and in tabular form.

in addition to looking at differential expression at individual gene level, we also examined the differential expression of gene sets using the gene set enrichment analysis   <cit> . given an a priori defined set of genes s , the goal of gsea was to determine whether the members of s were randomly distributed throughout the ranked list or primarily found at the top or bottom. considering the fact that gsea can look at single variable , we also used go-anova that offers adjustments for other factors like "person-to-person" variation, "tissue type" variation etc.

go-anova is a mixed model anova to test the expression of a set of genes  instead of an individual gene in different groups  <cit> . the analysis is performed at the gene level, but the result is expressed at the level of the go-category by averaging the member genes' results. the equation for the model was:

 model:y=μ+t+p+g+s+ε 

where y represents expression of a go-category, μ is the common effect or average expression of the go-category, t is tissue-to-tissue  effect, p is patient-to-patient effect, g is gene-to-gene effect , s is sample-to-sample effect  and ε represents the random error.

cross-validation: for the one-level cross validation, the data was first divided into  <dig> random partitions. at each iteration, 10% samples were held out for testing while the remaining 90% samples were used to fit the parameters of the model. we also used a  <dig> ×  <dig> two-level nested cross-validation  <cit> . in the outer cross-validation, with 10% of samples held out as test cases, the remaining 90% were used in a 10-fold cross-validation to determine the optimal predictor variables and other classifier parameters. the model that performed the best on the inner cross-validation was applied to the held-out test samples in the outer cross-validation. thus an inner cross-validation was performed in order to select predictor variables and optimal model parameters, and an outer cross-validation was used to produce overall accuracy estimates for the classifier. in the first step, we considered all the differentially expressed genes for inclusion in the model and then in the next step, for selecting the top  <dig> or  <dig> genes, expression of which could be used to differentiate the ffpe samples from the ff samples, we used 3-way anova . we tested three classification methods -  k-nearest neighbor  with euclidean distance measure and 1-neighbor,  nearest centroid with equal prior probability and  linear discriminent analysis with equal prior probability.

statistical power
in genome-wide gene expression experiments requiring multiple testing, it is more powerful and more reasonable to control false discovery rate  or positive fdr   <cit>  instead of type i error. we followed that strategy for sample size calculation. when controlling fdr, the traditional approach of estimating sample size by controlling type i error is no longer applicable  <cit> . in their paper, liu p and hwang jtg have compared calculations of sample size using four different approaches - all of which had good agreement and show that, for standardized effect size Δ/σ =  <dig> , if identification of 95% of the truly altered genes are desired , then the estimated sample size for each group would be between  <dig> and  <dig>  for standardized effect size Δ/σ =  <dig> , if identification of 95% of the truly altered genes is desired , then the estimated sample size for each group would be  <dig>  therefore, our study was sufficiently powered to detect a  <dig> -fold change difference in the combined analysis and a 2-fold change in the subgroup analysis where ff and ffpe samples were analyzed separately.

RESULTS
performance of the assay, evaluated by the number of detected genes per sample, was impressive. among the  <dig>  genes on the dasl assay, on average, about  <dig> genes  were detected in each sample at p <  <dig>  level. a gene was said to be detected at p <  <dig>  level if the mean signal intensity from multiple probes for that gene was significantly higher  than the negative control on the same chip. table  <dig> shows that the number of genes detected per sample at p <  <dig>  level per sample was comparable in all the four tissue types , suggesting uniform performance of dasl across ff and ffpe samples stratified by tissue type. the average signal intensity for all the genes and for the housekeeping genes are also shown in table  <dig> 

reproducibility
we ran  <dig> samples in duplicate  to check the reproducibility. a representative figure showing the correlation between log <dig> signal intensities is presented in figure 1a which shows r <dig> =  <dig> , suggesting acceptable reproducibility. the central line represents the regression line and the two lines on either side of the central line represent the boundary for 2-fold change.

correlations of log <dig> signal intensity between a pair of rna samples extracted from n_ff and n_ffpe tissue  and between t_ff & t_ffpe tissue  from same subject  are shown in figure 1b and figure 1c respectively. both the graphs show that in normal as well as in tumor tissue, a number of genes were found to be more than 2-fold up- or down-regulated in ffpe samples compared to corresponding ff samples. similarly, correlations between signal intensity from paired rna samples extracted from n_ff and corresponding t_ff tissue  and paired rna samples extracted from n_ffpe and t_ffpe tissue  from the same subject  are shown in figure 1d and figure 1e respectively. as expected, in both the ff and ffpe samples, there were a number of genes that were more than 2-fold up- or down-regulated in the tumor tissue compared to the corresponding normal tissue.

sources of variation in the gene expression
as part of the quality control of the data, we utilized principle component analysis  which indicated only one sample as an outlier. this sample had only  <dig> genes detected at p <  <dig>  level and also had a Δct =  <dig> . we excluded this sample from further analysis. pca on the remaining  <dig> breast tissue samples is shown in figure 2a, where the samples are color-coded by of sample storage type. the figure suggests a clustering effect of sample storage type. when we color-coded the samples by tissue type , we also saw a clustering effect of tissue type, but less prominent than for the type of sample storage.

in the next step, to further investigate the source of variation in the expression, we used multivariate anova. we did not use any filter for selecting the genes to be included in the analysis. in other words, anova was performed on log2-transformed intensity value for all the  <dig>  genes irrespective of their level of detection. the average f-ratio  for all the genes was considered as representative of significance of signal-to-noise ratio. figure 2b shows the significance of different sources of variation in the entire data in a model where tissue type , sample storage  and person-to-person variation  were entered as explanatory variables at a time for gene expression. the figure shows that "sample storage"  was the most significant source of variation, followed by the "disease status"  and person-to-person variation .

differential gene expression in ffpe samples compared to ff
in the total set of  <dig> breast samples, we looked at the genome-wide  differential gene expression in ffpe samples compared to ff samples after adjustment for tissue type , and inter-person variation. there were a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes  at fdr  <dig> . concerning fold change, a total of  <dig> genes had > 2-fold change in either direction . combining these two criteria, there were a total of  <dig> genes  that were differentially expressed by at least 2-fold at fdr  <dig>  level . for the statistically most significantly  differentially expressed gene, gigyf <dig>   <dig> % of the variation was due to "storage". taking all of these  <dig>  differentially expressed genes in ffpe samples into account, we found that overall  <dig> % of the variation in individual gene expression was contributed by "storage" ,  <dig> % by tissue type ,  <dig> % by "person-to-person" variation and the rest  <dig> % of the variation could not be explained by the anova model. it may be noted that among these  <dig>  genes, a total of  <dig> genes  were also differentially expressed  in tumor tissue compared to healthy tissue at fdr  <dig>  in our data set. in the breast cancer gene database   <cit> , there was a total of  <dig> genes of which  <dig> were studied in our gene-chip. we also looked if the expression of any of those  <dig> breast cancer related genes in bcgd list was also found to be affected by ffpe in our setting. in fact five of them  were in our list. we also separately tested the normal and tumor tissue data to see the effect of ffpe preservation. in the analysis of normal tissue only, a total of  <dig> genes in ffpe samples were differentially expressed  at least by 2-fold at fdr  <dig>  level, compared to corresponding ff samples. cluster analysis based on these genes could effectively separate the ffpe samples from the ff samples . in the analysis of tumor tissue only, a total of  <dig> genes in ffpe samples were differentially expressed  at least by 2-fold at fdr  <dig>  level, compared to corresponding ff samples. cluster analysis based on these genes also could effectively separate the tumor ffpe samples from the tumor ff samples . the venn diagram in figure 3b shows the overlap among these gene lists obtained from  combined analysis,  normal tissue alone and  tumor tissue alone to look for differentially expressed genes in ffpe tissue compared to corresponding ff tissue.

cross-validation
a  <dig> ×  <dig> two-level nested cross-validation analysis using all the  <dig>  differentially expressed genes in ffpe in present study suggested that the expression of these genes could differentiate ffpe samples from ff samples with overall accuracy of  <dig> %. the same  <dig> ×  <dig> two-level nested cross-validation analysis suggested that the expression of the top  <dig> genes could be used in a model that could differentiate ffpe samples from ff samples with overall accuracy of 100%. we also tested the top  <dig> genes, and again the overall accuracy was 100%. this further supported our anova finding that a number of genes are differentially expressed in ffpe samples compared to their corresponding ff sample.

differential expression profile at "gene set" level in ffpe samples compared to corresponding ff
in addition to individual gene level analysis, we also performed gsea to find out "gene sets" that are up- or down-regulated in ffpe. the top five "gene sets"  that were down-regulated in ffpe include: "nucleotide excision repair, dna gap filling" , "negative regulation of epithelial cell proliferation" , "chaperone binding", "dna polymerase activity" and "dna-directed dna polymerase activity". the up-regulated go-category includes: "positive regulation of gene-specific transcription" , "regulation of rho protein signal transduction", "rho guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity", "dopamine receptor signaling pathway", and "thymic t cell selection". go-anova also confirmed these findings. figure  <dig> shows one of the examples: the genes in go-category "negative regulation of epithelial cell proliferation"  were overall down-regulated in ffpe.

considering the effect of ffpe on the gene expression, we then looked at the differential gene expression in tumor tissue compared to adjacent normal tissue in two ways -  looking at the combined data  with adjustment for "sample storage" and "person to person variation" and  looking at the ff and ffpe data separately with paired comparisons to detect differential expression in tumor and to see if similar conclusion could be made.

differential gene expression in breast tumor tissue compared to corresponding adjacent normal breast tissue
among the  <dig> individuals included in the analyses of breast tissues, one had fibroadenoma,  <dig> had no abnormality detected and in one the histopathology was unknown. therefore, to get a clearer picture of genes differentially expressed in breast cancer, we included  <dig> samples from  <dig> patients with known histopathological diagnosis of breast cancer . of these  <dig> samples, one ff tumor sample was excluded due to poor performance on the chip . the analysis was restricted to the  <dig> arrays. in addition to pca, we also used unsupervised hierchical clustering based on all  <dig>  genes which showed clustering by sample storage  as well as by histopathology .

in this total set of  <dig> samples, we looked at the genome-wide  differential gene expression in breast tumor tissue compared to adjacent normal tissue after adjustment for "sample storage" , and "person to person variation" . there were a total of  <dig> genes  that were differentially expressed at least by 2-fold at fdr  <dig>  level.

in the next step, we analyzed the data separately for ff and ffpe samples to evaluate the significance of "batch effect" and "sample block age" as sources of variation in the overall gene expression data. the f-ratio for these factors in these two types of sample storage methods are shown in figure 5a and figure 5b, respectively. the data shows that both the "batch effect" and "block age" contributed more significantly as the source of variation in overall expression data in the ffpe samples. however, by study design we assayed the paired samples on the same chip to minimize batch-effect. in paired analysis of the ff samples , a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in breast tumor tissue by at least 2-fold at fdr  <dig>  level . on the other hand, using the same criteria in ffpe samples, a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in breast tumor .

how do these gene lists compare to breast cancer or multiple cancer signatures from prior studies
ein-dor et al  <cit>  correctly described earlier that several microarray studies yielded gene sets whose expression profile successfully predicted survival, but the overlap between these gene sets was very low. we compared our three gene lists  with some of the published data related to prognosis/survival  <cit>  in breast and/or other cancer and two commercially available gene sets for real-time pcr assays from sa bioscience http://www.sabiosciences.com/arraylist.php. it was not surprising to see different degree of overlap . however it was interesting to see the predictive accuracy of those different gene lists from different studies or sources in our data set. for example, although only  <dig> out of  <dig> genes in bcgd list  <cit>  was common with our  <dig> genes, expression pattern of those  <dig> genes could correctly identify  <dig> out of  <dig> samples included in our study . on the other hand,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes of the martin kj et al  <cit>  list  overlapped with our list from combined analysis; however prediction based on expression of those  <dig> genes in our data set was just slightly higher at  <dig> %.

*all the genes in the external list were used in a model to predict the tissue type  in our data set to calculate the % correct rate. for all models, nearest centroid with equal prior probability was used as classification method. ** gene lists are combined from su et al  <cit> , yu et al  <cit>  and ramaswami et al. <cit> 

go enrichment analyses of the lists of differentially expressed genes in breast cancer tissue compared to normal breast tissue in ff and ffpe samples
the go-enrichment analysis tests if the genes found to be differentially expressed  in a given list fall into a gene ontology category more often than expected by chance. enrichment score was calculated as the negative log of the p-value of the test statistics. hence, higher enrichment scores represent lead functional go-groups. the functional groupings are sometimes easier to understand than pathways. the scores are used to rank the functional groupings. in go, the genes are categorized into different go-terms in three ways:  by "biological process",  by "molecular function" and  by "cellular components". first, we used go-enrichment analysis for the two lists of up-regulated genes in breast tumor derived from analysis of ff and ffpe samples. figure  <dig> and figure  <dig> show hierarchical clustering of the enrichment scores for the "cellular process" category under the broad term "biological process" for ff and ffpe samples respectively. it may be noted that in both the lists derived from ff and ffpe samples, the go-term "cell division" and "cell cycle" were the top-ranking lead groups. this is very much biologically relevant with respect to any carcinogenesis in general. in fact, enrichment scores of "cell division" and "cell cycle" related genes constituted  <dig> % of the total score for the "cellular process" for the up-regulated genes found in ff samples and  <dig> % of the up-regulated genes found in ffpe sample. similarly, we looked at the go-enrichment analysis for the down-regulated gene lists in tumor derived from ff and ffpe samples  and figure  <dig> respectively for "biological process" categorization). the top-ranking functional lead groups show similarity between the gene lists derived from ff and ffpe samples. similarly, under the broad category "cellular components", the go-term "extracellular region" comes up in both ff as well as ffpe samples , emphasizing the significance of alteration in the extra-cellular matrix in breast carcinogenesis.

therefore our findings suggest that the analysis of ffpe samples does not identify the exact same genes that would have been identified by analyzing ff samples, but at least, the list shows some similarity in terms of enrichment of go-terms representing the lead functional groups of genes. in other words, ffpe samples may not be ideal for picking individual target gene, but may be used to identify the lead functional group of genes that are differentially expressed in tumor.

for the up-regulated genes in breast tumor, that we found by analyzing the ff samples , if we looked at the enrichment of go-terms under all the three major groups together - "biological process", "molecular function" and "cellular components", the top most ranking go-term was "nucleosome" under "cellular components". all the up-regulated genes under this go-term are from the same family of genes that are related to hist <dig> and hist <dig> proteins.

for the down-regulated genes in breast tumor, that we found by analyzing the ff samples, if we look at the enrichment of go-terms under all the three major groups - "biological process", "molecular function" and "cellular components", the top ranking go-term was "regulation of epithelial cell proliferation" under the "biological process". this finding is also very much relevant in the context of breast cancer pathogenesis. these down-regulated genes include fgf <dig>  fgf <dig>  apc, igf <dig>  cdkn2b, notch <dig>  lamc <dig>  lamb <dig>  nkx3- <dig>  tbx <dig>  and gas <dig> 

we performed go-enrichment analysis of the  <dig> genes common in all the three anova analyses -  ff samples,  ffpe samples and in  combined analysis. subsequent hierarchical clustering suggested that a number of those genes  were significantly associated with breast cancer that appeared repeatedly in different go-terms. for example, pparg was significant in the go-terms "anatomical structure development", "organ development", "developmental maturation", "lipid metabolism", "regulation of biological quality", "transcription factor activity", "molecular transducer activity", "drug binding", and "lipid binding". the dot plot in figure  <dig> shows the expression of pparg and fgf <dig> in paired samples  preserved as ff as well as ffpe sections. pparg is shown to be down-regulated in breast cancer in all the patients and fgf <dig> is shown to be down-regulated in breast cancer in all but one patient in both ff and ffpe sections.

interaction between "tissue type" and "sample storage"
in mixed model anova, we also entered the interaction term "tissue type  × sample storage " to identify the genes that show a different degree, or even direction, in differential expression in tumor compared to normal tissue for ff or ffpe samples. there were a total of  <dig> genes that showed significant interaction at fdr  <dig> ; of which  <dig> also had differential expression in tumor at fdr  <dig>  with at least  <dig> -fold change . the present study suggests that differential expression of these genes in tumor should be cautiously interpreted if ffpe samples are studied. figure  <dig> shows differential expression of a gene  without any significant interaction. expression of the lpl gene was down-regulated in tumor tissue compared to adjacent normal tissue in an identical fashion in both ff as well as ffpe samples. on the other hand, figure  <dig> shows the examples of the genes which show significant interaction, i.e. degree of differential expression in tumor , is significantly influenced by the storage. for example, if we look at the expression of znf <dig> gene  in ff tissue, we would notice significant down-regulation in tumor, but if we look at ffpe samples, there was no differential expression in tumor.

expression of known "clinically relevant" genes in our data
from a therapeutic point of view, determination of her <dig>  estrogen receptor  and progesterone receptor  gene expressions is very helpful in decision-making for therapeutic regimens  <cit> . we therefore looked at these genes in particular in our data set . expression of the esr <dig> gene  was significantly affected by ffpe storage. expression of the esr <dig> and pgr genes were very minimally affected by storage, and that of her <dig> was not affected at all. we found her <dig> to be up-regulated by  <dig>  fold  and pgr to be down-regulated by  <dig>  fold  in tumor compared to adjacent normal tissue.

do we see same "gene sets" to be differentially expressed in breast tumor tissue compared to corresponding adjacent normal breast tissue in ff and ffpe samples?
after looking into the differential expression at individual gene level, we also looked for differential expression of different "gene sets" in breast cancer tissue by using the gene set enrichment analysis  as well as go-anova. gsea of the ff samples showed that a total of  <dig> "gene sets"  were differentially expressed  in breast cancer tissue compared to adjacent healthy tissue. on the other hand, gsea of the ffpe samples showed a total of  <dig> "gene sets" were differentially expressed at p-value = <  <dig>  in breast cancer ffpe tissue compared to adjacent healthy ffpe tissue. only  <dig> "gene sets"  were common in both the analyses. therefore, gsea also suggested the need for caution for interpretation of gene expression data from ffpe samples.

go-anova of the ff samples showed that a total of  <dig> "gene sets"  were differentially expressed at fdr  <dig>  in breast cancer tissue compared to adjacent healthy tissue. on the other hand, go-anova of the ffpe samples showed that  <dig>  "gene sets" were differentially expressed at fdr = <  <dig>  in breast cancer ffpe tissue compared to adjacent healthy ffpe tissue. a total of  <dig> "gene sets"  were common in both the analyses. this result also suggested the need for caution for interpretation of gene expression data from ffpe samples.

the overlaps of these results from gsea and go-anova in ff and ffpe samples are presented in figure  <dig>  in general, go-anova could detect larger number of differentially expressed gene sets , however it may be noted that most of the gene sets detected by gsea were also detected by go-anova -  <dig> % in ff and  <dig> % in ffpe samples. there was a total of  <dig> "gene sets" that was common to all four analyses. those  <dig> gene sets are shown in table  <dig>  it may be noted that genes related to "transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway" were down-regulated  and genes related to "nucleosome" were up-regulated  in breast cancer. it may be noted that go-enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed gene lists also showed highest enrichment score for genes related to "nucleosome".

discussion
gene expression profiling of human cancer has proved valuable in cancer research leading not only to the identification of targets but also contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms of the process  <cit> . the application of microarrays is limited by the availability of fresh frozen tissue or the tissue preserved in rnalater reagent. as ffpe samples are available in almost all the pathological laboratories and are often available in conjunction with clinical and follow-up data, they would be considered as the most valuable sources for microarray analysis  <cit> , provided similar information can be obtained as would be expected from analyzing the ff samples. because of fragmentation  <cit>  and some other chemical modifications of rna in ffpe samples, currently gene expression studies are largely limited to immuno-histochemical  staining and rt-pcr, which allow only a few genes to be amplified at a time  <cit> . in this paper we mainly focus on the use of ffpe samples in genome-wide gene expression experiments. we have tried to analyze the data for differential expression from different angles - at individual gene level, at "gene set" level and also used different statistical methods. in follow-up paper we would focus more on gene selection and relevance to breast cancer biology.

like other investigators  <cit> , we also observed high reproducibility across technical replicates regardless of the sample type. however, the concordance between the paired ff and ffpe samples was weaker in our study, which is also consistent with other studies  <cit> . the tissue archival age, or the "ffpe block age" is another factor for consideration. cronin et al. compared frozen section breast tissue with ffpe samples of "various block ages" by rt pcr for  <dig> genes and found a 90% signal loss in ffpe samples  <cit> . our data on the genome-wide level also suggested the significance of ffpe "block age" on gene expression data. srinivasan et al.  <cit> , and karsten et al  <cit>  and masuda et. al  <cit>  have reviewed in detail the effect of fixative and tissue processing on the content and integrity of nucleic acids. there are four types of reactions of formaldehyde with nucleic acids:  addition reaction or methylolation - the n-h groups of primarily adenine and thiamine are converted to n-ch2-oh groups . the poly tail on rna is thus heavily methylolated leading to poor reverse transcription. this methylolation is possibly reversible through hydrolysis.  cross-linking - methylolated bases can react with n-h groups  to form -n-ch2_n- cross-links, which are not easily hydrolyzed.  formation of apyrimidinic/apurinic sites - the n-glycosidic bond between a, c, g, t or u and the sugar backbone is broken, leaving a blank space in the sequence. this is not base-specific, but is not reversible.  fragmentation - formaldehyde catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds, fragmenting strands of nucleic acids, which is also not reversible. therefore, it was not a surprise to find differential gene expression in ffpe samples compared to ff samples in the present study.

bibikova et al. used a smaller panel of the dasl assay with  <dig> pairs of ff and ffpe samples from healthy and tumor breast tissue and healthy and colon cancer tissue  <cit> . they found that ffpe samples had 50% less gene expression compared to matched ff samples, which may be due to rna degradation related to fixation and storage  <cit> . the present study is one of the first few adequately powered, whole-genome dasl assays interrogating more than  <dig>  genes that has compared the results of paired tumor and normal tissue from ff and ffpe samples.

our findings suggest that the analysis of ffpe samples does not identify the exact same genes that would have been identified by analyzing ff samples, but at least, the list shows some similarity in terms of enrichment of go-terms representing the lead functional groups of genes. in other words, ffpe samples may not be ideal for picking individual target gene, but may be used to identify the lead functional group of genes that are differentially expressed in tumor. findings of the differentially expressed genes in breast cancer were biologically meaningful. on the one hand the "cell cycle" & "cell division" related genes were up-regulated and on the other hand, genes related to "regulation of epithelial cell proliferation" were down-regulated. genes involved in metalloexopeptidase activity, transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway, bmp signaling pathway, were found to be down-regulated in breast cancer.

as mentioned in the results section, some of the genes  were found repeatedly in the lists of different go-terms. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ , is expressed in a large number of human cancers, including breast, colon, stomach, prostate, pancreas, bladder, placenta, lung, chondrosarcoma and in leukemia  <cit> . recently jiang et al. showed that pparg expression in immunohistochemistry was positively correlated to estrogen receptor status, inversely associated with histological grade and tumor size, and in survival analysis patients with higher pparg expression had significantly better prognosis  <cit> . in the same direction, the present study showed evidence of down-regulation of pparg in breast cancer tissue. gwas using germ line dna showed a significant association of snp in the fgfr <dig> gene with breast cancer  <cit> . in the same line, in the present study, we also found fgf <dig> to be down-regulated in breast cancer. another biologically relevant gene that we found to be differentially expressed in breast cancer was corticotropin releasing hormone binding protein . corticotropin-releasing hormone is a potent stimulator of synthesis and secretion of preopiomelanocortin-derived peptides. although crh concentrations in the human peripheral circulation are normally low, they increase throughout pregnancy and fall rapidly after parturition. maternal plasma crh probably originates from the placenta. human plasma contains a crh-binding protein that inactivates crh and may prevent inappropriate pituitary-adrenal stimulation in pregnancy.

an apparent weakness of the present study is the lack of gene expression data from breast tissue preserved in rna stabilization buffer, which would have served as the gold standard against which ffpe samples could have been compared. however, 72% of the genes that we found to be differentially expressed in ffpe breast tissue compared to corresponding ff in present study were also differentially expressed in ffpe skin tissue compared to the "gold standard"- rnalater preserved corresponding skin tissue sample . one of the strengths of the present study is that it was adequately powered to detect differential expression arising from tissue storage  or disease status .

CONCLUSIONS
in agreement with other studies using the dasl platform, our present study also suggests the usefulness of dasl chemistry to study gene expression in fragmented rna samples. dasl can efficiently handle the fragmentation issue of rna in ffpe samples. however, formalin fixation used in ffpe induces significant gene expression change in a number of genes, and these changes may differ in degree or even in direction between tumor and normal tissue. therefore, ffpe samples should not be directly compared with ff samples and considerable caution must be taken when interpreting gene expression data from ffpe samples. despite these constraints, we found a number of biologically meaningful, differentially expressed genes related to hist <dig>  hist <dig> proteins, and some other such as pparg, fgf <dig>  apob, crhbp, cetp, and rxrg in breast cancer tissue compared to corresponding adjacent normal breast tissue. the validity of these specific observations, however, needs to be confirmed in future larger studies.
