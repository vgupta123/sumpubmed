BACKGROUND
the nme family, initially called nucleoside diphosphate kinases  or nm <dig>  are evolutionarily conserved proteins present in all three domains of life: bacteria, archaea and eukarya  <cit> . vertebrate nme enzymes can be separated into two evolutionarily distinct groups. in humans, group i includes nme1-nme <dig> and group ii includes nme5-nme <dig> proteins. nme <dig>  also known as xrp <dig>  was the last described member and apparently has a somewhat different evolutionary history to group i or group ii genes; it is characterized by a recent insertion of a partial ndpk domain  <cit> . the human nme <dig> was recognized as the first metastasis suppressor and is the most studied member of the nme family of proteins  <cit> . in contrast to tumor suppressor genes, metastasis suppressor genes do not abolish or diminish the tumorigenicity of a tumor, they only affect its potential to metastasise. this means that a metastasis suppressor fulfills its biological function within the processes linked to the metastatic cascade: tumor cell dissociation, invasion of the surrounding tissue, journey through the blood circulation, invasion and secondary tumor growth at a distinct site in the body  <cit> . in addition to melanoma  <cit> , the metastasis suppressor activity of nme <dig> has been detected in breast  <cit> , cervical  <cit> , hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> , and several other neoplastic lesions  <cit> . the nme1/ndpk a and nme2/ndpk b protein products represent two subunits of a well known, house-keeping enzyme - nucleoside-diphosphate kinase . these subunits can assemble into the enzymatically active hexamer in all possible combinations   <cit> . ndpk is involved in the maintenance of the cellular ntp pool, transferring the phosphate group through the histidine phosphointermedier. interestingly, it seems that this biochemical feature of ndpk is not responsible for its antimetastatic activity  <cit> . subsequently, several other biochemical functions have been assigned to this protein: histidine kinase activity  <cit> , 3'-5' exonuclease and dna cleavage activity  <cit> , and transcriptional regulatory activity  <cit> . the nme family is known to participate in numerous crucial biological events such as proliferation  <cit> , differentiation  <cit> , development  <cit>  and apoptosis  <cit> , as well as in adhesion, migration  <cit> , and vesicular trafficking  <cit> . in spite of the comprehensive scientific activity in this area it is still unclear which biochemical/biological activities are responsible for nme's antimetastatic role.

a recent evolutionary study on all known vertebrate nmes showed that nme <dig> and nme <dig> arose by cis-duplication  <cit> . nme <dig> and nme <dig> proteins are 88% identical in amino-acid sequences and their genes are located next to each other. although very similar in primary structure, nme <dig> and nme <dig> are well distinguished by their distinct pi value:  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. cis-duplication and the appearance of nme <dig> probably occurred in a common ancestor of amniotes  <cit> . however, bilitou et al.  <cit>  observed two nmegp <dig> sequences in the cnidarian nematostella vectensis also located next to each other, and desvignes et al.  <cit>  found independent duplications of nmegp <dig> genes in several opisthokont lineages.

sponges  are the simplest metazoan phylum and branched off first from the common ancestor of all animals  <cit> , however, see also  <cit>  for an alternative view. they have changed little during evolution and can provide insight into the metazoan ancestor's genomic features  <cit> . the genome of the marine sponge suberites domuncula encodes at least two nme proteins. one belongs to group i and displays a high similarity to its human nme <dig> homolog , therefore it was named nm23-sd <dig> when it was first described  <cit> . in accordance with the new nomenclature, this protein is now renamed to nmegp1sd. the other protein, nme6sd  is most similar to human group ii member nme <dig> protein   <cit> . the total number of nme proteins in s. domuncula is possibly greater than two because the est database used in the s. domuncula nme study  <cit>  contained at most  <dig> non-redundant cdna sequences which is certainly far less than the total number of genes in the s. domuncula genome. orthologues of human nme <dig>  nme <dig> and nme <dig> appeared very early in animal evolution and are present in basal metazoans - cnidarian n. vectensis and placozoan t. adhaerens as well as in choanoflagelate m. brevicollis genomes. group i nme diversified much later, after the appearance of chordates  <cit> . therefore, we expect that most of the nme enzymes in sponges are probably members of group ii.

although the sponge s. domuncula nmegp1sd protein displays high similarity with vertebrate nme <dig>  the most recent group i member, it may reflect characteristics of the protein ancestral to group i, before the later duplications and diversifications that have occurred within this group. our goal was to determine the gene structure and study the biochemical characteristics and functions of the s. domuncula protein nmegp1sd. furthermore, we wanted to test whether it can substitute for the most recent  group i member human nme <dig>  and show a similar ability to suppress migration and, therefore, possibly even the metastatic potential of human cancer cells in vitro.

RESULTS
structure and evolution of sponge group i nme gene
group i nme genes were analyzed in two sponges: amphimedon queenslandica and suberites domuncula. only one gene coding for group i nme enzyme was found in the genome of the sponge a. queenslandica. a search of the corresponding est database revealed the presence of two cdna types with 5'untranslated regions   <dig> bp and  <dig> bp long, and therefore the existence of two transcription initiation sites. the 5'utr region of nmegp1sd is  <dig> bp long and the transcription start site is located after oligopyrimidine tract. in a. queenslandica the tata box-like motif  was identified in a region - <dig> to - <dig> nucleotides upstream from the transcriptional start of the shorter est. in s. domuncula the nmegp1sd gene tata box like motif  was found spanning from - <dig> to - <dig> nucleotides. the human nme <dig> gene has no tata box. it contains a number of motifs which may bind known transcriptional regulatory proteins such as ap- <dig>  ctf/nf <dig>  acaaag, and ets  <cit> . an ets binding sequence was found spanning from - <dig> to - <dig> nucleotides  in the promoter region of the nmegp <dig> gene from sponge a. queenslandica and from - <dig> to - <dig> nucleotides  in the promoter region of the nmegp1sd gene from sponge s. domuncula. chen et al.  <cit>  showed that the presence of a motif typical for ap- <dig> transcriptional elements in the 5' region of the human nme <dig> gene is essential for promoter activity. a putative site for ap- <dig> in the a. queenslandica nmegp <dig> 5' flanking region was found spanning from - <dig> to - <dig> nucleotides  and in s. domuncula nmegp <dig> from - <dig> to - <dig> nucleotides . the structure of sponge nmegp <dig> promoter regions is shown in additional file  <dig> 

the nme gene from a. queenslandica is  <dig> bp long from the atg start codon to the tag stop codon. it has four short introns with lengths of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively. the nmegp1sd gene from s. domuncula coding region and introns encompasses  <dig> bp from the atg start codon to the taa stop codon and contains three introns . their positions and phases are shown in figure  <dig>  multiple sequence alignment of nmegp1sd gene homologs was produced and used to compare intron positions. the results are shown in figure  <dig>  nmegp1sd gene lacks the fourth intron which is present in the homolog from a. queenslandica.

as mentioned before, two nmegp <dig> genes in the cnidarian n. vectensis were found. like nme <dig> and nme <dig> in mammals and lizard, these two genes are located next to each other. therefore, we checked neighboring genes in the genome of a. queenslandica and found that the nmegp <dig> gene is surrounded by unc <dig> and acad <dig> genes and not by another nme homolog. extensive searches of the a. queenslandica genome  <cit>  and s. domuncula cdnas  <cit>  revealed only one nmegp <dig> gene in each of these two demosponges. independent duplications have also been identified in branchiostoma floridae and ciona intestinalis  <cit>  as well as more recently in other opisthokonts  <cit> . searches of ncbi's dbest revealed the presence of cdnas that encode two nmegp <dig> proteins in the calcareous sponges sycon raphanus  and leucetta chagosensis . phylogenetic analysis shows that distinct sponge proteins from the same species clearly group together, indicative of independent duplications . the cnidarian hydra magnipapillata also has at least two group i member genes which are not located next to each other in the genome. demosponge proteins cluster in a poorly supported and poorly resolved branch together with cnidarian, placozoan, s. purpuratus and b. floridae homologs while calcarean proteins form a separate branch.

the sponge nmegp1sd protein forms a hexamer
various oligomeric structures such as hexamers, tetramers, dimers, and monomers were found after cross-linking the nmegp1sd protein with glutaraldehyde. recombinant nmegp1sd appears to be predominantly in the hexameric form . a similar oligomeric pattern was observed with the recombinant human nme <dig> protein. the hexameric form was expected due to the conservation of the kpn loop . each kpn loop interacts with two others with helices α <dig> and α <dig>  and with the four terminal residues  <cit> , well preserved in the sponge nmegp1sd . residues lys  <dig>  pro  <dig>  <cit>  and ser  <dig>  <cit>  known to be crucial for hexamer formation are also conserved in the sponge nmegp1sd . thus, we can conclude that all the residues necessary for the hexameric structure are present in the sponge nmegp1sd enzyme, and known residues that could impede this structure are absent. the hexameric structure of sponge nmegp1sd was also confirmed by gel filtration . previously described human nme <dig>  <cit>  was used as marker. overlapping gel filtration peaks confirm our finding that both proteins have a similar molecular weight as well as hexameric structure.

the sponge nmegp1sd protein has a similar level of kinase activity as the human nme <dig> but shows nonspecific dna-binding activity
the specific kinase activities of the sponge nmegp1sd and human nme <dig> enzymes were measured in parallel and found to be  <dig> u/mg and  <dig> u/mg, respectively. in comparison, ma et al.  <cit>  found the kinase activity of nme <dig> protein to be  <dig> u/mg while bago et al.  <cit>  observed  <dig> u/mg. the specific activities of the sponge nmegp1sd enzyme and human nme <dig> kinase were similar and within the previously reported ranges for the human protein.

purified nmegp1sd protein is able to bind non-specifically to single-stranded circular dna  . binding activity was observed with concentration of  <dig>  μm, manifested by increase in dna band retardation. the majority of the protein-dna complexes at concentrations of nmegp1sd > <dig>  μm exist in the form of big aggregates which stack in the wells . human nme <dig> did not display an ability to bind sscdna, while human nme <dig> binds sscdna and shows the same dna band retardation effect as sponge nmegp1sd. however, higher concentration  of human nme <dig> protein was needed to form the same amount of aggregates .

the sponge nmegp1sd does not cleave negatively supercoiled dna
nme <dig> is involved in dna structural changes necessary for the activity of the c-myc promoter. it binds to the nhe sequence of the c-myc promoter cloned into puc <dig> which yields mostly open circle  plasmid  <cit> . we have considered the possibility that the sponge nmegp1sd may already have dna topoisomerase-like activity similar to the human nme <dig>  to test this activity, nmegp1sd protein was incubated with supercoiled puc <dig> plasmid containing the 57-bp c-myc nhe sequence. we used topoisomerase i, nme <dig> and nme <dig> proteins as controls. control topoisomerase i and human nme <dig> cleaved negatively supercoiled plasmid dna unlike nmegp1sd and human nme <dig> which did not display this activity .

the human cell recognizes the sponge nme as its own
the objective of testing the localization and function of sponge nmegp1sd in well established human in vitro systems was to reveal whether the sponge nmegp1sd can be recognized as the domestic protein in the human cell and whether it can replace its human homolog. to compare the subcellular localization of human nme <dig> and nmegp1sd in hep- <dig> cells we transiently transfected the cells with pegfpn1-nme <dig> and pdsredn1-nmegp1sd. we analyzed the cells  <dig> hours post transfection using confocal laser scanning microscopy . the localization of nme1-gfp was mainly the same as in a previous study  <cit>  in which nme <dig> was fused to the c-terminus of gfp . the signal is mainly present in the cytoplasm, has a punctiform structure with occasional bigger highly fluorescent "granum-like" structures present in the cytoplasm, often, but not exclusively, located adjacent to the nucleus. nme <dig> can also very clearly be seen in a portion of the nuclei. the nmegp1sd-dsred reveals the same localization pattern which could be seen in separate figures and merged with human nme <dig> . to confirm the nmegp1sd nuclear localization we performed additional experiments and transfected hep- <dig> cells with pegfpn1-nmegp1sd since the gfp has a brighter fluorescence than the dsred and is, therefore, easier to analyze. these experiments confirmed the occasional presence of nmegp1sd in the nucleus. the fluorescent nmegp1sd also seems to form "granum-like" structures and they colocalize with the ones formed by human nme <dig>  these experiments show that the human and the sponge nme colocalize - adopt the same distribution in all transfected hep- <dig> cells analyzed, at any time-point. these experiments encouraged us to further analyse the interaction of human nme <dig> and nmegp1sd in human cells.

in western blot analysis a few cal  <dig> clones expressing nmegp1sd were identified, and two of them  were chosen for further analysis . to test the possible interactions of sponge and human nme proteins we used the previously produced nme <dig> overexpressing cal  <dig> clones k <dig> and k <dig>  <cit> . to test if sponge flag/nmegp1sd forms complexes with endogenous human nme <dig>  flag was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of flag/nme <dig> overexpressing clones , and flag/nmegp1sd expressing clones  with anti-flag m <dig> affinity gel. the results of the western blot analysis with anti-nme <dig> or anti-nme <dig> and anti-flag antibody reveal that flag/nmegp1sd forms complexes with the endogenous nme <dig> . therefore, we have proved that the human nme <dig> recognizes the sponge variant as a partner. the final confirmation of our theory that the human cell recognizes the sponge protein as its own comes from tests in boyden chambers. the intention of this experiment was to test the migration potential of cal  <dig> cells stably expressing sponge nmegp1sd, and compare it with the human nme <dig> overexpressing cells that show diminished migratory potential compared to control, cal  <dig> cells. figure  <dig> shows that nmegp1sd expressing clones,  have substantially diminished migratory potential. therefore, nmegp1sd suppresses motility of cal  <dig> cells. the same result was observed in three independent experiments.

discussion
the objective of this study was primarily to determine the structure and biochemical characteristics of the nmegp1sd in order to gain a deeper insight into the evolution of metazoan nme proteins and their functions.

sponge group i nme genes are intron-rich and these introns are relatively short. the same has been found for introns in several other sponge genes  <cit>  and recently in a. queenslandica genome where median intron size is  <dig> bp  <cit> . the fourth intron  is likely the most ancient because it is also found in a choanoflagellate group i nme homolog. we conclude that the ancestral metazoan group i nme gene was intron-rich and probably had all four introns that are still present in most extant basal metazoan homologs. the ancestral gene structure is also well preserved in vertebrate homologs with three out of four introns present. d. melanogaster has only one of the ancestral introns and c. elegans lost all ancestral introns and gained two new ones which likely reflect accelerated evolution in these lineages. analysis of sponge nmegp <dig> promoters showed that some of the motifs essential for human promoter activity are also present in sponges. we did not find these motifs in the corresponding choanoflagellate promoter under the same search parameters, which indicates a possible change in nme <dig> regulation in the metazoan lineage.

the phylogenetic tree  is generally not well resolved or supported, as in comparable earlier studies  <cit> . nonetheless, it does provide some new evidence on group i nme evolution. group i nme gene duplicates in n. vectensis had been proposed to indicate that the split into nme <dig> and nme <dig> might have occurred very early in metazoan evolution  <cit> . another recent study  <cit>  showed that duplications of group i nme genes occurred independently more than once in invertebrates, besides well described duplications and diversifications of group i nme to nme <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in vertebrate lineage, and that duplication in n. vectensis is also an independent event unrelated to the origin of nme <dig> and nme <dig>  our results confirm these findings and additionally demonstrate independent duplications in basal metazoans, even within the same lineages .

the metastasis suppressor genes nme are highly conserved in opisthokonts. this implies that they have important roles in basic cellular functions. a number of studies revealed several potential biological roles of nme genes/proteins, but most are not confirmed in vivo. the expression of the d. discoideum nme homologues gip <dig> and guk <dig>  is modulated during the developmental phases of cell growth or aggregation due to starvation  <cit> . in drosophila, nme/awd is required for the proper differentiation of many tissues including the brain, eye, and female reproductive system  <cit> . nme protein accumulation is coincident with the functional differentiation of multiple epithelial tissues in the developing mouse  <cit> . these and many other studies demonstrate that nme proteins have a critical role in differentiation and development - processes that involve cell migration, a prerequisite for metastasis formation  <cit> .

the sponge protein nmegp1sd was compared primarily with human nme <dig>  for several reasons: i) the nmegp1sd is highly similar to vertebrate nme1/nme <dig> in primary structure, ii) human nme1/nme <dig> proteins are the most studied and well characterized group i nme members iii) nme <dig> is linked to metastasis suppression, but the suppression mechanism is not well understood. we expected that nmegp1sd analysis and the discovery of its biochemical features would shed some more light into the mechanisms connecting various nme <dig> functions and its antimetastatic activity. a recent study by domazet-lošo and tautz  <cit>  shows that, contrary to what might be intuitively expected, only a subset of cancer genes appeared simultaneously with multicellularity in animals and that the new genetic processes and gene functions that emerged at the basis of the metazoan lineage are major innovations which enabled complex interactions between metazoan cells. demosponges have only one group i nme protein , which is probably the ancestral condition for metazoans.

our results show that the sponge nmegp1sd possesses some biochemical characteristics typical for human nme <dig> and some typical for human nme <dig> protein. recombinant nmegp1sd appears to be predominantly in the hexameric form like human nme <dig> protein which was confirmed by gel filtration . the sponge nmegp1sd and human nme <dig> enzymes also have similar levels of kinase activity. human nme <dig> did not display an ability to bind sscdna, however, human nme <dig> can bind sscdna and showed the same dna band retardation effect as the sponge homolog. accordingly we decided to check the possibility that the sponge nmegp1sd is functionally more similar to nme <dig> than to nme <dig>  unlike nme <dig>  nme <dig> is able to cleave c-myc nhe sequence  <cit> . therefore, we tested whether the sponge nmegp1sd also has dna topoisomerase-like activity and found out that it is not able to cleave c-myc nhe sequence. we hypothesize that this was the ancestral condition of the nme group i protein before duplications and functional diversifications within the group i nme. sponge nmegp <dig> may have retained the multiple functions, while these functions have been partitioned between different vertebrate group i nme proteins. recent studies showed that sponge genomes are comparable to genomes of "higher" complex animals, including vertebrates, in terms of gene number and functional repertoire  <cit> . it was suggested that complex animals differ from their early simple relatives mainly in the more complex regulation of similar sets of genes. from that point of view, it could be speculated that the ability of nme <dig> to cleave c-myc is a relatively recent addition to the regulatory networks.

based on this evidence we then asked the following: what is the biological function of nmegp1sd in its native environment - the sponge cell? as it can suppress the migration of cal  <dig> cells e.g. replaces the human nme <dig> it could thus be involved in migration and/or, possibly, adhesion of sponge cells. it has previously been found that sponges possess genes/proteins for many advanced physiological processes usually linked to more complex metazoan phyla  <cit> . migration of cells in complex "higher" animals is limited to specific processes such as embryonic development and immune response and is closely controlled. cells are anchored in the developed tissues they belong to and do not migrate if not stimulated . the anchorage and migration of cells depends on a vast number of molecules such as cadherines, integrins, fibronectin and collagen. although sponges do not possess true tissues and organs, they do possess simple varieties of the mentioned proteins  <cit> . furthermore, they have complex pelagobenthic life cycles which include development to a larval phase and metamorphosis to sedentary adult form  <cit> . cell migration is present in sponges in three different processes: regeneration, larval development and the movement of amoeboid cells through the adult mesohyl; the space between the external and internal cell layers which is composed of galectin, collagen, fibronectin-like molecules and dermatoponin  <cit> . although the mesohyl is not a homogenous, organized structure, it resembles a primitive extracellular matrix . therefore, both the movement of amoeboid cells through the mesohyl in sponges and the movement of cells through ecm in vertebrates may originate from the same ancient precursor process present in the metazoan last common ancestor. from an evolutionary point of view, tumors likely developed together with the evolution of tissues and organs. it is not yet defined which biochemical functions of nme are crucial for its metastasis suppressor activity. it is, however, to be expected that its main biological function , would not be to suppress metastasis in "higher" metazoa but to control normal physiological processes  which, if left without control, could lead to metastasis formation. as sponges do not possess tissues and organs they are probably also incapable of forming tumors. the demonstration of the fact that the sponge nmegp1sd can replace human nme <dig> in human tumor cells encourages us to propose that the nmegp <dig>  function responsible for regulating adhesion/migration of cells was established in the metazoan ancestor well before the cambrian explosion i.e. before the appearance of diverse groups of multicellular metazoa. since tumors likely started developing in parallel with the development of true tissues and organs, this ancient function of nme <dig> was then adapted to act in a new highly significant role - the suppression of metastasis.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study emphasizes three major points: i) the single sponge group i nme gene and nme protein of suberites domuncula probably reflects the characteristics of the ancestral group i nme gene/protein, that existed prior to the duplication of this group in vertebrates and other lineages; ii) nmegp1sd possesses many biochemical properties of the most recent group i variant, the nme <dig> human homolog; iii) nmegp1sd interacts with human nme <dig> and can replace it in some biological functions which are usually associated with "higher" metazoans, specifically in metastasis suppression. therefore, we presume that the group i nme gene/protein of the metazoan last common ancestor was structurally and functionally similar to the multifunctional enzyme it is today.
