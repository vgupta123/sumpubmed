BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small rnas involved in post-transcriptional regulation of target mrnas, thereby regulating protein expression levels. mirnas have crucial roles in regulating a wide range of cellular functions, such as cell differentiation, proliferation and cell death  <cit> . recent studies have shown that secretory mirnas are found in body fluids including breast milk  <cit> , saliva  <cit> , plasma  <cit>  and urine  <cit> . the presence of circulating or secreted mirnas in these body fluids has suggested that secretory mirnas may function in extracellular cell to cell signalling and participate in intercellular regulation of cell function  <cit> . it has also been reported that secretory mirnas, and in particular milk mirna, may be secreted inside small vesicles called exosomes  <cit> . exosomes are small lipid-bilayer membrane vesicles, which are released by cells into the extracellular environment and carry various components including peptides, protein, mrnas and mirnas  <cit> . exosome packaging is considered as a key factor for the stability of secretory mirnas in the degrading conditions of the extracellular environment  <cit> . apart from being secreted in exosomes, milk mirnas may also be secreted by an alternative mechanism through milk fat globules  <cit> . production of milk is a complex process; milk is composed of various bioactive components supporting early development of the neonate  <cit> . therefore it is important to fully understand the functional role of mirna in milk. expression studies of milk mirnas have so far been reported in several eutherian species including human  <cit> , bovine  <cit> , pig  <cit>  and goat  <cit> , and have shown that a number of these mirnas are related to immune regulation, suggesting they may regulate the immune system of sucklings. in addition, mirnas are known to have important roles in various biological processes, including organogenesis and morphogenesis during fetal development. gene knockout studies in laboratory models such as zebra fish and mouse have demonstrated that mirnas are involved in development through post-transcriptional regulation of mrna expression  <cit> .

in mammals, the change from intrauterine to extrauterine life is a major transition that is exclusively supported by maternal milk provision. limited development of neonates is observed after a short gestation in primitive mammals like marsupials and monotremes, and milk has a vital role in supporting the development of immature new born during their early postnatal life  <cit> . during evolution of mammals, marsupials and eutherians have adopted different reproductive strategies which have given rise to a marked difference in maturation at birth  <cit> . eutherians, including humans, undergo a long gestation period allowing greater foetal development in utero and their composition of milk does not change significantly except for the short period of colostrum production at the onset of lactation  <cit> . in contrast, marsupials such as the tammar wallaby  have a short gestation followed by a long lactation, and the composition of milk changes significantly throughout the lactation cycle to provide factors for growth and development of the immature neonate  <cit> . as a result of a short gestation and long lactation period, a significant part of development and growth of the marsupial young occurs postnatally during early lactation  <cit> , and signalling factors necessary for development of the neonate may be secreted by the marsupial mammary gland  <cit> . mammalian neonates generally receive immune protection from milk  immediately after birth. in marsupials in particular, the newborn, which does not receive any passive immunity during foetal development, lacks a mature immune system and this renders them more vulnerable to pathogenic infections and therefore they are highly dependent on maternal immune source via milk for adequate protection  <cit> .

studies of the lactation systems of marsupial such as the allied rock wallaby   <cit> , the north american opossum   <cit>  and the tammar wallaby   <cit>  shown significant changes in their milk composition throughout lactation in marsupials. the tammar wallaby is the one of most studied marsupials and its lactation period is divided into three phases based on the composition of the milk, growth and behaviour of the young   <cit> . the tammar wallaby gives birth to a single altricial young after 28 days of gestation . the new born weighs approximately  <dig> milligrams at birth  <cit> . during the early phase of lactation , the young is permanently attached to the teat and the mother secretes dilute milk with a low concentration of protein and lipids but a high concentration of complex carbohydrates  <cit> . in mid-lactation  the young remains in the pouch without being permanently attached to the teat and milk composition remains similar although changes in milk protein composition have been observed  <cit> . during the final stage of lactation , the pouch young begins feeding on vegetation but still consumes milk from the mother. during this phase of lactation, the milk becomes rich in protein and lipids with a reduction in the concentration of carbohydrates  <cit> . the continuous change in the composition of milk proteins has important roles for the development of the pouch young  <cit>  and therefore the tammar provides an exceptional model to correlate milk composition with the defined developmental changes of joeys during lactation, and the identification of new activates in milk associated with molecular signals  <cit> .

the aims of the present study were first to confirm the presence and identify small rna in marsupial milk, particularly focusing on regulatory mirna, and to quantitatively profile the dynamics of marsupial milk mirna expression during the lactation cycle. in addition, this investigation compared mirna in lactating mothers milk and circulating blood serum in order to investigate the possibility of transfer of blood mirna into milk. finally the study evaluated the putative transfer of milk mirnas from the mother to the circulatory system of the neonate. overall, the study supports the concept that milk mirna represent new signalling agents in the molecular relationship between mother and young that has evolved in mammals.

RESULTS
tammar wallaby milk contains rna and is enriched in mirna
first, to confirm the presence of rna in marsupial milk, rna was purified from tammar wallaby milk collected at day  <dig>  the results confirmed that tammar milk contains significant quantities of total rna  and small rna . profiling on the bioanalyzer  showed that a large proportion of milk total rna was small rna 83%  with mirna representing approximately 66% of total milk rna . however, these values may be considered approximate, as the results are obtained from milk that has been through a single freeze-thaw cycle, even though the milk exosomal mirnas were shown to be partially stable during multiple freeze-thaw cycle  <cit> .figure  <dig>

to analyse the compartmentalisation of small rna in milk, tammar milk was fractionated by a series of ultracentrifugation steps followed by filtering as described in methods. small rna was shown to remain in the supernatant after ultracentrifugation at  <dig>  g for 1 hour and did not pass through a 100 kda filter , suggesting that the rna is likely associated with either high molecular weight complexes or small vesicles. tem microscopy of the rna enriched fraction  revealed that the fraction was also enriched in vesicles of  <dig> –80 nm diameter, exhibiting similar structure to exosomal vesicles previously reported in milk preparations from eutherian species  <cit> . these results suggest that rna is most likely transported within exosomes in tammar milk, although we cannot exclude association with large protein complexes. further, to analyse the stability of mirna in the milk exosome fraction under conditions similar to the stomach environment, the exosome preparations were incubated at ph <dig> and ph <dig> , and treated with rnase . free synthetic exogenous mirnas were added to the preparation as a control. the results showed that milk mirnas were more stable in acidic medium and highly resistant to rnase treatment in comparison to exogenous mirnas. this suggests that milk mirnas in exosome were protected, supporting exosome packaging as a likely factor for their stability.figure  <dig>

tammar wallaby milk mirna profiling
in order to characterise the small rna population of tammar milk, seven small rna libraries were sequenced on an illumina hiseq  <dig> sequencer. rna samples were isolated from milk at various stages of lactation and from two additional samples isolated from the blood serum of lactating wallabies also used for milk collection at  <dig> and 175 days of lactation. small rna library sequencing reactions produced from  <dig> to  <dig> million raw reads, which were cleaned by removal of low quality reads, reads contaminated with  <dig> prime and  <dig> prime adaptor sequences, adaptor only sequences and sequences shorter than  <dig> nucleotides . a total of  <dig> to  <dig> million high quality reads were recovered from the libraries. the sequence length distribution of small rna showed the highest abundance at 22 nt, indicating mirna-like sequences were the most abundant sequences identified in the majority of samples, representing from  <dig> to 62% of total rna sequence reads . milk samples from day- <dig> and phase- <dig> also showed a high proportion of 30–31 nt sequences mainly representing transfer rna fragments.table  <dig>

milk mirna profiles change during the lactation cycle of the tammar wallaby
as discussed earlier, the tammar lactation cycle is divided into three main stages; phase 2a , phase 2b  and phase  <dig> , with phase  <dig> corresponding to the period of gestation. while annotated mirna from serum consistently represented 60% of small rna sequences, this proportion varied for  <dig> to 60% of sequences from milk . in contrast, milk samples after day  <dig> of lactation had apparently a slightly more diverse mirna population than serum despite the fact that milk and serum samples were collected from the same lactating female at day  <dig> and day  <dig> . interestingly, this was due to a larger set of newly predicted mirna from milk. overall, the number of small rna sequences, unique reads and mirnas expressed in milk samples showed some variability due to contamination by trna fragments as observed above for day- <dig> and phase- <dig> samples and other experimental factors. therefore mirna only sequences annotated by miranalyzer were collected and proportion-normalised to allow a more relevant comparison of mirna populations; by dividing the total number of reads annotated for each mirna by the total number of mirna reads annotated in respective samples .

the ten most highly abundant mirnas in milk at five lactation time points and blood serum samples at day  <dig> and  <dig> of lactation are summarized in . mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were the most abundant mirnas in milk from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  mir- <dig> was also present in a very high proportion in the blood serum of mothers. mir- <dig> was highly abundant in phase-2a and early phase-2b. three mirnas of the let- <dig> family  were also among the top ten mirnas expressed during the lactation cycle. mir- <dig> was consistently in the  <dig> most abundant mirnas in all milk and serum samples. mir- <dig> showed a gradual increase in proportional abundance from early lactation to the end of phase-2b and was the most highly abundant mirna at day- <dig>  mirna- <dig> also showed a gradual increase in proportional abundance from early lactation with a peak in phase  <dig> .milk mirna expression data suggested that a number of mirnas were expressed differentially during lactation. based on the quantification of sequencing data we selected mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-30a and mir- <dig>  to confirm this differential temporal expression during the lactation cycle by qrt-pcr . as shown in figure  <dig> these mirnas were also shown to be differentially expressed in milk collected at similar time points of lactation from at least  <dig> different animals at each time point, excluding milk from the animals used for sequencing. the results correlated well with those from quantitative rna sequencing, therefore individual pcr confirmed differential temporal expression of all the tested mirna in milk collected from all other animals.figure  <dig>

co-expression of wallaby milk mirna
hierarchical clustering of normalised mirna proportion profiles showed blood samples were closely grouped together while milk samples were grouped on a different branch of the dendogram . in order to further identify trends in the co-expression of milk mirna during the lactation cycle, normalised mirna quantification data were clustered into  <dig> groups or clusters by the self organizing tree algorithm  implemented in mev  software, using default settings . the proportion of mirnas in each cluster is represented in table  <dig>  milk mirnas in cluster  <dig> had more variable relative concentration profiles dominated by a biphasic profile with increased proportions in early phase 2a and during phase 2b. this group included let- <dig> family mirnas members let-7a, let-7f and let-7i. cluster  <dig> was the smallest cluster encompassing only  <dig> mirnas. the highest expression values were reported on day- <dig> with decreasing relative expression thereafter. in cluster  <dig>  mirnas were highly represented up to day  <dig> with a gradual decrease in late lactation phases 2b and  <dig>  in cluster  <dig>  mirnas showed comparable expression across the whole lactation cycle, including mir- <dig> and mir10b, some of the three most highly expressed mirna in all samples. cluster  <dig> contained the highest number of mirnas . this cluster consisted mainly of milk mirnas expressed at all stages of lactation with consistent proportional increase from early to late lactation. the most notable mirnas in this group were mir- <dig>  mir-30a and mir- <dig>  the proportion of mirnas in each cluster is represented in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

comparison of mirna in wallaby milk and maternal serum
as only minute amount of milk could recovered during the earlier stages of lactation  and to minimize cost, we decided to target more specifically the transitional from phase 2b to phase  <dig>  lactating mothers at day  <dig> and day  <dig> were used to compare mirna profiles in milk and blood serum of the lactating mother. overall a similar number of specific mirnas were identified in milk  and serum . however, mirna composition was widely different in milk and serum . further analysis revealed that  <dig> mirnas were milk specific and  <dig> were serum specific . most of the serum specific mirnas had low read counts with the highest number of reads mapping to mir- <dig> . in contrast, milk specific mirnas showed comparatively high expression with, for example, mir- <dig> represented by  <dig>  reads. as shown in table  <dig>  other mirnas with over  <dig> read counts were mir-200b, mir-200c, mir-200a-5p and mir- <dig>  interestingly, the genomic locations of mir-200a and mir-200b genes are closely located within a chromosomal cluster. these results suggest co-expression and co-secretion of these closely linked mirna. the most abundant milk-enriched and serum-enriched mirnas are listed in table  <dig> with their respective normalized expression values. while mir- <dig> was most highly abundant in milk during the first three time points of lactation , its expression decreased on lactation day- <dig>  and at the same time, showed a marked increase in serum of mothers. although the data does not address the specificity and dynamics of circulating mirna exchanges between maternal blood and milk, and it remains to fully establish if mir- <dig> is instead no longer transferred from blood into milk from day  <dig>  this observation, together with the general disparity of milk and serum mirna profiles, suggests that there is no direct correlation between serum and milk mirna contents. therefore the data strongly supports the likelihood of local biogenesis of secretory mirna by the mammary gland rather than transfer from blood into milk.table  <dig>

quantification of milk related mirnas in pouch young and adult blood
to analyse the distribution pattern of milk related mirnas in blood of the pouch young, a subset of mirnas which were identified above as highly expressed in tammar milk compared to mother serum  was selected for validation by quantitative pcr. using the stem-loop rt-pcr method, these mirnas were quantified in serum of pouch young at lactation day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and weaned juvenile , a significant increase in levels of expression relative to adult  . generally, these mirnas were in higher proportion in pouch young serum than in the weaned juvenile . the result suggests that highly expressed milk mirna may transfer to the pouch young serum during early development when the immature gut may allow passive absorption of milk mirna. however, we cannot exclude independent endogenous biogenesis of mirnas in pouch young during early development and this would need to be assessed more directly in future experiments.figure  <dig>

discussion
in recent years, advances in sequencing technologies have allowed the identification of a mirna population in eutherian milk. in this study for the first time, we have confirmed there are also significant quantities of mirna present in marsupial milk using the tammar wallaby model.

milk provides optimal postnatal nutrition for newborn mammals  <cit> . milk composition has been investigated in many species  <cit>  and the milk proteins have been considered to make the major contribution to milk bioactivity  <cit> . however, newly identified milk rna components, such as mirna, represent not only potential markers of mammary gland development and activity during the lactation cycle, but also new putative signaling molecules involved in the programming of young development. however, milk mirna signaling responses in the suckled young have not yet been well defined. we hypothesised that the long lactation period of the wallaby with significant changes in milk composition would allow the characterisation of interesting dynamic patterns of mirna expression. cross-fostering experiments have shown that, when a young is fostered onto a mother at a more advanced stage of lactation, an increased rate of growth and of gut development is observed  <cit> . this indicates that the temporal regulation of milk composition may contribute to the control of development in young marsupials. therefore secretory milk mirna may participate in this process and, as a first step towards an understanding of the biogenesis and functional importance of milk mirna, our study has highlighted the rich diversity and detailed some aspects of the secretion dynamics of the majority of newly identified marsupial milk mirnas. one limitation of the study is that, as only minute amount of milk could recovered during the earlier stages of lactation  and to minimize cost, single sequencing reactions only were performed at each time point of lactation and it is therefore not possible to estimate biological variation and derive robust statistical models for the analysis of differential expression. to partially compensate for this limitation we have however taken care to normalise the data at the source by pooling milk from different animals  before rna extraction and mainly compared highly expressed mirna to address the major temporal trend of changes of expression patterns during of the full cycle of lactation rather than conduct differential analysis on pairs of samples.

when all known and co-expressed mirnas were clustered into  <dig> groups, the highest number of mirnas fell in a cluster showing a steady increase in expression from early to late lactation. the study suggests a steady increase in the number of mirnas and a general quantitative increase of a large group of mirna during the course of marsupial lactation. this general increase correlates with milk production, phases of mammary gland development during lactation in this organism with a complex lactation system, and the development of organs and improved physiological conditions of the young as it grows in the security of the pouch. this group of mirna may represent markers of mammary gland activity and putative growth signals. in contrast, the lowest number of mirnas was in a cluster showing a decrease from early to late lactation indicating mirna in this cluster are prime candidates for signalling early development of the young.

the serum mirna profiles were significantly different from all milk samples. some of the mirnas  were most dominantly expressed in wallaby serum samples and were comparatively low in milk samples. this observation points to a mammary gland biogenesis of mirnas and secretion in milk, rather than transfer from serum. although further detailed analysis of specific mirna is needed to characterise the diffusion of particular sequences, these results also suggest the possible development of milk quality control and diagnostic tests for the detection of infections or pathologies in lactating mammary glands based on the detection of serum specific mirna in milk.

the overall comparison of serum and milk mirna populations indicated the abundant milk mirnas were mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  let-7b, mir- <dig>  let-7d, mir-30a, mir- <dig>  let-7f and mir- <dig>  and the majority of these mirnas were differentially expressed during lactation . some mirnas showed a gradual proportional increase from early lactation to late lactation . in contrast, mir- <dig>  let-7f, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> showed a gradual decrease from early lactation to late lactation. in addition, mir- <dig>  mir-222a and mir- <dig> were uniquely expressed at day  <dig> of early lactation and decreased thereafter. some of these early temporally secreted milk mirnas are good candidates for developmental signals during early postnatal life.table  <dig>

role of mirna in mammary gland
the mammary gland is a complex organ, which undergoes extensive morphological changes during the lactation cycle, and this remodelling involves cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis  <cit> . several factors expressed in the microenvironment by epithelium and mesenchyma play key roles in regulating this process, apart from other external hormones and growth factors secreted by reproductive glands  <cit> . in general, the basic development process of the mammary gland is similar among marsupials  and eutherians, but events like cell proliferation and differentiation occur for an extended periods in tammars and, simultaneously, the volume of the mammary gland is increased as lactation progresses and larger quantities of milk are secreted  <cit> . recent studies have indicated an important role for mirna in mammary gland development  <cit>  and breast cancer  <cit> . for example mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are involved in early mammary gland development by regulating epithelial-stromal interactions  <cit>  and the temporal expression of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have potential roles in regulating cell proliferation in the mammary gland during pregnancy  <cit> . in tammar mir- <dig> showed a gradual increase in abundance in milk from early lactation to the end of phase-2b and was the most abundant mirna in wallaby milk at day- <dig>  it is also among the most highly abundant mirnas in all other mammalian species tested so far  <cit>  . mir- <dig> has been shown to be important for growth and development of normal tissues  <cit> , and may control growth of mammary epithelial cells. in addition, mir- <dig>  which was also shown to be expressed in tammar milk is involved in the regulation of lactation through stat <dig> protein expression  <cit> , as in the mammary gland stat <dig> plays a central role in mediating several pathways controlled by lactogenic and galactopoietic hormones  <cit> . here, we observed high concentration of mir- <dig> expression was highly expressed in milk samples compared to serum and expression gradually increased as lactation progressed and milk secretion increased. similarly, mir- <dig> has been implicated in the regulation of the innate immune response  <cit>  and the gradual increase in the expression of mir- <dig> during lactation may reflect its activity in protecting the mammary gland from microbial infection such as mastitis. the let-7b mirna is generally involved in cell proliferation  <cit>  and also regulates the expression of growth hormone receptors   <cit> . the gradual increase in expression of this mirna during tammar lactation may reflect mammary gland activity associated with cell proliferation and lipid metabolism as lactation progresses  <cit> . on other hand mir- <dig>  also consistently abundant in all wallaby milk and serum samples, has been implicated in many cellular processes related to the immune system  <cit>  and also in determination of cell fate and invasion  <cit> . in summary, all these molecules represent non-invasive candidate markers for physiologic and developmental analysis of the lactating mammary gland. more intriguingly, some of these mirnas might also function in newborns to control growth.

secretory milk mirna may regulate growth and development of the neonate
based on mirna expression patterns during lactation and the identification of milk specific mirnas, we speculate that some of these mirnas may represent promising candidates to signal specific development of the pouch young. the role of milk mirnas is being intensely debated in lactation biology. variation of mirna profiles may represent changes in the developmental and metabolic activity of the mammary gland during different stages of lactation and may be used further as biomarkers, or may be specifically secreted by the mammary gland to be transported to the newborn as milk bio-actives  <cit> . this new putative form of signalling and epigenetic programing between the mother and the neonate may use a sophisticated exosomal transport system. the majority of organs in a new-born tammar wallaby are still functionally immature and their postnatal development relies completely on maternal factors supplied through milk  <cit> . milk bioactives include growth factors, peptides, fatty acids and hormones. like other milk bioactives, milk mirnas may have a crucial role in development due to their participation in gene regulation. some of the most abundant milk mirnas are briefly discussed below in relation to their putative functions during development .table  <dig>

three members of the let- <dig> family  were abundant in tammar milk. the let- <dig> family has been shown to play a significant role during animal development  <cit> . in tammar milk mir- <dig> is highly expressed at day <dig> and is significantly down-regulated afterward, this mirna has been reported to control liver development and may play a role in liver development of pouch young. gradually increasing mirna were mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-30a, let7b and mir-130a and some of these mirnas have also been involved in animal development. mir- <dig> is expressed in organs linked to hormone secretion such as pancreas and pituitary gland and its expression level increases during pancreas organogenesis  <cit> . mice mir- <dig> knockouts exhibit a decrease in the number of β-cells and an increase of α-cells, leading to hyperglycaemia  <cit> . perhaps more significantly, this mirna has been shown to control the establishment of mucosal immunity in the gut via epithelial-t cell crosstalk, as demonstrated by the greater susceptibility to infection of gut specific knockout mice  <cit> . the large increase of mir- <dig> in phase  <dig> of lactation, when the young starts to exit the pouch and add grass to the diet supports the concept of a milk mirna contribution to the establishment of mucosal immunity in the young. on the other hand, mir- <dig> is uniquely expressed during early lactation  during which the altricial tammar neonate  is subject to intense nervous system and eye development  <cit> . interestingly, mir- <dig> regulates lens morphogenesis by controlling the expression of lens placode differentiation gene via the meis2/pax <dig> pathway  <cit> . other mirnas showed a gradual decrease during lactation . mir- <dig> was highly abundant in tammar milk during early lactation phase-2a until early phase-2b, mir- <dig> has a significant role in regulating the balance between neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation during development  <cit> . in marsupial at birth the central nervous system is at early stages of development and the majority of development takes place during early postnatal life  <cit> . therefore, the high expression of mir- <dig> in tammar milk during early lactation may have potential role in maturation of the central nervous system. further, the mir- <dig> family is involved in kidney development by regulating the extension of nephron through cell differentiation and proliferation, by targeting the xlim1/lhx <dig> transcription factor as shown in xenopus pronephros development  <cit> . from the expression data we noticed a peak expression of mir- <dig> in milk after day <dig> lactation, this may correlate with nephrogenesis in tammar pouch young as their urinary system starts to undergo maturation and become fully functional during late phase 2b and is not matured before 140 days  after birth  <cit> .

transport of milk mirnas to the pouch young through exosomes
our results indicate that milk mirnas are differentially expressed during tammar lactation and most mirnas are likely to be secreted by the mammary gland. to better understand how these mirnas were secreted into milk and the potential mechanism of uptake of milk mirnas by the suckling young, milk was fractionated by ultracentrifugation and size cut-off column filtration. the results showed that the majority of tammar milk mirna co-purified together with other small rna in a fraction enriched in exosome-like vesicles. these vesicules ranged from 30 nm to 70 nm in size and appeared round in shape, similar to exosomes reported in milk of eutherians, including bovine  <cit> , porcine  <cit>  and human  <cit>  species. these results suggest that mirnas in tammar milk are likely to be transported through exosome vesicles and potentially play a role in communication of a diversity of potential molecular signal between cells  <cit> . further analysis of these exosomal mirnas revealed they displayed stability under harsh conditions, indicating that milk mirnas may successfully be transported to the pouch young without degradation and may survive longer in the gut. therefore, the presence of exosome-like vesicles in milk suggests that these secretory vesicles may participate in the protective packaging and transport of bioactivities and signals to the neonate and during its subsequent development in the pouch. to address this important issue of a new signalling pathway between mother and young, the digestive system of the young needs to be considered. the digestive system of marsupials is very immature at birth  <cit>  and therefore tammar milk mirnas may be absorbed through the premature gut system of tammar pouch young and transferred into the blood of the neonate where they could be detected at high concentration. this is possibly in contrast with a majority of eutherians species where the digestive system is far more mature before birth and, soon after birth, the uptake of macromolecules such as immunoglobulins is rapidly ceased . the transfer of milk specific mirnas to the blood circulation of the neonate was detected for a number of highly concentrated milk mirna quantified in blood samples from pouch young at different stages of development, in contrast to the blood mirna content of the post suckling adult stage. it is important to consider that a majority of mirnas may be produced endogenously by the neonate, and therefore this study focused on mirnas that were shown to be overexpressed at least a thousand fold in milk compare to the mother serum mirnas, as known from mirna sequencing. from the qrt-pcr results it was observed that the majority of milk mirnas were present at high levels in the blood of neonates compared to adult blood serum. although these indirect results are preliminary and further studies will be required to demonstrate this process of exosome uptake by the gut, the present study suggests that milk mirnas are transported after packaging into exosomes  and that milk mirnas may be absorbed by the neonate gut system and enter the blood circulation. it is possible that exosomes carry specific surface receptors to attach to the gut cell wall, or that exosomes are digested in the gut where mirnas are secondarily released along with proteins before absorption by gut cells  <cit> . alternatively, exosomal vesicles may diffuse passively through the immature gut of the neonate. further studies are required to address this issue together with further characterisation of the detailed structure, biogenesis and molecular composition of milk exosomes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study mirna populations have been quantified in milk of the marsupial tammar wallaby. we have identified suite of marsupial milk mirnas and describe the major dynamics of milk mirna secretion during the complex lactation cycle of the tammar wallaby. in this marsupial model of lactation, pronounced temporal variation patterns of milk mirna composition have revealed mirna signatures that may be used to clarify the mirna-dependant regulation of mammary gland activity as well as the relevance of exosomal transport of the molecular mirna message towards protection and timing of specific developmental stages in the young. we report poor transfer of mirna from blood into milk in the mother, but provide evidence toward a likely transfer of milk mirna into the blood stream of the neonate. demonstrating the dynamics of milk mirna profiles across the tammar wallaby lactation cycle has highlighted the value of comparative quantitative transcriptomics to improve our understanding of milk composition and, more importantly, has paved the way to address the true potential of milk mirna functionality and the full impact of milk consumption on health and wellbeing.
