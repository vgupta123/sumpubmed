BACKGROUND
cotton is a fibre and oil-yielding crop grown worldwide. four species of cotton are generally cultivated  <cit> ; however, gossypium hirsutum l. contributes the most to the total lint cotton production worldwide  <cit> . cotton productivity is severely affected by both biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . approximately  <dig> species of insects have been reported to attack cotton plants. among these species, the aphid , the fall armyworm , the budworm , the cotton bollworm  and the cotton boll weevil  are the major pests affecting cotton culture  <cit> . the cotton boll weevil is undoubtedly the most devastating pest  <cit> . the adult female feeds, ovoposits, and develops primarily in cotton flower buds and fruits. after hatching, the larvae remain within the reproductive structures and use them as a food sources and a protected habitat to complete their life cycle. the endophytic behaviour of the larvae has made these insects difficult to control with conventional insecticides and other cultural practices  <cit> .

plants have evolved elaborate defence systems to respond in a rapid and effective way to herbivorous insects. numerous studies have revealed that, in addition to the constitutive defences comprised of trichomes, thick secondary cell walls, and toxic compounds, plants are equipped with inducible defences that can be grouped into indirect responses, such as the production of volatile odour blends to attract natural enemies of the attacking insect, and direct responses, such as the production of anti-digestive proteins, toxic secondary compounds, and enzymes that affect insect growth and development  <cit> . these two powerful defence systems evolved by plants during the long arms race with herbivores have enabled plants to survive  <cit> .

an appropriate defence response to a biotic threat requires initial recognition. herbivores or pathogens are recognised when conserved patterns of molecules, called herbivore- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns, hamp or pamp  are detected by pattern recognition receptors  on the surface of the host plant cell, leading to hamp-triggered immunity . damage-associated molecular patterns , which are endogenous molecules produced by the plant after infection, are also recognised by prr to trigger defensive reactions  <cit> . following the recognition of an attacker, plants use different signalling cascades to reprogram their phenotype. these include an interconnected network of signal transduction pathways depending mainly on the small regulators jasmonic acid , salicylic acid , and ethylene , concomitantly with ca+ <dig> ion fluxes, mitogen-activated protein kinases , transcription factors and reactive oxygen species   <cit> .

crop losses due to insects constitute one of the most significant constraints to the increase of global productivity and food production, estimated at 10-20% for major crops  <cit> . a better understanding of the diversity of plant responses to insect attacks and, in particular, the induced defences and their regulation, has generated interest in the scientific community to examine alternative strategies to protect plants and crops from insects pests by exploiting the endogenous resistance mechanisms exhibited by plants to most herbivorous insects. recent transcriptomics studies of plants exposed to herbivory identified a central role for transcripts that can lead to the development of insect-resistant crops . high-throughput sequencing of rna using next-generation sequencing platforms  offers a variety of new possibilities such as the transcriptional profiling of organisms lacking sequence information  <cit> , as well as the identification of novel loci, alternative splicing events  <cit> , and sequence variation  <cit> . thus, we decided to study the molecular responses of g. hirsutum flower buds to infestation by cotton boll weevil  larvae using the illumina hiseq™  <dig> platform. furthermore, we combined this approach with laser microdissection  to isolate rna from two different regions of tissue damaged by feeding larvae to evaluate the spatial expression pattern of the differentially expressed genes in response to feeding by cotton boll weevil larvae.

RESULTS
analyses of rna-seq data
to explore the response of g. hirsutum to tissue-chewing pests such as cotton boll weevil larvae, the flower bud transcriptome of infested plants was compared with control plants . two biological replicates for each condition were selected for transcriptome analyses with high-throughput parallel sequencing using hiseq™  <dig>  illumina. we generated  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads, and each sample was represented by at least  <dig> million reads, a tag density sufficient for quantitative analysis of gene expression   <cit> . the correlation between the two biological replicates was high .table  <dig>

overview of the changes in gene expression in response to feeding by cotton boll weevil larvae
the quantitative profiling of the transcriptome using degseq  analysis identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes  in cotton flower buds infested with cotton boll weevil larvae:  <dig> of them  were up-regulated, and  <dig>  were down-regulated compared to the control . among these deg,  <dig>  were identified as orthologues of a. thaliana genes by blastx with an e-value of 10− <dig> . to examine the range of genes involved in the response of cotton flower buds to inoculation with a. grandis larvae, the blast2go program was also used to confirm the annotation of differentially expressed transcripts . blast2go software returned functions for  <dig> % of the differentially expressed genes from species with greater blast hit distributions that included vitis vinifera, glycine max, populus trichocarpa, and threobroma cacao. of the deg, 76% had the same functional annotation between blastx with arabidopsis and the blast2go analysis .

to determine which genes and pathways were relevant responses to cotton boll weevil larvae feeding, a gene set enrichment analysis  approach was used. based on gsea, a hypergeometric test  was applied to identify which cellular components , molecular functions  and biological processes  were overrepresented in our list of deg. gsea revealed many deg putatively associated with the plasma membrane and cell wall in the cellular component category . most of the genes encoding plasma membrane proteins are receptor-like kinases , which are known to be involved in the perception of pathogen-derived elicitors. all rlk genes are up-regulated in infested plants in comparison to control plants . among the genes associated with the cell wall, there are up-regulated transcripts encoding a disease resistance protein  and cell wall-modifying enzymes, such as pectin methylesterase  and endotransglycosylase/hydrolase proteins  . many of the down-regulated genes encode cytosolic heat shock proteins such as hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> . these molecular chaperones assist in folding newly synthesised proteins and also in several other biological and cellular processes, such as cell growth, development and signal transduction during abiotic and biotic stress  <cit> .

with regard to molecular functions, the degs were mainly associated with sequence-specific dna binding transcription factor activity , calmodulin binding and calcium ion binding .table  <dig>

furthermore, gsea revealed significant biological processes altered in plants upon infection with cotton boll weevil larvae. we found that biological processes related to hormone biosynthesis and signalling, the response to organic substances, the regulation of biological processes, the detection of biotic stimuli, systemic acquired resistance, the respiratory burst involved in the defence response and innate immune responses were overrepresented by gsea . moreover, biological processes associated with defence against insects, such as the response to chitin, the regulation of the plant-type hypersensitive response , the regulation of programmed cell death and death were also represented . one hundred thirty-four transcripts were found in the “response to chitin” category , and  <dig> of them were also annotated with the gene ontology  term “death”  . of these, many transcripts encoded proteins involved in signal transduction such as receptor-like kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinases, calcium ion binding proteins and calmodulin-like proteins. in addition to genes associated with signal transduction, genes associated with hormone biosynthesis and the 26s proteasome pathway were annotated with the go term “response to chitin and death” .

the degs were mapped using mapman to generate a representative overview of the pathways affected . this analysis indicated the involvement of several genes in the biotic stress response including receptors recognising microbe-, pathogen-, herbivore- and damage-associated molecular patterns  as well as genes involved in triggering defensive responses such as transcription factors and the et and ja signalling pathways .figure  <dig>

main processes or pathways affected by the response to infection with cotton boll weevil larvae
several subsets of genes were identified, including protein kinases, ca2+-binding sensor proteins , genes responsive to oxidative stress, transcription factors, cell-wall modification genes and phytohormone-responsive genes.

genes associated with signal transduction: kinases, ca2+-binding proteins and protein degradation
an appropriate defence response to a biotic threat initially requires recognition of the threat. herbivore-associated molecular patterns such as chitin are detected by pattern recognition receptors  on the surface of the host plant cell, leading to hamp-triggered immunity. well-characterised plant prr comprises leucine-rich repeat  receptor-like kinases . members of this family of proteins have a common structure formed by an extracellular ligand-binding domain and a cytoplasmic kinase domain  <cit> . eleven rlk/lrr are differentially expressed  and annotated with the go term “response to chitin” and/or “death” , including receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase , receptor-like kinase localised on the plasma membrane , serine/threonine-protein kinase-like domain  and putative leucine rich repeat transmembrane protein kinase . recognition of conserved pamp by prr triggers intracellular signalling via mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascades followed by the activation of wrky transcription factors  <cit> . in our analysis, cotton boll weevil larvae affected the expression pattern of several mitogen-activated protein kinase genes. for instance, two mitogen activated protein kinases  that encode mapk <dig> in a. thaliana were transcriptionally up-regulated . similarly, a member of the map kinase kinase family  and a protein kinase kinase kinase  that play a role in leaf senescence during pathogenesis by alternaria blight in a. thaliana were also transcriptionally up-regulated  <cit> . the activation of mapk through wounding is dependent on the direct binding of calmodulins  in a ca2+ dependent manner. mechanical wounding and insect attack trigger a transient increase of cytosolic ca2+ levels within minutes. this ca2+ oscillation acts as a mediator for stimulus responses to several ca2+-binding proteins, such as calmodulins , calcineurin b-like proteins, and calcium-dependent protein kinases   <cit> . in our analysis, nine transcripts coding for calmodulin-like proteins, including eda <dig>  cml <dig>  cml <dig> and aca <dig>  were present in the deg related to chitin response. in arabidopsis, these genes are involved in plant innate immunity signalling and function as sensors of the signal generated by ca2+ influx into the cytosol   <cit> .

targeted protein degradation via the ubiquitin/26s-proteasome pathway is another important regulatory process. among the thirteen g. hirsutum genes annotated to be involved in this process, four were also related to the chitin and/or death go .

cotton boll weevil-induced transcription factor  genes
transcription factors serve as important regulators of biotic and abiotic stress responses by turning on or off the immune system during plant defence. our results suggest that the gene expression reprogramming in response to the boll weevil larvae feeding depends on many transcription factors . as many as  <dig> tfs, which are 20% of the degs, were differentially expressed after cotton boll weevil infection, with  <dig> up-regulated and only one down-regulated . among the tfs up-regulated by cotton boll weevil feeding, there are  <dig> ethylene response factors ,  <dig> wrky,  <dig> c2h <dig> zinc finger, nine helix–loop–helix , six c3h zinc finger, six myb, six nac and five gras . members of the ap2/ere and wrky families were also overrepresented in the study reported by libault et al.  <cit> , in which the expression patterns of arabidopsis transcription factors were analysed in response to purified chitooctaose. similarly, wei et al.  <cit>  observed that among the differentially expressed genes in arabidopsis leaves in response to diamond back moth feeding, there were  <dig> ethylene response factors  and  <dig> wrky. the erf subfamily belongs to the apetala <dig> /ethylene-responsive-element-binding protein  family, an ft family exclusive to plants. wrky transcription factors in plants are one of the largest families of zinc finger transcription factors and modulate development as well as responses to abiotic stresses, wounding, pathogens, and herbivore attack  <cit> . wrky tfs can act as both positive and negative regulators of plant defence pathways. the mechanisms activating wrky tf might involve the map kinase cascades and/or calcium signalling .

in the present study,  <dig> wrkys were up-regulated . considering the large number of genes in this family that were up-regulated in our experiment and their importance in the response to pathogen and herbivore attack, we investigated this tf family in more detail. a phylogenetic analysis including wrky genes from cotton and arabidopsis was performed . the phylogenetic analysis classified the cotton genes in the wrky clades and identified several putative cotton homologues to arabidopsis wrkys that have been previously characterised. among the genes with an altered response to cotton boll weevil larvae feeding, we identified nine wrky genes in cotton with putative homologues in arabidopsis that belong to group iii: wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>   <cit> . in addition, ghwrky40-like <dig> , ghwrky33-like <dig>  and ghwrky22-like <dig>  genes belong to group iia, i, and iie, respectively . other zinc finger-containing transcription factors from the c2h <dig> and c3h families were also up-regulated during boll weevil larvae feeding. members of these families are also up-regulated by aphid and pseudomonas syringae attack in arabidopsis
 <cit>  . myb proteins are central regulators of development, metabolism, and the response to abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . in our analysis, we found six up-regulated genes coding for r2r3-myb tfs . defence responses regulated by myb transcription factors promote hr-related cell death and resistance against bacterial and necrotrophic pathogens. myb transcription factors also play roles in the defence response against insects. small cabbage white caterpillars  induce local expression of atmyb102
 <cit> . nac transcription factors have been shown to regulate plant development, phytohormone signalling and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . six nac genes were differentially expressed in response to cotton boll weevil larvae feeding . some nac genes are up-regulated in response to feeding by diamond back moths, wounding, and bacterial infection  <cit> . bhlh transcription factors regulate plant cell and tissue development as well as phytohormone signalling. a limited number of bhlh transcription factors characterised to date have been found to be involved in the defence against pathogens or pests. nine bhlh tfs were consistently up-regulated in this study. other differentially expressed  transcription factors belonging to the gras family play diverse roles in root and shoot development, gibberellic acid  signalling, phytochrome a signal transduction and the chitin induced defence response  <cit> . we focused on three members of the ap2/ere family and nine members of the wrky family to further characterise the response to cotton boll weevil feeding by qpcr analysis .figure  <dig>

arabidopsis
. the amino acid sequences of the wrky domain of cotton and arabidopsis were aligned with muscle, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the jtt model with an estimated γ-distribution parameter . the maximum-likelihood analyses were performed with the program phyml version  <dig> , and assessment of node confidence was performed using  <dig>  bootstrap replicates. the members of group i, ii  and iii are labelled according to the classifications of atwrky domains by eulgem et al.  <cit> . the triangles indicate cotton wrky genes, and filled triangles represent the genes analysed by qpcr. contig <dig> was named ghwrky70-like1; was named contig <dig> ghwrky64-like1; and contig <dig> was named ghwrky72-like <dig> after calculating the p-distance to determine the closest relationship with arabidopsis members.



oxidative stress-related genes affected by cotton boll weevil feeding
oxidative radicals play an important role in plants during various stresses, including biotic stress such as insect infestation  <cit> . among the genes up-regulated by oxidative stress, a transcript encoding the respiratory burst oxidative homolog d  protein, a key enzyme involved in the reduction of reactive oxygen species  during the defence response, was identified. in addition, grx <dig>  a member of the glutaredoxin family that catalyses thiol disulphide reduction and might be a candidate controlling the redox state of regulatory proteins, was also up-regulated. grx <dig> might represent a potential regulatory component of sa/ja antagonism  <cit> .

phytohormone-related genes induced by the boll weevil larvae feeding
phytohormones are crucial in the stimulation of defence to insect herbivory. several signalling pathways, including ja, sa, and et, are believed to orchestrate the induction of insect defences  <cit> . genes associated with the biosynthesis, signalling and response to stimuli by ja, sa, aba  and et phytohormones were significantly overrepresented in the flower bud transcriptome affected by the boll weevil based on hypergeometric distribution analysis  . for instance, the genes associated with jasmonate biosynthesis are well represented among the genes up-regulated by cotton boll weevil feeding, including lipoxygenase , allene oxide synthesis , and jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase . we identified genes associated with salicylic acid signalling, a widely known phytohormone involved in the induction of pathogen resistance  genes as well as in the establishment of long-term immunity via the sar pathways  <cit>  . in addition, other genes up-regulated by boll weevil feeding are involved in aba catabolism and et biosynthesis. these include the gene encoding the aba 8′-hydroxylase , which catalyses the first step in the oxidative inactivation of aba  <cit> . the genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis acs  and aco  were also up-regulated after herbivory .

down-regulated genes involved in the response to cotton boll weevil feeding
several putative genes involved in cell wall formation and degradation were identified as down-regulated. contig <dig> was one of the most highly down-regulated genes in our study . contig <dig> is similar to genes belonging to the invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor family, from which some genes are known to be involved in cell wall modification but have also been reported to play an important role in basal disease resistance  <cit> . other genes with potential roles in cell wall reorganisation were down-regulated, such as an endoxyloglucan transferase , which has a role in primary cell wall restructuring, as well as an alpha/beta hydrolase  and a beta-expansin  . interestingly, many down-regulated genes encoding heat shock proteins  and one heat shock transcription factor  were observed. among them, five belong to the small hsp family, four to the hsp <dig> family and six to the hsp <dig> family .

validation of transcriptome data and evaluation of the spatial expression pattern of defence-related genes in response to infestation by cotton boll weevil larvae using “in situ” qpcr
to better characterise the potential role of some genes in plant defence against insect herbivory, we selected  <dig> degs that responded to feeding by the cotton boll weevil larvae. these genes function in different levels of the biotic stress defence response signalling pathway  and were annotated in biological processes such as the response to chitin and/or cell death . initially, these were analysed with real-time qpcr on 6 mm cotton flower buds infected by larvae or the control samples for further validation of the transcriptome data. the expression patterns observed between the rna sequencing  and qpcr methods were highly similar , indicating the accuracy of our transcriptome profile. to verify this observation, we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient  between the different methods for all transcripts, and a correlation coefficient of  <dig>   was observed.

to evaluate the spatial expression pattern of these genes by “in situ” qpcr, two different areas of the 6 mm cotton flower buds were isolated by laser microdissection : the stamens  and the carpels  . among the  <dig> up-regulated genes selected for analysis,  <dig> were up-regulated in both organs. only cml <dig> showed a contrasting expression pattern of up-regulation in the stamens  but down-regulation in the carpels  . the spatial expression analysis of four down-regulated genes showed that all four were repressed in stamens and carpels . we also evaluated if the expression near the feeding site  was significantly different from the expression away from the damaged tissue . among the  <dig> genes tested by qpcr, transcripts from  <dig> genes were more highly expressed near the feeding site . a few genes, such as the transcription factors ghwrky19-like <dig>  ghwrky22-like <dig>  ghwrky40-like <dig> and erf- <dig> and the rbohh and hsp <dig>  genes were more highly expressed in carpel tissues compared to stamen tissues .figure  <dig>

the differentially expressed transcriptome of cotton in response to boll weevil larvae feeding
to further evaluate whether cotton and arabidopsis share a common gene set in response to tissue-chewing pests, we compared the differentially expressed transcriptome with the publicly available microarray data set geo: gse <dig> . we also used a gsea approach to determine the genes and pathways that were relevant in response to 24 hours of continuous dbm feeding and identified the biological processes that were overrepresented in the ordered list of deg in this experiment . we found several similarities between the cotton transcriptome and the public domain microarray data in terms of enriched biological processes. biological processes related to hormone biosynthesis and signalling, such as ja, sa, et and aba, the responses to organic substances, the negative regulation of programmed cell death, the detection of biotic stimuli, systemic acquired resistance and the regulation of the immune response were overrepresented in both gsea analyses. however, there were obvious differences in the enriched biological processes, including the response to auxin, gibberellin stimulus and secondary metabolite biosynthetic processes. these biological processes are overrepresented only in the leaf transcriptome analysis of arabidopsis infested by dmb. on the other hand, the response to chitin and signalling are biological processes overrepresented in cotton flower buds damaged by cotton boll weevil larvae. there were only nine up-regulated genes that overlapped between the cotton larvae in floral tissue and the leaf injured by diamond back moth . among them, there were transcripts encoding proteins that repress ja signalling, such as jaz <dig> , jaz <dig> , and jas <dig>  as well as a disease resistance protein lrr  that specifically recognises pathogen effectors, resulting in effector-triggered immunity . another gene represented in both data sets is a lipoxygenase  that dioxygenates unsaturated fatty acids, leading to the lipoperoxidation of biological membranes. loxs are involved in the apoptosis  pathway and in biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants  <cit> . finally, the gene 2-oxoglutarate and fe-dependent oxygenase , which is involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway and implicated in the synthesis of defence compounds, was found in both data sets and was also induced by pieris brassicae eggs and pieris rapae herbivory  <cit> . we found only one gene that was down-regulated in both experiments: a germin-like protein  with oxalate oxidase activity leading to hydrogen peroxide  production, which is a ros that is implicated in the herbivory-induced response in plants  <cit> .figure  <dig>

discussion
g. hirsutum l. is an allotetraploid species with a large and complex genome, and comprehensive sequence information describing the genome is still incomplete. moreover, previous studies have provided limited information on the transcriptional dynamics during the cotton defence response  <cit> . the recent availability of high-throughput sequencing technologies provides an unprecedented opportunity to thoroughly explore the defence response using large-scale expression profile analysis despite uncharacterised genomic sequences. in the present study, using massive parallel mrnaseq, we report the transcriptional changes in g. hirsutum l. flower buds in response to cotton boll weevil  larvae feeding. to this end, eggs from a. grandis that were ready to hatch were placed on stamens inside 6 mm flower buds, the stage at which the round unicellular microspores are found in the locules. cotton boll weevil larvae chew for ~48 h on flower tissues, representing the early steps of insect damage. it has been suggested that pollen grains are the initial target of the larvae after egg hatching  <cit> . subsequently, the larvae migrate to the ovary where they feed in the ovules and conclude their life cycle, leading to the abscission of floral structures  <cit> .

in this study, we generated over  <dig> million sequence reads  of raw sequence data using the illumina sequencing of two biological replicates from 6 mm cotton flower buds damaged by cotton boll weevil larvae and undamaged flower buds. at the current level of sampling , the sensitivity of the rnaseq approach allowed the accurate identification of differentially expressed genes.

a previous study in cotton showed by rna-seq that the transcriptome changes after pathogen  inoculation, although they generated only  <dig> million tags of 21 bp in length  <cit> . dubey et al.  <cit>  analysed the leaf transcriptome of cotton plants infested by aphids and whiteflies, generating a total of  <dig>  million high quality reads through rna-seq. in our study, the number of up-regulated genes  was much greater than the number of down-regulated genes  after damage by cotton boll weevil larvae. these results are supported by previous reports showing that larval feeding stimulates induction rather than suppression of genes  <cit> . several studies have examined the transcriptional profiles of different modalities of attack, such as pathogen or insect  <cit> . however, our results contrast with results observed in cotton plants damaged by whiteflies and aphids, in which the number of down-regulated genes was greater than the number of up-regulated genes in both cases after damage  <cit> .

the mapman analysis of the degs generated a representative overview of the plant response after larvae damage . this analysis suggested that the cotton plant could perceive boll weevil larvae-derived physical and chemical cues such as compounds in the oviposition fluid, chitin, and insect oral secretions. these elicitors dramatically alter the expression of several genes in the plant immune response pathways that are involved in biotic stress response. the herbivory-induced changes are mediated by elaborate signalling networks, including receptors/sensors, ca2+ influx, kinase cascades, transcription factors, reactive oxygen species and phytohormone signalling pathways. we were able to identify genes belonging to all major networks previously described and thus relate these to the plant response to herbivory.

the plant immune system is activated by various herbivore -associated molecular patterns  that are detected as non-self molecules. such patterns are recognised by immune receptors that are either cytoplasmic or localised on the plasma membrane. cell surface receptors include receptor-like kinases  that frequently contain extracellular leucine-rich repeats and an intracellular kinase domain for the activation of downstream signalling, as well as receptor-like proteins  that lack this signalling domain. it is therefore hypothesised that rlks are required for rlps to activate downstream signalling  <cit> . several putative receptor-like kinases, such as the homologues of ccr <dig>  ripk and evr, were up-regulated after cotton boll weevil larvae damage . ccr <dig> encodes a transmembrane protein kinase  previously characterised as a key gene in the plant-insect interaction. little et al.  <cit>  showed that  <dig> rlks, including ccr <dig>  were induced by oviposition by p. brassicae, suggesting that rlks play an important role in the detection of herbivore-associated molecular patterns. interestingly, ccr <dig> was significantly more highly expressed in the stamen close to the larval damage than in the carpel, as assessed by our in situ qpcr analysis . furthermore, the ripk gene encodes a cytoplasmic nb-lrr immune receptor that recognises the avrb and avrrpm <dig> effectors from pseudomonas syringae, leading to the activation of eti  <cit> . this gene was also more highly expressed in the stamen than in the carpel tissue in our in situ qpcr analysis. another leucine rich repeat transmembrane protein kinases analysed in our study, evr, was equally induced by boll weevil larvae in the stamen and the carpel, is also expressed in response to p. syringae, and is involved in the regulation of cell death and innate immunity   <cit> .

the recognition of conserved hamp, such as chitin or fatty acid-amino acid conjugates  by prr triggers intracellular signalling via a mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascade  <cit> . our study identified homologues to mapk <dig>  and mkk <dig>  genes with the go term “response to chitin”. the in situ qpcr analysis showed that these genes were highly expressed in the stamen and carpel from cotton flower buds infested by boll weevil larvae . mapk, mapkk, and mapkkk activate several transcription factors such as erfs and wrkys during the response to pest attacks, as has been shown for erf-5
 <cit> . a previous study in arabidopsis showed that erf- <dig> is phosphorylated by mapk <dig> , suggesting that erf- <dig> might play an important role in plant defence by positively regulating ethylene  signalling  <cit> . the gherf- <dig> and gherf- <dig> genes were more highly expressed in the stamen than in the carpel, and the gherf- <dig> gene was slightly more highly expressed in the carpel . erf- <dig>  erf- <dig> and erf- <dig> belong to the ap2/ereb family and were previously identified in the response to nematode or fungal inoculation  as well as in response to chitin, a main elicitor of the plant defence response against insects  <cit> .

rnaseq analysis identified transcripts for  <dig> tfs that were differentially expressed in 6 mm cotton flower buds damaged by boll weevil larvae. in the present study, we selected the  <dig> cotton genes identified as wrky for a phylogenetic analysis in combination with the full set of arabidopsis wrky genes. the expression patterns of nine wrky genes were explored in detail with a combination of lmd and qpcr. the transcript level of ghwrky30-like <dig> gene was the same in stamen and carpel tissue and was induced relative to the control. ghwrky33-like, ghwrky46-like <dig>  ghwrky64-like <dig>  ghwrky70-like <dig> and ghwrky72-like <dig> were more highly expressed near the damage in stamen tissues. in arabidopsis, it was also shown that wrky <dig> is specifically induced by salicylic acid  and infection by the biotrophic pathogen p. syringae, working redundantly with the structurally related genes wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> to positively regulate basal resistance to p. syringae
 <cit> . previous results have shown that the arabidopsis wrky genes are rapidly and strongly induced by chitin  <cit> . some wrkys are target genes of the upstream mapk <dig> , such as wrky <dig>  studies in arabidopsis have shown that in response to pathogen invasion, mapk <dig>  phosphorylates wrky <dig>  which directly binds to the w-boxes in the promoter of the acs <dig> gene in vivo, suggesting that wrky <dig> is directly involved in the activation of acs <dig> expression downstream of the mapk <dig> cascade  <cit> . this signalling event produces high levels of ethylene, which plays an important role in plant immunity. moreover, atwrky <dig> is required to activate the synthesis of antimicrobial substances such as camalexin  <cit> . interestingly, the other three wrky genes  showed a higher expression in the carpel than in the stamen. in an elegant series of experiments, asai et al.  <cit>  showed that atwrky <dig> functions downstream of the flagellin receptor, a leucine-rich repeat  receptor kinase, and that a mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascade conferred resistance to bacterial  and fungal  pathogens. these results strongly indicate that signalling events initiated by boll weevil larvae feeding might converge on a conserved system of pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition, a mapk cascade and transcription factors.

relatively little is known about the signal transduction pathways triggered by insect damage. calcium ions  have been implicated as a second messenger in many plant signalling pathways including responses to herbivory  <cit> . it has been shown that mechanical wounding and insect damage trigger a transient increase in cytosolic ca2+ levels  <cit> . for instance, the egyptian cotton worm  caused a transient increase in cytosolic ca2+ in phaseolus lunatus cells adjacent to the insect damage  <cit> . cotton genes encoding calmodulin-like proteins  showed a higher expression close to the damage  than in carpels, suggesting that these proteins might be a component of ca2+ signalling that modulate plant defence responses against herbivory attack.

several studies have revealed that ros are implicated in herbivory-induced responses in plants  <cit> . superoxide anion , hydrogen peroxide , singlet oxygen , and hydroxyl radical  are collectively called ros; they are produced in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and peroxisomes, as well as on the external surfaces of plasma membranes. feeding of helicoverpa zea on soybean, as well as s. littoralis and tetranychus urticae feeding on medicago truncatula plants, increase ros levels  <cit> . our analysis identified several transcripts encoding enzymes directly involved in oxidative stress that are up-regulated in response to feeding by boll weevil larvae. in situ qpcr analysis showed that transcripts encoding an nadph oxidase  were expressed at a higher level in carpel tissues than in stamen tissues compared to the control samples . atrbohd was largely responsible for the accumulation of ros during the defence response in arabidopsis against p. syringae and peronospora parasitica
 <cit> . our results suggest that the oxidative burst is also part of the cotton plant’s response to boll weevil larvae feeding.

the boll weevil larval damage in flower buds also induced the expression of genes associated with phytohormone biosynthetic processes and signalling. among the gene transcripts associated with ja, et and aba biosynthesis selected for analysis by qpcr were aos, acs, aco and cyp701a <dig>  all of these genes showed a significantly higher expression in the stamen and carpel tissue compared to the control samples. among the ja metabolism genes that modulate plant responses to biotic stress by boll weevil larvae are aos, which encodes the second enzyme involved in ja biosynthesis, and jmt, which is involved in the synthesis of the volatile compound methyl-ja  used for plant defence. jasmonate plays a central role in regulating the defence responses to herbivores that inflict various types of tissue damage. jasmonate mutants are affected in their resistance to a wide range of arthropod herbivores, including caterpillars , beetles , thrips  and leafhoppers   <cit> . jasmonate has been associated with the synthesis of proteinase inhibitors , defence-related volatile compounds and secondary metabolites, such as nicotine, active phenolics and phytoalexins  <cit> . the genes involved in the et biosynthesis pathway, acs and aco, were also up-regulated by boll weevil larvae damage. the primary function of et in plant resistance to herbivores is the fine-tuning of ja-induced responses  <cit> . in tomato plants, et potentiates the ja-induced transcript accumulation of secondary metabolites such as pis  <cit> . the treatment of arabidopsis plants with ethephon, a synthetic et donor, transiently elevates the levels of ja and aos transcripts  <cit> . blocking the perception of et with 1-mcp diminishes herbivory-induced volatile emission, which is mainly regulated by ja  <cit> . by using plants that ectopically express a loss-of-function etr gene, von dahl et al.  <cit>  showed that et signalling is crucial for increasing basal levels of nicotine, an effective defence against herbivory. these results indicated that ja and et may be involved in elevating the basal resistance of cotton plants to herbivory.

the ubiquitin-ligase genes are also known to play a role in the plant defence response  <cit> . yang et al.  <cit>  showed that the e <dig> ligase activity of arabidopsis pub <dig> is required for the initiation of the hypersensitive response . therefore, two predicted members of this family, pub <dig> and cmpg <dig>  which are among the degs in our experiment and were annotated in response to chitin and/or death, were also analysed by in situ qpcr. spatial analysis of gene expression revealed that the transcripts of both genes were strongly up-regulated at the site close to the damage  compared to carpel tissues. these genes are among the  <dig> ubiquitin-ligase genes that up-regulated either  <dig> or 30 min after chitooctaose treatment in arabidopsis
 <cit> . previous studies have shown that the expression of the pub <dig> gene in arabidopsis was induced by pamps and infection by pathogens. moreover, the pub22/pub23/pub <dig> triple mutant displayed negative regulation of pamp-triggered immunity  <cit> .

among the repressed gene transcripts related to the herbivory response, we identified transcripts for one germin-like protein  and many genes encoding heat shock proteins . qpcr analysis revealed that the ger <dig> transcript was strongly down-regulated in the stamen and in the carpel . interestingly, ger <dig> is included in the overlap between the down-regulated genes of the leaf transcriptome analysis of arabidopsis damaged by dmb larvae and our study . ger <dig> leads to hydrogen peroxide  production, a type of ros that is implicated in the herbivory-induced response in plants, and was also repressed by p. brassicae eggs and p. rapae herbivory in a study in a. thaliana
 <cit> . the transcriptional repression of genes encoding the heat shock proteins hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig>  was observed in both stamen and carpel tissues . in many plant species, hsp <dig> isoforms are required for disease resistance against invading pathogens. hsp <dig> interacts with the disease resistance signalling components sgt1b and rar <dig> and is required for rps2-mediated resistance, a disease resistance  intracellular protein that specifically recognises pathogen effectors. for example, the athsp <dig>  and athsp <dig>  genes in arabidopsis are required for rps2-mediated resistance against p. syringae expressing avrrpt <dig> and for rpm1-mediated resistance to p. syringae expressing avrrpm <dig>  respectively . hsp <dig> is also essential for rx-mediated resistance to potato virus x , n-mediated resistance to tobacco mosaic virus, and pto-mediated resistance to p. syringae expressing avrpto
 <cit> . in contrast, the hsp <dig> - <dig> mutant with a point mutation in the atp-binding domain of athsp <dig>  is known to be more sensitive to biotrophic pathogens. in our results, several hsp genes were down-regulated, suggesting that larvae attempt to overcome the plant immune defence triggered by the effector.

CONCLUSIONS
alternative strategies for protecting crops from insect pests are exploring the endogenous resistance mechanisms exhibited by plants to most herbivore insects through a greater understanding of induced defences in plants. this study aimed to unravel the changes in the transcriptome of g. hirsutum flower buds in response to feeding by cotton boll weevil  larvae. a large number of cotton transcripts and biological processes were significantly altered upon larvae infestation. among the changes observed, we highlighted the induction of transcripts for the receptors/sensors that recognise chitin, insect oral secretions and signals from injured plant cells; differential modulation of transcripts encoding enzymes related to kinase cascades; transcription factors ; ca2+ influx; reactive oxygen species; and modulation of transcripts encoding enzymes from phytohormone signalling pathways, mainly the ja and et pathways. cotton boll weevil larvae feeding affected many genes that have also been shown to be regulated in response to microbial or fungal infection, indicating the existence of complex crosstalk in the response to these different pathogens. the qpcr analysis associated with microdissection showed that almost all of the genes were more highly expressed in the stamen, the region close to the damage caused by larvae feeding, than in the carpel, farther away from the injured area. however, herbivory-induced defence responses in cotton flower buds were observed not only in the wounded regions but also in undamaged regions of the damaged flower buds. it is possible that a signal travels to other parts of the flower bud that transmit an herbivory alert. although the identity of the mobile signal responsible for this systemic response remains unknown in many plants, studies performed in solanaceous plants demonstrated that herbivory rapidly induces a short-distance mobile signal that travels and activates mapks and triggers ja accumulation. deciphering the signals that regulate herbivore-responsive gene expression in g. hirsutum flower buds might provide new strategies to manipulate this response for the production of insect-resistant transgenic plants.
