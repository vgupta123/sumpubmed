BACKGROUND
increasing evidence has shown that stem cell development requires a niche – a local microenvironment housing stem cells that regulates their self-renewal and fate in developing tissues or organs  <cit> . the regulatory signals from a niche are provided by niche cells, soluble factors and the extracellular matrix . despite many studies showing that soluble factors such as fgfs, bmps and wnts can regulate stem cell behavior, the role of cell-matrix interactions in stem cell development is poorly understood. the ecm as a major niche element provides not only a scaffold for cellular support, but also an immediate microenvironment that triggers regulatory signals to support stem cell proliferation, migration and fate decision  <cit> . the ecm is a complex mixture of matrix molecules which are typically large glycoproteins, including the fibronectins, collagens, laminins and proteoglycans that assemble into fibrils or other complex macromolecular arrays. cell adhesion to the ecm transmits extracellular signals to stem cells via integrin receptors which are heterodimeric receptors generated by selective pairing between  <dig> α and  <dig> β subunits. the complexity of the extracellular environment is revealed by examination of the special and temporal expression of patterns of ecm components and some of their cell surface receptors in the developing central nervous system  and the peripheral nervous system. abundant ecm is present at the time when neural progenitors differentiate, migrate and neuronal axons elongate, but expression of ecm proteins is substantially reduced by the end of development  <cit> . the diversity of cell interactions with complex ecm components in the developing cns challenges us to understand the role of cell-matrix interactions in neural differentiation of stem cells.

the ability of embryonic stem  cells to generate neural cell types in vitro offers a powerful tool to study how the cell-ecm interactions regulate neural stem cell specification and lineage choice. recent studies on mouse embryonic stem cells  showed that ecm signaling influences the developmental fate of pluripotent stem cells, and the temporally restricted cell-ecm interactions direct fate and specification of neural precursors derived from mescs  <cit> . in the present study, we used a reproducible, chemically-defined adherent culture system to direct highly purified neural commitment from human embryonic stem cells . the robust neuroectodermal cells in neural rosettes were generated and further differentiated into neural progenitors and neurons; glial cells did not appear until  <dig> weeks later. this system allowed us to study quantitatively how ecm components affect the neural progenitor generation and migration from hescs and the neurite outgrowth of developing neurons. among the  <dig> substrates tested  hesc-derived neural progenitor expansion, migration and differentiation into neurons were significantly greater on laminin and laminin-rich matrigel than on other substrates. laminin stimulated hesc-derived neural progenitor expansion, neuronal generation and neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner. the laminin-induced neural progenitor expansion was partially blocked by antibody against integrin α <dig> or β <dig> suggesting that laminin/α6β1integrin signaling plays a critical role in the directed neural differentiation of hescs.

RESULTS
derivation of highly homogenous neural progenitors and neurons from hes cells
human es cell lines te <dig> and te <dig> were maintained and passaged weekly on mitomycin c treated mouse cf- <dig> embryonic fibroblasts. colonies of hescs were removed from feeders, triturated and re-plated in low attachment dishes to obtain spontaneously differentiating ebs. neuroectodermal differentiation was induced in floating ebs in the neural differentiation medium . we found a marked change in appearance of differentiating ebs during culturing with the ndm. by  <dig> days of culture in the ndm , most ebs exhibited a solid, dark core surrounded by a light band which we called "dark ebs" . however, if continually cultured a few more days in suspension with the ndm, some ebs gradually became transparent capsules which we called "light ebs" . both dark- and light-ebs were plated onto cell culture dishes coated with pdl, pdl/fibronectin, pdl/laminin, collagen and matrigel. neural rosettes were readily visualized in plated ebs on all substrates except on pdl. without clonal isolation of neural rosettes, the neuroectodermal cells in the rosettes further differentiated into neural progenitors, neurons and glia on these adherent substrates. after being plated on pdl/laminin substrates, the dark ebs generated the first nestin+ neural progenitors at  <dig> hours postplating, and the first tuj1+ neurons appeared  <dig> hours after the nestin+ neural progenitors generated. from a dark eb, new neural precursors and neurons were constantly generated and migrated radially away from the center of aggregates, resulting in a rim of cells around the eb sphere . while the dark ebs gave rise to a mixed population of nestin+ neural progenitors and tuj1+ neurons , the light ebs produced highly pure nestin+ progenitors with a few or no tuj1+ cells . in both cases, gfap+ astrocytes and o4+ developing oligodendrocytes did not appear until  <dig> weeks later. figure  <dig> shows time-lapse images of these two distinct differentiation patterns from dark ebs and light ebs respectively.

to quantify the percentage of neural progenitors and neurons within hesc-derived differentiated cells, a double immunocytochemical analysis for nestin and tuj <dig> was carried out in cultures with nuclear dapi counterstaining at  <dig> days postplating on ecm substrates . the dark ebs-derived neural cells exhibited a radial configuration; new neural precursors were constantly generated from the dark eb spheres followed by robust neuronal generation. both neural progenitors and neurons migrated rapidly away from the center of aggregates . in the mixed neural population the ratio of nestin+ to tuj1+ cells varied markedly between ebs-derived aggregates. by counting the cells positive for nestin or tuj <dig> and the number of phase-dark cells positive to dapi in figure  <dig>  75% ±  <dig> % of differentiated cells expressed nestin and 24% ±  <dig> % expressed tuj <dig>  figure  <dig> shows a light ebs-derived neural population. almost all differentiated cells were nestin+ neural progenitors. by counting the cells positive for nestin or tuj <dig> over the number of cells positive to dapi,  <dig> % ±  <dig> % of differentiated cells expressed nestin and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % expressed tuj <dig> 

hesc-derived neural rosettes appear on various ecm substrates
neuroectodermal precursors in neural rosettes were induced by replating ebs into the ndm. while the markers of undifferentiated hesc such as oct3/ <dig> and ssea <dig> progressively disappeared , a number of rosettes gradually emerged throughout the eb. although neural rosettes were seen in floating ebs, more rosettes were generated after the ebs were plated on pdl/laminin , matrigel  and collagen  substrates, but not on pdl. these radial neuroectodermal cells were morphologically similar to polarized neuroepithelial structures of the developing cns. immunostaining of neuroectodermal cells in rosettes for early neural markers sox <dig> and nestin, and the neuronal marker tuj <dig>  showed that the radially organized columnar neuroepithelial cells co-expressed sox <dig> and nestin . therefore, neural rosettes are considered as in vitro organized neuroectoderm  <cit> . it was interesting to notice that the antibody against neuronal marker tuj <dig> not only stained rosette cell-derived neurons, but also radially distributed fiber-like structures in rosettes . about 5– <dig> days later, the rosettes were often transformed into neural tube like structures .

hesc-derived neural progenitors are highly proliferative and multipotent
our reproducible protocol generated robust hesc-derived neuroectodermal cells giving rise to highly homogenous nestin+ neural progenitors that undergo extensive cell division before differentiating into neuronal and glial cells. to assay the ability of self-renewal of hesc-derived neural progenitors, cells at  <dig> days of differentiation  were exposed to brdu for  <dig> hours before double immunostaining for nestin and brdu. the percentage of nuclei positive for brdu among the nestin-positive cell population was about 68% , indicating that hesc-derived neural progenitors were actively synthesizing dna. to characterize the extent to which rosette cells can differentiate into all three neural cell lineages, we used immunocytochemical analysis of cells cultured on pdl/laminin substrates with a panel of antibodies and demonstrated that hesc-derived neural derivatives sequentially expressed sox <dig>  nestin, musashi , a2b <dig> and ps-ncam, followed by tuj <dig> expression in many cells in first 1– <dig> days postplating on pdl/laminin substrates. map2+ and gabaergic  neurons appeared at about 10– <dig> days on pdl/laminin substrates. gfap+ astrocytes and o4+ developing oligodendrocytes did not appear until after  <dig> days of culture on pdl/laminin substrates .

neural progenitor expansion and differentiation into neurons are significantly greater on laminin or laminin-rich matrigel
to examine the effect of substrates on the overall growth  of neural progenitors derived from dark ebs, similar sized  ebs with equal number of neural progenitors were chosen at  <dig> h postplating. the number of nestin+ cells grown on different substrates was quantified over time at  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h postplating from randomly selected fields. a comparison of cell counts at these  <dig> time points showed significantly greater cell expansion on pdl/laminin or matrigel at 12– <dig> h postplating than on other substrates . at  <dig> h postplating, the nestin+ cell number increased on pdl/laminin by approximately 4-fold and on matrigel by about 3-fold. a comparison of tuj1+ cells grown on these  <dig> substrates also indicated that laminin and matrigel stimulated significantly higher numbers of hesc-derived neurons compared to the other substrates .

neurite outgrowth of hesc-derived neurons is greater on laminin and laminin-rich matrigel
to evaluate the effect of substrates on the neurite outgrowth of hesc-derived neurons, quantification of the number of primary neurites and total neurite length per cell was carried out on neurons derived from the light ebs. the hesc-derived neurons were identified using immunocytochemistry with the antibody against tuj <dig> . hesc-derived neurons on laminin and matrigel had significantly greater numbers of neurites and total neurite length per cell than neurons on other substrates . the total neurite length per cell on laminin slightly greater than on matrigel, but this difference was not statistically significant . therefore, laminin-supported neurite outgrowth was comparable to matrigel.

laminin stimulates neural progenitor expansion and neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner
results from above show that laminin is a particularly effective ecm substrate for stimulating hesc-derived neural progenitor expansion and neuronal neurite outgrowth. to examine a possible dose-dependent relationship between laminin concentrations and hesc-derived neurogenesis, we evaluated the hesc-derived neural progenitor expansion and total neurite length of neurons on culture dishes coated with pdl/laminin substrates. laminin was used at the following  <dig> concentrations:  <dig> μg/ml ,  <dig> μg/ml ,  <dig> μg/ml ,  <dig> μg/ml  and  <dig> μg/ml . we observed that both neural progenitor expansion and total neurite length increased in response to increased laminin concentrations from <dig> μg/ml to  <dig> μg/ml. the cell expansion and neurite outgrowth declined at higher laminin concentration  .

distributions of integrins α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> in hesc-derived neural progenitors
integrins comprise a large family of cell adhesion molecules that mediate interactions between the extracellular environment and the cytoplasm. since hesc-derived neural progenitors were predominantly interacting with laminin, we examined if the neural progenitors express the laminin-associated integrin subunits. it is known that integrin β <dig> is widely expressed in human postnatal cortices-derived neural progenitor cells  <cit> . it forms noncovalent complexes with various integrin alpha subunits, including α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  to become the functional receptors that bind specifically to laminin. flow cytometry showed that the human neural progenitor cells express the laminin-associated integrins α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig>  <cit> . we carried out immunostaining of hesc-derived neural progenitors at  <dig> days postplating on pdl/laminin for integrins α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig>  all these integrin subunits were detectable to differing degrees. cell counting of immunoreacted vs total number of cells revealed that 98% ±  <dig> % cells expressed β <dig> subunit and 46% ± 8% cells expressed α <dig> subunit. there were 38% ± 4% α <dig> positive cells, 12% ± 3% α <dig> positive cells, and 15% ± 3% β <dig> positive cells found in hesc-derived neural progenitors.

blockage of α <dig> or β <dig> integrin disrupts expansion of hesc-derived neural progenitors on laminin substrates
results above demonstrated that, compared with other substrates, hesc-derived neural progenitors showed strongest responses to laminin substrates in their migration, expansion and differentiation into neurons. recent studies have shown that almost all human neural stem and progenitor cells express the β1integrin subunit and a significant percentage of human neural progenitors express a <dig> subunit  <cit> . to assess the role of endogenous a <dig> and β1integrins in hesc-derived neural progenitor migration and expansion on pdl/laminin substrates, antibody perturbation experiments were performed in dark ebs-derived neural populations cultured at  <dig> h postplating. we marked the similar sized  dark ebs at the day of plating  in total  <dig> cell culture dishes coated with pdl/laminin at concentration of  <dig> μg/ml. these dishes were divided into  <dig> groups: no treatment , treated with the antibody against a <dig> integrin , treated with the antibody against β <dig> integrin  and treated with purified mouse igg . cell expansions were estimated at  <dig> h postplating by measuring expansion distances from the edge of the eb sphere to the widest point of the rim . it was found that hesc-derived neural progenitors treated with a <dig> or β1integrin antibody exhibited significant decreases in cell expansion distances  compared to non-treated cells  or cells treated with mouse igg . cells untreated or treated with mouse igg showed no significant difference in cell expansion, whereas statistical differences between a <dig> or β <dig> integrin antibody-treated cells and values for control cultures were found significant . this result indicates that a6β1integrin mediated, at least in part, hesc-derived neural progenitor responses to laminin, suggesting a critical role for laminin/a <dig> or β1integrin signaling in hesc-derived neural progenitor cell migration and expansion.

discussion
our work demonstrates that laminin and laminin-rich matrigel significantly enhanced directed hesc differentiation into neural progenitors and neurons compared with pdl, fibronectin and type i collagen. robust neuroectodermal precursors in neural rosettes were formed on laminin substrates and differentiated into greater numbers of neural progenitors and neurons with greater neurite outgrowth. we also found that laminin stimulated neural progenitor expansion and neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner; the antibody against α <dig> or β1integrin subunit partially blocked the laminin-stimulated expansion of hesc-derived neural progenitors. these results indicate that the endogenous α <dig> and β <dig> integrin subunits were in part responsible for transmitting laminin signaling into the cell to stimulate hesc-derived neural progenitor expansion and neuronal differentiation, suggesting that laminin/α6β1integrin signaling plays a significant role in the directed neural differentiation of hescs.

the directed neural differentiation of hescs in culture is a dynamic process which is essentially a recapitulation of early embryonic developmental processes  <cit> . our results from neural differentiation of hescs in vitro are consistent with recent findings from in vivo studies. evidence has shown that embryonic neural tissues contain a dynamic ecm, composed of many types of molecules that have distinct patterns of spatial and temporal expression. the laminin family is one of the most important ecm components within the neural stem cell niche. neural stem cells derived from the mouse vz, svz and the rostral migratory stream  to the olfactory bulb express high levels of integrin α6β <dig> and its ligand laminin  <cit> . antibodies against the α <dig> or β <dig> integrin subunits can disrupt neuroblast migration, suggesting an endogenous role for α6β <dig> integrin in guiding migration; laminin is a chemoattractant for neuroblasts of the svz/rms, drawing neuroblasts away from their normal course of migration in a restricted fashion when injected as a tract of intact laminin, and in a dispersed fashion when provided as a more soluble peptide  <cit> . the latter studies emphasize a critical role of α6β <dig> integrin and its ligand, laminin, in controlling the direction of migrating neuroblasts in the adult cns.

the responses of hesc-derived neural progenitors to ecm molecules found in the present study are similar to those of neural stem/precursor cells dissociated from human postnatal cortices  <cit>  or from mouse ganglionic eminence  <cit> . in the latter studies, laminin matrices enhanced human neural stem cell migration, expansion and differentiation into neurons and astrocytes, and elongation of neurites from nspc-derived neurons compared to poly-l-ornithine and fibronectin. ours and other studies indicate laminin interactions with α6β <dig> integrin represent one of the most important cell-ecm interactions as an early inductive signal to regulate neural stem and progenitor cell proliferation, migration and fate decision in vitro and within the embryonic mammalian brain.

in the present study we focused on the involvement of the ecm components in the generation and migration of neural progenitors and neurite outgrowth of neurons during the neural specification of hesc. laminin served as a potent stimulator of neural differentiation of hescs while other tested ecm components showed similar but much less enhancement of these events. recent evidence has increased our awareness of the diversity and complexity of the cell-matrix interactions. ecm components have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on neural cell development  <cit> , and much remains to be elucidated about how interactions with the ecm generate inductive signals that regulate the hesc differentiation in vivo and in vitro. on the other hand, cells in tissues encounter the composition of the ecm, rather than a single ecm protein. for example, the basement membrane and connective tissue contain networks of multiple ecm proteins including laminin, fibronectin and several collagen isoforms. study of the role of combined ecm components, which regulate hesc-derived neural phenotypes, will greatly facilitate their use as model systems for neural development study and as therapeutic agents for cell replacement.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated using a defined adherent culture system that neural derivation from hescs was significantly enhanced by laminin or laminin-rich matrigel compared to pdl, fibronectin and type i collagen substrates. laminin stimulated neural progenitor generation, expansion and differentiation into neurons, as well as neurite outgrowth of hesc-derived neurons. the laminin-induced neural progenitor expansion was partially blocked by the antibody against α <dig> or β <dig> integrin. these results implicate a possible role of laminin/α6β <dig> integrin signaling in directed neural differentiation of hescs. this finding is consistent with a significant role of laminin/integrin signaling in regulation of neural stem cell generation, migration and differentiation within the ventricular zone of cns. thus, cell-ecm interactions appear to be an early inductive signal to regulate neural specification of hescs. our findings may facilitate studies of early human cns development and potential applications in neurological diseases.
