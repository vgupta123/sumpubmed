BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  of the central nervous system  is a devastating and often fatal disease, primarily affecting young children. even when treatment is administered in a timely manner, mortality is extraordinarily high, with surviving patients often experiencing severe neurological sequelae. cns tb comprises approximately 1% of tb disease worldwide, disproportionately affecting children in developing nations  <cit> . coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus increases the likelihood of cns tb  <cit> , and the emergence of drug resistant strains further complicates cns tb due to limited permeability at the blood-brain barrier  of several second-line tb drugs. delays in treatment due to drug-susceptibility testing further reduce the efficacy of available patient care  <cit> .

the cns is protected from the systemic circulation by the bbb, composed principally of specialized and tightly apposed brain microvascular endothelia , supported by astrocyte processes  <cit> . according to the widely accepted hypothesis by rich et al , lesions  develop around bacteria seeded in the brain parenchyma and meninges during the initial hematogenous dissemination. subsequent rupture of these foci results in the release of bacteria directly into the csf, causing extensive inflammation and meningitis  <cit> . the onset of meningitis is most commonly observed in young children , and is also associated with hiv co-infection or recent corticosteroid use  <cit> . in addition to host risk factors, recent clinical reports have indicated the association of distinct mycobacterium tuberculosis strains with cns disease  <cit> , and microbial factors which promote cns disease have been identified in numerous other neuroinvasive pathogens  <cit> . while it is clear that m. tuberculosis invade the cns and that microbial factors may be required for cns disease, the identity of such virulence determinants remains elusive.

we previously described a murine model of cns tb utilizing hematogenous dissemination to the cns, and identified m. tuberculosis genes required for cns disease  <cit> . we developed a similar model of cns tb in the guinea pig, which, unlike mice, develop well-defined, necrotic granulomas in response to m. tuberculosis infection  <cit> , and were also utilized by rich et al for their seminal work on cns tb  <cit> . by screening and characterizing several hundred m. tuberculosis transposon  mutants, we identified m. tuberculosis pknd as a key microbial factor required for cns disease.

RESULTS
m. tuberculosis genes required for cns disease
guinea pigs were infected by intravenous injection of  <dig> ×  <dig> m. tuberculosis. animals become moribund and succumb to pulmonary and disseminated disease 24- <dig> days after such an infection, thus  <dig> days was chosen as the end-point for our mutant screens. whole brain cfu were reliably >  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu at day  <dig> 

 <dig> genotypically-defined m. tuberculosis tn disruption mutants, each with a disruption in a single gene were screened . the mutant output pool  was compared to input pool . mutants attenuated in the cns were also tested for their survival phenotype in the lung tissue. of the  <dig> mutants analyzed,  <dig> were found to exhibit cns-specific attenuation . no corresponding defects were observed for these mutants in lung tissue  . similar results were obtained when attenuation in the brain was compared with lung tissues . one of the  <dig> mutants identified in the screen, m. tuberculosis pknd , was highly attenuated in the guinea pig brain, and was also identified to have a cns-specific phenotype in our previously reported work utilizing the murine model  <cit> . polar effects on the predicted operon partner psts <dig> are not expected, as pknd is located downstream of psts <dig>  additionally, nearby downstream genes are oriented in the opposite direction to pknd.

mutants for the above genes were found to be significantly attenuated in the guinea pig cns, but not lungs,  <dig> days after intravenous infection. selected mutants were attenuated greater than 16-fold in the cns and less than 4-fold in the lung tissue . mutants annotated as "nd" were not detected in the brain in quantities detectable by pcr, and were therefore likely highly attenuated in cns tissue.

to verify our results from the pooled infections, we tested the m. tuberculosis pknd mutant individually. mice were intravenously infected with m. tuberculosis wild-type or pknd mutant strains and sacrificed at days  <dig> and  <dig> following infection. equal numbers of the m. tuberculosis wild-type and pknd mutant strains were implanted at day  <dig> in the brain  and lungs  respectively . note that even though a modest invasion defect is expected for the pknd mutant, the in vivo models are not powered to reliably observe these modest differences at day  <dig>  which, however, are amplified by day  <dig>  the m. tuberculosis pknd mutant was significantly attenuated for survival in the brain , compared to the wild-type strain , but not in the lung tissue . taken together with our observations during pooled infection in both mice and guinea pigs, these data indicate a cns-associated defect for the m. tuberculosis pknd mutant.

m. tuberculosis pknd is necessary for invasion of cns-derived endothelia
to determine whether the observed phenotype was due to a specific interaction with host cells likely to encounter m. tuberculosis in cns or lung tissues, invasion assays were performed in activated j <dig> macrophages and non-professional phagocytic cells . huvec and a <dig> were chosen as they represent the most commonly used endothelial and pulmonary epithelial cells, respectively, employed for pathogen studies. infections were performed with m. tuberculosis wild-type, pknd mutant, or a strain which was complemented with the pknd/psts <dig> operon. strain cq <dig>  an intergenic m. tuberculosis tn mutant, was used as a negative control, while m. tuberculosis rv0442c mutant, known to be attenuated in macrophages  <cit> , was used as a positive control for macrophage experiments. the pknd mutant demonstrated an invasion defect in hbmec after  <dig> minutes of infection , a defect restored by complementation . these results were confirmed in three independent experiments. invasion of a <dig> or huvec by the pknd mutant was not significantly lower than that of wild-type .

since macrophages are the key host cells that interact with m. tuberculosis in the lungs, bacterial survival assays were also performed to assess the role of pknd in activated j <dig> macrophages. host cells were lysed and bacteria cultured at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> following infection. bacterial counts for the pknd mutant remained below that of wild type bacteria in hbmec at days  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  during the course of the infection . when accounting for the reduced invasion at day  <dig>  an intracellular survival defect was still observed at days  <dig>  and  <dig> . no corresponding defect was observed for the pknd mutant at any time point in macrophages . these data indicate that the cns-associated defect of the pknd mutant may be due to defective invasion and survival in brain endothelia.

the pknd extracellular domain is sufficient to trigger adhesion and invasion of brain endothelia
in order to determine whether the presence of pknd protein is sufficient for invasion, fluorescent microspheres were coated with either recombinant pknd sensor or bovine serum albumin . host cell actin cytoskeleton was stained with alexafluor 488-phalloidin. coated microspheres were incubated with brain endothelia  for  <dig> minutes, followed by extensive washing. confocal microscopy demonstrated that higher numbers of pknd-coated microspheres adhered to hbmec than in the case of bsa-coated control microspheres . additionally, the pknd-coated microspheres were largely embedded within indentations of actin and near sites of actin protrusion . several microspheres were visually confirmed to be intracellular after the inoculation . a significant increase in fluorescence was observed in wells containing pknd-coated microspheres relative to those containing their bsa-coated counterparts  . adherence of pknd-coated microspheres  to hbmec was significantly reduced by pre-incubation with anti-pknd serum, when compared to incubation with naïve antiserum  .

in order to determine whether microspheres were invading and present intracellularly, the above incubations were repeated, and cells analyzed by flow cytometry. we observed that, in samples incubated with pknd-coated microspheres,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of hbmec contained fluorescent spheres, while only  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of cells incubated with bsa-coated microspheres were positive for fluorescence . microspheres were again incubated with anti-pknd serum, and internalization by hbmec was significantly reduced when compared to incubation with naïve serum  . together, these data indicate that m. tuberculosis pknd is sufficient to trigger uptake by brain endothelia.

m. tuberculosis pknd mutant exhibits reduced adherence to a component of the host ecm
since m. tuberculosis pknd sensor is homologous to proteins that bind to the host ecm, we measured the adherence of m. tuberculosis pknd mutant to major components of the ecm using laminin, collagen, and fibronectin matrices generated in vitro. the m. tuberculosis pknd mutant demonstrated a reduction in association with the in vitro laminin matrix , but not to collagen or fibronectin matrices . endothelia secrete laminin to generate a matrix for adhesion and maintenance of cell structure. to determine whether pknd protein associates with laminin secreted by brain endothelia, pknd-coated microspheres were incubated with hbmec and stained for host laminin. it was observed that, relative to bsa-coated microspheres, pknd-coated microspheres were more likely to localize with the laminin-stained hbmec .

invasion of brain endothelial cells by m. tuberculosis is reduced by anti-pknd serum
following observations that anti-pknd serum reduces adhesion and invasion of pknd-coated microspheres, similar experiments were performed using live m. tuberculosis. m. tuberculosis exposed to pknd-specific antibodies at a dilution of 1: <dig> were significantly attenuated in their ability to invade the brain endothelium relative to those bacteria incubated with naïve serum  .

discussion
recent clinical studies have observed the association of m. tuberculosis strains with cns disease  <cit> , and suggest that m. tuberculosis may possess virulence factors which promote cns involvement. m. leprae ml-lbp <dig>  for instance , has been shown to be involved in schwann cell invasion via laminin- <dig>  <cit> , while m. tuberculosis malate synthase has been shown to bind ecm associated with a <dig> cells  <cit> . additionally, the heparin-binding hemagglutinin of m. tuberculosis has been shown to be required for extra-pulmonary dissemination  <cit> .

we utilized both the guinea pig and mouse models of hematogenous dissemination to the cns in this study. in previous experiments with single strain infections, we have regularly observed a high degree of bacillary invasion of the guinea pig cns. when performing an intravenous infection, we can reliably reproduce conditions where greater than  <dig>  bacilli are present in the brain over a  <dig> week infection. whole brain cfu in the mouse after an intravenous infection are lower than in the guinea pig  <cit> . this is important during our pooled infections when  <dig> mutants are simultaneously injected as we need an adequate total bacillary burden to provide sufficent numbers of each individual mutant. a burden of  <dig> , for instance, would yield approximately  <dig> bacilli for each mutant. if only  <dig> bacilli were present , we would likely not be able to draw definite conclusions. this was not a concern during single mutant infections, as only one strain was present. we therefore used the mouse, which is also a reliable model  <cit> , and is more feasible for performing the single strain infections. an additional benefit of using multiple animal systems is the validation provided by replicating our findings in several in vivo models. as described above, the m. tuberculosis pknd mutant was found to be highly attenuated in both animal models.

since the cns is protected from the systemic circulation by the bbb, m. tuberculosis can initiate cns tb by crossing the bbb as extracellular organisms or via infected monocytes or neutrophils. while the latter hypothesis seems attractive, such cellular traffic is severely restricted across the barrier before the onset of tb meningitis  <cit> . moreover, patients with cns tb and meningitis have extensive blood vessel involvement and significant endovasculitis with the intima  most severely affected  <cit> . goldzieher et al. have further shown that m. tuberculosis can be found inside brain endothelia of patients with tb meningitis  <cit> . seminal work by rich et al, later confirmed by macgregor and colleagues, demonstrated that free m. tuberculosis can invade the cns  <cit> . more modern data utilizing cd18-/- leukocyte adhesion deficient mice suggest that free mycobacteria can traverse the bbb independent of leukocytes or macrophages  <cit> . these data emphasize the central role of brain endothelia in the pathogenesis of cns tb and underscore the importance of our observation that the pknd mutant displayed defective invasion and reduced survival in brain endothelia. while endothelial cells are not professionally phagocytic, they are capable of mounting an antibacterial response through the release of antimicrobial peptides. activation of endothelial barriers can also trigger bacterial killing via no- or h2o2-dependent pathways  <cit> . it is possible that disruption of pknd disables a bacterial response pathway necessary for survival in these unique conditions, resulting in the reduced intracellular growth we observed during infection of brain endothelial cells.

reduced invasion was not observed in other cells previously utilized to evaluate invasion and dissemination defects of m. tuberculosis mutants and clinical strains  <cit> . however, one of the limitations of the current study is that other cns cell types such as microglia and astrocytes, which could play a role in mycobacterial infection and killing in vivo, were not evaluated.

m. tuberculosis pknd encodes a "eukaryotic-like" stpk, a family of bacterial signaling proteins. stpks occur in numerous pathogenic bacteria, and m. tuberculosis encodes  <dig> putative stpks . good et al have demonstrated that the m. tuberculosis pknd sensor is composed of a highly symmetric six-bladed β-propeller forming a cup with a functional binding surface  <cit> . the β-propeller is a widespread motif found mostly in eukaryotes, although it was first described in influenza virus neuraminidase  <cit> . takagi et al have shown that nidogen, a β-propeller-containing protein in humans which is homologous to the sensor domain of m. tuberculosis pknd, is required for binding to laminin  <cit> . similarly, trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan pathogen that causes meningoencephalitis in humans, has a pknd homolog , also possessing a β-propeller, that selectively binds to laminin  <cit> . in accordance with bioinformatics predictions, m. tuberculosis pknd has been identified as an integral membrane protein in several proteomics studies  <cit> . we therefore hypothesized that the pknd sensor domain could be assisting in bacterial adherence by association with host ecm components, and our in vitro data are consistent with this hypothesis. moreover, since brain endothelia associate principally with laminin  <dig> and  <dig>  not present in epithelia and endothelia elsewhere  <cit> , we postulate that the observed cns tropism of pknd may be due to its interaction with cns-associated laminin isoforms.

bacterial stpks are candidates for sensing the environment and regulation of microbial metabolic states  <cit> . the m. tuberculosis pknd intracellular kinase has been previously demonstrated to associate with and phosphorylate intracellular targets including mmpl <dig>  <cit>  and the putative anti-anti-sigma factor rv0516c, regulating sigf-associated genes  <cit> . m. tuberculosis sigf is an alternative sigma factor implicated in stress response, stationary phase, dormancy, and late-stage disease in vivo  <cit> . our previously published data demonstrate that m. tuberculosis significantly down-regulate transcription, protein synthesis, and energy metabolism very early after invasion by brain endothelia  <cit> . these data raise the possibility that interaction with the host cns may mediate bacterial signaling. the two domain structure of pknd invites the hypothesis that an extracellular signal, possibly a host factor, may induce an intracellular cascade via activity of the kinase and regulation of sigf. an ortholog of m. tuberculosis pknb in bacillus subtilis has been demonstrated to regulate bacterial dormancy by a similar mechanism  <cit> . the potential induction of sigf-mediated cellular activity via pknd could confer upon m. tuberculosis a survival advantage in unique conditions such as the brain endothelium.

m. tuberculosis are well known to adapt to a quiescent dormant state. however, the precise location of dormant bacilli during human latent tb infection remains elusive. immune surveillance of foreign antigens is relatively limited in the cns  <cit> , and mycobacteria escape immune recognition following direct inoculation into the brain parenchyma  <cit> . we therefore postulate that the unique microenvironment in the cns is advantageous for bacterial survival, and may provide a sanctuary to dormant m. tuberculosis. while this study examines and indicates a role for m. tuberculosis pknd in the initial stages of invasion and infection, the role of dormancy in cns disease will be an active area of research for our future studies.

given the above data, we hypothesize that interaction of pknd protein with a host extracellular factor, possibly laminin, facilitates adhesion of m. tuberculosis to the microvascular endothelium of the cns. other neurotropic pathogens have been shown to trigger host-mediated uptake and internalization of bacteria through cytoskeletal rearrangement, thus this represents a possible mechanism for future study  <cit> . given the multi-domain structure of pknd, extracellular engagement of the sensor domain could transduce a signal to the intracellular kinase, triggering a bacterial state, possibly dormancy, which is more amenable to uptake and survival in the microenvironment of the cns.

it should also be noted that the pknd sensor domain occurs only in pathogenic mycobacteria, and is present in all sequenced clinical strains. polymorphisms in the pknd gene or its promoter could therefore account for variable cns tropism of distinct lineages of m. tuberculosis. studies evaluating polymorphisms in m. tuberculosis isolated from patients with cns or pulmonary disease are currently underway and may shed light on the clinical relevance of pknd or other such genes potentially involved with promoting cns tb. finally, it is important to note that bacterial invasion of host cells could be neutralized by an antibody raised against the extracellular  domain of m. tuberculosis pknd. this is encouraging and suggests a potential role for pknd as a therapeutic target against cns tb.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified several m. tuberculosis genes which play a role in cns tb, and have discovered a novel biological function for m. tuberculosis pknd in cns disease. our findings were associated with cns tissue, and were not observed in the lungs. we further found that pknd is required for invasion of cells lining the brain endothelium, and that the m. tuberculosis pknd sensor is sufficient to trigger invasion of brain endothelia. this process was neutralized by specific antiserum, which demonstrates promising therapeutic potential. these data present a unique and novel role for this serine-threonine protein kinase. knowledge gained from further study of pknd, and other candidates identified in this study, may lead to the development of preventive strategies for cns tb, a devastating and under-studied disease. moreover, these studies may also shed light on extra-pulmonary reservoirs for dormant m. tuberculosis.
