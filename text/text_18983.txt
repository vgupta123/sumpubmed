BACKGROUND
nematodes have a generally conserved body plan. their typical form is dictated by the presence of a single-chamber hydroskeleton, where longitudinal muscles act against an inextensible extracellular cuticle. the conservation of organ systems between nematode species is even more striking, with, for example, the nervous system, the somatic gonad and the vulva having very similar general organisations and cellular morphologies across the phylum. it might be thought that these similarities arise from highly stereotypical developmental programmes, but comparative studies challenge this “all nematodes are equal” view.

embryonic development of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans has become a paradigmatic model for studying developmental processes in animals, including early soma-germline separation, fate specification including inductive interactions, and tissue-specific differentiation. the particular mode of development of c. elegans is distinct within the major metazoan model organisms, but much of the regulatory logic of its development is comparable to that observed in other phyla. one key aspect in which c. elegans differs from vertebrate and arthropod models is that c. elegans shows a strictly determined development  <cit> , with a largely invariant cell-lineage giving rise to predictable sets of differentiated cells  <cit> . inductive cell-cell interactions are, nevertheless, essential for its correct development  <cit> . c. elegans is a rhabditid nematode, one of approximately  <dig>  described and  <dig> million estimated nematode species. molecular and morphological systematics of the phylum nematoda identify two classes: chromadorea , and enoplea   <cit>  . c. elegans is a chromadorean, and most investigation of developmental biology of nematodes has been carried out on chromadorean species. the first description of the early embryonic cell-lineage of a nematode, that of ascaris  in the 1880’s  <cit> , conforms to the c. elegans model. early development across all suborders of the rhabditida is very similar  <cit> . in general, only minor variations of the division pattern observed in c. elegans have been described in these nematodes  <cit> , including heterochrony in the timing of cell divisions, and restrictions in cell-cell interaction due to different placement of blastomeres in the developing embryo. from these observations it might be assumed that all nematodes follow a c. elegans-like pattern of development. however, deviations from the c. elegans pattern observed in other rhabditid nematodes show that the strictly determined mode of development is subject to evolutionary change, making it particularly attractive for the study of underpinning regulatory logic of developmental mechanisms. indeed, a greater role for regulative interactions in early development has been demonstrated in another rhabditid, acrobeloides nanus   <cit> .

regulative development is common among metazoa, and is also observed in other ecdysozoa, including arthropoda. indeed, in several enoplean species, early embryos have been found to not display polarised early divisions, arguing against a strongly determined mode of development in this group  <cit> . the determined mode found in c. elegans is thus likely to be derived even within nematoda  <cit> , implying that the core developmental system in nematoda has changed, while maintaining a very similar organismal output. this phenomenon, termed “developmental system drift”  <cit> , reveals independent selection on the developmental mechanism and the final form produced.

to explore the genetics of development of enoplean and other non-rhabditid nematodes requires tractable experimental systems with a suitable set of methodological tools and extensive genomic data. while c. elegans and its embryos are relatively easily manipulated and observed, and the c. elegans genome has been fully sequenced  <cit> , embryos from the enoplia and dorylaimia are much harder to culture and manipulate. few viable laboratory cultures exist and obtaining large numbers of embryos from wild material is difficult. functional molecular analysis of most nematodes, in particular enoplea, is further hindered by the lack of genetic tools such as mutant analysis or gene-knockdown via rnai. performing detailed comparative experimental embryology on a phylogenetically representative set of species across the phylum nematoda thus remains a distant goal.

the genetic toolkit utilised by a species is represented in its genome, and direct assessment of the genetic capabilities of an organism can thus be assessed through analysis of genome data. using the background knowledge of pathways and modules used in other taxa, the underpinning logic of a species’ developmental system can be inferred from its genome, and the developmental toolkits of different species can be compared. these comparisons can reveal changes in developmental logic between taxa by identifying gene losses during evolution that must result in changed pathway functioning, and similarly identify genes recruited to developmental regulatory roles in particular lineages.

efficient generation of genomic resources for non-model species, and the inference of developmental regulatory pathways from the encoded gene sets, is now possible. the majority of the fifteen nematode genomes published to date have been from rhabditida   <cit> . the single enoplean genome sequences is from the mammalian parasite trichinella spiralis   <cit> . t. spiralis is ovoviviparous, proper development requires intrauterine environment, and early blastomeres are extremely transparent  <cit>  such that individual nuclei are hard to identify . hence, this species is of very limited value for light microscopical image analysis and experimental investigation correlating cell dynamics with the molecular circuitry regulating early development.

although the genomes of many additional nematode species are being sequenced  <cit> , even in this wider sampling of the phylum, enoplea remains neglected. the enoplean romanomermis culicivorax  has been established in culture for decades. it infects and kills the larvae of many different mosquito species  <cit> , and is being investigated for its potential as a biocontrol agent of malaria and other disease vectors  <cit> . r. culicivorax and t. spiralis differ fundamentally in many life-cycle and phenotypic characters. r. culicivorax reproduces sexually. a single female can produce more than a thousand eggs, and embryos are easily studied under laboratory conditions. they display a developmental pattern that differs markedly from c. elegans. as in other enoplea  <cit>  the first division is equal, and not asymmetric as in c. elegans. r. culicivorax also shows an inversion of dorso-ventral axis polarity compared to c. elegans, while a predominantly monoclonal fate distribution indicates fewer modifying inductions between blastomeres  <cit> . generation of the hypodermis involves repetitive cell elements extending from posterior to anterior over the remainder of the embryo, a process distinct from that observed in c. elegans <cit> .

we here catalogue the r. culicivorax developmental toolkit derived from annotation of a draft genome sequence. we contrast genes and proteins identified in r. culicivorax and t. spiralis with those of c. elegans, and other ecdysozoa, represented by the arthropod tribolium castaneum. we conclude that major changes in the regulatory logic of development have taken place during nematode evolution, possibly as a consequence of developmental system drift, and that the model species c. elegans is considerably derived compared to an ecdysozoan  ground system. however, we are still able to define conserved gene sets that may act in “phylotypic” developmental stages.

RESULTS
romanomermis culicivorax has a large and repetitive genome
a draft genome assembly for r. culicivorax was generated from  <dig>  gigabases  of raw data . the assembly has a contig span of  <dig> million base pairs  and a scaffold span of  <dig> mb. the  <dig> mb of spanned gaps are likely inflated estimates derived from use of the sspace scaffolder. we do not currently have a validated independent estimate of genome size for r. culicivorax, but preliminary measurements with feulgen densitometry suggest a size greater than  <dig> mb . the r. culicivorax genome is thus three times bigger than that of c. elegans, and five times that of t. spiralis . the assembly is currently in  <dig>  scaffolds and contigs larger than  <dig> bp, with an n <dig> of  <dig>  kilobases . the n <dig> for scaffolds larger than  <dig> kb is  <dig>  kb, and the largest scaffold is over  <dig> kb. the gc content is 36%, comparable to 38% of c. elegans and 34% in t. spiralis. we identified 47% of the r. culicivorax genome as repetitive. to validate this estimate we applied our repeat-finding approach to previously published genomes and achieved good accordance with these data . the non-repetitive content of the r. culicivorax genome is thus approximately twice that of c. elegans and three times that of t. spiralis. t. spiralis thus stands out as having the least complex nematode genome sequenced so far, and the contrast with r. culicivorax indicates that small genomes are not characteristic of dorylaimia.

we generated  <dig> sequencing transcriptome data from mixed adults, and assembled  <dig>  isotigs in  <dig>  isogroups, spanning  <dig> mb. these are likely to be a reasonable estimate of the r. culicivorax transcriptome. using blat  <cit> ,  <dig>  of the isotigs were found to be present  in single contigs or scaffolds of the genome assembly, suggesting reasonable biological completeness and contiguity of the genome. we also used the cegma  <cit>  approach to assess quality of the genome assembly, and found a high representation  and a low proportion of duplicates  . automated gene prediction with iterative rounds of the maker pipeline  <cit> , using the transcriptome data as evidence both directly and through genomethreader-derived mapping, yielded a total of nearly  <dig>  gene models. these were reduced to  <dig>  by merging those with identities >99% using cd-hit  <cit> . within the  <dig>  models,  <dig>  were derived from the augustus modeller  <cit>  and  <dig>  from snap. because augustus predictions conservatively require some external evidence , we regarded these as the most reliable and biologically complete. in comparison c. elegans has ∼ <dig>  genes, and t. spiralis has ∼ <dig> . the satellite model nematode pristionchus pacificus has ∼ <dig>  genes  <cit> . exons of the augustus-predicted genes in r. culicivorax had a median length of  <dig> bp, slightly larger than those in c. elegans  and t. spiralis . introns of the r. culicivorax augustus models, with a median of  <dig> bp, were much larger than those of c. elegans  or t. spiralis . the small introns observed in c. elegans and other rhabditid nematodes  are thus likely to be a derived feature.

we annotated  <dig>  trnas in the r. culicivorax genome using infernal  <cit>  and trnascan-se  <cit> , of which  <dig> were pseudogenes . in comparison, t. spiralis has  <dig> trnas of which  <dig> are pseudogenes, while c. elegans has  <dig> trnas with  <dig> pseudogenes  <cit> . threonine  trnas were particularly overrepresented , a finding echoed in the genomes of meloidogyne incognita and meloidogyne floridensis <cit>  and in p. pacificus <cit> . the latter has also an overrepresentation of arginine trnas  <cit> .

we have made available the annotated r. culicivorax genome, with functional categorisations of predicted genes and proteins and annotation features, in a dedicated genome browser at http://romanomermis.nematod.es.

the r.culicivorax gene set is more representative of dorylaimia than t. spiralis
the phylogenetic placement of r. culicivorax makes its genome attractive for exploring the likely genetic complexity of an ancestral nematode. with t. spiralis, it can be used to reveal the idiosyncrasies of the several genomes available for rhabditida. to polarise this comparison, we used the arthropod tribolium castaneum, for which a high quality genome sequence is available  <cit> . t. castaneum development is considered less derived than that of the major arthropod model drosophila melanogaster <cit> . the orthomcl pipeline accurately clusters orthologous proteins, facilitating the complex task of grouping proteins that are likely to share biological function in divergent organisms  <cit> , and performs better than approaches that simply use domain presence information or aggregative approaches such as psiblast  <cit> . we used the orthomcl pipeline to generate a set of protein clusters for the four species . while the large divergence between these species may obscure relationships between protein sequences, making inference of orthology problematic  <cit> , the parameters used were most inclusive  <cit> . additionally, as the r. culicivorax genome assembly may not be complete we based inference of absence on shared loss in both r. culicivorax and t. spiralis. additionally, we validated inferences of absence from the orthomcl analyses by performing detailed sequence comparisons using blast+  <cit>  .

we identified  <dig>  clusters that contained protein representatives from all three nematodes, and  <dig>  of these also contained at least one t. castaneum representative . these  <dig>  clusters represent a conserved ecdysozoan  core proteome. many clusters had t. castaneum members, and members from some but not all of the three nematodes, representing candidate examples of loss in one or more nematode lineages of ancient proteins. for example, we identified clusters containing proteins from only one of the nematode species. t. spiralis had the lowest number of these , while c. elegans and r. culicivorax each had over two thousand. interestingly, of the  <dig>  clusters with only r. culicivorax proteins from nematoda,  <dig> included t. castaneum orthologues, wheras c. elegans only shared  <dig> clusters uniquely with the beetle. t. spiralis has lost more of these phylogenetically ancient genes than has either r. culicivorax or c. elegans. t. spiralis and c. elegans shared only  <dig> clusters exclusive of r. culicivorax members, while r. culicivorax and c. elegans shared about  <dig> clusters exclusive of t. spiralis. despite their phylogenetic affinity, r. culicivorax and t. spiralis only shared  <dig> clusters exclusive of c. elegans . we suggest that t. spiralis genome is not typical of dorylaims. in comparison to other nematodes it is smaller, has fewer genes overall, and has fewer phylogenetically ancient genes. this is congruent with the previously reported loss of proteins with metabolic function in t. spiralis <cit> . this reduction in genetic complexity could be due to evolutionary pressures following acquisition of a lifestyle that lacks a free-living stage. many parasitic and endosymbiotic prokaryotes and eukaryotes have reduced genome sizes, though this is not an absolute rule  <cit> .

clusters containing only r. culicivorax and t. spiralis proteins might identify functions distinct to these dorylaim nematodes. in the  <dig> t. spiralis and  <dig> r. culicivorax proteins in these clusters, a total of  <dig> go terms were found to be overrepresented . while c. elegans has a reduced ability to methylate dna  <cit> , we found four methylation-associated go terms among the  <dig> overrepresented. we also detected significant enrichment  for go terms describing chromatin and dna methylation functions in the set of r. culicivorax proteins that lacked homologues in c. elegans . important roles for methylation and changes in methylation patterns during t. spiralis development have been inferred from transcriptional profiling  <cit> . methylation is important for the silencing of transposable elements  <cit>  and could play a crucial role in the highly repetitive r. culicivorax genome.

the clusters that contained r. culicivorax, t. spiralis and t. castaneum proteins but no c. elegans orthologues might contain proteins involved in core ecdysozoan processes lost in c. elegans. in these clusters we identified  <dig> go terms overrepresented  compared to the c. elegans proteome . some of these go terms were linked to chromatin remodelling and methylation . other overrepresented go terms were related to cell signalling , and ecdysone receptor holocomplex .

the genetic background of development in r. culicivorax and t. spiralis differs markedly from that of c. elegans
in a recent multi-species developmental time course expression analysis within several caenorhabditis species, conserved sets of genes were found to have conserved patterns of differential expression in discrete phases in the timeline from zygote to the hatching larva  <cit> .

nearly half  of these  <dig> conserved, differentially expressed c. elegans proteins were not clustered with r. culicivorax or t. spiralis proteins using orthomcl. we were unable to identify any sequence similarity for  <dig> of these c. elegans proteins, while  <dig> had only marginal similarities insufficent for orthomcl clustering. eighteen of these  <dig> are members of c. elegans nuclear hormone receptor subfamilies,  <dig> are innexin type gap-junction proteins,  <dig> are twik potassium channel proteins and  <dig> are acetylcholine receptor proteins. these protein families are particularly diverse and expanded in c. elegans <cit>  and we suggest that they represent rapidly evolved, divergent duplications within the lineage leading to c. elegans. the proportion of caenorhabditis-restricted genes across the developmental time course examined by levin et al.  <cit>  varied from 36% to 60% . thus a surprisingly high proportion of caenorhabditis genes with conserved expression during embryogenesis appear to be unique to the genus or are so divergent that we could not detect possible orthologues in the dorylaims. the pattern of higher retention of conserved genes in r. culicivorax compared to t. spiralis was also evident in these conserved-expression developmental genes, as  <dig> had r. culicivorax orthologues but lacked a t. spiralis orthologues. given the conservatism of body plan evolution in nematodes, these dramatic genetic differences suggest extensive, largely phenotypically “silent” changes in the genetic programmes orchestrating nematode development.

core developmental pathways differ between nematodes
there are important differences in cell behaviour during early embryogenesis between r. culicivorax and c. elegans <cit> . we used the genomic data to follow up on some of the striking contrasts between the dorylaim and the rhabditid patterns of development: establishment of primary axis polarity, segregation of maternal message within the early embryo, hypodermis formation, the vulval specification pathways, epigenetic pathways , sex determination and light sensing .

the mechanisms of sex determination differ considerably among animals and it has been claimed to be one of the developmental programs most influenced by developmental system drift  <cit> . divergence in sex determination pathways is thus not unexpected. while sex is determined by x to autosome ratio in c. elegans <cit> , sex ratios in r. culicivorax are likely to be environmentally determined through in-host nematode density  <cit> . environmental sex determination is found in many nematode taxa, including strongyloididae and meloidogyninae , taxa more closely related to c. elegans. in c. elegans, the x to autosome ratio is read by the master switch xol- <dig>  <cit> , which acts through the three sdc genes  <cit>  to regulate the secretion of her- <dig>  a ligand for the tra- <dig> receptor  <cit> . tra- <dig> in turn negatively regulates a complex of fem genes, which regulates nuclear translocation of tra- <dig>  the final shared step in the pathway that switches between male and hermaphrodite systems. no credible homologues of xol- <dig>  sdc- <dig>  sdc- <dig>  sdc- <dig>  her- <dig> or tra- <dig> in either t. spiralis or r. culicivorax were detected through orthomcl and re-confirmation with blast+ , and thus these species are unlikely to use the her- <dig> – tra- <dig> ligand-receptor system to coordinate sexual differentiation.

other developmental processes are however more conserved between metazoan taxa. in c. elegans and many other animals par genes are essential for cell polarisation  <cit> . polarised distribution of par proteins results in the restriction of mitotic spindle rotation to the germline cell in the c. elegans two-cell stage  <cit> . this rotation is not observed in r. culicivorax <cit> . the division pattern of c. elegans mutants lacking par- <dig> and par- <dig> genes resembles that of the early r. culicivorax embryo  <cit> . the par- <dig> gene was absent from both r. culicivorax and t. spiralis . additionally, no orthologues for the par-2-interacting genes let- <dig>  gpr- <dig> or gpr- <dig>  required for proper embryonic spindle orientation in c. elegans <cit> , were identified in the dorylaims using orthomcl clustering or sensitive blast+ searches. although we identified a protein with weak similarity to par- <dig> in r. culicivorax, this was so divergent from c. elegans, t. castaneum and t. spiralispar- <dig> that it was not clustered in our analysis. in d. melanogaster a par- <dig> orthologue, bazooka, functions in anterior-posterior axis formation  <cit> , but par- <dig> is absent from the fly. thus, we hypothesise that the par-3/par- <dig> system for regulating spindle positioning evolved within the lineage leading to the genus caenorhabditis. if the divergent par-3-like gene in r. culicivorax is involved in axis formation, it probably interacts with different partner proteins.

once polarity has been established in the early c. elegans embryo, many maternal messages are differentially segregated into anterior or posterior blastomeres  <cit> . mex- <dig> is an rna-binding protein translated from maternally-provisioned mrnas found predominantly in early anterior blastomeres  <cit> . we identified a highly divergent mex- <dig> orthologue in r. culicivorax, but no orthologue in t. spiralis. we explored embryonic expression of mex- <dig> in r. culicivorax embryos using in situ hybridisation . in the fertilized egg the mex- <dig> mrna is initially equally distributed. prior to first cleavage it is segregated to the anterior pole and thus becomes essentially restricted to the somatic s <dig> blastomere . with the division of s <dig> it is localized to both daughter cells. after the 4-cell stage the signal disappears gradually. this expression pattern is similar to that of c. elegansmex- <dig>  affirming that the r. culicivorax gene is likely to be an orthologue retaining similar functions. however, despite the presence, and apparent conservation of the mex- <dig> expression pattern, we were unable to identify other interacting partners of the c. elegans mex- <dig> protein, such as mex- <dig>  mex- <dig> and spn- <dig> in either dorylaim species. while mex- <dig> and mex- <dig> are important for controlled mex- <dig> expression in c. elegans <cit> , the apparent absence of spn- <dig> in r. culicivorax and t. spiralis is particularly intriguing. spn- <dig> links embryonic polarity conferred by the par genes and partners to cell fate specification through maternally deposited mrnas and proteins  <cit> . our findings suggest that the core regulatory logic of the early control of axis formation and cell fate specification must differ significantly between the dorylaim species and c. elegans.

the hypodermis in c. elegans is derived from specific descendants of the anterior and posterior founder cells  <cit> . in contrast, in r. culicivorax hypodermis is derived from descendants of a single cell  <cit> . several c. elegans genes expressed in the hypodermis or associated with hypodermal development were absent from r. culicivorax and t. spiralis . for example the gata-like transcription factors elt- <dig> and elt- <dig> act redundantly in c. elegans <cit> . elt- <dig> was absent from the dorylaim species, but elt- <dig> was conserved in r. culicivorax, t. spiralis and t. castaneum. thus, elt- <dig> appears to be an innovation in the rhabditid lineage, suggesting changes of interaction complexity during nematode evolution.

in c. elegans, vulva formation is highly dependent on initial inductive signals from the anchor cell that activate a complex gene regulatory network, which drives tissue specific cell division and differentiation. the evolutionary plasticity of this system has been explored in rhabditid nematodes, revealing the changing relative importance of cell-cell interactions, inductions, and lineage-autonomous specifications  <cit> . the signal transduction pathways include a rtk/ras/mapk cascade, activated by egf- and wnt-signalling  <cit> . among the downstream targets in c. elegans are for example lin- <dig> and the β-catenin bar- <dig>  which in turn regulates the hox- <dig> orthologue lin- <dig>  <cit> . these important regulators of vulva development are completely absent from the genomes of r. culicivorax and t. spiralis . we identified a r. culicivorax protein with low similarity to c. elegans bar- <dig> . however, this protein is not clustered with other dorylaim proteins, and appears to be either a duplication of the β-catenin ortholog hmp- <dig> or another armadillo repeat-containing protein rather than an orthologue of bar- <dig> . these shared patterns of absence again suggest that similar morphological structures can be generated with very different genetic underpinnings. vulva formation in the dorylaims may be regulated without the bar- <dig> – lin- <dig> interaction, as observed in p. pacificus <cit> . in c. elegans hox gene expression is cell-lineage dependent  <cit> , organised so that the cells that express specific hox genes are clustered along the anterior-posterior axis . it will be informative to test whether in r. culicivorax and other non-rhabditid nematodes hox genes act in an axis position-dependent, but cell lineage-independent manner, as observed in many other animals, notably arthropods  <cit> . epigenetic regulation is key to developmental processes in many animals, but its roles in c. elegans are more muted . notably c. elegans is depleted for chromatin re-modelling genes of the polycomb and trithorax groups  <cit> . it is intriguing that we found orthologues of t. castaneumpleiohomeotic in r. culicivorax and t. spiralis, and orthologs of t. castaneumtrithorax and sex comb on midleg  in r. culicivorax. this suggests that dorylaim chromatin restructuring mechanisms may be more arthropod-like than in c. elegans. the presence of an intact methylation machinery and conserved chromatin re-modelling factors opens the prospects for a role for epigenetic modification in developmental regulation of dorylaim nematodes.

defining a set of potential phylotypic stage genes
while the examples above demonstrate considerable developmental system drift in nematoda, we also identified many sets of orthologous proteins conserved between dorylaimia and c. elegans. we asked if these could be correlated with functions in distinct developmental phases with a conserved phenotype. shortly before the start of morphogenesis, at the point of ventral enclosure, nematode embryos from chromadorea and enoplea share a similar morphology  <cit> . levin et al.  <cit>  found that in five caenorhabditis species a distinct set of genes had elevated expression around the ventral enclosure stage   and proposed that this constitutes a “phylotypic stage" for nematodes. we used t. spiralis and r. culicivorax gene sets to refine and restrict this set of phylotypic stage genes. of the  <dig> c. elegans genes with elevated expression between stages  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> had no orthologue in r. culicivorax, t. spiralis or t. castaneum. the remaining  <dig> phylotypic stage candidates from c. elegans were present in  <dig> of our orthomcl clusters. of these clusters  <dig> were nematode-restricted containing  <dig> c. elegans proteins grouped with  <dig> r. culicivorax and  <dig> t. spiralis homologues. the remaining  <dig> clusters were part of the conserved ecdysozoan core proteome  and contained  <dig> c. elegans proteins together with  <dig> r. culicivorax,  <dig> t. spiralis and  <dig> t. castaneum proteins . in the set of phylotypic stage genes identified by levin et al.  <cit>  are proteins functioning in processes such as muscle and neuron formation, signalling between cells, and morphogenesis. this pattern was retained in the conserved clusters . although time-resolved expression data will be needed to confirm the activity of these genes in developmental stages of r. culicivorax, their retention in the dorylaimia supports their general importance. we can now sub-classify the set of conserved proteins expressed at the potential nematode phylotypic stage. a first, nematode-restricted set includes many proteins that are important for cuticle formation  and some hedgehog-like proteins, expressed in the c. elegans hypodermis  <cit> . as cuticle formation follows ventral enclosure in nematodes, these proteins may be involved in this nematode-specific function. the second set, comprising clusters conserved between the nematodes and t. castaneum, contains many important developmental transcription factors, such as the hox gene mab- <dig>  other homeobox genes, and helix-loop-helix and c2h2-type zinc finger transcription factors. this second set may represent a genetic backbone driving formation of phylotypic stage in diverse animal taxa, in accordance with the recent extension of the concept to metazoa  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
to be useful as a contrasting system to the canonical c. elegans model, any nematode species must be accessible to both descriptive and manipulative investigation. the reference genome for r. culicivorax lays bare the core machinery available for developmental regulation, and we have demonstrated that in situ hybridisation approaches are feasible for this species. along with the long established, robust laboratory cultures, this makes r. culicivorax an attractive and tractable alternative model for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of nematode development. by combining the r. culicivorax genome with that of t. spiralis, we have been able to explore the molecular diversity of dorylaimia, and provide robust contrasts with the intensively studied rhabditida. particularly surprising are the differences between r. culicivorax and t. spiralis. the r. culicivorax genome is much larger than that of t. spiralis, and contained a high proportion of repetitive sequence, including many transposable elements. despite the phylogenetic and lifestyle affinities between the two dorylaims compared to c. elegans, the r. culicivorax genome retained many more genes in common with c. elegans than did t. spiralis. we suggest that t. spiralis may be an atypical representative of dorylaim nematodes, perhaps due to its highly derived life cycle.

our analyses identified many genes apparently absent from the dorylaim genomes, despite relaxed analysis parameters. in particular, for genes identified as critical to c. elegans development but apparently absent from the dorylaims, we were unable to identify credible orthologues using sensitive search strategies. in this phylum-spanning comparison, inferences of gene orthology can be obscured by levels of divergence. in addition, the gene family birth rate in the chromadorean lineage leading to c. elegans is high  <cit> , and therefore c. elegans was expected to have many genes absent from the dorylaim species. thus, we might not have found a r. culicivorax orthologue for a specific gene for three reasons: it may have arisen in the branch leading to c. elegans; its sequence divergence may be too great to permit clustering with potential homologs; or it was not assembled in the draft dorylaim genomes. the case of c. elegans par- <dig> and d. melanogasterbazooka illustrate some of these difficulties: the possible r. culicivorax orthologue was highly divergent. whether or not we have been able to identify all the orthologues of the key c. elegans genes present in the r. culicivorax and t. spiralis genomes, the absence of an identified orthologue maximally implies loss from the genome, and minimally implies significant sequence divergence. in the latter case this would most likely cause changes in the networks and pathways in which genes interact to deliver biological function.

between the model nematode c. elegans and arthropod models such as t. castaneum many key mechanisms governing early cell patterning are divergent  <cit> . our data strongly support the view that major variation also exists within nematoda. t. spiralis and r. culicivorax both lack orthologues of genes involved in core developmental processes in c. elegans, and many of these c. elegans genes appear to be restricted to the rhabditida. it is thus doubtful that these processes are regulated by same molecular interactions across the phylum. we suggest that developmental system drift has played a major role in nematode evolution. the phenotypic conservatism associated with the vermiform morphology of nematodes  <cit>  has fostered unjustified expectations concerning the conservation of genetic programmes that determine these morphologies. despite this divergence in developmental systems, we were able to define two sets of conserved genes possibly active in a taxon-specific phase of ventral enclosure and cuticle formation in nematoda, and in a potential phylotypic stage of ecdysozoa. the advent of robust, affordable and rapid genome sequencing also opens the vista of large-scale comparative genomics of development across the phylum nematoda  <cit>  to better understand the diversity of the phylum and also place the remarkable c. elegans model in context of its peers. it will next be necessary to extend these studies to a broader sampling of developmental pathway genes from a wider and representative sampling of nematode genomes across the full diversity of the phylum. we have highlighted a few of the possible avenues a research programme could follow: early axis formation and polarisation, the specification of hypodermis, sex determination, vulva formation, the roles of epigenetic processes in developmental regulation and the confirmation of potential “phylotypic stage genes” with expression analysis in r. culicivorax.
