BACKGROUND
chemical signals detected by the olfactory system can alter the reproductive state and sexual behavior of female mice. pheromones emitted by male conspecifics elicit rapid responses in females’ behavior - such as lordosis  <cit> , or sexual attraction to males  <cit>  - that facilitate sexual contact. such cues also produce long-lasting effects on endocrine physiology, including estrus-inducing events that improve the likelihood of fecundation  <cit> . within the different olfactory subsystems  <cit> , the vomeronasal organ  appears to be critical for the display of female reproductive behaviors. surgical lesions of the vno eliminate important olfactory-dependent neuroendocrine functions in female mice, including mate recognition and pregnancy block, facilitation of lordosis, puberty acceleration, and induction of estrus  <cit> . furthermore, genetic inactivation of the transient receptor potential channel trpc <dig>  the primary sensory ion channel of the vno  <cit> , results in a number of alterations in female reproductive behaviors, such as the absence of puberty acceleration, maternal aggression, and lordosis, and an increase in male-like sex behaviors  <cit> . however, experiments using either surgical vno removal  <cit>  or deletion of trpc <dig>  <cit>  led to a number of phenotypic discrepancies including unusual mounting levels toward males, and ultrasonic vocalizations and sex behavior toward females. moreover, at least a portion of basal vomeronasal sensory neurons  in trpc2-/- mice seem to retain some level of sensory responsiveness  <cit> , possibly because of parallel signal amplification mechanisms  <cit> , which makes trpc2-/- mice a much more complicated model to examine vno-mediated function and behavior than previously anticipated.

the murine vno sensory epithelium is segregated into at least two anatomically and molecularly distinct layers: apical vsns express the g-protein gαi <dig> and the v1r family of vomeronasal receptors, whereas basal vsns express gαo and members of the v2r receptor family  <cit> . the roles that these two vno subsystems play in the control of innate, female-specific reproductive and sexual behaviors are largely unclear. projections of these two vsn populations remain segregated at the level of the accessory olfactory bulb , and overlap only in more central brain areas, supporting both the possibility of divergent functions as well as synergy between the two subsystems. several social and reproductive behaviors, such as aggression, puberty acceleration, and female attraction to males, have been suggested to be mediated by the basal vno subsystem in some studies  <cit> , and by the apical vno in others  <cit> . to dissect vno function in controlling female reproductive and neuroendocrine status, we have developed a mutant mouse strain harboring a conditional, olfactory marker protein  and cre-mediated ablation of gαo  <cit> . cell-specific and time-dependent ablation of gαo prevents these animals from detecting peptide and protein ligands by vsns, leading to severe alterations in some social behaviors such as male-male and maternal aggression  <cit> . to fully understand the consequences of this conditional gαo deletion, we undertook a considerably more comprehensive behavioral analysis of these mice and focused on the role of the basal gαo vomeronasal subsystem in pheromone-stimulated sexual and reproductive behaviors of female mice. our findings revealed that gαo impacts on a much wider range of such behaviors than previously recognized, thus highlighting the importance of gαo and the cells that express it in the control of pheromone-dependent sexual behaviors in female mice.

RESULTS
delayed puberty onset and defective puberty acceleration
a strategy to maximize reproductive success is the induction of estrus in females by their male partners. in juvenile female mice the entry into puberty is advanced after exposure to male urine, a phenomenon known as puberty acceleration or the vandenbergh effect  <cit> . puberty acceleration is strongly dependent on a functional vno  <cit> , and does not require an intact main olfactory epithelium   <cit> . the pheromonal cues responsible for this effect have not been characterized with certainty, but small organic molecules have been proposed to have puberty-accelerating effects  <cit> . some of these compounds are ligands that activate apical v1r/gαi2-expressing vsns  <cit> . other studies implicate that major urinary proteins , which are known to activate basal v2r/gαo vsns  <cit> , or mup-derived peptides accelerate puberty or contain ovulatory activity  <cit> . however, the effects of many of these molecules were difficult to reproduce by others  <cit> . it came as a surprise when we found that puberty acceleration - measured as stimulus-evoked uterine weight increase - was drastically reduced in the conditional, omp/cre gαo-mutant  female mice versus heterozygous  and c57bl/ <dig>  controls . we observed that stimulation with male urine failed to induce a significant increase in uterine to body mass ratio in cgαo-/- females : p =  <dig> ) whereas b <dig> and cgαo+/- control females exhibited a substantial gain after urine exposure  . these results indicate that female puberty acceleration by cues present in male urine is severely reduced or absent in the mutant mice and that intact gαo function is necessary to mediate pheromonal responses that increase uterine mass.

previous studies showed that surgical vno lesions also delayed the onset of puberty on grouped prepubertal females not exposed to male odors  <cit> . therefore, we further characterized female juvenile mice to determine whether insensitivity to puberty accelerating cues is accompanied by a delay in puberty. control b <dig>  cgαo+/-, and cgαo-/- females were examined for vaginal opening and first estrus. vaginal opening was significantly delayed, by three to four days, in cgαo-/- females compared with b <dig> and cgαo+/- : f <dig>  =  <dig> , p < <dig> ; lsd: p < <dig>  , p < <dig>  ; figure 1c,d). similarly, the first estrus was also significantly delayed by approximately six days in cgαo-/-versus b <dig> females , p < <dig>  ; figure 1d). no significant differences were found between b <dig> and cgαo+/- controls . thus, cgαo-/- females displayed a delay in puberty that could not be altered by exposure to puberty-accelerating pheromones present in male urine.

altered estrus induction and estrous cycles
to further explore gαo-mediated effects on female reproductive fitness, we investigated the impact of chemosensory cues on the timing of behavioral estrus and ovulation in adult females. in this process, known as the whitten effect  <cit> , ovulation can be promoted in a group of adult female mice following exposure to urinary cues from adult males. to determine whether gαo signaling is required for estrus induction, we analyzed the frequency and duration of the estrous cycles of group-housed cgαo-/- mice before and after male urine exposure. we monitored the estrous cycles of cgαo-/- mice and three different control strains: heterozygous cgαo+/-, ‘floxed’ gαo mutants lacking cre-recombinase , and b <dig> females. each group was monitored during a four-week interval, in which we exposed the animals to adult male urine during the last two weeks . b <dig>  cgαo+/-, and gαofx/fx control mice displayed regular and consistent estrous cycles before and after exposure to male urine . however, cgαo-/- females exhibited irregular cycles with a decreased number of receptive days  . after exposure to male urine, estrous cycles of b <dig>  cgαo+/-, and gαofx/fx mice showed a significant increase in cycle frequency , < <dig>  , < <dig>  ; figure 2b) and in the number of receptive days  . by contrast, estrous cycles of cgαo-/- females following male urine exposure did not increase in cycle frequency  or receptive days . interestingly, gαo ablation also seemed to cause a reduction of days in estrus and proestrus even without urine stimulation . exposure to male urine also resulted in a significant cycle acceleration of nearly two days after three estrous cycles monitored in b <dig> females , p < <dig>  , p < <dig>  ), whereas there was no significant change in estrous cycle onset in cgαo-/- females after the male urine two-week stimulation . cgαo-/- females showed lower cycle frequency rate  and number of receptive days  after male urine exposure , suggesting that sensory input to male cues may not be completely abolished in these mice. taken together, these findings revealed that gαo is a necessary requirement in female mice for the display of sexual receptivity, reproductive status, and physiological changes promoted by male urinary pheromones.

reproductive performance and sex hormone levels
our finding that cgαo-/- mice had fewer days in estrus and proestrus and less-regular estrous cycles was not caused by a general disruption of reproductive capacity in these mice. we compared several fertility parameters in b <dig>  gαofx/fx controls, and cgαo-/- mice in continuous mating conditions over four months. cgαo-/-, gαofx/fx, and b <dig> females did not differ in litter size, average number of litters, litter interval, relative fecundity, or latency to first litter . consistent with these results, no obvious changes in ovary morphology were observed in cgαo-/- females . follicle size  as well as the presence of corpus luteum in both genotypes revealed no differences in morphology and number . furthermore, there was no significant difference in the levels of circulating estradiol at proestrus stage in both juvenile  and adult  females and progesterone in adults , thus confirming that impaired behavioral and physiological responses in cgαo-/- females did not result from an indirect effect of the mutation at the level of the ovaries.

bruce effect
we examined the bruce effect, a form of olfactory imprinting that leads to pregnancy failure and depends on the formation and maintenance of a pheromonal recognition memory. in this process, recently mated female mice experience high pregnancy failure rates and return to estrus when exposed to unfamiliar male odors during a three- to four-day critical period of embryo implantation  <cit> . this pregnancy block requires an intact vno  <cit> . the low molecular weight fractions of unfamiliar urine  <cit>  and major histocompatibility complex  peptides of disparate mhc haplotypes  <cit>  can induce the bruce effect. given that gαo is essential for sensing of mhc peptides by vsns  <cit> , we asked whether pregnancy can still be terminated by unfamiliar urinary cues in cgαo-/- mice. females were exposed to urine from unfamiliar  males after a short  <dig> h mating period with b <dig>  males. the b <dig> females performed as expected: high pregnancy rates were observed when no further stimuli were applied  or when the mice were exposed to familiar b <dig> urine, and exposure to unfamiliar urine induced a low pregnancy rate  in b <dig> . by contrast, cgαo-/- females already showed near-maximum non-pregnancy rates under unstimulated conditions or after exposure to familiar urine, and stimulation with unfamiliar urine did not further increase these high failure rates .

defective lordosis behavior
we investigated pheromone-dependent, sexually receptive behaviors in b <dig> versus cgαo-/- females . in cgαo-/- females that were exposed to a sexually experienced control b <dig> male, we quantified lordosis, a female sexual stance in response to male mounting that denotes sexual receptivity and allows for successful copulation. lordosis requires intact vno-aob function  <cit> , and activation of the vomeronasal vmn2r <dig> receptor by exocrine-gland-secreted peptide esp <dig> enhances lordosis in mice  <cit> . given that females deficient for vmn2r <dig> show a striking deficit in lordosis  <cit>  and that esp <dig> detection is severely reduced in vsns lacking gαo  <cit> , the display of lordosis should also be affected in cgαo-/- females. females were exposed to males from two different strains . these strains differ on the expression of esp1: b <dig> males do not secrete esp <dig> whereas balb/c males do  <cit> . in both cases, we found a dramatic  reduction in lordosis quotient  in cgαo-/- mice versus b <dig>  cgαo+/-, and gαofx/fx controls ; anova: f <dig>  =  <dig> ; lsd: p < <dig>   ). b <dig>  gαofx/fx, and cgαo+/- controls did not differ statistically . we also observed a strongly reduced number of females showing lordosis  in cgαo-/- mice versus b <dig>  cgαo+/-, and gαofx/fx controls . the overall latency of cgαo-/- females to be mounted by males in the lordosis assay was similar in all cases . thus, gαo played a critical role in the display of sexual receptivity and the detection of lordosis-enhancing pheromones by female mice.

no display of male-typical mating behaviors in gαo-mutant females
lack of receptivity to males could be a consequence of defective gender discrimination. some studies have argued that an intact main olfactory system, but not vno, is required for gender discrimination given that mice after surgical removal of the vno or aob are still able to distinguish between male and female urinary volatiles  <cit> . other investigations concluded that it is the vno that mediates sex discrimination  <cit> . in these latter experiments, trpc2-/- mice of both sexes displayed an increase in mounting behavior toward any conspecific regardless of the gender, and a reduction in female-typical behaviors such as maternal aggression and nesting  <cit> . it is unclear whether these alterations in behavior are a consequence of the existence of vno-dependent neural circuits underlying gender-specific behaviors  <cit>  or, alternatively, whether those behaviors are caused by hormonal changes  <cit> . in addition, ablation of gαo in female mice results in defective maternal aggression  <cit> . these findings prompted us to test whether conditional gαo deletion has a crucial effect on gender recognition and sex-specific behaviors . we quantified mounting behavior of cgαo-/- female residents to either male, female, or castrated male intruders that were independently introduced into the resident’s home cage during a  <dig> min test period. none of the cgαo-/- females tested exhibited mounting to any of the intruders, although some low levels of mounting  were observed in 10% to 30% of the control b <dig> females, especially to female and castrated intruders . other types of male-typical behaviors such as territorial aggression, quantified as the number of aggressive animals or attack duration, remained low in both cgαo-/- and b <dig> control female mice . to test whether the lack of mounting in the cgαo-/- mice was a consequence of reduced social interaction with the intruder, we measured sniffing times of the resident females to the intruder . no significant difference in sniffing duration was found in cgαo-/- females versus b <dig> controls . thus, deletion of gαo did not enhance the display of male-specific behaviors in female mice. rather, there seems to be a repression of mounting in cgαo-/- females. to investigate whether repression of sexual behavior is a widespread condition in cgαo-/- animals, we measured mounting towards female mice in cgαo-/- males. we introduced an estrous female in the home cage of sexually naïve cgαo-/- male residents and found high levels of all measures of mounting, including mounting animals, number of mounts per animal, mounting duration, and latency to first mount, that were not significantly different from those of the b <dig> control males . thus, unlike trpc <dig> mutants, cgαo-/- males did not exhibit obvious deficits in male-female choice of sexual partner.

to further assess whether cgαo-/- mice are able to discriminate between odors of different genders, we performed a simultaneous odor choice test  for urinary odors in cgαo-/-versus b <dig> female mice. following odor presentation, both groups spent more time investigating intact male urine versus female urine , p < <dig>  ; figure 6f). this indicates that cgαo-/- females are capable of discriminating urinary odors of males versus females, presumably after their detection by the moe. therefore, both cgαo-/- males and females were able to discriminate gender cues present in urine and did not exhibit enhanced sexual-specific behaviors such as indiscriminate male and female mounting.

loss of attraction to familiar ownership signals
under natural conditions, sexual attraction to the scent of dominant males may provide females with benefits in terms of proper mate choice and pregnancy onset and maintenance  <cit> . the ability to detect dominant males requires females to discriminate between different potential mating partners and, subsequently, display a preference for one of them. female mice are attracted to and show a preference for airborne urinary volatiles from familiar individual males whose scent marks they have previously contacted physically relative to males whose scent is unfamiliar  <cit> . to determine whether this preference requires gαo-dependent vomeronasal chemoreception, during an identity-learning phase , female mice were presented with urine streaks from two unrelated b <dig> males, each singly housed . we placed urine from the first male on a filter paper allowing direct physical contact with the odor source whereas urine from the second male was deposited on filter paper that was placed in a meshed plastic box  <cit> , thus preventing direct physical contact. at this point, females showed no innate preference for any of the tested urine sources . in a subsequent recognition phase , the females were then given a choice between urine scents from the two males under conditions that precluded direct physical access to both urine sources. we measured overall investigation times during a  <dig> min test period, that is, the time spent in close proximity to the plastic box including pulling and gnawing at the box and attempting to access the stimulus. in b <dig> females, there was a three-fold preference for the urine they had previously encountered by physical contact . by contrast, this preference was absent in cgαo-/- female mice  and investigation times for both stimuli remained relatively low , indicating that experience with both volatile and nonvolatile components of male urine failed to induce familiar male preference and attraction.

to determine potential urinary ligands underlying this type of scent recognition by female mice, we repeated this test using fractionated male urine in order to separate larger mups from small molecules such as urinary peptides. behavioral analysis revealed that the mup-containing high molecular weight  fraction of male urine was able to induce a preference in control b <dig> females, whereas the low molecular weight fraction  showed no significant activity ; p < <dig>  ; figure 6c). the hmw-dependent activity was lost when tested on cgαo-/- females . mups present in hmw are nonvolatile proteins of around  <dig> kda in size and can only be detected when physical contact is allowed. however, mups fold into a β-barrel structure that binds small hydrophobic volatile molecules that are released into the air and can be detected without physical contact. competitive displacement of these ligands, by incubation of the hmw fraction with menadione  <cit> , blocks volatile release and virtually transforms the hmw fraction odorless if physical contact is inhibited. incubation of the hmw fraction with menadione prior to assaying for behavior prevented the formation of a preference for any of the urine sources in wild-type animals , indicating that associative learning of nonvolatile hmw fraction with volatiles is necessary to generate the preference.

collectively, these results indicate that gαo is required to develop a learned association with a nonvolatile ownership signal and that vomeronasal mup detection is likely to mediate this effect. to verify that such ownership recognition requires scents to be associated with nonvolatile identity signatures and to confirm that cgαo-/- mice were not anosmic, we evaluated their ability to discriminate volatile odors from two different males. using a habituation-dishabituation paradigm  <cit> , we found that both b <dig> and cgαo-/- females were able to discriminate urine volatiles from different male individuals , p < <dig>  , indicating an intact moe function. this result is consistent with previous observations showing that surgical removal of the vno does not affect the ability to distinguish urinary odors from different males  <cit> . furthermore, cgαo-/- females displayed intact preference for male versus female urine in a two-choice preference test , p < <dig>  ; figure 6f), also shown to remain unaffected after vno or aob surgical removal  <cit> .

no impact of the conditional gαo deletion on gαo expression in reproductive central nervous system nuclei
scent ownership recognition and preference, sexual receptivity, and estrous cycle regulation all require intact connections between the primary olfactory regions and central limbic and hypothalamic regions  <cit> . such brain regions are known to contain neurons positive for omp  <cit> . therefore, as a further control and to verify that the described loss of functions by the conditional gαo ablation were indeed caused by a loss of signaling in vsns, not in neurons of the central nervous system , we performed double-label immunostaining for omp and gαo in the cns. consistent with previous observations  <cit> , we found omp-positive cells in hypothalamic and amygdaloid nuclei of b <dig> and cgαo-/- females, including the paraventricular nucleus , medial preoptic area , and medial amygdala  . importantly, however, we found no overlap between omp and gαo immunostaining in any of these regions . moreover, both omp and gαo staining in th pvn, mpoa, and mea of cgαo-/- mice revealed very similar patterns of protein expression compared to b <dig> controls .

in a different approach, we also examined the reporter mouse line ompcre-erosa26τgfp in which omp expression drives the continuous expression of tau:green fluorescent protein fusion . as expected, we found gfp expression in the pvn, mpoa, and mea of adult female mice . double staining of gfp with gαo antibody in this mouse also revealed no overlap between these two markers in any of the regions examined . hence conditional, omp-cre-mediated ablation of gαo is unlikely to affect the function of omp-expressing cells in these brain nuclei.

discussion
the past decade has seen rapid progress in deciphering the essential role of the mammalian accessory olfactory system in chemical communication and the regulation of social behaviors  <cit> , but the functional significance of the anatomical and molecular segregation into vsns that express either of two different g protein subunits, gαo or gαi <dig>  has not been resolved. elucidating the specific behavioral roles of each of these vsn populations is required to understand whether and how these subsystems work together to represent the sensory environment and how exactly they control behavioral responses  <cit> .

to address these questions, we have developed a mouse strain that harbors a conditional deletion of the gnao <dig> gene under the control of the promoter of the omp gene  <cit> . we have shown that behavioral responses that depend on a functional main olfactory system are normal in these mice and that the mutation has no impact on gαo expression in omp-positive neurons that are present in some reproductive cns brain nuclei. we observed no obvious changes in the amount and distribution of omp-positive cells in hypothalamic and amygdaloid nuclei in gαo mutants and there was no obvious overlap between gαo and omp immunoreactivity in both b <dig> mice and a mouse line expressing an ompcre-erosa26τgfp reporter. furthermore, blood estradiol and progesterone levels, ovary morphology, and general fertility parameters were all normal in the gαo mutants. thus, our conditional gαo-mutant mice constitute an appropriate model to examine the role of gαo-expressing vsns in pheromone-stimulated behavioral responses of female mice. deletion of critical signaling molecules such as gαo, trpc <dig>  and gγ <dig> causes a significant reduction in the number of basal vno neurons  <cit> . given that we do not know whether this cell loss reflects loss of specific v2r-expressing vsns, we cannot fully rule out the possibility that some of the phenotypes identified here reflect dominant or neomorphic phenotypes. nonetheless, our results clearly define important functions of gαo-expressing vsns in different behavioral repertoires.

a key result of this report is that gαo signaling impacts on a much wider range of pheromone-dependent behaviors than previously anticipated. for example, our results reveal an unexpected delay in the initiation of puberty  and an altered estrous cycle  in the mutant mice, even without active stimulus presentation. this suggests that sensory input via gαo-expressing vsns is required for the normal display of puberty onset and the regulation of ovulatory signals  <cit> . furthermore, selective ablation of gαo conferred insensitivity to male urinary pheromones that facilitate the display of female reproductive behaviors: urine-stimulated puberty acceleration was defective in gαo-mutant females . the chemical nature of the puberty-accelerating pheromone is still unclear but at least two reports have linked puberty acceleration to mups or mup-derived peptides  <cit> . mups activate basal v2r-positive vsns and their vno detection is lost following gαo deletion  <cit> . thus, these studies are consistent with our findings showing defective puberty acceleration in gαo mutants. on the other hand, several reports have indicated a role for small organic molecules in puberty acceleration  <cit>  and some of these molecules are known to activate apical v1r/gαi2-expressing vsns which function normally in the gαo mutants  <cit> . one possible explanation for these seemingly divergent results is that gαo- and gαi2-expressing subsets of vsns could both be involved in these effects. such a scenario is not without precedent: the display of male territorial aggression and maternal aggression also seems to depend on the activation of both gαi2- and gαo-expressing vsns  <cit> . besides a lack of effect of male urine to induce uterine growth, we observed that gαo-mutant females showed larger uteri in the absence of stimulation . one potential explanation for this result is that the basal vsns are required for the lee-boot effect  <cit>  in which female urine may suppress uterine maturation. if so, in the absence of suppression, uterine weight will increase regardless of the stimulation. however, gαo mutants displayed a delayed first estrus  and unstimulated adults did not show more frequent estrous cycles , as would be expected in mice deficient for the lee-boot effect. therefore, we cannot currently confirm a direct dependency of this effect on gαo signaling.

another surprising finding was the critical role of gαo signaling in pheromone-induced estrus induction in adult mice. interestingly, gαo ablation not only abolished male urine-induced estrus induction, but also seemed to cause a reduction of days in estrus and proestrus . this result suggests that gαo-mutant females are not entirely unresponsive to estrus-modifying pheromones but the functional outcome of such chemosignals is altered, perhaps as a result of defective processing or integration with other pheromonal cues. consistent with this possibility, small organic molecules such as 2-sec-butyl- <dig> -dihydrothiazole, dehydro-exo-brevicomin, and α- and β-farnesenes have estrus-inducing effects in mice  <cit> . these cues are present in male urine, are known to activate vsns of the apical vno neuroepithelium  <cit> , and thus should still be detectable in the absence of gαo.

conditional deletion of gαo also has severe consequences on female sexual receptivity, that is, lordosis behavior. two measures of lordosis, lordosis quotient and number of females showing lordosis, indicated that this pheromone-stimulated behavioral response was absent or strongly diminished in the mutant mice . thus, intact gαo signaling is essential for this innate, female-specific sexual display. these results are consistent with studies demonstrating that the vmn2r <dig> receptor is involved in lordosis behavior  <cit>  and that detection of esp <dig> is severely reduced in vsns lacking gαo  <cit> . the fact that lordosis induced by exposure to both b <dig> and balb/c mice was diminished in the gαo mutants indicates that, besides esp <dig> and vmn2r <dig>  other pheromones and v2r receptors are probably involved in this behavior because b <dig> mice do not secrete esp <dig>  <cit> . we cannot yet completely rule out that the cycling phenotype as observed here impacts on lordosis but, as there was no evidence for ovarian or hormonal imbalance in our experiments , major effects of the cycling phenotype on lordosis seem unlikely.

importantly, gαo-mutant females were not only defective in a variety of pheromone-stimulated innate behaviors but also in learned social responses to pheromones. employing an established paradigm to assess mate recognition , our results provide direct evidence in support of a model in which gαo-positive vsns are critically involved in the detection of molecular cues related to genomic individuality. scent ownership recognition experiments demonstrated directly that this test required contact to chemical cues present in the hmw fraction of urine , consistent with a proposed role for mups in this function  <cit> . preference for individual male scents requires an associative learning step to provide a linkage between information contained in the volatile and the nonvolatile hmw urinary fractions; we demonstrated here that this learning requires intact gαo signaling . of note, gαo-mutant females could still discriminate the urine of two different males in a habituation-dishabituation test  and showed a preference for male versus female urine in a two-choice test , indicating that olfactory discrimination abilities were normal in these mice. furthermore, defective scent ownership recognition was not due to a loss of gender discrimination: gαo-mutant females did not display male-typical mating behaviors toward other conspecifics . such indiscriminate mounting has been reported previously in mice deficient in the cation channel trpc <dig>  <cit> . one of these studies  <cit>  employed a large open arena, but it is unclear whether the behavioral apparatus impacts on the display of male-like behaviors in trpc <dig> mutants.

we were unable to observe a second pheromone-dependent learning paradigm, the bruce effect, in gαo-mutant females. near-maximum non-pregnancy rates occurred with exposure to familiar cues or even without any additional stimulus exposure. we cannot yet determine whether this reflects a failure of the mutant mice to discriminate familiar from unfamiliar cues or whether other deficits such as poor mating performance , shorter receptive periods , and loss of mate recognition capabilities influence the outcome of this test. most likely, the low pregnancy rates reflect a combination of all of these defects. remarkably, cgαo-/- mice exhibited high variability on first litter latency, eventually expanding to values of up to  <dig> days , which could be consistent with a potential fertility defect. however, on average, first litter latencies and other fertility values in the null mice were not significantly different from the controls. as an explanation for the apparent contradiction between low bruce effect performance and normal fertility parameters, we believe that the sum of the described reproductive deficiencies may remain unnoticed in a laboratory environment: during the bruce effect test, males and females are mated for just  <dig> h in contrast to the fertility monitoring in which breeding pairs remain in permanent contact. however, gαo-mutant females would be unlikely to stay competitive under natural conditions where animals are subject to time-limited sexual encounters and where optimal reproductive performance is essential for reproductive success.

CONCLUSIONS
our experiments provide a systematic analysis of the importance of gαo and the gαo-expressing vsn subsystem for pheromone-stimulated sexual behaviors of female mice. we can now begin to determine the extent to which apical and basal vno subsystems regulate functionally distinct behavioral repertoires. future studies targeting specific pheromone receptor classes should also help to elucidate the neuronal logic underlying vital sexual and mating behaviors.
