BACKGROUND
the hypothesis that modern humans originated in africa and later migrated out to eurasia replacing there archaic humans  <cit>  has continued to gain support from genetic contributions  <cit> . anthropologically, the most ancient presence of modern humans out of africa has been documented in the levant about 95– <dig> kya  <cit> , and in australia about 50– <dig> kya  <cit> . based on archaeological  <cit>  and classic genetic studies  <cit>  two dispersals from africa were proposed: a northern route that reached western and central asia through the near east, and a southern route that, coasting asia, reached australia. however, ages for these dispersals were very tentative. the first phylogeographic analysis using complete mtdna genomic sequences dated the out of africa migrations around of 55– <dig> kya, when two branches, named m and n, of the african macrohaplogroup l <dig> radiation supposedly began the eurasian colonization  <cit> . a more recent analysis, based on a greater number of sequences, pushed back the lower bound of the out-of-africa migration, signed by the l <dig> radiation, to around  <dig> kya  <cit> . this date is no so far from the above commented presence of modern humans in the levant about 100– <dig> kya. interestingly, this migration is also in frame with the putative presence of modern humans in eritrean coasts  <cit> , and corresponds with an interglacial period , when african faunas expanded to the levant  <cit> . after that, it seems that, at least in the levant, there was a long period of population bottleneck, as there is no modern human evidence in the area until  <dig> kyr later, again in a relatively warm period . this contraction phase might be reflected in the basal roots of m and n lineages by the accumulation of  <dig> and  <dig> mutations before their next radiation around  <dig> kya  <cit> .

paradoxically this expansion began in a glacial period . at glacial stages it is supposed that aridity in the levant was a strong barrier to human expansions and that an alternative southern coastal route, crossing the bab al mandab strait to arabia, could be preferred. consequently, based on the phylogeographic distribution of m and n mtdna clusters, with the latter prevalent in western eurasia and the former more frequent in southern and eastern asia, it was proposed that two successive migrations out of africa occurred, being m and n the mitochondrial signals of the southern and northern routes respectively  <cit> . furthermore, the star radiation found for the indian and east asian m lineages was taken as indicative of a very fast southern dispersal  <cit> . however, posterior studies revealed the presence of autochthonous m and n lineages all along the southern route, from south asia  <cit> , through malaysia  <cit>  and to near oceania and australia  <cit> . accordingly, it was hypothesized that both lineages were carried out in a unique migration  <cit> , and even more, that the southern coastal trail was the only route, being the western eurasian colonization the result of an early offshoot of the southern radiation in india  <cit> . under these suppositions, the arabian peninsula, as an obliged step between east africa and south asia, has gained crucial importance, and indeed several mtdna studies have recently been published for this region  <cit> . however, it seems that the bulk of the arab mtdna lineages have northern neolithic or more recent asian or african origins. although a newly defined clade l <dig> in yemenis, with no close matches in the extant african populations, could suggest an ancient migration from africa to yemen  <cit> , the lack of n and/or m autochthonous lineages left the southern route without genetic support. it could be that unfavorable climatic conditions forced a fast migration through arabia without leaving a permanent track, but it is also possible that sample sizes have been insufficient to detect ancient residual lineages in the present day arab populations. to deal with this last possibility we have enlarged our previous sample of  <dig> saudi arabs  <cit>  to  <dig>  covering the main regions of this country . in this sample we sequenced the non-coding hvsi and hvsii mtdna regions and unequivocally assorted the obtained haplotypes into haplogroups analyzing diagnostic coding region positions by restriction fragment length polymorphisms  or fragment sequencing. furthermore, when rare haplotypes were found, we carried out genomic mtdna sequencing on them. in addition, the regional subdivision of the saudi samples and the analysis of the recently published mtdna data for yemen  <cit>  and for yemen, qatar, uae and oman  <cit>  allowed us to asses the population structure of the arabian peninsula and its relationships with surrounding populations.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> different mtdna haplotypes were observed in  <dig> saudi arab sequences.  <dig> of them  could have been detected using only the hvsi sequence information and  <dig>  when the hvsii information was also taken into account. additional analysis of diagnostic positions allowed the unequivocal assortment of the majority  of the haplotypes into subhaplogroups . however,  <dig> haplotypes were classified at the hv/r level,  <dig> assigned to macrohaplogroups l3*, m* and n* respectively, and only one was left unclassified . the most probable origin of these saudi haplotypes deserves a more detailed analysis.

macrohaplogroup l lineages
sub-saharan africa l lineages in saudi arabia account for 10% of the total. χ <dig> analyses showed that there is not significant regional differentiation in this country. however, there is significant heterogeneity  when all the arabian peninsula countries are compared. this is mainly due to the comparatively high frequency of sub-saharan lineages in yemen  compared to oman-qatar  and to saudi arabia-uae . most probably, the higher frequencies shown in southern countries reflect their greater proximity to africa, separated only by the bab al mandab strait. however, when attending to the relative contribution of the different l haplogroups, qatar, saudi arabia and yemen are highly similar for their l <dig> , l <dig>  and l <dig>  frequencies whereas in oman and uae the bulk of l lineages belongs to l <dig> . in this enlarged sample of saudi arabs, representatives of all the recently defined east african haplogroups l <dig>  <cit> , l <dig>  <cit> , l <dig>  <cit>  and l <dig>  <cit> , have been found. the only l <dig> saudi haplotype belongs to the l4a <dig> subclade defined by 16207t/c transversion. although it has no exact matches its most related types are found in ethiopia  <cit> . four l <dig> lineages have been found in saudi arabia but all have the same haplotype that belongs to the l5a <dig> subclade defined in the hvsi region by the 16355– <dig> motif  <cit> . it has matches in egypt and ethiopia. l <dig> was found the most abundant clade in yemen  <cit> . it has been now detected in saudi arabia but only once. this haplotype  differs from all the previous l <dig> lineages by the presence of mutation  <dig>  in addition it lacks the  <dig> transition that is carried by all l <dig> lineages from yemen but has the ancestral  <dig> mutation only absent in one yemeni lineage  <cit> . this saudi type adds l <dig> variability to arabia, because until now l <dig> was only represented by a very abundant and a rare haplotype in yemen. attending to the most probable geographic origin of the sub-saharan africa lineages in saudi arabia,  <dig>  have matches with east africa,  <dig>  with central or west africa whereas the rest  <dig>  have not yet been found in africa. nevertheless, half of them belong to haplogroups with western africa origin and the other half to haplogroups with eastern africa adscription  <cit> . it is supposed that the bulk of these african lineages reached the area as consequence of slave trade, but more ancient historic contacts with northeast africa are also well documented  <cit> .

macrohaplogroup m lineages
m lineages in saudi arabia account for 7% of the total. half of them belong to the m <dig> african clade. there is no significant heterogeneity within saudi arabia regions nor among arabian peninsula countries for the total m frequency. however, when we compared the frequency of the african clade m <dig> against that of the other m clades of asiatic provenance, it was significantly greater in western arabian peninsula regions than in the east .

inclusion of rare saudi and other published african m <dig> sequences into the m <dig> genomic phylogenetic tree
recent phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis of this haplogroup  <cit>  have suggested that the m1a <dig> subclade , is particularly abundant and diverse in ethiopia and m1b in northwest africa and the european and african mediterranean areas. other m1a subclades have a more generalized african distribution. half of the m <dig> lineages in saudi arabia belong to the ethiopian m1a <dig> subclade and the same proportion holds for other arabian peninsula countries  <cit> . however, as a few m <dig> haplotypes did not fit in the m1a <dig> cluster we did genome sequencing for two of them . lineage  <dig> resulted to be a member of the north african clade m1b, more specifically to the m1b1a branch. as we have detected another m1b lineage in jordan  <cit> , it is possible that the saudi one could have reached arabia from the levant or from northwest african areas. the second saudi lineage  belongs to a subcluster  that is also frequent in east africa  <cit> . recently, tanzanian lineages have been studied by means of complete mtdna sequences  <cit> . three of these sequences also fall into the m <dig> haplogroup. two of them belong to the ethiopian m1a <dig> subclade , and the third  shares the entire motif that characterizes lineage m1a <dig>  <cit>  with the exception of transition  <dig>  therefore, this mutation should define a new subcluster m1a5a . the lineages found in tanzania further expand, southeastwards, the geographic range of m <dig> in sub-saharan africa. inspecting the m <dig> phylogeny of olivieri et al.  <cit>  we realized that our lineage  <dig>  <cit>  has the diagnostic positions  <dig>  that defines m1a <dig> and  <dig> that defines the m1a3a branch. therefore, we have placed it as an m1a3a lineage with an  <dig> retromutation . it seems that, likewise l lineages, the m <dig> presence in the arabian peninsula signals a predominant east african influence with possible minor introductions from the levant.

inclusion of rare saudi asiatic m sequences into the macrohaplogroup m tree
the majority  of the  <dig> m lineages found in the arabian peninsula that do not belong to m <dig>  have matches or are related to indian clades, which confirm previous results  <cit> . in addition, in this expanded saudi sample, we have found some sequences with geographic origins far away from the studied area. for instance, lineage  <dig>  has been classified in the eastern asia subclade g2a1a  <cit>  but probably it has reached saudi arabia from central asia where this branch is rather common and diverse  <cit> . indubitably the four sequences  are q <dig> members and had to have their origin in indonesia. in fact their most related haplotypes were found in west new guinea  <cit> . all these sequences could have arrived to arabia as result of recent gene flow. particularly documented is the preferential female indonesian migration to saudi arabia as domestic workers  <cit> . five undefined m lineages were genome sequenced . it is confirmed that  <dig> of the  <dig> saudi lineages analyzed have also indian roots. lineage  <dig> falls into the indian m <dig> clade because it has the diagnostic  <dig> transition. in addition, it shares  <dig> transitions  with the indian lineage c <dig>  <cit> , which allows the definition of a new subclade m33a. lineage  <dig> is a member of the indian m <dig> clade because it possesses its three diagnostic mutations . as it also shares  <dig> additional positions with the indian clade t <dig>  <cit> , both conform an m36a branch . saudi  <dig> belongs to the indian clade m <dig> as it has its diagnostic motif . lineage  <dig> also belongs to the related indian clade m4b defined by transitions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in addition it shares mutation  <dig> with the c <dig> indian lineage  <cit>  that could define a new m4b <dig> subclade. we have classified sequence  <dig> as belonging to a new indian clade m <dig> defined by a four transitions motif  which is shared with the m indian lineage r <dig> . australian clade m <dig>  <cit>  and new britain m <dig> clade  <cit>  also have  <dig> transition as a basal mutation. however, they are respectively more related to the east asia clade m <dig>  <cit>  and to the melanesian q clade  <cit> , as their additionally shared basal mutations are less recurrent than transition <dig>  <cit> . all these indian m sequences have been found in arabia as isolated lineages that belong to clusters with deep roots and high diversity in india. therefore, its presence in arabia is better explained by recent backflow from india than by supposing that these lineages are footsteps of an m ancestral migration across arabia.

the saudi sequence  <dig> deserves special mention . it was previously tentatively related to the indian m <dig> clade because both share the  <dig> transition. however, it was stated that due to the high recurrence of  <dig> most probably the  <dig> sequence would belong to a yet undefined clade  <cit> . the recent study of new australian lineages  <cit>  has allowed us to find out an interesting link between their australian m <dig> lineage and our saudi  <dig> sequence . the authors related m <dig> to the melanesian clade m <dig>  <cit>  because both share the 1719– <dig> motif  <cit> . we think that the alternative motif shared with the saudi lineage, 234-4216- <dig>   is stronger, as  <dig> and  <dig> transitions are more recurrent than  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we think that the last three mutations defined the true root of the australian m <dig> clade and relate it to a saudi arab sequence.

macrohaplogroup n lineages
all the main non r west eurasian haplogroups that directly spread from the root of macrohaplogroup n  were present in saudi arabia albeit in low frequencies . summing up, their total frequency only represents 12% of the saudi pool. there is no heterogeneity among saudi regions for the joint distribution of these haplogrups, which is in contrast with the high differentiation observed  when all the arabian peninsula countries were compared. however, this is mainly due to the high frequency in uae of unclassified n* lineages  <cit> . the three n <dig> subgroups have similar frequencies  in saudi arabia , but haplotypic diversity  reach different levels being comparatively high for n1b  or n1a  and lower for n1c . n1a is also very diverse  in yemen  <cit>  but there are no haplotypic matches between both arabian countries, and only one  of the  <dig> saudi haplotypes has an exact match in ethiopia. the high diversity of n1a in the arabian peninsula, ethiopia and egypt raises the possibility that this area was a secondary center of expansion for this haplogroup. however, the highest diversity for n1b and n1c are in turkey, and kurds and iranians, respectively . only haplogroup n1c shows significant  regional distribution in saudi being the highest frequencies in the northern region . haplogroup i has been only detected in central and southeastern regions in saudi arabia and in all arabian peninsula countries with the exception of uae  <cit> . haplogroup w has not been found in the western saudi region nor in the southern arabian yemen and oman countries  <cit> . finally, haplogroup x is present in all the saudi regions and in all arabian countries excepting oman  <cit> . two geographically well differentiated x branches can be distinguished by hvsii positions  <cit> . the north african specific subclade x <dig> was defined by the  <dig> transition and the eurasian specific subclade x <dig> by the  <dig> transition. as it was already found in yemen  <cit> , all the x haplotypes found in saudi arabia have the  <dig> transition, falling within the eurasian branch, which discards east african introductions. curiously, only the basic haplotype  has matches with other regions.

macrohaplogroup r lineages
macrohaplogroup r is the main branch of n and their major subclades  embraced the majority of the west eurasian mtdna lineages. in saudi arabia r derivates represent a  % of the total having a homogeneous regional distribution. this contrasts with the significant heterogeneity  found for the whole arabian peninsula, although it is due to the low frequency of r in yemen . the western asia haplogroup h is the most abundant haplogroup in europe and the near east  <cit> . however in the arabian peninsula its mean frequency  is moderate, reaching its highest value in oman  and its lowest, again, in yemen . within saudi arabia, the highest frequencies are in the northern and central regions  and the lowest in the west region , being crs, h2a <dig> and h <dig> the most abundant subclades which confirm other authors results  <cit> . haplogroup t shows regional heterogeneity in saudi arabia  and has significantly lower frequencies in southern yemen and oman countries . furthermore, whereas subclade t <dig> is the most abundant in the saudi central region, subclades t <dig> and t <dig> are so in northern and western regions. haplogroup u comprises numerous branches  that have different geographic distributions  <cit> . in saudi arabia all of them have representatives albeit in minor frequencies, k  and u <dig>  being the most abundant clades. there is no geographical heterogeneity for the total u distribution in saudi arabia. nevertheless, it is significantly different among the arabian peninsula countries , with southern countries showing higher frequencies than the others . analysis of specific haplogroups reveals some interesting geographic distributions in the arabian peninsula. the european clade u2e and the rare clade u <dig>  could have reached the arabian peninsula from northern areas. on the contrary, the indian clade u <dig> , u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  and k , most probably came from the east. finally, the north african clade u <dig>  had a western provenance. haplogroup  <dig> was phylogenetically and phylogeographically studied in detail previously  <cit> . however, this enlarged saudi sample has allowed a regional analysis in saudi arabia. an heterogeneity test showed that  <dig> is significantly  more abundant in northern  and central  regions, and has particularly low frequency in the west region . extending the analysis to the whole arabian peninsula the heterogeneity grows considerably . this is mainly due to the comparatively lower frequencies in yemen, qatar and uae . most probably, this haplogroup reached arabia from the north  <cit> , extending its geographic range to the south using mainly internal instead of coastal routes. as a whole, haplogroup j reaches its highest frequency in saudi arabia  <cit> , where its regional distribution is also significantly heterogeneous , but opposite to that found for  <dig>  for the j, the west  and southeast  regions have higher frequencies than the central  and north  regions. heterogeneity in the whole peninsula is also significant  being saudi arabia  and qatar  the two countries with the highest j frequencies. however, the subclade distribution is different in each country. subclade j1b is the main contributor  in saudi arabia while other j subclades account for  <dig> % in qatar . with the qatar exception, j1b is the most frequent subclade in the arabian peninsula . so for, it deserves more detailed phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies.

phylogeny of haplogroup j1b
we have used  <dig> haplogroup j complete sequences to construct a refined j1b phylogeny. as a subclade of j <dig>  j1b is characterized by transition  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in addition, j1b is defined by transition  <dig> in the coding region and by the hvsi motif, 16145-16222- <dig> . transitions  <dig> and  <dig> are now diagnostic of the j1b <dig> subclade, previously named j1b  <cit> . in addition, the 242-2158- <dig> motif defines a j1b1a branch. furthermore, sequences carrying transitions  <dig> and  <dig> cluster now into the j1b1a <dig> clade formerly named j1b <dig>  <cit> . finally, transition  <dig> defines an additional j1b1a1b group . in order to accurately incorporate our previously published j1b moroccan sequence  <cit>  into the present phylogeny, we have re-sequenced all the fragments comprising any mutation present in related branches. only transition  <dig> was overlooked in our anterior analysis. this moroccan sequence shares the  <dig> transition with four hispanic sequences defining a new j1b <dig> clade . using time for the most recent common ancestor  as an upper bound for a cluster radiation, we estimated a paleolithic time of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years for the entire j1b clade and a neolithic age of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years for the j1b1a <dig> subclade.

phylogeography of haplogroup j1b
population based comparisons
in order to assess the degree of regional differentiation in saudi arabia we performed amova analyses, based on haplogroup  and haplotypic  frequencies. they showed significant inter regional variability, mainly due to the heterogeneous composition of the central region. haplogroup frequency differentiation is also found when all the arabian peninsula countries were taken into account . in spite of this, when the arabian peninsula samples were compared with those of surrounding african, near east and caucasus areas by means of pair-wise fst distances, based on haplogroup frequencies, and their relationships graphically represented , it is worth mentioning that all the saudi samples, including a small bedouin sample  <cit> , closely cluster together. however, two arabian peninsula countries, yemen and uae, showed marginal positions. the first, due to its greater frequency of african l haplogroups, congruently approaches egypt and nubian, whereas the second, due to the relative scarcity of this african component and the greater contribution of eurasian clades  to its mtdna pool, is placed in close proximity to the near east samples .

discussion
eurasian and african influences in the arabian peninsula
although until recent times the majority of the saudi arabia population was nomad, a moderate level of mitochondrial genetic structure has been found amongst its different regions. this heterogeneity grew considerably when all the arabian peninsula countries were included in the amova analysis. it seems that the main cause of this diversity is the unequal influence that the different areas received from their geographically closest neighbors. this fact is graphically reflected in the mds plot  where all the arabian peninsula samples are compared with samples from east africa, the near east and the caucasus areas. the clustering of all the saudi regions clearly shows that, in comparison to other geographically more distant populations, they form a rather homogenous entity, as was previously suggested from analysis based on classical markers  <cit> . the more distant positions of yemen, grouped with african samples, and the uae, and in a lesser degree the qatar and oman, proximity to near east countries, reflect their different frequencies of african and eurasian lineages in their respective mitochondrial pools. roughly, the african contribution to whole arabian peninsula accounts for 20% of its lineages if, in addition to all the l haplogroups, the north african m <dig> and u <dig> clades are added. however, the western and southern areas have received significantly stronger influences than the rest. particularly, yemen has the largest contribution of l lineages  <cit> . so, most probably, this area was the entrance gate of a portion of these lineages in prehistoric times, which participated in the building of the primitive arabian population. later, received gene flows from north africa and the near east, and suffered expansions and retractions in humid or arid climatic periods. these fluctuations are also reflected in the frequent loss of diversity for several african clades as the l <dig> in yemen  <cit>  or the l <dig> in saudi arabia. however, the presence of western africa l lineages and the different composition of l subclades in the african pool of different countries might reflect unequal participation of the primitive and the recent slave trade substrates in their respective african components.

an important group of the arabian peninsula lineages , comprising representatives of the majority of the u clades, r <dig>  and central asian, indian, and indonesian m lineages, seem to have their origins in the east, reaching the arabian peninsula through iran where, in contrast to the near east, the u clades  have the highest frequency instead of the h  group  <cit> . congruently, this eastern gene flow had a significantly stronger impact in the eastern and southern areas of the arabian peninsula. however, the bulk of the arabian n and r lineages  had a northern source. haplogroups  <dig> and j1b were the main contributors of this gene flow. nevertheless, its present day geographic distributions in the arabian peninsula are different. whereas  <dig> presents significant higher frequencies in the north and central saudi regions and in oman, j1b shows its highest frequencies in the more peripheral west and southeast saudi regions. it seems that at least haplogroups h, n1c and subclade t <dig> could have followed the  <dig> internal way of dispersion, while the t <dig> and t <dig> branches of haplogroup t and other branches of haplogroup j followed the peripheral route of clade j1b. attending to the radiation ages of  <dig> and j1b clades and their derivate branches, striking similarities but also differences can be observed. the first expansion of both clades in the near east had similar paleolithic ages around  <dig>  years ago. however whereas the ancestral hvsi motif of the  <dig> expansion was barely present in saudi arabia  <cit> , the ancestral hvsi motif of the j1b radiation had an important incidence in that area  suggesting an active role in arabia of the first j1b spread but not for that of  <dig>  the succeeding most important radiations of both clades, 1a <dig> and j1b1a <dig> had, again, similar ages around  <dig>  years that place them in neolithic times. now, in both cases, there is a shortage or absence of the ancestral motif in arabia discarding this area as a radiation center. however, it participated in the 1a <dig> spread  <cit>  but not in the j1b1a <dig> one . finally, the third more abundant subclades, 1b rooted by  <dig>  <cit>  and j1b rooted by  <dig>  had the arabian peninsula as the most probable source of expansion. nevertheless, whereas the j1b branch tmrca  was contemporary to that of the northern j1b1a <dig>  the recalculated age of the 1b branch , was of only  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years ago which situates this expansion in the bronze age. these results could be satisfactorily explained if we admit an older paleolithic implantation in saudi arabia of the j1b clade that, perhaps, with some other n and l clades would form the primitive population. posterior  <dig> subclade radiations, accompanied by other clades, penetrated from the north using internal routes and even had secondary spreads in central arabia diluting the j1b frequencies in these areas and causing its peripheral distribution.

genomic dissection of rare m lineages
by genomic sequencing of seven m lineages , it has been demonstrated that the majority of the rare m lineages detected in saudi arabia  have indian roots. however, the link found between the m saudi  <dig> sequence and an m <dig> australian sequence is puzzling. although at first sight it could be taken as a signal of the connection between the two utmost ends of the southern route, it seems not to be the case. first, both lineages share three basal positions and this hypothetical link would considerably delay the arrival age of m in comparison to that of east asia. it would be improbable that similar australian links with other m lineages mainly from india were not found. third, if the arab lineage had such an old implantation in the arabian peninsula some detectable autochthonous radiation should be expected. most probably, the m <dig> sequence belongs to an australian clade and its related lineage found in saudi arabia is also of australian origin. historical links as those invoked to explain the presence of indian and indonesian sequences in the arabian peninsula pool should also be valid for this case. in our opinion, the camel trade between saudi arabia and australia  <cit>  could be a probable historic cause of this link. future detection in aboriginal australians of other m <dig> lineages will confirm the australian origin of this clade and its radiation age in that continent. however, the link between the east asia m <dig> clade  <cit>  and the australian m <dig> clade, if not due to convergence, seems to be more interesting as it would confirm, once more, the rapid expansion of macrohaplogroup m all along the asian coasts  <cit> . the lack of autochthonous m and n lineages in the present day arabian peninsula populations confirms that this area was not a place of demographic expansion in the dispersal out of africa  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
although there is evidence of neolithic and more recent expansions in the arabian peninsula, mainly detected by  <dig> and j1b lineages, the lack of primitive autochthonous m and n sequences, suggests that this area has been more a receptor of human migrations, including historic ones, from africa, india, indonesia and even australia, than a demographic expansion center along the proposed southern coastal route.
