BACKGROUND
with the explosion of various 'omic' data, a general question facing the biologists and statisticians is how to summarize and organize the observed data into meaningful structures. clustering is one of the methods that have been widely explored for this purpose  <cit> . in particular, clustering is being generally applied to gene expression data to group genes with similar expression profiles into discrete functional clusters. many clustering methods are available, including hierarchical clustering  <cit> , k-means clustering  <cit> , self-organizing maps  <cit> , and various model-based methods  <cit> .

recent research in clustering analysis has been focused largely on two areas: estimating the number of clusters in data  <cit>  and the optimization of the clustering algorithms  <cit> . in this paper we studied a different yet fundamental issue in clustering analysis: to define an appropriate measure of similarity for gene expression patterns.

the most commonly used distances or similarity measures for analyzing gene expression data are the pearson correlation coefficient and euclidean distance, which however, in some situations, could be unsuitable to explore the true gene relationship. the pearson correlation coefficient is overly sensitive to the shape of an expression curve, and the euclidean distance mainly considers the magnitude of the changes of the gene expression. for other model-based methods  <cit> , their successes would highly rely on how well the assumed probability model fits the data and the clustering purpose.

in recent literature, several advanced measures with emphasis on the expression profile shape have been developed in different contexts  <cit> . in particular, based on the spearman rank correlation, clarity was defined for detecting the local similarity or time-shifted patterns in expression profiles  <cit> . however, the rank-based methods could mistakenly interpret a pattern since the use of rank causes information loss. as an example, we consider a profile y =  with all components generated from the same poisson distribution of mean  <dig>  clearly, the differences among the components in y are due to the distribution variance and ranking in this case is meaningless. briefly, spearman rank correlation cannot distinguish the real differences from random errors in some situations and thus may provide a wrong estimate of the pattern.

by separately modeling the shape and the magnitude parameters in a gene expression profile, we developed a new measure for clustering the genes when the profile shape is a key factor, and when the expression magnitude should also be accounted for in determining the gene relationship. the approach is to use the estimated shape and magnitude parameters to define a chi-square-statistic based distance measure in a new feature space. an appropriate feature space helps summarize the data more effectively, hence improving the identification of gene relationships. we explored different transformation schemes to construct the feature spaces, which include a space with features determined by the mutual differences of the original expression components, a space derived from a parametric covariance matrix, and the principal component space in pca analysis  <cit> . the former two are the newly proposed and the latter is explored for comparison purposes.

the new measures associated with different feature spaces were employed in a k-means clustering procedure to perform clustering analyses. we designated the algorithm using the measure from the first transformed space as transchisq, and the one associated with the principal component space as pcachisq. the space derived from a parametric covariance matrix is not included in comparison for computational reasons . for evaluation purposes we also implemented a set of widely used measures into the k-means clustering procedure, including pearson correlation coefficient , euclidian distance , spearman rank correlation , and a chi-square based measure for poisson distributed data   <cit> . all the measures were applied to a simulation dataset, a developing mouse retina sage dataset of  <dig> tags  <cit> , a small yeast sporulation cdna dataset  <cit> , and a maize root affymetrix microarray dataset  <cit> . the results showed that transchisq outperforms other methods. using the gap statistic  <cit> , transchisq was also found to be advantageous in estimating the number of clusters. the underlying probability model of our method was adopted from the model of poissonc, a method for analyzing the expression patterns in serial analysis of gene expression  data  <cit> . the matlab source codes for all these algorithms are available upon request.

RESULTS
first, we will illustrate the property of the proposed new transformations by applying them to a maize gene expression dataset. then we will present the applications of transchisq, pcachisq and other methods to a simulation dataset, a yeast sporulation microarray dataset, and a mouse retinal sage dataset.

experimental maize gene expression data
the maize dataset, consisting of nine affymetrix microarrays, was generated to investigate the gene transcription activity in three maize root tissues with three replicates for each tissue: the proximal meristem , the quiescent center  and the root cap   <cit> .  <dig> significantly differentially expressed genes have been identified and categorized into  <dig> classes of expression patterns  <cit> . here we used these genes to illustrate the property of the proposed transformations with comparison to the traditional pca.

firstly, we applied the transformation employed in transchisq to the data. figures 1– plot the expression profiles of the genes in this new space. the blue and red genes are from the two dominant classes  and the other four colors  correspond to the other four small classes . the three plots show that the six classes can be recognized explicitly in any of the three subspaces of dimension  <dig> 

we then applied the transformation suggested by a parametric covariance matrix to the same data . figures 1– plot the expression profiles of the genes in this new space. we can see that the second and the third component separate all six classes in figure  <dig> correctly. the description of the six class separating regions, whose centers are the dotted lines in figure  <dig>  is in table  <dig> . a convenient common property of this transformation, and the one in transchisq, is that the information carried by each component is explicit, and hence the region in the new space corresponding to each class can be clearly determined.

for comparison, we performed a traditional pca analysis to the same data. figures 1– plot the expression profiles of the genes in the principal component space. we can see that the direct application of the pca can separate the two dominating expression patterns. but it fails to recognize the other patterns, even when exhausting all principal components. the poor performance of pca could be attributed to the use of empirical sample covariance matrix in determining the principal components. in the maize dataset, about 94% genes are rc up- or down-regulated genes, which cause most of the variance. the principal components, determined by this sample covariance matrix thus largely capture the two dominating clusters, yet miss the meaningful class information for the other four small groups.

this example demonstrates the advantage of the proposed new data transformations over the traditional pca in keeping class information intact.

simulation study
we applied transchisq to a simulation dataset to evaluate its performance. for comparison purposes, other modified k-means algorithms, i.e. pcachisq, poissonc, pearsonc, and eucli were also applied to the same dataset.

the simulation dataset consists of  <dig> vectors of dimension  <dig> and the components are independently generated from different normal distributions. the mean  and variance  of the normal distributions are constrained by σ <dig> = 3μ and described in table  <dig>  based on the normal distributions they are generated from, the  <dig> vectors are put into six groups, i.e., a, b, c, d, e, and f, whose sizes are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> respectively. the motivation and guideline on choosing the various parameters related to this simulation datasets are presented in additional file  <dig>  genes with a similar expression shape are considered to be in the same group. although the expression magnitude in the dataset is not a critical factor for determining the gene clusters, its information is useful and should be taken into account when comparing the profile shapes.

the clustering results from different methods are shown in figure  <dig>  the horizontal axis represents the index of the  <dig> genes that belong to six groups . the vertical axis represents the index of the cluster to which each gene has been assigned by a particular algorithm. only transchisq correctly categorized the genes into six groups. pcachisq, poissonc, and pearsonc mixed up group a and group b. eucli clustered genes mainly by the magnitude of the gene expression values rather than the changes of the profile shapes. to reduce the effects from the magnitude, we further applied eucli to the rescaled data. the rescaling was performed in a way so that the sum of the components within each vector was set the same. the clustering result of eucli on the rescaled data ) is better, but not perfect.

we performed an additional  <dig> replications of the above simulation. transchisq, pcachisq and poissonc correctly clustered  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the  <dig> replicate simulation datasets, while pearsonc, eucli and eucli on rescaled data cannot generate correct clusters. we also tried pcachisq on different combinations of principal components to optimize the clustering results. these different combinations, however, are not helpful to identify all the six groups.

this study evaluates the performance of transchisq on the normally distributed data with poisson-like property: variance increases with mean. the success of this application sheds a light on applying transchisq to a microarray dataset in addition to the sage data.

experimental mouse retinal sage data
for further validation we applied transchisq, pcachisq, poissonc, pearsonc, eucli and src  to a set of mouse retinal sage libraries. the raw mouse retinal data consists of  <dig> sage libraries  from developing retina taken at 2-day intervals. the samples range from embryonic, to postnatal, to adult  <cit> . among the  <dig> tags,  <dig> tags that have counts greater than or equal to  <dig> in at least one of the  <dig> libraries were selected. the purpose of this selection is to exclude the genes with uniform low expression. to be more effective in comparing the clustering algorithms, a subset of  <dig> sage tags with known biological functions were selected. these  <dig> tags fall into  <dig> functional groups:  <dig> of these genes are developmental genes that can be further categorized into four classes by their activities at different developmental stages; the other  <dig> genes are not relevant to the mouse retina development . the average expression profile for each of the five clusters is shown in figure  <dig> 

transchisq, pcachisq, poissonc, pearsonc, eucli and src were applied to group these  <dig> sage tags into five clusters. here we assumed that the number of the clusters, k, is known. a study to evaluate the performance of different measures in determining k when it is unknown can be found in a later section of this paper. the clustering results showed that transchisq and pcachisq outperform others :  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the  <dig> tags are incorrectly clustered by transchisq, pcachisq, poissonc, pearsonc and eucli on rescaled data respectively. for the results from eucli on original data, as the correspondence between the predicted clusters and the true clusters is unclear, we cannot report the number of incorrectly clustered tags. we also evaluated the quality of the clustering results against an external criterion, the adjusted rand index  <cit> . the adjusted rand index assesses the degree of agreement between two partitions of the same set of objects. we compared the clustering results from each algorithm with the true categorizations, and calculated the adjusted rand index accordingly. the adjusted rand index varies between  <dig>  and  <dig> . a higher adjusted rand index represents the higher correspondence between the two partitions. from table  <dig>  we can see that the adjusted rand index results confirm that transchisq and pcachisq perform similarly and have clear advantages over other methods.

microarray yeast sporulation gene expression data
to further demonstrate how effective transchisq is in clustering genes with characterized patterns in a microarray analysis, we applied transchisq to a microarray yeast sporulation dataset  <cit> . chu et al. measured gene expressions in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae at seven time points during sporulation using spotted microarrays, and identified seven distinct temporal patterns of induction  <cit> .  <dig> representative genes were used to define the model expression profile for each pattern. based on their properties, the seven patterns are designated as metabolic, early i, early ii, early-mid, middle, mid-late and late. the average expression profiles for these seven patterns are presented in figure  <dig>  the genes in early i, early ii, middle, mid-late and late initiates induction of expression at  <dig>  h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively, and sustains expression through the rest of the time course. the expression of metabolic genes is also induced at  <dig>  h as in early i, but decays afterwards. the expression of genes in early-mid is induced not only at the  <dig>  h and  <dig> h as in early genes, but also at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, as in the middle and mid-late genes. this data structure made it difficult to separate the early-mid genes from others. the direct clustering analyses using pearsonc or eucli were not successful.

prior to analyzing the data we substituted the expression ratios that were below zero with zeros as in figure  <dig>  this truncation of negative values simplifies the expression patterns of the  <dig> representative genes with the key properties in each pattern being intact. the clustering results are summarized in table  <dig>  we can see that transchisq outperforms other methods:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the  <dig> genes are incorrectly clustered by transchisq, poissonc, eucli, pearsonc, pcachisq and eucli on rescaled data respectively. transchisq also shows the best adjusted rand index. it is interesting to see that the performance of eucli on rescaled data is worse than it is on original data. this suggests that the magnitude information should be critical and cannot be ignored in determining the seven classes. as we have discussed, all methods fail to discern the genes in early-mid from the genes in early i, early ii, middle, mid-late and late –). furthermore, pcachisq and poissonc mixed up two different patterns from metabolic and early i because of their similar induction time at  <dig>  h  and 5). pearsonc even splits the metabolic group further into two separate clusters ).

for pcachisq, we tried different combinations of principal components  to optimize the clustering results. the best result can be reached when the first  <dig> pcs were used:  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes were incorrectly grouped. this optimal result is the same as the one from transchisq. however, in practice, it is not feasible to exhaust all possible combinations of pcs to search for the optimal clustering result.

estimating the number of clusters using gap statistics
an unsolved issue in k-means clustering analysis is how to estimate k, the number of clusters. in the recent literature the gap statistic was found useful  <cit> . the technique of the gap statistic uses the output of any clustering algorithm to compare the 'between-to-total variance ' with that expected under an appropriate reference null distribution. a high r <dig> value represents high variability between clusters and high coherence within clusters. below we sketch how to calculate the gap statistic: let dk be the r <dig> measure for the clustering output when the number of clusters is k. to derive the reference expected value of dk, the elements within each row of original data are permuted to produce the new matrices with random profile patterns. assume b such matrices are obtained. then for each matrix, a new r <dig> is calculated based on the original clustering output and the pre-selected similarity measure. the average of these r2's, denoted by d¯k

the value of k with the largest gap value will be selected as the optimal number of clusters in that at this k, the observed between-to-total variance r <dig> is the most ahead of expected.

for comparison, we used different measures including transchisq, pcachisq, poissonc, pearson, eucli, and src to calculate the gap statistics for each of the two experimental datasets: microarray yeast sporulation data and mouse retinal sage data. for the microarray yeast sporulation data, the gap values from different measures over different number of clusters are shown in figure  <dig>  we can see that transchisq shows the maximum gap value at k =  <dig>  in other words, transchisq finds an optimal number of  <dig> clusters, which agrees with the known functional categorization of the genes. other measures all produce incorrect estimates of the number of clusters on the same dataset. in a similar analysis of the sage data, transchisq, pcachisq and poissonc provide a correct estimate on the number of clusters,  <dig>  pearsonc, eucli and src give an incorrect estimate of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively . this study shows that when the number of clusters, k, is unknown, the gap statistics can be used to estimate k, and transchisq is favorable over others on estimating the true number of clusters in both experimental datasets.

discussions and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we proposed a method, transchisq, to group genes with similar expression shapes. the expression magnitude was considered when measuring the shape similarity. results from applications to a variety of datasets demonstrated transchisq's clear advantages over other methods. furthermore, with the gap statistics, transchisq was also found to be effective in estimating the number of clusters. regarding the computational efficiency, transchisq, pcachisq and poissonc have similar costs but usually run a few times  slower than the pearsonc and eucli.

we have embedded different measures in the k-means clustering procedure to reveal the important gene expression patterns. in addition to k-means, our new measure can also be implemented in other clustering methods, e.g., hierarchical clustering  <cit> , to perform the analysis. in a hierarchical clustering procedure, the distance of any two gene expression profiles can be defined using measure  by assuming that two genes form a cluster. a study on the performance of different measures in a hierarchical clustering procedure is in additional file  <dig>  our new method also outperforms others when implemented in the hierarchical clustering algorithm.

we view different measures as complementary rather than competing in that each has its advantages. in general, transchisq would be effective when it is necessary to consider the magnitude information in measuring the shape similarity. in clustering analyses of sage and microarray data, very often the magnitude information should be taken into account, whereas the shape could be a more critical factor to determine the gene relationship.

although the proposed method is very promising, it does require further study on possible data transformation schemes when the original data show a more complex structure, or when the clustering purpose is different. we suggest our method could provide new insights to the applications of different data transformations in clustering analysis of gene expression data.
