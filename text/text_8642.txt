BACKGROUND
numerous functional rna motifs have been identified as playing significant roles in many essential biological processes, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, control of mrna stability, alternative splicing, and transcription termination. the biological activities of functional rna motifs usually rely on a combination of their primary sequences and specific secondary structures, which act as target sites of rna-binding factors or directly interact with translation machinery  <cit> . for instance, riboswitches are metabolite-binding domain within a specific mrna, and can regulate both transcription and translation by binding their corresponding targets  <cit> .

several databases were established for collecting functional rna molecules  <cit> . utrdb  <cit>  is a database of 5' and 3' untranslated sequences of eukaryotic mrnas. it provides specialized information including the presence of nucleotide sequence patterns already demonstrated by experimental analysis to have some functional roles, and these patterns have been collected into the utrsite database. rfam  <cit>  is a database comprehensively collecting families of non-coding rna  genes as well as cis-regulatory rna elements. each family is represented by a multiple sequence alignment of known and predicted representative members, and annotated with a consensus base-paired secondary structure. it facilitates the identification and classification of new members of known rna families, and provides the glimpses of conservation of multiple ncrna families across a wide taxonomic range. frnadb  <cit>  is a database hosting a large collection of ncrna sequence data from public non-coding databases, and provides related annotations, such as sequence ontology classification and source organisms. aedb is a database for alternative exons and their properties from numerous species, and it forms the manually curated component of alternative splicing database   <cit> . the data in aedb is gathered from literature where these exons have been experimentally verified. the adenylate uridylate-rich elements  mediate the rapid turnover of mrna encoding proteins that regulate cellular growth and body response to exogenous agent such as microbes and environmental stimuli. ared  <cit>  is a human au-rich element-containing mrna database. a 13-bp are pattern was computationally derived using meme, and five clusters were generated from are sequences. noncode  <cit>  is an integrated knowledge database designed for analysis of ncrnas. all ncrnas in noncode were confirmed by consulting the references manually and more than 80% data are from experiments. micrornas  are small rna molecules, which are ~ <dig> nt sequences, and participate in gene post-transcriptional regulation and degradation of mrna by hybridizing to mirna target sites. mirbase  <cit>  is the central online repository for mirna nomenclature, sequence data annotation and target prediction. it provides a range of data to facilitate studies of mirna genomics. transfac  <cit>  is a knowledge-base containing published data on eukaryotic transcription factors, their experimentally-proven binding site, and regulated genes.

various approaches were developed for identifying functional rna motifs or elements  <cit> . genesplicer  <cit>  was developed for detecting splice sites in eukaryotic mrna by combining several techniques, such as maximal dependence decomposition  and markov model, that have already proven successful in characterizing the patterns around the donor and acceptor sites. polya_svm  <cit>  was developed for predicting mrna polyadenylation site using a support vector machine  featuring  <dig> over-represented cis-regulatory elements in various regions surrounding. rbsfinder  <cit>  is a probabilistic method to improve the accuracy of gene identification systems at finding precise translation start sites. transtermhp  <cit>  can rapidly and accurately detecting rho-independent transcription terminators. cure  <cit>  was developed for predicting c-to-u rna editing site in plant mitochondria by incorporating both evolutionary and biochemical information. miranda  <cit>  was developed for finding genomic targets for mirnas. ribosw  <cit>  is a systematic method for identifying  <dig> kinds of riboswitches based on rna conserved functional sequences and conformations. patsearch  <cit>  was developed for searching specific combinations of oligonucleotide consensus sequences, secondary structure motifs and position-weight matrices . erpin  <cit>  is a practical approach for the automatic derivation of an rna signature from a sequence alignment and secondary structure, and finding the occurrence in sequence databases. several profiles have been constructed to search any input sequence for the presence of some rna genes and elements on erpin web server. infernal  <cit>  is an implementation of a general stochastic context-free grammars  based approach for rna database searches and multiple alignment. it is used to annotate rnas in genomes in conjunction with the rfam families by covariance models, a special case of scfgs designed for modeling rna consensus sequence and structure. match  <cit>  is an approach for searching transcription factor binding sites with specific position-weight matrices . rnamotif  <cit>  is an rna secondary structure definition and search algorithm, and commonly used for searching user-defined rna motifs.

analysis of functional rna motifs and sites in rna sequences can obtain useful information for deciphering rna regulatory mechanisms. our previous work, regrna  <cit> , is widely used to identify regulatory motifs and mirna target sites, and has been cited  <dig> times. however, various types of functional rna motifs and identification approaches were continuously accumulated and developed in recent years. in order to comprehensively identify functional rna motifs, a more complete and updated analysis platform is crucial.

this work presents an integrated web server, regrna  <dig> , for identifying functional rna motifs and sites in an input rna sequence. numerous data sources, such as rfam  <cit> , frnadb  <cit>  and utrsite  <cit> , and identification approaches, such as genesplicer  <cit> , ribosw  <cit>  and rbsfinder  <cit> , were integrated in regrna  <dig> , and other additional information, such as gc-content ratio and rna accessibility, are also presented on the web page. user can submit an rna sequence through our user-friendly interface, and obtain the predictive results with graphical visualization.

RESULTS
a case study of identification of purine riboswitch
the purine riboswitch is used as a case study to demonstrate the capability of regrna  <dig> . purine riboswitches, which are found in the 5'utr of mrnas act as cis-acting genetic regulatory elements composed of a metabolite-responsive aptamer domain in a specific secondary structure. it can regulate both transcription and translation by binding their corresponding targets. additional file  <dig> illustrates a cartoon representation of the mechanism of genetic regulation by the guanine riboswitch  <cit> . in the presence high concentrations of guanine or hypoxanthine, ligand binding stabilizes the three-way junction structure, allowing the mrna to form the terminator element . without ligand binding, the 3'side of the p <dig> stem  and the 5'side of the terminator are used to form an antiterminator element, allowing transcription to continue.

an rna sequence with the accession number of embl, x <dig>  was used as an input for regrna  <dig> . there exist a purine riboswitch and an operon of two genes, b. subtilis xpt and pubx, in x <dig> according to the annotations of rfam and embl database. the total length of x <dig> is  <dig> bps, and the location of purine riboswitch is from position  <dig> to  <dig>  the location of cds regions of xpt and pubx are from position  <dig> to  <dig> and from position  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively.
