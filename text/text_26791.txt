BACKGROUND
molecular chaperones encompass several families, play important physiological roles, some of which essential for life, and are key components of anti-stress mechanisms in all organisms, tissues and cells  <cit> . the hsp <dig> family is thought to be required for various cellular processes and for the response to environmental changes and survival  <cit> . although there is no doubt about the biological and medical importance to the human hsp <dig> chaperone family, a coherent, unifying informational framework encompassing all members, that would facilitate their understanding individually and as a group is lacking. a framework of multiple data pertaining to all family members is necessary for planning future experiments to further elucidate the evolution, synthesis and maturation, structure, functions, trafficking and pathology, of these genes and proteins. likewise, this framework would provide an essential context for interpreting the results and for inferring new properties that can be submitted to experimental testing.

hsp <dig> proteins and their parent genes have been studied in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms chiefly because of their participation in protein folding under normal and stress conditions, and of their potential role in ageing and pathology, e.g., cancer, and apoptosis  <cit> . many hsp <dig> genes have been reported, generating a confusing array of data, variants, and nomenclatures in databases and printed literature. the use of different names for the same hsp <dig> gene and/or protein and the use of the same name for various hsp <dig> genes and/or proteins make interpretation of the reported results very difficult if not impossible. furthermore, in many instances it is not entirely clear if reference is made to the gene or its protein product, and in other instances, it is impossible to know exactly what gene or protein in the family is being considered, since only the word hsp <dig> is used without further clarification.

analyses of hsp <dig> genes at the genome level have been carried out for a few organisms, such as caenorhabditis  <cit> , drosophila  <cit> , and ciona intestinalis  <cit> . an earlier attempt, more than ten years ago, at defining the human hsp <dig> family was based on printed literature searches and yielded  <dig> genes  <cit> . since then, no systematic, comprehensive analysis of human hsp <dig> genes has to our knowledge been published.

in this report, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the extended family of human hsp <dig> genes and their proteins based on genomic, structural, and evolutionary analyses. the overall picture is that of a diversified family of proteins that achieved diversity at various levels: genetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional. the implications of this diversity for function, cell and tissue localization, and pathology can be predicted to be wide and important for life and to have a significant impact on biomedical sciences. the unified and coherent matrix of data we generated pertaining to evolution, genetics, transcription, structure, anatomic distribution, and regulation of the entire human hsp <dig> family should provide a solid context for future studies and for the development of therapeutic means specifically targeted to well-defined family members  <cit> .

RESULTS
human hsp <dig> genes
we carried out extensive literature and database searches and found  <dig> human hsp <dig> proteins with corresponding names and identifiers. similarity analysis of these proteins revealed  <dig> groups of non-identical hsp <dig> sequences, which in turn could be clustered by further analysis into  <dig> groups. from each of these  <dig> groups, we chose a representative sequence to query the human genome ncbi build  <dig>  for conserved and diverged sequences, as described in methods, and we found  <dig> loci encoding hsp70-like sequences. of these sequences,  <dig> corresponded to genes recognized in the genome annotation. another sequence was identified as an hsp <dig> gene, named hspa <dig>  which is transcribed under certain conditions although it is considered by some as a pseudogene . the main characteristics of the  <dig> hsp <dig> genes are shown in table  <dig>  we identified thirty other sequences as belonging to the hsp70-gene family, but they had features such as frame-shifts and in-frame stop codons indicating that they are pseudogenes. the main characteristics of these  <dig> hsp70-related pseudogenes are shown in table  <dig>  the chromosomal distribution of all hsp <dig> genes and pseudogenes is displayed in table  <dig>  the genes and pseudogenes were distributed over  <dig> chromosomes, some of which had both protein-coding genes and pseudogenes, while chromosomes 15– <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had neither. hsp <dig> genes and pseudogenes were distributed among chromosomes irrespective of their evolutionary relations, with the exception of the triad of genes hspa1a, hspa1b, hspa1l, all encoded in close proximity on chromosome  <dig>  and of the pair of genes hspa <dig>  hspa <dig>  encoded near each other on chromosome  <dig>

variants and isoforms
the protein isoforms shown in table  <dig> pertain in the majority of cases to known mrna variants. in the case of hspa <dig>  a transcription product was terminated by a stop codon after  <dig> amino acids. however, a complete conserved hsp <dig> protein of  <dig> amino acids could be encoded bypassing a frame shift at codon position  <dig>  for the hyou <dig> gene, we found four mrna variants two of which using the same translation initiation site, corresponding to three protein isoforms .

besides the described mrna variants indicated in table  <dig>  many more processed variants for the majority of the genes were predicted from the analysis of est  and sage  data. prediction of transcript variants based on these data  are displayed and compared in table  <dig>  which also shows that ecgene and aceview predictions differ considerably. for example, for hspa <dig> at least  <dig> protein variants are predicted by ecgene vs.  <dig> predicted by aceview,  <dig> vs.  <dig> variants are predicted for hspa1a or hspa1b,  <dig> vs.  <dig> are predicted for hyou <dig>   <dig> vs.  <dig> are predicted for hspa <dig>  and similar differences were observed for most of the other genes. these inconsistencies could result from the use of somewhat different datasets, or from different quality-control procedures applied to the est data. in any case, est analysis suggested that there is a significantly greater number of transcript variants and isoforms for hsp <dig> genes than previously suspected.

evolutionary history of the human hsp <dig> genes
we computed phylogenetic trees of the human hsp <dig> genes based on the alignment of their protein products using both distance and maximum-likelihood procedures  obtaining with both methods highly similar results. we excluded from the overall alignment the sequences of hspa12a and hspa12b, which would have significantly reduced the useful size of the alignment. a phylogenetic tree of the proteins encoded by the  <dig> hsp <dig> genes  distinguished seven major evolutionarily related groups, which we defined by a bootstrap-support values over 85%. these groups are indicated in figure  <dig> with brackets. group i was composed of the most diverged sequences, hspa12a and hspa12b, of uncertain relation with other eukaryotic and prokaryotic hsp70s. it had previously been noticed that hspa12a and hspa12b branch in an intermediate position between eukaryotic and prokaryotic hsp <dig> sequences  <cit>  but the origin of these two genes was not investigated further. although conservation of a few sequence motifs clearly identifies these two genes as members of the extended hsp <dig> gene family, their sequence conservation was insufficient to allow for a reliable, accurate determination of their evolutionary position compared to other human hsp70s.

group ii was composed of the mitochondrial protein hspa9b, considered of alphaproteobacterial origin  <cit> , which, accordingly, clustered with the dnak sequence from e. coli  with very high bootstrap support.

group iii encompassed the 105/ <dig> kda proteins hspa <dig>  hspa4l, hsph <dig>  and the more distantly related sequence hyou <dig>  coding for the  <dig> kda protein grp <dig>  hspa <dig> was also related to proteins in group iii but with lower  bootstrap support than that  we adopted to identify closely related sequences as members of a distinct group. therefore, we classified hspa <dig> separately in group iv. also joined to the sequences of groups iii and iv, was the sequence stch, but with considerably lower bootstrap support  than that required to differentiate the groups, and thus we assigned stch to another group, i.e., group v.

group vi was composed of sequences clustered with 100% bootstrap support and, among them, we distinguish three subgroups, one including hspa1a, hspa1b and hspa1l, a second including hspa <dig> and hspa <dig>  and a third including hspa <dig> and hspa <dig> 

group vii included sequence hspa <dig>  expressed in the endoplasmic-reticulum , which was joined to group vi with lower bootstrap support  than the minimum adopted for distinguishing the main groups.

we considered the sequences from groups ii , vi  and vii  typical hsp <dig> proteins because they had conserved atp-binding and substrate-binding domains . in contrast, we considered the sequences in all the other groups atypical because they had in what would be the sbd of the typical hsp <dig> molecules no equivalent of this domain, or incomplete or highly diverged equivalents.

origin and evolution of the human hsp70-related pseudogenes
an evolutionary tree of the proteins that would be encoded by the pseudogenes identified in this work in relation to the proteins encoded in the  <dig> hsp <dig> genes is shown in figure  <dig>  we included in the tree the  <dig> less corrupted sequences out of the  <dig> pseudogenes. the evolutionary tree indicates that the vast majority of the hsp <dig> pseudogenes originated from hspa <dig>  we also identified the hsp <dig> sequence most similar to each of the  <dig> pseudogenes. the results are shown in table  <dig> also in comparison to sequence characterizations for the pseudogenes available at the pseudogene database  <cit> . twenty-three of the  <dig> pseudogenes were predicted in the pseudogene database, while seven pseudogenes were not and are newly reported here.

aabbreviations and symbols: pseudogenes with a predicted pseudocoding region ≥  <dig> aa are called p, and those shorter than  <dig> aa are called f ; pd, pseudogene database  <cit> ; type pd, predicted pseudogene type as per the pseudogene database; ori pd, pseudogene origin as per the pseudogene database; ori, pseudogene origin determined in this work, based on phylogenetic-tree branching  and based on similarity with the closest sequence ; sim, percent similarity ; p, processed ; a, ambiguous; d, duplicated.

phylogenetic analysis of the most conserved pseudogenes and detailed comparison of the most corrupted ones with the closest sequence among the  <dig> hsp <dig> genes, revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> pseudogenes originated from the hspa <dig>  two from hspa9b, and one from hspa <dig> .

exon/intron structure of the human hsp <dig> genes
the number of exons for each gene are shown in table  <dig>  and a detailed characterization of the genome position and length of each exon is shown in table s <dig>  additional file  <dig>  an analysis of the exon/intron structure of these genes provided important insights into their evolutionary relations. with the exception of all but one of the genes in group vi , all hsp <dig> genes are multiexonic, ranging from a minimum of five exons in stch up to  <dig> exons in hyou <dig>  details on the intron-exon structure of individual gene sequences and their relations within and between the hsp <dig> groups are provided below.

group i
the two similar sequences hspa12a and hspa12b possessed an identical exon-intron structure with  <dig> exons within the coding region . hspa12b also possessed an intron in its 5' utr region. the hspa12a and hspa12b proteins were quite dissimilar from the other hsp <dig> sequences and, within the few regions of homology we found no splice site in common with sequences from other groups.

groups ii, vi and vii 
sequences from groups ii, vi, and vii included typical hsp <dig> sequences expressed, respectively, in the mitochondrion, cytosol/nucleus, and er. the genes hspa1a, hspa1b and hspa1l  from group vi are positioned within the mhc-iii region on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , and are intronless. in fact, among the genes in group vi, only hspa <dig> possessed multiple exons  within the coding region. we compared the splice positions in hspa <dig> , hspa <dig>  and hspa9b , and found a splice site conserved within one codon position in hspa <dig>  and hspa <dig> , and we also found one splice site conserved within two codon positions between hspa8- <dig>  and hspa9b .

group iii
within group iii , the closely related hspa <dig>  hspa4l and hsph <dig> sequences conserved a common exon-intron structure of 18– <dig> exons, further supporting the cohesiveness of this group. among these sequences, hsph <dig> was distinguished by fusion of the exons labeled vii and viii of hspa <dig> and hspa4l into a single exon named vii , with an apparent intron-loss/intron-insertion event in the subgroup. a remarkable feature of the exon-intron structure of this subgroup was that most splice sites and all of the last seven splice sites  were between codons . within group iii, hyou <dig> was the most distantly related. it included  <dig> splice sites, of which  <dig>  were within the coding region. ten of these sites were within the abd . one splice site was conserved throughout all sequences in group iii . six other splice sites were either in close proximity  or bordering diverged inserted elements. besides the abd region, hyou <dig> shared similarity with other sequences of group iii in a short segment immediately following the abd and mostly within a region of about  <dig> codons between positions  <dig> and  <dig>  this relatively conserved region included five splice sites in hyou <dig> as well as in hspa <dig>  hspa4l, and hsph <dig>  one of these five splice sites was conserved among all sequences . in conclusion, by comparing hyou <dig> splice sites with those of the other members of group iii, we recognized two conserved splice sites  in this group. we also found a few other splice sites in close proximity within conserved sequence elements or in correspondence to inserted/deleted elements.

we compared group iii with other sequences  and showed a splice site in homologous positions in hspa <dig>  hspa4l, and hsph <dig>  and in the mitochondrial gene hspa9b . also, we found a splice site between codons  <dig> and  <dig> in hspa4l within two homologous codon positions  of a corresponding splice site in hspa <dig> isoform  <dig> 

groups iv and v
group iv  was composed of one sequence, hspa <dig>  which in the phylogenetic tree shown in figure  <dig> was associated to group iii with bootstrap support 81%, marginally below the threshold of bootstrap support  that we chose to define evolutionary groups. within the coding regions of hspa14-a there were  <dig> splice sites . in hspa14-a, we found a splice site within codon  <dig> in a position homologous to a splice site in hyou <dig> . a second splice site of hspa14-a, within codon  <dig>  was homologous to a corresponding splice site in hspa4l  and closely related sequences. a third splice site, positioned after codon  <dig> of hspa14-a, coincided with a splice site in a homologous position in hspa <dig>  and in stch , although weak conservation in this region made the alignment less reliable. a splice site of hspa14-a at codon  <dig> was within a short variable region in which splice sites occurred also in hyou <dig>  and in hspa9b . finally, a splice site within codon  <dig>  of hspa14-a was within one homologous codon of another splice site in hspa9b .

the stch  gene had  <dig> splice sites in its coding region. since stch was weakly associated  in the phylogenetic tree to the sequences of group iii and to hspa <dig> , it was interesting to see whether some similarities in the exon-intron patterns of these sequences could be detected but we did not detect any common splice site associating stch  to group iii. however, we did find a splice site in common among stch , hspa14-a , and hspa <dig> .

evolution of eukaryotic hsp <dig> sequences
we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of eukaryotic typical hsp70s, including the human ones , and  <dig> other typical sequences from completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes. the tree is shown in figure s <dig>  additional file  <dig>  in which all branches with bootstrap support < 40% have been collapsed into multi-partitions. the tree constructed using all the information available, did not have sufficient resolution to discern most of the ancient phylogenetic relations. however, the tree did provide several important pieces of information. for example, thirty-three eukaryotic mitochondrial sequences clustered with the e. coli dnak in a separate group, which roots the tree of other eukaryotic sequences. apart from a few protist sequences of uncertain origin and a sequence from microsporidia , the cluster of er proteins, including protists, plants, fungi, and animals  separated early, as in the trees of human sequences , indicating that the separation of er and cytosolic sequences happened early in the evolution of eukaryotes. the cytosolic sequences presented several lineages of uncertain relations , many involving sequences from protists, two from fungi and a third set from plants. a major cluster of sequences with weak bootstrap support  included all human cytosolic sequences. within this cluster, two subclusters with relatively high support  included, respectively, the human hspa <dig> and hspa <dig>  a third cluster with lower support  included hspa1a, hspa1b and hspa1l.

we also studied the evolutionary relations of all human hsp <dig> proteins  with prokaryotic dnak proteins, resulting in the evolutionary tree displayed in figure  <dig> that shows the close relation of hspa9b  with alpha-proteobacterial sequences. the tree also suggests that all other human hsp <dig> genes originated and differentiated from a unique prokaryotic ancestor of uncertain identity.

evolution of hspa12
we also searched for the genes encoding proteins like hspa12a and hspa12b in the sequenced genomes examined in figure  <dig>  we found homologs of these genes only in fish , amphibian , bird , and mammal , a finding that together with their evolutionary relations shown in figure  <dig>  suggests that the various hspa <dig> genes evolved at an early stage in the evolution of vertebrates . we found in danio rerio  three recently diverged copies of the gene  that were quite diverged from the human and amphibian sequences . chicken had only one copy, which was most similar to the human hspa12b , whereas we found two copies of this gene in mammals and amphibians. the evolutionary tree of the gene suggests that the amphibian and mammalian copies resulted from a unique duplication event that occurred in the tetrapod lineage before the radiation of the amphibian and mammalian lineages. within each of the one amphibian and two mammals examined, the two gene copies had similarities in the range 61–65%. each paralog was quite conserved among the three groups, with similarities between mammals and amphibian of 82–83% for the hspa12a paralog, and of 71–73% for the hspa12b paralog, whereas between human and mouse similarities were 97% and 94%, respectively. the phylogenetic relations of the vertebrate lineages imply that one of the two copies of the gene has been lost from the chicken genome. interestingly, we identified in the chicken genome a non-annotated sequence of  <dig> nt  in the complementary strand, encoding a protein with  <dig> % identity to a segment of the annotated chicken hspa <dig> gene. this short gene is possibly a remnant of hspa12a.

hsp <dig> proteins: structural domain characteristics of the groups and subgroups
conserved and unique sequence elements of the different members of the human hsp <dig> protein family were identified and are schematically displayed in figure  <dig>  hsp <dig> proteins typically comprise two major domains: an atp-binding domain  and a substrate-binding domain . most of the abd of the human hspa1a  has been resolved by crystallography  <cit> , pdb identifier 1s3x, and most of the sbd of the rat hspa <dig>  has been elucidated by nmr  <cit> , pdb identifier 1ckr. the positions of the sequences corresponding to the solved structures of the abd and sbd domains are shown in figure  <dig> aligned to the corresponding sequence domains conserved among the human hsp <dig> proteins, drawn as white boxes. other domains conserved among groups or subgroups of sequences are shown as aligned boxes of matching colors.

the abd was conserved in most proteins; segments of it were present in all of them, thus providing one parameter for recognizing them as members of the hsp <dig> family. we found variants of abd in the two subgroups of group iii distinguished by high bootstrap support, namely the hspa4-hspa4l-hsph <dig> subgroup, and the hyou <dig> subgroup, with regions of differentiation and inserted elements  in correspondence to exposed loops in the crystal structure of hspa1a . in hspa12a and hspa12b , most of the abd was highly divergent, with scattered conserved regions that allowed their identification as members of the extended hsp <dig> protein family. an incomplete abd was present in hspa14-b , and in hspa4-b .

the sbd was considerably less conserved than the abd. for example, the typical sbd as observed in hspa <dig> was entirely conserved only in the sequences of groups ii, vi, and vii. a c-terminal portion of proteins in groups vi and vii of about  <dig> amino acids, comprising the  <dig> c-terminal residues included in the crystal structure and  <dig> residues not included in the crystal structure, shown in yellow in figure  <dig>  was found in the proteins of group iii . in all of these proteins, this sequence segment was interrupted by a long insertion characteristic of group iii, somewhat differentiated in the hspa4l and hspa4-a sequences in which it is shown in greenish yellow, compared to hyou <dig> in which it is shown in brownish. in contrast, we did not find in the proteins of group i any sequence similarity to the sbd of group vi sequences.

other noteworthy findings are listed below :

1) hspa8- <dig> and hspa14-a had only a partial, n-terminal sequence of the sbd;

2) the hspa <dig> and hsph <dig> subgroups were characterized by distinctive domains  different from the abd and sbd. hyou <dig> had inserted long, unique elements  that separated shorter regions of homology to the sbd of group vi;

3) the sequence c-terminal to the part of sbd resolved in the rat hspa <dig> structure  was not conserved in hspa9b, in which it was instead more similar to the corresponding prokaryotic sequence of dnak ;

4) hspa12a and hspa12b  had, as mentioned earlier, portions  of the canonical abd typical of the other groups , but did not share any similarity with their sbd;

5) the abd of stch was characterized by a long insertion of  <dig> aa  that substituted residues 285– <dig> of hspa1a, corresponding to a loop connecting two beta-strands in the apical part of one of the two atp-binding jaws of the abd. this inserted element was not predicted to have an ordered secondary structure . an unrelated inserted element in the same position was present in hspa9b . a more extended region of divergence occurred in the same region also in hspa12a and b, in which positions 278– <dig>  of hspa1a were substituted by a diverged element of  <dig> aa . these changes may reflect functional differentiation endowing the hspa <dig> proteins with specific capabilities not shared with other hsp70s.

6) another major region of differentiation corresponded to positions 211– <dig> of hspa1a , which were substituted by a diverged segment of  <dig> aa in hyou <dig> . a shorter overlapping peptide within the same region  was diverged in other group iii sequences . an insertion of four aa  was present in hyou <dig>  inserted in correspondence to positions  <dig> and  <dig> of hspa1a. these positions are part of an alpha-helix whose structure most likely influences the atp-binding site's architecture and thereby its functionality.

7) still another region that was modified in all atypical hsp70s  corresponded to positions 189– <dig> of hspa1a , in which this short segment of four aa was substituted by longer loops  in the hspa <dig> and hsph <dig> subgroups and in the hyou <dig> subgroup . the same region represents the c-terminal part of a longer segment of  <dig> aa  substituted by a long inserted element of  <dig> aa in hspa12a and hspa12b . while positions 189– <dig> formed an exposed loop in hspa1a, the longer peptide of  <dig> aa involved more substantial structural elements, including an extended loop followed by a mostly-buried alpha-helix.

8) the interaction of hsp <dig> proteins with hsp <dig> proteins is mediated by the adaptor protein hop, whose tpr <dig> domain specifically recognizes an hsp <dig> c-terminal tpr <dig> domain-binding site  <cit> . this site was conserved in the sequences of group vi, in hspa4l, in hspa <dig> , and in hsph <dig> , ending with the acidic-aliphatic-acidic triad evd, evd, did and dld, respectively. this finding suggests that the functions of the hsp70s just mentioned include interacting with hsp <dig>  in contrast, we did not find the tpr <dig> domain-binding site in hspa <dig>  hspa9b, stch, hspa <dig>  hyou <dig>  hspa12a, or hspa12b.

9) in stch, a sequence segment in close proximity to the c-terminus of the abd  was shown to be involved in interactions with the ubiquitin-system proteins chap <dig> and chap <dig>  <cit> . this peptide corresponds to positions 411– <dig> of the stch sequence. its homologous positions 343– <dig> in the hspa1a structure  <cit>  correspond to an exposed extended loop  anchored by two surrounding alpha-helices. the ubp  was conserved in all human hsp70s with the exceptions of hspa12a and b, in which only the n-terminal alpha-helix sequence was somewhat recognizable. this conservation was particularly evident in the typical hsp70s , in which the ubps had similarities of 54–64% with the stch counterpart, suggesting that functions associated with the ubiquitin proteasome system  are shared by the majority of hsp <dig> proteins, including atypical ones.

10) consistent with their localization in the er, we identified er-import signal peptides in hspa <dig>  stch and hyou <dig> isoforms  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . an er-retention signal was identified in hspa <dig> and in hyou <dig> isoforms  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  but not in the microsome-associated protein stch.

patterns of hsp <dig> gene expression in tissues, developmental stages, and cellular compartments
the expression levels of hsp <dig> genes in various tissues can be estimated by assessing the relative number of ests per tissue type. summary results on the frequency of human hsp <dig> gene ests per tissue type obtained from the ncbi unigene database  <cit>  are displayed in table  <dig>  noteworthy were the relatively very high expression levels of hspa <dig> and hspa1a in vascular tissue and in the spleen, respectively. at the opposite end of the spectrum, the expression levels of hspa1l and hspa12b were very low, or undetectable in the majority of tissues examined. all genes were expressed each in only one tissue at much higher levels than in the other tissues, with one exception, hspa12a, which was preferentially expressed in two tissues, parathyroid and nerve. these findings suggest that accurate determination of gene regulation and protein function for different hsp <dig> paralogs should be experimentally investigated for each pertinent tissue and that findings pertaining to a tissue must not be assumed to apply to other tissues.

we also obtained data on expression of hsp <dig> genes at successive developmental stages  . the results indicated that most hsp <dig> paralogs are preferentially expressed at specific developmental stages. seven genes  were expressed at their highest levels in juvenile tissues , three genes  were expressed at their highest levels in the embryo, three genes  were most expressed in the neonate , only two genes  were most expressed in adult tissue , and one gene  was equally expressed, at very low levels, in the embryo and in the adult and was undetectable in the neonate and juvenile tissues.

we obtained data on the mode of expression of hsp <dig> genes and the locale of residence of their proteins as shown in table  <dig>  ten of the  <dig> genes studied were expressed constitutively, and out of these  <dig> genes five were expressed only constitutively . only one gene was not constitutively expressed, and nine genes were stress inducible.

discussion
multiple genes and mrna variants: hsp <dig> diversity
we identified in the human genome  <dig> genes  encoding proteins of the extended hsp <dig> family. this count includes one putative gene, hspa <dig>  transcribed after a 45°c heat shock in fibroblasts  <cit>  but also proposed to be a pseudogene transcribed only under particular conditions  <cit> . this list considerably expands the count of  <dig> genes resulting from a "pre-genomic" attempt at a comprehensive classification of human hsp <dig> genes  <cit>  and resizes a recent list of  <dig> putative genes  <cit>  collected from public databases, which included four pseudogene sequences. at least five genes are characterized by multiple mrna variants and protein isoforms. we also identified in the human genome  <dig> hsp <dig> pseudogenes , most of which  we determined originated from the gene hspa <dig> 

our sequence and domain comparisons show that the hsp <dig> family is defined by its unique atp-binding domain , conserved in all of its members with the exception of the two hspa <dig> genes, where the abd is more divergent but still recognizable. within the abd we have identified sequence insertions, most of which uniquely characterize sequences from group iii . these regions are interesting targets for future functional characterization studies. in contrast to the substantial conservation of the abd, the substrate-binding domain  has greatly diversified among the various hsp <dig> groups, including complete or partial loss respectively in stch and hspa <dig>  significant sequence divergence and insertion of novel sequence elements in group iii genes, and complete domain substitution in the group i sequences . the extent of sequence divergence, exemplified by substitution or loss within the sbd, suggests that the hsp70-like proteins belonging to groups i, iii, iv, and v are likely to have evolved structures and functions in the sbd domain that are not necessarily associated to the classic hydrophobic peptide-recognition mechanism of the typical hsp <dig> sequences of groups ii, vi and vii.

we also characterized presence or absence of protein-protein interaction sequence motifs in different family members, indicating which members can be predicted to participate in certain interaction networks. for example, we found that the tpr <dig> domain-binding motif  <cit>  , mediating interaction of hsp <dig> with hsp <dig>  was conserved in all the sequences of group vi and in hspa4l, hspa <dig> and hsph <dig>  strongly suggesting a functional relation of these proteins through their interaction with hsp <dig>  in contrast, the motif was absent in hspa <dig>  hspa9b, stch, hspa <dig>  hyou <dig>  hspa12a, or hspa12b, suggesting in this respect a different role for these proteins in the human interactome. in a similar vein, we identified in most hsp <dig> sequences  a ubiquitin-binding peptide  previously described only in stch  <cit> , suggesting that all typical and the majority of the atypical hsp <dig> proteins are involved in the ubiquitin system and protein-degradation pathways.

analyses of est data suggest that some hsp <dig> genes may express an impressively high number of mrna variants and protein isoforms . to what extent these variants correspond to proteins with distinct functions and/or disparate mechanisms of action, or to transcriptional errors, remains to be established. in any case, the results indicate that many more hsp <dig> gene transcripts and protein variants than previously suspected may be expressed in human cells. this suggests that the use of alternative forms of gene expression, either through different transcription initiation and/or translation initiation sites or alternative splicing, may be a phenomenon significantly more important than previously recognized in generating the many functionalities of the hsp <dig> family in the various tissues and cell compartments. the different functionalities that may be generated through these mechanisms are exemplified by the hyou <dig> gene. two transcript variants of this gene are generated from two alternative transcription-initiation sites corresponding to alternative first exons 1a and 1b of different lengths but with the same translation-initiation site. a  <dig> bp cis-acting element overlaps the 5' end of exon 1a and is involved in hypoxic stress-dependent induction of the alternative transcript that begins with exon 1b, resulting in increased accumulation of the protein in the er  <cit> . in a third transcription variant, starting within what is exon  <dig> of the transcripts mentioned above, a different protein isoform is produced with translation-initiation within exon  <dig>  lacking the er-import signal peptide. this variant is thought to have housekeeping functions in the cytosol  <cit> . the elucidation of the significance of the known and predicted mrna variants of hsp <dig> genes would be of great importance for understanding the various functions of hsp <dig> proteins in all cellular compartments, tissues, and developmental stages under diverse environmental conditions.

evolution, groups, and subgroups of human hsp70
their great diversity notwithstanding, human hsp70s can be sorted into evolutionarily related clusters. early analyses based on sequences of eight typical hsp <dig> proteins from yeast and other typical hsp <dig> proteins from plants and animals, including one from humans, showed that typical hsp <dig> genes cluster in four evolutionary groups that are respectively characterized by expression in cytoplasm, er, mitochondria or plastids  <cit> . our phylogenetic analysis revealed that the  <dig> human hsp70s characterized in this work belong to seven major groups , confirmed by other sequence features, such as "signature sequences"  and exon-intron gene structure, and correlated with other data . the phylogenetic tree of the human hsp70s of about  <dig> kda molecular weight unveiled three major evolutionary events: firstly, two genes with products of molecular weight around  <dig> kda converged into a primordial eukaryotic organism, one derived from an alphaproteobacterium, from which hspa9b of mitochondrial origin derived, and one, of unrecognized prokaryotic origin, corresponding to the nuclear gene progenitor of hspa <dig> and hspa5; secondly, the nuclear gene most likely first duplicated into two genes, one specialized to the cytosol/nucleus , and one specialized to the er ; thirdly, the gene specialized to the cytosol/nucleus later multiplied into a multigene family  represented in humans by six or seven genes  and at least  <dig> pseudogenes .

within group vi, only the coding region of hspa <dig> was encoded by multiple exons , whereas the coding regions of all other genes are encoded within a single exon . similarly, most pseudogenes associated to hspa <dig> did not show signs of exon-intron structures. this suggests that the sequences of group vi and related pseudogenes were all derived from hspa <dig> by retrotransposition. the impressive retrotransposition activity  involving hspa <dig> is also consistent with the very high level of expression of this gene in comparison with the other members of the hsp <dig> family. the multi-exon structure of all other genes suggests instead that sets of similar sequences  were generated by duplication events.

the evolutionary history of hspa1a, hspa1b and hspa1l has been analyzed in detail in the past  <cit>  and revisited more recently  <cit> . the three genes are clustered with the same organizational structure in the human and mouse genomes, strongly suggesting that their duplication happened before the separation of the rodent and primate lineages. the phylogenetic trees, however, suggest that hspa1a and hspa1b resulted from independent duplications in human and mouse. this apparent contradiction can be interpreted to be the result of gene transformation between hspa1a and hspa1b occurring independently in human and mouse.

the human hspa <dig> and hspa <dig> sequences do not significantly cluster with any other animal protein. this result is consistent with an early separation of hspa6/ <dig> and the common progenitor of hspa <dig>  hspa <dig> and hspa <dig>  probably predating the evolution of vertebrates. the presence of sequences from fish and amphibians in the lineage of hspa <dig> and the absence of a sequence from fish in the lineages of hspa <dig> and hspa <dig> suggests that hspa <dig> and hspa <dig> originated from hspa <dig> early in the evolution of the tetrapod lineage, with the exclusion of fish, although homologs of these genes might be found in danio rerio among the many hsp <dig> genes of unresolved origin.

less well defined is the origin of the atypical human hsp70-like proteins, comprising two lighter sequences , hspa <dig> and stch, the first associated to ribosomes and the second expressed in microsomes, and of the heavier 105/ <dig> kda hspa <dig>  hspa4l, hsph <dig> proteins and  <dig> kda hyou <dig> protein . however, the greater similarity of these sequences to the typical human hsp <dig> product compared to the prokaryotic dnak proteins suggests that these genes also originated from a common progenitor of the typical nuclear eukaryotic genes from a gene duplication that predated the proliferation of the hsp70-typical gene sequences. also uncertain is the evolutionary position of hspa12a and hspa12b, which conserve only sparse similarity to the atp-binding domain of typical human hsp <dig> proteins, and are marginally more similar to prokaryotic dnak  <cit> . we found that the evolutionary relations of these multiexon sequences are not clarified by their gene structure. in fact, whereas the positions of the splice sites within each group were generally conserved, we found very few conserved splice sites when comparing sequences from different groups.

CONCLUSIONS
the human hsp70-gene family is in the main the result of multiple duplications facilitated by frequent retrotransposition events of a single highly expressed gene, hspa <dig>  human hsp <dig> proteins can be clustered into seven distinct evolutionary groups, many of which are characterized by highly divergent c-terminal  domains. hence, functional specificities of the various hsp <dig> proteins are likely to be associated to the functional properties of their c-terminal domains. in addition, other noticeable differences in the nucleotide-binding n-terminal domain of the various hsp70s may also affect the functional role of these proteins.

overall, the results revealed an evolutionary diversity at genetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional levels that generated a multiplicity of structures, functions, regulation modes, and anatomic locations of hsp70s, predicting a wide array of roles in cell physiology and pathogenesis.

a thorough classification of all the members of the hsp <dig> gene family encoded in the genome is an essential step towards their unambiguous functional characterization. the identification of the chaperonopathies  <cit>  has made more pressing the need for a better characterization of these genes in order to pinpoint with accuracy the gene-proteins involved, understand pathogenetic mechanisms, and devise diagnostic and therapeutic means. bioinformatics analyses of evolutionary relations and sequence features of the numerous hsp <dig> paralogs found in the human genome suggest many interesting avenues of experimental studies  and provide the basis for selecting the most efficient molecule for use in chaperonotherapy or the most appropriate target  for anti-chaperone agents.
