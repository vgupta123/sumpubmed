BACKGROUND
ochrobactrum anthropi  is a non-fermenting, aerobic, gram-negative bacillus that exhibits widespread resistance to β-lactam antibiotics  <cit>  and is able to colonize a variety of environments, namely soil, plants, insects, animals and humans  <cit> . reports of opportunistic/nosocomial infections caused by o. anthropi have been increasing over the last decade  <cit> , and the ability of o. anthropi to adhere to silicone may play a role in catheter-associated infections  <cit> . furthermore, o. anthropi populations may adapt in response to habitat and host interactions, as previously described in human clinical isolates  <cit> . in the human infection: a catheter-associated bacteremia caused by o. anthropi has been shown  <cit> . in literature, the infections due to o. anthropi involved catheter related bacteremia, whereas endophalmitis, urinary infections, meningitis, endocarditis, hepatic, pelvic and pancreatic abscess often as monomicrobial infection have been reported  <cit> 

according to their habitat, the population structure of o. anthropi varied. for example, biological and genomic microdiversity was higher in bulk soil than in the rhizoshere  <cit> . authors related this difference in diversity level to the expansion of clones adapted to metabolites produced by rhizodeposition  <cit> .

among the few publications regarding the known methods for typing of o. anthropi relevant papers are those from romano et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  dealing with mlst and pfge. also, bathe et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  described the rep-pcr of o. anthropi . finally, bizzini et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  reported on maldi-tof characterization of o. anthropi.

the different typing methods used, mainly rep-pcr and maldi-tof, in terms of time, accuracy and costs may allow to obtain more timely, accurate results with higher resolution among the different strains involved in hospital outbreak. when this infection did occur in our hospital, we set out to study the identification and typing of the twentythree o. anthropi strains. strain typing was carried out by automated repetitive extragenic palindromic-polymerase chain reaction  and by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis . proteome profiling was performed through matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight .

the application of accurate and more powerful techniques, used for typing, should be encouraged for monitoring the spread of bacteria and nosocomial infection control.

methods
bacterial strains and microbiological methods
during a 4-month period   <dig> o. anthropi strains were isolated from samples of  <dig> patients admitted to the catanzaro university hospital  oncology o.u. samples were taken as part of standard patient care and all procedures were approved by the local ethics committee at the medical faculty of the university “magna graecia” of catanzaro, which are in compliance with declaration of helsinki .

during stay in hospital, all patients, which presented severe background disease, mainly neoplasia, showed mild clinical signs of sepsis. we therefore performed blood cultures by bact/alert 3d system , detecting  <dig> isolates from  <dig> positive blood cultures drawn from the central venous catheter  and  <dig> isolates from positive catheter tip cultures . the strains were conventionally identified by typical gram stain morphology and biochemical testing . antibiotic sensitivity was evaluated by vitek system . to exclude brucella misdiagnosis, the o. anthropi colonies of all isolates were tested with brucella agglutinating sera .

rep-pcr-based dna fingerprinting by the diversilab system
for rep-pcr analysis, bacteria  were grown on columbia blood agar; dna was extracted from a 10-μl loopful of each o. anthropi colony, using an ultraclean microbial dna isolation kit . the extracted dna was amplified using a diversilab generic dna fingerprinting kit , following the manufacturer’s instructions. diversilab rep-pcr was performed according to treviño m. et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . briefly, 50 ng of genomic dna,  <dig>  u of amplitaq dna polymerase, and  <dig>  μl of 10× pcr buffer  were added to the appropriate rep-pcr master mix to achieve a total of 25 μl. thermal cycling parameters were as follows: initial denaturation at 94°c for 2 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°c for 30 s, annealing at 60°c for 30 s, extension at 70°c for 90 s, and final extension at 70°c for 3 min. dna concentration was measured by nanodrop  <dig> spectrophotometer . the amplified product was stored at -20°c until detection. analysis of rep-pcr products was performed using a diversilab system, in which the amplified fragments of various sizes and intensities are separated and detected using a microfluidic labchip by an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer . the relatedness of the isolates was analysed by means of the diversilab software, version  <dig> , using the pearson correlation coefficient, to determine distance matrices, and the unweighted-pair group method with arithmetic mean . further analysis was performed by the kullback–leibler distance correlation coefficient.

in general, “different” was defined as <95% pattern similarity and  <dig> or more band differences for organisms defined as homogeneous, and three or more band differences for organisms defined as heterogeneous. “similar” was defined as >95% and < <dig> % pattern similarity and one band difference for homogeneous organisms, or up to two band differences for heterogeneous organisms. “indistinguishable” was defined as >97% pattern similarity and no band differences, including no variation in the intensities of individual bands, although overall intensities may differ  <cit> .

genotyping by pfge
the  <dig> o. anthropi isolates were grown overnight and suspended in se buffer . the cell suspensions  were mixed with an equal volume of 2% low-melting point agarose, moulded into plugs at 4°c, and lysed with lysis buffer  supplemented with proteinase k . the dna contained in each plug was digested by  <dig> u of spei restriction enzyme in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. macrorestriction fragments were separated using the chef-dr iii pfge system  at 10°c for 20 h, at a field strength of 6 v/cm, with an initial switch time of 5 s and a final switch time of 35 s. a lambda ladder of phage dna concatemers was used as a size marker. o. anthropi atcc 49188 t and o. intermedium lmg 3301 t were also genotyped by pfge, and fragment patterns were compared according to the criteria described by tenover  <cit> .

maldi-tof ms and data analysis
a single colony grown overnight on tsi  agar was spotted in duplicate onto the maldi target  plate;  and air-dried at room temperature. after air-drying, each spot was overlaid with 1 μl of hcca  matrix solution saturated with organic solvent  and air-dried completely before maldi-tof ms. maldi-tof ms was carried out using a maldi microflex lt. peptide mass fingerprint product ion spectra were acquired in linear positive mode at a laser frequency of 20 hz, within a mass range from  <dig> to  <dig> 000 da. for each spectrum,  <dig> laser shots were automatically acquired in  <dig> shot steps from different positions of the target spot  using autoxecute acquisition control software . the spectra were externally calibrated using the standard calibrant mixture . to identify unknown bacteria, each peak list generated was matched directly against reference libraries . unknown spectra were compared with a library of reference spectra by means of a pattern-recognition algorithm making use of peak position, peak intensity distributions and peak frequencies. maldi-tof identifications were classified using modified versions of the score values proposed by the manufacturer: a score ≥ <dig> indicated species identification, a score in the range  <dig> - <dig>  indicated genus identification, and a score < <dig>  denotes no identification. for the phylogenetic data analysis, a total of  <dig> spectra were automatically acquired with the autoxecute acquisition control software for each strain . msp creation was carried out with the default setting of the biotyper software . each minimum spanning trees  was assigned to its specific node on the taxonomy tree. in order to visualize the relationship between the msps, dendrogram clustering was carried out using the standard settings of maldi biotyper software version  <dig>  . in addition, to evaluate the spectral variation within each strain, the composite correlation index  was computed by loading the raw data into the biotyper software  <cit> .

RESULTS
phenotype analysis
all isolated strains exhibited the same biochemical pattern  and presented an overlapping antimicrobial susceptibility profile – they were all sensitive to gentamicin , tobramycin , amikacin , ciprofloxacin , levofloxacin , imipenem , and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim , and resistant to ampicillin , ampicillin/sulbactam , cefazolin , cefepime , cefoxitine , ceftazidime , ceftriaxone , piperacillin/tazobactam  and nitrofurantoin . the negative brucella agglutination sera test supported the biochemical identification.

rep-pcr-based dna fingerprinting
genome fingerprinting was carried out using the diversilab system , which uses two interpretation criteria: pearson correlation, based on the intensity of electrophoretic bands, and kullbach correlation, focused on the height and width of the peaks. rep-pcr analysis identified four different patterns, as shown in the dendrogram in figure  <dig> . three rep-pcr patterns clustered isolates with 97% or more pattern similarity, and a further strain, cz <dig>  showed a pattern of similarity of < 95%. this strain showed a correlation index of  <dig> % when compared with strain cz <dig>  isolated from a different site in the same patient. pearson correlation, associated to chronological evaluation of the clinical isolates, showed that strains found during the first timespan  exhibited an overlap between  <dig> and 99%, and were included in two different clusters . during the following timespan, up to the date of last bacterial isolation , strain similarity was higher than 99%; accordingly these bacteria were grouped in a single cluster . unlike strains cz <dig> and cz <dig>  bacterial strains isolated from the same patients from two different sites were similar or indistinguishable when their genome fingerprints were compared. in particular, cz <dig> and cz <dig> strains overlap by 99%, cz <dig> and cz <dig> by 96% and cz <dig> and  <dig> by  <dig> %. a similar behaviour was noted between strains cz <dig> and cz <dig>  . in addition, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  panel b, all clinical strains investigated showed a pattern of similarity lower than  <dig> % and  <dig> % when compared to o. anthropi atcc 49188 t and o. intermedium lmg 3301 t respectively. kullback–leibler analysis showed that the strains obtained later on in the outbreak, particularly 40 days after the first isolation, presented an inter-correlation greater than 92% .

pfge data
the  <dig> strains of o. anthropi were typed by digestion of the chromosomal dna with spei endonuclease, and fragment separation was obtained by pfge. each pattern consisted of approximately 10– <dig> fragments, which were found to be identical to each other, except for strain cz  <dig>  whose 10–15-fragment pattern featured 6– <dig> fragment differences respect to the other pattern in the region between  <dig>  and  <dig> kbp. pfge analysis thereby detected 22/ <dig> unique pulsotypes with a high degree of inter-relatedness. o. anthropi atcc 49188 t and o. intermedium lmg 3301 t appeared different from the  <dig> clinical isolates when compared according to tenover’s criteria .

maldi-tof ms data
a total of  <dig> spectra representing the  <dig> strains of o. anthropi were generated with the automated maldi-tof ms measurement. protein mass patterns were detected in the mass range 2000– <dig>  da, were matched against bruker daltonics reference library, which included three o. anthropi atcc strains, and resulted correctly identified at the species level . in order to create reliable msps for phylogenetic analysis, we measured a total of  <dig> spectra,  <dig> for each strain. each mass spectrum dataset was compared with the others, yielding a matrix of cross-wise relatedness computed with the default setting provided by biotyper  <dig>  . a cci value approaching  <dig>  showed confirmation of the set of spectra at a high level of significance, and is shown in figure  <dig> by the brown squares at the diagonal intersection of the samples . inter-sample comparisons showed decreasing colour to yellow–blue, corresponding to decreasing degrees of correlation down to  <dig> , the lowest match. composite correlation index analysis for the  <dig> ochrobactrum anthropi strains showed similar inter-strain relatedness . strains cz <dig> and cz <dig>  as well as strains cz <dig> and cz <dig>  isolated from the same patients but from two different sites, shared high degrees of similarity . lower similarity, ranging from  <dig> to 80%, was found among strains cz <dig>  cz <dig> and cz <dig>  also isolated from two different sites in the same patient. strains cz  <dig>  cz <dig> and cz <dig> showed the lowest degree of similarity with other strains . at the other end of the scale, two strain clusters  shared a high degree of similarity .

based on the cci data, a score-orientated msp dendrogram was generated using the default setting of biotyper  <dig> , and included the  <dig> clinical strains and the  <dig> atcc strains in the database . according to their mass signals and intensities, a hierarchic dendrogram clustered the  <dig> strains of o. anthropi in a single group, between  <dig> and  <dig> distance levels phylogenetically distinct from the atcc isolates present in database. the dendrogram also revealed the presence of four subgroups, each comprising the strains clustering at less than  <dig> distance levels, thereby indicating a high similarity between the isolates. strains cz <dig> and cz <dig> were grouped in the same cluster with a distance level of up to  <dig>  as were strains cz <dig> and cz <dig>  conversely, strains cz <dig> and cz <dig> were grouped in a different cluster, at a distance level greater than  <dig>  strain cz <dig>  which showed a 60% similarity with the other strains isolated from the same patient, was grouped at an inter-strain distance level of 10– <dig> 

discussion
o. anthropi is an adaptable bacterial species, whose individual strains can thrive in different environments. indeed, after its molecular characterization  <cit>  human-associated clonal complex data appear to indicate it possesses a specialized opportunistic behaviour  <cit> . it is frequently isolated from contaminated medical materials/devices and specimens obtained from immunocompromised patients  <cit> , and after the first recognized case of human disease induced by this organism  <cit> , o. anthropi infections causing primary or catheter-associated bacteraemia  <cit>  have been increasingly reported  <cit> . with this in mind, when this infection did occur in our hospital, we set out to study the identification and typing of the o. anthropi strains through the genomic and proteomic correlation. to our knowledge, this represents the first study on strain typing of o. anthropi where the use of both rep-pcr and maldi-tof-ms-based fingerprinting were carried out. all patients developed infection during their stay in hospital, and in our institution no cases of infection due to o. anthropi had been diagnosed before. environmental and flushing solution cultures were negative for o. anthropi, therefore the source of the infection strains remained unclear. fluoroquinolone monotherapy yielded good clinical response, however blood cultures from all patients became negative only after removal of cvc.

our results indicate that all investigated strains were highly related and that they arose from a common ancestor, strongly providing evidence for a clonal origin of the infection. interestingly, the strains detected early on during the outbreak showed a great variability in correlation range , while bacteria isolated later showed a correlation higher than 99%. we can therefore speculate that o. anthropi is able to undergo rapid modifications, allowing bacteria to adapt to a human host. the proteomic profiles, which clustered the  <dig> strains in a single group, unrelated to the atcc isolates present in the database , further suggest a clonal origin of the infections. moreover strains studied showed phylogenetically different patterns from atcc reference strains used in all methods employed and different cluster patterns under rep-pcr fingerprinting and maldi-tof. a likely explanation for these differences could be that rep-pcr analysis embraces the entire bacterial chromosome, whereas the main signals reported in maldi-tof ms are generated from ribosomal proteins alone  <cit> . since we studied a small number of strains, we can’t draw firm conclusions about the correlation between automated rep-pcr and maldi-tof for molecular typing of ochrobactrum anthropi. however, both methods have demonstrated a similar sensitivity in discriminating the variability among the strains studied. although strict comparison between pfge and maldi-tof was problematic, due to the different methods involved , the tests showed a similar separation between the cz <dig> strain and the other strains. although the results obtained by the two techniques were similar, on the whole, maldi-tof results were obtained much more rapidly, within a few minutes. maldi-tof is not only much easier and less-time consuming than pfge, it also requires a limited amount of bacterial colonies and allows comparison at all times with the universal database.

semi-automated rep-pcr appeared to be more discriminative than pfge in typing the  <dig> o. anthropi strains isolated during this hospital outbreak. both rep-pcr and maldi-tof ms yielded four clusters and a common ancestor, while pfge showed the same pfge profile in  <dig> isolates. in pfge, strain cz <dig> was the odd one out, whereas rep-pcr identified strain cz <dig> as being different. these strains were found to be genetically unrelated to each other.

the marker used for the rep-pcr analysis  is less genetically stable than the one used for pfge . hence, the variability shown by rep-pcr is likely to represent changes in the same clone that could not be detected by pfge  <cit> . rep-pcr analysis is a technique aimed at defining clonal relationships, and its ease of use and faster turnaround time as compared to pfge makes it a rapid method of screening outbreaks of o. anthropi and therefore allows timely implementation of control measures.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, rep-pcr and maldi-tof ms appear to be extremely useful for evaluation of clonal relationships between isolates. the different marker  evaluated, as well as the completely different techniques used increase the reliability with which isolate similarity or diversity may be assessed during a hospital outbreak. in addition, we believe that advances in the molecular typing of ochrobactrum anthropi would facilitate the study on the epidemiology, prevention and control of the infections caused by this pathogen.
