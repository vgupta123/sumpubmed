BACKGROUND
lactic acid bacteria is now widely used as probiont for its multifactorial benefits to humans as well as to organisms like fish, poultry and other live stock. in addition to various sources of isolation  <cit> , several recent studies have described the isolation and characterisation of probiotic microorganisms from traditionally fermented sources like dongchimi, kimchi, meju, and doenjang  <cit> , and kallappam batter, koozh and mor kuzhambu  <cit> . likewise, traditional ayurvedic medicines might serve as a source and a reservoir of potential probiotic microbes. nevertheless, there are very little efforts made in exploration of probionts from ayurvedic fermented sources. to the best of our knowledge, kanjika is the only ayurvedic source explored in detail for the isolation and in vitro characterisation of lactobacillus spp. for probiotic attributes  <cit> . in this study, kutajarista is used as a source for the isolation of potential probiotic isolates. kutajarista is a well known polyherbal ayurvedic formulation prepared traditionally by fermentation of the decoction of holarrhena antidysentrica as the main constituent  <cit> . it is being prescribed for a number of chronic diseases like amoebic dysentery, piles, intestinal parasites infestation and other disorders like fever, indigestion, and malabsorption syndrome  <cit> .

there are growing number of studies that show the ability of lactobacillus spp. to antagonize various pathogens, like enterohemorrhagic e. coli  <cit> , helicobacter pylori  <cit> , salmonella typhimurium  <cit> , shigella dysenteriae  <cit> , using in vitro and in vivo systems. probiotic microorganisms like lactobacillus spp. exert beneficial effects on epithelial cells by secreting bioactive and extracellular proteins. moreover, the active fraction has been isolated and tested for its activity as immunomodulators and inhibitors for pathogenic microorganisms  <cit> . some recent reports also suggest the restoration of barrier function in epithelial cells by probiotic treatment due to the strengthening of tight junctions  <cit> . gene expression profiling of tight junction proteins demonstrated the effect of l. plantarum mb <dig> in strengthening of tight junction associated proteins in caco <dig> cell line  <cit> . additionally, immunolocalization studies on tight junction proteins like zo- <dig>  claudin and f-actin demonstrate preventive role of l. sobrius in enterotoxigenic effect of e. coli k <dig>  <cit> .

among the species of aeromonas, a. hydrophila, a. salmonicida and a. veronii are considered as emerging human pathogens and have a potent role in various gastrointestinal disorders. several clinical studies highlight the outbreak of aeromonas spp. infection in diarrhoea  <cit> . aeromonas spp. harbours at various ecological niche, making the transmission of this pathogen more susceptible to humans  <cit> . a. veronii , bacterial strain that is used in this study was first reported from a mosquito midgut and subsequently reported from drinking water supplies and other sources  <cit> , possess multiple virulence attributes like haemolytic activity, plasmids, quorum sensing and type four secretion system. these virulent properties can be implicated in its role for toxin production and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes across and within the genera  <cit> . in addition to previously established virulence traits, a. veronii was found to be coding for aerolysin and type three secretion systems.

in the current study, we isolated and characterised potential probiotic microorganisms from an ayurvedic formulation, kutajarista. we identified one of our twelve isolates, vr <dig>  homologous to l. plantarum as a promising candidate exhibiting tolerance to low ph, bile salts and simulated gastric juice conditions. accompanying studies demonstrated that vr <dig> is adherent to human derived ht- <dig> cells and antagonises the growth of commonly known pathogens like s. aureus, p. aeruginosa and particularly a. veronii. we further demonstrated that vacuole formation, epithelial damage and cytotoxicity caused by a. veronii was reduced or ameliorated by vr <dig> 

RESULTS
vr <dig> isolated from kutajarista exhibited strong probiotic attributes
twelve isolates obtained after enrichment of kutajarista in mrs broth were identified on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequencing. one of the isolates showed maximum homology with l. plantarum based on 16s rrna gene sequence . its phylogenetic affiliation was deduced by comparing the homologous 16s rrna gene sequences from ncbi and the phylogenetic tree is shown in additional file  <dig>  fig s <dig> 

acid, bile and gastric juice tolerance is considered to be the preliminary characteristics of any strain to claim its probiotic potential  <cit> . vr <dig> showed tolerance to low ph , bile salt concentration of  <dig> % and simulated gastric juice. there was a little increase of  <dig>  log  during the course of incubation for  <dig> h, which further suggested that it can tolerate and remain viable at acidic ph  <dig>  . in  <dig> % bile, there was increase of  <dig>  log  after  <dig> h of incubation and in simulated gastric juice tolerance test, a decrease of  <dig>  log  on growth was observed. l. plantarum is known to be adherent to intestinal cell lines like caco <dig> and ht- <dig>  this study showed that vr <dig> was adherent to ht- <dig> cell line with the adhesion ratio of  <dig>  Â±  <dig> %, which was in concordance with the earlier studies  <cit> .

cfs of vr <dig> antagonised the growth of enteric pathogens
antagonistic activity of vr <dig> culture supernatant was examined using well-diffusion test against s. aureus , s. lutea , a. veronii , e. coli , p. aeruginosa , s. epidermidis , and clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa , and e. coli . vr <dig> showed antimicrobial activity against all the tested microorganisms, with strong antibacterial activity against a. veronii with  <dig> mm inhibitory zone .

1diameter of the well  <dig> mm. 2values shown represent the mean of three replicates

vacuole formation by a. veronii on vero cells were moderated by vr <dig> cfs
sensitivity of vero cells for aeromonas cytotoxicity has been well documented  <cit> . vero cells were treated with cfs of a. veronii and vr <dig>  in 1: <dig> ratio in dmem. figure  <dig> revealed the formation of perinuclear vacuoles in more than 50% of cells and cell detachment was observed after five hours of incubation with a. veronii cfs; however, pre-incubation with vr <dig> supernatant for  <dig> h reduced the vacuole formation and cell detachment.

time lapse microscopy revealed delayed cytotoxic effects of a. veronii on vero cells pre-incubated with vr1
time lapse microscopic images were taken at various time intervals for  <dig> h . treatment with a. veronii supernatant in 1: <dig> ratio to media started showing acute cytopathic effect with cell detachment from the surface, after  <dig> h of incubation. alteration in vero cells was followed by a change from normal spindle shaped to round swollen morphology with an extensively altered cytoplasm and gradual destruction of the monolayer. however, these cytopathic effects were delayed by  <dig> h, where a. veronii supernatant was co-incubated with vr <dig> supernatant. vero cells pre-treated for  <dig> h with vr <dig> supernatant showed marked reduction in the cytotoxicity caused by a. veronii, and only few cells were detached even after  <dig> h of incubation.

vr <dig> prevented disruption of zo- <dig> and f-actin caused by a. veronii
immunofluorescence for tight junction protein zo- <dig>  revealed continuous and circumferential zo- <dig> distribution in mdck cells treated with vr <dig> cfs  similar to control cells . however, fragmented, diffused and punctated pattern of zo- <dig> distribution was observed in case of cells treated with a. veronii supernatant . pre-incubation of mdck cells with vr <dig> for  <dig> h prior to a. veronii infection prevented these changes and showed clear delineation of cellular borders in a belt like manner . treatment with a. veronii supernatant led to disorganisation of actin filaments and nuclear condensation was also observed . however, pre-incubation of cells with vr <dig> supernatant maintained the cellular morphology comparable to control cells. in both the treatments i.e. vr <dig> cfs, and a. veronii cfs treatment on cells that were pre-incubated with cfs of vr <dig>  actin filaments were present in high density at the apical perijunctional regions, encircling the cells in a belt like manner . however, co-incubation of a. veronii and vr <dig> supernatant  led to the loss of membrane architecture with loss of fluorescence of zo- <dig> and actin, as observed in a. veronii treatment group.

cfs of vr <dig> significantly lowered cytotoxicity induced by a. veronii
the cytotoxic effect of a. veronii cfs was confirmed by mtt assay, which essentially checks cell viability . cell viability was reduced to 60% in vero cells treated with a. veronii supernatant for  <dig> h. interestingly, vero cells when pre-incubated with vr <dig> cfs for  <dig> h followed by  <dig> h of treatment with a. veronii cfs showed no loss of cell viability. similarly, vr <dig> cfs treatment did not show any detrimental effects on cells with no loss in cell viability. however, co-incubation of vr <dig> and a. veronii supernatant was not effective in preventing cytotoxicity caused by a. veronii.

discussion
kutajarista is an ayurvedic formulation prescribed for the treatment of dysentery, piles etc. initial characterisation of bacterial diversity of kutajarista by the 16s rrna gene clone library  provided evidence about the richness of lactobacillus spp. in the preparation of ayurvedic medicine. therefore, the current study was aimed at characterization of probiotic and antibacterial properties of l. plantarum vr <dig> isolated from kutajarista, against a known cytotoxic and virulent strain, a. veronii. previously, it has been reported that l. delbrueckii, l. lactis and l. mesenteroides can prevent cellular damage caused by a. salmonicida, a fish pathogen  <cit> . here we report that vr <dig> possess strong probiotic properties and abrogated the cytotoxicity of a. veronii mtcc  <dig>  an isolate from mosquito midgut. to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the preventive role of cfs from vr <dig> in cellular and epithelial damage caused by a. veronii.

traditionally fermented products are rich source of lactobacilli, which can be exploited for their probiotic potential. indian fermented foods like kallappam, koozh and mor kuzhambu were reported as a source of potential probiotic lactobacillus spp. and which is useful as biopreservative  <cit> . ayurveda is traditionally practised medicinal science for many centuries and medicines are prepared from herbs. however, very little efforts have been made in utilizing these preparations as a source of probionts. there is only major study which reported the isolation and charactarisation of seventeen lactobacillus spp. from kanjika, an ayurvedic formulation, for probiotic attributes  <cit> . in the present study, we used kutajarista, an ayurvedic herbal decoction, for isolation of potential probiont. vr <dig> showed highest homology to l. plantarum and exhibited probiotic characteristics such as tolerance to acidic ph, bile salts and simulated gastric juice. vr <dig> also showed adherence to intestinal cell line ht- <dig>  which is one of the essential prerequisites for a probiotic microorganism. all these features indicate this strain of l. plantarum as a potential probiont. a recent report by anderson et al.  <cit>  suggests that l. plantarum has better probiotic characteristics and it also reduces enteropathogenic effect of e. coli as compared to commercial strains like l. rhamnosus. moreover, l. plantarum has been reported to inhibit pathogens in in vitro and in vivo systems  <cit> . on the same lines, l. plantarum isolated from kutajarista showed inhibition of the tested type strains and clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa and e. coli. interestingly vr <dig> also prevented the growth of a. veronii, for which virulent attributes have already been established  <cit> .

the pathogenicity of genus aeromonas is multifactorial and is attributed to factors such as; cytotoxin, aerolysin, hemolysin, adhesins and secretory systems. apart from other virulence factors which may contribute to the pathogenesis of a. veronii, here we report the presence of type three secretion system and aerolysin , putatively involved in secretion of virulence factors to the host cell and haemolytic activity respectively. our previous studies have also demonstrated that a. veronii mtcc  <dig> is multi-drug resistant, and harbours three uncharacterised plasmids and one of the plasmids codes for functional type four secretion system  <cit> .

after establishing the fact that a. veronii was cytotoxic to mammalian cells and harbours many virulence factors, our next goal was to observe the protective or preventive role of vr <dig> in a. veronii infection. we used cfs of vr <dig> to examine its efficacy in amelioration of cytotoxicity caused by a. veronii supernatant. we observed high level of vacuole formation as an indication of cytotoxicity and morphological changes in vero cells. earlier, in an enterohaemorrhagic e. coli infection model, it was shown that pre-incubation with l. plantarum abolished the cytotoxicity caused by enteropathogenic strain  <cit> . to test whether vr <dig> had similar effects, we studied the time dependent effects of cfs of a. veronii, vr <dig>  in combination or treatment of a. veronii on vr <dig> pre-incubated cells. we found that pre-incubation of vero cells with vr <dig> cfs delayed cytotoxicity, which was induced by a. veronii. vacuolating cytotoxic factor from a. veronii was earlier reported to cause cell death  <cit> .

tight junction disruption is considered to be one of the indicators of morphological damage caused due to cytotoxicity. mdck cell line infected with v. cholerae cytotoxin and s. typhimurium showed a clear indication of epithelial barrier dysfunction by disruption of tight junction  <cit> . in fish, pre-incubation with prospective probiont l. delbrueckii sub sp. lactis could prevent epithelial damage caused by a. salmonicida  <cit> . to investigate the effect of cfs derived from vr <dig>  and a. veronii on epithelial barrier, we selected mdck cell line over caco <dig> cell line because it exhibits similar epithelial characteristics like formation of uniform columnar epithelia, tight junction, and it has an advantage of a short culture period of 5- <dig> days in comparison to caco <dig> which has  <dig> days of growth period  <cit> . we found that a. veronii indeed caused epithelial damage by disruption of zo- <dig> and f-actin in mdck cell line, which was prevented by pre-incubation with vr <dig> supernatant for  <dig> h, whereas co-incubation was not able to restore the epithelial integrity. zo- <dig> is a cytoplasmic protein which interacts directly with f-actin and is very important in structural and functional organisation of tight junction. in this study, microscopic observation of cellular damage is well supported by immunolocalization of zo- <dig> and f-actin, which give clear evidence of vr <dig> in ameliorating the epithelial damage caused by a. veronii. this finding is consistent with earlier report that, l. rhamnosus gg treatment ameliorated the redistribution of zo- <dig> and claudin in mdck cell line caused by enterohemorrhagic e. coli  <cit> . in another study, incubation with cfs of b. lactis  <dig> has been shown to increase the intestinal epithelial integrity against enteropathogenic e. coli   <cit> .

cell viability assessed by mtt assay revealed that vr <dig> cfs treatment was not detrimental to cells and there was no loss in viability when pre-incubated with vr <dig> cfs. on the other hand, co-incubation could not prevent the loss in cell viability caused by a. veronii. pre-incubation of caco <dig> with p <dig> and p <dig> isolated from the soluble protein of l. rhamnosus gg, abrogated the disruptive effect of h2o <dig> on tight junctions of caco <dig> cells  <cit> . the protective effect of soluble proteins was shown to be by activation of map kinase and pkc dependent signalling pathways. one more study  documented that pre-incubation of l. casei with t <dig> cells could abolish the invasion and adhesion of epec. on these lines, we speculate, pre-incubation of mammalian cells with cfs of lactobacilli sp. initiates cellular signalling which either inhibits or upregulate tight junction proteins that may get damaged by entero pathogens.

in view of the increasing prevalence of aeromonas spp. in food products, this study assumes significance of its application of l. plantarum as a potential probiotic microorganism. the findings also suggest that the regular usage of probiotic microorganisms in food preparations can prevent the cytotoxicity or manifestation of pathogenicity in future encounter with pathogens. further in depth studies will be necessary to understand the preventive role of vr <dig> in invivo model for a. veronii infection and to identify its active component which may be used as potential preventive cure against gastro-intestinal infection.

CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of isolation of potential probiotic isolate, l. plantarum vr <dig> from kutajarista, an ayurvedic fermented medicine. cfs of vr <dig> possesses strong antibacterial property against a. veronii and reduces its cytotoxic effects in mdck and vero cell lines. hence, l. plantarum can be an effective probiotic to prevent aeromonas infection as well, as it has been proposed for some other enteric pathogens.
