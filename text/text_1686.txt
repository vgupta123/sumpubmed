BACKGROUND
despite its key role in alzheimer's disease  pathogenesis, the physiological functions of the β-amyloid precursor protein  and its close homologue, the β-amyloid precursor-like protein  <dig> , are still poorly understood. this is due to two major problems complicating the in vivo analysis. i) app is subject to complex proteolytical processing and ii) app is part of a gene family with partially overlapping functions.

app is a type i transmembrane protein, and processing  is initiated either by α-secretase cleavage within the aβ region, or by β-secretase  cleavage at the n-terminus of aβ, leading to the secretion of large soluble ectodomains, termed appsα and appsβ respectively. subsequent γ-secretase processing of the c-terminal fragments  results in the production of secreted aβ, p <dig> and the app intracellular domain . both aplps are similarly processed by the same secretases. it is evident that app/aplps are highly complex molecules, that may exert important functions as unprocessed cell surface molecules  as well as functions mediated by their diverse proteolytic fragments. app processing is highly reminiscent to that of notch with γ-secretase-mediated release of the notch intracellular domain  triggering the translocation of nicd to the nucleus. this results in transcriptional regulation of defined target genes involved in e.g. neuronal differentiation. thus, a similar functional role for aicd  as transcriptional regulator has been proposed  <cit> . indeed, aicd has been shown to translocate to the nucleus and can form a complex with the adaptor fe <dig> and the histone acetyltransferase tip <dig>  this complex can induce the transcription of artificial reporter constructs in transfected cells  <cit> . likewise, aplp <dig> and aplp <dig> are subject to γ-secretase processing and can stimulate the expression of heterologous reporter constructs in an fe65-dependent manner  <cit> . additional complexity comes from recent studies indicating that app  can form tripartite complexes with the adaptor protein mint <dig> and the transcriptional co-activators taz and yap. when overexpressed in hek <dig> cells, this complex functions in gal <dig> reporter assays  <cit> . to date, several putative aicd target genes have been identified  including kai <dig>  <cit> , gsk3b  <cit> , nep  <cit> , egfr  <cit> , p <dig>  <cit> , lrp  <cit> , tip <dig>  bace <dig>  app itself  <cit>  as well as genes involved in cytoskeletal dynamics  <cit> . however, the validity of these proposed targets, in particular regarding the question of whether they also constitute endogenous aicd/alid target genes, has remained controversial  <cit> . interestingly, in several recent studies, increased production of aicd either in transfected cells or in transgenic animals did not lead to a consistent up-regulation of previously proposed target genes  <cit> .

previously, we showed that knockout  mice deficient in a single family member such as app  are viable  <cit>  whereas combined app-/-aplp2-/- or aplp1-/-aplp2-/- double ko mice  <cit>  and app-/-aplp1-/-aplp2-/- triple mutants  <cit>  die shortly after birth, likely due to defects of neuromuscular transmission  <cit> . neither app-/- nor aplp2-/- mice display obvious defects of central nervous system  morphology, yet app-/- mice revealed reduced body weight and defects in spatial learning associated with impaired synaptic plasticity including long-term potentiation   <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these defects have remained unclear.

processing of app gives rise to several fragments including besides neurotoxic aβ the α-secretase-generated soluble appsα fragment that is neuroprotective and involved in synaptic plasticity  <cit> . to delineate its specific functions, we previously generated appsα knockin  mice by inserting via gene targeting a stop codon into the endogenous app locus right after the α-secretase cleavage site  <cit> . thus, appα/α knockin mice express only secreted appsα from the endogenous app promoter .

here, we employed a rational unbiased approach and investigated transcriptional changes arising due to the lack of app family members in the adult cortex of knockout mice to gain further insight into the physiological and signaling functions of app family members. this includes transcriptome changes that may arise due to a lack of direct aicd/alid-mediated transcriptional regulation as well as changes resulting from indirect signaling events mediated by transmembrane app/aplp isoforms. first, we analyzed transcriptome changes due to the complete absence of app or aplp <dig>  by conducting the pairwise comparisons of wt versus app-/-  and wt versus aplp2-/- . second, we had a closer look at the role of different app fragments, in particular appsα. therefore, we compared the transcriptome of appα/α mice both to wt  and app-/- mice , respectively. third, we addressed the influence of the genetic background by comparing knockout animals of mixed  <dig> × c57bl/ <dig> genetic background -/-) to those backcrossed to c57bl/ <dig> for  <dig> generations.

RESULTS
we subjected prefrontal cortices of adult male mice  of the following groups to transcriptome analysis: wt , app-/- , appα/α , aplp2-/- , aplp2-/-  . wt, app-/-, appα/α, aplp2-/- had been backcrossed for six generations to c57bl/ <dig> mice. aplp2-/- mice harbor the identical knockout allele as aplp2-/- but were only backcrossed once. note that app-/- mice lack membrane-anchored full length app  as well as all proteolytic fragments derived from it , whereas appα/α mice express appsα but lack full length app and all other fragments.

raw data was processed according to the rma procedure  <cit> . we validated the microarray data by clustering the processed raw data based on all available app/aplp <dig> probe sets. as expected, all samples grouped according to their genotypes: wt, app-/-, appα/α, and aplp2-/- samples were clearly separated .

differential gene expression in mice lacking app family members
first, we wanted to address the question of which impact each genotype has on transcription by searching for genes that show differential expression in the different comparisons. to identify significantly up- or down-regulated genes, we performed a significance analysis of microarrays  with a false discovery rate  of app. 5% .

the number of significant genes is displayed for all relevant comparisons if at least one probe set identifier of the gene meets the respective criteria. note that probe sets for app and aplp <dig> are not part of the indicated numbers. numbers indicate significant genes either with fold change criterion  or without fold change criterion . note that all animals had been backcrossed for  <dig> generations to c57bl/ <dig> .

a total of  <dig> genes  were differentially expressed in wt/app-/-. the comparison wt/aplp2-/- led to  <dig> differentially expressed genes . for the comparison wt/appα/α, we observed  <dig> significantly regulated genes . in contrast, we only observed  <dig> significant genes in the comparison appα/α/app-/- . based on the total number of significant differentially expressed genes in these comparisons, the aplp <dig> knockout has the highest impact on gene expression.

to get an idea how many differentially expressed genes with high fold changes are within each list, we introduced a fold change criterion and determined the number of genes that differ by at least 2-fold . in the comparisons wt/app-/-  <dig> genes, in wt/aplp2-/-  <dig> genes, in wt/appα/α  <dig> genes, and in appα/α/app-/-  <dig> genes passed this criterion. this shows that the majority of significant differentially expressed genes show only small to moderate  alterations in gene expression. this is consistent with previous studies  <cit>  and likely due to the complex nature of cortical tissue consisting of a multitude of neuronal and glial subpopulations. in app-/- and appα/α animals, no compensatory up-regulation of aplp <dig> and aplp <dig> at the mrna level was observed. likewise, no up-regulation of app and aplp <dig> was observed in aplp2-/- animals thus confirming previous western blot results  <cit> .

analysis of biological pathways affected in app/aplp knockout mice
subsequently, we analyzed the list of significant genes from all comparisons using david bioinformatics resources  <cit> . within david, we did functional annotation clustering using gene ontology terms  and pathway databases  to gain an overview about the nature of genes and potential shared functional pathways.

we found  <dig> enriched clusters in the comparison wt/app-/-,  <dig> in wt/appα/α, and  <dig> in wt/aplp2-/- . due to the low number of significant genes in appα/α/app-/-, no gene set enrichment could be assessed. interestingly, several of these enriched clusters were shared between the different pairwise comparisons including regulation of neurogenesis, transcription and kinase activity .

the finding that lack of either app or aplp <dig> affects expression of genes involved in neurogenesis confirms and further extends previous studies that implicated app in neuronal progenitor regulation  <cit> . in app-overexpressing transgenic mouse models, adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus is impaired  <cit>  which has been mainly attributed to aβ-mediated toxic effects. regulation of transcription was identified as another shared cluster between wt/app-/- and wt/aplp2-/- pointing towards similar functions of app family members in this cellular process, possibly via aicd/alid signaling or via more indirect mechanisms. shared functional clusters were also found for wt/app-/- and wt/appα/α, namely neurogenesis and negative regulation of protein kinase activity which may indicate that phenotypes of app-ko mice, e.g. defects in synaptic plasticity, arise due to alterations in the phosphorylation state of yet to be identified target proteins.

although aβ serves as a central trigger for ad pathogenesis, the physiological role of app and the question of whether a loss of its functions contributes to ad are still unclear. we therefore investigated a possible enrichment of genes previously linked to alzheimer's disease in our dataset. comparing the  <dig> genes differentially expressed in wt/app-/- with the alzgene dataset , we identified  <dig> genes, namely abcg <dig>  ache, aldh <dig>  arsb, bcl <dig>  bdnf, crh, egr <dig>  fos, gstz <dig>  hspa1a, hspa1b, hspa <dig>  ppp1r3c. next, we assessed whether this number of  <dig> identified genes represents a significant enrichment of ad-related genes in the wt/app-/- dataset. to this end, we randomly drew  <dig> gene sets of the same size  from the pool of genes covered by the array and checked them against the alzgene set. we found an average of  <dig> genes per randomly drawn gene set and used this as reference for fisher's exact test. however, no significant enrichment of genes from the alzgene dataset was present in wt/app-/-.

proposed aicd target genes show only a minor or no significant differential expression in app- and aplp2-deficient cortex
several genes have been proposed to be directly regulated at the transcriptional/promoter level by an aicd/fe <dig> transcriptionally active complex including bace <dig>  <cit> , kai <dig>  <cit> , egfr  <cit> , gsk3b  <cit> , p <dig>  <cit> , tip <dig>  <cit> , and vglut <dig>  <cit> . by array analysis we detected in aplp2-/- mice for vglut <dig> and gsk3b a small yet significant up-regulation of  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively, compared to wild-type animals . in all other genotypes, including app-/-, expression was, however, not significantly altered. to further validate these results we conducted a qpcr analysis of these proposed target genes . this way, we detected a  <dig> -fold increase of egfr mrna expression solely in aplp2-/- animals, compared to wild type controls . of note, qpcr analysis of app-/-, appα/α and aplp2-/- cortex failed to detect significant expression differences of all other tested candidate genes, including vglut <dig> and gsk3b.

what might be the reasons that proposed target genes have proven difficult to confirm in follow-up studies including work reported here? a major reason may be the difference in experimental systems used as overexpression in cell lines may not necessarily reflect a role of aicd for endogenous gene expression. in line with this study, we previously found no impact on kai <dig>  gsk3a, gsk3b, app, and nep mrna expression when treating different cell lines with the γ-secretase inhibitor dapt or when assessing endogenous gene expression in aicd-deficient model systems  <cit> . in addition, as shown by the same study, clonal variability of immortalized fibroblast lines may lead to variable gene expression irrespective of either app-/- or app+/+ genotype  <cit> . on the other hand, one might expect an inverse regulation of target genes upon aicd deficiency as opposed to overexpression. a genome-wide microarray-based approach to detect aicd target genes used an inducible fe65/aicd cell line  <cit> . here, no change in kai <dig> and gsk3b mrna expression was detected. similarly, waldron et al.  <cit>  found no alteration in mrna expression of kai <dig>  bace <dig>  egfr, tip <dig>  and p <dig> in aicd-enriched fe65-tranfected cells. moreover, transcriptome analysis in aicd transgenic mouse brain revealed no apparent difference between transgenic animals and littermate controls  <cit>  and qpcr analysis of proposed target genes, including those studied here, failed to detect significant changes in mrna expression. overall, our results are highly consistent with these studies. although our study clearly indicates that aicd or alid <dig> are on their own not essential transcriptional regulators of tested target genes in adult prefrontal cortex, we cannot exclude at present that other app family members  may at least partially compensate for a single gene deficiency. due to the lethality of combined mutants shortly after birth we had previously analyzed the expression of a subset of target genes in app-/-aplp2-/- embryonic brain and fibroblasts  <cit> . as aplp <dig> is not expressed in fibroblasts, app-/-aplp2-/- fibroblasts  provide a cellular model in which all app family members are lacking. however, neither nep nor gsk3b expression was significantly affected in either embryonic brain or fibroblasts  <cit> . a global assessment of transcriptome changes in adult brain lacking multiple app family members  will await the generation of viable conditional mutants. considering the complexity of cortical tissue, it is still possible that gene expression differences occurring only in distinct cell types may remain below the detection limit of our analysis. in line with this hypothesis, schrenk-siemens et al  <cit>  reported a reduction of vglut <dig> mrna and vglut <dig> protein expression in glutamatergic neurons obtained by retinoic acid differentiation of app-/-aplp2-/- embryonic stem cells whereas in this study no difference was detectable in cortical tissue. it remains to be seen whether regulation of other target genes might also be cell type-specific.

genes co-regulated due to the lack of either app or aplp2
as there is genetic  <cit>  and cell biological evidence  that app family members serve related physiological functions, we searched for genes that are, compared to wild-type, differentially regulated in more than one genotype . to this end, we created a venn diagram of the pairwise comparisons wt/app-/- and wt/aplp2-/-. we found  <dig> probe set identifiers  representing  <dig> known genes that are differentially expressed in both cases  and regulated in the same direction as shown by cluster analysis . furthermore, we analyzed how many of these genes were in addition significantly regulated in wt/appα/α. out of  <dig> genes co-regulated by lack of either app or aplp <dig>   <dig> were also found in the comparison wt/appα/α and regulated in the same direction . thus, functional similarities of app family members are also reflected at the transcriptional level by co-regulated gene sets in the respective loss-of-function mutants. to investigate this more closely we further examined two of these genes by qpcr analysis: heat shock protein  <dig>  and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a .

hspa <dig> attracted our attention for two reasons. amongst co-regulated genes we found a consistent down-regulation of four heat-shock proteins including besides hspa <dig>  hspa1b, hspb <dig>  and hsph <dig>  hspa <dig>  is an er chaperone involved in the er stress response and had previously been shown to interact with app and modulate aβ production  <cit> . in addition, grp <dig> was recently identified as a gene that may counteract the proliferative effect of secreted apps in tumor models  <cit> . as functional annotation clustering identified neurogenesis as a pathway affected in all genotypes compared to wild-type, it was interesting to find cdkn1a, also known as p <dig>  amongst these co-regulated genes. based on array analysis, both cdkn1a and hspa <dig> were down-regulated by about two-fold in all three mutant genotypes compared to wt . employing qpcr we confirmed these results and found again a significant down-regulation of about the same magnitude .

it is noteworthy that in app-overexpressing transgenic mice hspa <dig> had previously been found to be up-regulated  <cit>  suggesting an inverse transcriptional regulation as a consequence of either loss or gain of app-dependent signaling. the cdk inhibitor p <dig> has been shown to restrict adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, as evidenced by increased proliferation of neuronal progenitors in p21-/- mice  <cit> . given the cdkn1a/p <dig> down-regulation we found here, one might thus expect app-/-  mice to show dysregulated neurogenesis. on the other hand, we had previously shown that endogenous apps and aplp2s play a crucial role as growth factors for neuronal stem cells in the adult subventricular zone   <cit> . depletion of appsα by infusion of app-binding antibodies or as a consequence of pharmacological inhibition of appsα production reduced the number of neuronal progenitor cells in the svz  <cit> . thus neurogenesis might be under complex control of app-mediated signaling pathways, both by membrane-anchored app and secreted app isoforms.

role of app domains for transcriptome changes
next, we compared the transcriptome of app-/- mice to that of appα/α animals . specifically, we wanted to answer the question of whether the transcriptome of appα/α mice would be more similar to that of wt mice , or would rather resemble that of app-/- cortices . as appsα is sufficient to rescue the learning impairment and ltp defect of app-/- mice  <cit> , we initially inferred that this would also apply for the transcriptome of appα/α mice. however, in the significance analysis, appα/α/app-/- was the comparison with the lowest number of significant genes whereas the number of significant differentially expressed genes for wt/app-/- and wt/appα/α was at least  <dig> times higher  indicating a close resemblance of appα/α and app-/- samples. next, we generated a venn diagram to gain an overview on the absolute number of significant genes found in each intersection . a high proportion of genes significant in wt/appα/α was also significant in wt/app-/- leading to a subset of  <dig> co-regulated genes. second, to get a more quantitative understanding on this part of the dataset, we calculated the percentage of probe sets that were co-regulated between the different pairwise comparisons. to this end, we ranked all probe sets according to their absolute significance score and used the most significant  <dig> probe sets of each of these pairwise comparisons to generate the venn diagram . wt/app-/- and wt/appα/α have 40% of the  <dig> probe sets in common whereas wt/app-/- and appα/α/app-/- share only  <dig> out of  <dig> probe sets . taken together these results suggest that with regard to transcriptional changes appα/α is functionally very similar to a complete app knockout. these data may indicate an important role of full length app and/or app c-terminal fragments for direct or indirect signaling resulting in transcriptome changes.

in addition, we raised the question whether the constitutive expression of appsα would lead to changes in gene expression, as recently reported for appsβ  <cit> . we found a small percentage  of probe sets in the intersection of appα/α/app-/- and wt/appα/α . to investigate this finding further, we analyzed the  <dig> significant genes that are found within this group  and used their corresponding  <dig> probe sets for a cluster analysis . hierarchical clustering results in a clear separation of appα/α from wt and app-/- cortices. this points to a small subpopulation of genes that are actually regulated by the constant production of appsα in the absence of app full length and all other fragments.

next, we took a closer look at genes co-regulated by the complete absence of app or app-fl as identified in the intersection of wt/app-/- and wt/appα/α . interestingly, this gene set comprises several synaptic plasticity-related genes including the immediate early response factors arc , fos , egr <dig> , and dio <dig> , a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the nuclear hormone triiodothyronine . validation of these genes by qpcr  consistently identified an about  <dig> - to 2-fold down-regulation in all genotypes and thus confirmed gene expression changes identified by array analysis. in case of dio <dig>  down-regulation in aplp2-/- now reached significance level when using qpcr analysis as compared to array values.

arc mrna accumulates in activated synapses, modulates ampar trafficking and is critically involved in memory consolidation and ltp  <cit> . both fos, best known for its binding to the jun/ap- <dig> transcription factor complex, and the zn2+-finger transcription factor egr2/krox- <dig> are induced during neuronal activity  <cit>  and play an important role in learning and memory as well as ltp  <cit> . as app-/- mice show an age-dependent deficit in spatial learning associated with impaired long-term potentiation , it was intriguing that we found a down-regulation of genes previously implicated in synaptic plasticity although further studies are needed to establish a causal link.

influence of genetic background on gene transcription
genetic background is known to profoundly influence the occurrence, penetrance and severity of transgenic and knockout phenotypes, e.g. with regard to behavior or aβ deposition  <cit> . for one of our mutants, aplp2-/-, we had kept animals that had been backcrossed only once to c57bl/ <dig> -/-), whereas all other mutants had been backcrossed for six generations . this allowed us to investigate the impact of genetic background on transcriptome changes versus changes that arise as a consequence of aplp <dig> gene deficiency . to make this more clear for the reader, we will for the remaining study use the designation r <dig> and r <dig> for all subsequent comparisons .

the comparison aplp2-/-/aplp2-/-, i.e. between animals of the same genotype but with different genetic background, led to  <dig> significant differentially expressed genes of which  <dig> were up- and  <dig> were down-regulated . for the comparison wt/aplp2-/-  we found a total of  <dig> genes,  <dig> up-,  <dig> down-regulated . the sizes of these two sets are more than 5-fold smaller than the  <dig> genes found for wt/aplp2-/- . however, genetic background-related probe sets differentially regulated between aplp2-/- versus aplp2-/- have very high significance scores due to high gene expression changes . this considerable influence of genetic background is best reflected in the corresponding volcano plot  yielding, when compared to wt/aplp2-/- , a much larger number of probe sets with both high significance score  and high fold change in the comparison aplp2-/-/aplp2-/- . of note, only three probe sets matching these criteria were found for the comparison wt/aplp2-/- . similarly, this also holds true for any of the other pairwise comparisons for which genetic background was kept constant .

the number of significant genes is displayed for all relevant comparisons if at least one probe set identifier of the gene meets the respective criteria. note that probe sets for app and aplp <dig> are not part of the indicated numbers. numbers indicate significant genes either with fold change criterion  or without fold change criterion . r6: backcrossed to c57bl/ <dig> for  <dig> generations. r1: backcrossed to c57bl/ <dig> for  <dig> generation. note that the comparison wt/aplp2-/- is identical to wt/aplp2-/-.

to study the impact of genetic background more closely, we calculated the percentages of overlap from the most significant  <dig> probe sets for each of the three comparisons . if transcriptome changes arise primarily as a consequence of aplp <dig> deficiency independent of genetic background, we would expect a high number of co-regulated probe sets in the comparisons wt/aplp2-/- and wt/aplp2-/-. the percentage of probe sets found in this intersection is, however, surprisingly small . contrary to our expectation, the highest overlap of probe sets  is found in the intersection of wt/aplp2-/- and aplp2-/-/aplp2-/- .

to gain an overview on absolute number of differentially expressed genes, we created a venn diagram from the pairwise comparisons wt/aplp2-/-, wt/aplp2-/-, and aplp2-/-/aplp2-/- . interestingly, we found a set of  <dig> significant genes in the intersection of wt/aplp2-/- and aplp2-/-/aplp2-/- . the corresponding cluster analysis shows that aplp2-/- samples cluster together with wt samples while aplp2-/- samples were clearly separated . probe sets in this intersection represent genes that are differentially expressed due to aplp <dig> deficiency but only in combination with an r <dig> background. in summary, these findings clearly indicate that genetic background may dominate transcriptome changes and needs to be carefully controlled to establish a clear link between phenotypes and altered genotype.

eventually, we were interested to identify genes that are highly differentially expressed in our knockout models compared to wild-type. ccl <dig>  ligand 21) was the gene with the highest fold change in combination with the highest significance score and exclusively up-regulated in aplp2-/- cortices on r <dig> genetic background , that is preferred in behavioral studies and to which we had therefore backcrossed our mutants. in the periphery, ccl <dig> serves as ligand for ccr <dig> that is expressed by various cells of the immune systems and is involved in lymphocytes homing . recent studies show that ccl <dig> is also expressed in the cns by endangered neurons to activate microglia via cxcr <dig>  <cit> . ccl <dig> is transported in vesicles along the axon to presynaptic structures and thereby constitutes a mediator of directed neuron-microglia signaling and remote microglia activation  <cit> . as microglia activation is associated with ad pathogenesis  <cit>  and is also frequently observed as a general indicator of brain damage, we investigated ccl <dig> expression in more detail. moreover, we sought to validate the genetic background dependence of ccl <dig> expression. using qpcr analysis, we confirmed the significant up-regulation of ccl <dig> mrna yielding a fold change in qpcr  that was even more pronounced compared to array analysis  . importantly and consistent with our array analysis, no up-regulation of ccl <dig> mrna expression was found in aplp2-/- samples. this indicates that i) other loci distinct from aplp <dig> are involved in ccl <dig> transcriptional regulation and that ii) these loci give rise to allelic variants that differ functionally between the r <dig> and r <dig> genetic background. encouraged by the high increase of ccl <dig> mrna expression, we determined ccl <dig> protein expression by elisa in cortical tissue of aplp2-/- animals and wild-type controls. ccl <dig> protein expression was significantly increased by about  <dig> -fold . as this magnitude of up-regulation was lower than expected from qpcr , we also measured mrna levels of ccl <dig> in the same brain samples used for the elisa measurement and reconfirmed the high up-regulation of about 33-fold . this difference in differential mrna  and protein  expression suggests that additional posttranslational mechanisms  limit ccl <dig> expression. in line with the moderate induction of ccl <dig> protein expression we did not detect an increase in gliosis in aplp2-deficient brains using immunohistochemistry .

CONCLUSIONS
here, we determined the effect of app-/-, appα/α and aplp2-/- genotypes on gene expression in the adult murine cortex. we found large sets of differentially expressed genes, however, fold changes were in most cases only small to moderate. previously proposed aicd target genes were not convincingly affected by lack of either app or aplp <dig>  in the complex cortical tissue of adult brain. this may either indicate that the role of aicd in transcriptional regulation has been overestimated or that gene expression changes occur only in a distinct subset of cells that is below the detection level of our analysis.

remarkably, we found the largest set of differentially expressed genes in aplp2-/- brain, although so far no apparent morphological or other phenotypic changes had been reported for aplp2-ko mice. a substantial proportion of genes were identified as co-regulated by lack of app or aplp <dig>  notably in pathways such as neuronal differentiation, neurogenesis and transcriptional regulation. this common genetic profile points towards shared physiological functions in these pathways. when comparing appsα knockin mice and app-/- mice we observed a close resemblance of the two genotypes pointing towards a crucial role of the app c-terminus for transcriptome changes. interestingly, we could demonstrate that several synaptic plasticity-related genes found in this gene set are considerably down-regulated which further substantiates the importance of app family members in this regard.

finally, we addressed the role of genetic background for transcriptome changes. here, we report that the presence of different wt-alleles can lead to profound changes in gene expression that are even higher in magnitude than those resulting from the knockout of a single gene such as aplp <dig>  thus, it is crucial to keep genetic background constant, particularly if gene expression changes are rather subtle to reliably correlate affected pathways  with a knockout phenotype. in many studies regarding aicd signaling this issue has not been addressed which may at least partially explain the conflicting results reported by different laboratories. here, we identified the chemokine ccl <dig> as a gene that is highly up-regulated in aplp2-/- cortex, but only in conjunction with c57bl/6-specific background alleles. moreover, our study corroborates that app family members are not only structurally related but also serve related physiological functions. it will therefore be of high interest to analyze phenotypic and gene expression changes in adult app/aplp <dig> double or app/aplp1/aplp <dig> triple deficient brain, once viable conditional combined mutants become available that are currently generated by crossing mice with floxed app and aplp <dig> alleles with transgenic tissue-specific cre mice  <cit> .
