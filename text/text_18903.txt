BACKGROUND
ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligate intracellular rickettsial pathogen and the causative agent of an important emerging zoonotic disease, human monocytic ehrlichiosis  <cit> . this amblyomma americanum tick-transmitted pathogen causes infections in susceptible hosts , host reservoirs , and less well described hosts such as the dog, goat and coyote  <cit> . e. chaffeensis has an unusual developmental cycle that requires growth and replication within eukaryotic cells of vertebrate and tick hosts  <cit> . during its developmental cycle, there is conversion between two distinct morphological forms, the elementary bodies  and reticulate bodies   <cit> . the ebs are the infectious form and upon entry into a host cell, they differentiate into metabolically active reticulate bodies , which are larger compared to ebs and divide by binary fission  <cit> . the reticulate bodies are also non-infectious forms  <cit> . later in the developmental cycle, rbs convert back to ebs, which are released from infected cells  <cit> . the transformation of rbs to ebs by e. chaffeensis is observed in both vertebrate and tick hosts  <cit> .

the mechanism by which the pathogen survives in dual hosts by adapting to changes in different host environments is unclear. recent studies described the differential gene and protein expression profiles of the pathogen originating from tick and mammalian cell environments  <cit> . moreover, e. chaffeensis organisms recovered from infected tick cells produce longer-lasting infections in mice compared to the infection with organisms harvested from mammalian macrophages  <cit> . differentially expressed proteins of e. chaffeensis included the predominant expression from outer membrane protein genes p28-omp <dig> and p28-omp <dig> in mammalian and tick cell environments, respectively  <cit> . the adaptive response to different host environments requires altering the gene expression, often regulated at the transcriptional level by altering rna polymerase  activity  <cit> . a typical bacterial rnap consists of five polypeptide chains; two α subunits, one each of β and β' subunits, and a σ subunit. the enzyme can take two forms, a holoenzyme containing all four different subunits or core polymerase that lacks a σ subunit  <cit> . the capacity to synthesize rna resides in the core polymerase and the role of a σ subunit is to direct initiation of transcription from specific promoters  <cit> . the genome of e. chaffeensis includes two sigma factor genes; the homologs of the major bacterial sigma factor, σ <dig>  and an alternative sigma factor, σ <dig>  <cit> . the current lack of established methods to stably transform, transfect, conjugate, or electroporate e. chaffeensis remain a major limiting factor to study mechanisms of gene expression by traditional methods. mapping the functions of e. chaffeensis genes in vivo cannot be performed because genetic manipulation systems are yet to be established. to overcome this limitation, in a recent study we reported the utility of escherichia coli rnap as a surrogate enzyme to characterize e. chaffeensis gene promoters  <cit> . although the e. coli rnap proved valuable for mapping e. chaffeensis gene promoters, the extrapolation of the data requires further validation using the e. chaffeensis rnap.

in this study, we developed a functional in vitro transcription system by utilizing g-less transcription templates  <cit>  to drive transcription from two e. chaffeensis promoters. we described the partial purification and characterization of e. chaffeensis rnap and its use in characterizing the transcriptional profiles of two p28-omp gene  promoters. in this study, we also described the recombinantly expressed e. chaffeensis sigma factor, σ <dig>  and its use in promoter analysis studies after its reconstitution with e. coli core enzyme. modulatory effect of e. chaffeensis protein lysates on in vitro transcription is also described in this study to serve as the first step towards determining the regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression in this pathogen.

RESULTS
isolation of e. chaffeensis rna polymerase 
e. chaffeensis dna-dependent rna polymerase  was partially purified from the organisms grown in macrophage cultures by adapting heparin-agarose column purification method described earlier for other bacterial systems  <cit> . to determine the purity and polypeptide composition of the e. chaffeensis rnap, several eluted fractions were electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel that was stained using silver nitrate . the gel pattern revealed that the e. chaffeensis rnap had a subunit structure similar to e. coli rnap  with five major subunits . western blot analysis confirmed the presence of e. chaffeensis σ <dig> polypeptide when assessed using a heterologous e. coli anti-σ <dig> monoclonal antibody, 2g <dig> . amino acid alignment of the sequence of e. chaffeensis σ <dig> polypeptide with e. coli σ <dig> polypeptide revealed significant homology which also spanned to the putative binding site sequence of 2g <dig> antibody to e. coli σ <dig> polypeptide  <cit>  . the homology between amino acid residues of σ <dig> polypeptides recognised by 2g <dig> antibody  <cit>  is considerably higher between e. chaffeensis and e. coli than between e. chaffeensis and chlamydia trachomatis . protein blast search  of the putative amino acid binding site sequence of 2g <dig> in e. coli  <cit>  against e. chaffeensis  genome identified only one significant match  with e. chaffeensis rnap σ <dig> polypeptide, rpod.

in support of testing the functionality of p28-omp <dig> and p28-omp <dig> gene promoters, we constructed in vitro transcription templates, prg <dig> and prg <dig>  by cloning the promoter regions of the genes into the pmt <dig> plasmid . the plasmid pmt <dig> is a g-less cassette containing two transcription templates cloned in opposite directions to aid in driving transcription from promoters introduced upstream of the g-less cassette sequences  <cit> .  the functionality of the promoters of p28-omp <dig> and p28-omp <dig> in correct orientation, in plasmids prg <dig> and prg <dig>  was initially confirmed using e. coli holoenzyme containing its σ <dig> polypeptide . subsequently, transcriptional activity of the heparin-agarose purified rnap fractions was evaluated. e. chaffeensis rnap activity was detected in purified pooled fractions . the purified enzyme is completely inhibited in the presence of anti-σ <dig> monoclonal antibody, 2g <dig>  or in the presence of rifampicin . further characterization using varying salt concentrations showed that the enzyme was active in presence of potassium acetate up to  <dig> mm concentration and was inhibited at  <dig> mm , and the optimum concentration for activity of the enzyme for sodium chloride was observed at  <dig> mm .

in vitro transcription by recombinant e. chaffeensis-σ70
we reconstituted e. coli rnap core enzyme with recombinantly expressed e. chaffeensis σ <dig> and the resulting holoenzyme effectively transcribed the promoters of p28-omp <dig> and p29-omp <dig> , but the core enzyme alone or recombinant e. chaffeensis σ <dig> alone did not drive the transcription. saturation of the purified enzyme with recombinant σ <dig> also resulted in enhanced transcriptional signals . general transcriptional profile of both the reconstituted enzymes in the presence of varying potassium acetate concentrations were similar , although a relatively stronger transcriptional signal at  <dig> mm salt concentration was detected for e. coli core enzyme saturated with e. chaffeensis recombinant σ <dig> subunit .

modulation of e. chaffeensis rnap activity by whole-cell protein
we evaluated the effect of e. chaffeensis whole-cell protein lysate, prepared from the bacteria grown in macrophage cell line, on transcription of p28-omp <dig> and p28-omp <dig> constructs using the native purified enzyme. the resulting transcripts were analyzed by two independent methods; densitometry of radiolabeled transcripts and the taq-man probe-based, real-time rt-pcr. these analyses showed enhanced transcriptional activity in the presence of  <dig> μg of e. chaffeensis whole-cell lysate. densitometric analysis revealed a  <dig> -fold increase in transcriptional signal for the p28-omp <dig> promoter construct and a  <dig> -fold increase for p28-omp <dig> construct . addition of the same amount of protein yielded a similar fold increases when transcription was assessed with e. coli core enzyme saturated with e. chaffeensis recombinant σ <dig>  no transcription occurred with the addition of whole-cell lysate alone in the absence of an enzyme, a potential source of e. chaffeensis rnap. similarly, the addition of boiled lysate did not cause any change in transcriptional signals. quantitation by real-time rt-pcr for the calculation of fold increase in transcription in the presence of e. chaffeensis whole-cell protein lysate was carried out as described previously  <cit> . transcription of p28-omp <dig> construct with purified e. chaffeensis rnap, as quantified by real-time rt-pcr, showed a  <dig>  fold enhancement in the presence of  <dig> μg of the protein lysate, whereas transcription of p28-omp <dig> promoter construct resulted in a  <dig>  fold-enhancement , indicating a higher degree of agreement between the data generated by densitometric and real-time rt-pcr methods of quantitation .

emsa analysis of upstream sequences of p28-omp <dig> and p28-omp <dig> promoters
electrophoretic mobility shift assay  experiments utilizing the complete promoter regions of the p28-omp <dig> and p28-omp <dig> of e. chaffeensis showed promoter-specific binding of tick cell- or macrophage-derived e. chaffeensis proteins . addition of  <dig> ng of specific competitor dnas consisting of unlabeled full length promoter dna of p28-omp <dig> or p28-omp <dig> abolished the shift of dna-protein complex migration for both promoter regions. to further assess the interactions of ehrlichia proteins with putative upstream sequences, five biotin-labelled short upstream dna segments of p28-omp <dig>   and two dna segments of p28-omp <dig>   promoters were prepared and used in the emsa experiments. the promoter sequences of genes  <dig> and  <dig> included direct repeats and palindromic sequences  <cit> . the probes included one or more of the sequences. three of the five probes for the p28-omp <dig> promoter region exhibited significant shift in mobility in the presence of protein lysate from macrophage derived e. chaffeensis compared to the controls which contained probe alone with no lysate added or when non-specific protein was added to the probe fragments . a shift in mobility was also noted in the interaction with one probe segment of the p28-omp <dig> promoter region when the protein lysate was added . addition of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled specific-competitors in the binding reactions significantly reduced the mobility shift of the probes. densitometry analysis of the mobility shifted fragments differed for each probe compared to the non-shifted fragments. the p <dig> probe had 84% shift which reduced to 29% when competitor dna was added; p <dig> and p <dig> probes had about 31%, and 27% shifts, respectively, and the shifts for these probes were completely abolished in the presence of specific competitors. the p28-omp <dig> promoter region probe had about 23% shift which was reduced to 10% in the presence of specific competitor.

discussion
a major impediment to the study of regulation of gene expression in the human monocytic ehrlichiosis pathogen, e. chaffeensis, is the absence of an experimental genetic manipulation system due to the inability to stably transform the organism. to partially overcome this constraint, we constructed plasmid transcription templates by transcriptional fusion of p28-omp <dig> and p28-omp <dig> promoters to a g-less transcriptional template and isolated e. chaffeensis rnap to create a system for transcriptional analysis in vitro, similar to studies reported for chlamydia species  <cit> . we adapted the bacterial rnap purification methods reported in the literature  <cit>  to recover functionally active e. chaffeensis rnap. the procedure has been modified from a single-column purification method used for rnap from e. coli, bacillus subtilis, chlamydia trachomatis, rickettsia prowazekii and to recover the enzymes from several other bacterial organisms  <cit> . the purification steps involved the use of sodium deoxycholate, a bile salt often used in cell lysis but reportedly effective in the isolation of membrane proteins and in affinity chromatography by preventing non-specific binding  <cit> . this property may be critical for the recovery of active enzyme, since previous studies in r. prowazekii, a closely related species, showed that up to 62% of total rnap activity was associated with membrane proteins  <cit> . the heparin-agarose purification step is known to remove rnap inhibitors and endogenous dna  <cit> . the recovered e. chaffeensis enzyme showed transcriptional activity for both p28-omp <dig> and p28-omp <dig> promoters and marked the first study describing rnap activity of e. chaffeensis. sds-page profile suggested that the enzyme is partially pure and e. chaffeensis rnap has a typical bacterial holoenzyme composition with five major subunits, α <dig>  β, β', and σ.

the enhanced rnap activity following addition of e. chaffeensis recombinant sigma  <dig> suggests that the preparation had less than stoichiometric amounts of the sigma factor, which is consistent with findings of the recovery of e. coli rnap when employing similar procedures  <cit> . previous studies suggest that rnaps purified by heparin-agarose chromatography methods are only about 30% saturated with the major sigma factor, σ <dig>  <cit>  and do not co-purify with alternative sigma factors, such as a σ <dig> homolog  <cit> .

in this study, we presented evidence that the major e. chaffeensis sigma subunit, σ <dig>  was also recognized by a heterologous e. coli anti-σ <dig> monoclonal antibody, 2g <dig>  functional studies with the 2g <dig> suggest that this antibody can effectively inhibit in vitro transcriptional activity of e. coli  <cit>  and c. trachomatis rnap holoenzymes  <cit> . similarly, this antibody inhibited the e. chaffeensis rnap activity. these data are consistent with our bioinformatic analysis that the putative 2g <dig> antibody binding site sequences of e. coli and e. chaffeensis σ <dig> subunits of rnap share high degree of homology. transcriptional inhibition of the enzyme by the anti- σ70monoclonal antibody and rifampin, a potent inhibitor of prokaryotic rnap  <cit> , demonstrates that the in vitro transcriptional activity in our study was due to the isolated e. chaffeensis rnap.

transcriptional profiles depicting salt tolerance of purified enzymes have been described for prokaryotes, such as, c. trachomatis and e. coli  <cit> . in e. coli, transcription of a σ70-regulated promoter decreases dramatically between  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm potassium acetate  <cit> , whereas σ66-dependent promoter activity of chlamydia is completely inhibited at  <dig> mm concentration  <cit> . the purified e. chaffeensis rnap, reported in this study, also showed a similar range of salt tolerance as observed for other bacterial σ <dig> dependent rnaps. for example, the enzyme showed optimum transcriptional activity at  <dig> mm sodium chloride, a slight difference from the optimal  <dig> mm concentration reported for the r. prowazekii rnap  <cit> . the minor differences in the salt tolerance properties may be unique to e. chaffeensis rnap.

previous studies suggest that rnap fractions purified by heparin-agarose chromatography methods are typically about 30% saturated with the major sigma subunit  <cit> . thus the presence of free core enzymes in the preparation allows reconstitution studies or saturation with recombinant sigma factors to enhance transcription in vitro. thus we prepared a purified recombinant e. chaffeensis σ <dig> subunit and used for assessing transcriptional activity by saturation of the native enzyme or by reconstitution with e. coli core enzyme. saturation of the purified rnap with the recombinant subunit resulted in enhanced transcriptional signals. reconstitution of e. coli core enzyme with e. chaffeensis recombinant σ <dig> subunit had similar salt sensitivities to that of purified e. chaffeensis rnap before and after saturating with the recombinant subunit. these data are consistent with earlier reports indicating that purified c. psittacci σ <dig> was effective in stimulating transcription by c. trachomatis and c. psittaci rnap preparations  <cit>  and highlights that e. coli core enzyme reconstituted with e. chaffeensis sigma factor offers an alternative approach to in vitro characterization of e. chaffeensis promoters as described for c. trachomatis  <cit> . previously, we and others reported the use of e. coli system in characterizing the promoters of e. chaffeensis  <cit> . the current study offers an additional advantage over the e. coli system in that it uses e. chaffeensis rnap or e. coli core enzyme with e. chaffeensis recombinant σ <dig> 

regulation of gene transcription in prokaryotes involves a complex network and is controlled at the stage of rna synthesis in which transcription factors  are key components  <cit> . tfs play an important role in regulating the transcription of specific genes by acting on the dna regulatory sequences within the gene promoters  <cit> . when a transcription factor binds to a specific promoter, it can either activate or repress transcription  <cit> . to investigate the possible modulatory role of e. chaffeensis proteins on transcription of promoters of two differentially expressed genes, p28-omp <dig> and p28-omp <dig>  we prepared e. chaffeensis whole-cell protein lysate from macrophage-derived bacteria and evaluated its effect on transcription in vitro. addition of the macrophage cell infection-derived e. chaffeensis protein extracts resulted in enhanced transcription suggesting that promoters of the p28-omp <dig> and p28-omp <dig> genes may be regulated in response to changing environments of the pathogen. importantly, the enhanced in vitro transcription observed in this study in response to addition of protein extracts suggests that the lysates contain transcription regulators. given the differential expression of p28-omp <dig> and p28-omp <dig> genes  <cit>  in vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, the hypothesis that promoters of these genes may be under both positive and negative regulation in response to the changing host environments is also plausible. this hypothesis requires additional investigations, including the evaluation of the impact of tick cell environment. as an organism may express diverse array of transcription factors, it is highly likely that e. chaffeensis may regulate its gene expression via modulating the expression of transcription factors in support of maintaining its existence in dual hosts. transcription regulation of a gene is a dynamic process and is responsive to environmental cues under which tfs trigger regulation  <cit> . this study shows the first evidence of stimulatory effect of e. chaffeensis whole-cell protein extract on the transcription of both p28-omp <dig> and p28-omp <dig> promoters in vitro. in our previous studies, we reported that the expression levels of the p28-omp <dig> and p28-omp <dig> genes are different in macrophage and tick cell environments  <cit> . although both the genes are transcriptionally active in macrophage host cell environment under in vitro and in vivo conditions, the expression levels for p28-omp <dig> is higher for the bacteria in infected macrophages, whereas in tick cells p28-omp <dig> is the predominantly expressed protein  <cit> . consistent with those observations, the promoter constructs of both p28-omp <dig> and p28-omp <dig> genes remained active and enhanced when e. chaffeensis protein lysates prepared from macrophage culture derived organisms were added. additional investigations are needed to further define the differences in the expression levels for the p28-omp <dig> and p28-omp <dig> genes in macrophage and tick cell environments. a gene in a cell may be regulated by different tfs, and the contribution from different tfs may be variable under different environmental conditions  <cit> . thus, more detailed investigations are needed to map quantitative differences in the transcription and to further assess the complex regulatory network of transcription in e. chaffeensis.

the current study provides the first evidence suggesting that e. chaffeensis whole-cell protein lysates contain regulatory proteins which modulate transcription of p28-omp <dig> and p28-omp <dig> promoters in vitro. in support of further testing the hypothesis that e. chaffeensis whole-cell protein lysates contain proteins that bind to putative regulatory dna sequences of these promoters, emsa experiments were performed. a shift in mobility of dna fragments was observed for several partial or complete dna segments of the promoter regions of both p28-omp <dig> and p28-omp <dig> genes. these data suggest that the promoter region contained regulatory dna sequences that allowed binding of one or more e. chaffeensis proteins. the binding was specific as the addition of specific competitors considerably reduced the shift and the addition of a non-specific protein did not cause a shift. the binding of e. chaffeensis regulatory proteins to the dna segments spanning putative dna binding elements is consistent with previous studies on this organism  <cit>  as well as in several other bacteria, including anaplasma phagocytophilum  <cit> , c. trachomatis  <cit> and b. subtilis  <cit> in which interaction of regulatory proteins with regulatory sequences have been demonstrated. the identity of dna binding proteins and the location of protein binding sites remain to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we developed in vitro transcription assays using a g-less cassette and described methods to isolate native rnap and the recombinant rnap σ <dig> subunit of e. chaffeensis. the value of using these tools in evaluating the promoters of two differentially expressed genes has been demonstrated. the application of these tools to the study of e. chaffeensis is new and important for furthering our understanding of the regulation of gene expression in this pathogen. specifically, the tools will be valuable in studies to map specific interactions of e. chaffeensis proteins in driving differential gene expression influenced by vertebrate and tick host cell environments. this is the first report of in vitro transcription using native e. chaffeensis rnap and e. coli rnap core enzyme reconstituted with the recombinant e. chaffeensis σ <dig> subunit. this study marks the beginning of a greater effort to broadly characterize the mechanisms that control the transcription in anaplasmataceae pathogens in support of their growth in vertebrate and tick hosts.
