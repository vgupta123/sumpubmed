BACKGROUND
azo dyes are widely used in the textiles, leather, plastics, cosmetics, and food industries, with a global annual production of more than  <dig>  tons. approximately 10% of azo products are discharged into the environment, resulting in a negative impact on the environment and human health because most azo dyes are carcinogenic, teratogenic, and highly persistent in the environment  <cit> . conventional physicochemical methods for treating azo dyes have severe limitations, including incomplete removal, formation of hazardous products, and high operation costs, and biological techniques enable complete mineralization of the azo dye in a more environmentally friendly and cost-effective manner  <cit> . azo dyes are not readily degraded by biological methods under aerobic conditions, and thus, they are normally decolorized by reductive cleavage of the azo bonds  under anaerobic conditions and then converted to aromatic amines, which are subsequently mineralized aerobically  <cit> . the decolorization process is typically rate-limiting, which hinders the biological treatment of azo dyes  <cit> .

zero valent iron  can enhance anaerobic microbial azo reduction, but the exact mechanism of fe0-assisted microbial reduction remains unclear  <cit> . because azo dyes are decolorized by functional microorganisms, characterizing the fe0-assisted decolorization of azo dyes using a pure decolorizing bacterium may provide some exact information about the reaction mechanism, and understanding how the microbes interacts with fe <dig> will facilitate the elucidation of the mechanisms of enhancement and optimize the biodecolorization process.

fe <dig> is a mild reducer and can chemically reduce several azo dyes under acidic and neutral conditions  <cit> . furthermore, iron is an essential element for microbial survival because the active sites of diverse vital enzymes and proteins contain iron  <cit> . microorganisms may regulate the iron redox reaction by cellular assimilation of iron. meanwhile, fe <dig> can produce cathodic h <dig> during the anaerobic corrosion process, and h <dig> is a favorable electron donor for microbial azo reduction  <cit> . according to the following equation  <dig> fe0+2h2o→fe2++h2+2oh‐ 

fe2+, oh−, and h <dig> are the products of the anaerobic corrosion process  <cit> . the electrode potential of the redox couple fe2+/fe <dig> is − <dig>  v, and hydrogen production from corrosion exhibits autocatalytic behavior, attaining a maximum rate of  <dig>  mol kg− <dig> d− <dig> over  <dig> d of reaction in a study by reardon et al.  <cit> . based on these knowledge, it is hypothesized that anaerobic fe <dig> corrosion may be accelerated in the azo dye biodecolorizing system, then  the microenvironmental conditions are altered to produce more favorable redox/ph conditions for the growth of microbes;  the additional electron donor  from fe <dig> corrosion facilitates a greater microbial biomass yield; and  the activity of the azo-reducing bacteria is stimulated by the supplementary elemental iron, resulting in the acceleration of the azo bioreduction.

to test these hypotheses, s. decolorationis s <dig>  an azo-reducing bacterium isolated from a textile wastewater treatment system  <cit> , was used as a model organism to characterize the enhancement of microbial azo reduction by fe <dig> in this study. specifically, we investigated  the effect of fe <dig> dosage on the decolorization rate, ph change, and h <dig> release to determine whether fe <dig> affects azo reduction by strain s <dig> indirectly;  the morphology of fe solids outside and inside the cells to determine whether a direct interaction between microbes and fe <dig> occurs in the decolorization process; and  the effect of fe <dig> addition on the ratio of live versus dead cells and protein contents to determine whether the addition of fe <dig> influences the growth and survival ability of strain s <dig>  this study provides new insights into our understanding of the interactions between fe <dig> and microbial cells in the decolorization process and lays a foundation for further optimization of fe0-microbial integrated processes for efficient azo dye treatment.

methods
chemicals, organism, media, and cultivation
amaranth , a typical water-soluble azo dye, was purchased from sigma . s. decolorationis s <dig> is a rod-shaped, gram-positive facultative bacterium that was isolated from the activated sludge of a textile-printing wastewater treatment plant by xu et al.  <cit> .

strain s <dig> was cultivated by transferring a single colony to a 100-ml conical flask containing 50 ml of luria-bertani medium , which was then incubated in a shaking incubator  at 30°c. the cells were harvested in the middle of exponential growth phase  by centrifugation, washed twice with phosphate buffer , and re-suspended in the buffer prior to inoculation. the cells were inoculated into a defined medium  containing na2hpo <dig>   <dig>  g/l; kh2po <dig>   <dig>  g/l; nh4cl,  <dig>  g/l; nacl,  <dig>  g/l; sodium lactate,  <dig>  mm; yeast extract,  <dig>  g/l; and amaranth,  <dig>  mm. the initial cell density was approximately 107 cfu/ml . the cells were statically cultivated at 30°c in an anaerobic workstation . standard anaerobic technique was used throughout the study for anaerobic cultivation as previously described  <cit> . the medium was prepared by adding concentrated stock solutions containing various medium components in o2-free distilled water. the medium was then bubbled with n <dig> gas for 10 min to remove residual air from the head space. all gases used were passed through a  <dig> -μm filter prior to use. all batch experiments were conducted in 100-ml serum bottles with a culture medium volume of 40 ml under anaerobic conditions. three independent experiments with triplicate bacterial samples were performed in each experiment.

micrometer-sized iron  particles  were obtained from tianjin guangfu technology and development co., ltd., china, and were pretreated by rinsing with 1 m hcl for 3 min, followed by washing with distilled water for 1 min. different dosages of fe <dig>  were added to the defined medium  to examine the effect of fe <dig> dosage on the decolorization reaction. the cell-free abiotic control  received 60 mm fe <dig>  for the other tests, the dosage of fe <dig> particles was maintained at 60 mm. before and after decolorization , the size  of the particles was determined using dynamic light scattering in a laser particle size analyzer .

growth and activity assays of microbial cells
cells were grown in medium with and without 60 mm fe <dig> for 12 h and then collected for cell yield and activity assays, including protein content and live/dead ratio. the protein content was determined by the coomassie brilliant blue method  <cit>  with slight modification. briefly, naoh solution  was added to the serum bottle containing the cell culture in 40 ml of medium, and the mixture was incubated in a water bath for 10 min at 95-99°c with gentle end-over-end inversion every 2 min. after centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for 5 min, the supernatant was collected in a new centrifuge tube at room temperature and reacted with bradford solution containing  <dig> %  coomassie brilliant blue g- <dig>   <dig> %  ethanol, and  <dig> %  phosphoric acid for 10 min prior to measuring the absorbance at 595 nm. bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.

a lsm <dig> laser scanning confocal microscope  was used to examine the activity of s. decolorationis s <dig> after a 12-h reaction. a rapid fluorescence staining method using the live/dead baclight™ viability kit  was applied to estimate both the viable and total counts of bacteria according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol.

tem and sem analyses
transmission electron microscopy  and scanning electron microscopy  with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy  were used to observe the structures of the bacterial cells and the iron precipitates. bacterial cell samples were collected for tem analysis after a 12-h incubation, and fe <dig> samples for sem analysis were collected after a 30-h incubation. the suspended bacterial cells and fe <dig> samples were collected separately. the cell pellet was separated from the medium by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for 5 min, and the pellet  was washed twice with  <dig>  m phosphate buffer before fixation in 3% glutaraldehyde for 5 h. then, the pellet was washed twice with phosphate buffer and dehydrated in a gradient series of ethanol solutions from  <dig> to 100% by incubation at each ethanol concentration for 15 min. for tem analysis, the sample was treated with acetone and embedded in epoxy resin. thin sections  were cut with a diamond knife mounted on a leica em uc <dig> ultramicrotome and collected on carbon-coated cu grids. tem observation was performed with a jeol jem-2010hr tem at 200 kv or a hitachi h- <dig> tem at 80 kv. for sem observation, the sample was treated with tert-butanol and then freeze dried. after sputtering with gold, the sample was deposited on the cu carrier and observed with either a hitachi h-3000 n sem or a fei quanta 400 f sem. the eds measurement was performed with an oxford inca edx spectrometer coupled with a jeol jem-2010hr tem or an fei quanta 400 f sem.

chemical analysis and calculation
the ph of the solution was measured using a digital multi-parameter  <dig> meter . the fe2+ concentration in the aqueous phase was measured using the hcl extraction ferrozine assay method as previously described  <cit> . the h <dig> concentration in the medium after a 12-h reaction was examined by hydrogen microelectrodes  polarized at +1000 mv.

the decolorization of amaranth was measured by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at a wavelength of 520 nm with a beckman du <dig> uv/visible spectrophotometer. the decolorization rate and efficiency were calculated as follows: decolorizationrate%=a–b/a×100%  decolorizationefficiencymmoll‐1h‐1=decolorizationrate×c/t 

where a is the initial absorbance, b is the absorbance after the reaction, c is the initial concentration of amaranth , and t is the decolorization reaction time . all assays were performed in triplicate.

statistical analysis was conducted with office excel  <dig>  origin v <dig> , and spss v <dig>   software. treatment p values <  <dig>  were considered significant.

RESULTS
effects of fe <dig> on azo dye decolorization by strain s12
to confirm that fe <dig> enhanced the anaerobic bioreduction of azo dye, decolorization by strain s <dig> was performed at six different dosages  of fe <dig> at ph  <dig>  . the amaranth was completely decolorized in 30 h, except in the treatment without strain s <dig> cells, suggesting that strain s <dig> was the major azo reducer and that no observable direct reaction between fe <dig> and amaranth occurred. in the presence of increasing doses of fe <dig>  the complete decolorization time for strain s <dig> rapidly reduced from  <dig> to 12 h, and the decolorization efficiency increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mmol l−1 h− <dig> . in addition, the decolorization efficiencies of the fe0-added systems were much higher than those of the fe0-free systems , demonstrating that the addition of fe <dig> enhanced the biodecolorization of azo dyes. this phenomenon might be attributable to the h <dig> supply from the cathodic corrosion of fe <dig>  based on equation , h <dig> is generated during the anaerobic corrosion of fe <dig> figure  <dig> effect of fe <dig> dosage on the decolorization of azo dyes by s. decolorationis s <dig>   the time course of the decolorization rate at different fe <dig> dosages.  decolorization efficiency and h <dig> concentration at different fe <dig> dosages after a 12-h reaction.



to determine if the h <dig> evolved from fe <dig> can serve as an electron donor for strain s <dig> during the decolorization process, the concentration of h <dig> in the experimental systems after 12-h reactions with different fe <dig> dosages was determined. as shown in figure 1b, the h <dig> concentration increased with fe <dig> dosage in both the presence and absence of strain s <dig> , indicating that h <dig> was generated from the anaerobic corrosion of fe <dig>  however, the h <dig> concentrations in the presence of strain s <dig> were significantly lower than those measured in the cell-free tests , suggesting that the produced h <dig> was consumed as an electron donor by strain s <dig> during azo reduction. in addition, as shown in figure 1b, the dosage of fe <dig> was a rate-limiting parameter for azo reduction when the dosage of fe <dig> was less than 40 mm, which could be due to the limited h <dig> supply for strain s <dig>  however, when the dosage of fe <dig> was greater than 40 mm, the supply of h <dig> became adequate, and the decolorization efficiency reached a steady state. this study thus confirmed the presence of a dosage threshold for fe <dig>  for strain s <dig> in azo reduction. previous study of the effect of fe <dig> dosage on hexavalent chromium and carbon tetrachloride removal also reported a dosage threshold for fe <dig> due to the h <dig> supply  <cit> .

furthermore, we also measured the fe2+ concentrations in the absence and presence of strain s <dig> cells in the presence of 60 mm fe <dig>  because fe2+ is one of the products of anaerobic fe <dig> corrosion. after a 30-h incubation, the fe2+ concentration in the experiments with strain s <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol l− <dig>  which was significantly higher than that of the abiotic control  , suggesting that strain s <dig> promoted the dissolution of fe <dig> particles. the same phenomenon was also observed by de windt et al.  <cit>  for anoxic fe <dig> corrosion coupled with nitrate reduction by s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  the mechanism of fe <dig> consumption remains unclear. there were two likely explanations:  the consumption of h <dig> released from the fe <dig> surface by strain s <dig> allowed the reaction described in equation  to occur and shift to the right, or  strain s <dig> reacted with fe <dig> directly  and accelerated the transformation of iron. the data in this study indicate that both explanations are correct and complementary, but more work is needed to clarify the exact mechanism.

to further examine the changes in the microenvironment around strain s <dig> and fe <dig>  we detected ph changes during the biodecolorization process in the absence and presence of 60 mm fe <dig> conditions with an initial strain s <dig> cells of 107 cfu/ml . generally, the ph value decreased in the decolorization process both in the absence and presence of fe <dig> conditions, with the lowest ph values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  at 24 h, respectively. this decrease in ph is likely due to the production of acetate by lactate oxidation as well as proton release during azo reduction  <cit> . notably, higher ph values were observed in the systems with fe <dig> than in the fe0-free tests , which could be due to a buffering effect of oh− from the corrosion of fe <dig> based on equation . slight changes in the microenvironmental ph around the cells can lead to variations in the activity and stability of enzymes and proteins  participating in growth and decolorization  <cit> , implying that the improved ph buffer capability of the fe0-microbial system may also contribute to enhance azo reduction. similar results have been reported in other fe0-assisted biodecolorization studies  <cit> .figure  <dig> changes in ph during the biodecolorization process with/without fe <dig> 



shifts in the size distribution pattern of fe <dig> particles during biodecolorization
to measure the consumption of fe <dig> during biodecolorization, the change in the size distribution of the fe <dig> particles before and after decolorization was characterized using dynamic light scattering  in the systems inoculated with strain s <dig> and 60 mm fe <dig> at ph  <dig>  . the percentages of small-sized  and large-sized  iron particles dramatically increased from  <dig> % to  <dig> % and  <dig> % to  <dig> %, respectively, while the percentage of medium-sized particles  decreased from  <dig> % to  <dig> % after decolorization. this trend was consistent with the sem analysis of the particles, which revealed that after a 30-h biological azo reduction, the medium-sized particles with rough surfaces disappeared, and the large-sized particles with smooth surfaces formed clusters . the surfaces of the fe <dig> clusters were further analyzed by eds, and fe, o, p, and c were detected as the primary elements . according to equation , this result may be due to the formation of ferrous iron precipitates  <dig>  fe <dig>  and feco3) that attached to the surface of fe <dig>  <cit> . these observations confirmed that partially solid fe <dig> was consumed during the biodecolorization process.figure  <dig> shifts in the size distribution pattern of the fe <dig> particles during the biodecolorization process.



effects of fe <dig> on cell morphology and viability
we observed that the growth and viability of strain s <dig> were affected by added fe <dig>  and we investigated the mechanism by which fe <dig> significantly promoted azo reduction. to evaluate cell growth, we measured the biomass yield  in the presence of 60 mm fe <dig> and in the fe0-free control after cultivation for 12 h. the protein mass in the fe0-supplemented culture was nearly twice more than that in the culture without fe <dig>  indicating that added fe <dig> can promote the growth of strain s <dig>  . as an additional electron donor provided by fe <dig> corrosion, h <dig> likely contributed to this growth promotion. the bacterial cell morphology and viability after incubation with and without fe <dig>  for 12 h were evaluated by clsm and tem. clsm analysis revealed more live  cells in the presence of fe <dig> than in the control . the live/dead ratio of strain s <dig> in the fe <dig> culture was approximately  <dig> -fold higher than that in the culture without fe <dig> , indicating that the presence of fe <dig> was beneficial for maintaining cell viability . clsm also revealed that strain s <dig> cells were attached to the surfaces of the micro-scale fe <dig> particles , suggesting that strain s <dig> decolorized azo dyes in both the aqueous and solid phases. bacterial cell appendages , which were observed in strain s <dig>  and confirmed by the genome sequence  <cit> , played an important role in adhesion to the micro-scale fe <dig> particles. other shewanella spp., such as s. alga, s. putrefaciens and s. oneidensis, also grow adhering to iron minerals  <cit> .figure  <dig> live/dead ratios and protein masses of bacteria with/without fe <dig>  for the t-test, *, p value <  <dig> ; **, p value <  <dig> .



the tem/eds images demonstrated differences in cell morphology in the fe0-supplemented culture  and the control . in the fe0-supplemented culture, extracellular and/or intracellular fine-grained fe precipitates or clusters formed outside and/or inside the cell membrane  . these results indicated direct interactions between fe <dig> and strain s <dig>  providing good evidences for microbial-driven biogeochemical cycling. these direct interactions promoted the transformation of iron as well as the removal of contaminants. first, for contaminant removal, fe precipitates provided more fe sources for the synthesis of enzymes and thus enhanced microbial activity. elemental iron assimilated by strain s <dig> was an active ingredient for multiple dehydrogenases and hydrogenases , ensuring higher cell physiological and azoreductive activities  <cit> . second, strain s <dig> cells, which were attached to the surface of fe <dig>  coupled the consumption of h <dig>  and the reduction of azo dye by azo respiration. for iron transformation, the process included several steps as follows:  fe2+ released from fe <dig> corrosion and reversibly adhered to the surface of fe <dig> or strain s <dig> cells;  fe2+-containing precipitates formed  <dig>  fe <dig>  feco3) when anions presented, and  the small size and high surface-to-volume ratio of fine-grained particles  enabled significant adsorption of fe precipitates to the outer membrane of strain s <dig> cells and the intracellular uptake of fe precipitates to the cytoplasm of strain s <dig> cells. fe <dig> corrosion was accelerated because the concentration of fe2+ was diluted by strain s <dig> through steps  and , suggesting that strain s <dig> contributed to the transformation of iron, although a quantitative analysis could not be performed here. the biosorption of fe precipitates has also been observed for other shewanella spp.  <cit>  and dehalococcoides spp.  <cit>  involved in fe0-assisted bioremediation, revealing universal direct interactions between bacteria and minerals during containment removal  <cit> .

mechanisms of fe0-assisted biodecolorization
we propose a conceptual model for the fe0-assisted azo dye reduction process by s. decolorationis s <dig> . in the model, four sections  explain the mechanism. in section i, the cells of strain s <dig>  which use the azo bond as the terminal acceptor to complete anaerobic respiration, attach to the surface of the micrometer-scale iron particles. in section ii, fe <dig> reacts with h2o in a neutral-ph, anaerobic environment and produces h <dig> and oh−. strain s <dig> cells utilize h <dig> as an electron donor and energy source for growth. in addition, the oh− generated from fe <dig> erosion neutralizes the h+ released from bacterial metabolism, maintaining the proper ph for microbial growth. in section iii, the strain s <dig> cells accelerate the dissolution of iron particles due to the consumption of h <dig>  resulting in the generation of nanometer-scale particles and a higher concentration of fe2+. in section iv, nanometer-scale fe precipitates adsorb to the surface of the outer membranes and are transported inside the strain s <dig> cells, improving cell growth and maintenance of viability. the cellular physiological analyses in this study suggest that the addition of fe <dig> enhances protein content and bacterial activity. potential functional proteins and pathways for bacterial azo respiration in the presence of fe <dig> are shown in figure 6b, although further work is needed to verify their involvement.figure  <dig> proposed model for fe0-assisted azo decolorization by s. decolorationis s <dig>   four sections  of fe0-assisted azo biodecolorization.  magnification of section iv in . note: b = bacterium; am = amaranth; rps = reductive products of amaranth; azor = azoreductase; h2ase = hydrogenase; ldhase = lactate dehydrogenase; cyt = cytochrome protein.



CONCLUSIONS
the results of batch experiments of azo decolorization by combining the use of fe <dig> and the azo-reducing bacterium s. decolorationis strain s <dig> expanded our knowledge of the enhancement of microbial azo reduction by fe <dig>  a conceptual model for fe0-assisted microbial azo reduction was established based on the direct and indirect interactions between microbes and fe <dig> after characterizing the changes in the morphology of the fe <dig> particles, the physiological activities of the bacteria, and the physicochemical properties of the azo reduction system. this model will facilitate the development of azo dye remediation technology. however, to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying these processes, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses should be performed to track the dynamics and adaptive responses of strain s <dig> during fe0-assisted azo reduction processes.
