BACKGROUND
the european red mite, panonychus ulmi, is a member of the family tetranychidae . tetranychidae, or spider mites, use their stylet- like chelicerae to puncture the leaf mesophyll-cells to suck out cell contents. this results in chlorotic spots and necrosis and ultimately, leaf abscission  <cit> . as a result, among mite pests, spider mites are economically important with 80 % of the acaricide market used for their control  <cit> . nonetheless, a major problem associated with spider mite control is the rapid development of acaricide resistance. factors accelerating resistance evolution include not only the frequent use of acaricides, but also high fecundity rates, arrhenotokous reproduction  and a short life cycle  <cit> . as a result, the two-spotted spider mite  and p. ulmi have developed resistance to nearly all acaricide classes  <cit>  and rank among the top  <dig> of most resistant arthropod species based on the number of unique active ingredients for which resistance has been reported  <cit> .

the acaricides spirodiclofen and spiromesifen belong, together with the insecticide spirotetramat, to the family of spirocyclic tetronic acids  and interrupt lipid biosynthesis by direct inhibition of acetyl coenzyme a carboxylase   <cit> . introduced relatively recently to the market  <cit> , spirodiclofen has been shown to be an effective tool in resistance management of tetranychid mites. it shows good to excellent residual control  <cit>  and is effective against spider mites resistant to different acaricide classes . although high levels of spirodiclofen resistance have not yet been reported in field populations, artificial selection studies have shown that spider mites have the potential to develop resistance to spirodiclofen comparatively rapid in the laboratory  <cit> . selection for resistance was undertaken with t. urticae, p. ulmi and p. citri and resistance in all species was synergized by piperonylbutoxide , suggesting the involvement of cytochrome p450s . strikingly, for all three tetranychid species spirodiclofen resistance was age dependent. the concentration of spirodiclofen causing 50 % lethality  in the resistant strains was much lower in eggs then in mobile stages, a finding demaeght et al.  <cit>  suggested could be due to lower expression of detoxification genes in eggs.

in  <dig>  the high quality genome sequence of the spider mite tetranychus urticae became available  <cit> , and afforded new resources and tools to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying acaricide resistance . for example, although biochemical studies had shown that elevated p <dig> and esterase levels were associated with resistance to spirodiclofen in t. urticae , studies with a genome-wide gene expression microarray allowed the identification of the genes coding for the detoxification enzymes associated with these activities   <cit> . it is clear that our understanding of resistance to acaricides in phytophagous mites improved with the advent of the t. urticae genome, however, such genomic resources are scarce for other key tetranychid mites, particularly p. ulmi. with only  <dig> nucleotide sequences available in the ncbi public database , p. ulmi resistance research at the molecular level has hardly been possible.

for organisms without a sequenced genome, de novo transcriptome assemblies provide an important starting point for genomic analyses, and recent advances in high-throughput transcript sequencing have greatly contributed to our understanding of gene expression and structure . this is especially true in agricultural pest management, where the majority of pest species do not have a reference genome and where the elucidation of resistance mechanisms of insecticides is vital .

in this study we used the illumina hiseq <dig> technology to generate deep paired-end, strand-specific rna-seq reads for two strains of p. ulmi. the first strain  is susceptible to most currently used acaricides, while the second strain  was field collected and shown to be resistant to a number of acaricides, including hexythiazox and clofentezine. the strain also showed decreased susceptibility to spirodiclofen, and was further selected in the laboratory until high levels of spirodiclofen resistance  were reached  <cit> . paired-end rnaseq reads were used to assemble a p. ulmi transcriptome, and with the same assembly methodology we constructed two p. citri transcriptomes based on previously published rna-seq data available as single end reads  <cit> . we then performed a phylogenetic classification of panonychus gene families involved in detoxification, such as cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases , carboxylcholinesterases , glutathione-s-transferases , udp-glycosyl transferases  and abc transporters , and searched for horizontally transferred genes that were previously uncovered in the genome sequence of t. urticae . moreover, a differential expression analysis between the acaricide susceptible and resistant p. ulmi strain allowed us to identify genes encoding proteins that are candidates for involvement in acaricide resistance. in addition, we identified and compared p. ulmi expressed sequences for known acaricide target sites. the assembled annotated transcriptome of p. ulmi provides an important resource that should substantially facilitate molecular studies in this species, including the elucidation of detoxification mechanisms of xenobiotics.

RESULTS
de novo sequence assembly
we performed high-throughput illumina sequencing of rna extracted from adult females from acaricide susceptible  and resistant p. ulmi strains . with the illumina hiseq platform we generated  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> strand-specific paired-end reads for the hs and psr-tk p. ulmi strains, respectively. two approaches were used to assemble the p. ulmi transcriptome . the assembly created with clc genomics workbench  contains  <dig>  unique p. ulmi contigs longer than 200 bp, totalling  <dig>  mb of sequence with an overall gc content of  <dig>  %. the average contig size was 993 bp and the n <dig> was 2087 bp. the velvet/oases assembly, on the other hand, consists of  <dig>  transcripts totalling  <dig>  mb of sequence with a gc content of  <dig>  % and an average contig size/n <dig> of 619 bp/871 bp. mapping all rna-seq reads against both transcriptomes  revealed that the overall mapping success rate, as a measure for assembly quality, was significantly lower for the velvet/oases assembly compared to the clc assembly , with an average overall alignment rate of  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % for the clc and velvet/oases assembly, respectively. hence, unless otherwise stated, the clc assembly was used for all further analyses described in this study. all raw reads and the clc assembly were submitted to ncbi under bioproject prjna <dig> 

as the transcriptome assemblies of two previously published p. citri transcriptomes  <cit>  were not publicly available, and to generate assemblies with similar methodology, we assembled these transcriptomes in a similar way  as for p. ulmi . p. citri assembly statistics were in line with those of p. ulmi, with  <dig>  contigs and an average contig size/n <dig> of 708 bp/1057 bp for the liu et al.  <cit>  p. citri transcriptome and  <dig>  contigs and an average contig size/n <dig> of 646 bp/969 bp for the niu et al.  <cit>  p. citri transcriptome.

homology searches, species distribution and gene ontology  analysis
a total of  <dig> sequences  had a blast hit in the ncbi non-redundant  database, with  <dig> sequences having a blastx hit against the nr protein database and  <dig> sequences having a blastn hit against the nr nucleotide database. as t. urticae gene annotations have not yet been uploaded to the ncbi database, we also performed a local blastx search against the t. urticae proteome. we found that  <dig>  p. ulmi contigs showed a blastx hit with the predicted t. urticae proteome, including  <dig> that had no blastx-hit in the ncbi nr database. in total,  <dig>  p. ulmi contigs  had a blast-hit in at least one analysis . although  <dig>  % of contigs with a blast-hit may appear to be a relatively small number, we found that this value does not significantly differ from other de novo transcriptome studies with non-model arthropod species . in the niu et al. transcriptome study  <cit>  of the related p. citri the percentage of contigs was also of similar magnitude . such a low percentage can be caused by multiple reasons. the majority of de novo transcriptomes contains a considerable amount of short contigs , containing incomplete  orfs that in many cases will not blast at a given e-value threshold. on the other hand some contigs may be non-coding rnas which do not blast with the non-redundant protein/nucleotide database .

out of the contigs having a blast-hit,  <dig>  %  of the top blast hits belonged to metazoan species,  <dig>  % to bacteria ,  <dig>  %  to plants,  <dig>  %  to fungi and  <dig>  %  to other organisms. the highest homologies for the majority of the metazoan blast hits belonged to the chelicerata  and arthropoda  . a detailed analysis of all chelicerate blast hits revealed a high number of top blast hits with t. urticae , followed by the social velvet spider stegodyphus mimosarum , the tick ixodes scapularis  and the predatory mite metaseiulus occidentalis .

we performed a gene ontology  analysis of the p. ulmi assembled sequences after excluding contigs  that were considered as foreign contamination and consisted mainly of sequences belonging to wolbachia sp.  and the host plant  of the p. ulmi hs and psr-tk strains  . go terms were assigned to  <dig> unique contigs  and in most cases multiple go terms were assigned to the same p. ulmi contig. we found that  <dig>  ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  go terms emerged for biological process, cellular component and molecular function categories, respectively. those were further categorized into  <dig> biological process,  <dig> molecular function and  <dig> cellular component sub-categories . among the  <dig> sub-categories of biological process, the cellular process occupied the highest number , followed by the metabolic process , single organism process  and response to stimulus  . the major sub-categories of the molecular function category included binding , followed by catalytic activity  and transporter activity  . in the cellular component domain, the majority of the go terms were shown to be specific for the cell , followed by organelle  and macromolecular complex  . to further increase the annotation functionality, all contigs were mapped to the reference canonical pathways in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes . kegg mapping resulted in  <dig> contigs that were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways, with  <dig>  % of p. ulmi kegg enzymes identified as transferases,  <dig>  % as hydrolases,  <dig>  % as oxidoreductases,  <dig>  % as ligases,  <dig>  % as lyases, while isomerases constituted for  <dig>  % of annotated enzymes . our go and kegg analyses of the p. ulmi transcriptome are in line with previous go analyses of p. citri transcriptomes where cellular process, binding and cell were the three major sub-categories  <cit>  and indicates that our approach using the illumina hiseq platform provided an extensive representation of the p. ulmi transcriptome.fig.  <dig> gene ontology annotation and classification  of the p. ulmi transcriptome. results are summarized into three main categories: molecular function, biological process and cellular component. in total go terms were assigned to  <dig> p. ulmi contigs



analysis of panonychus genes involved in xenobiotic resistance
in general, arthropods have developed two types of mechanisms to cope with xenobiotic compounds, both of which can contribute to the development of resistance: mechanisms that decrease exposure due to quantitative or qualitative changes in major detoxification enzymes and transporters  and mechanisms that decrease sensitivity due to changes in target site sensitivity caused by point mutations   <cit> . the pharmacokinetic mechanism can be subdivided into three phases . in phase i detoxification enzymes such as cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases  and carboxylcholinesterases  incorporate a nucleophilic functional group  into the toxic compound, resulting in a more reactive and water soluble compound. during phase ii, enzymes such as udp-glycosyltransferases  and glutathione-s-transferases  further increase the water solubility of the phase i metabolite by conjugation with endogenous molecules like sugars and glutathione, respectively. in phase iii, conjugates are transported out of the cell by cellular transporters, e.g., abc transporters .

in this study we mined the p. ulmi and p. citri transcriptomes for genes encoding known target-sites and major detoxification enzymes and transporters  and compared them with those of t. urticae, for which a high-quality genomic assembly and annotation is available  <cit> . in addition, we also performed a phylogenetic analysis for all major detoxification gene families. it should be noted, however, that as transcriptomic data for panonychus sp. is compared to genomic data for t. urticae, care should be taken when comparing numbers and ortho/homologues of panonychus detoxification genes as recent gene duplications and genes with very low expression levels might be missed. in addition, expression of detoxification genes might also be stage-dependent. hence, gene number differences between both panonychus species should also be carefully interpreted as both p. citri transcriptomes were assembled using rna-seq data from mixed stages  <cit>  while the p. ulmi transcriptome was based solely on rna-seq data of adult females .

cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases
cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases  are heme-containing enzymes with a diverse range of functions. many p450s are important phase i detoxification enzymes with a crucial role in detoxification of plant secondary metabolites and in metabolizing insecticides/acaricides to less toxic compounds. four major clans can be distinguished in the cyp gene family, namely the cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and m   <cit> . the advent of the t. urticae genome allowed a first insight into the cyp gene family of a phytophagous mite, revealing  <dig> full length cyps. this number is similar to what is found in insects, but with an expansion of t. urticae specific intronless genes of the cyp <dig> clan  <cit> . a total of  <dig> p. ulmi and  <dig> p. citri cyp non-allelic orfs could be identified . only those cyps that did not misalign in the final alignment and had a minimum orf length of 450 nt were included in a phylogenetic analysis  . based on this analysis or based on its best blastx hit with a t. urticae cyp, all p. ulmi and p. citri cyps could be assigned to one of the  <dig> cyp clans   <cit> .table  <dig> comparison of the cyp gene number in t. urticae, p. ulmi and p. citri

in vertebrates, mitochondrial cyps  are associated with steroid or vitamin d metabolism while in insects this clan comprises two groups: one group involved in the ecdysteroid metabolism pathway and another group that metabolize a variety of xenobiotic compounds  <cit> . we identified  <dig> p. ulmi and  <dig> p. citri orfs in this clan and detected three clear cases of 1:1: <dig> orthology between p. ulmi, p. citri and t. urticae: cyp314a <dig>  cyp315a <dig> and cyp302a <dig> . together with t. urticae cyp307a <dig> of the cyp <dig> clan , these cyps are the only t. urticae cyps that could be assigned as clear orthologs of insect and crustacean cyps. they are known to be involved in the ecdysteroid pathway in insects and their tetranychid counterparts likely fulfill an analogous role  <cit> . similar to t. urticae, orthologs of insect cyp <dig> clan members cyp306a <dig> and cyp18a <dig> could also not be identified for both panonychus species . in insects, cyp306a1s are involved in the synthesis of  <dig> hydroxyecdysone  by hydroxylating carbon  <dig>  while cyp18a <dig> is a hydroxylase/oxidase involved in ecdysteroid degradation  <cit> . their absence in panonychus sp. further corroborates that this gene cluster was lost as a whole and is an ancient trait, leading to the use of ponasterone a as the moulting hormone instead of 20e.

in insects, the number of cyp <dig> genes is relatively well conserved and several insect cyp <dig> genes are known to be involved in essential physiological functions. compared to insects the number of cyp <dig> genes is more diverse in t. urticae and the cladoceran daphnia sp.  <cit>  and at present the  <dig> family within the cyp <dig> clan is best characterized in t. urticae. a whole genome microarray gene expression analysis revealed that several members of the cyp <dig> clan were upregulated in acaricide resistant t. urticae strains or in a t. urticae strain adapted to a new challenging host plant  <cit> . furthermore, functional expression of two t. urticae cyp <dig> clan enzymes, cyp392a <dig> and cyp392e <dig>  confirmed that these could metabolise the acaricides spirodiclofen and abamectin, respectively  <cit> . we identified  <dig> and  <dig> cyp <dig> orfs in p. ulmi and p. citri respectively. in our phylogenetic analysis, there are two clear cases of 1:1: <dig> orthology within the cyp <dig> clan . the phylogenetic analysis also suggests that the potential expansion/loss events of certain cyp <dig> subfamilies, like cyp392a, cyp392d and cyp392e, occurred after the split between the tetranychus and panonychus genus. consequently, it was not surprising that we could not identify a clear p. ulmi/p. citri ortholog of t. urticae cyp392e <dig> and cyp392a <dig>  suggesting that spirodiclofen or abamectin metabolism must depend on different p450s or other factors in panonychus species .

insect cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> clans comprise the insect specific families cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> that are well known for their involvement in environmental response/detoxification functions against xenobiotics and phytotoxins  <cit> . we identified  <dig> p. ulmi and  <dig> p. citri orfs in the cyp <dig> clan, while  <dig> p. ulmi and  <dig> p. citri orfs were found in the cyp <dig> clan. within the cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> clan we found  <dig>  and  <dig>  clear cases of 1:1: <dig> orthology between t. urticae, p. ulmi and p. citri, respectively. within the cyp <dig> clan, the cyp389a subfamily consists of a single gene in t. urticae while  <dig> paralogs are present in each, p. ulmi and p. citri. in contrast, the cyp389c subfamily appears to be larger in t. urticae compared to the two panonychus species. interestingly, ran et al.  <cit>  showed that p. citri paralogs of t. urticae cyp389a <dig> were among the most up- and down regulated cyp genes in an amitraz resistant strain. ding et al.  <cit> , on the other hand, showed that a p. citri ortholog of t. urticae cyp4cf <dig> was highly induced upon exposure to pyridaben while the expression of a p. citri ortholog of t. urticae cyp4cl <dig> increased after induction by abamectin, azocyclotin, pyridaben, and spirodiclofen. in contrast to the cyp <dig> clan, none of these tetranychid cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> clan members have been functionally characterized.

carboxylcholinesterases
carboxylcholinesterases  catalyse the hydrolysis of carboxylesters and have a whole gamut of physiological functions including degradation of neurotransmitters, metabolizing hormones and pheromones, regulation of behaviour and detoxification of xenobiotics  <cit> . cces are phase i detoxification enzymes and their role in xenobiotic metabolism and the development of resistance in arthropods has been thoroughly studied . a classification based on the cce phylogeny, as proposed by  <cit>  groups insect cces into  <dig> clades spread over  <dig> classes: the dietary/detoxification enzymes , the generally secreted enzymes  and the neuro/developmental cces   <cit> . while total numbers of cces in insects and t. urticae are similar, the neuro/developmental class is expanded in t. urticae with two new subclades j’ and j”. in addition, in contrast to insects no t. urticae cces have been identified within the currently recognized classification of insect dietary cces  <cit> .

we found a total of  <dig> and  <dig> cce non-allelic orfs in the p. ulmi and p. citri transcriptome, of which  <dig> and  <dig> orfs of p. ulmi and p. citri, respectively, were included into a phylogenetic analysis. based on this analysis or the best blastx hit with t. urticae cces, p. ulmi and p. citri cces could be assigned to one of the  <dig> cce clades . similar to t. urticae cces, the majority of panonychus cces belong to the neuro/developmental clade, with  <dig> p. ulmi and  <dig> p. citri cces in clade j” and  <dig> p. ulmi and  <dig> p. citri cces in clade j’ . in sixteen cases, 1:1: <dig> orthologous groups could be identified between t. urticae and panonychus species:  <dig> in clade j ,  <dig> in clade k ,  <dig> in clade l ,  <dig> in clade j’,  <dig> in clade f’ ,  <dig> in undetermined clades  and  <dig> in clade j”. remarkably, within the subclade j’, a putative expansion of cces in t. urticae  was found, suggesting these t. urticae j’ cces arose after the tetranychus/panonychus divergence within the tetranychidae. finally, in clade j’ two clear p. ulmi orthologues of p. citri pccce <dig> and pccce <dig> could be identified. the latter have their best blastn  hit with p. citri pce <dig> and pce <dig>  respectively, which have been shown to be induced by acaricide exposure  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of p. ulmi putative cces. a set of p. ulmi, p. citri, t. urticae, d. melanogaster, anopheles gambiae and apis mellifera cce protein sequences were aligned using muscle, subsequently trimmed according to  <cit>  and subjected to a maximum-likelihood analysis using treefinder  <cit> . the tree was midpoint rooted and numbers at the branch point of each node represent the bootstrap value resulting from  <dig> pseudoreplicates . the scale bar represents  <dig>  substitutions per site. tetranychid cces clustered into clades  <cit> : f’ , i, j , j, j”, k , l , m  and three undetermined clades . colour and shape codes are as follows: p. ulmi, green triangle, p. citri, yellow triangle, t. urticae, red square, d. melanogaster, black dot, anopheles gambiae, purple dot and apis mellifera, blue dot. an arrow and an asterisk indicate cces associated with high levels of spirodiclofen resistance in p. ulmi  and t. urticae  <cit> , respectively. cce protein sequences and accession numbers can be found in additional file 9

glutathione-s-transferases
glutathione-s-transferases  belong to a multifunctional enzyme family, known to play an important role in phase ii of xenobiotic detoxification. in addition to pesticide detoxification by conjugation, insect gsts have also been reported to play a role in attenuation of oxidative stress caused by pesticide exposure and sporadically by metabolism of pesticides directly  <cit> . insects cytosolic gsts can be divided into seven classes  with delta and epsilon gsts well known for their role in detoxification of organophosphates and organochlorines  <cit> . in contrast to insects, acari also have mu-class gsts, which were until recently thought to be verterbrate specific  <cit> .

we found a total of  <dig> p. ulmi and  <dig> p. citri gst non-allelic orfs of which  <dig> p. ulmi and  <dig> p. citri gsts were included in a phylogenetic analysis . based on this analysis or based on the best blastp hit with t. urticae gsts, p. ulmi and p. citri gsts could be assigned to  <dig> gst-classes: delta, mu, omega and zeta. the number of p. ulmi gsts is lower than those observed in p. citri, t. urticae and ixodes scapularis . although blastp searches against the non-redundant database performed by  <cit>  identified representatives of sigma and theta gst we were unable to find neither of those two classes in the transcriptome of p. ulmi. the lack of theta and sigma gsts seems to be a common feature of acari species analysed to date  <cit> . similar to the phylogenetic analysis of tetranychid cyp genes  only limited orthologous relationships between tetranychid gsts could be established, as illustrated by the presence of t. urticae specific clusters of delta and mu gsts. in both the omega and zeta class we identified a 1:1: <dig> orthology between panonychus contigs and t. urticae gsts . within the mu gsts we found two 1:1: <dig> orthologs  while no 1:1: <dig> orthologs could be identified in the delta gsts .table  <dig> comparison of the cytosolic gst gene number in t. urticae, p. ulmi, p. citri and i. scapularis

using a whole genome gene-expression microarray, members of the same gst classes were also shown to be highly upregulated in multi-resistant t. urticae strains  <cit> . three gst genes  that were upregulated in a strain mar-ab highly resistant against abamectin and other important acaricides were also functionally expressed. out of these, tugstd <dig> showed the highest affinity toward abamectin and had a competitive type of inhibition, suggesting the acaricide may bind to the h-site of the enzyme  <cit> . however, as mentioned earlier no clear panonychus orthologs of tugstd <dig> could be identified in our study.

abc transporters
the atp binding cassettte  protein family is a large and ubiquitous family of proteins. most members of this family use atp to transport substrates across lipid membranes, and hence are referred to as abc transporters. based on the sequence similarity of their nucleotide binding domain  the abc protein family can be divided into eight subfamilies . although extensively characterized for their involvement in drug resistance in vertebrates, the role of abc transporters in arthropod xenobiotic resistance is less well known. nevertheless, abc transporters have been associated with resistance to as many as  <dig> insecticides/acaricides from nine different chemical classes  <cit> . however, the major source of evidence linking these arthropod abc transporters to resistance has been abc transporter expression quantification or synergism studies  <cit> . a total of  <dig> abc genes were identified in the t. urticae genome, the highest number discovered in a metazoan species to date. this high number of abc genes in t. urticae is due predominantly to lineage-specific expansions of the abcc, abcg and abch subfamilies  <cit> .

we found  <dig> p. ulmi and  <dig> p. citri orfs with a tblastn hit with t. urticae abc protein sequences . nbds from the orfs of these contigs, when present, were extracted and used in a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis. similar to previous studies  <cit>  c-terminal nbds of abcc transporters clustered together with nbds of abcb transporters . based on this analysis or, in case the orf did not encode an nbd, based on its best blastx hit with t. urticae abc proteins, we assigned p. ulmi and p. citri abc orfs to one of the  <dig> abc gene subfamilies . as abc genes are large genes , they can be easily fragmented into multiple contigs assembled from rna-seq reads. this could result in an overestimation of the number of putative abc genes. therefore, we used the number of nbds to estimate quantitative differences among the abc gene families in the tetranychidae . the number of t. urticae nbds is much higher than the number of p. citri and p. ulmi nbds, and is mainly due to a higher number of t. urticae nbds in the abca, abcc, abcg and abch gene subfamily. in several cases t. urticae abch nbds do not have a counterpart in panonychus species while in both the abca, abcc as abcg gene family a putative expansion of t. urticae nbds compared to panonychus nbds can be suspected. interestingly, for exactly two of these t. urticae abc gene subfamilies it was shown that several genes were differentially expressed in multi-pesticide resistant strains and/or in mites transferred to challenging host plants  <cit> . finally, nbds of abc transporters that are considered as conserved in arthropods , abcc , abcd, abce, abcf, abcg ) were also found in both panonychus species   <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of p. ulmi abc protein nbds. maximum likelihood midpoint rooted tree of n- and/or c-terminal nbds extracted from p. ulmi and p. citri abc protein coding orfs and t. urticae and d. melanogaster abc protein sequences. the scale bar represents  <dig>  amino-acid substitutions per site. p. ulmi and p. citri nbds clustered within the eight currently described abc subfamilies . the tree was midpoint rooted and numbers at the branch point of each node represent the bootstrap value resulting from  <dig> pseudoreplicates . c-terminal nbds of abcc transporters clustered together with nbds of abcb transporters  <cit> . colour and shape codes are as follows: p. ulmi, green triangle, p. citri, yellow triangle, t. urticae, red square and d. melanogaster, black dot. abc protein sequences and accession numbers can be found in additional file 11

horizontal gene transfer  refers to the asexual transfer of genetic information between non-related species. in bacteria and fungi hgt is a strong evolutionary force contributing to adaptation and colonization of challenging environments. due to the unique characteristics of animal biology, the prevalence and impact of hgt on animal evolution was considered to be minor. however, recent studies have uncovered a vast array of horizontally transferred genes  in the t. urticae genome with plausible roles in xenobiotics detoxification or other responses to the environment. these include  <dig> udp-glycosyltransferases  <cit> ,  <dig> intradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenases  <cit> ,  <dig> carotenoid desaturases,  <dig> carotenoid cyclase/synthases  <cit> ,  <dig> levanases  <cit> , a cyanate lyase  <cit> , β-cyanoalanine synthase  <cit>  and a methionine synthase  <cit> . orthologs of these t. urticae htgs were identified in both panonychus transcriptomes . the presence of these genes in the panonychus genus strongly suggests that these horizontal gene transfers occurred before the split of the tetranychus and panonychus genus. as the majority of the microbial xenologues of these unique spider mite genes code for enzymes able to detoxify and break down plant secondary metabolites, it has been argued that hgt facilitated spider mite adaptations to a phytophagous lifestyle  <cit> . in the sections below we will discuss some of these tetranychid hgt families more into detail.table  <dig> comparison of the ugt gene number in t. urticae, p. ulmi, p. citri and i. scapularis

udp-glycosyltransferases
udp-glycosyltransferases  are common in the majority of living organisms including viruses, bacteria, plants and animals. they catalyze the conjugation of small lipophilic molecules with uridine diphosphate  sugars, increasing their water solubility. as such, ugts play an important role in the synthesis, storage and transport of secondary metabolites. in vertebrates, ugts are also well studied because of their role in phase ii drug metabolism  <cit> . although a role for ugts in arthropod xenobiotic resistance was suggested more than twenty years ago  <cit> , only recently has functional evidence for their role in xenobiotic resistance been presented . it has been suggested that the ugt gene family might have been lost early in the chelicerata lineage and subsequently re-gained in the tetranychid mites by means of the horizontal gene transfer from bacteria. this discovery provides important clues to ugts functions in relation to detoxification and therefore host adaptation in the phytophagous mites.

we identified a total of  <dig> and  <dig> p. ulmi and p. citri ugt non-allelic orfs, respectively. a subset of  <dig> p. ulmi and  <dig> p. citri orfs were included in a phylogenetic analysis . based on this analysis or based on the t. urticae best blastx hit, p. ulmi and p. citri ugts could be assigned to one of the ugt subfamilies . within tetranychidae the ugt <dig> subfamily is the largest ugt subfamily with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ugt orfs/genes in p. ulmi, p. citri and t. urticae, respectively . the ugt201a, ugt201b, ugt202a and ugt204a subfamily are clearly more numerous in t. urticae compared to both panonychus species while the opposite could be observed for the ugt201g subfamily, suggesting the ugts in these subfamilies probably arose in t. urticae or were lost in p. ulmi after diversification within the tetranychidae. finally, within different ugt subfamilies clear 1:1: <dig> orthologous relationships could be observed between panonychus ugts and t. urticae ugt202b <dig>  ugt203g <dig>  ugt203f <dig>  ugt204c <dig>  ugt205a <dig>  ugt206a <dig> and ugt207a <dig> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of p. ulmi putative ugts. maximum likelihood midpoint rooted tree of p. ulmi, p. citri and t. urticae ugt protein sequences. the scale bar represents  <dig>  amino-acid substitutions per site. numbers at the branch point of each node represent the bootstrap value resulting from  <dig> pseudoreplicates . color and shape codes are as follows: p. ulmi, green triangle, p. citri, yellow triangle and t. urticae, red square. ugt protein sequences can be found in additional file 12




intradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenases 
among metazoa, tetranychid mites are the only species known to harbor genes encoding idrcds. in bacteria and fungi these enzymes catalyze the oxygenolytic fission of catecholic substances, allowing them to degrade aromatic rings, an essential step in the carbon cycle  <cit> . however, their role in tetranychid mites has not yet been characterized. about half of the number of genes in this family were differentially expressed in mites upon host plant change and in multi-resistant t. urticae strains, and their expression patterns were highly correlated, suggestive of a role for this gene family in xenobiotic resistance  <cit> . twelve p. ulmi and  <dig> p. citri contigs showed a tblastn hit with t. urticae idrcd proteins. a phylogenetic analysis revealed several orthologous relationships between tetranychid idrcds , suggesting these idrcd genes arose before the split between the tetranychus and panonychus genus . furthermore, an expansion of idrcds can be observed in both t. urticae  as in p. ulmi and p. citri . remarkably, exactly those idrcds that are absent in both panonychus species are highly upregulated in mites upon host plant change and in multi-resistant t. urticae strains  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of p. ulmi putative idrcds. maximum likelihood midpoint rooted tree of p. ulmi, p. citri, t. urticae and t. evansi idrcd protein sequences. the scale bar represents  <dig>  amino-acid substitutions per site. numbers at the branch point of each node represent the bootstrap value resulting from  <dig> pseudoreplicates . panonychus sp. and tetranychus sp. specific clades are shaded in blue and green, respectively. idrcd protein sequences and accession numbers can be found in additional file 12




other horizontal gene transfers
besides ugts and idrcds we also identified panonychus orthologs of t. urticae carotenoid desaturases, carotenoid cyclases, levanases, cyanate lyase, β-cyanoalanine synthase and methionine synthase . wybouw et al.  <cit>  showed that a t. urticae strain overexpresses β-cyanoalanine synthase when adapted to cyanogenic plants. functional expression also revealed that this enzyme is able to detoxify cyanide which is the main defensive phytochemical of these plants. in contrast to t. urticae, panonychus sp. almost exclusively feed on rosaceae  <cit> , a cyanogenic plant family producing cyanide in various tissues as plant defense  <cit> . as such, β-cyanoalanine synthase might have been crucial in conferring resistance in panonychus sp. to this continuous exposure to dietary cyanide.

target-sites of insecticides/acaricides
since the psr-tk strain originates from the field and has evolved resistance to at least hexythiazox, clofentezine and spirodiclofen  <cit> , the p. ulmi transcriptome was mined for contigs encoding known target sites of acaricides, in order to search for snps associated with target-site resistance. we successfully annotated acetylcholinesterase , voltage gated sodium channel , gaba- and glutamate-gated chloride channels , chitin synthase  <dig> , acetyl-coa carboxylase  and cytochrome b    mode of action classes that target these proteins  <cit> ). to obtain p. ulmi target-site sequences as full-length as possible, we also mined an alternative p. ulmi assembly, which was constructed using the velvet/oases package , and combined contigs from the latter assembly with the one described in this study .table  <dig> known target sites of acaricides, their t. urticae gene id and presence in p. ulmi and the irac acaricide classes that target these proteins

compared to insects t. urticae has a higher number of rdl and glucl genes, with the majority of insects having only one rdl and glucl gene while t. urticae has  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . similar to t. urticae we identified  <dig> p. ulmi glucl and  <dig> rdl genes , suggesting that the rdl and glucl gene family diversified before the radiation of the tetranychidae. next, we compared all known target-site sequences of the spirodiclofen susceptible  and resistant  p. ulmi strains to identify non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms  that are unique for the resistant strain. for ache, we identified the f331w substitution  that was fixed in the psr-tk strain but segregating in the hs strain. in the past, it has been shown that a substitution at this position causes resistance to organophosphate  and carbamate  insecticides/acaricides  <cit>  and the presence of this substitution in both p. ulmi strains emphasizes the scope of selection exerted by ops and cbs during the second half of the 20th century.

comparing accase sequences of both strains revealed several non-synonymous fixed snps in the psr-tk strain that were not present in the susceptible hs-strain. at present, only one accase substitution has been associated with resistance against cyclic keto-enols: an e645k substitution in the whitefly trialeurodes vaporariorum  <cit> . however, the residue is not conserved in mites and at the corresponding position in the p. ulmi accase protein, the sequence is identical in both strains . recently, it has been shown that the activated enol derivative of the insecticide spirotetramate interacts with the carboxyltransferase domain of accase  <cit> , suggesting this region as a prime site to expect resistance mutations. within this domain region, we also found several residues that were different between the accase protein sequence of the psr-tk and the hs-strain . however, it is unclear whether these substitutions play a role in resistance. similarly to accase, other target site sequences  contained non-synonymous snps in the psr-tk strain that were not present in the hs strain, but none were located at positions previously reported to be involved in acaricide resistance  <cit> .

differential expression analysis between an acaricide resistant  and susceptible strain  of p. ulmi using rnaseq data
rna was extracted from  <dig> 1– <dig> day old adult female p. ulmi mites from the psr-tk and hs strains with four-fold biological replication . using the replicated rnaseq data and the deseq <dig> software, we performed a differential expression analysis between the acaricide resistant  and a susceptible  strain of p. ulmi. only those contigs that  were not considered as contamination by the ncbi contamination screen  have strand-specific reads and  have a blastx hit were included in our differential expression analysis . for all p. ulmi contigs the number of mapped reads per contig can be found in additional file  <dig>  for further analyses described below, we excluded p. ulmi contigs without a blastx hit as a biological role of the proteins coded by these contigs cannot be assigned. we observed that  <dig> of  <dig> p. ulmi contigs were significantly upregulated  in the psr-tk strain compared to the hs strain, while  <dig> were significantly downregulated . for a subset of contigs , the differential expression analysis based on rnaseq was validated by qpcr on cdnas of the same populations .fig.  <dig> volcano plot of differentially expressed contigs in the acaricide resistant psr-tk strain relative to the susceptible hs strain. the negative log <dig> of benjamini-hochberg  adjusted p-values was plotted against the log2fc in gene expression. p. ulmi contigs up- and downregulated, by twofold or more  are depicted as light grey circular dots. circular dots of various colours depict contigs with a best blastx hit with t. urticae proteins putatively involved in xenobiotic detoxification . contigs encoding detoxification genes putatively involved in spirodiclofen resistance are indicated in the plot by id pup450_ <dig>  =  <dig> , bh adjusted p-value =  <dig> e−193) and id pucce_ <dig>  =  <dig> , bh adjusted p-value = <dig> e−257)

several up- and downregulated contigs showed high homology with sequences of arthropod bisegmented double stranded rna viruses  . there are several reports documenting viruses infecting panonychus species . as such, differential expression of birna viruses between the two resistant strains might reflect the different virus composition and infection status.

among the differentially expressed contigs,  <dig> coded for major detoxification enzyme families or potential new players in detoxification . among the upregulated contigs, we identified  <dig> cces,  <dig> cyps,  <dig> gsts,  <dig> abcs,  <dig> ugts,  <dig> lipocalins and  <dig> major facilitator superfamily genes while  <dig> cyp,  <dig> cces,  <dig> gst,  <dig> abcs and  <dig> idrcds were downregulated . such a broad response in detoxifying enzyme families is typically also encountered in the spider mite t. urticae, where numerous gene-expression studies of susceptible and resistant strains have shown an overlap in the gene-families involved  <cit> , but also specificity in term of the members of these families.

two differentially expressed contigs also coded for the same small  fragment of the gene coding for accase, the target-site of cyclic keto-enols  <cit>  , but with a six nucleotide difference between the two contig sequences. one of these contigs was highly upregulated  in the psr-tk strain according to our analysis while the other was highly downregulated . a close inspection of mapped reads revealed that sequences polymorphism could explain this result . therefore, we mapped all reads from both p. ulmi strains against the manually assembled p. ulmi accase gene  and found no significant difference in expression . two contigs encoding cces  and a cyp  were among the most highly upregulated contigs while another cce contig  was one of the most downregulated . rt-qpcr data confirmed the upregulation of contig_00577/pucce <dig> and contig_01016/pucyp <dig> and the downregulation of contig_00445/pucce <dig>  while upregulation of contig_19626/pucce <dig> was only partially confirmed . qpcr expression analysis also confirmed that the up- and downregulation of contig_00577/pucce <dig> and contig_00445/pucce <dig> in psr-tk might be the result of spirodiclofen selection, with both contigs being slightly downregulated in ge 16/ <dig>  and highly up- and downregulated in psr-tk relative to hs, respectively . in addition, the same pattern was found for a cyp  which is highly upregulated in psr-tk-while and slightly downregulated in ge 16/ <dig> compared to the hs strain .fig.  <dig> effect of spirodiclofen selection on expression of genes putatively involved in spirodiclofen resistance. qpcr quantification of expression levels of contig_ <dig> , contig_ <dig>  and contig_ <dig> in p. ulmi strains hs , psr-tk  and ge 16/ <dig>  the parental strain of psr-tk   <cit> . the data from qpcr were presented as mean of three replicates. error bars represent the standard error of the calculated mean. asterisks indicate significant different expression values compared to the reference condition 



previously, it was shown that the p <dig> inhibitor pbo and the esterase inhibitor def could enhance the toxicity of spirodiclofen in a highly spirodiclofen resistant t. urticae strain  <cit>  and in a spirodiclofen resistant p. citri strain  <cit> . similarly, kramer and nauen  <cit>  showed that pbo enhanced the toxicity of spirodiclofen in psr-tk p. ulmi strain, suggesting the involvement of cyps in spirodiclofen resistance in both tetranychid species. the upregulation of a cyp  and a cce  was also strongly associated with spirodiclofen resistance in two unrelated t. urticae strains . furthermore, functional expression confirmed that cyp392e <dig> metabolizes spirodiclofen  <cit> . remarkably, the upregulated p. ulmi cce and cyp in the psr-tk strain cluster in different clades in our phylogenetic analyses of tetranychid cces and cyps than those that are upregulated in the spirodiclofen-resistant t. urticae strains . thus, within the tetranychidae, two different species are able to develop a similar resistance mechanism to spirodiclofen, but the enzymes recruited for this purpose do not need to have followed the same evolutionary path. this independent development of resistance in related species is further reinforced by the fact that only few of the differentially expressed contigs in the psr-tk p. ulmi strain have a blastx hit with amino acid translations of differentially expressed genes in two spirodiclofen resistant t. urticae strains  . overall, the analysis has pointed to a number of genes and enzymes that might be causal for the resistant phenotype, and future work including functional expression should confirm that the enzymes can metabolize or sequester spirodiclofen leading to resistance, as was recently undertaken for the model species t. urticae  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
using paired-end strand specific reads from rna of spirodiclofen susceptible and resistant p. ulmi strains we generated a p. ulmi transcriptome dataset containing  <dig>  contigs. as such, our transcriptome data represents a significant increase in the genomic resources that are available for this species. phylogenetic analyses revealed that in the majority of cases detoxification gene  classes/clades/subfamilies are more numerate in t. urticae compared to p. ulmi, suggestive of a link between detoxification gene proliferation and the polyphagous nature of t. urticae. specific radiations of subfamilies in p. ulmi were also observed. annotation of all major target-sites in p. ulmi revealed the presence of mutations in ache that are likely to confer carbamate and organophosphate resistance. finally, we used the replicated rnaseq data to assess differences in gene expression between a spirodiclofen resistant and susceptible p. ulmi strain and found that a cyp and cces are likely to be associated with spirodiclofen resistance in p. ulmi. these results are in line with a previous report on molecular mechanisms of spirodiclofen resistance in t. urticae. however, the upregulated cyp and cce in the resistant strains from both species seem not to have evolved from the same common ancestor, indicating both species developed spirodiclofen resistance in a similar but nevertheless independent evolutionary manner. to conclude, the new genomic resources and data that we present in this study for p. ulmi will substantially facilitate molecular studies of underlying mechanisms involved in acaricide resistance.
