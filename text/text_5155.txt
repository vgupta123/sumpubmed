BACKGROUND
the nematode anguillicola crassus kuwahara, niimi et itagaki,  <dig> is a native parasite of the japanese eel anguilla japonica <cit> . adults localise to the swim bladder where they feed on blood  <cit> . larvae are transmitted via crustacean intermediate hosts  <cit> . originally endemic to east asian populations of an. japonica, a. crassus has attracted interest due to recent anthropogenic expansion of its geographic and host ranges to europe and the european eel, anguilla anguilla. a. crassus was recorded for the first time in europe in north-west germany in  <dig>  <cit> , where it was most likely introduced through the live-eel trade  <cit> . a. crassus has subsequently spread rapidly through populations of its newly acquired host  <cit> , and has been found in all an. anguilla populations except those in iceland  <cit> . a. crassus can thus be regarded as a model for the introduction and spread of invasive parasites  <cit> .

in an. anguilla, both prevalence and mean intensity of infection by a. crassus are higher than in an. japonica <cit> . in an. anguilla infections, the adult nematodes are larger, have an earlier onset of reproduction, a greater egg output  <cit>  and induce increased pathology, including thickening and inflammation of the swim bladder wall  <cit> . it has been suggested that the life history modifications and changed virulence observed in a. crassus in the new host are due to an inadequate immune response in an. anguilla <cit> . an. japonica is capable of killing histotropic larvae of the parasite after vaccination  <cit>  or under high infection pressure  <cit> , but this does not happen in a. anguilla.

the genus anguillicola is placed in the nematode suborder spirurina   <cit> . the spirurina are exclusively parasitic and include important human pathogens  as well as prominent veterinary parasites. molecular phylogenetic analyses place anguillicola in a clade of spirurine nematodes  that have a freshwater or marine intermediate host, but infect a wide range of carnivorous definitive hosts. spirurina b is sister to the main spirurina c, including the agents of filariasis and ascariasis, and thus a. crassus may be used as an outgroup taxon to understand the evolution of parasitic phenotypes in these species.

the differences in the biology of a. crassus in an. japonica  and an. anguilla  eel hosts is likely to result from differential interactions between host genetics and parasite genetics. while genetic differences between the host species are expected, it is not known what part, if any, genetic differentiation between the invading european and endemic asian parasites plays. european a. crassus are less genetically variable than parasites taken from asian hosts  <cit> , reflecting the derived nature of the invading populations and the likely population bottlenecks this entailed. as part of a programme to understand the invasiveness of a. crassus in an. anguilla, we are investigating differences in gene expression and genetic distinction between invading european and endemic asian a. crassus exposed to the two host species.

recent advances in sequencing technology  provide the opportunity for rapid and cost-effective generation of genome-scale data. the roche  <dig> platform  <cit>  is particularly suited to transcriptomics of previously unstudied species  <cit> . here we describe the generation of a reference transcriptome for a. crassus based on roche  <dig> data, and explore patterns of gene expression and diversity within the nematode.

methods
nematode samples, rna extraction, cdna synthesis and sequencing
a. crassus from an. japonica were sampled from kao-ping river and an adjacent aquaculture in taiwan as described in  <cit> . nematodes from an. anguilla were sampled from sniardwy lake, poland and from the linkenheimer altrhein, germany. after determination of the sex of adult nematodes, they were stored in rna-later  until extraction of rna. rna was extracted from individual adult male and female nematodes and from a population of second stage larvae  . for host contamination screening a liver sample from an uninfected an. japonica was also processed. rna was reverse transcribed and amplified into cdna using the mint-cdna synthesis kit . emulsion pcr and library preparation were performed for each cdna library according to the manufacturer’s protocols , and sequenced on a roche  <dig> genome sequencer flx.

raw sequencing reads are archived under study-accession number srp <dig> in the ncbi sequence read archive   <cit> . all samples were sequenced using the flx titanium chemistry, except for the taiwanese female sample t <dig>  which was sequenced using flx standard chemistry, to generate between  <dig>  and  <dig>  raw reads per sample. for the l <dig> library, which had a larger number of non-a. crassus, non-anguilla reads, we confirmed that these data were not laboratory contaminants by screening roche  <dig> data produced on the same run in independent sequencing lanes.

trimming, quality control and assembly
raw sequences were extracted in fasta format  using sffinfo  and screened for mint adapter sequences using cross-match  <cit>  . seqclean  <cit>  was used to identify and remove poly-a-tails, low quality, low complexity and short  sequences. all reads were compared to a set of screening databases using blast  <cit>  . the databases used were  a host sequence database comprising an assembly of the an. japonica roche  <dig> data, a unpublished assembly of an. anguilla sanger dideoxy sequenced expressed sequence tags  and transcripts from eeelbase  <cit> , a publicly available transcriptome database for the european eel;  a database of ribosomal rna  sequences from eel species derived from our roche  <dig> data and embl-bank; and  a database of rrna sequences identified in our a. crassus data by comparing the reads to known nematode rrnas from embl-bank. this last database notably also contained cobiont rrna sequences. reads with matches to one of these databases over more than 80% of their length and with greater than 95% identity were removed from the dataset. screening and trimming information was written back into sff-format using sfffile . the filtered and trimmed data were assembled using the combined assembly approach  <cit> : two assemblies were generated, one using newbler v <dig>   <cit>  , the other using mira v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  . the resulting two assemblies were combined into one using cap <dig>  <cit>  at default settings and contigs were labeled by whether they derived from both assemblies , or one assembly only . the superset of highca contigs, lowca contigs and the remaining unassembled reads defines the set of tentatively unique genes .

post-assembly classification and taxonomic assignment of contigs
we rescreened the assembly for host and other contamination by comparing it  to the three databases defined above, and also to nembase <dig>  a nematode transcriptome database derived from whole genome sequencing and est assemblies  <cit> . for each contig, the highest-scoring match was recorded, if it spanned more than 50% of the contig. we also compared the contigs to the ncbi non-redundant nucleotide  and protein  databases, recording the taxonomy of all best matches with expect values better than 1e- <dig>  sequences with a best hit to non-metazoans or to chordata within metazoa were excluded from further analysis.

protein prediction and annotation
protein translations were predicted from the contigs using prot4est   <cit> . proteins were predicted either by joining single high scoring segment pairs  from a blast search of uniref <dig>  <cit> , or by estscan  <cit> , using as training data the brugia malayi complete proteome  <cit>  back-translated using a codon usage table derived from the blast hsps, or, if the first two methods failed, simply the longest orf in the contig. for contigs where the protein prediction required insertion or deletion of bases in the original sequence, we also imputed an edited sequence for each affected contig. annotations with gene ontology , enzyme commission  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  terms were inferred for these proteins using annot8r   <cit> , using the annotated sequences available in uniref <dig>  <cit> . up to  <dig> annotations based on a blast similarity bitscore cut-off of  <dig> were obtained for each annotation set. the complete b. malayi proteome  and the complete c. elegans proteome  were also annotated in the same way. signalp v <dig>   <cit>  was used to predict signal peptide cleavage sites and signal anchor signatures for the a. crassus transcriptome and for the proteomes of the two model nematodes. interproscan  <cit>   was used to obtain domain annotations for the highca contigs. we recorded the presence of a lethal rnai phenotype in the c. elegans ortholog of each tug using the biomart-interface  <cit>  to wormbase v.  <dig> using the r package biomart  <cit> .

single nucleotide polymorphism analysis
we mapped the raw reads to the complete set of contigs, replacing imputed sequences for originals where relevant, using ssaha <dig>   <cit> . from the ssaha <dig> output, pileup files were produced using samtools  <cit> , discarding reads mapping to multiple regions. varscan  <cit>   was used with default parameters on pileup files to output lists of single nucleotide polymorphisms  and their locations.

in the  <dig>  snps thus defined, the ratio of transitions  to transversion  was  <dig> . from the prot4est predictions,  <dig>  of the snps were predicted to be inside an orf, with  <dig>  at codon first positions,  <dig>  at second positions and  <dig>  at third positions. as expected, ti/tv inside orfs  was higher than outside orfs . the ratio of synonymous polymorphisms per synonymous site to non-synonymous polymorphisms per non-synonymous site in this unfiltered snp set  was  <dig> , rather high compared to other analyses. roche  <dig> sequences have well-known systematic errors associated with homopolymeric nucleotide sequences  <cit> , and the effect of exclusion of snps in, or close to, homopolymer regions was explored. when snps were discarded using different size thresholds for homopolymer runs and proximity thresholds, the ti/tv and in dn/ds ratios changed . based on this snps associated with a homopolymer run longer than  <dig> bases within a window of  <dig> bases  around the snp were discarded. there was a relationship between tug dn/ds and tug coverage, associated with the presence of sites with low abundance minority alleles , suggesting that some of these may be errors. removing low abundance minority allele snps from the set removed this effect . for enrichment analysis of go terms associated with positively selected tugs we used the r package gostats  <cit> .

using samtools  <cit>   and vcftools  <cit>   we genotyped individual libraries for each of the master list of snps. genotype- calls were accepted at a phred-scaled genotype quality threshold of  <dig>  in addition to the relative heterozygosity  we used the r package rhh  <cit>  to calculate internal relatedness  <cit> , homozygosity by locus  <cit>  and standardised heterozygosity  <cit>  from these data. we confirmed the significance of heterozygote-heterozygote correlation by analysing the mean and 95% confidence intervals from  <dig> bootstrap replicates estimated for all measurements.

gene expression analysis
read-counts were obtained from the bam files generated for genotyping using the r package rsamtoools  <cit> . lowca contigs and contigs with fewer than  <dig> reads over all libraries were excluded from analysis. libraries e <dig> and l <dig> had very low overall counts and thus we excluded these libraries from analysis. the statistic of audic and claverie  <cit>  as implemented in ideg <dig>  <cit>  was used to contrast single libraries. differential expression between libraries from male versus female nematodes was accepted for genes that differed in expression values between all the female libraries  versus the male  library , but had no differential expression within any of the female libraries at the same threshold. differential expression between libraries from nematodes of european an. anguilla and taiwanese an. japonica origin was accepted for genes that differed in expression values between library e <dig> and both libraries t <dig> and t <dig> , but showed no differences between t <dig> and t <dig> 

overrepresentation analyses
the r package annotationdbi  <cit>  was used to obtain a full list of associations  from annot8r annotations prior to analysis of go term overrepresentation in gene sets selected on the basis of dn/ds or expression values. the r package topgo  <cit>  was used to traverse the annotation graph and analyse each node term for overrepresentation in the focal gene set compared to an appropriate universal gene set  with the “classic” method and fisher’s exact test. terms for which an offspring term was already in the table and no additional counts supported overrepresentation were removed. mann-whitney u-tests were used to test the influence of factors on dn/ds values. to investigate multiple contrasts between groups  nemenyi-damico-wolfe-dunn tests were used, and for overrepresentation of one group  in other groups  fisher’s exact test was used.

general coding methods
the bulk of analysis  presented was carried out in r  <cit>  using custom scripts. for visualisation we used the r packages ggplot <dig>  <cit>  and venndiagram  <cit> .

RESULTS
sampling a. crassus
one female a. crassus and one male a. crassus were sampled from an an. japonica aquaculture with high infection loads in taiwan, and an additional female was sampled from an an. japonica caught in a stream with low infection pressure adjacent to the aquaculture. a female nematode and pool of l <dig> were sampled from an. anguilla in the river rhine, and one female from a. anguilla from a lake in poland. all adult nematodes were replete with host blood. to assist in downstream filtering of host from nematode reads, we also sampled rna from the liver of an uninfected taiwanese an. japonica.

assembly and post-assembly screening
a total of  <dig>  raw sequencing reads were generated for a. crassus . these were rigorously filtered  and  <dig>  remaining reads  were assembled using the combined assembler strategy  <cit> , employing roche  <dig> gsassembler  and mira   <cit>  . this coassembly will be included in future versions of nembase  and is available at http://www.anguillicola.nematod.es . it comprised  <dig>  contigs supported by both assembly algorithms,  <dig>  contigs supported by only one of the assembly algorithms and  <dig>  singletons that not assembled by either program . contigs supported by both assemblers were longer than those supported by only one assembler, and were more likely to have a significant similarity to previously sequenced protein coding genes than contigs assembled by only one of the algorithms, or the remaining unassembled singletons. these constitute the highca, while those with evidence from only one assembler and the singletons are the lowca. these datasets were the most parsimonious  for their quality . in the highca parsimony and low redundancy was prioritised, while in the complete assembly  completeness was prioritised. the  <dig>  sequences  in the complete assembly are referred to as tentatively unique genes .

we screened the complete assembly for remaining host contamination, and identified  <dig>  tugs that had significant, higher similarity to eel  than to nematode sequences  <cit> . given the identification of cercozoan ribosomal rnas in the l <dig> library, we also screened the complete assembly for contamination with transcripts from other taxa.

 <dig>  tugs were found with highest significant similarity to eukaryota outside of the kingdoms metazoa, fungi and viridiplantae. these contigs matched genes from a wide range of protists from apicomplexa , bacillariophyta , phaeophyceae , stramenopiles , kinetoplasitda  and heterolobosea . additionally  <dig> tugs had best, significant matches to genes from fungi  and  <dig> tugs had best, significant matches to genes from plants. outside the eukaryota there were significant best matches to bacteria , archaea  and viruses . no tugs had significant, best matches to wolbachia or related bacteria known as symbionts of nematodes and arthropods. all tugs with highest similarity to sequences deriving from taxa outside metazoa were excluded. the final, screened a. crassus assembly has  <dig>  tugs, spanning  <dig> , <dig> bases . all analyses reported below are based on this filtered dataset.

annotation
for  <dig>  of the a. crassus tugs a protein was predicted using prot4est  <cit>  . an apparently full-length open reading frame  was identified in  <dig> tugs, while for  <dig>  the 5’ ends and for  <dig>  the 3’ ends were missing. in  <dig>  tugs the corrected sequence with the imputed orf was slightly changed compared to the raw sequence by insertions or deletions necessary to obtain a continuous reading frame. using blast we determined that  <dig>  had significant similarity to c. elegans proteins,  <dig>  tugs matched b. malayi proteins, and  <dig>  tugs had matches in nempep <dig>  <cit> . comparison to the uniprot reference identified  <dig>  tugs with significant similarities. we used annot8r  <cit>  to assign go terms to  <dig>  tugs, ec numbers for  <dig>  tugs and kegg pathway annotations for  <dig>  tugs . additionally  <dig>  highca contigs were annotated with go terms through interproscan  <cit> . nearly one third  of the a. crassus tugs were annotated with at least one identifier, and  <dig>  had go, ec and kegg annotations .

we compared our a. crassus go annotations for high-level go-slim terms to the annotations  for the complete proteome of the spirurid filarial nematode b. malayi and the complete proteome of c. elegans . the occurrence of go terms in the annotation of the partial transcriptome of a. crassus was more similar to that of the proteome of b. malayi  than to the that of the proteome of c. elegans .

despite the lack of completeness at the 5’ end suggested by peptide prediction, just over 3% of the tugs were predicted to be secreted . again these predictions are more similar to predictions using the same methods for the proteome of b. malayi  than for the proteome of c. elegans .

by comparison to rnai phenotypes for c. elegans genes  <cit>  likely to be orthologous to a. crassus tugs,  <dig>  tugs were inferred to be essential .

to explore the phylogenetic conservation of a. crassus tugs, they were classified as conserved across kingdoms, conserved in metazoa, conserved in nematoda, conserved in spirurina or novel to a. crassus by comparing them to custom database subsets using blast . using a relatively strict cutoff, a quarter of the highca contigs were conserved across kingdoms, and 10% were apparently restricted to nematoda. nearly half of the highca contigs were novel to a. crassus.

similar patterns were observed for conservation assessed at different stringency, and when assessed across all tugs, except that a higher proportion of all tugs were apparently unique to a. crassus.

proteins predicted to be restricted to nematoda and novel in a. crassus were significantly enriched in signal peptide annotation compared to conserved proteins, proteins novel in metazoa and novel in spirurina . the proportion of lethal rnai phenotypes was significantly higher for c. elegans presumed orthologs of tugs conserved across kingdoms  than for orthologs of tugs not conserved across kingdoms .

identification and analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms
single nucleotide polymorphisms  were called using varscan  <cit>  on the  <dig> , <dig> bases of tugs that had coverage of more than 8-fold available. snps predicted to have more than  <dig> alleles, or that mapped to an undetermined  base were excluded, as were snp likely to be due to base calling errors close to homopolymer tracts and snp calls resulting from apparent rare variants.

our filtered snp dataset includes  <dig>  snps, with  <dig>  snps per kb of contig sequence . there were  <dig>  synonymous snps per  <dig> synonymous bases and  <dig>  non-synonymous snps per  <dig> non synonymous bases. a mean dn/ds of  <dig>  was calculated for the  <dig> tugs  containing at least one synonymous snp. positive selection can be inferred from high dn/ds ratios. overrepresented go ontology terms associated with tugs with dn/ds higher than  <dig>  were identified . within the molecular function category, “peptidase activity” was the most significantly overrepresented term. twelve of the thirteen high dn/ds tugs annotated as peptidases each had unique orthologs in c. elegans and b. malayi. other overrepresented categories identified subunits of the respiratory chain: “heme-copper terminal oxidase activity” and “cytochrome-c oxidase activity” in molecular function and “mitochondrion” in cellular compartment. contigs identified as novel to spirurina and novel in a. crassus had a significantly higher dn/ds than other contigs .

signal peptide containing proteins have been shown to have higher rates of evolution than cytosolic proteins in a number of nematode species. a. crassus tugs predicted to contain signal peptide cleavage sites showed a non-significant trend towards higher dn/ds values than tugs without signal peptide cleavage sites . orthologs of c. elegans transcripts with lethal rnai phenotype are expected to evolve under stronger selective constraints and the values of dn/ds showed a non-significant trend towards lower values in tugs with orthologs with a lethal phenotype compared to a non-lethal phenotypes .

the genotypes of single adult nematodes were called using samtools  <cit>  and vcftools  <cit> , and  <dig> informative sites  were identified in  <dig> contigs. internal relatedness  <cit> , homozygosity by loci  <cit>  and standardised heterozygosity  <cit>  all identified the taiwanese nematode from aquaculture  as the most heterozygous and the european nematode from poland  as the least heterozygous individuals .

the genome-wide representativeness of these  <dig> snp markers for the whole genome in population genetic studies was confirmed using heterozygosity-heterozygosity correlation  <cit> : mean internal relatedness =  <dig> , lower bound of 95% confidence intervals from  <dig> bootstrap replicates  =  <dig> ; mean homozygosity by loci =  <dig> , cil =  <dig> ; standardised heterozygosity =  <dig> , cil=  <dig> .

differential gene expression
gene expression was inferred by the unique mapping of  <dig>   of the raw reads to the fullest assembly . non-a. crassus contigs, and all contigs with fewer than  <dig> reads overall were excluded. thus  <dig> tugs were analysed for differential expression using ideg <dig> for normalisation and the statistic of audic and claverie  <cit>  for detection of differences. of these tugs,  <dig> showed expression predominantly in the male library,  <dig> tugs were more highly represented in the female library ,  <dig> tugs were primarily expressed in the libraries from taiwan, and  <dig> tugs were overrepresented in the european library .

analysis of overrepresentation of of go terms associated with tugs differentially expressed between male and female libraries identified ribosomal proteins, oxidoreductases and collagen processing enzyme terms . the ribosomal proteins were all overexpressed in the male library, while the oxidoreductases and collagen processing enzymes were overexpressed in female libraries. similar analysis of overrepresentation of of go terms associated with the tugs differentially expressed between european nematodes and asian nematodes identified several terms of catalytic activity related to metabolism .

tugs annotated as acyltransferase were upregulated in the european libraries. however, the expression patterns for other tugs with overrepresented terms connected to metabolism did not show concerted up or down-regulation. thus for the term “steroid biosynthetic process”,  <dig> tugs were downregulated and  <dig> contigs upregulated in european nematodes. no enrichment of signal peptide positive tugs, of tug conservation categories, or tugs with c. elegans orthologs with lethal or non-lethal rnai-phenotypes was identified. significantly elevated dn/ds was found for tugs differentially expressed in european versus asian nematodes . tugs overexpressed in the female libraries showed elevated levels of dn/ds , but contrast male overexpressed genes showed decreased levels of dn/ds .

discussion
we have generated a de novo transcriptome for a. crassus, an important invasive parasite that threatens wild stocks of the european eel an. anguilla. these data will enable a broad spectrum of molecular research on this ecologically important and evolutionarily interesting parasite.

as a. crassus lives in close association with its host, we used exhaustive filtering to remove all host-derived, and host-associated organism-derived contamination from the raw and assembled data. we generated a transcriptome dataset from the definitive host an. japonica as part of this filtering process. in addition to eel-derived transcripts, we also removed data apparently derived from protists, particularly cercozoans, that may have been co-parasites of the eels sampled. similar taxonomic screening of transcrioptome data has been shown to be important previously  <cit> , particularly in rejection of hypotheses of horizontal gene transfer into the focal species  <cit> . we were not able to use base frequency and codon usage based screening to identify contaminant data  <cit>  because contaminant sequences in our data derived from multiple genomes.

we used a combined assembly approach  <cit>  to generate a transcriptome estimate that had low redundancy and high completeness. projects using single assemblers often report substantially greater numbers of contigs for datasets of similar size . the 3’ bias in the assembly likely derivesd from the use of oligod in mrna capture and cdna synthesis and is near-ubiquitous in deep transcriptome sequencing projects . the final a. crassus tug assembly  spans  <dig>  mb, and thus likely covers most of the expected span of the transcriptome , albeit fragmented.

comparison between free-living and parasitic nematode species can be used to identify genes that may underpin adaptations for parastism  <cit> . annotations were derived for a 30% of all tugs, and over 50% of the highca contigs using sequence similarity to known proteins. domain annotations were derived for 45% of the highca tugs using interproscan  <cit> . comparison with the complete proteomes of b. malayi and c. elegans showed a remarkable degree of congruence in annotation spectrum in the two parasitic nematodes. this implies that the a. crassus transcriptome is a representative partial genome  <cit> . using a taxonomically-stratified analysis of blast similarities, we identified more a. crassus tugs that apparently arose in the common ancestor of nematoda than arose in the last common ancestor of the spirurina. as a. crassus is part of a lineage that arises basally in spirurina, the lack of genes associated with sprirurina may be due to phylogenetic distance obscuring relationships, particularly if the genes underpinning parasitism are, as would be expected, rapidly evolving. tugs predicted to be part of gene families that arose in the last common ancestor of nematoda or to be novel to a. crassus contained the highest proportion of genes predicted to have secretory signal peptides. this confirms observations made in a nippostrongylus brasiliensis <cit> , where secreted and surface proteins were less conserved. analysis of dn/ds  across conservation categories favors the hypothesis of rapid evolution in proteins with more restricted phylogenetic origins.

transcriptome data were generated from multiple individual a. crassus of taiwanese and european origin. we identified abundant snps both within and between populations, but noted aberrant patterns in the ratio of transitions to transversions  and the ratio of non-synonymous snps per non-synonymous site to synonymous snps per synonymous site . screening of snps in or adjacent to homopolymer regions, removing “noise” associated with common homopolymer errors  <cit> , improved overall measurements of snp quality, increased the ti/tv ratio to more closely resemble that of canonical datasets, and resulted in a reduced, credible dn/ds ratio distribution. the corrected ti/tv value of  <dig>   is in good agreement with the overall ti/tv of homo sapiens  or drosophila melanogaster . the mean dn/ds ratio decreased with removal of snps adjacent to homopolymer regions from  <dig>  to  <dig> . while interpretation of dn/ds ratios within populations is not unproblematic  <cit> , the assumption of negative  selection on most protein coding genes makes lower mean values seem more plausible.

we applied a threshold value for the minority allele of 7% for exclusion of snps, as approximately  <dig> haploid equivalents were sampled . this screening reduced the number of non-synonymous snps in high coverage tugs, removed the dependence of dn/ds on coverage, and removed the need to control for sampling biased by depth .

the final dn/ds estimates seem plausible, as d. melanogaster female reproductive tract transcripts have dn/ds of  <dig>   <cit>  and a roche  <dig> transcriptomic analysis of the parasitic nematode ancylostoma caninum reported dn/ds of  <dig>   <cit> . a dn/ds threshold  of  <dig>  has been suggested as threshold for assuming positive selection  <cit> . using this we identified  <dig> tugs that may be under positive selection, thirteen peptidases were under positive selection , and the go term peptidases was significantly overrepresented in the set of positively selected tugs. those thirteen peptidases are deeply conserved, as twelve had unique orthologue pairs in b. malayi and c. elgans. peptidases have previously been proposed to have acquired prominent roles in host-parasite interactions. an a. crassus trypsin-like proteinase may be utilised by the tissue-dwelling third stage larvae to penetrate host tissue and an aspartyl proteinase may be a blood meal digestive enzyme in adults  <cit> . the thirteen proteinases under positive selection could be targets of adaptive immunity developed against a. crassus <cit> , which is often only elicited against some but not all larvae  <cit> .

a set of  <dig> high-credibility snps with high information content for population genetic studies was identified by genotyping individual nematodes. the low number of snps inferred reflects both the variance in allele contribution introduced in transcriptomic data and the stringency of the software used, which is targeted at higher throughput genome sequence data  <cit> . nevertheless, levels of genome-wide heterozygosity found for the five adult nematodes examined are in agreement with existing microsattelite data that show reduced heterozygosity in european populations of a. crassus <cit> . the polish female nematode was the most highly inbred, while the nematode from the cultured an. japonica from taiwan was the most highly outbred.

while our experiment was not designed to identify differential expression between conditions  we used methods developed for comparison of cdna libraries  <cit>  to infer differential gene expression according to the origin of the sequencing libraries. this approach is widely used with  <dig> transcriptome data . we can only tentatively infer differential expression of a gene under different conditions  based on identification of significantly differential expression between libraries. genes over-expressed in the male a. crassus included major sperm proteins  <cit> , and, surprisingly, a suite of ribosomal proteins. collagen processing enzymes were overexpressed in the female nematodes in line with modulation of collagen synthesis in nematode embryonic development, and the ovoviviparity of this species  <cit> . acetyl-coa acetyltransferase was identified as overexpressed in european nematodes compared to the asian one. acetyl-coa acetyltransferases act in fatty-acid-oxidation in peroxisomes and mitochondria  <cit> . together with a change in steroid metabolism and the enrichment of mitochondrially localised enzymes these suggest changes in the energy metabolism of a. crassus from different origins. possible explanations could include a change to more or less aerobic processes in nematodes in europe due to their bigger size and/or increased availability of nutrients. tugs overexpressed in the female libraries showed elevated levels of dn/ds but genes overexpressed in males had decreased levels of dn/ds. the first finding is unexpected, as genes overexpressed in female libraries will also include tugs related to larval development , and these larval transcripts in turn are expected to be under purifying selection because of pleiotropic effects of genes in early development  <cit> . the second contrasts with findings that male specific traits and transcripts often show hallmarks of positive selection  <cit> . in a. caninum, female-specific transcripts showed an enrichment of parasitism genes”  <cit>  and a possible explanation would be a similar enrichment of positively selected parasitism-related genes in our dataset. for males the decreased dn/ds may be explained by the high number of ribosomal protein-encoding tugs, which all show very low levels of dn/ds. that these tugs were found to be differentially expressed remains puzzling. some male-overexpressed tugs, such as that encoding major sperm protein, showed elevated dn/ds. it is unlikely that correlation of differential expression with positive selection results from mapping artifacts, as all the ribosomal protein encoding tugs identified overexpressed in males have very low dn/ds.

genes differentially expressed according to the geographic origin of the nematodes showed significantly elevated levels of dn/ds. we interpret this as reflecting a correlation between sequence evolution and phenotypic modification in different host, environments or correlation between sequence evolution and evolution of gene expression. whether expression of these genes is modified in different hosts or evolved rapidly in the contemporary divergence between european and asian populations of a. crassus, is one focus of ongoing work building on the reference transcriptome presented here. for such an analysis it will be important to disentangle the influence of the host and the nematode population in common garden, co-inoculation experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
the a. crassus transcriptome provides a basis for a new era of molecular research on this ecologically important species. it will aid not only analysis of the invasive biology of this parasite, assisting in identifying the origins of invading populations as well as the adaptations that may be selected in the new european host, but also in the investigation of the acquisition of parasitism in the great clade of animal parasites, spirurina. in particular, positive selection of proteinases and differences in energy metabolism between european and asian a. crassus constitute a candidate phenotype relevant for phenotypic modification or contemporary divergent evolution as well as for the long term evolution of parasitism.
