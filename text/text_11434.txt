BACKGROUND
rna-seq, the sequencing of a population of rna transcripts using high-throughput sequencing technologies, profiles an entire transcriptome at single-base resolution whilst concurrently quantifying gene expression levels  <cit> . rna-seq can analyze subtle features of the transcriptome, such as novel transcript variants, allele-specific expression, and splice junctions  <cit> . previously, we performed a side-by-side comparison of rna-seq and microarray to investigate t-cell activation, and demonstrated that rna-seq is superior in detecting low abundance transcripts, and for differentiating biologically critical isoforms  <cit> . rna-seq also avoids technical limitations inherent to the microarray platform related to probe performance, such as cross-hybridization, limited detection range of individual probes, as well as non-specific hybridization  <cit> . with decreasing sequencing cost, rna-seq is becoming an attractive approach to profile gene expression or transcript abundance, and to evaluate differential expression among biological conditions.

current rna-seq approaches use shotgun sequencing technologies such as illumina, in which millions or even billions of short reads are generated from a randomly fragmented cdna library. after sequencing, the first step involves mapping those short reads to a genome or transcriptome. in recent years, a large number of mapping algorithms have been developed for read mapping and rna-seq differential analysis  <cit> . however, accurate alignment of high-throughput short rna-seq reads remains challenging, mainly because of junction  reads and the ambiguity of multiple-mapping reads. currently, many rna-seq alignment tools, including gsnap  <cit> , osa  <cit> , star  <cit> , mapsplice <cit> , and tophat  <cit> , use reference transcriptomes to inform the alignments of junction reads. in our previous study  <cit> , we had assessed the impact of using refgene   <cit>  on mapping short rna-seq reads, and demonstrated that without the assistance of refgene, more than one third of junction reads failed to map to the reference genome in the alignment process.

one aspect of transcriptome research is to quantify expression levels of genes, transcripts, and exons. acquiring the transcriptome expression profile requires genomic elements to be defined in the context of the genome. in addition to refgene, there are several other public human genome annotations, including ucsc known genes  <cit> , ensembl  <cit> , aceview  <cit> , vega  <cit> , and gencode <cit> . characteristics of these annotations differ because of variations in annotation strategies and information sources. refseq human gene models are well supported and broadly used in various studies. the ucsc known genes dataset is based on protein data from swiss-prot/trembl  and the associated mrna data from genbank, and serves as a foundation for the ucsc genome browser. vega genes are manually curated transcripts produced by the havana group at the welcome trust sanger institute, and are merged into ensembl. ensembl genes contain both automated genome annotation and manual curation, while the gene set of gencode corresponds to ensembl annotation since gencode version 3c . aceview provides a comprehensive non-redundant curated representation of all available human cdna sequences.

although there are multiple genome annotations available, researchers need to choose a genome annotation  while performing rna-seq data analysis. however, the effect of genome annotation choice on downstream rna-seq expression estimates is under-appreciated. wu et al.  <cit>  defined the complexity of human genome annotations in terms of the number of genes, isoforms, and exons, and demonstrated that the selection of human genome annotation results in different gene expression estimates. chen et al.  <cit>  systematically compared the human annotations present in refseq, ensembl, and aceview on diverse transcriptomic and genetic analyses. they found that the human gene annotations in the three databases are far from complete, although ensembl and aceview annotate many more genes than refseq. in this paper, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of different annotations on rna-seq data analysis, including refgene, ucsc, and ensembl. we chose these three gene models because we use them regularly for in-house rna-seq data analysis. our research focused on:  comparing the coverage and incompleteness of different gene models;  quantifying the impact of gene models on the mapping of both junction and non-junction reads; and  evaluating the effect of genome annotation choice on gene quantification and differential analysis. to a broader extent, one of the most practical questions researchers want to know in advance is: if different gene models are chosen for rna-seq data analysis, what is the chance of obtaining the same quantification result for a given gene?

RESULTS
the human body map  <dig>  project generated rna-seq data for  <dig> different human tissues . we chose to analyze this public dataset because gene expression is tissue specific and analyzing those  <dig> high-quality rna-seq samples as a whole could result in less biased conclusions. note that none of the gene annotation is 100% complete. as a result, for those rna-seq reads not covered by a gene annotation, whether to use the gene model in the mapping step has no impact on their mappings. therefore, to fairly assess the impact of a gene model on rna-seq read mapping, only those reads covered by a gene model were used. in this study, we devised a two-stage mapping protocol. in stage # <dig>  all reads that are not covered by a gene model were filtered out. in stage # <dig>  all remaining reads were mapped to the reference genome with and without the use of a gene model. the role of a gene model in the mapping step was then quantified and characterized by comparing the mapping results in stage # <dig> 

the coverage of different gene annotations
the rna-seq read mapping summaries for all  <dig> samples were shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  and additional file 1: table s <dig> , respectively. there are two different mapping modes in additional file 1: tables s <dig> and s <dig>  in the “transcriptome only” mapping mode, all rna-seq reads were mapped to a reference transcriptome only. if a read could not be mapped to a known gene region, it becomes unmapped, even though it could potentially be aligned to a genomic region without annotations. while in the “transcriptome + genome” mapping mode, reads were first mapped to a reference transcriptome, and then the unmapped ones were mapped to the reference genome. the impact of a reference transcriptome on the mapping of rna-seq reads is attenuated in the “transcriptome + genome” mapping mode because every unmapped read has a second chance to be mapped to a genome. the mapping summaries for the data in additional file 1: tables s <dig> and s <dig> were shown in figure  <dig> and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  respectively. in the “transcriptome only” mapping mode, more reads were mapped in ensembl than in refgene and/or ucsc. for each tissue type, the mapping rate was similar between refgene and ucsc. the average read mapping rates were 86%, 69%, and 70% for ensembl, refgene, and ucsc annotations, respectively. short-read mapping is a basic step in rna-seq data analyses, and to a certain extent, the percent of reads mapped to a given transcriptome can roughly reflect the completeness of its annotated genes and transcripts. thus, ensembl annotation has much broader gene coverage than refgene and ucsc.figure  <dig>

and

mapping modes . in the “transcriptome only” mode, more reads are mapped in ensembl than in refgene and ucsc , and more reads become multiple-mapped in ensembl than in refgene and ucsc . note: the gene model “none” means the rna-seq reads are mapped to the reference genome directly without the use of a gene model.



in contrast, figure  <dig> shows that the read mapping percentage is also sample dependent, and this holds true for every gene model. for instance, only  <dig> % of sequence reads in the heart were mapped to the refgene model; while in leukocytes,  <dig> % of reads could be mapped to refgene. this mapping difference between heart and leukocyte results from, at least in part, the incompleteness of the refgene annotation. as more genes are annotated in a gene model, a higher percentage of reads will be mapped in the “transcriptome only” mapping mode.

the data patterns in “transcriptome + genome” mapping mode were different from those determined by the “transcriptome only” mode . in the “transcriptome + genome” mapping mode, the average mapping rates for ensembl, refgene, and ucsc increased to  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively, and the mapping rate difference among different gene models decreased. this large difference in the mapping rates between the two modes suggests the incompleteness of gene models: there are many reads that were mapped to the genomic regions without annotations.

in the “transcriptome only” mapping mode, an average of  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of reads were multiple-mapped reads in ensembl, refgene, and ucsc gene models, respectively . the percentage of multiple-mapped reads in ensembl is higher than in refgene or ucsc. usually, a more comprehensive annotation generally annotates more genes and isoforms, and thus, increases the possibility of ambiguous mappings. these ambiguous mappings directly translate to an increase in the percentage of non-uniquely mapped reads.

the impact of a gene model on rna-seq read mapping
in stage # <dig>  the unmapped reads from the “transcriptome only” mapping mode were filtered out. in stage # <dig>  we remapped the remaining reads with and without the use of gene models. when gene models were used in stage # <dig>  all reads could be mapped, either uniquely or to multiple locations, and there were no unmapped reads. when those reads were remapped to genome without the use of gene models, some became unmapped. according to the number of mapped locations , all sequence reads were classified into three categories, unique , multiple , and unmapped . the rna-seq reads remapping summaries in stage # <dig> for all  <dig> samples were shown in figure  <dig>  and additional file 1: figure s <dig> , respectively. the numeric data corresponding to figure  <dig> and additional file 1: figure s <dig> were tabulated in additional file 1: tables s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively. the refgene and ucsc consistently had the highest percentage of uniquely mapped reads; while the percentage of non-uniquely mapped reads was much higher in ensembl . without a gene model, the percentage of unmapped reads was nearly constant at 6% . as we demonstrated as follows, a gene model mainly affects the alignment of junction reads, but has little impact on non-junction reads. on average, 23% of reads in our samples were junction reads, and usually about one third of them failed to be mapped without the use of a gene model. therefore, it is expected that ~6%  of the mapped reads become unmapped without the use of a gene model.figure  <dig> 
the effect of a gene model on the mapping summaries for  <dig> tissue samples . the refgene and ucsc consistently have the highest percentage of uniquely mapped reads; while the percentage of non-uniquely mapped reads is much higher in ensembl. without a gene model  in the mapping step, a constant 6% of reads become unmapped.



to evaluate the impact of a gene model on read mapping, the mapping summaries in figure  <dig> and additional file 1: figure s <dig> were not sufficient. for instance, a read could be aligned differently with and without the assistance of a gene model in mapping, and in this scenario, the mapping summary could not identify such a difference. thus, we compared the mapping details for every read, including start and end positions, and splicing sites. for simplicity, in stage # <dig>  we focused on uniquely mapped reads in the “transcriptome only” mapping mode. a uniquely mapped read could be classified into four categories according to its corresponding mapping information without a gene model:  “identical”—remaining mapped to the same genomic region;  “alternative”—still uniquely mapped but differently;  “multiple”—mapped to more locations; and  “unmapped”. the detailed evaluation results are summarized in figure  <dig>  and additional file 1: figure s <dig> , and reported in additional file 1: tables s <dig> and s <dig> figure  <dig> 
the impact of a gene model on rna-
seq read mapping .  composition of mapped reads: roughly 23% are junction reads, and the rest 77% are non-junction reads;  effect on mapping of non-junctions reads: on average, 95% remain mapped to exactly the same genomic location, whilst 3–9% of reads become multiple-mapped reads;  effect on mapping of junctions reads: an average of 53% of reads remain mapped to the same genomic regions without the assistance of a gene model. about 30% of junction reads fail to be mapped, while 10–15% map alternatively. .



in figure 3a, we divided uniquely mapped reads into two classes, i.e., non-junction reads and junction reads, and investigated the impact of a gene model on their mapping. accordingly to figure 3a, roughly 23% of mapped reads were junction reads, and the remaining 77% were non-junction reads. for non-junction reads , 95% remained mapped to exactly the same genomic location regardless of the use of a gene model. without a gene model, 3% to 9% of non-junctions reads became multiple mapped reads. thus, it is rare for a non-junction read to become unmapped or mapped alternatively. however, the mapping of junction reads was strongly impacted by the gene models . without using a gene model, an average of 53% of junction reads remained mapped to the same genomic regions, 30% of failed to map to any genomic region, and 10–15% of them mapped alternatively. such alternative mappings are generally inferior compared to their corresponding mapping results using a gene model  <cit> . similar to non-junction reads, an average of 5% of junction reads were mapped to more than one location without using a gene model. as shown in figure 3c, more uniquely-mapped junction reads became multiple mapped reads in refgene and/or ucsc than in ensembl when the sequence reads were aligned to the reference genome without the use of gene models.

the impact of gene model choice on gene quantification
different gene identifiers are used in different annotation databases; therefore, we mapped those database-specific identifiers into the unique hgnc gene symbols from the hugo gene nomenclature committee when comparing their gene quantification results across the different gene models originating from these databases. considering that annotations are more or less incomplete in these databases, we only focused on common genes. the venn diagram in figure  <dig> showed the overlap and intersection of refgene, ucsc, and ensembl annotations. clearly refgene has fewest unique genes, while more that 50% of genes in ensembl are unique. in general, the different annotations have very high overlaps:  <dig>  common genes are shared by all three gene annotations.figure  <dig>

ucsc,
and ensembl annotations. in general, different annotations have very high overlaps: there are  <dig>  common genes shared by all three gene models. refgene has the fewest unique genes, while more than 50% of genes in ensembl are unique.



to investigate the impact of different gene models on gene quantification results, we focused on this set of  <dig>  common genes. the overall correlation between refgene and ensembl was shown in figure  <dig>  both x and y-axes represented log <dig>  for all genes,  <dig> was added to the counts to avoid a logarithmic error for those genes with zero counts. ideally, we should get identical numbers of mapped reads for all common genes, regardless of the choice of a gene model; however, this was clearly not the case. although the majority of genes had highly consistent or nearly identical expression levels, there were a significant number of genes whose quantification results were dramatically affected by the choice of a gene model. as shown in figure  <dig>  there were many genes for which the number of reads mapped to them was  <dig> in one gene model, but many in others.figure  <dig> 
the correlation of gene quantification results between refgene and ensembl. both x and y-axes represent log <dig>  although the majority of genes have highly consistent or nearly identical expression levels, there are many genes whose quantification results are dramatically affected by the choice of a gene model.



to quantify the concordance between refgene and ensembl annotations, we first calculated the ratio of mapped read for each gene. for a given gene, we defined the raw read counts in refgene and ensembl annotations as #c <dig> and #c <dig>  respectively. to prevent division by  <dig>   <dig> was added to all raw read counts before the ratios were calculated. the adjusted counts were denoted as #c1’  and #c2’ , respectively. the ratio was calculated as max/min. therefore the calculated ratio was always equal or greater than  <dig>  the distribution of ratios was summarized in table  <dig> . among the  <dig>  common genes, about 20% of genes had no expression at all in both annotations. identical counts were obtained for only  <dig> % of genes. approximately  <dig> % of genes’ expression levels differed by 5% or higher, and among them,  <dig> % of genes  differed by 50% or greater. as shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  the choice of a gene model had a large impact on gene quantification. the concordance between ucsc and refgene annotation was reported in additional file 1: table s <dig> . compared with ensembl, ucsc had a much better concordance with refgene, in terms of the gene quantification results.  <dig> % of genes had identical read counts, much higher than the  <dig> % between ensembl and refgene. the percentage of genes with expression levels differing by 5% or more was only  <dig> %, which was much less than the corresponding 28% between ensembl and refgene. furthermore, only  <dig> % of genes‘ quantification results differed by 50% or greater, which was lower than the  <dig> % between ensembl and refgene.table  <dig>

note: column “no expr” represents the percentage of genes that do not express at all in both annotations. column “same” denotes the percentage of genes that have the same number of reads mapped to them in both gene models. the number in each cell after the column “same” corresponds to the percentage of genes whose ratio is equal or greater than the threshold represented by the number.



why does the choice of a gene model have so dramatic an effect on gene quantification? below, we chose a few extreme or representative cases to provide possible explanations. in the liver sample, the expression levels for these exemplary genes for both ensembl and refgene were summarized in table  <dig> . pik3ca  uses atp to phosphorylate ptdins, ptdins4p, and ptdinsp <dig>  in the liver sample, there were  <dig> reads mapped to pik3ca in ensembl annotation, while only  <dig> reads were mapped in refgene. the pik3ca gene definition in both ensembl and refgene, and the mapping profile of rna-seq reads were shown in figure  <dig>  clearly, the difference in gene definition gives rise to the observed discrepancy in quantification. in ensembl, there are three isoforms for pik3ca, and the longest isoform is enst <dig>  the total length of this transcript is 9653 bp, comprising  <dig> exons, with a very long exon # <dig> . in refgene, pik3ca has only one transcript named nm_ <dig>  this transcript is 3909 bp long with a very short exon # <dig> . the definition of pik3ca gene in ensembl seems more accurate than the one in refgene, based upon the mapping profile of the sequence reads. likewise, the difference in read counts for gene egfr and slc30a <dig> in ensembl and refgene mainly results from the gene definition difference .table  <dig>

1068the different gene definitions for pik3ca give rise to differences in gene quantification. pik3ca in the ensembl annotation is much longer than its definition in refgene, explaining why there are  <dig> reads mapped to pik3ca in ensembl, while only  <dig> reads are mapped in refgene. the pik3ca gene definition in ensembl seems more accurate than the one in refgene, based upon the mapping profile of sequence reads.



figure  <dig> shows another example of a remarkably different gene model defined in ensembl versus that in refgene. in refgene, a bi-cistronic transcript encodes the products of both the mtpn  and luzp <dig>  genes, which are located on chromosome  <dig>  all mapped reads are equally distributed to these two genes. the mature transcript is 3884 bp in refgene. however, in ensembl, luzp <dig> is only 177 bp long, and is completely within mtpn. as a consequence, all reads mapped to the overlapping region are assigned to mtpn only because luzp <dig> does not have any unique reads mapped to it, which explains why the read count for luzp <dig> was  <dig> when ensembl annotation was chosen. likewise, the difference in gene definition  can explain the quantification results for pigy/pyurf in table  <dig>  the gene pigy in ensembl is only 217 bp long and overlaps completely with pyurf . thus, all reads mapped to the region of pigy are assigned to gene pyurf, while no read is given to pigy. in refgene, pigy and pyurf encode exactly the same mrna, although the translated protein sequences are different. thus, all reads mapped to pigy/pyurf are equally distributed to these two genes. the gene pecam <dig> is another interesting example. it is located on chromosome  <dig> in the refgene model. in ensembl, however, this gene is located on chromosome hg183_patch:  <dig> ,863- <dig> , <dig>  hg183_patch is not included in the human genome grch <dig>  at all, explaining why zero reads mapped to gene pecam <dig> using ensembl annotation.figure  <dig> 
the different gene definitions for luzp <dig>  in the ensembl annotation, luzp <dig> is only 177 bp long, and it is completely within another gene, mtpn. as a result, all sequence reads originating from luzp <dig> are assigned to mtpn instead. in refgene, luzp <dig> and mtpn are derived from the same genomic region, and both encode exactly the same mrna, though the protein coding sequences are different. therefore, all reads mapped to this region are equally distributed between these two genes.



the effect of gene models on differential analysis
generally, rna-seq differential analysis requires biological replicates. however, we analyzed single samples from  <dig> different tissues. to demonstrate the effect of gene models on differential analysis, the fold changes between heart and liver samples were calculated using refgene and ensembl annotations. the correlation of the calculated log2ratio  was depicted in figure  <dig>  the graph should show a perfect diagonal line if the choice of a gene model has no effect on differential analysis. although the majority of genes have highly consistent or comparable expression changes, there are a number of genes whose ratios are dramatically affected by the choice of a gene model. interestingly, some genes have a very high fold change in one gene model, but no change at all in another gene model. evidently, the choice of a gene model has an effect on the downstream differential expression analysis, in addition to gene quantification.figure  <dig> 
the correlation of the calculated log2ratio

between refgene and ensembl. the green, blue, and red points indicate corresponding absolute difference between the two log2ratios that were greater than  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig>  respectively. although the majority of genes have highly consistent expression changes, there are many genes that are remarkably affected by the choice of different gene models.



the effect of a gene model on mapping is read length dependent
all the analysis results for the dataset with a 50-bp read length were reported in the supplementary tables and figures. intuitively, the shorter a read, the more likely it is to map to multiple locations. as a result, the percentage of uniquely mapped reads decreases, and the percentage of multiple-mapping reads increases. no matter which gene model was used for mapping, this observation held true; for example if we compare additional file 1: table s <dig> with additional file 1: table s <dig>  and/or additional file 1: table s <dig> with additional file 1: table s <dig>  thus, the mapping fidelity for a sequence read increases with its length, and this is especially true for junction reads. as demonstrated in figure 3c and additional file 1: table s <dig>  when the read length was 75 bp, an average of 53% of junction reads remained mapped to the same genomic regions when mapped without gene annotation. however, this percentage dropped to 42% when the read length was 50 bp long . thus, the effect of a gene model on the mapping of junction reads is significantly influenced by read length.

in the meantime, the relative abundance of junction reads is heavily determined by read length.

according to figure 3a and additional file 1: table s <dig>  on average, roughly 23% of sequence reads were junction reads when the read length was 75 bp. the percentage of junction reads dropped to 16% when the read length was 50 bp . this is explained by the fact that the longer the read, the more likely that it spans more than one exon. as sequencing technology evolves, the read length will become longer and longer. consequently, more junction reads will be generated by short-gun sequencing technologies. therefore, the need to incorporate genome annotation in the read mapping process will greatly increase.

which genome annotation to choose for gene quantification?
in practice, there is no simple answer to this question, and it depends on the purpose of the analysis. in this paper, we demonstrated that the choice of a gene model has an effect on the quantification results. previously, we compared the gene quantification results when refgene and ensembl annotations were used. among  <dig>  common genes, the expressions of  <dig> genes  differed by 50% or more when choosing one annotation over the other. such a large difference frequently results from the gene definition differences in the annotations. genes with the same hugo symbol in different gene models can be defined as completely different genomic regions. when choosing an annotation database, researchers should keep in mind that no database is perfect and some gene annotations might be inaccurate or entirely wrong.

wu et al.  <cit>  suggested that when conducting research that emphasizes reproducible and robust gene expression estimates, a less complex genome annotation, such as refgene, might be preferred. when conducting more exploratory research, a more complex genome annotation, such as ensembl, should be chosen. based upon our experience of rna-seq data analysis, we recommend using refgene annotation if rna-seq is used as a replacement for a microarray in transcriptome profiling. for human samples, affymetrix genechip ht hg-u133+ pm arrays are one of the most popular microarray platforms for transcriptome profiling, and the genes covered by this chip overlap with refgene very well, according to zhao et al.  <cit>  h. despite the fact that ensembl r <dig> contains  <dig>  annotated gene entries, only  <dig>  entries  correspond to protein coding genes. there are  <dig>  entries representing various types of rnas, including rrna , snorna , snrna , mirna , misc_rna , and lincrna . there are  <dig>  pseudogenes in ensembl r <dig>  for most rna-seq sequencing projects, only mrnas are presumably enriched and sequenced, and there is no point in mapping sequence reads to rnas such as mirnas or lincrnas. ensembl r <dig> contains  <dig> processed transcripts that were generated by reverse transcription of an mrna transcript with subsequent reintegration of the cdna into the genome, and are usually not actively expressed. in this scenario, a read truly originating from an active mrna can be mapped to the processed transcript or mapped to the processed transcript only, which is especially true for junction reads. consequently, the true expression for the corresponding mrna may be underestimated. another downside of using a larger annotation database is calculation of adjusted p values, because the adjustment of the raw p value to allow for multiple testing is mainly determined by the number of genes in the model. if genes of interest are defined inconsistently across different annotations, it is recommended that the rna-seq dataset is analyzed using different gene models.

CONCLUSIONS
rna-seq has become increasingly popular in transcriptome profiling. acquiring transcriptome expression profiles requires researchers to choose a genome annotation for rna-seq data analysis. in this paper, we assessed the impact of gene models on the mapping of junction and non-junction reads, and compared the impact of genome annotation choice on gene quantification and differential analysis. to fairly assess the impact of a gene model on rna-seq read mapping, we devised a two-stage mapping protocol, in which sequence reads that could not be mapped to a reference transcriptome were filtered out, and the remaining reads were mapped to the reference genome with and without the use of a gene model in the mapping step. our protocol ensured that only those reads compatible with a gene model were used to evaluate the role of a genome annotation in rna-seq data analysis.

ensembl annotates more genes than refgene and ucsc. on average, 95% of non-junction reads were mapped to exactly the same genomic location without the use of a gene model. however, only an average of 53% junction reads remained mapped to the same genomic regions. about 30% of junction reads failed to be mapped without the assistance of a gene model, while 10–15% mapped alternatively. it is also demonstrated that the effect of a gene model on the mapping of sequence reads is significantly influenced by read length. the mapping fidelity for a sequence read increases with its length. when the read length was reduced from 75 bp to 50 bp, the percentage of junction reads that remained mapped to the same genomic regions dropped from 53% to 42% without the assistance of gene annotation.

there are  <dig>  common genes among refgene, ensembl, and ucsc annotations. using the dataset with the read length of 75 bp, we compared the gene quantification results in refgene and ensembl annotations, and obtained identical counts for an average of  <dig> %  of genes. twenty percent of genes are not expressed, and thus have zero counts in both annotations. about  <dig> % of genes showed expression levels that differed by 5% or higher; of these, the relative expression levels for  <dig> % of genes  differed by 50% or greater. the case studies revealed that the difference in gene definitions caused the observed inconsistency in gene quantification.
