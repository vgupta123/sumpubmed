BACKGROUND
plant fibres constitute a valuable renewable resource for pulp, paper and bioenergy production  <cit> . in angiosperms, the two principle sclerenchyma cell types that comprise secondary xylem are xylem vessels, which facilitate the transport of water, and xylary fibres, which provide mechanical strength and which make up the bulk of woody biomass  <cit> . wood density and chemical composition, fibre and vessel length, diameter and wall thickness, and even the proportion of axial and radial parenchyma heavily influence pulp yield, digestibility and quality, although the relative importance of each varies from species to species  <cit> .

during xylogenesis in angiosperms, fibres differentiate from the vascular cambium, elongate, and deposit a lignified secondary cell wall . scw formation is associated with a distinct form of programmed cell death  <cit> . much research has been devoted to the biosynthesis of scw biopolymers, namely  cellulose  <cit> , hemicellulose  <cit>  and lignin  <cit> . complementing this, in the past six years much of the transcriptional network underlying scw biosynthesis has been deciphered, mainly exploiting arabidopsis thaliana and the zinnia elegans mesophyll-to-tracheary element in vitro transdifferentiation system  <cit> . genes involved in secondary xylem formation are regulated principally at the transcriptional level, accentuating the central significance of the scw transcriptional network  <cit> . manipulation of transcription factors  associated with the network presents the potential to enhance fibre properties through altering the regulation of a large number of biosynthetic genes.

kubo et al.  <cit>  first identified nac domain tfs vascular-related nac-domain <dig>  and vnd <dig> as "master activators" of scw formation in proto- and metaxylem vessels, respectively. it was later shown that vnd <dig> and vnd <dig> are functionally redundant, being sufficient for all vessel scw formation  <cit> . in xylem fibres, a similar transcriptional master switch was identified. nac family proteins secondary wall-associated nac domain <dig>  and nac secondary wall thickening promoting factor <dig>  redundantly activate arabidopsis fibre  scw formation  <cit> . in other cell types with secondary walls, such as the endothecium of anthers, nst <dig> was also found to activate scw development, in this case redundantly with nst <dig>  <cit> . together, these studies support a role for nac tfs as principal activators of scw formation in fibres and vessels, acting in distinct combinations in each case.

several studies suggest that snd <dig>  nst <dig>  vnd <dig> and vnd <dig> activate a conserved, cascading transcriptional network featuring, but by no means limited to, various nac, myb and homeodomain tfs . snd <dig>  nst <dig>  nst <dig>  vnd <dig> and vnd <dig> regulate an overlapping set of targets  <cit> , supported by the ability of nst <dig>  vnd <dig> and vnd <dig> to complement the snd <dig> nst <dig> double mutant when ectopically expressed in fibre cells  <cit> . for this reason, they have been collectively referred to as secondary wall nacs   <cit> . amongst the downstream targets of swns, snd <dig> and myb <dig> are directly activated by snd1/nst <dig> and vnd6/vnd <dig>  <cit> , although snd <dig> has not consistently been detected as a vnd6/vnd <dig> direct target. snd <dig> is indirectly regulated by snd1/nst <dig>  <cit> , but there exists no evidence for regulation by vnd6/vnd <dig>  loss- and gain-of-function mutagenesis of snd <dig>  but interestingly also that of snd <dig> and myb <dig>  produced a fibre-specific phenotype  <cit> . whilst dominant repression  <cit>  drastically reduced fibre-specific scw thickness, individual overexpression of myb <dig>  snd <dig> and snd <dig> increased scw thickness in interfascicular and xylary fibres, with no apparent impact on vessels. in stems a reduction in glucose, xylose and mannose cell wall sugars occurred during dominant repression of myb <dig>  snd <dig> or snd <dig>  conversely, all three tfs could transactivate the scw cellulose-associated cesa <dig> gene promoter, but not representatives of hemicellulose  or lignin  biosynthesis  <cit> .

the regulation and function of snd <dig> may differ in herbaceous and woody plants, especially in woody tissues which possess greater proportions of fibre cells than stems of herbaceous plants. this may be facilitated by gene family expansion and specialization in woody plants  <cit> . as many as four putative snd <dig> orthologs exist in poplar due to significant expansion of the nac family  <cit> , some paralogs of which may have undergone subfunctionalization in populus  <cit> . all four putative orthologs were found to be preferentially expressed in developing xylem and phloem fibres  <cit> . overexpression of one of the putative orthologs, popnac <dig>  resulted in a decrease in height and an increase in the proportion of bark to xylem in poplar trees, with no perceptible effect on scw thickness  <cit> . this apparent conflict with the snd <dig> overexpression phenotype in arabidopsis  <cit>  illustrates that the regulatory function of snd <dig> homologs may differ between herbaceous and woody plants.

the observation that snd <dig> overexpression led to enhanced scw formation in arabidopsis fibres and that it potentially regulates cellulosic genes are important findings, because evidence supports the existence of a similar transcriptional network regulating fibre scw development in angiosperm trees  <cit> . however, several aspects of the biological function of snd <dig> remain to be resolved before the biotechnological potential of the gene can be determined. the global targets of snd <dig> have not been identified and its position in the transcriptional network has not been established. the finding that snd <dig> regulates cellulose, but not xylan and lignin biosynthetic genes, was based on a single representative gene from each pathway  <cit> . a greater knowledge of snd <dig> targets is required to confidently negate its regulation of hemicellulose and lignin biosynthesis. it is also unclear from the analysis by zhong et al.  <cit>  whether snd <dig> overexpression invariably leads to increased fibre scw thickness, both in arabidopsis and in woody taxa. finally, the effect of snd <dig> overexpression on cell wall chemistry has not yet been reported.

we aimed to further characterize the position and regulatory role of snd <dig> in the fibre scw transcriptional network, and confirm the phenotypic effects of snd <dig> overexpression in arabidopsis and eucalyptus plants. our objectives were to identify genes that are differentially expressed in snd2-overexpressing plants, and determine the overall effect on arabidopsis development and biomass production, as well as fibre scw formation in arabidopsis and eucalyptus. we describe novel regulatory roles for snd <dig> in fibre scw development, and propose a model for the role of snd <dig> in the transcriptional network regulating scw formation.

RESULTS
whole-transcriptome expression profiling of snd2-overexpressing arabidopsis plants
snd <dig> was previously shown to transactivate the cesa <dig> gene promoter in arabidopsis protoplasts  <cit> . in order to identify other genes regulated by snd <dig> in planta, we overexpressed snd <dig> in arabidopsis plants by cloning the snd <dig> coding sequence into the overexpression vector pmdc <dig>  <cit> . we introduced the construct into a. thaliana col- <dig> plants and randomly selected three homozygous t <dig> lines , from a pool of t <dig> transgenic plants herein denoted "snd2-ov". we confirmed that snd <dig> was strongly upregulated in the t <dig> snd2-ov lines using rt-qpcr analysis . we then tested the t <dig> snd2-ov lines for preliminary evidence of cesa <dig> upregulation in lower inflorescence stems using rt-qpcr analysis. interestingly, line a ") exclusively showed evidence for cesa <dig> upregulation , and was therefore selected for transcriptome analysis.

in order to determine which genes were differentially expressed as a result of snd <dig> overexpression in arabidopsis stems, the transcriptome of snd2-ov plants was compared to that of the wild type with respect to the bottom  <dig> mm of primary inflorescence stems. high quality total rna  was isolated from three biological replicates of eight-week-old wild type and snd2-ov plant stems, and labelled cdna hybridized to agilent  <dig> × 44k arabidopsis transcriptome arrays. significantly differentially expressed genes  were identified as those with an experiment-wise false discovery rate below  <dig>  and fold change > |± <dig> |. this analysis identified a total of  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes in snd2-ov relative to the wild type .

in order to identify overrepresented gene ontology  classes amongst the degs, the gotoolbox resource  <cit>  was interrogated with a hypergeometric test  using the arabidopsis information resource  <cit>  annotation set. significantly enriched biological processes  revealed a predominant role of the degs in  cell wall organization and biogenesis, carbohydrate metabolism, signalling and response to stimulus .

identification of putative snd <dig> targets
snd <dig> is preferentially expressed in xylem  <cit> . we hypothesized that targets of snd <dig> would be co-expressed with endogenous snd <dig> transcripts. the tissue-specific expression of degs identified in snd2-ov  was explored by observing the expression patterns across selected arabidopsis tissues using the genevestigator v <dig>  <cit>  anatomy clustering tool. at the time of analysis, the genevestigator database totalled  <dig> publicly available microarray studies for arabidopsis, encompassing  <dig> samples. of  <dig> genes in our snd2-ov dataset,  <dig> were represented by unique probe sets on high quality ath <dig> 22k arrays. we examined the endogenous expression of these genes across  <dig> tissues based on results from  <dig> arrays, and subjected the genes to hierarchical clustering according to their absolute expression profiles. the majority of genes did not conform to a single expression pattern, with only ~9% of the genes displaying expression profiles clearly resembling that of native snd <dig> transcript, i.e. with preferential expression in scw-containing tissues . thus, the majority of genes differentially expressed as a result of snd <dig> overexpression were not generally associated with scw-containing tissues.

novel targets arising from ectopic overexpression of cell wall-associated nac tfs have been reported previously  <cit> . it is possible that a similar phenomenon occurred in our study, since the bulk of the sampled transgenic stems comprised tissues where snd <dig> is not naturally expressed. this may explain the small proportion of degs that were co-expressed with snd <dig> in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  to avoid this possibility, we stringently defined the putative authentic targets of snd <dig> as those that were also a subset of snd1-regulated genes, the latter identified by microarray analysis of snd1-overexpressing arabidopsis plants by ko et al.  <cit> . the age of the plants in the cited study  and the tissue sampled  was similar to our experiment. snd <dig>  a known indirect target of snd <dig>  <cit> , was the most strongly upregulated tf in the snd1-overexpressing plant stems  <cit> , further justifying our approach.

we extracted genes common to the ko et al.  <cit>  data and our significant snd2-ov microarray data, without fold-change filtering. seventy five genes were shared between the two datasets, herein denoted "snd2∩ko", ~79% of which were regulated in a consistent direction . amongst them, genes involved in transcription,  cell wall biosynthesis, cell wall expansion and modification, carbohydrate metabolism, stress response and proteins of unknown function were prominent . there was notably no differential expression of monolignol biosynthetic genes.

ctransgene. the fold change is likely an underestimate of the actual value because this target displayed a saturated hybridization signal

we independently assessed the possible function of snd <dig> by identifying genes co-expressed with native snd <dig> transcript from the atgenexpress plus extended tissue set public microarray data using expression angler  <cit> , employing a stringent pearson correlation coefficient threshold . genes associated with scw biosynthesis  as well as tfs previously implicated in scw regulation , were amongst the  <dig> genes found to be co-expressed with snd <dig> , supporting a role of snd <dig> in scw regulation.  <dig> of the genes were differentially expressed in the snd2∩ko data .

expression angler  <cit>  was used to find co-expressed genes in the atgenexpress plus extended tissue set microarray data. the r-value represents the pearson correlation coefficient of co-expression, set to a threshold of r >  <dig> . co-expressed genes that were also differentially expressed in the snd2∩ko subset of snd <dig> overexpression data  are indicated in the far right column.

the seventy five snd2∩ko genes represented on the ath <dig> 22k array were subjected to hierarchical clustering across the genevestigator v <dig> arabidopsis anatomy database  <cit>  as before to analyze their tissue specificity. unique probe sets were found for all but one gene . one cluster  contained  <dig> genes preferentially expressed in a similar fashion to snd <dig>  namely in inflorescence nodes and stem, rosette stem and xylem, and silique . another cluster of  <dig> genes  appeared to exhibit preferential expression in inflorescence stems and nodes, rosette stems, and occasionally seedling hypocotyls, root steles and anther-containing stamens, all of which contain scws to some degree. thus, compared to the original snd2-ov dataset, a much higher percentage  of genes in the snd2∩ko dataset displayed preferential expression in tissues containing scws. combined with the atgenexpress co-expression analysis, these data support the role of snd <dig> in scw regulation and the validity of the snd2∩ko dataset as the most likely direct or indirect targets of snd <dig> 

the microarray results were validated by rt-qpcr analysis. we profiled fifteen genes based on the microarray rna isolated from stems of eight-week-old snd2-ov and wild type plants . all rt-qpcr profiles agreed with the microarray data, and seven genes were significantly  upregulated . we also confirmed that the endogenous snd <dig> transcript showed no significant change in snd2-ov stems, whereas total snd <dig> transcript abundance  in snd2-ov stems was ~180-fold that of the wild type . we obtained similar results for selected genes from plants grown in an independent trial .

we were interested in the temporal effect of inflorescence stem development on the putative targets of snd <dig> when constitutively expressed. we therefore performed a second microarray analysis of snd2-ov and wild type plants at four weeks of age, sampling inflorescence stems that were ~ <dig> mm tall. of the  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated degs, no snd2∩ko candidates were present, nor were any scw biosynthesis-associated genes . this result suggests that an additional co-regulator, only expressed after four weeks, is required for snd <dig> to function in fibre scw regulation.

effect of snd <dig> overexpression on arabidopsis scw thickness, biomass and scw composition
zhong et al.  <cit>  previously reported that snd <dig> overexpression significantly increased scw thickness in interfascicular fibres  of arabidopsis inflorescence stems. however, amongst our homozygous snd2-ov lines, scanning electron microscopy  revealed no significant changes in fibre wall thickness for lines a and b, whilst line c had significantly thinner scws than the wild type . these results were reproduced in an independent trial using light microscopy .

fibre scw thickness was additionally assessed in lower inflorescence stems of seven t <dig> snd2-ov and eight wild type plants using light microscopy. representative micrographs are shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  the t <dig> lines manifested a significant  decrease in mean if scw thickness  that resembled snd2-ov line c and the snd <dig> dominant repression phenotype reported previously  <cit> . combined endogenous and transgenic snd <dig> transcript abundance from t <dig> plants exceeded that of the wild type plants by ~435-fold, ruling out co-suppression as an explanation for the phenotype . although no significant correlation could be found between snd <dig> transcript abundance and scw thickness, our data confirm that strong snd <dig> overexpression reduces if scw thickness.

we hypothesized that snd <dig> overexpression could influence overall inflorescence stem biomass, irrespective of if scw thickness. the entire inflorescence stems of eight-week-old t <dig> snd2-ov lines a, b and c were weighed to determine total biomass yield. only in the most highly overexpressing line, snd2-ov line c, was biomass significantly different from the wild type, where fresh and dry biomass was decreased . this was despite the fact that all snd2-ov lines appeared phenotypically normal and exhibited no stunting or dwarfing . biomass profiles in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig> were in agreement with the if scw thickness profile for each respective line , suggesting a direct relationship between if scw thickness and biomass yield, and therefore a negative effect of excessive snd <dig> overexpression on biomass yield.

the chemical composition of the inflorescence stems was investigated by klason lignin analysis and quantification of monosaccharides following complete acid hydrolysis. snd2-ov exhibited a nominal but statistically significant  <dig> % relative decrease in total lignin . this was likely due to a reduction in insoluble lignin . no changes were apparent in the relative abundance of glucose and xylose, and only mannose and rhamnose were significantly increased in line a  by  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively . we also quantified the chemical composition of snd2-ov line c to investigate scw composition when fibre wall thickness was reduced. however, no change in lignin or monosaccharide content was detected against the wild type .

values are expressed as the mean of three biological replicates plus or minus the standard error of the mean. p-values are based on paired two-tailed student's t-tests between snd2-ov and the wild type.

induced somatic overexpression of snd <dig> in eucalyptus stem sectors
compared to herbaceous annuals such as arabidopsis, woody perennials devote a larger proportion of carbon allocation to xylem formation. we therefore examined the effect of arabidopsis snd <dig> overexpression on xylem fibre characteristics in eucalyptus trees by induced somatic sector analysis  <cit> . stems were transformed with a pcambia <dig>  construct  overexpressing snd <dig>  tree stems were harvested after 195- <dig> days, transgenic sectors were identified in the cross-sections via gus reporter staining, and etched to delineate the transgenic sectors prior to sem analysis .

fibre dimensions were measured from sem micrographs as a percentage change between eleven transgenic sectors and adjacent wild type sectors for the snd2-overexpressing gene construct, as well as nine empty vector control  sectors expressing only the gus reporter. fibre cell area  was significantly increased in snd2-ov sectors compared to evc sectors , demonstrating that snd <dig> influences fibre development in eucalyptus. fibre cell wall area and lumen area, which comprise fibre cell area, were marginally increased in snd2-overexpressing sectors relative to evc sectors, but the differences were not statistically significant for these individual parameters. however, since the increase in cell wall area in snd2-overexpressing sectors was close to significant , it is reasonable to suggest that the increase in fibre cell area was mainly due to a cell wall area increase rather than a lumen area contribution. measurement of fibre cell area in the arabidopsis t <dig> and t <dig> snd2-ov lines revealed no significant differences relative to the wild type .

snd2-overexpressing  and empty vector control  sector values are expressed as a percentage change relative to non-transformed tissues. measurements were obtained from  <dig>  and  <dig>  transgenic-nontransgenic control sector pairs from two f <dig> eucalyptus hybrids. p values are based on one-tailed student's t-test.

discussion
a role for snd <dig> in regulating arabidopsis fibre scw formation was previously suggested by studies establishing it as an indirect target of snd <dig>  a master regulator of fibre scw development  <cit> . in promoter transactivation experiments, snd <dig> was implicated in the regulation of cellulose , but a role in regulating hemicellulose or lignin biosynthesis seemed unlikely  <cit> . a particularly interesting finding was a fibre cell-specific increase in scw thickness when snd <dig> was constitutively overexpressed, mirrored by decreased fibre scw thickness in dominant repression lines  <cit> . the proposed role of snd <dig> in arabidopsis fibre scw formation has not been independently validated and the full suite of genes regulated by snd <dig> has not been elucidated. to address this, we performed microarray analysis on a homozygous snd <dig> overexpressing line, snd2-ov, which also exhibited significant upregulation of the cesa <dig> gene.

tfs have been shown to activate novel targets when ectopically expressed. a striking example was described by bennett et al.  <cit>  for nac tfs regulating primary cell wall modification in the root cap. overexpression in stems caused ectopic lignification and ectopic expression of scw genes  <cit> . our microarray results therefore likely include direct and indirect targets of snd <dig>  as well as genes misregulated due to the ectopic overexpression of snd <dig>  to discriminate native targets of snd <dig>  we defined a subset of genes  regulated by snd <dig>  <cit>  that were also found to be differentially expressed in this study . we reasoned that obtaining the snd <dig> subset of targets would be a robust approach for reducing ectopic noise, because snd <dig> is indirectly, but strongly activated by snd <dig>  <cit>  and native snd <dig> targets should therefore be a subset of the snd <dig> targets. further support for defining these seventy five genes as putative snd <dig> targets was provided by the finding that a large proportion  of genes co-regulated  with snd <dig> in a large compendium of atgenexpress microarray experiments were included in the snd2∩ko set . recently, zhong et al.  <cit>  demonstrated transactivation of poplar cesa <dig>  cesa <dig>  gt <dig> and gt <dig> family gene promoters by a poplar co-ortholog of snd <dig>  providing a third line of evidence that snd <dig> regulates scw-associated genes.

the snd2∩ko set  prominently included genes involved in scw biosynthesis, transcriptional regulation and signalling. amongst the scw-associated genes, cesa <dig>  cesa <dig> and cesa <dig> are involved in scw cellulose biosynthesis  <cit> . cobl <dig> and its orthologs also appear to be involved in scw cellulose formation  <cit> , and recently a homolog of trichome birefringence, tbl <dig> , was shown to affect secondary cellulose deposition and possibly scw structure through alterations in pectin methylesterification  <cit> . parvus, irx <dig> and irx <dig> are required for xylan biosynthesis in scws  <cit> . irx <dig> and irx15l, encoding functionally redundant duf <dig> proteins, were recently shown to be essential for normal xylan biosynthesis  <cit> , but only the former was upregulated in snd2-ov stems . pgsip <dig> and uxs <dig> are co-expressed with xylan synthases, with good evidence supporting a xylan α-glucuronosyltransferase function for pgsip <dig>  <cit>  and a udp-xylose synthase function for uxs <dig>  <cit> . as shown previously  <cit> , snd <dig> did not activate the xylan-associated irx <dig> gene in this study, nor did it activate lignin-associated 4cl <dig>  lac <dig> and lac <dig> encode laccases, an enzyme group that has been linked to scw lignin polymerization  <cit> . lac <dig> and lac <dig> are regulated by lignin-specific tfs myb <dig> and myb <dig>  <cit>  and were also recently shown to affect lignification in arabidopsis xylem, with lac <dig> specifically implicated in g-lignin polymerization in ifs  <cit> . our results  thus suggest an additional role for snd <dig> in the regulation of lignification distinct from that of monolignol biosynthesis.

several tfs were upregulated in the snd2∩ko set . anac <dig> regulates biotic and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . at4g <dig> is a c3hc <dig> ring-type zinc finger gene of unknown function. however, at least one c3hc <dig> gene, at1g <dig>  has been previously implicated in scw formation  <cit> . we observed upregulation of rap <dig> l, an ethylene response factor involved in shoot regeneration and abiotic stress response  <cit> . the upregulation of snd <dig> and myb <dig> in snd <dig> plants was unexpected. snd <dig>  a master activator of scw biosynthesis in fibres  <cit> , is expected to be upstream of snd <dig> in the transcriptional network. it also seems intuitive that snd <dig> acts downstream of myb <dig>  since snd <dig> is an indirect target of snd <dig>  whilst myb <dig> is a direct target of snd <dig>  <cit> . a positive feedback loop may exist through which upregulation of snd <dig>  or another tf , promotes snd <dig> expression.

recently, a signal transduction pathway based on a mammalian signalling model was proposed for scw biosynthesis in arabidopsis and rice . differentially expressed genes in snd2∩ko included those encoding the principal proteins of this machinery , namely fla11/fla <dig>  ctl <dig> , an lrr kinase , rac , iq  and ric . chitinase-like  <dig> , which lacks chitinase or chitin-binding activity  <cit> , might interact with fla11/ <dig> in a similar way to the interaction of mammalian chitinase-like protein si-clp with a fasciclin domain-containing transmembrane receptor, stabilin- <dig>  <cit> . two additional kinases  could possibly be involved in this signalling cascade. based on these findings, we propose a revised model for the role of snd <dig> in the transcriptional network underlying fibre scw deposition . under this model, snd <dig> directly or indirectly upregulates the genes associated with this signalling machinery. the nature of this regulatory relationship remains to be resolved.

despite the upregulation of the associated biosynthetic genes, we did not observe corresponding relative increases in glucose  or xylose  content per unit mass . there may not be a direct relationship between cesa expression and cellulose content, as evidenced when snd <dig> is overexpressed  <cit> . however, we found that mannose and rhamnose content of stems were significantly increased in snd2-ov by  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . the increase in mannose could be explained by the upregulation of csla <dig> , since csla proteins encode β-mannan synthases  <cit> . rhamnose and mannose were also reported to be increased due to snd <dig> overexpression  <cit> .

although we found no effect on fibre scw thickness in homozygous snd2-ov lines a and b, the fibre scw thickness of line c was significantly and reproducibly decreased relative to wild type . because line c exhibited the highest snd <dig> transcript abundance amongst the homozygous lines , we confirmed using several t <dig> snd2-overexpressing lines, with snd <dig> transcript far exceeding that of snd2-ov, that strong snd <dig> overexpression reduces fibre scw thickness . this phenotype resembles the dominant repression phenotype of snd <dig>  rather than the overexpression phenotype, reported previously  <cit> . however, due to the stable expression of snd <dig> transcript in all transgenic lines , this cannot be explained by co-suppression. interestingly, a similar paradox has been observed for snd <dig> overexpression  <cit> , where excess levels of this transcriptional activator were reported to have an indirect repressive effect. we suggest that this phenomenon could be attributed to gene dosage effects, where a stoichiometric increase in one tf protein leads to a decreased molar yield of a multi-protein complex, and greater yield of incomplete intermediates . such a phenomenon could also explain the observation that cesa <dig> upregulation was restricted to the most moderate snd2-overexpressing line, snd2-ov. notably, the transgenic lines in our study expressed snd <dig> at least an order of magnitude greater than the ~16-fold expression levels reported for lines with increased fibre wall thickness by zhong et al.  <cit> . this is likely due to a double, rather than a single, camv 35s promoter in the pmdc <dig> vector driving snd <dig> overexpression in this study. because we failed to identify snd2-ov lines with snd <dig> abundance near the range of 16-fold, we cannot preclude that limited snd <dig> overexpression may increase fibre scw thickness.

interestingly, when we overexpressed arabidopsis snd <dig> in eucalyptus xylem , we observed a phenotype in better agreement with that previously reported for arabidopsis  <cit> . snd <dig> overexpression in eucalyptus significantly increased fibre cell area, likely due to increased cell wall area . because our assessment of snd <dig> overexpression in multiple independent events in both arabidopsis and eucalyptus contrast not only with each other but also with that of zhong et al.  <cit> , our results suggest that the phenotypic effects of snd <dig> gain-of-function mutagenesis are intrinsically variable. the positive effect of snd <dig> overexpression on eucalyptus fibre development could be the result of a greater tolerance in eucalyptus to high-abundance snd <dig> and/or snd <dig> co-regulator levels in woody xylem, since more carbon is allocated to scw biosynthesis in eucalyptus than in arabidopsis. alternatively, snd <dig> transcript levels remained moderate in eucalyptus, a possibility that cannot be explored using the induced somatic sector analysis technique.

in addition to the requirement of the appropriate level of snd <dig> abundance in arabidopsis, spatial and temporal expression of a co-regulator is a further requirement. the fibre-restricted scw phenotype of snd <dig> overexpression observed in arabidopsis by zhong et al.  <cit>  illustrates the requirement of a spatially regulated co-regulator for snd <dig> to activate its targets, which is presumably also expressed in fibres. our results support this observation. due to the fact that none of the genes differentially expressed at eight weeks  were differentially expressed in four week stems , we further suggest that the co-regulator is temporally regulated, and that the temporal regulation of the co-regulator may be a limiting factor that constrains the ability of snd <dig> to activate its native target genes at four weeks.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that snd <dig> regulates genes involved in cellulose, mannan, and xylan biosynthesis, cell wall modification, and lignin polymerization, but not monolignol biosynthesis. snd <dig> also promotes upregulation of a relatively small number of tfs, amongst them myb <dig> and snd <dig>  we implicate snd <dig> in the unexpected regulation of the machinery of a signal transduction pathway proposed for scw development  <cit>  and propose a model in which snd <dig> occupies a subordinate but central position in the transcriptional regulatory network , with possible indirect positive feedback to higher regulators and signalling pathways. our data support the role of snd <dig> in fibre scw transcriptional regulation, but our study suggests that, at excessive levels of overexpression, snd <dig> has a negative effect on if scw deposition. this phenomenon requires further investigation. we postulate that snd <dig> overexpression could increase scw deposition within a limited range of overexpression, relying in part on the abundance of additional regulator proteins. however, we show that snd <dig> overexpression has the potential to enhance fibre development in eucalyptus trees, an important commercial forestry crop.
