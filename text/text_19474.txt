BACKGROUND
currently, reverse genetics-based tools have been largely employed to obtain biological information on genes of unknown function. nowadays genomic sequence data are easily obtained, but gene function is not always obviously extracted from these data. these tools have been used for many purposes, such as protein subcellular localization  <cit> , protein interaction identification  <cit> , protein overexpression  <cit> , gene knockout  <cit>  and gene silencing  <cit> . these techniques are particularly important in the study of trypanosomatid protozoa. sexual reproduction, although not frequent, may play a role in the heterogeneity of several trypanosomatid species. however, these parasites mostly have a clonal population structure  <cit> . this characteristic precludes the use of forward genetics to study gene function in these parasites. in addition, their protein-coding genes are transcribed in polycistronic mrnas, not related to bacterial operons, which are further processed to mature monocistronic mrnas by a trans-splicing mechanism  <cit> . this process results in a short nucleotide sequence  being added to the 5' end of trypanosomatid mrnas  <cit> . the same machinery probably scans the intergenic region  to process the upstream transcript and add the poly-a tail  <cit> . however, no consensus sequence for poly-a tail addition has been found in trypanosomes. furthermore, gene expression in these microorganisms is mostly controlled by post-transcriptional events involving rna processing and stability  <cit> . hence, to be expressed in trypanosomatids, transgenes need to be flanked by intergenic regions that contain sequence elements promoting miniexon and poly-a tail addition.

generally, irs in trypanosomatid plasmid vectors are derived from constitutively expressed genes, such as those encoding glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  <cit> , actin, aldolase  <cit> , α-tubulin  <cit>  or ubiquitin  <cit> . gene expression in trypanosomatids appears to be ubiquitous and is not dependent on the presence of a typical rna polymerase ii  promoter  <cit> . although typical pol ii promoters have not been found in trypanosomatids, it has been shown that pol ii transcription of an entire polycistronic unit initiates upstream of the first gene of the polycistron   <cit> . to enhance gene expression, vectors for use in trypanosomatids were constructed to ensure that transcription is directed by strong promoters like rna polymerase i  promoters  <cit> . some vectors were also designed to control gene expression, by combining t <dig> or pol i promoters with tetracycline-inducible systems  <cit> . these features require the development of reverse genetics strategies to deal with trypanosomatid biology.

there are a few examples of vectors designed for use in t. cruzi, mostly having conventional multiple cloning sites. traditional molecular cloning methods, based on digestion by restriction enzymes and ligation by t <dig> dna ligase, present various difficulties, such as low efficiency, limited number of sites for digestion and low adaptability for subcloning. furthermore, other limitations have been observed in these plasmids, such as low flexibility to the exchange of elements like promoters, antibiotic resistance markers, fusion tags and irs. these limitations become more evident during high-throughput procedures, where there is a need to adapt vectors, such that newly developed tags, alternate irs and different resistance markers can be used. taken together, these features reinforce the importance of producing reverse genetics tools, allowing quick and flexible strategies to better understand the biology of t. cruzi.

recently, more efficient systems have been developed to circumvent some of the traditional cloning limitations. two homologous recombination cloning systems, gap repair and the in-fusion™ pcr cloning kit , have been used in high-throughput projects  <cit> . other systems using site-specific recombination instead of homologous recombination, like the creator™ dna cloning kit , gateway® technology  and the univector plasmid-fusion system  <cit> , are other options. the use of cloning systems based on recombination instead of classic cloning techniques has improved the cloning process, making high-throughput projects less laborious.

the creator and univector cloning systems use cre-loxp recombination  <cit> , based on the recombination properties of bacteriophage p <dig>  gateway® technology uses a distinct strategy, which is based on the recombinational properties of bacteriophage lambda  <cit> . such site-specific recombination-based systems increase cloning efficiency and significantly decrease time spent on the work-bench. all site-specific recombination cloning systems present high cloning efficiencies, and the choice of system must take into account the features of each project.

gateway technology has been recently employed to create vectors for gene knockout  <cit>  and protein subcellular localization  <cit>  in t. cruzi. we developed a set of destination vectors employing gateway technology for use in reverse genetics. we validated our strategy using genes previously characterized in the literature through protein complex purification, and protein subcellular localization and co-localization techniques in t. cruzi.

RESULTS
validation of vectors
we constructed a high throughput reverse genetics platform that can be easily modified for use in various trypanosomatid species. the platform represents a set of vectors based on gateway technology-associated site-specific recombination cloning. the expression vectors were initially prepared for use in trypanosoma cruzi, due to particular characteristics of this parasite, such as rnai absence. we used a general designation, ptcgw, to describe the vectors; the specific designation of each vector was based on the tag and the resistance marker they carry . accordingly, the vectors ptcgfpn, ptccfpn and ptcyfpn, carry the tags for green, cyan and yellow fluorescent protein, respectively. the plasmids ptc6hn, ptcmycn and ptctapn carry the tags for hexahistidine, c-myc epitope and tandem affinity purification, respectively. all of these plasmids contain the gene encoding neomycin resistance . correspondingly, ptcgfph carries the gene for gfp and for hygromycin b resistance. all constructs contained intergenic regions from the t. cruzi ubiquitin locus   <cit> . the choice of tcuir was based on:  its short size ;  its use in another plasmid vector for t. cruzi  <cit> ; and  due to the participation of ubiquitin in many cellular processes, possibly during all the life cycle stages of t. cruzi, tcuir may enable the use of vectors in different life cycle stages of t. cruzi . vector constructs were verified using five t. cruzi genes, including those encoding the ribosomal protein l <dig> , the α <dig> 20s proteasome subunit , the paraflagellar component par  <dig>  a putative centrin and the small gtpase rab <dig> . the genes were inserted into ptcgfpn, ptcgfph, ptccfpn, ptcmycn, ptc6hn, and ptctapn. the clones obtained were named tapneo-tcrl <dig> , tapneo-tcpr29a , gfpneo-par <dig> , mycneo-centrin , 6hneo-centrin , gfphyg-par <dig> , gfpneo-rab <dig> , and cfpneo-rab <dig> . as a control, we used ptcgfpn and ptctapn vectors, in which a previously inserted gene  was removed while preserving the attb recombination sites present in all clones. these controls were named gfpneo-ctrl and tapneo-ctrl.

all constructs and clones obtained in this study were verified by dna sequencing and no mutations were observed. the sequences were submitted to genbank .

dna analysis of transfected t. cruzi cells
southern blot assays were performed to analyze whether plasmid vectors were present as episomal or integrative forms after t. cruzi transfection. genomic dna from wild type t. cruzi and from cells transfected with tapneo-tcpr29a were digested with hindiii endonuclease, which rendered the linear plasmid. the neomycin resistance marker  and the tandem affinity purification tag  were amplified by pcr and used as probes to detect the presence of the vector. no band representing the linear plasmid  was observed . instead, the pattern obtained in figure  <dig> shows the presence of one band, which is greater in size than the linear plasmid, suggesting that the regions represented by the probes were integrated into the t. cruzi genome.

this result was not surprising, as plasmid integration into the ribosomal locus has previously been shown in other constructs in which a ribosomal promoter was used  <cit> . besides, there is also the possibility that the vectors were integrated into other areas of the t. cruzi genome, such as the ubiquitin locus, as the irs  for this locus were present in three copies in our constructs.

analysis of mrna levels
to analyze mrna levels for the gfp-fused recombinant protein in t. cruzi transfected with gfpneo-ctrl, gfpneo-rab <dig> or gfpneo-par <dig>  we performed real-time rt-pcr using oligonucleotides to amplify gfp. gfpneo-ctrl mrna levels were approximately nine-fold higher than those of gfpneo-rab <dig> and were six-fold higher than those of gfpneo-par <dig> . to better understand cell resistance without fluorescence, we quantified neo mrna levels in the same populations for which gfp mrna levels were analyzed. levels of neo mrna were greater than gfp mrna in gfpneo-rab7-transfected t. cruzi . differences occurred despite all vectors containing a similar structure . also, although gfp-fused mrnas are distinct, this is not the case for neo mrnas. this is an interesting point that still needs to be addressed.

detection of recombinant proteins and facs analysis of transfected t. cruzi
to confirm the presence of recombinant proteins in transfected t. cruzi, western blot assays were performed using antibodies against the tags. the bands in figure 3b correspond to the expected molecular weight of the par  <dig> and tcrab <dig> with addition of the gfp tag and the sequence for the attb <dig> site. detection of tcrl <dig> and tcpr29a recombinant proteins  is shown in the "tandem affinity purification" section, while the centrin recombinant protein used with c-myc and polyhistidine tags  are shown in additional file  <dig> - figure s <dig>  predicted molecular weight of native proteins tcrl <dig>  tcpr29a, par  <dig>  centrin and tcrab <dig>  including the protein tags are described in additional file  <dig> - table s <dig> 

t. cruzi transfected with gfp constructs were analyzed by cytometry, to verify the level of fluorescence in cells transfected with gfpneo-ctrl, gfpneo-rab <dig> and gfpneo-par <dig> . cells transfected with gfpneo-ctrl had the highest percentage of fluorescent cells , followed by gfpneo-rab <dig>  and gfpneo-par <dig> . fluorescence levels were correlated with protein intensity in western blots .

to verify whether the amount of dna used for transfection influenced the percentage of fluorescent cells, we analysed fluorescence in three cultures transfected with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μg of the gfpneo-rab <dig> clone. no fluorescence was detected by cytometry in any culture  <dig> h after transfection . the fact that no fluorescence was detected in any of the transient assays may be explained by the integrative nature of our vectors. episomal forms of an integrative vector are rapidly degraded after transfection  <cit> . however, after selecting for antibiotic-resistance in cells transfected with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μg of the gfpneo-rab <dig> plasmids, fluorescent cells were detected, but there was no correlation between the amount of dna and fluorescence levels . thus,  <dig> μg of dna appeared to be enough for transfections using the system described here.

subcellular localization of recombinant proteins
we selected genes whose subcellular localization is well known in epimastigotes. the small gtpase tcrab <dig> located in the anterior region of epimastigote cells at the golgi cisternae, which appear in close proximity to the kinetoplast, basal bodies and flagellar pocket  <cit> . par  <dig> is a component of the t. cruzi paraflagellar rod located at the epimastigote flagellum  <cit> . we obtained identical localizations to those previously reported for both tcrab <dig> and par  <dig>  using gfp and cfp fusions . gfpneo-ctrl was used as a control and showed a distribution pattern which was different from that for gfp-fused recombinant proteins. although gfpneo-rab <dig> was mostly located in the golgi region, there was a signal in the cytoplasm, next to the nucleus. this may have been due to the overproduction of gfpneo-rab <dig>  t. cruzi transfected with both tcrab <dig> and par  <dig> in the same group of cells were also analyzed by fluorescence microscope. in this experiment, tcrab <dig> and par  <dig> were expressed from ptccfpn and ptcgfph, respectively. the results demonstrated the feasibility of protein co-localization in t. cruzi cells during a single transfection experiment using ptcgw vectors . there was also no correlation between fluorescence intensity  and cytometry analysis data . this absence of correlation was possibly caused by differences in exposure times and contrast . indeed, we obtained the subcellular localization of a putative centrin of t. cruzi using the vector ptcmycn . this protein is related to centrosome and was located in epimastigotes near to kinetoplast in agreement with personal communication .

fluorescent proteins have been employed for subcellular localization in several types of organisms. this approach has some advantages: it is rapid and avoids the use of antibodies. however, in some cases, this technique may result in protein misallocation, due to at least two factors:  overexpression of recombinant proteins  <cit> ; and  interference of n- or c-terminal fusions with the localization signals  <cit> . to circumvent these problems, the platform described here was conceived for use with various strategies. first, recombinant vectors can be used without the pol i promoter, which may diminish expression of recombinant proteins.

moreover, the irs might be promoting different gene expression levels with the constructs in this study; thus, each ir could then be replaced by a non regulated or regulated ir, enabling standardized levels of expression or life cycle-specific expression, respectively.

our group is currently employing deep sequence and proteomic analysis to select specific intergenic regions for use in ptcgw vectors. also, the analysis of gene sequences to detect particular localization signals may help to choose between n- or c-terminal fusions. the constructs in this study were designed for n-terminal fusions, but they can be modified quickly to generate c-terminal tags.

tandem affinity purification
the tandem affinity purification  tag  <cit>  comprises two repeated b domain of protein a , plus the site for tev protease and the calmodulin binding peptide . the main reason for using a tandem purification approach is to avoid false positives. two genes already described in the literature, tcpr29a  <cit>  and tcrl <dig>  <cit>  were inserted into ptctapn. tcrl <dig> encodes the l <dig> protein, a member of the larger ribosomal subunit, and tcpr29a  is a gene encoding the α <dig> 20s proteasome subunit. the tap tag-fused l <dig>  29a and the control tapneo-ctrl  were detected by western blot with anti-cbp antibody .

a standard tap procedure was followed to check the efficiency of both purification steps. the l <dig> resulting fractions were probed with anti-cbp antibody revealing an inefficient binding of the protein complex to the calmodulin column , as the tap tag fused l <dig> protein was neither detected after the calmodulin column elution nor at the calmodulin beads . the low efficiency of protein recovery using cbp tag has been reported by other groups working with trypanosomatids  <cit> .

based on the partial success of the tags, all further tests were only performed up to the tev digestion step . the protein complex purification of t. cruzi transfected with tapneo-tcrl <dig>  tapneo-tcpr29a and tapneo-ctrl was performed using only the igg column. to better evaluate this technique we used antibodies against other members of protein complexes probed. for the l <dig> ribosome enriched fraction we used antibody against l <dig> protein. the 29a proteasome-enriched fraction was probed with anti-α <dig> protein antibody. antibodies against l <dig> and α <dig> were used in the same membrane for l <dig>  29a and ctrl complexes purification to make clear that the enrichment of the respective partners occurred just as a result of a protein-protein interaction and not as non-specific binding. l <dig> was only enriched during the l <dig> complex purification . the same specificity was observed in the 29a purification, where α <dig> was exclusively detected . moreover, an absence of l <dig> and α <dig> during tapneo-ctrl  purification indicated that the newly expressed sequences were not generating nonspecific binding sites to l <dig> and α <dig> proteins . due to inefficiency of cbp tag column, we are currently testing other affinity tags, as a second step for tandem affinity purifications.

general features of ptcgw vectors
we constructed destination plasmid vectors with several n-terminal tags. the tap, c-myc, polyhistidine, cyan and green fluorescent protein tags were successfully validated earlier in this study. these vectors have attachment sites for gateway recombination, providing several advantages over classic cloning, such as increases in speed and efficiency during the cloning step. moreover, this platform allows orf transference to destination vectors with distinct applications, providing different insights into protein function. the gateway platform has also had a significant impact on gene characterization in large-scale projects; for example: when a collection of orfs has been available in compatible plasmids  <cit> .

another interesting feature was achieved during the design of vectors; we selected several one-cut restriction endonuclease sites to insert the elements, with the exception of xhoi whose sites flank the antibiotic resistance marker. this provides the flexibility to exchange all the elements in these vectors, such as promoter, intergenic regions , tags and antibiotic resistance genes. a good example of this flexibility was the set of experiments performed with the co-localization vector. this flexibility is important for further developments of this platform. some of these developments have already been defined: first, there is evidence of intra-species ribosomal promoter specificity in t. cruzi  <cit> . hence, we designed constructs allowing the exchange of the t. cruzi i ribosomal promoter with other promoters, such as the t. cruzi ii ribosomal promoter, seeking to expand the use of ptcgw vectors in other t. cruzi strains. second, irs are the other exchangeable elements in ptcgw vectors. several studies have shown that untranslated regions affect the level of expression of reporter genes in trypanosomatids  <cit> . the vectors described here allow ir exchange, thus modifying mrna stability in attempts to modify the gene expression profiles in specific situations, for example during specific stages of the t. cruzi life cycle.

finally, we followed a protocol for transfection that minimizes the amount of dna and medium used. thus, we obtained transfectants using dna from a unique plasmid minipreparation. moreover, our protocol also minimizes the amount of media and antibiotics used for cell cultivation, thus decreasing the cost and time-scale of large projects. our procedure can be improved further, increasing its efficiency for use in high-throughput projects. taken together, these observations demonstrate that our vector platform represents a powerful system for gene characterization in t. cruzi.

CONCLUSIONS
due to an absence of vectors combining a high-throughput cloning system and flexibility for exchanging its elements in t. cruzi, we developed and constructed destination vectors incorporating these features. our ptcgw vectors can be used for protein subcellular localization, co-localization and complex purification. these constructs can also be customized. in addition, we standardized some of our protocols, simplifying the use of our platform in large-scale projects. this is a very important step towards improving available methodologies for the characterization of thousands of genes whose functions remain unknown in t. cruzi.
