BACKGROUND
the role of cholesterol in embryonic development is an important question in biology, with significant ramifications for human disease  <cit> . defects in post-squalene cholesterol biosynthesis, such as in smith-lemli-opitz syndrome  or desmosterolosis , disrupt the synthesis of cholesterol and cause a variety of severe developmental abnormalities  <cit> . slos is a complex inborn error of cholesterol biosynthesis caused by mutations of the 3β-hydroxysterol-Δ <dig> reductase gene   <cit> . the lack of dhcr <dig> expression in mouse mimics the early postnatal lethality observed in severely affected individuals . the biological changes in development caused by disruption of normal cholesterol biosynthesis that result in this early postnatal lethality remain obscure. as a genetic model for understanding of the slos in human, mice lacking dhcr <dig> provide a useful model to determine which affected tissues are critically responsible for the lethality and which ones may contribute to the morbidity.

one cause of early postnatal death in the dhcr <dig> null animals appears to be associated with anoxia due to diffuse atelectasis of the late gestational lungs  <cit> , which may cause immature formation of gas-exchange unit and subsequent respiratory insufficiency after birth  <cit> . therefore, lung involvement seems to be a cause of neonatal death in dhcr <dig> null mouse model. however, there is still uncertainty regarding the mechanism responsible for the late gestational lung hypoplasia caused by the loss of endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis in dhcr7-/- mice. as with any biological aspect of a generalized cholesterol deficiency, the pathophysiology is likely to be complex and multi-factorial. it remains unclear whether the delayed lung maturation is caused by a developmental defect intrinsic to lung or whether it represents a systemic abnormality, especially of the central nervous system , because of impaired cholesterol homeostasis during embryogenesis. a different variety of developmental abnormalities in brain have also been noted in both human patients and, to some extent, in dhcr7-deficient animal models. in this regard, we have also recently demonstrated that dhcr7-/- mice can be partially rescued from neonatal death by a low level restoration of dhcr <dig> expression in brain, indicating that neuropathophysiology is one cause of their neonatal lethality  <cit> .

in attempting to rescue dhcr7-deficient mice, we felt that it was necessary to consider the liver because that organ is a major source of cholesterol for most developing organs, except for brain  <cit> . thus, we hypothesized that restoration of normal cholesterol synthesis in the liver might be able to abrogate the lethality. in the current study, we asked whether the specific reconstitution of dhcr <dig> expression in liver would alleviate the cholesterol deficiency and afford protection from early postnatal death in dhcr <dig> null mice. our results suggest that, although expression of dhcr <dig> in liver alone during development induced a significant improvement in cholesterol homeostasis in non-brain tissues and promoted lung maturation, it failed to rescue the neonatal lethality. these results provided further evidence that cns defects caused by dhcr <dig> null likely play a major role in the lethal pathogenesis of dhcr7-/- mice, with the peripheral organs contributing the morbidity.

RESULTS
characterization of tgdhcr <dig> lines
three mice , referred as to tgdhcr7- <dig>  tgdhcr7- <dig> and tgdhcr7- <dig>  respectively , were identified as transgenic on the basis of pcr and southern blot analyses of tail samples of genomic dna. multiple tissues were collected from n <dig> transgenic progeny from the founder mice crossed with c57bl/6j at postnatal day   <dig> and analyzed for transgene expression by rt-pcr and immunoblotting. both tgdhcr7- <dig> and tgdhcr7- <dig> transgenic lines expressed human dhcr <dig> mrna robustly in the postnatal livers, but not in the other tissues  and western blotting analyses showed expression of ha-tagged protein . tgdhcr <dig> mrna transcript was detected in transgenic liver at e <dig>   by rt-pcr determination  and was quantitatively ~ <dig> fold higher than endogenous murine dhcr <dig> mrna in the transgenic liver at e <dig>  as judged by real-time pcr . immunofluorescence staining with anti-ha antibody showed that tgdhcr <dig> was highly expressed in hepatocytes in liver sections, but such signal was not detectable in control liver . further studies therefore utilized these two lines, which were backcrossed with c57bl/6j for  <dig> to  <dig> generations. since no differences between either line were identified, these lines were used interchangeably.

sterol metabolic profile of tgdhcr7/dhcr7-/- mice
to determine the physiological consequences of selective restoration of dhcr <dig> expression in liver, we bred the transgene onto dhcr <dig> null background . steady-state sterol levels in p0-p <dig> neonates were obtained by sacrificing the litters from the initial crosses, tissues and plasma harvested and genotypes performed on dna extracted from tails. cholesterol levels in dhcr7-/-tg+ plasma  were significantly improved compared to non-transgenic dhcr7-null plasma , plasma 7-dehydrocholesterol  and 8-dehydrocholesterol  sterols were reduced and the percentage precursor levels significantly decreased . thus the expression of the transgene in the liver led to improvements in the plasma sterol profiles.

liver sterol profiles in dhcr7-/-tg+ pups showed that tissue cholesterol was restored to almost wild-type liver level and precursor levels were reduced by ~70% suggesting the liver defect was not fully restored . it is important to note that whole liver tissue in the embryonic and neonatal mouse also contains substantial non-hepatic  cells.

remarkably, tissue sterol levels in dhcr7-/-tg+ lung also showed a dramatic restoration of cholesterol . precursor sterol profiles were also significantly improved, and were similar in profile to that observed for the liver , though the reductions were more modest . in contrast, there was almost no change in the sterol profiles in brain from knockout animals that expressed the transgene in the liver . although cholesterol levels in dhcr7-/-tg+ brains were statistically higher than non-transgenic mutant brains , this increase was minimal and the brains showed significant cholesterol deficiency. additionally, the presence of the transgene had no effect on either the total 7/8dhc precursors  or the different species of precursors . we speculate that the small increase in brain cholesterol seen in the dhcr7-/-tg+ may reflect the contamination of the brain by the increased cholesterol in the blood.

collectively, these data indicated that selective reconstitution of dhcr <dig> expression in liver improved significantly cholesterol homeostasis in liver, lung and circulation of dhcr <dig> null animals during embryogenesis, but did not affect metabolism in the brain.

late gestational lung development in dhcr7-/-tg+ mice
loss of dhcr <dig> in mice leads to subtle, but reproducible defects in lung development; all knockout pups show impaired saccular and capillary growth development caused by developmental arrest at the very last stages of lung development  <cit> . the primary cell defect seems to be a failure of terminal differentiation of type  <dig> alveolar epithelial cells . since the hepatic transgene expression led to an increase in significant amounts of lung tissue cholesterol, we examined for effects on lung phenotype in near term embryos  that were wild-type , dhcr7-/-tg+ and dhcr7-/-tg-. at this stage, the lungs of wt mice showed normal sacculation  with formation of pre-alveoli that have thin septa . in contrast, lungs from dhcr <dig> null mice  showed the lack of saccular formation, with failure to thin out the pre-alveolar septae and development of sac spaces, in keeping with our previous findings. interestingly, the lungs from dhcr <dig> null mice expressing dhcr <dig> in the liver showed an intermediate phenotype, with improved sac space formation and thinning of the pre-alveolar septae . analyses of the sac space volumes showed that transgenic ko lungs had an increase in terminal sac spaces, compared to non-transgenic mutant lungs . immunohistochemical characterization of these lungs confirmed this histological improvement . we had previously shown abnormal t1-α, pecam- <dig> and caveolin- <dig> staining patterns in dhcr <dig> null lungs, with preserved surfactant protein staining. the transgene expression led to an improvement in all of these staining patterns , suggesting that transgenic-induced improvement of cholesterol homeostasis in non-brain tissues normalized the architecture of the distal lung sacculation.

postnatal survivability of dhcr7-/-tg+ mice
since all of the dhcr <dig> null pups die within  <dig> h of birth , we wished to see if the improvement in the cholesterol by liver transgene expression improved survival. one hundred and ninety-six pups from dhcr7+/-tg+ females bred with dhcr7+/-tg+ males were scored for viability. the survival rates, defined as pups remaining alive beyond  <dig> h after birth, are summarized in table  <dig>  when observed at birth, in general, pups that appeared bluish, hypotonic, breathed with difficulty, demonstrated no suckling activity, became dehydrated, and died within  <dig> h after birth were genotyped to be non-transgenic dhcr7-/-, all features of being dhcr <dig> null, as described previously  <cit> . of the dhcr7-/-tg+ pups that were relatively pink within minutes after being born, twelve of  <dig>  from tgdhcr <dig> line- <dig> and  <dig> of  <dig>  from tgdhcr <dig> line- <dig> survived the first postnatal day, but died within  <dig> h after birth. dhcr7-/-tg+ pups were also observed to show some hypotonia and poor suckling reflexes similar to dhcr7-/-tg- pups. the remaining pups were sacrificed after  <dig> days to confirm that none of the survivors to this point were null for dhcr <dig>  therefore, liver-specific restoration of cholesterol biosynthesis improved survival to up to  <dig> hours, but all dhcr <dig> null pups still died. thus, despite the hepatic, blood and non-brain tissue cholesterol and developmental improvements by hepatic transgene expression, lethality was minimally delayed.

* tg positive and negative pups are included in wt and dhcr7+/- groups. **survival is defined as being alive beyond  <dig> hours after being born.

association of cholesterol and 7/8dhc with lipid membranes
participation in the formation and function of membrane lipid microdomains  is an important function of cholesterol  <cit> . to address whether the transgene expression led to alterations of sterol distributions between raft and non-raft membrane fractions, we fractionated membranes from lung tissues from these three genotypes. to isolate detergent-resistant membranes , triton x- <dig>  extracted postnuclear supernatants prepared from wild-type , dhcr7-/-tg- and dhcr7-/-tg+ neonatal lungs were differentially fractionated in discontinuous sucrose gradients  <cit>  and analyzed. figure 9a showed protein and organic-phosphate distribution in tx sucrose gradients; there were no differences between any of the genotypes. cholesterol and precursor sterols were analyzed from gradient fractions by gc-ms . in wt lungs, cholesterol was detected as the only major sterol , 7/8dhc levels were undetectable , and showed a bimodal profile, with one sharp peak corresponding to the raft fractions , the second peak found in high-density non-raft fractions , in keeping with previous reports using detergent or detergent-free methods  <cit> . in dhcr7-/-tg- lungs, sterols composed of a mixture of 7/8dhc and cholesterol, also exhibited bimodal profiles, and 7/8dhc constituted the major sterol in both raft and non-raft fractions . in dhcr7-/-tg+ lungs, although, in both raft and non-raft fractions, cholesterol was dramatically increased, considerable amount of 7/8dhc was still detected . total sterol levels  were similar in all three groups. quantitative analyses of sterol content in rafts  and non-rafts  are shown in fig. 9e and 9f, respectively. significantly increased cholesterol, ~ <dig> % of wt levels, was observed in rafts from dhcr7-/-tg+ lungs, compared to dhcr7-/-tg- lungs. however, raft cholesterol in dhcr7-/-tg+ lung was still significantly lower than that in wt lungs. raft 7/8dhc level was significantly reduced, but a considerable accumulation was evident in dhcr7-/-tg+ lungs. interestingly, although non-raft cholesterol levels in dhcr7-/-tg+ lungs were comparable to wt, there was no significant decrease of non-raft 7/8dhc levels in dhcr7-/-tg+ lungs, compared to dhcr7-/-tg- lungs. these data suggest that precursor sterols can be found in raft fractions, but that total sterol distributions appear to be similar in wt and knockout lungs.

discussion
severe cholesterol deficiency, caused by the intentional genetic ablation of dhcr <dig> in the mouse, has proven to be incompatible with perinatal life and is associated with respiratory insufficiency after birth  <cit> . however, dhcr <dig> null pups also exhibit other defects that indicate other organs/systems are also disrupted by absence of normal cholesterol synthesis. a key question is therefore which of these organs  leads to the neonatal lethality. the hypoxia and abnormal lung phenotype would suggest this could be a major defect, though it is also possible that a failure to integrate respiration at the cns level could be equally important. in our preliminary effort to restore dhcr <dig> activity in the cns, we reported a stochastic rescue of pups up to  <dig> weeks beyond birth, despite almost no increase in brain cholesterol, or fall in precursor sterol concentrations  <cit> . at the same time, we had also embarked upon restoration of cholesterol synthesis in peripheral  tissues to see if this could abrogate the lethality. we report herein the effects of restoration of cholesterol synthesis in the developing liver, an organ that can circulate lipoproteins and cholesterol at a very embryonic age.

selective reconstitution of liver cholesterol biosynthesis resulted in significant improvement of cholesterol homeostasis in all of the tissues examined in dhcr <dig> null mice with the exception of the brain, confirming the embryonic liver's ability to supply cholesterol to peripheral tissues and the inability of cholesterol in the circulation to cross the blood-brain barrier. cholesterol was detectable in liver and lung of non-transgenic dhcr7-null term pups at ~40% of normal levels, which represents maternal transfer of this cholesterol and confirmed previous findings  <cit> . cholesterol levels in both liver and lungs of transgenic dhcr7-null term pups increased to ~80% of wt level , indicating robust transgenic liver expression of dhcr <dig> led to adequate delivery of endogenously synthesized cholesterol to the lungs . the alleviation of the non-brain tissue cholesterol deficit in the transgenic dhc7-null embryos led to improvement in the lung development, but not complete restoration of normal development.

although our data support the conclusion that the lung defects may not be the major reason for the neonatal mortality, some caveats need to be mentioned. despite significantly increased cholesterol in the lung, the sterol precursors were reduced by ~40% and not completely suppressed. sterol precursors have been demonstrated to be part of plasma membranes and their presence may have significant implications in altering membrane signaling, by altering raft formation and functions  <cit> . in this study, membrane sterol distributions were further investigated and compared between transgenic and non-transgenic dhcr7-/- lungs. adapting an established method, lipid-rafts and non-rafts were prepared by sucrose gradient fractionation of triton x <dig> extracted tissue homogenates  <cit> . bimodal profiles of cholesterol and 7/8dhc in sucrose gradient fractions were found, with first peak enriched in "raft" fractions and the second peak found in non-raft fractions. thus, the bimodal profile may represent sterol portions distributed in lipid-raft microdomains and subcellular membranes  <cit> . as expected, although significant restoration of cholesterol level, a considerable amount of 7/8dhc was still accumulated in the rafts of transgenic dhcr7-/- lungs. thus one mechanistic possibility is that raft-mediated signaling may be important for the terminal differentiation of type  <dig> aecs , and that this defect was not fully complemented by increasing the uptake of cholesterol from exogenous sources and thus the lung-associated mortality was not altered. the defect in cholesterol biosynthesis in the lungs will continue to lead to generation of precursor sterols and since these sterols are readily incorporated into plasma membranes, restoration of normal raft function may require direct restoration of dhcr <dig> activity  <cit> .

another possibility is that pulmonary surfactant alteration may also play a role in the dhcr7-deficient lung phenotype, since pulmonary surfactant, the lipid-protein material that stabilizes the respiratory surface of the lung, has been described to function as lipid microdomains. however, we have reported that expression of surfactant proteins, both at the mrna and at the immunohistochemical level, was indistinguishable between dhcr7-null and wild-type embryos  <cit> . cholesterol concentration, a critical parameter in modulating the lateral structure of pulmonary surfactant membranes as evidenced by in-vitro studies, may provide a structural scaffold for surfactant proteins to act at appropriate local densities and lipid composition  <cit> . a difference in the condensing ability of cholesterol and 7dhc in monolayer films of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine , a major surfactant phospholipid, and their different abilities to form lateral domains with dppc has also been demonstrated  <cit> . sterols can induce upregulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis in cultured fibroblasts and this process is affected by the double-bond position in the sterol tetracyclic ring structure  <cit> . therefore, markedly reduced cholesterol content and the massive accumulation of precursor sterols, such as 7/8dhc, may affect lung developmental at late gestational stages by the modulation of surfactant properties, even if surfactant protein expression is normal. however, restoration of dhcr <dig> activity in the lung using a transgene that expressed dhcr <dig> activity did not rescue this lethality . additionally, our previous brain-specific dhcr <dig> transgenic expression studies showed that some rescue was possible, even though lung sterol profiles were not altered  <cit> . thus, while lung defects remain a contributory factor for this lethality, we contend that a defect in the cns is the major reason why slos pups die soon after birth.

some positive aspects should also be highlighted. since the only cells that could synthesize cholesterol were the hepatocytes in the developing liver, yet there was robust restoration of cholesterol in the peripheral organs, this further confirms previous studies on the importance of lipoprotein-mediated liver-derived cholesterol delivery to these organs  <cit> . additionally, this study also confirms the now well-established physiological observation that the blood-brain barrier is an absolute barrier for entry of pre-formed cholesterol into the brain and it is operational as early as e <dig> in the mouse  <cit> .

one curious finding confounding the above interpretations is that, although cholesterol levels in the transgenic dhcr7-null livers increased to almost wt levels, the precursor levels in the liver were reduced by only  <dig> %, despite an almost 5-fold increase in the relative expression of the transgene in the liver. our explanation for this is that the fetal and neonatal mouse liver contains more than hepatocytes, with a significant amount of hematopoetic activity that persists beyond birth. the apoe promoter chosen will only result in robust hepatic-specific expression. since total dissected organ tissue sterols are measured, we presume that the precursor accumulations are therefore primarily in these non-hepatic cells and not hepatocytes. if so, it also suggests that close proximity of the hepatocytes and hematopoetic stem cells does not result in complementation or clearance of the precursor sterols from the latter. thus, while cholesterol can be efficiently delivered to the various tissues readily via the lipoprotein-mediated pathways, removal of the precursor sterols back to the liver may not be as efficient.

CONCLUSIONS
restoration of liver cholesterol synthesis is an efficient method to restore peripheral tissue cholesterol in dhcr7-null embryos, and this can lead to an improvement in the lung developmental defects reported previously and a minimal improvement in the neonatal lethality was also observed. however, this strategy does not affect the sterol defect in the cns and this organ may be critically responsible for the neonatal lethality.
