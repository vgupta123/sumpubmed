BACKGROUND
grapevine berry ripening can be divided into three major stages  <cit> . in stage  <dig>  berry size increases sigmoidally. stage  <dig> is known as a lag phase where there is no increase in berry size. stage  <dig> is considered the ripening stage. veraison is at the beginning of the ripening stage and is characterized by the initiation of color development, softening of the berry and rapid accumulation of the hexoses, glucose and fructose. berry growth is sigmoidal in stage  <dig> and the berries double in size. many of the flavor compounds and volatile aromas are derived from the skin and synthesized at the end of this stage  <cit> .

many grape flavor compounds are produced as glycosylated, cysteinylated and glutathionylated precursors  and phenolics  <cit>  and many of the precursors of the flavor compounds are converted to various flavors by yeast during the fermentation process of wine. nevertheless, there are distinct fruit flavors and aromas that are produced and can be tasted in the fruit, many of which are derived from terpenoids, fatty acids and amino acids  <cit> .

terpenes are important compounds for distinguishing important cultivar fruit characteristics  <cit> . there are  <dig> putatively functional,  <dig> partial and  <dig> partial pseudogenes in the terpene synthase family that have been identified in the pinot noir reference genome  <cit> . terpene synthases are multi-functional enzymes using multiple substrates and producing multiple products. more than half of the putatively functional terpene synthases in the pinot noir reference genome have been functionally annotated experimentally and distinct differences have been found in some of these enzymes amongst three grape varieties: pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon and gewürztraminer  <cit> .

other aromatic compounds also contribute significant cultivar characteristics. c13-norisoprenoids are flavor compounds derived from carotenoids by the action of the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase enzymes   <cit> . cabernet sauvignon, sauvignon blanc and cabernet franc are characterized by specific volatile thiols  <cit>  and methoxypyrazines  <cit> . enzymes involved in the production of these aromas have been recently characterized  <cit> .

phenolic compounds play a central role in the physical mouthfeel properties of red wine; recent work relates quality with tannin levels  <cit> . while the grape genotype has a tremendous impact on tannin content, the environment also plays a very large role in grape composition  <cit> . the pathway for phenolic biosynthesis is well known, but the mechanisms of environmental influence are poorly understood.

ultimately, there is an interaction between molecular genetics and the environment. flavor is influenced by climate, topography and viticultural practices   <cit> . for example, water deficit alters gene expression of enzymes involved in aroma biosynthesis in grapes, which is genotype dependent, and may lead to increased levels of compounds, such as terpenes and hexyl acetate, that contribute to fruity volatile aromas  <cit> .

the grapevine berry can be subdivided into the skin, pulp and seeds  <cit> . the skin includes the outer epidermis  and inner hypodermis . a thick waxy cuticle covers the epidermis. the hypodermal cells contain chloroplasts, which lose their chlorophyll at veraison and become modified plastids  <cit> ; they are the sites of terpenoid biosynthesis and carotenoid catabolism. anthocyanins and tannins accumulate in the vacuoles of hypodermal cells  <cit> . pulp cells are the main contributors to the sugar and organic acid content of the berries  <cit> . pulp cells also have a much higher set of transcripts involved in carbohydrate metabolism, but a lower set of transcripts involved in lipid, amino acid, vitamin, nitrogen and sulfur metabolism than in the skins  <cit> .

hormones can influence berry development and ripening. concentrations of auxin, cytokinins and gibberellins tend to increase in early fruit development of the first stage  <cit> . at veraison, these hormone concentrations have declined concomitant with a peak in abscisic acid concentration just before veraison. auxin prolongs the stage  <dig> lag phase  <cit>  and inhibits anthocyanin biosynthesis and color development in stage  <dig>  <cit> .

grapevine, a nonclimacteric fruit, is not very sensitive to ethylene; however, ethylene appears to be necessary for normal fruit ripening  <cit> . ethylene concentration is highest at anthesis, but declines to low levels upon fruit set; ethylene concentrations rise slightly thereafter and peak just before veraison then decline to low levels by maturity  <cit> . ethylene also plays a role in the ripening of another nonclimacteric fruit, strawberry  <cit> . aba also appears to be important in grape berry ripening during veraison when aba concentrations increase resulting in increased expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and anthocyanin accumulation in the skin  <cit> . aba induces abf <dig>  a transcription factor  that affects berry ripening by stimulating berry softening and phenylpropanoid accumulation  <cit> . in addition, aba affects sugar accumulation in ripening berries by stimulating acid invertase activity  <cit>  and the induction of sugar transporters  <cit> . it is not clear whether aba directly affects flavor volatiles , but there could be indirect effects due to competition for common precursors in the carotenoid pathway.

many grape berry ripening studies have focused on targeted sampling over a broad range of berry development stages, but generally with an emphasis around veraison, when berry ripening is considered to begin. in this study, a narrower focus is taken on the late ripening stages where many berry flavors are known to develop in the skin. we show that that the abundance of transcripts involved in ethylene signaling is increased along with those associated with terpenoid and fatty acid metabolism, particularly in the skin.

RESULTS
the transcript abundance of a large number of genes was statistically significantly changed across °brix levels and berry tissues
cabernet sauvignon clusters were harvested in  <dig> from a commercial vineyard in paso robles, california at various times after veraison with a focus on targeting °brix levels near maturity. dates and metabolic details that establish the developmental state of the berries at each harvest are presented in additional file  <dig>  berries advanced by harvest date with the typical developmental changes for cabernet sauvignon: decreases in titratable acidity and 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine  concentrations and increases in sugar  and color .

transcriptomic analysis focused on four harvest dates having average cluster °brix levels of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . wines made in an earlier study from grapes harvested at comparable levels of sugars or total soluble solids to those in the present study showed clear sensory differences  <cit> . six biological replicates, comprising two clusters each, were separated into skins and pulp in preparation for rna extraction and transcriptomic analysis using the nimblegen grape whole-genome microarray. thus, a 4 ×  <dig> factorial  experimental design was established. after standard microarray processing and data normalization, two-way anova indicated that the transcript abundance of  <dig>  transcripts statistically significantly changed across the °brix levels below the adjusted p-value  of  <dig>  , the transcript abundance of  <dig>  transcripts changed significantly across tissue types, and the abundance of  <dig> transcripts changed significantly with respect to the °brix x tissue interaction term  p-value column: adjbrix, adjtissue or adjtissue*brix).

a note of caution must be added here. there are high similarities amongst members in certain vitis gene families , making it very likely that cross-hybridization can occur with probes on the microarray with high similarity to other genes. we estimate approximately  <dig>  genes have the potential for cross-hybridization, with at least one probe of a set of four unique probes for that gene on the microarray potentially cross-hybridizing with probes for another gene on the microarray. genes with the potential for cross-hybridization have been identified and are highlighted in light red in additional file  <dig>  the rationale to include them is that although individual genes can not be uniquely separated, the probe sets can identify a gene and its highly similar gene family members, thus, providing some useful information about the biological responses of the plant. an additional approach was taken, removing cross-hybridizing probes before quantitative data analysis . many of the significant genes were unaffected by this processing, but  <dig> genes  were completely removed from the analysis. thus, it was felt that valuable information was lost using such a stringent approach. the less stringent approach allowing for analysis of genes with potential cross-hybridization was used here in the rest of the analyses.

to assess the main processes affected by these treatments, the gene ontologies  of significantly affected transcripts were analyzed for statistical significance  using bingo  <cit> . based on transcripts that had significant changes in abundance with °brix level,  <dig> biological processes were significantly overrepresented in this group . the three top overrepresented processes were response to abiotic stress, biosynthetic process, and response to chemical stimulus, a rather generic set of categories. tissue differences were more revealing at the stage when flavors peak;  <dig> transcripts that were significantly higher in skins compared to pulp at  <dig>  °brix  were tested for overrepresented go functional categories . some of the top go categories included photosynthesis, isoprenoid biosynthesis, and pigment biosynthesis . some of the transcripts with the largest differences between skin and pulp at  <dig>  °brix are β-ketoacyl-coa synthase , taxane 10-β-hydroxylase , wax synthase, a lipase, an abc transporter, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  .figure  <dig>

the abundance of  <dig> transcripts was significantly higher in pulp than skin at  <dig>  °brix . some of the top go categories overrepresented were a variety of transport processes  and small gtpase mediated signal transduction . some of the transcripts with the largest differences in abundance with pulp greater than skin at  <dig>  °brix were polygalacturonase , flavonol synthase, stachyose synthase, an amino acid transporter, a potassium channel , and hre <dig>  .figure  <dig> 
some representative examples of transcripts with higher abundance in the pulp compared to the skin at  <dig>  °brix. data are means ± se; n =  <dig> 



the transcript abundance of  <dig> genes had significantly differential expression across °brix levels and tissues . the top go categories overrepresented in this set involved photosynthesis and phenylpropanoid metabolism, both associated with the berry skin . other flavor-centric categories of the  <dig> categories overrepresented include aromatic compound biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism and alcohol catabolism.

this transcript set was further analyzed by dividing into  <dig> clusters using k-means clustering . the overrepresented go categories were determined for each cluster . eight of the  <dig> clusters had distinct overrepresented go categories; two clusters did not have any overrepresented go categories, meaning that the genes in these two clusters were assigned to go categories of expected proportions when compared to the entire nimblegen array. clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had a large number of overrepresented categories. many go categories within a cluster are subsets of others in that cluster and were grouped together. for example, cluster  <dig> had four overrepresented go categories, oxygen transport, gas transport, heat acclimation and response to heat. the four categories could be grouped into two, as two are subsets of the others; this is how they were listed in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

induction of transcripts of vvierf tfs, ethylene signaling and aroma enzymes
it would be impossible to discuss here all the transcript abundance changes detected in these berries. as we were interested in compounds associated with berry flavors as they develop or change in the late stages of berry ripening, we took a more targeted approach for analysis with this in mind. berries at 24° brix are known to be near-optimal for flavor  <cit> , thus we took a simple approach to look for genes that were peaking around this stage. we found some significant and large increases in transcript abundance between the  <dig>  and  <dig>  °brix levels. a group of vvierf <dig> transcription factor  paralogs represented  <dig> of the top  <dig> transcripts increasing in transcript abundance from  <dig>  to  <dig>  °brix in the skin, but not in the pulp . these vvierf <dig> tfs were also found in cluster  <dig> . this is very interesting since many flavor compounds are derived from the skin and erf tfs are known to be responsive to ethylene, a known fruit-ripening hormone  <cit> .

these vvierf tfs were named erf <dig> in the annotation by grimplet et al.  <cit>  , however they are more orthologous with aterf <dig> as determined by a more comprehensive phylogenetic method using many plant species at gramene . annotation details of the v <dig> gene models of the vviap2/erf superfamily can be found in additional file  <dig> including updated vvi symbols according to its closest arabidopsis ortholog as instructed by the grapevine gene nomenclature system developed by the international grape genome program  supernomenclature committee  <cit> . this renaming of the ap2/erf superfamily should facilitate comparative analyses and functions with other species, particularly arabidopsis.

to properly annotate the ap2/erf superfamily of vitis vinifera according to the iggp supernomenclature committee instructions, a phylogenetic tree was generated for the ap2/erf superfamily of arabidopsis thaliana and vitis vinifera using the tair  <dig> and v <dig> gene models, respectively . the labeled family classifications were derived from the arabidopsis naming scheme by nakano et al.  <cit> . there are  <dig> members in the vitis ap2/erf superfamily in the pinot noir reference genome. however, the six paralogs of erf <dig> discussed above belong to a vitis vinifera clade  in subfamily ix  and are distinctly different or separate from any arabidopsis subfamily ix erf tfs . all of these tfs in this clade are orthologs of aterf <dig> 

vvierf6l <dig>  had one of the most interesting profiles of the  <dig> members of this clade because its transcript abundance peaked at  <dig>  °brix . using k-means clustering, vvierf6l <dig> fell within cluster  <dig>  with  <dig> transcripts, including five additional vvierf <dig> paralogs. the top go categories associated with cluster  <dig> were genes associated with terpenoid metabolism and pigment biosynthesis . other interesting flavor associated categories included fatty acid and alcohol metabolism . representative transcripts from cluster  <dig> that were correlated with the transcript abundance profile of vvierf6l <dig> can be seen in figure  <dig>  these are acc oxidase, which is involved in ethylene biosynthesis; a lipoxygenase, part of a fatty acid degradation pathway giving rise to flavor alcohols such as hexenol; α-expansin  <dig>  a cell wall loosening enzyme involved in fruit softening, and two terpene synthases, which produce important terpenes that contribute to cabernet sauvignon flavor and aroma. the high similarity of these transcript profiles indicates that ethylene biosynthesis and signaling may be involved in the production of grape aroma. supporting this argument, two recent studies  <cit>  have shown that a tomato erf tf , falling in the same erf ix subfamily, has a strong effect on ethylene signaling and fruit ripening.figure  <dig>

the transcript abundance of aterf <dig> in arabidopsis is strongly increased by ethylene, which is triggered by the mkk9/mpk3/mpk <dig> pathway  <cit> . the transcript abundance of vvimkk <dig> in the cabernet sauvignon berries was higher in the skin than the pulp, but there were no significant differences for vvimpk <dig> or vvimpk <dig> . this is not too surprising since atmkk <dig> activates atmpk <dig> and atmpk <dig> by phosphorylation  <cit> . in addition, the transcript abundance of aterf <dig> in arabidopsis increases with ros, sa, cold  <cit> , pathogens  <cit> , and water deficit  <cit> . there were no visible signs of pathogen infection in these berries.figure  <dig>

additional circumstantial evidence for ethylene signaling in the late stages of berry ripening was that the transcript abundance of many vvierf tfs was significantly affected  by berry ripening  and/or tissue . the transcript abundance of  <dig> members from the berries was determined to be above background noise levels on the microarray . the expression profiles of the  <dig> significantly affected ap2/erf superfamily members were separated into six distinct clusters by hierarchical clustering and indicated that this superfamily had a complex response during berry ripening . the  <dig> members of cluster  <dig> responded similarly in both the skin and pulp, gradually decreasing with increasing °brix with a large decrease in transcript abundance at the  <dig>  °brix level. cluster  <dig> with  <dig> members, including  <dig> members of the vvierf <dig> clade, had much higher transcript abundance in the skin with a sharp peak at  <dig>  °brix. cluster  <dig>  had similar profiles in both the skin and pulp with a peak abundance at 25° brix. cluster  <dig> with  <dig> members was a near mirror image of cluster  <dig>  with a sharp valley for transcript abundance in the skin between  <dig> and  <dig> °brix. cluster  <dig> had  <dig> members with a steady increase in transcript abundance in the pulp but no substantial increase in the skin until  <dig>  °brix. finally, in cluster  <dig>  there were  <dig> members with a higher transcript abundance in skins compared to pulp. their transcript abundance increased with increasing °brix level, but decreased in the skin.figure  <dig>

the transcript abundance of important components of the ethylene signaling pathway characterized in arabidopsis and presumed to be functional in grape were also affected by °brix level and tissue . three different ethylene receptors, vvietr <dig>  vvietr <dig>  and vviein <dig> decreased with °brix level in the skin, however there was very little or no change in the pulp. likewise, vvictr <dig>  another negative regulator of ethylene signaling that interacts with the ethylene receptors, decreased between  <dig>  and  <dig>  °brix in both the skin and the pulp. the transcript abundance of the positive regulator, vviein <dig>  peaked at  <dig> °brix in both the skin and the pulp. atein <dig> is negatively regulated by atctr <dig> and when it is released from repression, turns on atein <dig>  and the ethylene signaling pathway downstream  <cit> . the transcript abundance of vviein <dig> increased with °brix level, peaking at  <dig> °brix in the skin, and was much higher than in the pulp. although more subtle, its profile was very similar to vvierf6l <dig>  derepression of the negative regulators and the increase in positive regulators indicated that ethylene signaling was stimulated during this late stage of berry ripening.figure  <dig>

flavor pathways
the transcript abundance of many of the genes involved in the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway peaked between  <dig> and  <dig> °brix level, particularly in the skin; this stimulation of transcript abundance continued in both the carotenoid and terpenoid biosynthesis pathways . dxp synthase is a key regulatory step in isoprenoid biosynthesis and its profile was similar to vvierf6l1; its transcript abundance was correlated with the transcript abundance of several terpene synthases in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway .figure  <dig> 
expression profiles of transcripts involved in the isoprenoid, carotenoid and terpenoid pathways. data are means ± se; n =  <dig> 



about 50% of the putative  <dig> functional terpene synthases in the pinot noir reference genome have been functionally characterized  <cit> . another  <dig> genes may be functional but need further functional validation or checking for sequencing and assembly errors. on the nimblegen grape whole-genome array there are  <dig> probe sets representing transcripts of functional, partial and psuedo terpene synthases in pinot noir . it is uncertain how many may be functional in cabernet sauvignon. there were  <dig> probe sets that significantly changed with °brix or the °brix and tissue interaction effect;  <dig> of these are considered functional genes in pinot noir. terpene synthases are separated into  <dig> subfamilies in the pinot noir reference genome; they use a variety of substrates and produce a variety of terpenes  <cit> . many of these enzymes produce more than one terpene. the top  <dig> transcripts that peaked in the skin at the  <dig>  to  <dig> °brix stages were also much higher in the skin relative to pulp . five of the eight probesets match four functionally-classified genes in pinot noir ; these terpene synthases clustered very closely with vvitps <dig>  a functionally annotated - linalool/- nerolidol synthase  <cit> . vvitps <dig>  a -geranyl linalool synthase, was also in the cluster. the other two probesets match partial terpene synthase sequences in the pinot noir reference genome.

the transcript abundance of genes involved with carotenoid metabolism also changed at different °brix levels and with tissue type . ccds are carotenoid cleavage dioxgenases and are involved in norisoprenoid biosynthesis. the transcript abundance of vviccd <dig> changed signficantly with °brix level and was higher in skin than pulp, except at  <dig>  °brix. likewise, the transcript abundance of vviccd4a and vviccd4b changed signficantly with °brix level, but was higher in the pulp than the skin. the transcript abundance of vviccd4c significantly increased with °brix level, but there were no significant differences between tissues. vviccd <dig> and vviccd <dig> produce β- and α-ionone , geranylacetone , and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one  in grapes  <cit> . there were no significant effects on the transcript abundance of vviccd <dig>  the transcript abundance of vviccd <dig> significantly increased with °brix level and was higher in pulp than skin. phytoene synthase, which was also increased in the skin compared to the pulp , and vviccd <dig>  have been associated with β-ionone and β-damascenone biosynthesis  <cit> .

other important grape flavors are derived from the fatty acid metabolism pathway and lead to the production of aromatic alcohols  and esters. the transcript abundance of many genes associated with fatty acid biosynthesis and catabolism changed with °brix level . in particular the transcript abundance of a number of genes were correlated with the transcript abundance of vvierf6l <dig> including vviaccase, acetyl-coa carboxylase; kas iii ; vvioat, ; vvifad8; ; vvilox <dig>  and vvihpl . the transcript abundance of alcohol dehydrogenases  was affected by tissue and °brix level . some adhs are associated with the production of hexenol and benzyl alcohol  <cit> .figure  <dig>

methoxypyrazines give herbaceous/bell pepper aromas  <cit> . they are synthesized early in berry development and gradually diminish to very low levels at maturity. nevertheless, humans can detect very low concentrations of these aroma compounds. four enzymes, vviomt <dig>  vviomt <dig>  vviomt <dig> and vviomt <dig> , synthesize methoxypyrazines  <cit> . the transcript abundance of vviomt <dig> was higher in the pulp than the skin . in addition, the transcript abundance of vviomt <dig> decreased significantly with °brix level in the pulp. there were no significant differences in the trancript abundance in the skin or pulp for vviomt <dig>  vviomt <dig> or vviomt <dig> . there was a high correlation  of the transcript abundance of vviomt <dig> in the pulp  with 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine  concentrations in the berries . the transcript abundance of vviomt <dig>  vviomt <dig>  or vviomt <dig> in either skin or pulp was not correlated with ibmp concentrations . this is consistent with the suggestion that the pulp is the main contributor of ibmp in the berry  <cit> . our data indicated that vviomt <dig> in the pulp may contribute to the ibmp concentration in these berries.figure  <dig>

other fruit ripening tfs
orthologs of rin and spl  tomato transcription factors, which are known to be very important fruit ripening trancription factors  <cit> , were at much higher transcript levels in the skin and decline with °brix level . the transcript abundance of the vvinor ortholog in grape was higher in the pulp and increased slightly to peak at  <dig> °brix. in addition, the transcript abundance of vvirap <dig> , an inhibitor of ripening in tomato , decreased in the skin with a valley at  <dig>  °brix; it belongs to cluster  <dig> of the ap2/erf superfamily .

of particular interest was vviwrky <dig> , which had a very similar transcript profile as vvierf6l <dig> . atwrky <dig> is a tf that promotes leaf senescence and is induced by hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . this is the first report we know of implicating wrky <dig> in fruit ripening . aterf <dig> induces atwrky <dig> and leaf senescence  <cit> , so the interactions between wrky and erf tfs are complex. wrky tfs bind to the wbox elements in promoters and vvierf6l <dig> has a number of wbox elements in its promoter . in addition, atmekk <dig> regulates atwrky <dig>  <cit>  and the transcript abundance of vvimekk <dig> peaked at  <dig>  °brix in the skin as well. interestingly, the transcript abundance of both vvierf <dig> and vvierf <dig>  whose orthologs in arabidopsis promote leaf senescence, were at their highest level of transcript abundance at the lowest °brix levels  examined in this study .

discussion
this study focused on the very late stages of the mature cabernet sauvignon berry when fruit flavors are known to develop. cabernet sauvignon is an important red wine cultivar, originating from the bordeaux region of france. it is now grown in many countries. wines made from cabernet sauvignon are dark red with flavors of dark fruit and berries   <cit> . they also can contain herbaceous characters such as green bell pepper flavor  that are particulary prevalent in underripe grapes  <cit> .

grape flavor is complex consisting not only of many different fruit descriptors, but descriptors that are frequently made up of a complex mixture of aromatic compounds  <cit> . for example, black currant flavor, in part, can be attributed to  <dig> -cineole, 3-methyl-1-butanol, ethyl hexanoate, 2-methoxy-3-isopropylpyrazine, linalool, 4-terpineol, and β-damascenone  <cit>  and major components of raspberry flavor can be attributed to α- and β-ionone, α- and β-phellandrene, linalool, β-damascenone, geraniol, nerol and raspberry ketone  <cit> . some common volatile compounds found in the aroma profiles of these dark fruits and berries include benzaldehyde, 1-hexanol, 2-heptanol, hexyl acetate, β-ionone, β-damascenone, linalool, and α-pinene  <cit> .

in a study of cabernet sauvignon grapes and wines in australia, cabernet sauvignon berry aromas were associated with trans-geraniol and 2-pentyl furan and cabernet sauvignon flavor was associated with 3-hexenol, 2-heptanol, heptadienol and octanal  <cit> . in another comprehensive study of  <dig> volatiles of cabernet sauvignon wines from all over australia, the factors influencing sensory attributes were found to be complex  <cit> ; in part, norisoprenoids and δ − and γ-lactones were associated with sweet and fruity characteristics and red berry and dried fruit aromas were correlated with ethyl and acetate esters. in cabernet sauvignon wines from the usa, sensory attributes were complex also and significantly affected by alcohol level of the wine  <cit> . linalool and hexyl acetate were postitively associated with berry aroma and ibmp was positively correlated with green bell pepper aroma. in france, β-damascenone was found to contribute to cabernet sauvignon wine aroma  <cit> .

thus, flavor development in berries and wines is very complex, being affected by a large number of factors including genetics, chemistry, time and environment. in this paper we begin to examine the changes in transcript abundance that may contribute to flavor development. we show that the transcript abundance of many genes involved in fatty acid, carotenoid, isoprenoid and terpenoid metabolism was increased in the skin and peaked at the °brix levels known to have the highest fruit flavors . many of these are involved in the production of dark fruit flavors such as linalool synthases, carotenoid dioxygenases and lipoxygenases. these genes serve as good candidates for berry development and flavor markers during ripening. a broader range of studies from different cultivars, locations and environments are needed to determine a common set of genes involved in berry and flavor development.

a similar study was conducted on the production of volatile aromas in cabernet sauvignon berries across many developmental stages  <cit> , including a detailed analysis of the °brix levels that was surveyed in this study. they found that the production of alcohol volatiles from the lipoxygenase pathway dominated in the later stages of berry ripening and suggested that the activity of alcohol dehydrogenases also could play an important role.

the abundance of the transcript of vviomt <dig> decreased in the pulp with increasing °brix level and was correlated with ibmp concentrations in the late stages of berry development in this study. both omt <dig>  <cit>  and omt <dig>  <cit>  have been shown to synthesize ibmp. furthermore, the transcript abundance of each gene has been correlated with ibmp concentration, but the transcript abundance of each gene cannot fully account for the total ibmp present in all genotypes and conditions  <cit> . omt <dig> was found to be the major genetic determinant for this trait in two independent studies  <cit> . nevertheless, it is possible that omt <dig> may contribute to the ibmp concentration, because omt <dig> can synthesize ibmp  <cit>  and it is located at the edge of a qtl significantly contributing to this trait  <cit> . furthermore, the majority of ibhp , the precursor for the omt <dig> and omt <dig> biosynthesis of ibmp, is produced in the pulp of the berry  <cit>  complicating the factors that influence ibmp concentration. our results raise questions that require additional research to clarify this relationship of transcript abundance to ibmp concentration, including determination of the rates of biosynthesis and catabolism, enzyme activities, volatilization of ibmp from the berry, as well as the concentrations of substrates for the enzymes involved  <cit> .

there are a number of other transcriptomic ripening studies in grapes and other fruit species  <cit> . many of these have compared broad developmental stages with partial  genome microarrays. one study compared transcriptomic responses of the lates stages of ripening of whole berries of chardonnay  <cit> . this study used a different microarray platform with only about half of the genome represented on the array. in this study,  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed in each of the  <dig> different stages investigated. there were approximately another  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed at one stage versus another. several genes were proposed as good candidates for markers of ripeness and these were also examined in cabernet sauvignon berries using qpcr. several of these candidate genes are consistent with our results in the present study. they include ccd4a , a late embryogenesis abundant protein , a dirigent-like protein , and an s-adenosyl-l-methionine:salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase . of these, the transcript expression of samt was found to be temperature insensitive  <cit> .

like the previous study, the present study focused on very close stages in the mature berry when fruit flavors are known to develop. in contrast to the previous study on chardonnay  <cit> , there were massive changes in the transcript abundance in hundreds of go categories over this narrow window of ripening. this may in part be due to using six biological replicates rather than the standard three, which probably improved the detection of significantly changing transcripts. in addition, we used a different threshold level for statistical signficance and an improved microarray platform, which was able to detect double the number of transcripts.

in the present study, many differences were found between the skin and the pulp, °brix levels and the interaction of tissue and °brix. important fruit ripening processes were affected including ethylene signaling, senescence, volatile aroma production, lipid metabolism and cell wall softening. these data indicate that fruit ripening in the late stages of maturity is a very dynamic and active process.

importance of ethylene in fruit ripening and senescence: climacteric and nonclimacteric fruit
ethylene is involved in climacteric fruit ripening with a co <dig> burst preceding the rise in ethylene  <cit> . in tomato, this occurs at the time the seeds become mature in the mature green fruit stage. at this stage, tomato fruits become sensitive to ethyene and can continue through the ripening stage. prior to the mature breaker stage, ethylene cannot promote tomato ripening to full ripeness.

in nonclimacteric fruit, there is no respiratory burst of co <dig> and the ripening of most nonclimacteric fruits was thought not to respond significantly to an extra application of ethylene  <cit> . however, recently some nonclimacteric fruit such as strawberry  <cit> , bell pepper  <cit>  and grape  <cit>  have been found to produce a small amount of ethylene and appear to have responses to ethylene at certain stages. in the study of grapes, this peak was observed just before the start of veraison, followed by decreases in ethylene concentrations for several weeks afterwards; the late mature stages of ripening were not examined.

ethylene action is dependent upon ethylene concentration and ethylene sensitivity or signaling  <cit> . in this study, there were clear and signficant changes in transcript abundance of genes involved in ethylene signaling and biosynthesis in the late stages of berry ripening. seeds become fully mature at this time . perhaps there is a signal from the seeds when they become mature that allows the fruit to ripen and senesce? perhaps small amounts of ethylene are produced or there is a change in sensitivity to ethylene?

seymour et al.  <cit>  suggested the response of ein <dig> might be a common signaling mechanism for both climacteric and nonclimacteric fruit. the responses of vviein <dig> in this study and in a pepper fruit ripening study  <cit>  are consistent with this hypothesis. in addition, the transcript abundance of vviein <dig> in grape is very responsive to ethylene and the ethylene inhibitor, mcp  <cit> .

there are many other factors other than fruit development that can influence ethylene signaling. could chilling of the fruit or other aspects of the processing of the grapes influence these responses? could there be some influence of other abiotic or biotic stresses? these are questions that can only be addressed in future studies with additional experiments that are designed to answer these questions.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, there are dynamic metabolic changes in the late stages of berry ripening including large changes in abundance of transcripts involved in ethylene signaling, fruit softening, terpenoid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. many of these changes can have important effects that may result in the production of volatile aromas that influence berry flavor. a unique clade of the subfamily ix erf transcription factors was highly expressed in the skin during this ripening phase. the important implications of this research is that ethylene may play a bigger role in this nonclimacteric fruit than previously thought, particularly in the late stages of ripening when flavors are produced.
