BACKGROUND
dietary fatty acids  are highly relevant for human health, since some saturated fa  of medium chain length such as lauric  and myristic  increase the plasmatic cholesterol level and the risk of cardiovascular diseases  <cit> . a protective effect reducing cholesterol in blood is attributed to polyunsaturated fa, but from a nutritional point of view the balance between polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fa  and the n-6/n- <dig> pufa ratio are more appreciated than the content of particular fatty acids  <cit> . it is also well known that fat and long-chain fa, whether in adipose tissue or muscle, affect sensorial and technological properties of meat and meat products  <cit> . the fa content of pig meat products influences their tenderness, juiciness and flavor  <cit> . for instance, the pleasant flavor associated to iberian pig dry-cured hams with high levels of oleic acid and mufa is explained by the presence in these products of high levels of oleic acid-derived volatiles  <cit> .

the fa composition of porcine fat and muscle tissues exhibits moderate to high heritability values, and the results of studies performed on data from several tissues point out the different genetic control of fa composition in diverse fat and muscle tissues . classical studies of qtl detection, based on microsatellites genotyping data from experimental crosses, have reported several qtl affecting fa composition in different porcine tissues , and a few significant qtls in ssc <dig>  <cit> , ssc <dig>  <cit>  and ssc <dig>  <cit>  affecting the content in diverse fat locations of a particular fa. however, only single-trait single-qtl models were used for the corresponding statistical analyses. more complex multitrait models are required for a rigorous checking of pleiotropic qtl effects and for increasing the precision of its estimated location in the genome  <cit> .

the availability of the illumina porcinesnp <dig> beadchip  <cit>  has improved the genetic analyses of complex traits through the use of high-density genotyping markers. some studies with high-density chips using the genome wide association approach  have been carried out for detecting qtls affecting fa content  <cit> . other studies based on classical models accounting for linkage allowed fine-mapping of significant qtls not observed by gwas  <cit> . moreover, the integration of the results of qtl fine-mapping with microarray expression data offers a promising tool for understanding the genetic mechanisms influencing complex traits. the expression level of each probe may be treated as a quantitative trait and the marker genotypes used to map loci with regulatory effect on the gene expression level . so far, only three global analyses have been published for pigs. in these studies, the combination of genome scans for phenotypic qtl  and eqtl has provided key positional candidate genes for important complex pig phenotypes . some variants of this general approach, such as targeted genetical genomics, have been proposed to reduce its high cost  <cit> .

in the present study, an analysis of the genetic basis of the fa composition of backfat  and intramuscular fat  was performed in an experimental backcross between divergent pig lines with the following objectives; 1) to identify significant qtls for these traits from two complementary genome scans based on linkage mapping and gwas, 2) to determine pleiotropic qtls affecting the content of particular fa in both tissues, 3) to propose candidate genes explaining the putative pleiotropic regions combining targeted eqtl and egwas approaches.

RESULTS
in the current study, qtl scans by linkage and gwas have been conducted in order to identify chromosomal regions with significant tissue-specific and tissue-consistent effects on the fa composition of two fat deposits, imf and bf. an additional targeted eqtl analysis focused on regions showing tissue-consistent effects was conducted to identify powerful candidate genes underlying these pleiotropic effects .figure  <dig>

linkage qtl scan
different linkage qtl scans, using single and multitrait models fitting diverse qtl effects, were carried out in order to identify tissue-specific or tissue-consistent qtl for fa composition of backfat and intramuscular fat. the performed qtl scans were conditional on the genotyping data of  <dig>  snps evenly distributed along each chromosome. the single qtl scan for fa composition in bf revealed at least  <dig> significant qtls, taking into account the test multiplicity  with effects on the percentages of c14: <dig>  c16: <dig>  c16: <dig>  c16: <dig>  c17: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c20: <dig> fatty acids in nine porcine autosomes  . furthermore, at least  <dig> significant qtls  with effects on the percentages in imf of c14: <dig>  c16: <dig>  c16: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c18: <dig>  and c20: <dig> were identified in nine porcine autosomes  .table  <dig>

pleiotropic qtls with consistent effects on both tissues were identified following the decision tree of the statistical contrasts shown in figure 2a. those putative pleiotropic qtls  identified in a qtl genome scan using a model fitting pleiotropic effects on a particular fa in both fat depots, were tested in a second step against reduced bivariate models fitting one single qtl effect on bf or imf. subsequently, the pleiotropic qtl that remained significant were tested against a model considering two different qtls on the same chromosome, one for each tissue. the results revealed two highly significant pleiotropic qtl regions in ssc <dig> at  <dig> cm for c16:0bf and c16:0imf and at  <dig> cm for c16:1bf and c16:1imf . other pleiotropic qtl regions were also identified in the ssc <dig> at  <dig> cm for c20:3bf and c20:3imf and at  <dig> cm in ssc <dig> for c16:0bf and c16:0imf . however, the results of lr tests indicated that models fitting two qtls by chromosome were more likely than the putative pleiotropic qtl for c16: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c20: <dig> mapping in ssc <dig>  and for c16: <dig> in ssc <dig> . moreover, as several qtl mapped at closed positions on ssc <dig> , multitrait models including different combinations of fa were used to refine the qtl positions. the results supported the presence on ssc <dig> of the pleiotropic qtl affecting c14:0bf , c16:0bf , c16:1bf , c16:0imf and c16:1imf at  <dig> cm  and two qtls with effect on c20:3bf and c18:2imf located at  <dig> and  <dig> cm respectively.figure  <dig>

gwas scan
similarly to the linkage qtl analyses, single and bivariate gwas were performed in order to identify regions with tissue-specific or tissue-consistent effects on fa composition. the gwas was conducted using a subset of  <dig>  snps from the porcinesnp <dig> genotyping bead chip  previously selected for building a high-density linkage map  <cit> . the single association analysis revealed a total of  <dig> and  <dig> snps statistically associated to the content of some fa in bf and imf, respectively. those chromosomal regions containing more than two significant snps  not fully linked and with a distance between contiguous snps lower than  <dig>  cm, were set up as significant trait-associated snps  regions. a total of  <dig> tas regions, containing  <dig> tas, distributed across ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig> and ssc <dig>  showed association with fa composition of bf . in addition,  <dig> tas regions, containing  <dig> tas, distributed across ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig> and ssc <dig>  showed association with fa composition of imf .table  <dig>

pleiotropic tas regions were identified following the decision tree of the statistical contrasts shown in figure 2b. subsequently to the pleiotropic tas region identification  by gwas using a model fitting pleiotropic effects on a particular fa, in both fat tissues, the most significant snps of each region were tested against their respective single effects in bf or imf. the results of lr tests revealed six significant pleiotropic tas regions shown in table  <dig> with their corresponding position indicated in mb. these regions correspond to the positions in genetic distance:  <dig> - <dig>  cm on ssc <dig>   <dig> - <dig>  cm on ssc <dig> and  <dig> - <dig>  cm on ssc <dig> for c16:0bf and c16:0imf,  <dig> - <dig>  cm on ssc <dig> for c18:2bf and c18:2imf and  <dig> - <dig>  cm and  <dig> - <dig>  cm on ssc <dig> for c16:1bf and c16:1imf.table  <dig>

targeted eqtl mapping and association analyses of longissimus dorsi gene expression data
according to the previous linkage results, an eqtl scan focused on chromosomal regions showing tissue-consistent effects on fa was conducted with longissimus dorsi gene expression data, one of the tissues with fatty acid composition data. the analyzed regions corresponded to the intervals of 80– <dig> cm in ssc <dig>  1– <dig> cm in ssc <dig> and 53– <dig> cm in ssc <dig>  additionally, in order to reduce the number of conducted tests, the analyses were performed for  <dig> preselected probes representing genes related to fatty acid metabolism. putative eqtls were considered those whose confidence interval brackets the target gene position on the chromosome  <cit> . although  <dig> eqtls were identified at nominal p-value < <dig>  , only one eqtl for the mgst <dig> gene expression at  <dig> cm on ssc <dig>  reached the established false discovery ratio , calculated from the effective number of expression probes  and the number of tested positions for each one of the analyzed chromosome regions .

similarly to the eqtl, association analyses for longissimus dorsi gene expression data were conducted focusing on the four tas regions showing tissue-consistent results according to the previous gwas, pleiotropic ptas regions. these regions corresponded to the intervals  <dig> - <dig>  mb of ssc <dig> ,  <dig> - <dig>  mb and  <dig> - <dig>  mb of ssc <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig>  mb  of ssc <dig>  putative gene expression tas  were considered those where the tas region bracket the target gene position on the chromosome. a total of  <dig> etas regions were identified at nominal p-value <  <dig>  , eight of them reached the assumed false discovery ratio , calculated from the effective number of expression probes and the effective number of snps for each one of the analyzed tas regions . two etas regions in ssc <dig> showed effects on lipg and ldlr genes expression, two in ssc <dig> on rdh <dig> and nudt <dig> and four in ssc <dig> on mgst <dig>  kit, il1r <dig> and elovl <dig> genes .table  <dig>

since the gene expression analyses were focused on those regions showing pleiotropic effects on the fa content of both analyzed tissues, and as the limited number of available bf gene expression data  did not allow us to conduct linkage or association analyses, correlations between imf and bf gene expression measures were calculated. the correlation values for the genes affected by eqtl or etas in the previous analyses are shown in figure  <dig>  significant and positive correlations between their expression levels were observed for ldlr, kit, elovl <dig>  rdh <dig> and mgst <dig> genes. these results may indicate a common expression regulatory element for these genes in both tissues.figure  <dig>

discussion
in the present study a whole-genome scan based on high-density genotyping has been conducted following different strategies, qtl scan by linkage and gwas, in order to identify chromosomal regions with significant tissue-specific and tissue-consistent effects on the fa composition of two fat deposits, intramuscular fat and backfat. the justification of this double approach arises from the different hypothesis about the causative mutations underlying each method. the linkage qtl scan is based on the assumption of alternative alleles fixed in each parental line of the experimental intercross. however, the gwas is free of this assumption about frequencies, and the detected associations are based on the linkage disequilibrium between snps and causative mutations. when the frequencies of causative mutations are not largely divergent in the p arental lines, the linkage qtl analyses lose detection power, and therefore gwas would contribute to the identification of chromosomal regions undetected in the linkage qtl scan. in the current study, several chromosomal regions affecting fa composition were detected by both approaches, as the regions identified on ssc <dig>  ssc <dig> and ssc <dig> affecting diverse fa in bf or the identified ones on ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig> and ssc <dig> affecting also several fa in imf. however, other significant genome regions were identified only by one of the two approaches. particularly remarkable were the associations found on ssc <dig> affecting several fa in both bf and imf which were undetected by the linkage scan, and the qtl region on ssc <dig> at  <dig> cm affecting c16: <dig> content in bf and imf, undetected by gwas. moreover, the great majority of the regions with pleiotropic effects on a particular fa in both fat deposits were detected only by one of the approaches, except those identified on ssc <dig> for c16: <dig> and c16: <dig> acids. these results show that both approaches can provide complementary results, as reported in previous studies  <cit> .

a comparison of the results obtained for both fat depots showed that in general those obtained in bf were more numerous and significant than those detected in imf. in fact the qtl and tas regions detected on ssc <dig>  which affected c16:0bf, were the most significant of the scans carried out in both fat deposits. several previous studies revealed that the heritability estimates of fatty acid composition are lower in imf than in other fat depots, pointing out a larger environmental component for imf fatty acid composition than for other tissues  <cit> . even so, the analyses conducted in the present study have allowed us to confirm the existence of several tissue-consistent regions showing effects on fatty acid composition. most of the detected qtls and tas regions were tissue-specific, supporting the hypothesis that the major part of the genetic basis of fatty acid composition differs among fat tissues.

joining linkage qtl and gwas results, over  <dig> chromosomal regions showed association with fatty acid composition specifically in bf. although many regions with effects on fatty acid composition in bf have already been reported in previous studies , new associations in  <dig> of the  <dig> autosomes are reported here for the first time . likewise, over  <dig> chromosomal regions showed association with fatty acid composition specifically in imf. several regions detected by linkage and association analyses in this fat depot had already been identified in a previous gwas study conducted on the same animal material by ramayo-caldas et al.  <cit>  or in other previous studies using different animal material  but six new regions in four different chromosomes are reported here for the first time . slight differences in the position of the overlapping qtl regions can be observed between ramayo-caldas et al.,  <cit>  study and the present one likely due to the different porcine assembly version and marker numbers employed in each study. the sscrofa <dig> assembly version and  <dig>  snps were employed in the study of ramayo-caldas et al.  <cit> , while re-annotation of the snps with the updated sscrofa <dig>  assembly version and a selected set of  <dig>  snps have been employed in the present study.table  <dig> 
summary of the new qtls for fatty acid composition identified in the current study




the current study has mainly focused on identifying chromosomal regions showing tissue-consistent effects for fatty acid composition measured in both bf and imf. the results of the present study allowed us to identify for the first time with a formal pleiotropic statistical approach seven different pleiotropic regions with effects on particular fatty acids in both fat deposits. moreover, the conducted complementary eqtl scans have allowed us to highlight particular candidate genes.

the tissue-consistent region identified on ssc <dig> for c16: <dig> fatty acid content was detected by gwas analyses. the frequencies of the most significant snp within the tas region were far from the hypothesis of alternative alleles in the parental generation: the h3ga0002028g allele was fixed in the founder iberian boars and at a frequency equal to  <dig>  in the founder landrace sows. this tas region, that expands  <dig>  mb and contains  <dig> snps with significant effects, revealed also an association with the gene expression in longissimus of two important genes  with respective functional roles in lipid transport and hdl catabolism. moreover, a positive significant correlation was detected for muscle and backfat ldlr expression, suggesting that a common expression regulatory element of this gene could be acting in both tissues, in accordance to the hypothesis of pleiotropic effects. because the ldlr gene is mapped at  <dig>  mb on ssc <dig>  a potential regulator of ldlr transcription should be mapping within the ssc <dig> pleiotropic region under study. regulatory binding sites in the ldlr gene promoter have been described for c/ebpbeta, ap-2alpha isoform  <dig>  ap- <dig>  ap-2alpha isoform  <dig>  ppar-gamma <dig>  ppar-gamma <dig>  ap-2alpha isoform  <dig>  ap-2alpha, ap-2alphaa and sp <dig> transcription factors . however, none of them has been mapped within or even close to the target region up to now.

the two tissue-consistent regions identified on ssc <dig> for c16: <dig> and c18: <dig> fatty acids were also detected by gwas analyses. for these two ptas regions, the most significant snp alleles, asga0087140c and marc0090207g, were fixed in the founder iberian boars and displayed  <dig>  and  <dig>  frequencies in the founder landrace sows, respectively, as well far from the hypothesis of alternative frequencies in the parental populations. the region showing effects on c16: <dig> , revealed no association with gene expression in longissimus dorsi. by contrast, the ssc <dig> region showing effects on c18: <dig> , provided association with the expression of rdh <dig> and nudt <dig> genes. besides, a high positive correlation  was found between muscle and backfat nudt <dig> expression. the nudt <dig> gene encodes for a peroxisomal coenzyme a diphosphatase whose function, among others, is to remove potentially toxic oxidized coa disulfide from peroxisomes to maintain the capacity for beta-oxidation of fatty acids. although nudt <dig> gene maps on other chromosome different than the pleiotropic region under studio, the promoter region of this gene contains a known binding site for transcription factor pbx <dig> . the pbx <dig> gene maps very close to the target region, at  <dig>  mb in ssc <dig>  therefore, a mutation on pbx <dig> could potentially modify nudt <dig> gene expression, altering the peroxisome capacity for fatty acids oxidation. further structural studies focused on pbx <dig> gene would allow us to determine the mutation providing nudt <dig> expression changes, potentially responsible for the c18: <dig> contents in both fat deposits.

the most reliable results were found in ssc <dig>  where linkage qtl scan as well as gwas revealed significant pleiotropic regions with effects on c16: <dig> and c16: <dig> fatty acids. moreover, the multitrait qtl linkage analysis allowed us to statistically determine for the first time the presence of a region with pleiotropic effects in both fat deposits with a maximum at  <dig> cm affecting c14:0bf , c16:0bf , c16:1bf , c16:0imf and c16:1imf. in both fat tissues, the iberian q allele would increase the content of sfa and mufa and decrease the pufa content. the effects found are consistent with those described by clop et al.  <cit>  and sánchez et al.  <cit>  on c16: <dig> but only in bf. in the current study, the effects have been detected in both tissues and not just on c16: <dig> but also on c16: <dig>  in addition, the same pleiotropic regions revealed significant associations with the expression in longissimus dorsi of three interesting genes elovl <dig>  mgst <dig> and kit, in addition to significant positive correlations between their expression values in loin muscle and backfat. the only significant eqtl identified corresponded to this chromosomal region on ssc <dig>  among these genes, mgst <dig> and elovl <dig> fall within or very close to the target pleiotropic region . the mgst <dig> gene encodes a microsomal glutathione s-transferase, a protein that is involved in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and prostaglandin e from arachydonic fatty acid   <cit> . the role of the elovl <dig> in fatty acid metabolism is even clearer, as it codes for a fatty acid elongase which catalyzes the elongation of fas with 12– <dig> carbons to c <dig>  <cit> . moreover, in a previous study conducted on the same animal material  <cit> , the authors detected a strong effect of elovl6:c.-533c > t snp on c16: <dig> and c16: <dig>  percentages measured in bf and imf. furthermore, significant differences in elovl <dig> gene expression were observed when animals were classified by the elovl6:c.-533c > t genotype in bf tissue, but not in longissimus muscle. despite the strong association of elovl6:c.-533c > t polymorphism with the bf gene expression and with c16: <dig> and c16: <dig> percentages, the authors identified a stronger association of another snp, alga <dig>  outside but near to the elovl <dig> gene. all these results, together with the obtained in the present study, seem to indicate that the mutation underlying the qtl would be located in a regulatory element close to the elovl <dig> gene, affecting elovl <dig> gene transcription and other nearby genes, such as mgst <dig> and even the kit gene. regulatory binding sites in the elovl <dig> promoter have been described for srebp- <dig>  mlx, hnf4-gamma, klf <dig>  esrr-alpha and sp <dig> transcription factors  <cit> . however, none of them has been mapped within or even close to the ssc <dig> target region up to now. therefore, further studies focused on possible regulatory elements around the elovl <dig> gene region would allow us to determine the actual causal mutation underlying this qtl.

finally, two other tissue-consistent regions were identified on ssc <dig> for c20: <dig> and on ssc <dig> for c16: <dig> by linkage qtl scans. even if significant eqtl at nominal p-value were detected on these pqtl regions, no eqtls remained significant after multiple test correction.

although the candidate genes proposal has been based on gene expression data, it should be taken into account that the causal mutation does not necessarily provide gene expression changes. therefore for those regions were significant eqtl or etas regions could not be detected, strong positional and functional candidate genes can be highlighted. for instance, the rgs <dig> gene maps within the confidence interval of ssc <dig> region  and it constitutes a strong functional candidate gene for that ptas region . the rgs <dig> gene codes for a member of the large family of rgs proteins that participate in several physiological processes. specifically, rgs <dig> controls the balance between adipose tissue lipolysis and lipogenesis through fatty acid and glucose homeostasis  <cit> . similarly, the trib <dig> gene maps within the confidence interval of ssc <dig> qtl  and also constitutes a strong functional candidate gene for this qtl region . the trib <dig> gene codes for a tribbles protein, which has been associated with the control of fatty acid synthesis and insulin resistance as well as regulating plasma triglyceride and hdl cholesterol levels in human species. several mechanisms of molecular action have been proposed for the tribbles mediated control of these processes, including the regulation of signaling events, protein turnover and transcription  <cit> . further structural studies of rgs <dig> and trib <dig> genes would help in the identification of the mutations underlying the quoted qtl effects in ssc <dig> for c16: <dig> and ssc <dig> for c16: <dig> content, respectively.

in spite of the limited number of animals employed in the present study, we have obtained consistent results, confirmed and identified new qtl regions for fa composition in bf and imf, pleiotropic effects in both fat tissues and consistent gene expression results that allowed us to better understand the genetic basis of the fatty acid composition in porcine.

CONCLUSIONS
the complementary genome scans conducted in the present study have allowed us to confirm several chromosome regions previously associated to fatty acid composition in backfat and intramuscular fat, but even more, to identify  <dig> new ones on ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig> and ssc <dig>  although most of the detected regions were tissue-specific, supporting the hypothesis that the major part of the genes responsible for fa composition differs among tissues, seven chromosomal regions with tissue-consistent effects were detected on ssc <dig> for c16: <dig>  on ssc <dig> for c16: <dig> and c18: <dig>  on ssc <dig> for c16: <dig> and c16: <dig>  on ssc <dig> for c20: <dig> and on ssc <dig> for c16: <dig>  the complementary eqtl scans focused on the identified tissue-consistent regions have allowed us to identify some powerful candidate genes and target regions to be responsible for these pleiotropic effects, as the pbx <dig> transcription factor and a transcription regulatory element close to elovl <dig> gene.
