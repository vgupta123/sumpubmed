BACKGROUND
the employment of sewage sludge on agricultural fields has been recognized worldwide as a promising way to manage this kind of residue, as it can minimize environmental pollution, in addition to giving it useful destination, what is done at the wastewater treatment plants . none the less, careful consideration regarding its quality and impacts on human health ought to be given, since the presence of pathogens in sewage sludge, including salmonella spp., have been documented in manifold studies  <cit> .

in order to protect both human and environmental health, brazilian legislation issued by conselho nacional do meio ambiente , which is a branch of the federal environmental council, conama no 375/ <dig> – has classified sewage sludge in two distinct classes: a  and b . for class a, the maximum values for thermotolerant coliforms is ≤ <dig> mpn/gtotal solids , the total absence of salmonella spp. in 10 g of total solids, followed by < <dig>  helminth viable ova/gts and ≤ <dig>  enterovirus/g ts, while for class b the standards are ≤ <dig> mpn/gts for thermotolerant coliforms and < <dig> helminth viable ova/gts  <cit> . some countries or some of their respective regions have been establishing microbiological and parasitological standards for biosolids, such as the usa legislation  <cit> , the united kingdom  <cit> , australia , finland and new zealand  <cit> .

the employment of sewage sludge with no sanitary criteria or barriers, particularly in agricultural fields, intensifies the potential to disseminate such pathogen.

of late, a worldwide increase in the number of outbreaks involving salmonella spp. related to the fresh-cut produce industry and the consumption of fresh-cut vegetables has been observed. such outbreaks are caused by a few salmonella serotypes which have the capability to resist to environmental stresses, remaining viable for extended periods on field crops  <cit> . it has been observed that salmonella can regrow in the soil and remain viable for more than two years after soil inoculation  <cit> .

in a global survey conducted from  <dig> to  <dig>  salmonella enteritidis, and salmonella typhimurium were considered to be the most isolated non-typhoid salmonella in fifty-nine countries  <cit> . none of the less, in the city of são paulo , where surveillance studies indicated an increase in the prevalence of salmonella enteritidis both in clinical and environmental samples, whereas studies conducted in agona, ohio and albany demonstrated the most isolated serotypes from sewage samples  <cit> .

the presence of virulence genes such as inva and ssel, which are located, respectively, on the pathogenicity island i  and ii , has been used as evidence of pathogenicity  <cit> . the virulence genes which compose spi pathogenicity island are responsible for the entry of salmonella spp. into host epithelial cells. the pathogenic genes presented in spi- <dig> are related to modifications in host cell functions, being thus essential for survival and replication of salmonella enterica within host macrophages  <cit> . the spvc virulence gene, present in plasmids and/or chromosomes, strengthens the systemic proliferation of the pathogen and, furthermore, contributes to its replication in extra-intestinal sites  <cit> . the presence of these three virulence genes predicts overall pathogenicity, invasiveness and replication capabilities of salmonella species.

antimicrobial resistance patterns for typhoidal and non-typhoidal salmonella are constantly changing, and the treatment of infections caused by multidrug resistant strains  poses a serious public health concern. a study conducted in brazil with salmonella spp. strains isolated from clinical specimens which were collected in each of the five brazilian regions, detected that this microorganism presented low resistance to all antibiotics tested, except for cloranfenicol  <cit> . later on, a study conducted by medeiros et al.  <cit>  with the participation of several brazilian states, pointed out to the fact that all the  <dig> salmonella strains which were previously isolated from chicken carcasses were resistant to at least one antibiotic, and that  <dig> % of the samples assessed were mdr.

in the light of the fact that the use of sewage sludge on agricultural fields can be considered a way to spread such pathogen, and therefore risk the health of the population exposed, the aim of this study was to survey salmonella spp. and its serotypes in sewage sludge samples from five wwtps located in são paulo metropolitan region . in addition to so, we intended to search for the presence of virulence genes, plasmids, and antimicrobial resistance/resistant profiles in the isolated strains.

RESULTS
in total,  <dig> samples were collected from the five wwtp sites throughout the 12 months of  <dig>  and analysed in order to observe salmonella spp. presence. table  <dig> shows salmonella concentrations in sludge samples from each wwtp studied from january to december  <dig>  this bacterium was detected in  <dig> %  of all samples analysed. bacteria concentration above < <dig>  mpn/g ts  was detected in  <dig> %  of all samples analysed. the highest concentration of salmonella spp. was found in wwtp  <dig>  where counts ranged from dl  to  <dig>  mpn/g. the lowest salmonella spp. concentration was found in wwtp  <dig>  and wwtp  <dig> , and no salmonella spp. was isolated in wwtp  <dig> table  <dig>

discussion
this study aims to present the level of salmonella contamination in sewage sludge from wwtps located in the most populated brazilian metropolitan area. data concerning the presence and concentration of such pathogen in sewage sludge are scarce in brazil. thus, the results herein reported could constitute an informational dataset, which would be used in order to give further support to interventional measures developed by sanitary authorities and also to the process of establishing guidelines for sludge usage on agricultural fields.

none of the less, we have also observed a huge difference in salmonella spp. concentration amongst the five wwtps assessed. in wwtp  <dig>  wwtp  <dig>  and wwtp  <dig>  lime stabilizations were performed, which, according to bean et al.  <cit> , increases ph values up to  <dig>  thus possibly eliminating all bacteria. in wwtp  <dig> and  <dig> where lime stabilization was not performed, salmonella spp. concentration was higher if in comparison with wwtp  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

it is quite common to find such differences among results concerning the presence or concentration of salmonella spp. in sewage sludge worldwide, even in those which undergo the same treatment process . in the present study, the frequency of positive samples were above dl  in  <dig> %  of the samples analyzed, which was below the figures derived from other studies  <cit>  and  <cit> , which registered  <dig> - 100%  and 58% , respectively. the highest concentration of salmonella spp. was found in wwtp  <dig> , which is in agreement with the review previously carried out by sidhu and toze  <cit> , wherein the concentration usually varied from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> mpn/g ts. wong et al.  <cit> , on the contrary, found lower concentrations than the ones from the above mentioned studies, that is, ranging from  <dig>  mpn/4 g to  <dig>  mpn/4 g  in sludge from a wwtp in michigan . such differences may be explained by the complex chemical sludge composition which differs from one country to another, type of treatment applied, regrowth or the presence of growth inhibitory factors, and population epidemiological profile  <cit> . although distinct epidemiological studies have indicated the presence of salmonella enteritidis in sewage sludge, in the present study such serotype has not been detected. the absence of such specific serotype could be explained due to the limited number of strains serotyped. similar results were noticed in sweden  <cit> . salström, in  <dig>  stated that such results could be due to the fact that this serotype is best adapted to human and animal hosts rather than to stressful environmental conditions  <cit> . none of the less, the presence of several serotypes in sewage sludge after outbreaks related to the ingestion of raw fruits and vegetables, such as s. infantis, s. newport, s. javiana, s. oranienburg, s. mbandaka, s. anatum, s. müenchen, and s. typhimurium  <cit> , was observed. furthermore, serotypes s. newport and s. typhimurium have a remarkable capacity to form a biofilm on leaves  <cit>  and then to invade various tissues of plants  <cit> .

the presence of spvc gene was found in only two out of the three salmonella typhimurium isolated strains, harbouring also inva and ssel genes. peterson et al.  <cit>  reported that up to that moment, the spvc gene had been found only in five salmonella strains: s. cholerasuis, s. dublin, s. enteritidis, and s. typhimurium. thus, the salmonella typhimurium strains mentioned in this study could represent a threat, as three virulence genes were detected even after the sewage sludge treatment.

from the  <dig> strains tested,  <dig> harboured ssel as well as the inva virulence genes, however two strains , did not harbour the latter virulence gene. the inva gene is widely recognised as a genetic marker for salmonella enterica strains, as so can be found in almost all strains, being even used for pcr identification in this group  <cit> . instead, upon assessing  <dig> different salmonella enterica strains, rahn et al.  <cit> , found that  <dig> % of those strains harboured the inva gene. therefore, although found in the group related to the present study, the presence of inva gene is not universal.

forty per cent of the  <dig> strains identified in this study presented plasmids . according to rychlik et al. <cit> , high molecular weight plasmids  are usually related to virulence genes or as resistance to antimicrobial agents; and low weight plasmids have not yet been fully comprehended, however, some of them could be related as resistant to heavy metals and also to other substances found in the environment. although the isolation techniques performed in our study do not distinguish between high and low molecular weight plasmids, it was possible to observe the presence of such elements in 40% of the strains, including two salmonella typhimurium, which presented the spvc gene. the existence of plasmids in salmonella strains in this study might come as a result in regard to the presence of heavy metals and high sulphur concentrations that are commonly present in são paulo wastewaters and sewage sludge  <cit> .

concerning antimicrobial resistance, out of the five strains which were resistant to two or more drugs, four harboured plasmids, and one salmonella agona strain was resistant to two antimicrobial agents, presenting no plasmid at all . singh et al.  <cit>  perceived that the presence of plasmids is not mandatory for the occurrence of antimicrobial drug resistance in salmonella enterica strains, once such resistant genes can also be found in chromosomes.

the results demonstrated in this research show that  <dig> %  of the strains were resistant to two antimicrobial agents, and  <dig> %  were mdr. similar results were found by sahlström et al.  <cit>  – where 12%  of salmonella isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, and 7%  were mdr strains. such results are quite different from those related to other studies previously conducted in brazil, where salmonella strains from human and non-human sources presented higher resistance to antimicrobial agents. in rio de janeiro, fonseca et al.  <cit>  isolated  <dig> salmonella infantis samples derived from stools of hospitalized children and found that  <dig> strains were resistant to at least two antimicrobial agents.

studies conducted by oliveira et al.  <cit>  and medeiros et al.  <cit>  found in a farm strains of salmonella in animal waste which were resistant to antibiotics, hence demonstrating that such kind of strain is circulating freely in the environment, and such fact can be considered as a crucial concern in case sewage sludge is used in agriculture.

although the present study demonstrates a vast number of susceptible strains, the presence of an esbl-producing and ciprofloxacin-resistant salmonella  is worrisome. since resistance to this antibiotic has increased and so has the production of esbl  <cit> , and also seeing that such is the alternative antibiotic with the aim of controlling mdr strains, treatment options are now limited.

eventually, we also ought to take into account that some studies have presented the ability salmonella spp. presents when it comes to regrowth in soil, internalization phenomena and its growth within plants tissues, as well as its capacity to survive for long periods in soil and crops  <cit> . therefore, its presence must be considered as a major concern, even if such is found in low concentrations.

CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained in this study demonstrate that several genres of salmonella are circulating in the environment, including mdr strains, therefore they can easily be found in sewage sludge. although salmonella enteritidis strains were not isolated in this study, the serotypes herein mentioned are implicated in several worldwide outbreaks related to these bacteria. moreover, certain virulence factors were found in three samples of salmonella typhimurium which harboured inva, ssel and spvc. therefore in order to avoid the spreading of such bacteria through the consumption of fresh products the application of sewage sludge in agricultural soils should only be allowed with the implementation of sanitary barriers, under the supervision of environmental and health authorities, such as different types of sewage sludge stabilizations, already present in other countries.
