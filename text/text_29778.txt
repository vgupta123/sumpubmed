BACKGROUND
zinc finger  dna binding proteins can be used to target functional protein domains to specific regions in complex genomes. for example, zinc finger nucleases  have tremendous potential for introducing site-specific gene knockouts or gene targeting events with high efficiency in various cell types including human <cit> . a zfn consists of two zinc finger proteins  each fused to a monomeric foki nuclease domain. when the zfps co-locate to adjacent sequences within the genome, the nuclease monomers are able to dimerize, generating an active nuclease that cleaves the double-stranded dna at the target site. in the presence of exogenous donor dna, genetic material may be exchanged through repair by homologous recombination; alternatively, the break may be repaired by non-homologous end joining, which is an error-prone mechanism that commonly results in knockout mutations  <cit> . to date, zfns have been used to manipulate endogenous genes in several organisms, e.g., tobacco, maize, fruit fly, zebrafish, rats, and human  <cit> , and are being evaluated in human clinical trials, including gene therapies to treat aids  <cit> .

zinc finger dna binding domains, especially the c2h <dig> class of zinc fingers, have been exploited for performing targeted genome modification because they can be engineered to bind a wide range of desired dna sequences. each individual c2h <dig> zinc finger consists of an α-helix  and a β-hairpin, stabilized by a single zinc ion coordinated through interactions with cysteine and histidine residues. individual zfs recognize and bind specific triplet dna sequences through base-specific contacts within the major groove of double-stranded dna <cit> . extended dna sequences can be targeted by joining together several zf domains  <cit> .

zfps engineered using the recently developed oligomerized pool engineering  method have been reported to function with high success rates in vivo, particularly for zinc finger nucleases   <cit> . for constructing zfps that recognize 9-bp targets, the open method involves combinatorial assembly and subsequent selection of fingers from three pre-constructed pools, each of which contains up to  <dig> different engineered zf recognition helix "solutions" for a chosen dna triplet  <cit> . currently, pools are available for all  <dig> gnn triplets and several of the tnn triplets for each position in a three-finger array  <cit> . zfns generated by open have been used to target genes in tobacco, zebrafish, and human cells with high efficiency  <cit> .

because using the open procedure requires investment of time and effort and because there are often numerous potential targetable sites in any given gene, it is desirable to focus experiments on target sites that are most likely to yield functional zfps. for example, there are  <dig>  open zfn sites in the protein encoding regions of the zebrafish genome . while open often generates zfps that function well in a bacterial two-hybrid  reporter system  <cit> , it does not have a 100% success rate. thus, to reduce the experimental effort involved in applying the open procedure, we sought to develop a computational approach to identify the "best" targets, i.e., those most likely to be successfully targeted by open, from among the relatively large number of theoretically "targetable" zfp sites that may exist for any chosen gene or genomic region of interest.

in this study, we demonstrate that sequence characteristics of zfp target sites, when used as input to naïve bayes or support vector machine  classifiers, can be used to reliably predict whether a specific dna sequence will  be successfully targeted by open. the performance of these classifiers on two experimentally validated datasets of zf target sites suggests that their use could substantially reduce the experimental effort required to generate a functional zfn using the open method.

RESULTS
results from several groups  <cit>  have suggested that zfp recognition sites with a high purine nucleotide content, especially those containing several gnn-triplets, more frequently correspond to "active" targets for zinc finger proteins generated using modular assembly. to investigate whether such potential biases could be exploited to identify optimal sequences for zfp targeting using open, we analyzed sequence and base composition characteristics of sites targeted by this method.

for this study, we first generated an experimentally validated dataset, zfts <dig>  consisting of  <dig> nine bp target sites for which open did or did not successfully yield zfps. zfts <dig> includes  <dig> zf target sites from recently published open experiments  <cit>  and  <dig> open zf target sites which we report here for the first time. each target site in the dataset was assigned a class label of either "active"  or "inactive" . "active" target sites were those yielding at least one zfp that showed dna-binding activity in a well-validated bacterial two-hybrid  reporter assay . "inactive" target sites were those that failed to yield a zfp that showed activity in the b2h reporter assay. all  <dig> functionally validated zfp target sites and their assigned labels are provided in additional file  <dig> - table s <dig> 

differences in base composition at each position within active 9-bp target sites were also analyzed. as shown in figure 1c, thymine is generally disfavored in active target sites, with strong negative propensities in the 1st and 7th positions of active target sites. other residues showed marginally positive propensities in most positions. because available open reagents are currently limited to those that target gnn and tnn triplets  <cit>  , it is not possible to evaluate the significance of the relatively low percentage of adenine and cytosine residues in positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

taken together, the results of these analyses suggested that base composition biases in active versus inactive zfp target sites could be exploited by machine learning classifiers to predict whether a specific dna sequence can be targeted successfully using the open procedure. machine learning classifiers that use a string of sequence identities as input have been successfully applied to a variety of problems, including protein functional site classification  <cit> . because several different machine learning classifiers we tested gave comparable results , here we present representative results obtained using two types of classifiers: naïve bayes and support vector machines .

we compared classifiers trained using three different target site sequence encodings: i) sequence identity:  <dig> nucleotide identities corresponding directly to the target site sequence; ii) base counts:  <dig> numerical values representing the overall base counts of g,a,c,t in the target site; iii) positional base counts:  <dig> numerical values encoding the position-specific base composition of the target site .

the receiver operating characteristic  curves in figure  <dig> illustrate the tradeoffs between true positive rate , i.e., the percentage of active target sites correctly predicted as such, and false positive rate , i.e., the percentage of inactive sites incorrectly predicted to be active, for the different target sequence encodings. using the base counts and positional base counts encodings, the naïve bayes and svm classifiers gave similar results. based on the area under the curve  of the roc curves, the best overall results were obtained using the sequence identity encoding with the naïve bayes classifier , which slightly outperformed the best svm classifier . we designate the sequence-based naïve bayes classifier, zifopt, for zinc finger open targeter.

to ensure that the performance of zifopt on zfts <dig> was not over-estimated due to over-fitting, we generated a second completely independent data set of experimentally validated zfp target sites. zfts <dig> consists of  <dig> 9-bp target sites that were chosen by experts as ideal candidates for open selection . active zfps were found for  <dig> of the  <dig> sites tested. on this dataset, zifopt performance was comparable in terms of overall accuracy  and specificity+ , but with reduced roc auc . to assist users in choosing the best zfp target sites, therefore, we also provide a confidence score derived from the posterior probability returned by zifopt , which allows users to rank the predicted active target sites. as shown in table  <dig>  choosing potential targets with confidence scores ≥  <dig>  results in improved accuracy , specificity+  and sensitivity+ .

due to the large number of potential open target sites for most genomic targets of interest, it is desirable to identify a subset of target sites with the greatest chance of success. currently, open pools are available for  <dig> triplets in position  <dig>   <dig> triplets in position  <dig>  and  <dig> triplets in position  <dig> of a 3-finger zfp. hence open can, in theory, target  <dig>  distinct sites. because  <dig> of these sites are not targetable due to dam or dcm methylation,  <dig>  distinct 9-bp zfp target sites are currently targetable. the zifopt classifier, when optimized for correlation coefficient, predicts that  <dig>   of these sites will be active target sites. for zf nuclease sites, which consist of two zf array sites, open can theoretically target a total  <dig> , <dig> distinct nuclease sites . zifopt predicts that only  <dig> , <dig>  of these nuclease sites will have two active sites.

an analysis of recently published open zfn sites in zebrafish  <cit>  illustrates the value of zifopt in reducing the experimental effort required to target a large number of genomic transcripts. in the previous study, at least one potential open nuclease site was identified within the first three coding exons in ~86% of zebrafish transcripts  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  using a classification threshold that corresponds to a confidence score >  <dig> for the active sites , zifopt predicts that  <dig>   of all zebrafish transcripts can be targeted successfully using open. by restricting targets to those identified by zifopt at a higher confidence score , the number of potential target sites for experimental testing could be reduced from  <dig>  to  <dig> , i.e., by ~ 90%. thus, for functional genomic studies, zifopt is a valuable tool for identifying sites most amenable to targeting by zfns. indeed, we have used zifopt to predict activity for all  <dig>  open zfn targets previously identified in zebrafish  <cit> . these results are presented in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>

discussion
detailed analyses of available high resolution structures for dna-protein complexes support the conclusion that there is no simple general code for dna-protein recognition  <cit> . for certain classes of dna binding proteins, including the c2h <dig> zinc finger proteins, it may be possible to decipher some of the rules that govern protein-dna recognition by exploiting the increasing availability of data regarding sequence determinants of binding affinity and specificity. for example, stormo's group has utilized contact propensities and weight matrices to predict which target sites a zinc finger motif is most likely to bind  <cit> . recently, singh and colleagues utilized svms to predict whether a specific zinc finger protein will bind a specified target site  <cit> . methods such as these utilize binding information for specific zfps interacting with a limited number of dna target sites. in contrast, dna microarray based experiments provide binding preferences of a transcription factor for thousands of potential sites  <cit> . these experiments should provide additional data for predicting and assessing transcription factor binding site models, including those for zinc finger proteins.

in the current study, we propose an approach for predicting whether a zfp can be engineered to bind a specific dna sequence without a priori knowledge of the zfp amino acid sequence. we analyzed base composition features and position-specific base propensities in a dataset of  <dig> different dna target sites for which the open selection method had been experimentally attempted. our goal was to use this information to develop a rapid and reliable machine learning classifier to identify dna sequences most amenable to site-specific targeting by zinc finger arrays generated using the open design procedure. based on our results, we developed a server-based application, zifopt, which implements a sequence identity-based naïve bayes classifier, and identifies active open target sites with an estimated accuracy of 87% and roc auc of  <dig> , when evaluated using cross-validation and optimized for correlation coefficient. zifopt performance on an independent test set of  <dig> experimentally validated zfp targets was lower in terms of auc , as expected, due to the more challenging nature of this performance test. importantly, confidence scores derived from posterior probabilities computed by zifopt are provided for each predicted zfp target site, allowing users to rank potential target sites and focus on those with the highest probability for success.

in our statistical analysis of active versus inactive target sites, we detected biases in position-specific base composition of zf targets . thus, we anticipated that classifiers in which we attempted to capture base count biases or position-specific base propensities in the sequence encoding might perform as well as those using sequence identity, particularly in light of the size of the dataset relative to the size of the feature space for the sequence identity representation. for the naïve bayes classifier, however, sequence identity outperformed positional base counts and gave the best overall performance, in terms of the auc of the roc curve . for the svm classifier, using positional base counts as input did provide substantially better performance than sequence identity . because the dataset used to train the svm classifiers was smaller , this difference in performance may be partly attributable to relatively sparse data for the sequence identity encoding.

although the open procedure tests only a small fraction of the total theoretical protein sequence space for the zinc finger recognition helix, it generates up to approximately  <dig> million zfp combinations, clustered in what are expected to correspond to regions of optimal amino acid sequence space for the dna target site of interest. together with the results summarized in figure  <dig>  this suggests there are utilizable constraints on the dna sequence space for 9-bp target sites that can be successfully targeted by zfps engineered by open. for example, the results in figures 1b and 1c indicate that increased thymine content in target sites, especially at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  may preclude high affinity or high specificity binding. previous studies have suggested that zfp recognition sites with a relatively high purine nucleotide content are more often active targets for engineered zinc finger proteins  <cit> . these earlier conclusions were based on analysis of target sites containing predominantly gnn-triplets and for zfps generated using modular assembly. the current analysis confirms and quantifies the contributions of high purine content as an important determinant of success for sequences targeted using open. more specifically, our analyses indicate that for three-finger zfps, it is advisable to avoid target sites containing many thymine bases.

based on the results reported here, zifopt will be valuable for guiding investigators using open to zfn target sites with the greatest opportunities for success. the calculations shown in table  <dig> illustrate the potential reduction in experimental effort that could be achieved by using zifopt to identify zfp target sites for every protein encoded by the zebrafish genome. also, zifopt should be valuable for selecting targets among the  <dig>  total open nuclease targets identified in protein-encoding transcripts of the human genome  , and could assist investigators who wish to apply open technology to target specific genes or genomic regions of interest in other organisms. zifopt classifies potential target sites for open-generated zfps as "active" or "inactive" and provides a confidence score for the prediction. zifopt is freely available and incorporated in the zinc finger targeter web server   <cit> . zifit can scan a given dna sequence of interest and identify every potential dna site targetable by open. with the integration of zifopt, users will be able to evaluate the expected success rate of open for target sites identified by zifit.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we developed machine learning classifiers that reliably identify dna sites highly amenable to targeting by the open zinc finger protein engineering method. analysis of a dataset of  <dig> experimentally validated zfp binding sites identified high thymine content as a significant barrier to effective targeting by open. in addition, comparison of results obtained using three different target sequence encodings as input for naïve bayes and svm classifiers suggested that positional context plays a significant role in zfp target site recognition. importantly, however, a simple encoding based on sequence identity is sufficient to identify the most promising zfp target sites, with ~87% accuracy. as more zfp functional data become available and we learn more about the sequence composition of fingers in open pools, our predictions should improve. at present, the zifopt classifier presented here is expected to reduce the experimental effort required to identify an active zfp-target site pair by ~75%, compared with selection of target sites without classification. by restricting experimental targets to "active" open sites predicted with highest confidence, experimental success rates should be significantly enhanced. this in turn should accelerate the application of zinc finger proteins as tools for precise genetic manipulation in basic genomics research as well as in gene therapy.
