BACKGROUND
phosphorus , one of the essential macronutrients, is required for several biochemical and physiological processes and is a component of key macromolecules including nucleic acids, atp and membrane phospholipids  <cit> . p is absorbed from rhizosphere as phosphate , which is often not easily available to plants due to its slow diffusion rates in soils and/or fixation as immobile organic pi  <cit> . limited pi availability adversely affects growth and development of plants  <cit> .

in arabidopsis thaliana, pi deficiency triggers progressive loss of meristematic activity in primary root tip thereby inhibiting primary root growth   <cit> . lpr <dig>  and its close paralog lpr <dig> , encoding multicopper oxidases , are major quantitative trait loci  associated with pi deficiency-mediated inhibition of prg  <cit> . loss-of-function mutations in lpr <dig> and lpr <dig> affect pi deficiency-mediated inhibition of prg  <cit> . however, unlike arabidopsis, pi deficiency either does not exert any significant effect on prg of taxonomically diverse dicots and monocots  <cit>  or triggeres augmented prg in rice  <cit> . these studies suggested that pi deficiency-mediated inhibition of prg is not a global response across different plant species. this raised an obvious question about the likely role of homologs of lpr1/ <dig> particularly in species such as rice in which pi deficiency has a rather contrasting influence on prg.

nuclear-localized siz <dig>  encodes a small ubiquitin-like modifier  e <dig> ligase <dig> and sumoylates transcription factor  phr <dig>  in arabidopsis  <cit> . phr <dig> plays a pivotal role in regulating the expression of pi 3starvation-responsive  genes whose promoters are enriched with phr1-binding sequence  motif  <cit> . phr <dig> is a pivotal upstream component of the pi sensing and signaling cascade comprising mir399s, ips <dig> , pho <dig> , spx <dig> , pi transporters pht1; <dig> ,pht1; <dig>  and a subset of other psr genes . interestingly though, promoters of both lpr <dig> and lpr <dig> do not have p1bs motif, which suggests a lack of any regulatory influence of phr <dig> on the expression of these genes. therefore, the identification of tfs that regulate lpr1/ <dig> solicits further studies.

rice, one of the most important cereal crops, feeds over one-third population of the world and sometimes is the only source of calories  <cit> . rice is often cultivated in rain-fed system on soils that are poor in pi availability, which affects its growth and development and consequently the yield potential  <cit> . therefore, it is increasingly becoming imperative to decipher the intricacies involved in the maintenance of pi homeostasis for developing rice with higher pi use efficiency for the sustainability of agriculture. pi starvation signal transduction pathway is highly conserved between arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . in this context, several homologs of arabidopsis in rice ie, osphr <dig>  <cit> , ospho <dig>  <cit> , osspx <dig> and osspx <dig>  <cit>  have been functionally characterized and are pivotal components of pi sensing and signaling cascade  <cit> . however, the roles of homologs of lpr1/ <dig> in rice during the maintenance of pi homeostasis have not been elucidated as yet.

in this study, the identification and expression analysis of oslpr1- <dig> in rice were carried out. phylogenetic analysis revealed their grouping into two distinct subclades. differential expression of these genes under both pi-replete and pi-deprived conditions and also under other nutrient deficiencies suggested functional divergence across them. further, analyses of the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig> in loss-of-function mutants  and transgenic rice overexpressing either osphr <dig> or osspx <dig> provided an insight into their potential roles in pi sensing and signaling cascade.

RESULTS
comparative structure analysis of lprs in arabidopsis and rice
protein sequences of arabidopsis lpr1- <dig> were used as queries by tblastn search in national center for biotechnology information  database, which identified five homologous genes in the rice genome and hereafter referred to as oslpr1- <dig>  details of their locus id, cdna accession number and protein characteristics are listed in additional file  <dig>  oslpr1- <dig> are localized closely within a range of 65 kb on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> . dnaman  <dig>  program was used for multi-sequence alignments of nucleotides and amino acids of lpr1- <dig> and oslpr1- <dig> and per cent identity matrices across them were determined . nucleotide equence identity  was 85 % between oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig> and  <dig>  % between oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig>  amino acid si was  <dig>  % between oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig> and  <dig>  % between oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig>  the analysis suggested a relative closeness of oslpr <dig> to oslpr <dig> and distant from oslpr <dig>  nucleotide si of lpr <dig> with oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig> were  <dig> and  <dig>  %, respectively. amino acid si varied from 57 % between oslpr <dig> and lpr <dig> to  <dig>  % between oslpr <dig> and lpr <dig>  this suggested that members of the oslpr family are phylogenetically more closely related to each other than to lprs. for comparative analysis of the number and position of exons and introns in lprs from rice and arabidopsis, their full-length cdna sequences were aligned with their corresponding genomic dna sequences . number of exons ranged from four , three  to two . in rice, the longest exon varied from 1446 bp in oslpr <dig> to 1551 bp in oslpr <dig>  while it was 1125 bp in both lpr1- <dig>  with a notable exception of oslpr <dig>  the last exon of lprs and oslprs was 54 bp in length. introns also exhibited variation in their number ranging from three , two  to one  with length varying from 70 bp in lpr <dig> to 6123 bp in oslpr <dig>  further, the 5' untranslated regions  of oslpr4/ <dig> were disrupted by an intron. the analysis thus revealed both the divergence and conservation of lpr genes in arabidopsis and rice.fig.  <dig> comparative identity matrices and gene structures of lpr genes in arabidopsis and rice. a dnaman  <dig>  program was used for multi-sequence alignments of nucleotides and amino acids for determining per cent identity matrices across them. b schematic representation of genes showing utr , cds  and introns  with numbers indicating length of each of them



phylogenetic analysis of lpr genes
lpr <dig> and lpr <dig> were used as queries in the blastp search on ncbi and plaza databases, which identified  <dig> lpr homologs from taxonomically diverse higher  and lower plants . an unrooted phylogenetic tree of all the homologs identified was reconstructed using mega  <dig>  using the neighbor-joining method . monocot lpr proteins grouped into clades a, b and c represented by yellow, red and purple lines, respectively, on the phylogenetic tree. except oslpr <dig>  oslpr <dig> and oslpr3- <dig> clubbed together in clade b with a closer evolutionary distance along with lprs from sorghum bicolor , setaria italic  and zea mays . grouping of oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig> in a distinct single sub-branch was consistent with their high nucleotide and amino acid si . in a single subclade, oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig> were inparalogs but outparalogs of oslpr1/2/ <dig>  oslpr <dig> was placed in clade a along with lprs from the members of the grass family ie, s. bicolor , z. mays , aegilop stauschii , triticum urartu , hordeum vulgare  and brachypodium distachyon . orthologs of oslpr1/2/ <dig> were also found in other monocot species. the clade c comprising lprs from b. distachyon , z. mays  and s. bicolor  revealed long evolutionary distance from both clades a and b. although all the lprs from dicots formed a distinct clade , notable exception was the placement of lpr from manihot esculenta   between clades a and b. both atlpr <dig> and atlpr <dig> exhibited close phylogenetic relationships with lprs from capsella rubella . lprs from gymnosperm , bryophyte  and algae  grouped in grey clade. it is apparent from this phylogenetic analysis that lprs in monocotyledonous species are closely related suggesting a likely duplication event preceding the split between monocots and dicots. on the contrary, lpr paralogs in dicotyledonous species were closely related indicating duplication following the split between monocots and dicots. therefore, it could be assumed that oslprs may have functions similar to orthologs from other monocotyledonous species but different from lprs in dicotyledonous species including arabidopsis. overall, the analysis revealed the conservation of lprs across taxonomically diverse higher and lower plant species.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of lpr gene family in plants. joint unrooted phylogenetic tree of  <dig> putative lpr genes from  <dig> different higher and lower plant species representing dicots , monocots , gymnosperms , bryophytes  and algae . * and † represent species that have been sequenced and not sequenced as yet, respectively



cu-oxidase domain analysis of lpr proteins in rice
multicopper oxidase  facilitates oxidation of organic or metal ions, and trinuclear cu cluster  is involved in the reduction of o <dig>  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mco activity of lpr proteins is pivotal for eliciting inhibition of primary root growth during pi deficiency  <cit> . pfam and ncbi protein databases  were employed for the analysis of the domain structures of cu-oxidase 1– <dig> and peroxidase in lpr proteins of higher and lower plant species that have been sequenced . the analysis revealed significant differences in sizes and positions of cu-oxidase 1– <dig> and peroxidase domains of putative lpr proteins of b. distachyon , z. mays  and s. bicolor  compared with other lpr proteins. further, cu-oxidase domains were analyzed in oslpr proteins . cu-oxidase domains i, ii and iii were detected in oslpr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with a notable absence of cu-oxidase i domain in oslpr <dig>  full-length deduced polypeptides of lpr proteins comprised 535– <dig> amino acids. clustal x and dnaman  <dig>  programs were used for multiple-sequence alignment of amino acids of cu-oxidase i, ii and iii domains of oslpr proteins . the number of amino acids in cu-oxidase i, ii and iii across oslprs were 74– <dig>  77– <dig> and 123– <dig>  respectively. the analysis revealed significant conservation across all three domains of cu-oxidase in oslprs, which is critical for the maintenance of their optimal efficacy. michigan state university  rice database  search resulted in the identification of another  <dig> genes , which are represented by three cu-oxidase domains. mega  <dig>  was used for reconstructing an un-rooted dendrogram revealing phylogenetic relationship across these genes . the analysis revealed a relative closeness of oslprs to the members of mono-copper oxidase subfamily. on the contrary, n-terminal regions of oslpr proteins in arabidopsis and rice showed a rather low per cent identity .fig.  <dig> analysis of cu-oxidase domain structure of lpr proteins in rice. a cu-oxidase i, ii and iii domains in oslpr proteins are indicated by elliptic, rectangle and rounded rectangle, respectively. number indicates length of oslpr protein. b alignment of amino acid sequences of cu-oxidase i, ii and iii domains of lpr proteins in rice. identical and similar amino acids across lpr proteins are highlighted with dark and light grey backgrounds, respectively. consensus sequences determined by weblogo  are presented at the bottom



tissue-specific expression profiles of oslprs
to determine the spatiotemporal expression pattern of oslprs, qrt-pcr was performed at seedling  and flowering  stages . at seedling stage, different tissues  were examined. although expression of oslpr <dig> was detected in all the tissues of the seedlings examined, its level was significantly higher in root zone ii compared with other tissues. on the contrary, expression levels of oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig> were largely detected in root zones and basal stem with relatively low or barely detectable expression levels in leaf blades and leaf sheaths. expression of oslpr <dig> was also relatively higher in basal stem and root zones compared with leaf sheath and leaf blade. high expression levels of oslpr1/3/4/ <dig> in roots suggested their potential roles in acquisition of nutrients by roots from the rhizosphere. the expression of oslpr <dig> was significantly higher in 2nd and 4th leaf blades, moderate in 1st leaf blade, 4th leaf sheath and root zone ii, and low in 2nd leaf sheath, basal stem and root zone i. this suggested a likely role of oslpr <dig> in mobilization of nutrients to shoot. at flowering stage, the expression pattern of oslprs was examined in flag leaf blade, lower leaf blade, flag leaf sheath, lower leaf sheath, culm, node and panicle axis. although low expression of oslpr <dig> was detected in lower leaf blade and panicle axis, it could barely be observed in other tissues. oslpr <dig> showed high transcript levels in flag and lower leaf blade, low transcript levels in leaf sheath  and culm and was not detected in node and panicle axis. the expression of oslpr <dig> was relatively higher in lower leaf blade and lower leaf sheath compared with other tissues, while that of oslpr <dig> was significantly higher in panicle axis compared with lower leaf sheath, culm and node and remained undetected in flag leaf blade, lower leaf blade and flag leaf sheath. in the case of oslpr <dig>  the expression pattern revealed a trend similar to oslpr <dig> with a significantly higher level in panicle axis compared with other tissues. pht1; <dig> , one of the  <dig> pht <dig> pi transporters in rice, expressed abundantly and constitutively in various cell types of both roots and shoots . therefore, ospt <dig> was used as a positive control for determining the relative expression levels of all the members of oslpr family in different tissues of 21-d-old rice seedling . overall, the relative expression levels of different members of oslpr family were higher at the seedling stage compared with flowering stage. the results suggested potentially different roles of the members of oslprs in a tissue- and development-specific manner. functional divergence is also prevalent across the members of ospts  and osspxs  gene families in rice  <cit> .fig.  <dig> differential tissue-specific expression of oslprs. tissues were collected at seedling  and flowering  stages. at seedling stage, leaf blades were named as 1st to 4th from top to base. root zones i and ii represented 1 cm and >1 cm from root tip, respectively. sheath related to each blade were numbered 2nd to 5th with 1st leaf blade being wrapped in 2nd leaf. during flowing stage, 3rd blade from top to base represented lower blade. qrt-pcr was used for determining the relative expression levels of oslprs. actin  was used as an internal control. values are means ± se  and different letters indicate that the values differ significantly 



nutrient deficiencies affect the expression profiles of oslprs
rice seedlings  were grown for  <dig> d in complete nutrient solution  and in nutrient solution deprived of one of the nutrients ie, pi, nitrogen , potassium , magnesium  and iron . roots of these seedlings were assayed for the relative expression levels of oslprs by qrt-pcr . compared with c, relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> were significantly induced under –k and –fe conditions, attenuated under –p condition and remained unaffected under –n and –mg conditions. although –k triggered a significant increase in the relative expression level of oslpr <dig>  other nutrient deficiencies did not exert any significant influence on its expression level compared with c. relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> were significantly induced under –p and –k conditions, reduced under –n condition and was unaffected under –mg and –fe conditions compared with c. relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> were elevated under –p and –k conditions but other nutrient deficiencies did not exert any significant influence on its expression level compared with c. relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> increased under –p and –fe conditions, decreased under –n condition and remained comparable with c under –k and –mg conditions. the analysis revealed variable effects of different nutrient deficiencies on the expression levels of oslprs. among different nutrient deficiencies, pi deficiency revealed wide spectrum effects ranging from induction , attenuation  and no influence  on the relative expression level of these genes. this suggested their potentially variable and specific roles in regulating pi homeostasis in rice. in arabidopsis, lpr <dig> has been shown to play a pivotal role in inhibition of primary root growth in response to sensing local pi deprivation  <cit> . however, unlike taproot system in arabidopsis, rice has a fibrous root system  <cit>  and deficiency of pi triggers its elongation  <cit> . this raised a pertinent question about a likely role, if any, of any of the pi-responsive members of oslprs in pi deficiency-mediated developmental responses of rice root system. analysis of their loss-of-function mutants could provide a better insight, which requires further comprehensive studies. variable responses to pi deficiency have also been reported for members of gene family with spx  domain, which are designated as osspx1- <dig>  among these, osspx  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> are responsive to pi starvation  <cit> . although osspx <dig> is not responsive to pi deficiency, spx <dig> interacts with osphr <dig> and negatively regulates pi signaling and homeostasis  <cit> . in this context, non-responsiveness of oslpr <dig> to pi deficiency may not completely rule out its role in pi sensing and signaling cascade. increase in the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig> under both –p and –k conditions suggested cross talk between these two nutrients. a similar cross talk between p and k was also observed in soybean in which several members of gmpts, a pht <dig> gene family encoding pi transporters, were upregulated by both p and k deficiencies  <cit> . in another study, a high-density array comprising  <dig>  genes from tomato roots revealed coordinated and coregulation of genes encoding transporters of pi and k when deprived of either pi or k  <cit> . furthermore, microarray analysis of the global pi deficiency response in arabidopsis revealed significant induction in the expression levels of several genes  encoding different k transporters  <cit> . suppression and induction in the relative expression of oslpr <dig> under –p and –fe conditions, respectively suggested their antagonistic effects on this gene. the result was consistent with an earlier study, which showed that availability of pi exerted significant influence on the regulation of fe-responsive genes in rice  <cit> . further, availability of fe also affects pi deficiency-mediated morphophysiological and molecular responses in arabidopsis . these studies thus provided evidences of a cross talk between pi and fe in both rice and arabidopsis. on the contrary, −n either exerted attenuating  or no effect  on the relative expression levels of different members of oslprs. increases in the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig> under –p condition and their suppression under –n condition suggested an incidence of an antagonistic cross talk between these two nutrients in rice. a similar antagonistic cross talk between these two nutrients was evident in rice for a gene encoding sulfate transporter  <dig>  , which was up- and down-regulated in response to –p and –n conditions, respectively  <cit> . there are also growing evidences toward the interactions between p and n signaling pathways in arabidopsis . overall, the study revealed the cross talk across different nutrients, which exerts regulatory influence on oslpr family members. it is consistent with well established dogma that deficiency of one nutrient can cause imbalance of other nutrients and thereby their related morphophysiological and molecular responses  <cit> . on the contrary, expression levels of all the members of oslprs were not affected during mg deficiency.fig.  <dig> different nutrient deficiencies exert variable effects on the expression of oslprs in roots. rice seedlings  were grown in complete nutrient solution  and in nutrient solution deprived of one of the nutrients ie, pi, n, k, mg or fe for  <dig> d. qrt-pcr was used for determinin g the relative expression levels of oslprs in roots. actin was used as an internal control. values are means ± se  and different letters indicate that the values differ significantly 



phosphite represses oslpr3/ <dig> responses to pi deficiency in rice
phosphite  is a non-metabolizable analog of pi. phi is taken up by plant through pi transporters, mimics pi to some extent, interferes with pi signaling and have been shown to suppress the coordinated expression of psr genes in arabidopsis . phi is thus a potent tool for determining whether a gene is a component of a sensing and signaling network that governs pi homeostasis. therefore, to compare the effects of phi and pi deficiency treatments on the relative expression levels of oslpr3/ <dig> in roots, rice seedlings  were grown under + pi , −pi  and + phi/–pi  conditions for  <dig> d . there were significant increases in the relative expression levels of both oslpr3/ <dig> in roots of –pi seedlings compared with + pi seedlings. however, the relative expression levels of these genes in + phi/–pi roots were significantly attenuated and became almost comparable with + p seedlings. the results provided evidence towards the involvement of oslpr3/ <dig> in pi deficiency-mediated signal transduction. the results were consistent with an earlier study reporting attenuation in the expression of pi starvation-induced osips <dig> and osips <dig> in rice upon long-term exposure to phi  <cit> . as anticipated, there were significant reductions in the contents of pi and total p in root and shoot of –pi seedlings compared with + pi seedlings . significant reductions in the contents of pi  and total p  were also observed in + phi/–pi seedlings and the values were comparable with –pi seedlings. this suggested that + phi/–pi and –pi treatments treatment exerted similar attenuating influence on pi content and total p. notably though, total p content in + phi/–pi roots was significantly lower and higher compared with + pi and –pi roots, respectively. the results thus suggested partial influence of phi on sensing and signaling cascade governing pi homeostasis.fig.  <dig> phosphite represses the responses of oslpr3/ <dig> to pi deficiency. rice seedlings  were grown under + pi , −pi  and + phi/–pi  conditions for  <dig> d. a qrt-pcr was used for determining the relative expression levels of oslpr3/ <dig> in the roots. actin was used as an internal control. data are presented for b pi content and c total p and values are means ± se  with different letters indicating values that differ significantly 



short- and long-term effects of pi deficiency on the expression profiles of oslprs in the roots
rice seedlings  were subjected to + pi and –pi conditions for different time intervals  and subsequently replenished with + pi  after –pi  treatment. an earlier study had reported complete pi starvation of rice seedlings after  <dig> d of –pi treatment  <cit> . high affinity pi transporter ospt <dig> is induced rapidly and sustains induction in both roots and shoots during –pi treatment  <cit> . therefore, ospt <dig> is a potent gene for validating the fidelity of the growth conditions used for growing rice seedlings under + pi and –pi conditions. qrt-pcr was employed for determining the relative expression levels of oslprs  and ospt <dig> in the roots of seedlings grown under + pi and –pi conditions for different time intervals and upon replenishment with + pi . relative expression levels of ospt <dig> induced rapidly during short-term  –pi treatment, augmented commensurately during longer durations of this treatment and attenuated rapidly upon replenishment of –pi  seedlings with + pi . the results provided evidence towards the efficacy of the growth condition being employed in the present study for determining the temporal effects of –pi condition on the relative expression profiles of the members of oslprs. compared with + pi, the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> were significantly attenuated during –pi treatments for 6 h,  <dig> d and  <dig> d and induced significantly upon replenishment with + pi. on the contrary, there was a significant increase in the relative expression level of oslpr <dig> during short-term  –pi treatment and its relative expression levels increased concomitantly with an increase in the duration of this treatment compared with + pi. although relative expression level of oslpr <dig> after short-term  –pi treatment was comparable with + pi, its levels increased significantly during prolonged  –pi treatments exhibiting a trend similar to oslpr <dig>  many of the psr genes are known to be induced transiently during short-term –pi treatment  <cit> . on the contrary, inductions in the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> and  <dig> during short-term  –pi treatment were not transient. in a global microarray analysis of spatiotemporal –pi responses of arabidopsis, several psr genes involved in pi acquisition , mobilization , phospholipid substitution  and root development  also showed a similar pattern of early and sustained induction. there were significant reductions in the relative expression levels of both oslpr <dig> and  <dig> in the roots of –pi  seedlings upon replenishment with + pi . this provided evidence towards their transcriptional regulation by pi availability and their potential roles in the maintenance of pi homeostasis. although there were significant increases in the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> during long-term  –pi treatments compared with + pi, subsequent replenishment with + pi did not exert any attenuating effect on its elevated relative expression level. this suggested an unlikely role of pi in the transcriptional regulation of oslpr <dig>  overall, differential relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> during temporal –pi treatments and after replenishment with + pi suggested their specific roles in pi sensing and signaling cascades. it is not surprising because members of a gene family often exhibit lack of functional redundancy. for instance, members of pi transporter family  in rice exhibit variable responses to –pi condition and play diverse roles in maintaining pi homeostasis .fig.  <dig> short-and long-term effects of pi deprivation on the expression of oslprs in roots. rice seedlings  were grown under + p  and -p  conditions for 6 h,  <dig> d,  <dig> d,  <dig> d and  <dig> d. after  <dig> d of treatment, half of -p plants were replenished with + p for  <dig> d. qrt-pcr was used for determining the relative expression levels of oslprs  in root samples. effects of pi deprivation on their relative expression levels were also compared with pi deficiency-induced high affinity pi transporter ospt <dig>  actin was used as an internal control. values are means ± se  and asterisk indicates that the values for -p differ significantly  compared with + p



split-root experiment revealed the effect of systemic pi sensing on the relative expression levels of oslpr3/5
split-root experiment in which each half of the intact root system remains in contact with a different nutrient medium is an attractive technique for determining whether psr genes are regulated by external pi availability  or by internal pi status of the whole plant   <cit> . in arabidopsis, using this technique, an array of psr genes were identified that were specifically regulated either by local or systemic pi sensing  <cit> . therefore, in the present study, this technique was employed for determining the effects of local and systemic pi sensing on the relative expression levels of oslpr3/ <dig> and total p content in the root of rice seedlings . in a hydroponic system, both halves of rice root were submerged either in + p  or –pi  to mimic control plants growing in a homogeneous medium and hereafter referred as c + p and c –p, respectively. in another set-up, each half of the intact root system was placed in + p and –pi nutrient media and referred to as sp + p and sp –p, respectively. qrt-pcr was employed for determining the relative expression levels of oslpr3/ <dig> in the roots of the seedlings grown under c + p, c –p, sp + p and sp –p conditions . as anticipated, relative expression levels of oslpr3/ <dig> were significantly higher in the roots of c –p compared with c + p. however, there were significant attenuations in their relative expression levels in sp –p roots compared with c –p and the values were almost comparable with c + p. relative expression levels of oslpr3/ <dig> were comparable in c + p and sp + p roots. this clearly suggested that despite the presence of sp –p roots in –pi medium, the expression levels of oslpr3/ <dig> were regulated systemically by whole plant pi status. the results were contrary to an earlier study in arabidopsis in which lpr <dig> and lpr <dig> were shown to play pivotal roles in local pi sensing-mediated responses of prg  <cit> . this suggested functional divergence of lpr family in taxonomically diverse arabidopsis and rice. root tissues were also analyzed for the total p content . total p content was highest and lowest in c + p and c –p roots, respectively. interestingly though, differences in the total p content in sp + p and sp –p were statistically insignificant. variable total p content in these root tissues correlated with the oslpr3/ <dig> expression levels in them.fig.  <dig> relative expression of oslpr3/ <dig> and total p concentration in split-root experiment. intact roots of rice seedlings were divided into two halves with one half placed in 300 μm pi  and another half in 0 μm pi . as controls, both halves were grown under 300 μm pi  and 0 μm pi . a qrt-pcr was used for determining the relative expression levels of oslpr3/ <dig> in the roots. actin was used as an internal control. b total p content. values are means ± se  with different letters indicating values that differ significantly 



oslpr3/ <dig> are negatively regulated by osphr <dig> and are influenced by siz1/pho2/spx1-mediated pi sensing
in rice, several transcription factors  have been identified that play pivotal roles in the transcriptional regulation of psr genes  <cit> . among these tfs, osphr <dig> is expressed constitutively under different pi regime and has been implicated in regulating pi signaling and homeostasis  <cit> . to determine whether osphr <dig> exerts any regulatory influence on oslprs, their relative expression levels were assayed in the roots of the wildtype  and osphr <dig> seedlings grown under + p and –p conditions . there were significant increases in the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> and  <dig> in the roots of osphr <dig> under both + p and –p conditions compared with their corresponding wild types. however, marginal but significant increase in the relative expression of oslpr <dig> was detected in the roots of osphr <dig> compared with the wild type only under + p condition. further, relative expression levels of oslpr3/4/ <dig> were compared in + p and –p roots of osphr2-ox plants and their corresponding wild types . although relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig> were significantly attenuated in + p and –p roots of osphr2-ox plants compared with their corresponding wild types, no such effect was detected in the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig>  this suggested a more pronounced negative regulatory influence of osphr <dig> on the expression of oslpr <dig> and  <dig> than on oslpr <dig>  interestingly though, the promoter of oslpr <dig> is enriched with p1bs motif, while those of other oslprs  are enriched with w-box motif . in a global microarray analysis of pi deficiency responses in arabidopsis, promoters of the psr genes were analyzed for the presence of p1bs motif  <cit> . the analysis revealed enrichment of the promoters of several psr genes with p1bs motif. in addition, several genes were also identified that were not induced under –p condition despite the presence of this motif. for instance, promoters of genes encoding purple acid phosphatase   <dig>  and  <dig>  are enriched with  <dig> p1bs motifs each but neither of them shows any induction during pi deficiency. in this context, it is not surprising to observe lack of any significant effect of either mutation  or overexpression  of osphr <dig> on the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig>  however, lack of p1bs motif on the promoters of oslpr3/ <dig> suggested their negative regulation by osphr <dig> by possibly invoking a feed-forward regulatory loop . in arabidopsis, tfs nam/ataf1/2/cuc <dig>  and nac-like, activated by ap3/pi  repress the transcription of abscisic acid-responsive element binding protein <dig>  through a ffrl  <cit> . presence of two w-box in the promoter of oslpr <dig>  suggested a likely regulatory influence of wrky tfs. in rice, wrky tf superfamily comprises  <dig> members  <cit> . recent study has shown the role of oswrky <dig> in regulating pi homeostasis  <cit> . therefore, it would be intriguing to investigate whether oswrky <dig> and osphr <dig> regulate oslpr <dig> in a ffrl, which warrants further studies.fig.  <dig>

transcript levels of osspx <dig> induced in –p root and stem and also in osphr2-ox plants suggesting the former to be downstream of the latter  <cit> . another study demonstrated the inhibition in the activity of osphr <dig> by osspx <dig> in a pi-dependent manner  <cit> . together these studies suggested a negative feedback loop regulation of osphr <dig> by osspx <dig>  since the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig> were significantly increased in osphr <dig> under both + p and –p conditions , a similar expression pattern was anticipated in spx1-ox. consistent with this assumption, significant increases in the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig> were observed in spx1-ox under both + p and –p conditions compared with their corresponding wild types . on the contrary, relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> in spx1-ox  were comparable with the wild type. this suggested that oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig> are part of osphr2-osspx1-mediated regulation of pi homeostasis.

ospho <dig>  a signaling component downstream of osphr <dig>  plays a key role in regulating the expression of ospts and multiple pi starvation responses thereby influencing pi utilization in rice  <cit> . therefore, the regulatory influence of ospho <dig> on oslpr3- <dig> was investigated . there were significant increases in the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> in pho2- <dig> and pho2- <dig> compared with the wild type. an increased expression of osspx <dig> in the roots of pho <dig> mutant suggested a negative regulatory influence of ospho <dig> on its downstream osspx <dig>  <cit> . the accentuated relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> in spx1-ox  and pho2- <dig> and pho2- <dig>  thus suggested it to be downstream of osphr2-ospho2-osspx <dig> pathway. on the contrary, significant reductions and no effect on the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig>  respectively in pho2- <dig> and pho2- <dig> compared with the wild type  highlighted differential roles of the members of oslpr family in osphr2-ospho2-osspx1-mediated pi sensing.

sumoylation is a critical post-translational modification involved in protein-protein interaction, transcriptional activation and localization of proteins  <cit> . ossiz <dig> and ossiz <dig>  homologs of arabidopsis siz <dig> in rice, partially complemented the morphological phenotype of siz1- <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . further, several genes involved in pi sensing and signaling were modulated in ossiz <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the effects of ossiz <dig> on the regulation of oslpr3- <dig>  were assayed . significant reductions were observed in the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig> in both siz1- <dig> and siz1- <dig> compared with the wild-type. although marginal reductions in the expression levels of oslpr <dig> were also detected in these mutants, the values were statistically insignificant. this suggested a post-translational regulatory influence of ossiz <dig> on oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig>  however, at present it is not known whether ossiz <dig> exerts direct regulatory influence on oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig> by sumoylating them or mediated through a target, which is yet to be identified. functional characterization of oslprs could provide an insight into their specific roles in maintaining pi homeostasis and thus warrants further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presented a detailed genome-wide analysis of the gene structure, phylogenetic evolution and tissue-specific expression patterns of lpr family members in rice . phylogenetic analysis revealed their grouping into two distinct subclades. differential expression of these genes under deficiencies of pi and other nutrients suggested lack of functional redundancy across them. further an insight into the likely roles of oslpr <dig> and oslpr <dig> in the maintenance of pi homeostasis was gained by assaying their relative expression levels in loss-of-function mutants  and transgenic rice overexpressing either osphr <dig> or osspx <dig>  the results from this study thus provide a basis for further detailed functional characterization of different members of oslpr family for elucidation of their specific roles in maintaining homeostasis during deficiency of pi and/or other nutrients.
