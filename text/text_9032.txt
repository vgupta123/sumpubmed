BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  is one of the most economically important infectious diseases of swine worldwide. the annual loss associated with prrs to the united states swine industry has been estimated to be approximately  <dig> million usd  <cit> . prrs virus , the etiological agent of prrs, is classified as a member of the arteriviridae virus family, along with equine arteritis virus , lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus  of mice, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus , and belongs to the order nidovirales  <cit> . prrsv is a small, enveloped virus that contains a single-stranded, non-segmented, positive-sense rna genome approximately 15 kb in length. the prrsv genome encodes at least ten open reading frames  designated as orf1a, orf1b, orf2a, orf2b, orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf5a, orf <dig>  orf <dig>  and orf <dig>  <cit> . because prrsv evolves very quickly  <cit> , there is a great deal of genetic variability among prrsv strains. in general, prrsv strains are grouped into european  and north american  genotypes  <cit> , but high levels of genetic variability still exist among viruses, even within the same genotype  <cit> , which results in suboptimal cross-protection between different prrsv strains and becomes a significant impediment to the development of effective vaccines. modified live virus  vaccines have been most commonly used to control prrsv because they confer better protection against homologous virus strains compared to inactivated or recombinant vaccines  <cit> . however, there have been serious safety concerns about using these mlv vaccines because they quickly revert to virulence during serial passages in pigs  <cit> . therefore, it is important to develop a new strategy to stabilize the prrsv genome during virus replication for the purpose of vaccine safety.

previously, a number of nucleoside analogs, including ribavirin   <cit> , 5-fluorouracil   <cit> , and 5-azacytidine   <cit> , have been shown to be mutagenic, antiviral compounds that are effective against various rna viruses, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus , poliovirus, and hepatitis c virus . these mutagens increase the mutation frequency of rna viruses above a tolerable error threshold during replication, ultimately driving viral infection into extinction  <cit> . amiloride hydrochloride hydrate  is another antiviral drug with efficacy against many rna viruses, including rhinovirus, coxsackievirus b <dig> , coronaviruses, flaviviruses, and retroviruses  <cit> . moreover, it has been demonstrated that amiloride increases the mutation frequency of rna viruses, in addition to its other antiviral activities  <cit> . it has also been demonstrated that mutant viruses that emerged following sequential passages of hcv, cvb <dig>  poliovirus, and fmdv  <cit>  in the presence of ribavirin had higher genetic stability than wild-type viruses. therefore, this strategy was employed to select a mutagen-resistant strain of prrsv that would have higher genetic stability. in the current study, the effects of four mutagens  on prrsv replication in marc- <dig> cells were evaluated to select the mutagen that is most effective against prrsv. then, mutagen-resistant viruses were rescued after sequential passages in the presence of the mutagen and were evaluated for their genetic stability during additional sequential passages in cell culture systems.

methods
antiviral mutagens
ribavirin , 5-fluorouracil , 5-azacytidine , and amiloride  were used in this study. all of these mutagens were dissolved in rpmi- <dig> medium  at stock concentrations of 15 mm  and 20 mm , sterile-filtered using a  <dig> -μm syringe filter, aliquoted, and stored at −20°c until use.

virus and cell culture
vr <dig>  a prototype strain of prrsv type  <dig>  was used in the study. marc- <dig>  an african green monkey kidney cell line highly permissive to prrsv infection, was used for prrsv propagation and antiviral assays. marc- <dig> cells were maintained in rpmi- <dig> medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum , 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100× antibiotic-antimycotic solution   at 37°c in a humidified 5% co <dig> atmosphere.

evaluation of effects of mutagens on prrsv replication
confluent monolayers of marc- <dig> cells were prepared in 25-cm <dig> flasks and were inoculated with vr <dig> at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig> . after incubation for 1 hour in a humidified 5% co <dig> incubator at 37°c, the virus inoculum was removed, and the cell monolayer was replenished with rpmi growth medium containing one of the antiviral mutagens. ribavirin, 5-fluorouracil, and amiloride were evaluated at six different concentrations , while 5-azactytidine was evaluated at ten different concentrations , based on previous reports  <cit> . the treated flasks were then incubated for four more days under the same culture conditions described above, during which time cell culture medium was collected from each flask every 24 hours, centrifuged, and stored at −80°c until analysis.

virus titration assay
progeny virus titers were determined using a microtitration infectivity assay  <cit> . in brief, up to  <dig>  10-fold serial dilutions of samples were prepared. confluent monolayers of marc- <dig> cells prepared in 96-well plates were inoculated in quadruplicate with 100 μl of each sample and were incubated for 1 hour under the same culture conditions described above. after incubation, the inoculum was discarded, and the cell monolayer was replenished with rpmi growth medium. the plates were then incubated for an additional six days and monitored for cytopathic effects  daily. the titer of each virus sample was calculated based on cpe and was expressed as a 50% tissue culture infective dose /ml  <cit> .

cytotoxicity assay
a commercially available cytotoxicity assay kit  was used to assess the cytotoxic effects of the four antiviral mutagens in marc- <dig> cells. in short, the cytotox-glo™ assay measures a distinct protease  activity associated with cytotoxicity  <cit> . the assay uses a luminogenic peptide substrate  to measure the activity of dead-cell protease released from cells that have lost membrane integrity. to determine the cytotoxicities of the mutagens, confluent monolayers of marc- <dig> cells were prepared in 25-cm <dig> flasks. after rinsing, the cells were replenished with rpmi growth medium containing one of the mutagens at one of four different concentrations  and further incubated under the culture conditions described above. supernatants were collected from each flask every 12 hours for up to 48 hours, and the levels of luminescence  generated from the cleavage of luminogenic aaf-glo™ substrate by protease in the collected supernatants were measured to determine the cytotoxicity levels induced by each mutagen according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

serial passages of prrsv in marc- <dig> cells in the presence of ribavirin
vr <dig> was serially passaged in cell culture in the presence of  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig>  mm ribavirin to study the emergence of ribavirin-resistant prrsv mutants. confluent monolayers of marc- <dig> cells were prepared in 6-well plates and pre-treated with rpmi growth medium containing ribavirin for 7 hours prior to infection at 37°c. after the pre-treatment incubation, cells were inoculated with vr <dig> at an moi of  <dig> . after incubation for 1 hour, virus inoculum was removed, and cells were replenished with rpmi growth medium containing the same concentrations of ribavirin as described above for post-treatment. the infection was then allowed to proceed for 24 hours, after which the cell culture fluid was collected from each well, centrifuged, and stored at −80°c until use. the supernatant from each passage became the inoculum for the next passage. this procedure was repeated a total of  <dig> times.

assessment of growth kinetics for ribavirin-resistant mutants in the presence of ribavirin at several concentrations using multi-step growth curve analysis
the growth competencies of two ribavirin-resistant candidate mutants  were assessed in marc- <dig> cells in the presence of ribavirin, compared to vr <dig> in the presence of ribavirin. confluent monolayers of marc- <dig> cells were prepared in 25-cm <dig> flasks, inoculated with each virus at an moi of  <dig> , and incubated for 1 hour under the same conditions described above. after incubation, the inoculum was discarded, and cells were replenished with rpmi- <dig> growth medium containing several concentrations  of ribavirin. the treated flasks were then incubated for  <dig> more days. supernatants were collected from each flask every 24 hours, and the virus in these supernatants was titered.

assessment of genetic stability of ribavirin-resistant mutants during passages in marc- <dig> cells
to assess the genetic stability of the ribavirin-resistant mutants  that arose from sequential passages of vr <dig> in the presence of ribavirin as described above, the mutant viruses were passaged  <dig> more times, along with vr <dig>  plaque purification was performed using each strain to achieve a highly homogenous virus clone, as described previously  <cit> . for each passage, confluent marc- <dig> cell monolayer prepared in 6-well plates were inoculated with each virus strain and incubated for 1 hour. after incubation, the cells were replenished with rpmi growth medium and incubated for 24 hours. then, supernatants were collected and used for the next passage of cells. this procedure was repeated  <dig> times.

plaque purification was conducted on the supernatants collected after  <dig> passages to isolate  <dig> plaque clones per viral strain. viral rna was extracted from each virus clone using a commercial kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. nsp <dig> and orf <dig>  which are known to be the most variable regions in the prrsv genome  <cit> , were amplified with a one-step rt-pcr kit  and were submitted for sequencing . pcr amplification and sequencing primers are shown in table  <dig> table  <dig>

RESULTS
effects of antiviral mutagens on in vitro prrsv replication
the effects of the four antiviral mutagens studied on prrsv replication are summarized in figure  <dig>  the rate of vr <dig> replication in marc- <dig> cells decreased more than 100-fold in the presence of  <dig>  mm ribavirin and was completely suppressed at concentrations of ribavirin higher than  <dig>  mm. despite the efficient antiviral effect of ribavirin at low concentrations, no significant cytotoxicity was observed, even at the highest concentration  of ribavirin studied, up to 48 hours post-treatment {figure  <dig> }. similarly, 5-fluorouracil suppressed vr <dig> replication in a dose-dependent manner: the rate of vr <dig> replication decreased approximately 100-fold or more than 1000-fold in the presence of  <dig>  or 1 mm 5-fluorouracil, respectively. no significant cytotoxicity was observed with up to  <dig>  mm 5-fluorouracil {figure  <dig> }. however, significant levels of cytotoxicity were observed with  <dig> and  <dig>  mm azacytidine at 48 hours post-treatment, although vr <dig> replication was significantly suppressed when at least  <dig>  mm 5-azacytidine was included in the culture medium {figure  <dig> }. no significant antiviral activity against vr <dig> was measured at low concentrations  of 5-azacytidine . similarly, high concentrations  of amiloride also caused significant cytotoxicity in marc- <dig> cells after 36 hours post-treatment {figure  <dig> }; however, vr <dig> replication was suppressed by amiloride in a dose-dependent manner and was completely suppressed by more than  <dig>  mm amiloride {figure  <dig> }. based on these results, ribavirin was selected for further experiments because it was most effective at suppressing prrsv replication without causing significant cytotoxicity in marc- <dig> cells.figure  <dig>

emergence of ribavirin-resistant mutants after serial passage of prrsv in marc- <dig> cells in the presence of ribavirin
vr <dig> was serially passaged in marc- <dig> cells in the presence of ribavirin at concentrations of  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  mm. although  <dig>  mm ribavirin failed to mediate significant suppression of vr <dig> replication, concentrations of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm ribavirin were able to suppress virus replication to undetectable levels based on a virus titration assay at passage  <dig>  however, virus replication started to resume at passages  <dig> and  <dig> in the presence of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm ribavirin, respectively. the reemerging viruses maintained increasing progeny virus production in successive passages, and two virus strains, rvrp <dig> and rvrp <dig>  were recovered at passages  <dig> and  <dig> in the presence of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm ribavirin, respectively. ribavirin doses greater than or equal to  <dig>  mm completely suppressed the replication of vr <dig> below the detection limit of the virus titration assay for all  <dig> passages .figure  <dig>

higher genetic stability of ribavirin-resistant mutants after serial passages in marc- <dig> cells
the ribavirin-resistant mutants, rvrp <dig> and rvrp <dig>  and vr <dig> were plaque-purified and designated as rvrp13-p, rvrp22-p, and vr2332-p, respectively. the plaque-purified viruses were then serially passaged  <dig> times in marc- <dig> cells without ribavirin. after  <dig> passages,  <dig> virus clones were rescued from each supernatant by plaque purification for each virus strain, and the hypervariable regions  of the  <dig> virus clones were amplified for sequencing. as summarized in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  rvrp13-p and rvrp22-p exhibited lower mutation frequencies than vr2332-p after  <dig> sequential passages in marc- <dig> cells:  <dig> nucleotide and  <dig> amino acid substitutions were identified in the nsp <dig> region of vr2332-p, whereas rvrp13-p had  <dig> nucleotide  and  <dig> amino acid substitutions  and rvrp22-p had  <dig> nucleotide  and  <dig> amino acid substitutions  in the same region {figure  <dig> }. in orf <dig>  both rvrp13-p and vr23323-p had similar mutation frequencies, with  <dig> nucleotide and  <dig> amino acid substitutions for rvrp13-p and  <dig> nucleotide and  <dig> amino acid substitutions for vr23323-p. in contrast, rvrp22-p had a much lower  mutation frequency, accumulating only  <dig> nucleotide and  <dig> amino acid substitutions {figure  <dig> }.table  <dig>

in vitro
assessment of the genetic stability of ribavirin-resistant prrsv mutants during serial passages in cells. the genetic stability of the plaque-purified, ribavirin-resistant mutants  was compared with that of plaque-purified vr <dig>  over  <dig> passages in marc- <dig> cells. fifteen viral clones obtained from cell culture fluids collected at the completion of  <dig> passages of each virus by plaque purification and nsp <dig>  and orf <dig>  regions of each virus clone were sequenced and compared with their parental viruses  to determine nucleotide mutations  and amino acid  substitutions during the sequential passages. asterisks represent significant differences in the mutation rate compared with vr <dig> .



discussion
in the current study, the possibility of rescuing a genetically stable prrsv mutant during sequential passages in marc- <dig> cells in the presence of mutagens was explored on the basis of previous reports that showed that mutant viruses that emerged from lethal mutagenesis driven by antiviral mutagens exhibited higher genetic stability than wild-type viruses  <cit> . to choose the most appropriate mutagen for the study, four different antiviral mutagens  were evaluated for their antiviral effects against prrsv and for their cytotoxicity in marc- <dig> cells. in the presence of ribavirin at concentrations higher than  <dig>  mm, the replication of vr <dig> was completely suppressed, whereas even at the highest concentration,  <dig>  mm, ribavirin did not cause significant cytotoxicity in marc- <dig> cells {figure  <dig> }. this result is in good agreement with previous studies conducted to evaluate the antiviral effects of ribavirin on several rna viruses, including hcv, respiratory syncytial virus , poliovirus, fmdv, and influenza a and b viruses  <cit> . recently, ribavirin was reported as a potential antiviral drug against prrsv because it reduced virus replication approximately  <dig> times in pam-pcd <dig> cells when added at a concentration of  <dig>  mm, which was the highest concentration applied in the study  <cit> . however, in the current study,  <dig>  mm ribavirin failed to suppress prrsv replication in marc- <dig> cells, and concentrations higher than  <dig>  mm ribavirin were required for complete suppression of prrsv replication . unlike the results observed in pam-pcd <dig> cells, no significant cytotoxicity was observed in marc- <dig> cells, even when treated with  <dig>  mm ribavirin. thus, ribavirin-resistant mutant viruses were rescued in the presence of ribavirin at concentrations as high as  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm. similarly, 5-fluorouracil effectively suppressed vr <dig> replication in marc- <dig> cells at concentrations ranging from  <dig>  to 1 mm without causing significant cytotoxicity {figure  <dig> }. the effective antiviral activity of 5-fluorouracil has also been reported for rift valley fever virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, poliovirus, and fmdv  <cit> . in contrast, 5-azacytidine or amiloride at concentrations between  <dig> and  <dig>  mm induced significant cytotoxicity in marc- <dig> cells, although concentrations of 5-azacytidine or amiloride lower than 1 mm showed substantial antiviral efficacy against prrsv {figure  <dig>  and figure  <dig> }. a previous study reported that 1 mm 5-azacytidine caused significant cytotoxicity in 293 t and u373-magicxcr <dig> cells 24 hours after treatment  <cit>  although a significant level of antiviral activity against hiv- <dig> was reported with 5-azacytidine at concentrations between 1 μm and 100 μm  <cit> . however, low concentrations  of 5-azacytidine did not result in significant antiviral activity against prrsv in the current study . a previous study reported that 1 mm amiloride was non-cytotoxic in hela t cells for 48 hours post-treatment  <cit> , which conflicts with the results observed in this study showing that substantial cytotoxicity was observed with 1– <dig>  mm amiloride in marc- <dig> cells at 36 hours post-treatment {figure  <dig> }. it was speculated that this dissimilarity might be due to the different origins of the cell lines used in the studies.

based on the initial assessment of antiviral mutagens, ribavirin was selected for further study to evaluate the possible emergence of ribavirin-resistant mutants because it showed the greatest effect on prrsv replication without causing significant cytotoxicity even at the highest concentration . two ribavirin-resistant mutants  were isolated at passages  <dig> and  <dig> during serial passages of vr <dig> in marc- <dig> cells in the presence of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm ribavirin, respectively . previous studies also reported the emergence of ribavirin-resistant mutants: ribavirin-resistant hcv emerged after  <dig> passages in huh7d cells cultured with  <dig>  mm ribavirin  <cit> . similarly, ribavirin-resistant cvb <dig>  poliovirus, and fmdv emerged after sequential passages in hela or bhk- <dig> cells cultured with  <dig> - <dig>  mm ribavirin  <cit> .

the growth competence of the ribavirin-resistant mutants rvrp <dig> and rvrp <dig> in marc- <dig> cells was assessed in the presence or absence of ribavirin. both of the ribavirin-resistant mutants showed approximately 10-100-times higher replication efficiency than vr <dig> in the presence of  <dig>  or  <dig>  mm ribavirin. moreover, the replication of vr <dig> was completely suppressed at concentrations higher than  <dig>  mm ribavirin, while both mutants were able to generate infectious progeny viruses, reaching titers close to  <dig> tcid50/ml in the presence of  <dig>  mm ribavirin . as reported in many previous studies conducted with poliovirus  <cit> , human enterovirus  <dig>   <cit> , fmdv  <cit> , coxsackie virus b <dig>  <cit>  and hcv  <cit> , enhanced resistance of mutant viruses to ribavirin might be associated with the increased genetic fidelity that is acquired during viral passages in the presence of ribavirin. however, the higher replication efficiency might also result from virus adaptation to marc- <dig> cells because the mutant viruses were rescued after  <dig> or  <dig> sequential passages. in fact, the mutant viruses replicated more efficiently in the absence of ribavirin compared to vr <dig>  therefore, the genetic stability of the ribavirin-resistant mutants was assessed by passaging the mutant viruses  <dig> times in marc- <dig> cells without ribavirin in parallel with vr <dig> to demonstrate that ribavirin-resistant mutants have increased genetic stability. the most variable genes  in the prrsv genome were sequenced to determine the mutation frequency of the viruses during sequential passages. rvrp <dig> and rvrp <dig> virus clones exhibited  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold lower numbers of nucleotide substitutions and  <dig> - and 4-fold lower numbers of amino acid substitutions, respectively, in the nsp <dig> region compared with vr <dig> virus clones {table  <dig> and figure  <dig> }. in the orf <dig> region, the rvrp <dig> virus clones exhibited mutation rates similar to those observed in vr <dig> virus clones, while rvrp <dig> virus clones had approximately  <dig> -fold lower numbers of nucleotide substitutions and 8-fold lower numbers of amino acid substitutions compared with vr <dig> virus clones {table  <dig> and figure  <dig> }. based on these results, it was concluded that the ribavirin-resistant mutants, especially rvrp <dig>  have significantly higher genetic stability compared with their parental virus, vr <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, ribavirin was very effective in suppressing prrsv replication in marc- <dig> cells at concentrations higher than  <dig>  mm, suggesting that ribavirin could be used as a therapeutic drug against prrsv; however, its potential usefulness against prrsv infection remains to be confirmed in animal studies. as described in the current study, the resistant viruses emerged in the presence of low concentrations  of ribavirin, and those resistant viruses had significantly higher genetic stability compared with vr <dig>  because rapid reversion of attenuated prrs vaccines to virulence is of great concern, rvrp <dig>  which has a higher level of genetic stability, could be a good candidate for the development of a safer vaccine. nonetheless, the mechanisms and genetic determinants responsible for the high genetic stability of ribavirin-resistant prrsv should be elucidated in detail in the near future.
