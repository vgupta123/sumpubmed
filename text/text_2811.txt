BACKGROUND
lignin is a complex phenolic polymer closely linked with cellulose and hemicellulose, forming an important structural component of plant secondary cell wall. it provides plants with mechanical strength and vascular integrity  <cit> , and also plays important roles in conferring tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . recently, increased concerns about climate change and the need to reduce carbon emissions have triggered a growing interest in producing renewable fuels and bioproducts from lignocellulosic biomass  <cit> . wheat is one of the most economically important crops globally, and its straw represents an abundant source of biomass that can be used as a feedstock for sustainable production of biofuel and bioproducts  <cit> .

efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels is hindered by lignin, which limits the accessibility of plant cell wall polysaccharides to chemical, enzymatic and microbial digestions  <cit> . genetic alteration of the quantity and quality of lignin in plant biomass has been considered as a viable alternative to mitigate this problem . however, lignin content in cereal crops such as wheat has been shown to be closely associated with resistance to lodging  <cit> , one of the major impediments of wheat production leading to harvestable yield loss by up to 80 %  <cit> . therefore, it is imperative to design tools and approaches that can alter the quantity and quality of lignin in wheat biomass without affecting its functions in conferring structural support for normal growth and development, and field performance. this, however, requires detailed dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of lignin in wheat biomass.

it has been established that lignin in plants is formed by the oxidative coupling of three monolignols that serve as building blocks; coniferyl, sinapyl and p-coumaryl alcohols  <cit> . these monolignols are synthesized from phenylalanine through the general phenylpropanoid and monolignol-specific pathways , and the successive dehydrogenative polymerization reactions give rise to guaiacyl , syringyl  and hydroxyphenyl  units, respectively, that form a complex and three-dimensional lignin polymer  <cit> . in addition, lignin formation involves the incorporation of other monomers such as hydroxycinnamyl acetates, hydroxycinnamyl p-hydroxybenzoates, and hydroxycinnamyl p-coumarates under specific genetic and environmental conditions  <cit> .fig.  <dig> lignin biosynthesis pathway in plants. the monolignols  synthesized from phenylalanine through the general phenylpropanoid pathway  and monolignol-specific pathway  are oxidized and incorporated into the g , s  and h  units, respectively, in the complex and three-dimensional polymer of lignin . oligolignols, which are formed during lignin polymerization, are racemic radical coupling products of monolignols. pal, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; c4h, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4cl, 4-coumarate:coa ligase; c3h, p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; hct, p-hydroxycinnamoyl-coa:quinate/shikimate p-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase; ccoaomt, caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase; ccr, cinnamoyl-coa reductase; f5h, ferulate 5-hydroxylase; comt, caffeic acid o-methyltransferase; cad, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase



lignin biosynthesis has been studied extensively in the model plant arabidopsis and other dicot species such as alfalfa and tobacco, and these studies have led to the identification of genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing many of the steps in the pathway   <cit> . since they catalyze the first committed step in the general phenylpropanoid pathway and the last step in the synthesis of monolignols, the pal and cad enzymes, respectively, are belived to play critical roles in regulating lignin accumulation in plants . given that most of the lignin biosynthetic enzymes have isoforms, they appear to be encoded by gene families  <cit> , and previous studies have demonstrated the physiological roles for most of these genes in determining lignin deposition and composition  <cit> . for example, suppression of genes early in the pathway such as pal, c4h, hct, c3h and ccoaomt in alfalfa and tobacco leads to reduction in total lignin content, while repression of f5h or comt, which are involved in the synthesis of the s unit of lignin, results in alteration of the s/g ratio of lignin with only minimal effect on total lignin content  <cit> . genetic repression of cad, encoding an enzyme that catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of monolignols, also causes reduction in the s/g ratio with limited effect on total lignin content. similarly, the f5h <dig> and comt mutants of arabidopsis are characterized by decreased amounts of s unit containing oligolignols with no effect on the total lignin content, whereas the c4h, 4cl <dig>  ccoaomt <dig>  and ccr <dig> mutants contain lower amount of total lignin as compared to the wild-type  <cit> .

although lignin biosynthesis pathway has not been elucidated in wheat to date, previous studies have characterized the expression patterns of the wheat homologs of lignin biosynthetic genes. the transcripts for most of these homologs appeared to be highly abundant in the stem tissue as compared to the leaf sheath and leaf blade, and the expressions of pal <dig>  c4h, 4cl <dig>  c3h <dig>  ccr <dig>  f5h <dig> and f5h <dig> in particular are found to have a significant correlation with lignin content  <cit> . furthermore, the stem exhibits higher abundance of ccr <dig> and cad <dig> transcripts and higher activity of the corresponding enzymes than that detected in other tissues, while comt <dig> is expressed constitutively across the different tissues including stem, leaf and root  <cit> . comparative analysis between wheat cultivars with varying degree of resistance to lodging showed the presence of higher transcript abundance of ccr <dig>  comt <dig> and cad <dig> genes and higher activities of the corresponding enzymes in the stem of lodging resistant cultivar following the heading stage, and these factors have been shown to be closely associated with stem lignin content and mechanical strength  <cit> . despite these results, the molecular mechanism underlying the synthesis of lignin in wheat tissues is yet poorly understood.

waterlogging is one of the abiotic factors adversely affecting crop productivity; it causes a reduction in gas diffusion and thereby affects the availability of oxygen in the rhizosphere, inducing changes in biochemical and metabolic processes  <cit> . one of the main metabolic changes involves a shift from aerobic to anaerobic respiration, impairing atp production. compensation of the resulting energy deficit requires accelerated glycolysis via increased activities of glycolytic and fermentative enzymes, leading to the depletion of carbohydrate reserves, a phenomenon referred to as the “pasteur effect”  <cit> . consistently, transcriptional activation of glycolytic and fermentative genes has been reported in rice coleoptiles under anoxic conditions  <cit> . in contrast with this, root hypoxic conditions have been shown to result in accumulation of soluble carbohydrates such as sucrose, and those with storage function such as fructan in both root and shoot tissues of wheat seedlings  <cit> . under long-term hypoxic conditions, a large amount of sucrose in wheat roots partitions to the synthesis of cell wall components, mainly cellulose, leading to changes in cell wall structure  <cit> . it is therefore likely that such alteration in the structure of the cell wall serves as one of the strategies used by the root tissue to compensate the progressive dissolution of cortical cells for aerenchyma formation, thereby contributing to the maintenance of cell wall function under low o <dig> stress conditions  <cit> . however, little is known to date about the molecular features mediating the response of lignin biosynthesis to waterlogging conditions.

in addition to environmental factors, cellular signaling molecules such as plant hormones regulate lignin biosynthesis  <cit> . for example, auxin and cytokinin induce the expression of the lignin biosynthetic gene, peroxidase , in zinnia elegans, and secondary growth/lignification  <cit> . consistently, the promoter of prx consists of motifs that mediate the response of prx to these hormones and thereby act as targets for transcription factors regulating secondary growth  <cit> . furthermore, hypergravity-induced auxin accumulation leads to enhanced expression of selected lignin biosynthetic genes, and in turn lignification in the inflorescence stem of arabidopsis  <cit> . it has been shown previously that the level of salicylic acid  is inversely related to lignin content in plants where lignin content is reduced through downregulation of specific lignin biosynthetic genes, and sa mediates growth supression in these plants; however, genetic reduction of sa level was found to restore growth but not lignin content  <cit> .

to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of lignin formation in wheat, we performed comparative analysis of lignin biosynthesis in the internode tissue of wheat cultivars with varying degree of resistance to lodging, a trait closely associated with stem lignin content and mechanical strength. furthermore, the study identified candidate genes that mediate the response of lignin biosynthesis in wheat tissues to waterlogging, and examined the association between the levels of lignin and selected plant hormones that have been implicated to have roles in the regulation of lignin biosynthesis.

methods
plant material
two hexaploid wheat cultivars, harvest and kane, were used in this study, and seeds for these cultivars were kindly provided by dr. stephen fox of agriculture and agri-food canada -cereal research center . both are hard red spring wheat cultivars developed by aafc  <cit> , and were selected for the present study on the basis of their agronomic quality in terms of lodging resistance, which is considered as a measure of stem mechanical strength, and their close genetic relationship. mature dry seeds of the two cultivars were imbibed in petri dishes for  <dig> days, after which the germinated seeds were transplanted to 1-gallon plastic pots  containing super mix supplied with 18 g of fertilizers . plants were grown in a growth chamber at 22/20 °c  under a 16/8 h photoperiod until harvest. at the heading stage, two sets of samples were collected: the first set was harvested from cv. harvest and consisted of flag leaf blade, flag leaf sheath, peduncle, first internode , a combination of second and third internodes  and the fourth internode . numerical designation of the internodes was based on their relative position to the peduncle in which in- <dig> is the youngest internode located next to the peduncle, while in- <dig> is the oldest internode located next to the base of the stem. the second set of samples was harvested from the two cultivars, cvs. harvest and kane, and consisted of the whole flag leaf  and the internode . tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after harvest and then stored at −80 °c until further use.

waterlogging treatment
for waterlogging treatment, plants of cv. harvest were grown as described above except that the soil mixture consisted of clay and sand . four weeks after transplanting, a set of  <dig> plants was subjected to waterlogging by submerging each pot containing a plant in a 5 l containers filled with water in order to maintain the water level at 2 cm above the surface of the soil. the water in the bigger container was replenished as required. concurrently, another set of  <dig> plants was subjected to regular watering . at heading stage, which occurred at  <dig> to 22 days after the start of waterlogging in both treated and untreated control plants, the flag leaf and in-2& <dig> tissues were harvested in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °c until further use.

identification of candidate lignin biosynthetic genes and phylogenetic analysis
the tentative consensus  sequences of candidate lignin biosynthetic genes from the dana-farber cancer institute  wheat gene index  release  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  were used to search for the corresponding tcs in tagi release  <dig>   <cit> . the genbank ids corresponding to the newly identified tcs were used to search the national center for biotechnology information  wheat unigene dataset containing  <dig>  unigenes   <cit>  to obtain the respective unigenes, which consist of a cluster of sequences representing a unique lignin biosynthetic gene family member. a complete coding sequence  from each sequence cluster or a tc sequence from release  <dig>  was used as a query to blast search the ncbi genbank nucleotide database   <cit>  for additional family members from wheat  or for homologous genes from other species using the criteria of at least 50 % coverage of the query sequence and e-value of ≤10− <dig>  sequences meeting these criteria were collected for each lignin biosynthetic gene family and used to generate phylogenetic trees. the sequences were collected mainly from rice , sorghum , barley , switchgrass , maize , and other species for which candidate lignin biosynthetic gene sequence information is available. sequences of the arabidopsis lignin biosynthetic genes were collected based on the protein sequences reported in xu et al.  <cit> . the nucleotide sequences of the genes were then aligned using clustalw program   <cit>  and the phylogenetic tree was generated with the molecular evolutionary genetic analysis  software   <cit>  using a tamura-nei model and a  <dig> replicate bootstrap method of phylogeny test.

rna extraction and cdna synthesis
total rna was isolated from tissues using trizol reagent following the manufacturer’s protocol . the rna samples were digested with dnase  to eliminate genomic dna contamination. the first strand cdna was synthesized from 1 μg of total rna using iscript reverse transcription supermix  in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. the resulting cdna samples were diluted 20× before use as a template for real-time quantitative pcr .

real-time quantitative pcr assay
the real time qpcr assays for the candidate lignin biosynthetic and the reference β-actin genes were performed with the gene specific primers described previously  <cit>  except for the new candidate genes identified in this study and the genes for which redesigning the primers was required due to their lack of target gene specificity . gene specificity of all the primers was verified first by blast searching the target amplicons against genbank database and then by rt-pcr. the qpcr assay was performed on the cfx <dig> real-time pcr system  and the reaction consists of 5 μl of the diluted cdna as a template, 10 μl of ssofast evagreen supermix ,  <dig>  μl of 5 μm forward primer ,  <dig>  μl of 5 μm reverse primer  and  <dig>  μl diethylpyrocarbonate treated water. the samples were subjected to the following thermal cycling conditions: dna polymerase activation at 95 °c for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °c for 15 s, annealing at 50–66 °c  for 30 s and extension at 72 °c for 30 s in duplicate in 96-well optical reaction plates . transcript levels of the target genes were expressed after normalization with β-actin using the livak and schmittgen method  <cit> .

measurement of enzyme activity
protein concentrations and enzyme activities were determined spectrophotometrically . total protein extraction, and the assays for determining the activities of coniferyl aldehyde recognizing cad  and sinapyl aldehyde recognizing cad  were carried out as described in zhang et al.  <cit> . briefly, frozen plant tissue  was ground into fine powder using mortar and pestle, mixed with protein extraction buffer and then incubated at 4 °c for  <dig>  h. protein concentration in the extract was measured using quick start™ bradford protein assay . the cad-ca and cad-sa activities were examined by using total protein extract  in 500 μl reaction buffer and monitoring the conversion of coniferyl alcohol, a substrate for cad-ca, and sinapyl alcohol, a substrate for cad-sa, to their respective products at 400 nm. the activity of pal in the protein extract was assayed as described in edwards and kessmann  <cit>  in which the formation of cinnamic acid from l-phenylalanine was monitored at 290 nm for up to 2 h using total protein extract  in 1 ml reaction buffer. the activity for each enzyme was expressed as nkatal  per gram of total protein.

measurement of lignocellulosic constituents
frozen leaf and internode tissue samples were lyophilized, and then subjected to analysis of the lignocellulosic constituents, which was performed at the feeds innovation institute of the university of saskatchewan . lignin and acid detergent fiber  contents were profiled using the association of official analytical chemists  method  <dig>   <cit>  while the neutral detergent fiber  content was determined using the aoac method  <dig>   <cit> . cellulose content was expressed as the difference between adf and lignin contents; while the hemicellulose content was expressed as the difference between ndf and adf contents.

measurement of hormone levels
hormone levels were measured from the same tissue samples used for analysis of gene expression and the levels of lignocellulosic constituents. auxin , cytokinin  and salicylic acid  were extracted from the internode tissues as described previously  <cit>  except that the intial extraction was performed with 80 %  acetonitrile containing 1 %  acetic acid and elutions of the iaa and sa extracts from the respective columns were performed with 80 %  acetonitrile containing 1 %  acetic acid while the ipa and t-zeatin extracts were eluted with 60 %  acetonitrile containing 5 %  aqueous ammonia. quantification of the iaa, ipa and t-zeatin, and sa levels was performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometery system   according to the protocol described in yoshimoto et al.  <cit> .

statistical analysis
significant difference between sample means was tested using either lsd test or t-student test at p <  <dig> . statistical analysis was performed with genstat version  <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
update on the wheat homologs of lignin biosynthetic genes
using the tagi release  <dig> and  <dig>  bi et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> candidate lignin biosynthetic genes belonging to  <dig> gene families; however only two of them, comt <dig> and comt <dig>  were found to have sequences that represent complete cds in the respective cluster of sequences. since the genbank database has been updated with more wheat gene sequences and the tagi release  <dig> consisting of  <dig>  tcs has been made available since the report of bi et al.  <cit> , we performed further database mining and updated the list of the candidate wheat lignin biosynthetic gene . our search revealed that specific ests assigned by bi et al.  <cit>  to different gene family members appear to originate from the same unigene, thus represent the same gene family member instead of different members. ests designated in bi et al.  <cit>  as 4cl <dig> and 4cl <dig> are found to belong to the same unigene , thus represent the same 4cl gene designated hereafter as 4cl1; ests designated as ccoaomt <dig> and ccoaomt <dig> come from the same unigene , thus represent the same ccoaomt gene designated hereafter as ccoaomt1; ests designated as ccoaomt <dig> and ccoaomt <dig> originate from the same unigene , thus represent the same ccoaomt gene designated hereafter as ccoaomt <dig>  and ests designated as pal <dig>  pal <dig> and pal <dig> derive from the same unigene , thus represent the same pal gene designated hereafter as pal <dig>  accordingly, the ests identified by bi et al.  <cit>  as pal <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are redesignated as pal <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the selection of a particular est for the designation in each family member was based on their coding region coverage, and these specific ests were considered for our gene expression analysis . furthermore, the est assigned by the same authors as cad <dig> is found to be a homolog of the ccr gene, thus it is re-designated hereafter as ccr <dig> . our search also led to the identification of new candidate lignin biosynthetic genes belonging to the c3h , ccr  and comt  gene families .table  <dig> updated list of the candidate lignin biosynthesis gene family members of wheat

phylogenetic analysis of the candidate lignin biosynthesis genes
phylogenetic analysis of the wheat candidate lignin biosynthetic genes along with the representative homologs from other species  revealed that each wheat candidate gene is clustered with more than one homolog derived from the other species except that all the three wheat comt genes formed their own group . in contrast, the six ccr genes were distributed among five different clades . overall, most of the wheat lignin biosynthetic genes are grouped mainly with their homologs that originate from monocot species instead of those derived from arabidopsis and other dicot species .

lodging behavior of the wheat cultivars
harvest and kane are among the cultivars widely grown in the wheat growing regions of the canadian prairies  <cit> . these two cultivars are closely related genetically as they are developed by a cross that involved a common parental line; kane is derived from a cross between ac domain and mckenzie  <cit> , and harvest from a cross between ac domain* <dig> and nd <dig>  <cit>  . with respect to their resistance to lodging, kane and harvest are rated as ‘very good’ and ‘good’, respectively  <cit> . it can also be inferred from the registration data of harvest and kane, which compared each cultivar against the same check cultivar over three years at multiple locations, that harvest exhibits lower lodging score than kane; lodging rated on a 1– <dig> scale, 1 = vertical and 9 = flat  <cit> . kane exhibited consistently similar lodging scores to the check cultivars ac barrie   <cit> . in contrast, harvest exhibited lower lodging score than the check cultivar ac barrie   <cit> . as the studies that compared each cultivar against the common check cutivar were conducted at different times, the results also suggest that the severity of lodging was worse in years when the performance of harvest was tested.

expression of the candidate lignin biosynthetic genes in different wheat tissues
the expression patterns of candidate lignin biosynthetic genes in different tissues and stages of wheat have been characterized previously  <cit> . given that the list of the candidate genes has been updated with the latest databases  and our experimental materials involve wheat cultivars different from that used by bi et al.  <cit> , we decided to re-examine the spatiotemporal expression pattern of all the candidate genes. our analysis revealed that all the candidate genes showed higher expression in the peduncle and/or internode tissues than in the flag leaf blade/sheath except that ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> genes exhibited significantly higher expression in the flag leaf blade than in the other tissues analyzed in this study, and comt <dig> and cad <dig> in their respective gene family are found to be highly expressed in both flag leaf sheath and internode tissues . the c3h <dig>  ccoaomt <dig> and ccr <dig> genes are found to be expressed at very low/undetectable level across all the tissue analyzed.

specific members in each gene family including pal <dig>  c4h <dig>  4cl <dig>  hct <dig>  c3h <dig>  ccoaomt <dig>  ccr <dig>  f5h <dig> and comt <dig> appeared to be highly expressed in the peduncle/internode . from the cad gene family, the transcripts of both cad <dig> and cad <dig> are highly abundant in the internode, although the transcript level of cad <dig> is slightly higher than that of cad <dig>  comparative analysis across the different internode sections revealed that most of these genes are highly expressed in the in-2& <dig> and/or in- <dig> sections . as a result, their expression in in-2& <dig> was further compared between the two cultivars with varying degree of resistance to lodging, a trait closely associated with stem lignin content. it appeared from our analysis that 4cl <dig>  hct <dig>  c3h <dig>  f5h <dig> and comt <dig> genes exhibit significantly higher transcript level in the internode of cv. harvest than in cv. kane . although not statistically significant, higher expression of ccr <dig> was also evident in the internode of cv. harvest. the other four genes, pal <dig>  c4h <dig>  ccoaomt <dig> and cad <dig>  exhibited similar expression level between the two cultivars.table  <dig> relative transcript levels of lignin biosynthesis genes highly expressed in different tissues of wheatw

transcriptional response of candidate lignin biosynthetic genes to waterlogging
in order to gain insights into the transcriptional regulation of lignin biosynthesis genes by waterlogging, we analyzed the expression of all the candidate genes in the internodes of waterlogged plants. waterlogging led to a significant transcriptional repression of pal <dig>  4cl <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  f5h <dig>  f5h <dig> and comt <dig> genes . on the other hand, all the pal genes, except pal <dig> and pal <dig>  were upregulated in response to waterlogging; the expression of pal <dig> in particular was induced by ~200-fold. however, the basal expression level of this gene in the internodes of untreated control plants was relatively low . other genes with ≥2-fold upregulation in response to waterlogging include c4h <dig>  ccoaomt <dig>  ccoaomt <dig>  ccoaomt <dig>  ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  the waterlogging treatment also induced upregulation  of cad <dig> and cad <dig> genes, although not ≥2-fold. however, the expressions of pal <dig>  4cl <dig>  c3h <dig>  c3h <dig>  comt <dig>  ccr <dig> and cad <dig> remained unaffected by the waterlogging treatment.fig.  <dig> expression of lignin biosynthesis genes in the internode and flag leaf in response to waterlogging. relative transcript levels of each gene in the internode  and flag leaf  tissues of waterlogged plants of cv. harvest were expressed relative to that detected in the corresponding tissue of the control plants, which was arbitrarily set to a value of  <dig>  data are means of  <dig> to  <dig> independent biological replicates ± se. the * and ○ symbols indicate statistically significant upregulation and downregulation of the taget genes in response to waterlogging, respectively, as compared to that of the control at p <  <dig> . c3h <dig> was not analyzed as no transcript of this gene was detected in the internode  and flag leaf tissues of wheat 



to better understand the effects of waterlogging on lignin synthesis, we also analyzed the expression of lignin biosynthesis genes in the flag leaf  of waterlogged plants. waterlogging led to ≥2-fold upregulation of pal <dig>  c4h <dig>  4cl <dig>  ccoaomt <dig>  ccoaomt <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  f5h <dig>  comt <dig>  comt <dig>  cad <dig> and cad <dig> genes , of which pal <dig>  c4h <dig>  4cl <dig>  ccoaomt <dig>  f5h <dig> and comt <dig> are found to be the predominant genes in the leaf tissue in their respective family . although ccoaomt <dig> and ccr <dig> showed drastic induction  in response to waterlogging, their basal expression in the flag leaf of the control untreated plants was very low .

waterlogging induced ≥2-fold upregulation of pal <dig>  pal <dig>  pal <dig>  pal <dig> and ccr <dig> was evident in the internode but not in the flag leaf, where their expression appeared not to be affected by waterlogging . in contrast, waterlogging led to ≥2-fold upregulation of pal <dig>  4cl <dig>  ccr <dig>  f5h <dig>  comt <dig> and comt <dig> in the flag leaf but not in the internode, where their expression was either repressed or remained unaffected.

analysis of the activity of lignin biosynthesis enzymes
to gain insights into the association between transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations of genes encoding key lignin biosynthetic enzymes, we measured the activities of pal catalyzing the first committed step in the phenylpropanoid pathway and cad catalyzing the last step in the monolignol pathway . our data showed slightly higher activity of internode-derived pal in cv. kane than in cv. harvest . the activity of cad-sa and cad-ca in the internode was found to be similar between the two cultivars. waterlogging led to significant reduction in the activities of internode-derived pal and cad-sa enzymes although no effect was evident on the activity of cad-ca . however, it caused significant increases in the activities of flag leaf-derived pal, cad-ca, and cad-sa enzymes .fig.  <dig> expression of pal and cad genes and activity of the corresponding enzymes. relative transcript levels of internode-derived pal  and cad  genes and activities of pal, cad-ca and cad-sa enzymes  were compared between the wheat cultivars kane and harvest; the internodes were collected at the heading stage. transcript levels were expressed relative to that of pal <dig>  and cad <dig>  in cv. kane, which were arbitrarily set to a value of  <dig>  data are means of  <dig> to  <dig> independent biological replicates ± se. different letters within each gene and enzyme show statistically significant difference in activity at p <  <dig>

analysis of the major lignocellulosic constituents
to determine the association of stem resistance to lodging with the level of lignin and other cell wall components including cellulose and hemicellulose, we profiled their levels in the internode tissue of cvs. harvest and kane. internode lignin content of cv. harvest was over 23 % higher than that observed in cv. kane . similarly, the internode cellulose content of cv. harvest was over 9 % higher than that of cv. kane. with respect to hemicellulose, the internode of cv. kane exhibited ~6 % higher level than that of cv. harvest. waterlogging caused significant reduction in the amounts of both lignin  and cellulose  contents in the internode tissues; however, no effect was evident on the content of hemicellulose . it also led to 60 % decrease in the flag leaf lignin content, while causing  <dig> and 30 % increases in the contents of cellulose and hemicellulose, respectively .fig.  <dig> profiles of the major constituents of lignocellulose. cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin levels were determined in the internodes of the two wheat cultivars kane and harvest , and in the internode  and leaf  tissues of cv. harvest in response to waterlogging . data are means of  <dig> to  <dig> independent biological replicates ± se. different letters within each lignocellulosic constituent show statistically significant difference in level at p <  <dig> . plant materials to study differences in the amounts of the major constituents of lignocellulose between the two cultivars were grown in super mix  while plant materials to study the effect of waterlogging on the level of the major constituents of lignocellulose were grown in soil mixture of clay and sand

to examine the association between the levels of lignin and plant hormones that are implicated in the regulation of lignin biosynthesis, we measured the amounts of iaa, ipa and t-zeatin, and sa in the internode tissues. the levels of ipa, t-zeatin and sa in the internode of cv. harvest were found to be higher than that observed in the internode of cv. kane while the iaa content did not show any difference . waterlogging, which decreased lignin content , led to a significant reduction in ipa and t-zeatin levels. in contrast, the level of iaa increased in response to waterlogging while no change in sa content was evident .fig.  <dig> profiles of salicylic acid , cytokinin , and auxin . hormonal levels were determined in the internodes of the two wheat cultivars kane and harvest , and in the internode of cv. harvest in response to waterlogging  . data are means of  <dig> to  <dig> independent biological replicates ± se. different letters within each hormone show statistically significant difference in level at p <  <dig> . plant materials to study differences in the levels of sa, t-zeatin, ipa and iaa between the two cultivars were grown in super mix  while plant materials to study the effect of waterlogging on the levels of sa, t-zeatin, ipa and iaa were grown in soil mixture of clay and sand 



discussion
in order to gain insights into the molecular basis for the regulation lignin biosynthesis in wheat tissues, this study first examined the expression of lignin biosynthetic genes in different wheat tissues and then compared the expression patterns of selected genes in the internode tissue between two different wheat cultivars exhibiting different degree of resistance to lodging. the study also investigated the effect of waterlogging on the expression of lignin biosynthetic genes and the level of major lignocellulosic constituents. furthermore, we assessed if lignin content is associated with the level of plant hormones implicatied in regulating lignin biosynthesis in other species.

our gene expression data indicated high transcript abundance of pal <dig>  c4h <dig>  4cl <dig>  hct <dig>  c3h <dig>  ccoaomt <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  f5h <dig>  comt <dig> and cad <dig> genes in wheat tissues , thus, it is more likely that these genes play important roles in the regulation of lignin biosynthesis in wheat. these results are in agreement with the expression patterns of lignin biosynthetic genes reported previously in both wheat and arabidopsis  <cit> . within the stem, older internodes appeared to have higher expression for most of the candidate genes than the younger internode sections. consistently, the expressions of selected lignin biosynthetic genes and lignin level have been shown to increase with internode age  <cit> . although a specific member in each gene family exhibits predominance in expression across the different wheat tissues, two members of the ccr gene family showed tissue specificity; ccr <dig> is predominantly expressed in the flag leaf while ccr <dig> in the internode . it has also been shown previously that the gene we designated as ccr <dig> exhibits higher expression in the internode  <cit> .

we further compared the expression of the candidate genes in two wheat cultivars exhibiting varying degrees of resistance to lodging, namely harvest and kane; cv. harvest is designated agronomically as more resistant to lodging than cv. kane. the higher internode lignin content of cv. harvest than that of cv. kane  suggests a close association between stem mechanical strength/lodging resistance and stem lignin content  <cit> . the association of internode lignin content of cv. harvest with the expression of 4cl <dig>  ccr <dig>  f5h <dig> and comt <dig> genes reflects the significance of these specific genes in regulating internode lignin content, which contributes to stem mechanical strength/lodging resistance in wheat. a close association between wheat stem lignin content and the expression of ccr and comt genes and activities of the corresponding enzymes has also been reported previously  <cit> . however, the difference in lodging resistance between the two cultivars may also be at least partly due to other factors that contribute to stem stiffness and thickness than internode lignin content, such as densities of cellulose and hemicellulose, structural properties of the secondary cell wall, and structural traits associated with cortical fiber tissues . consistently, the enhanced culm mechanical strength in a lignin deficient rice variety a has been shown to be associated with high densities of cellulose and hemicellulose, well developed secondary cell walls and thick layer of cortical fiber tissues  <cit> .

lignin biosynthesis in plants is affected by both biotic and abiotic stress factors  <cit> . waterlogging is among the abiotic stress factor that triggers reduction of leaf photosynthetic capacity  <cit>  and accumulation of soluble carbohydrate in plant biomass  <cit> . furthermore, it triggers increased demand for soluble sugars, particularly glucose  <cit> , which might lead to the channeling of more phosphoenol pyruvate to glycolysis rather than to the shikimate pathway that produces phenylalanine, an important lignin precursor  <cit> . these changes have important implications on the level and/or composition of structural carbohydrate polymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin  <cit> . consistently, the level of lignin in both internode and flag leaf tissues was substantially reduced in response to waterlogging . in the internode, waterlogging also caused a significant reduction in cellulose content; leading to a decrease in the total amount of structural carbohydrates. since the synthesis of structural carbohydrate components such as lignin is an energy-consuming and irreversible process  <cit> , reduction in their level might be one of the energy/carbon saving strategies employed by plants under waterlogging conditions  <cit> . in the flag leaf, the decrease in lignin content appears, however, to be compensated by significant increases in the levels of cellulose and hemicellulose .

among the genes identified as highly expressed in wheat biomass, transcriptional repression of pal <dig>  ccr <dig> and f5h <dig> was apparent specifically in the internode of waterlogged wheat plants , suggesting the importance of these genes in modulating lignin formation in the internode under such stress conditions. consistent with the lignin profile and expression of the pal <dig> gene, waterlogging caused reduction in the activity of internode derived pal , an enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in the general phenylpropanoid pathway, and thereby controling lignin synthesis  <cit> . in contrast, waterlogging mediated reduction of lignin content in both internode and leaf tissues is accompanied by upregulation of pal <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the internode and pal <dig> in the leaf; upregulation of pal <dig> in the leaf is associated with increased activity of the pal enzyme. given that individual pal genes respond differentially to abiotic stressors  <cit>  and some pal genes have been implicated in the synthesis of other phenylpropanoid-derived molecules such as tannins and anthocyanin  <cit> , which are known to function in diverse stress responses  <cit> , it is likely that the pal genes upregulated in the tissues of waterlogged plants play a role for enhanced production of molecules that provide protection against waterlogging stress. since the pal <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes of waterlogged internodes are upregulated while the pal activity is substantially reduced, we cannot rule out the possibility that these genes are subjected to post-transcriptional regulation. in support of this, kelch repeat f-box  proteins mediated ubiquitination and degradation of the pal isozymes have been shown to occur in arabidopsis  <cit> . furthermore, mapping of phosphopeptides in the pal of zea mays and medicago truncatula has led to the speculation that pal activity can be regulated post-transcriptionally by phosphorylation  <cit> .

waterlogging, which markedly reduced lignin content, also induced ≥2-fold upregulation of several genes downstream of pal including c4h <dig>  hct <dig> and ccoaomt <dig> in the internode and c4h <dig>  4cl <dig>  hct <dig>  ccoaomt <dig>  f5h <dig>  comt <dig>  cad <dig> and cad <dig> genes in the leaf ; and the induction of cad <dig> and cad <dig> in the leaf is associated with increased activity cad . it has been shown in previous studies that phenylpropanoid/monolignol pathway intermediates can serve as precursors not only for lignin but also for a range of secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, coumarins, stilbenes, hydroxycinnamic acid conjugates and lignans that play important roles in stress-related processes  <cit> . under stress conditions, when photosynthesis is sub-optimal, plants may re-direct the phenylpropanoid/monolignol pathway intermediates towards the production of these secondary metabolites  <cit> . therefore, waterlogging-induced upregulation of the several lignin biosynthesis genes downstream of pal in both internode and leaf tissues while lignin level is reduced might suggest the role of these genes for increased synthesis of anti-stress secondary metabolites at the expense of lignin to help the plants overcome the adverse effects of waterlogging. in support of this hypothesis, some isoforms of the enzymes or family members of the genes downstream of pal have been implicated in the synthesis of phenylpropanoid-derived secondary metabolites  <cit> . however, the possibility for post-transcriptional regulation of these downstream monolignol pathway genes can not be excluded as a recent study in poplar has shown that the activity of 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde o-methyltransferase /comt can be regulated by phosphorylation  <cit> , and the cad and ccr of some species contain phosphopeptides that act as sites for phosphorylation mediated post-transcriptional regulation  <cit> .

previous studies have provided important insights into the role of different plant hormones in regulating the synthesis of lignin in plant tissues. for example, the levels of sa and lignin have been shown to have inverse relationship in plants where lignin content is reduced through down regulation of lignin biosynthetic genes, and sa was reported to mediate growth reduction in these plants  <cit> . however, genetic reduction of sa level restores growth but not the lignin content. the presence of similar amounts of sa between the internodes of cvs. harvest and kane  or between those derived from waterlogged and control plants  irrespective of differences in their lignin content might implicate that sa does not directly affect lignin formation. close association between iaa and lignin levels has been reported previously in which iaa induces the expression of lignin biosynthetic genes and activity of the corresponding enzymes, and thereby lignification  <cit> . however, internodes of the two cultivars with varying lignin content exhibit similar iaa level . furthermore, internodes of waterlogged wheat plants, which exhibit reduced lignin content , contain higher amount of iaa than the internodes of control plants . these results might imply the significance of iaa signaling rather than iaa level in the control of lignin formation in wheat stem. consistent with their role in enhancing lignin synthesis  <cit> , the levels of two bioactive cytokinins, ipa and t-zeatin, are directly associated with internode lignin content, suggesting that the level of liginin in wheat biomass can be optimized through manipulation of the level of cytokinin, ipa and t-zeatin. since these plant hormones can also influence other plant developmental processes that potentially affect cell wall propreties and composition  <cit> , further studies are needed to examine their specific physiological roles in determining lignin formation in wheat tissues. a recent report has also implicated other hormones such as absicic acid, brassinosteroids, jasmonates and ethylene in regulating cell wall properties and compoistion  <cit> . given that plant hormones interact either synergistically or antagonstically in regulating a wide range of plant developmental processes  <cit> , it is important to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying the role of hormonal interactions in the control of lignin synthesis in wheat tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that among the candidate lignin biosynthetic genes that are highly expressed in wheat tissues, the expressions of 4cl <dig>  c3h <dig>  ccr <dig>  f5h <dig> and comt <dig> appear to be associated with internode lignin content, which contributes at least partly to lodging resistance. reduction of the lignin content in the internode of waterlogged wheat plants appeared to be mediated by transcriptional repression of pal <dig>  ccr <dig> and f5h <dig> genes, implying the significance of these genes in modulating lignin level under such stress conditions. furthermore, changes in internode lignin content are shown to be accompanied by changes in the level of cytokinin, ipa and t-zeatin, suggesting the role of cytokinin in the regulation of lignin deposition in wheat biomass. given that mechanical strength/resistance to lodging, tolerance to biotic and abiotic stressors and feedstock quality of wheat straw are closely associated with lignin content, the findings of this study provides important insights into our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying lignin formation in wheat biomass. this is an important initial step towards the development of molecular tools that can facilitate the breeding of wheat cultivars with optimized lignin content, enhancing the feedstock quality of wheat straw without affecting lignin-associated agronomic traits.
