BACKGROUND
the innate immune system is the first line of defence against invading pathogens and is activated by conserved pathogen associated molecular patterns . toll-like receptors , a family of signalling molecules that bind to pamps and consequently trigger an immune response  <cit> , play a major role within the innate immune system. tlrs are found in all animals and even plant homologues have been described  <cit> , illustrating the ancient origin of this gene family. most mammalian species share ten tlr genes , each detecting pamps with different molecular structures.

tlrs bind their ligands in a horseshoe-shaped leucine rich repeat  domain, which enables a toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor  domain to associate with adapter proteins like the toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor domain-containing adapter protein , lymphocyte antigen  <dig> , or myeloid differentiation primary response protein  which binds with the interleukin- <dig> receptor-associated kinase  <dig> . this binding activates the tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor  <dig> , triggering a cascade which finally results in nuclear factor-kappa b  liberation, activating the expression of pro-inflammatory genes . an additional molecule, the toll-interacting protein , is involved in the regulation of this process  <cit> . myd <dig>  tirap, irak- <dig> and traf <dig> are also involved in tlr-induced apoptosis mediated by caspase- <dig>  . the toll-like receptor adaptor molecules  have been shown to activate traf <dig> and also to trigger interferon α or β  responses  <cit> . the transcriptional regulation of type i interferons is coordinated, at least in part, by interferon regulatory factors  <dig> and  <dig> . irf <dig> and irf <dig> can also be activated by kinases which are regulated by myd88/traf <dig>  <cit> . the pre-eminence of tlrs and these associated signalling molecules in the initial recognition of pathogens suggests that they could be strong candidates for animal health traits.

in humans, polymorphisms within genes coding for tlr and associated signalling molecules are associated with a predisposition to several diseases  <cit> . there is increasing evidence pointing to the strong possibility that polymorphisms in livestock tlr genes might affect immune related traits  <cit>  and might explain at least part of the observed variation in disease resistance. a number of immune-related quantitative trait loci  studies have been conducted in the major livestock species and the data are made publicly available  <cit> . however, the causal genes underlying these qtls have not been identified. consequently, the tlr genes and their related signalling molecules which are located within these qtls should be considered as potential candidates for explaining phenotypic variation in disease related traits and could therefore be exploited through genetic selection for desirable alleles.

another approach to identify genes underlying variation in immune responses is the analysis of gene expression patterns in populations with divergent resistance status pre or post infection. in mice, several differential gene expression studies involving a multitude of traits have been conducted, resulting in large datasets which are publicly available  <cit> . however, this type of information is more limited for livestock species. differential expression of tlrs and related genes has been analysed in the gastrointestinal tract of sheep infected with haemonchus contortus and trichostronglyus colubriformis  <cit> . in cattle, expression differences have been investigated in breeds of different susceptibility to theileria annulata  <cit>  and trypanosoma congolense . studies in pig have mostly addressed the role of specific tlrs during host pathogen interaction and have been reviewed recently  <cit> . however, to date, no studies in pigs have been undertaken to investigate tlr gene expression differences in phenotypically divergent lines.

although genes involved in tlr signalling have been annotated in the mouse and human genomes and successfully mapped in cattle  <cit> , only a subset of tlrs and no tlr-associated signalling molecules have been localised in other livestock species. only tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> have been mapped in the porcine genome  <cit> , while the locations of the sheep tlr and associated genes are currently unknown.

here we report the genomic locations of ten tlr genes  and a further ten associated signalling molecules in sheep, pig, cattle, human and mouse and compare their positions with previously published health related qtls. we identify tlr-related genes which are located in homologous regions that are associated with similar health related traits in several species and investigate their importance by functional comparison with other linked immune related genes.

RESULTS
localisation of tlr and signalling genes in the pig genome
the roslin-cambridge porcine rh panel  <cit>  was screened with six tlr-related genes,  <dig> other genes and  <dig> microsatellite markers, all predicted to be on porcine chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  based on comparative analysis of the pig fingerprinted contig  map  <cit> .

rh map of pig chromosome 8
fifty-nine markers  were assigned to five linkage groups at lod <dig> on porcine chromosome  <dig> , which themselves were ordered into two groups corresponding to both arms  of the chromosome using markers in common with the marc v <dig> porcine linkage map  <cit>  as the scaffold . the length of ssc8a and b was  <dig>  centiray  and  <dig>  cr, respectively. the resulting rh maps showed a very consistent marker order when compared to the marc v <dig> map . the here created maps are publicly available in the arkdb database  <cit> . four tlr genes were assigned to this chromosome; tlr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are closely linked between  <dig>  and  <dig>  cr on ssc8a, whereas tlr <dig> maps at  <dig>  cr on ssc8b .

rh map of pig chromosome 13
thirty-nine markers  were assigned to  <dig> linkage groups at lod <dig> on porcine chromosome  <dig> , which themselves were ordered along the chromosome using markers in common with the marc v <dig> map  <cit>  as the scaffold. the total map length was  <dig>  cr.

comparison with the marc v <dig> map displays a very consistent marker order . the resulting rh map is now publicly available at the arkdb database  <cit> . myd <dig> was located on this chromosome at  <dig>  cr and tlr <dig> at  <dig>  cr.

comparison with the porcine fpc map
eighteen of the  <dig> tlr and associated signalling genes could be localised using comparative information between the porcine fpc map and the human whole genome sequence  <cit> . two genes  could not be assigned to a position in the porcine fpc map because a  <dig> mb human sequence fragment surrounding the localisation of the genes produced no significant alignment with any porcine clone mapped on the fpc map. of the  <dig> genes with predicted locations, six  were mapped on the porcine rh map using the cambridge-roslin rh panel . the positions for tlr <dig> on ssc <dig> and tlr <dig> on ssc <dig> on the fpc map agree with another study  <cit> . thus, in-silico positions were confirmed by lab based mapping techniques for seven of the  <dig> tlr-related genes . in addition, an alignment of publicly available porcine mrna sequences of the genes against the current pre-assembled htgs  pig sequence database  <cit>  resulted in  <dig> alignments which all confirmed the positions predicted by the fpc map .

localisation of tlr and signalling genes in the sheep genome
in-silico and radiation hybrid mapping in sheep
all  <dig> tlr-related genes could be localised in the virtual sheep genome  <cit> . in order to confirm these in-silico positions , primers for the  <dig> genes  were used to screen the usu orh <dig> ovine radiation hybrid panel  <cit>  to analyse linkage with previously assigned markers on the ovine rh map. significant linkage was demonstrated for  <dig> of the  <dig> loci by lod scores greater than  <dig>  allowing an assignment of the loci to the ovine rh map and a comparison to the in-silico position predicted by the virtual sheep genome .

markers marked by  have lod scores < 5

the remaining four genes were linked to markers on the ovine rh map but with lod scores of ≤  <dig> . one of these four genes  was tentatively linked to a marker on chromosome  <dig> , the same location predicted by the virtual sheep genome. therefore, while the lod score for the rh mapping was not significant, the rh analysis supported the in-silico position . three genes were tentatively assigned on the rh map to locations other than predicted by the virtual sheep genome  or unlinked to any other marker  but all three had non-significant lod scores , suggesting that the location predicted by the virtual sheep genome was more plausible than the rh location .

in summary, the predicted positions of  <dig> genes on the virtual sheep genome were confirmed  or supported  by rh mapping. the remaining three genes were not positioned with confidence on the rh map so the positions predicted by the virtual sheep genome could not be confirmed.

homologous regions affecting related traits in several species
genomic coordinates of the tlr-related genes were compared with the locations of health-related qtls in pig, sheep, cattle, human and mouse . six of the analysed genes are located in homologous qtl regions which control the susceptibility to the same or a closely related pathogen in several species. five of them  are functionally involved in immune responses against the qtl associated pathogens . in addition association studies have linked polymorphic variants of human and murine tlr <dig>   <dig> and irf <dig> with susceptibility to relevant diseases. further evidence arises also for myd <dig> by differential expression in mouse strains of divergent resistance post infection with trypanosoma congolense which is of particular interest because of the ambiguous involvement of myd <dig> into the control of protozoan infections  <cit> .

these four genes are located in qtl regions which harbour further immunologically relevant genes. assuming that homologous qtls are controlled by the same genes in several species, the qtl span was narrowed down to the common block of conserved gene synteny among the species .

irf <dig> is located in a region affecting health traits in all five species, but the qtl controls host responses for a wide range of pathogens . the homologous qtl overlap among mouse, human, cattle and sheep comprises two blocks of conserved gene synteny between these species and has a combined extent of approximately  <dig> mb . the region contains in human, mouse and cattle  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. seventy-seven of them are listed in the innatedb non-redundant gene list of immune-related murine or humane genes  <cit>  . eight genes were considered as functionally relevant according to their gene ontology  annotation .

myd <dig> is located in a qtl related to protozoan infections in cattle and mice . there are four regions of conserved synteny between bovine chromosome  <dig> and murine chromosome  <dig> which are differentially ordered and orientated between both species. together they comprise approximately  <dig> mb, within which the parasite-related qtls in mouse and cattle overlap . both qtls share an area which in cattle and mouse comprises  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. thirty-eight genes are listed in the innatedb non-redundant gene list of immunologically relevant murine or human genes  <cit>   and six were considered as functionally relevant according to their go annotation .

the homologous qtl regions overlaying the tlr <dig> family cluster controls bacterial infections in three species . their  <dig> mb overlap region  contains in human, cattle and mouse  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. out of those  <dig> genes are listed in the innatedb non-redundant gene list of immunologically relevant murine or bovine genes  <cit>  .

the go annotation indicates that four of them are involved in immune responses and therefore might be functionally relevant .

discussion
reliability of the pig fpc map
it was the aim of this study to use information from different sources to infer the location of  <dig> porcine tlr-related genes. the gene content of the pig bacterial artificial chromosome  clones predicted on the basis of bes  alignments with the human genome has been validated by subsequent sequencing of bacs in the pig genome project  <cit> , suggesting that the fpc map is a solid tool to identify gene locations. in addition to the in-silico information deduced from the pig fpc map  <cit>  and the blast analysis of the pig htgs sequence database  <cit>  we also determined the location of several of the genes using the roslin-cambridge porcine radiation hybrid panel  <cit> . we performed the rh analysis on porcine chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> because these two chromosomes were expected to harbour six genes of which the position of five is of particular interest. the common location of tlr <dig> with the tlr <dig> family cluster on one chromosome is unique to pig and human. the molecules of the tlr <dig> family  broaden their ligand spectrum by heterodimerisation with tlr <dig> which is then signalled via a myd <dig> dependent pathway  <cit> . it is striking that in human and pig these closely interacting molecules are linked together, whereas in other species they are on different chromosomes. this merits a more detailed analysis of the involved genomic region.

the high consistency of the marker order between the marc v <dig>  <cit>  and rh maps  and the confirmation of the predicted positions with all six genes mapped using rh techniques confirms that the fpc map is a reliable source of mapping information.

reliability of the virtual sheep genome
the virtual sheep genome  <cit>  has been established by aligning bac end sequence data from the chori- <dig> ovine bac library against the sequences from the human , bovine  and canine  genomes, and anchoring those with the ovine linkage map . the three inconsistencies between the virtual sheep genome and rh positions in this study  are likely due to limited loci on the rh map resulting in non-significant linkage, which could be resolved in the near future by adding additional markers to the rh map. thus, the confirmation of  <dig> of the  <dig> genes by rh mapping using the usuorh <dig> panel  <cit>  suggests that the in-silico approach for predicting gene positions using the virtual sheep genome holds great promise.

combined approach to identify health related candidate genes
particularly in mice a multitude of health related qtls cover relatively large proportions of the chromosomes so that the localisation of the genes within such a region provides rather limited evidence for an involvement into the mechanisms shaping the variation of the trait. however, homologous qtl regions can be narrowed by including comparative information from other species  <cit> . the more the size of the inter-specific qtl region can be reduced, the greater becomes the support for the candidate genes within this region.

the relationships of a gene to a phenotype can also be indicated by its functional relevance or by expression patterns which differ among phenotypes. hence we pursue a combined approach which can provide much stronger evidence.

genes within homologous qtl overlaps can be selected based on their ontology. functional relevance has often been deduced from other species. this approach is not always reliable, as gene functions might change during evolution leading to limited differences among species  <cit> . for example in mice  <dig> tlrs are known  <cit> , but only  <dig> of the tlr1- <dig> which are common in most mammals are functional in mice. however, the functional differences between mammals are relatively small and it can therefore be assumed that the gene function established in one mammalian species can in most cases be extrapolated to the others.

in addition differential expression patterns indicate that the genes might be involved in the mechanism resulting in phenotypic differences, either as a consequence of a polymorphism in an upstream gene or in the gene itself. however, genes can also be associated with a divergent phenotype without a related difference in expression. also, differential expression patterns do not necessarily indicate a direct involvement of a gene in the phenotype.

therefore a combination of approaches is necessary and can provide much stronger evidence for or against the involvement of candidate genes in variations of disease resistance traits .

qtl regions and candidate genes
irf <dig> and linked genes
the wide range of pathogens controlled by the qtl seems to suggest that different genes might be responsible for the qtl effect in the different species. in the pig, it is likely that the qtl affecting escherichia  coli resistance is caused by a polymorphism in the fut <dig>  gene which is closely linked to irf <dig>  <cit> . the fut <dig> enzyme modifies a structure that enables specific binding of e. coli  to the intestinal mucosa and therefore could not explain the qtl effects on the non-bacterial pathogens in the other species .

for tyrobp  some evidence for adaptive selection within cattle populations has been found  <cit> , indicating that polymorphism might influence resistance traits in cattle. tyrobp activates natural killer  cells and therefore plays an important role in anti-viral defence  <cit>  and could explain the human coxsackie virus resistance locus, but not the overlapping qtls in the other species.

to date only polymorphisms in irf <dig> and fcgrt  have been associated with relevant health traits. the fcgrt binds igg, and serves to transfer igg to mucosal surfaces. in ruminants and pigs it is likely to be particularly important in colostral immunoglobulin transfer to newborns as it is expressed in the newly lactating mammary gland. however, it is also expressed in adult mammalian tissues  <cit> . fcgrt haplotypes have been associated with the capacity to transfer igg from cow to calf in beef cattle  <cit> , which is of upmost importance in newborn, but not in adult animals on which the underlying phenotypic data of the discussed qtl studies are based on. hence there is not sufficient evidence for the involvement of fcgrt polymorphism into the variation caused by the qtls. an irf <dig> polymorphism in mice alters induction of ifn-β response and affects resistance to listeria infections  <cit> . pathogens which use the same underlying mechanism of a pathogen-driven induction of ifn-β transcription to reduce the host's defence would probably also be affected by a similar polymorphism in irf <dig> 

all pathogens related to the qtls in all analysed species can potentially be recognized by tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> which can activate an immune response via a myd <dig> independent pathway resulting in activation of irf <dig>  <cit> . in addition multiple other tlr independent pathways which are activated by pathogen recognition can result in activation of irf <dig>  <cit> . polymorphisms altering irf <dig> transcript levels could therefore affect the resistance to a range of pathogens. this indeed was observed in resistant c57bl/ <dig> mice compared to susceptible a/j mice nine days post infection with trypanosoma congolense .

for the other potentially relevant genes located in the homologous qtl regions  to our knowledge no results suggesting an involvement of these genes in the qtl effects have been reported. assuming, that one common gene is underlying the same qtl in sheep, cattle, mouse and human, irf <dig> would be a compelling candidate.

myd <dig> and linked genes
the qtl effect on the susceptibility to trypanosoma congolense infections in cattle  <cit>  and plasmodium chabaudi infections in mice  <cit>  might be related, as both diseases are the result of protozoan infections which presumably carry similar pamps and activate the same pathways. the chromosomal overlap of these qtls suggests that they could be caused by the same genes in both species, while a connection with an overlapping qtl for borrelia burgdorferi in mice is less obvious  <cit> . to date no evidence of differential expression has been reported for any of the six potentially qtl related genes  in response to infections in pig, cattle or sheep. however, expression studies in mice show that three genes are differentially expressed in divergent mouse phenotypes post infection with trypanosoma congolense  <cit>  which includes myd <dig>  chemokine  receptor  <dig> , and chemokine binding protein  <dig>  and one post infection with yersinia enterocolitica   <cit> .

there are multiple chemokine receptors and ligands which are involved in the trafficking of leukocytes  <cit> . although several of them are coded in the region around myd <dig> in the so-called chemokine receptor cluster, the comparative genomic approach  excluded several of them due to their localisation. polymorphisms in a number of chemokine receptors are associated with susceptibility and resistance to human immunodeficiency virus  infection  <cit> . the chemokine receptor genes have also been investigated as possible candidates for health traits in livestock  <cit> . however, to date no significant associations of the chemokine receptors located in the homologous qtl with protozoan infections have been detected.

in contrast, myd <dig> is due to its central position as an adaptor molecule involved in the immune responses to many different pathogens, including protozoa . myd <dig> has been associated with a protective effect during infection with trypanosoma  <cit>  and toxoplasma  <cit>  strains. interestingly, during malaria infections myd <dig> signalling is involved in an excessive cytokine production which is responsible for most of the clinical symptoms  <cit> . thus, a hypothetical myd <dig> polymorphism affecting the gene function could balance protection against different protozoan parasites. however, to date no evidence for such polymorphism is available. it can therefore concluded, that further investigations are required to elucidate the role of myd <dig>  cx3cr <dig> or ccbp <dig> in the variation caused by the qtl.

tlr <dig> gene family cluster and linked genes
the association of this chromosomal location with the susceptibility to bacterial infections in cattle   <cit>  and mice   <cit>  is consistent with the function of tlr <dig> and  <dig> and polymorphisms within these genes have been associated with tuberculosis  <cit>  and malaria  <cit>  in humans. the association with malaria suggests together with the differential expression in divergent mouse, sheep and cattle phenotypes post infection with protozoan or other parasites , that the tlr <dig> family cluster might also be involved in the recognition of further yet unknown ligands. the ligand for tlr <dig> is still unknown. however, tlr <dig> is not functional in mice and must therefore be excluded as a common candidate for both species, although it remains a possible candidate gene for the mastitis related qtl in cattle.

another relevant gene, rfc <dig> , had higher transcript levels in bone marrow-derived macrophages  isolated from disease susceptible balb/c mice than from resistant c57bl/ <dig> mice post infection with yersinia enterocolitica. this indicates that different variants might play a divergent role in the disease response. the rfc <dig> go annotation points among others to its involvement in the defence , which includes recovery functions such as dna repair. however, to our knowledge no gene functions linking rfc <dig> directly with a mechanism which could be responsible for the trait variations are known and its low expression in resistant mice might simply reflect reduced requirement for dna repair in more resistant animals. it can therefore be concluded that the tlr <dig> family gene cluster is the most likely candidate for the overlaying qtls.

CONCLUSIONS
a comparative approach enabled us to identify tlr-related genes in regions of conserved synteny among mammals that affect related traits in several species. we investigated their functional relevance for the trait in question, reviewed expression studies and analysed further immune related genes located in the regions. with the increasing availability of qtl and expression data, this approach could be extended to identify additional genes of economic interest in livestock and also to provide new insights into complex phenotypes in humans.

the genes involved in tlr signalling are suggested to be candidates for health traits in mammalian species. the most compelling evidence for involvement in pathogen susceptibility traits has been demonstrated for tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  myd <dig> and irf <dig>  due to their close linkage and their functions or expression patterns some evidence suggests in addition fcgrt, cx3cr <dig>  ccbp <dig> and tlr <dig> as further potential candidate genes. for fcgrt, tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> snps have been established in pig  <cit>  and cattle  <cit> . the other genes could be screened for snps which could then be tested for associations with health related traits in livestock.

the other tlr-related genes and further closely linked genes might be involved in mechanisms shaping immune related traits, although they were not considered here due to the limited availability of evidence. additional investigations of polymorphisms in these genes should be pursued.
