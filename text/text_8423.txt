BACKGROUND
cotton is one of the most important fiber crop and the third important oil crop in the world  <cit> . it also serves as a model species for studies of the cell elongation process in plant biology  <cit> .

cotton fibers, known as the cotton lint, are single-celled trichomes that differentiate from single cells in the epidermis of the ovule. cotton fiber development consists of four periods: fiber initiation, fiber elongation, secondary cell wall biosynthesis and maturation . fiber length  is predominantly determined during the fiber elongation stage . during the fast elongation period at 5– <dig> dpa, fiber cells expand vigorously, with peak growth rates of >2 mm/day in upland cotton  <cit> , and the maximum elongation rate occurs at  <dig> dpa  <cit> . a number of studies have demonstrated that cotton fiber development is a complex biological process that involves dynamic transcriptional regulatory networks . fast-growing fiber cells were originally reported to expand via a tip-growth model  <cit>  and a diffuse-growth model  <cit> . recently, a combined linear cell growth model encompassing both the tip-growth model and diffuse-growth model was proposed  <cit> . in this model, very-long-chain fatty acids  promote fiber growth by activating ethylene biosynthesis to stimulate pectin biosynthesis and scaffold establishment; and ca2+, ca2+-dependent protein kinase, reactive oxygen species  and sucrose synthase are also involved in fiber cell elongation  <cit> . however, these models do not explain the molecular mechanism underlying natural genetic differences between genotypes differing in fl.

numerous differentially expressed genes have been identified during the fiber elongation stage in cotton using cloning and sequencing of cdna libraries  and microarrays . although many microarray-based gene expression studies have attempted to address the molecular aspects of fiber cell elongation using fiberless mutants or different species, this process remains unclear. rna sequencing  has emerged as a high-throughput, low-cost next-generation sequencing  technique that provides a powerful technological platform to identify genes related to traits/treatments of interest, with or without genome information as a reference. several studies regarding cotton fibers that have used ngs techniques have been published .

although many gene expression studies on fiber development have been reported, several issues are noted here. first, most of differentially expressed genes  identified from the comparative analysis between different species  are related to differences between species and are unlikely to be associated with fiber development or fiber traits. therefore, near-isogenic lines   <cit>  or backcross inbred lines  with the same genetic background should be used. in the case of chromosome segment introgression lines  used  <cit> , the numbers of rna-seq reads were not high enough for a comprehensive genome coverage. second, in the case of previous studies using microarrays, one of the limitations of microarrays such as affymetrix genechips is the number of probes representing genes  spotted on the genechip, which is far less than that predicted in the sequenced diploid and tetraploid cotton genomes . understandably, many degs were not detected by microarray analysis. third, in a few cases, the use of the predicted protein-coding gene sequences from g. raimondii and g. arboreum for gene annotation in tetraploid cotton may not be accurate enough. with the publication and availability of the tetraploid  genome sequence  <cit> , high-throughput ngs can identify most, if not all, of the expressed genes related to fiber quality traits including fl. fourth, whether any of the degs identified from previous studies had sequence differences between a fiber mutant and its wild-type or between a csil and its recurrent parent is unknown. only the degs that have sequence variations and also co-localize with fiber traits of interest  are possible candidates for further studies. however, this positional candidate approach has not been used to identify genes for genetic variation in fl of cotton.

in plant breeding, molecular markers are extremely helpful for characterizing genetic variations, linkage mapping and marker-assisted selection   <cit> . the narrow genetic base and allotetraploid genome nature of cotton made the discovery of snps difficult  <cit> . the use of high-throughput sequencing techniques has made it possible to detect a large number of snp markers . however, a genome-wide coding sequence-based snp discovery based on rna-seq has not been reported using the sequenced tetraploid genome sequence.

in the past 20 years, numerous studies have reported a collection of qtl including fl qtl identified from a number of g. hirsutum × g. barbadense interspecific populations  <cit> . however, no candidate genes for these qtl have been identified. currently, a genome-wide expression study of a large number of lines during fiber development is still cost prohibitive. to circumvent this problem, lines with the same genetic background such as nils or bils may be useful. in this study, rna-seq libraries were constructed and sequenced for a comparative analysis from the fast elongation fibers at  <dig> dpa between two bils . the two lines shared 95% of dna markers and had similar phenotypes but a significant difference in fl  and micronaire, and were selected from  <dig> bils with  <dig> qtl for fl identified  <cit> . the objective of this study was to gain an understanding of molecular aspects of fiber elongation between the two bils and to identify fl candidate genes as potential targets. the rna-seq depth was extremely high to cover the expressed upland cotton genome in developing cotton fibers, and the resulting sequence reads were annotated using the published upland cotton genome sequence as the reference  <cit> . our hypothesis was that genes responsible for the genetic difference in fl  between the two bils are among those genes that are differentially expressed in developing fibers with dna sequence differences and co-localize with fl qtl. this study represents one of the first investigations of positional candidate gene approach of qtl in cotton in integrating transcriptome and snp identification based on rna-seq with linkage and physical mapping of qtl and genes, which will facilitate the eventual cloning and identification of genes responsible for fl qtl.

RESULTS
fiber growth kinetics of the two bils
the mature fl of “long”  and “short”  bils averaged  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm, respectively, as described previously  <cit>   and were selected for their differences in fl and similarities in other agronomic and fiber quality traits except for micronaire. similar to g. barbadense, “long” had longer and finer  fibers, as fiber length and fineness are often negatively correlated. their highly similar genetic background was also evident in that they were identical in  <dig> % of the ssr and snp markers assayed , which is suitable for the current comparative analysis.

in this study, we measured the dynamic changes in fl of the two bils at several fiber developmental time points  to reveal the different features of fl development. the “long” line had longer fl than the “short” line and increased approximately exponentially from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa . the elongation rate at  <dig> dpa was shown to be the highest, with a significant difference in the fl between the two bils . therefore,  <dig> dpa developing fibers from these two bils were chosen to study the molecular aspects of fiber elongation, although there may be other genes specifically expressed in fibers prior to or after  <dig> dpa.fig.  <dig> the dynamic change in fiber length during development. a “long” and “short” cotton fiber lengths at different developmental stages. b “long” and “short” cotton fiber elongation rates at different developmental stages. error bars show the standard errors calculated from three replicates. * indicates a significant difference at p =  <dig>  between “long” and “short” at a given dpa




overview of rna sequencing data
to obtain a global insight into the characteristics of the transcriptome of elongating fibers, cdna libraries for the fast elongation stage at  <dig> dpa were constructed and sequenced using an illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. after trimming off the adapter sequences and removing the low-quality reads, we obtained  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads for “long” and “short”, respectively, with a single read length of 90 bp and a q <dig> percentage  over 98% . the expressed genome in each line was represented by more than  <dig>  gb , i.e.,  <dig> times the size of the predicted transcript genome of the tetraploid genome . in total,  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  reads for “long” and “short”, respectively, were mapped to the tm- <dig> reference genome after alignment , resulting in the identification of  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts for the two bils, respectively. this result suggests that  <dig> % of the predicted genes  are expressed in  <dig> dpa fibers.

differentially expressed genes with sequence variation
a total of  <dig> degs  were identified between the “long” and “short” fiber transcriptomes at  <dig> dpa using the threshold fdr ≤  <dig>  and the absolute value of log2-fold change ≥ <dig>  these genes included  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated degs in “long”, as compared to “short”.

because the sequence variation in coding sequences  may change the sequence of the translated proteins and the function of the genes, we focused on the snps and insertions/deletions  that occurred in the cdss. as a result, we identified  <dig> snps  in  <dig> of the  <dig> degs between the two bils . among these  <dig> degs with snps,  <dig> % contained a single snp, and  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % degs contained  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and more than  <dig> snps, respectively. these snps included  <dig> transitions  and  <dig> transversions . the snps were further divided into  <dig> synonymous snps in  <dig> genes and  <dig> non-synonymous snps in  <dig> genes. among the non-synonymous snps,  <dig> snps were missense snps that change an amino acid into another, and  <dig> snps were nonsense snps that change an amino acid codon into a stop codon, resulting in a predicted truncated protein. furthermore,  <dig> indels were found in  <dig> degs  between the two bils .

to validate the snps identified by the above analysis, we randomly chose three genes  for pcr using gene specific primer pairs, cloning, and sanger sequencing. the products of the selected snp sites differed among “long”, “short” and the sequenced tm- <dig>  one snp site was predicted in the gene cotad_ <dig> , with a transition at the 66th base . this site was confirmed by the sequence analysis .fig.  <dig> a comparison of sequences between genes from the tm- <dig> reference genome and the “long” and “short” genotypes from sanger sequencing using pcr products. vector sequences have been removed, only the sequences with snp loci between the designed primers were retained. cotad genes are from the cds of the ad genome. a cotad_05094; b cotad_49847; c cotad_40792




the predicted snp site in cotad_ <dig>  was a base transversion at the 179th position , which resulted in the non-synonymous replacement of lysine with asparagine. another transition was present at the 152nd base , but this transition did not change the coded amino acid .

four snp sites were predicted in cotad_ <dig> , including a transition at the 70th  and 83rd  bases and transversions at the 24th  and 116th  bases. all of these sites were confirmed by sequencing with no discrepancies. the 83rd and 116th bases had no changes in their coded amino acids; however, a change in the 24th base led to a stop codon, and the substitution at the 70th base changed serine to asparagine .

degs with non-synonymous snps in fl qtl regions
to better understand the potential impact of degs with sequence variation, we focused on the  <dig> degs with  <dig> non-synonymous snps, while the  <dig> synonymous snps were not considered because of no changes in amino acids. a total of  <dig> snp/indels-containing degs were mapped onto the sequenced tetraploid cotton genome based on zhang et al.  <cit> . a total of  <dig> degs were mapped to chromosome locations from a <dig> to a <dig> on the at subgenome; and  <dig> degs from d <dig> to d <dig> on the dt subgenome. the remaining degs  were on unmapped scaffolds . the numbers of degs with non-synonymous snps/indels were distributed unevenly among  <dig> chromosomes, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> 

co-localization of qtl with degs will facilitate the identification of candidate genes for fiber quality traits such as fl. in our study,  <dig> degs with non-synonymous snps and no degs with indels were mapped with the  <dig> fl qtls that were previously reported in a bil population  <cit>  from which the “long” and “short” bils were chosen, as shown in table  <dig> and fig.  <dig>  the two bils differed in ssr marker alleles in the four fl qtl regions, and the “long” bil carried the desirable qtl alleles for fl. the  <dig> fl qtl, i.e., qfl-07x-c5– <dig>  qfl-07 w-c11– <dig>  qfl-08a-c21– <dig>  and qfl-08a-c12– <dig>  were mapped onto a <dig>  a <dig>  d <dig>  and a <dig>  respectively . the qfl-07x-c5– <dig> locus  had only  <dig> co-localized snp-containing deg encoding an ovate family protein  <dig> , and the snp was an “t” in tm- <dig> and “short” replaced by “c” in “long”, indicating introgression of the gene from g. barbadense to upland cotton. the qfl-07 w-c11– <dig> locus  had  <dig> co-localized degs encoding a putative aldo-keto reductase  <dig>  and a wave-dampened -like  <dig> protein . similar to cotad_ <dig>  one of the two genes  had two snps between “long” and “short” , also indicating its g. barbadense origin, while one of the two snps in cotad_ <dig> was from upland cotton. the qfl-08a-c21– <dig> locus  had  <dig> co-localized degs encoding a proline -rich protein  , a d-cysteine desulfhydrase , a thaumatin-like protein  , and a cct motif family protein . cotad_ <dig> and cotad_ <dig> had an apparent upland cotton origin as the sequences from “long” and tm- <dig> were the same. the qfl-08a-c12– <dig>  had  <dig> co-localized deg encoding a flavin-binding monooxygenase family protein . the sequence variations of these  <dig> genes are shown in additional file 7: figure s <dig>  as stated above, five of the  <dig> genes had a g. barbadense origin based on the identity of sequences between “short” and tm- <dig>  which were different from “long”.table  <dig> a list of identified degs with non-synonymous snps that co-localized with  <dig> qtl for fl

the bil population that included the two bils used in this study only mapped  <dig> qtl for fl, each of which explained  <dig> – <dig> % of the phenotypic variation  <cit> . interestingly, after their chromosomal locations were compared with the  <dig> fl qtl hotspots  from an updated cotton qtldb database   <cit> ,  <dig> of the  <dig> fl qtl mapped in the bil population were also located in three fl qtl hotspot regions. these three fl qtl hotspots, each with  <dig> qtl, were as follows: c5-fl-mqtl-hotspot on a <dig> , c11-fl-mqtl-hotspot on a <dig> , and c12-fl-mqtl-hotspot on a <dig> . no fl qtl hotspot was found to encompass the qtl qfl-08a-c21– <dig> locus on d <dig>  these results indicated the reliability of the qtl mapped in the bil population and provided high confidence in the current study.

analysis of co-localized snp-containing degs for fl qtl
to validate whether degs with snps had any associations with fl measured in  <dig> environments from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> , we designed  <dig> primers  for the non-synonymous snps for these  <dig> fl-qtl co-localized degs. then, a single strand conformation polymorphism  and a high-resolution melting  analysis were used to genotype the  <dig> bils from which the two bils were selected. while the analyses did not detect any polymorphisms in  <dig> degs within the bil population,  <dig> snps in  <dig> other degs  that were co-localized with the qfl-08a-c21– <dig> locus  significantly correlated with fl tested in one or more environments . specifically, the snp at the  <dig> nucleotide  position with an a to g replacement  on cotad_ <dig> highly significantly  correlated with fl tested in all of the six testing environments . therefore, this snp conferred a consistent effect on fl across different environments, indicating a high likelihood of the gene cotad_ <dig> as a candidate gene for fl qtl qfl-08a-c21– <dig>  this qtl was located on chromosome c <dig>  i.e., d <dig>  an example of an hrm assay of the snp at 879 nt of cotad_ <dig> in a subset of the  <dig> bils is shown in fig.  <dig> table  <dig> non-synonymous snp markers in three genes correlated with fiber length

we further used a quantitative rt-pcr  analysis to validate the three degs identified by rna-seq with primers list in additional file 8: table s <dig>  the results showed that the  <dig> degs had significant differential expression between the two bils at the  <dig>  level, which was in accordance with the rna-seq expression results at  <dig> dpa.

the differential expression modes of the three genes during different fiber elongation stages  were further analyzed . cotad_ <dig>  had decreased expression levels in fibers from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa in both “long” and “short”, except for “long” at  <dig> dpa when it had the highest level of expression. the two lines had similar level of gene expression at  <dig> dpa; however, “long” had a significantly lower level of expression at  <dig> dpa, followed by significantly reduced expression at  <dig> and  <dig> . cotad_ <dig>  and cotad_ <dig>  had lower transcript levels in both lines at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa, but much higher expression levels at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa. compared to “short”, both genes were down-regulated in “long” during the  <dig> fiber development stages , except at  <dig> dpa when cotad_ <dig> was up-regulated in “long”. because g. barbadense has a longer fiber elongation period than g. hirsutum  <cit> , the up-regulation of this gene at  <dig> dpa or a late stage may be related to the longer fibers of g. barbadense and “long” in this current study.fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr expression levels of  <dig> fl candidate genes. a-c expression leve﻿ls of gene cotad_ <dig>  cotad_ <dig>  and cotad_ <dig>  respectively. the x-axis represents developmental stages , and the y-axis indicates the relative expression levels as determined by qrt-pcr. the error bars shown are the means of three biological replicates. * indicates a significant difference at p =  <dig>  between “long” and “short” at a given dpa




discussion
the fiber transcriptome in “long” and “short” bils with the tetraploid cotton genome sequence as a reference
we used rna-seq to investigate the transcriptome profiling of two bils using the published tetraploid genome sequence as the reference for annotating expressed genes  <cit> . more than 87% of the clean reads for the “long” and “short” bils were mapped to the reference genome, which is much higher than the average of 70% reads uniquely mapped to the g. raimondii genome reported previously  <cit> . furthermore,  <dig> % of the  <dig>  gene models in the sequenced tm- <dig> genome were expressed in  <dig> dpa fibers, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . the present results provide a most comprehensive overview of gene expression at the transcriptomic level during the fastest fiber development stage.

in this study, we chose  <dig> dpa fibers to investigate fiber elongation with two bils that differ only in fl and its related micronaire  trait. as reported previously, cotton fiber elongation lasts up to  <dig> dpa, while fm is predominantly determined during the secondary cell wall synthesis stage at 15– <dig> dpa  <cit> . therefore, genes identified at  <dig> dpa would reflect these that are likely related to fiber elongation, which was the focus of this current study. it should be recognized that with more time-points during fiber development from fiber initiation to maturity from a set of bils or nils differing in fl or other fiber quality traits, a comprehensive transcriptome atlas can be investigated. however, through a transcriptome analysis and deg and snp identification, in combination with physical mapping and co-localization of fl-qtl and degs with snps, several candidate genes especially cotad_ <dig> possibly underlying the genetic control of fl differences between g. barbadense and g. hirsutum have been identified in this study. this study has paved the way to search for candidate genes for fiber traits in cotton in the future.

a genome-wide coding sequence-based snp discovery based on rna-seq
in the current study,  <dig> degs between the “long” and “short” bils in the  <dig> dpa fiber transcriptome were identified, and  <dig> of these degs contained  <dig> snps . the proportion of degs with snps was consistent with marker polymorphism results based on more than  <dig> ssr and snp markers. these degs with snps were further mapped to the sequenced tetraploid cotton tm- <dig> genome  <cit> . most importantly,  <dig> genes with snps were co-localized with  <dig> fl qtl  identified in a bil population from which the two bils were chosen. the mining of degs with snps in these qtl and qtl hotspot regions helped to identify candidate genes for fl. this positional candidate gene approach based on qtl mapping and sequenced genome physical mapping represents one of the most efficient strategies to narrow the number of candidate genes for a trait of interest.

putative functions of candidate genes for fl
after correlation and qrt-pcr analyses,  <dig> candidate genes for a fl qtl on chromosome c <dig>  were identified in cotton in this study. as the cell wall structure protein, the proline-rich protein  participates in plant growth and development  <cit> . in cotton, several prps were previously isolated, but none was functionally characterized except for ghprp <dig>  <cit> . the ghprp <dig> protein, as a negative regulator, participates in modulating cotton fiber elongation  <cit>  and interacts with auxin-responsive family protein. auxin plays an important role in fiber initiation; the number of lint fibers was increased when the iaam gene was overexpressed  <cit> . in our study, a non-synonymous snp was found in cotad_ <dig> , which correlated with fl tested in only one of the six environments. since its expression was down-regulated in “long” at  <dig> dpa compared to “short”, and its expression level was lower at  <dig> dpa than at  <dig> dpa, this prp gene may also function as a negative regulator of fl in natural variation.

another gene, cotad_ <dig>  encoding a d-cysteine desulfhydrase, catalyzes d-cysteine into pyruvate. pyruvate is a key intermediate of glucose, fatty acids and amino acid metabolism. pyruvate is also related to vlcfa biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid metabolism, and vlcfa promotes cotton fiber and arabidopsis cell length via activating ethylene biosynthesis  <cit> . this gene showed increased relative expression levels from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa and was down-regulated in “long” compared with “short”. a correlation analysis also showed that, of the three non-synonymous snps identified in this gene, one snp at 879 nt  was correlated with fl tested in only two of the six environments. thus, similar to cotad_ <dig>  gene encoding for d-cysteine desulfhydrase may be a important candidate gene for fl.

the most important candidate gene for fl is cotad_ <dig> encoding for a thaumatin-like protein . plant tlps are a family of pathogenesis-related genes. tu et al.  <cit>  proposed that two gbtlps participate in secondary cell wall synthesis, and then munis et al.  <cit>  confirmed this hypothesis. a previous research suggested that tlp <dig> may be a candidate gene for superior fl and fs  <cit> . in this study, we found that, even though both non-synonymous snps at 156 nt and 474 nt in this gene  had significantly correlated with fl, the most consistent effect on fl across all the testing environments was conferred by the snp at 474 nt for the a to g  replacement. further studies are needed to reveal the role of this gene with regard to the natural variation in fl.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the comparative rna-seq analysis of developing fibers between two bils differing in fl during the fast elongation period, with the ad <dig> genome as a reference,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated in the “long” line. according to the fl qtl and hotspots reported previously, we identified  <dig> genes with snp loci in cds regions. proline-rich protein, thaumatin-like protein, and d-cysteine desulfhydrase are potential candidate genes responsible for a fl qtl on chromosome  <dig>  these findings may serve as the foundation for further in-depth studies of the molecular mechanism of natural variation in fiber elongation.
