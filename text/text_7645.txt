BACKGROUND
recent studies, including fate mapping using op9-dl <dig> stromal cells , have allowed for finer discrimination and sequential ordering of a number of discreet thymocyte subpopulations. due to the large number of different surface antigens used as markers for identification of each subset , it has become increasingly difficult to perform comprehensive phenotyping of mouse thymopoiesis by flow cytometry. many investigators have been forced to rely on cell sorting prior to phenotype staining or to focus on either early or late development in order to assess subsets with finer resolution. we have focused on the development of phenotyping stains that target thymocytes across all of the major stages of maturation without the need for pre-sorting. as described below, these stages of maturation can be finely assessed using flow cytometric analysis of a number of surface antigens that are unique to each stage.

traditionally, the major murine thymocyte compartments are defined by expression of the cd <dig> and cd <dig> antigens  <cit> . the most immature cells are negative for both antigens , whereas cells of intermediate maturity are double positive  for cd <dig> and cd <dig>  the dp cells give rise to the most mature cells which are single positive for either cd <dig>  or cd <dig>   <cit> . these four major compartments have been further divided into at least  <dig> discreet subpopulations as previously published by us and others  <cit> , some of which are depicted in figure  <dig>  important checkpoints that determine whether thymocytes live or die are noted in this figure as well. the first major checkpoint occurs in the dn <dig> compartment where only cells that successfully express a tcrβ chain are selected to continue maturation  <cit> . cells in the dn <dig> compartment that are pre-or post-β-selection can be discriminated into dn3a and dn3b subsets, respectively, based on cd <dig>  <cit>  or cd <dig> expression  <cit> . as depicted in figure  <dig> and recently described by us using op9-dl <dig> fate mapping assays  <cit> , dn cells that are pre and post β-selection and those between β-selection and the dp stage can be finely resolved using cd <dig> and cd <dig> staining. it is in the dp compartment that positive selection occurs  and this compartment can be divided into those cells that are negative/low for tcr expression, those that have intermediate tcr expression and those cells that are tcr high/cd <dig> high which are the cells that have just undergone positive selection. finally, the small percentage of cells that mature into the sp <dig> and sp <dig> populations progressively lose expression of cd <dig>  until ready for entry into the periphery  <cit>  and thus can be divided into semi-mature sp and mature sp subsets based on level of this antigen. it is during the sp stages that negative selection occurs .

throughout thymocyte development, the regulation of access and responsiveness to various cytokines is critical to maintaining normal thymopoiesis. for example, genetic defects in the common cytokine receptor γ chain results in x-linked severe combined immunodeficiency   <cit> . il- <dig> is known to be particularly important in modulating thymocyte survival through various checkpoints  <cit> . furthermore, il- <dig> deficient mice have reduced numbers of thymocytes as well as skewed ratios of α βversus γ δ t cells  <cit> . while less is known about the contribution of other cytokines to thymocyte development, engineered loss of the il- <dig> receptor α chain  has a noticeable impact on thymopoiesis  <cit> .

here we describe the use of a panel of commercially available mabs that can be employed to simultaneously identify and phenotype  <dig> thymocyte subsets that span across t cell development. these subsets include  <dig> subsets previously defined by others, and three subsets recently described by us <cit> . we demonstrate the utility of this staining scheme by quantifying the expression of the il-4rα chain  and the il-6rα chain  in the thymocyte subpopulations.

assessment of cd <dig> and cd <dig> expression during t cell development
to show the utility of the 10-color staining scheme, we assessed surface expression of two potentially important cytokine receptors across thymocyte development . the ratios of the median fluorescent intensities for cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  relative to the corresponding isotype controls, and adjusted for fsc differences, are shown in figure 3a . these stains revealed two distinct patterns of expression. cd <dig> expression was very high on dn1a and dn1b early t cell precursors , whereas cd <dig> showed very low expression on the etps. as the cells progressed from etps to the dn <dig> populations, they retained expression of cd <dig> but expression of this receptor waned as the thymocytes approached the β-selection checkpoint . as we have previously published, tcr- and tcrlo dp cells showed little expression of cd <dig> but high expression of cd <dig>  <cit> . the most mature populations of sp <dig> and sp <dig> cells expressed both cytokine receptors. of particular note, cd <dig> was highly expressed only on the most mature sp <dig> and sp <dig> populations  and two very small dn <dig> subsets  that are reportedly not efficient precursors to mature t cells  <cit> .

il- <dig> signaling via pstat <dig> correlates with expression of il-6rα in the cd24losp <dig> and cd24losp <dig> populations
an il- <dig> response assay was performed to determine whether the limited il-6rα  expression pattern shown in figure 3a correlated with a similar pattern of responsiveness to il- <dig> . the cd24hisp <dig>  cd24losp <dig>  cd24hisp <dig>  and cd24losp <dig> subsets were sort purified as described in the materials and methods. cells were assessed for response to il- <dig> as previously described  <cit> . cells were treated for  <dig> minutes in the presence or absence of  <dig> ng/ml of il- <dig> and responsiveness assessed by intracellular staining, using mabs specific to the phosphorylated form of stat <dig> . as predicted from the pattern of surface expression of the il-6rα, il- <dig> responsiveness was most evident in the mature cd24losp <dig> and cd24losp <dig> populations.

discussion
the 10-color stain described above allowed us to easily define the relative distribution of  <dig> discreet thymocyte subsets  and to quantitate cytokine receptor surface expression across development at much finer resolution than previously reported. we have previously demonstrated that cd4-cd8-thymocytes are a mixed population with regard to il-4-induced intracellular signaling as assessed by pstat <dig>  <cit> . in this study we further divided the dn compartment into  <dig> separate populations and a clearer picture emerged of il-4rα expression during early thymocyte development. the dn3a, dn3b, and the dn3c populations exhibited very little surface expression of il-4rα , suggesting loss of il- <dig> signaling occurs in t cell development before cells undergo β-selection. il- <dig> receptor was upregulated in the more mature thymocyte populations . there is an apparent disconnect between the expression levels of the il- <dig> receptor shown in figure 3a and previous findings detailing the extent of thymocyte signaling via il- <dig>  <cit> . we have previously shown that dp thymocytes have diminished levels of il- <dig> responsiveness compared to sp cells  <cit> , which may be due to suppression via socs- <dig> as reported by yu et al.  <cit> .

within the standard αβ t cell development pathway, we show that il-6rα expression is restricted to only the most mature sp <dig> and sp <dig> populations . these populations are defined as semi-mature and mature based on high or low expression of cd <dig> as previously described  <cit> . we also demonstrated that a small fraction of the dn <dig> compartment  also expresses this receptor, however, the subsets of dn <dig> that are reported to be efficient t cell progenitors  were very low or negative for il-6rα. intracellular staining for il-6-induced phosphorylation of stat- <dig>  and stat- <dig>  clearly indicated that only the most mature sp subsets were capable of responding to il- <dig> stimulation. these data confirm and expand on the previous findings by betz and muller who first proposed il-6rα as a marker for mature thymocytes in mice  <cit> . they demonstrated that gp <dig>  is expressed at consistent levels throughout thymocyte maturation while il-6rα is found only in the sp populations. they also showed that il-6rα+ sp <dig> thymocytes represented a more mature population as they were not sensitive to hydrocortisone and were able to proliferate in response to tcr crosslinking, unlike the il-6rα- sp <dig> population. use of our novel staining method, which examined il-6rα at a higher resolution across development, confirmed il-6rα as a marker for mature sp thymocytes. importantly, our experiments using sort purified cells showed that il-6-induced stat signalling is confined to the mature sp subsets as would be predicted by il-6rα staining.

the exact role of il- <dig> in thymopoiesis is unknown; however, it may augment responsiveness of the mature populations to other cytokines. for example, suda, et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that il- <dig> increased the proliferative response of sp <dig> and sp <dig> thymocytes to il- <dig> and il- <dig> in vitro. additionally there is a significant loss of total thymocyte numbers in il- <dig> deficient mice  <cit> . sempowski et al. reported that in human thymus samples, il- <dig> transcript increases progressively during aging  <cit> . interestingly, they also reported that in vivo injection of mice with il- <dig> over the course of  <dig> days led to thymic atrophy and particular loss of dp thymocytes, a population we find to express little, if any il-6rα. given these observations it is clear that our understanding of the role of il- <dig> within the thymus is incomplete and further study is warranted.

CONCLUSIONS
the staining scheme that we present in this manuscript allowed us to simultaneously characterize  <dig> cell subsets that spanned t cell development in the thymus. we found distinct expression patterns of the receptors for il- <dig> and il- <dig> as thymocytes develop. importantly, cell sorting was not necessary to pre-enrich the populations prior to analysis of surface receptor expression, which allowed for rapid phenotyping of thymopoiesis utilizing fewer mice. this method was designed to use only commercially available mab-fluorochrome conjugates in order to allow any investigator with access to a four-laser flow cytometer the ability to employ the staining scheme to quickly and efficiently characterize mouse thymopoiesis in normal or genetically manipulated mice.
