BACKGROUND
panax notoginseng  f.h. chen, which is popularly known as sanqi or tienchi ginseng, is a species of the panax genus in the araliaceae family  <cit> . p. notoginseng has been cultivated for about 400 years in china. it was previously considered a variety of panax pseudo-ginseng, but in  <dig> it was defined as an independent species of the panax genus by chen feng-huai and is now officially named panax notoginseng  f.h. chen. nowadays, more than 85% of the p. notoginseng in the worldwide market is produced in the city of wenshan, yunnan province, china.

p. notoginseng is present in several famous traditional chinese medicinal products, such as yunnan bai yao  and pian zai huang . it is also famous for its haemostatic properties  <cit> . the classification of p. notoginseng from the american herbal products association is class 2b and it is indicated in pregnancy because of possible haemostatic effects. it was reported that p. notoginseng extract administered to rats after cerebral ischaemia reduced infarct volume and inhibited inflammatory inhibitors such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase  <dig> via blocking of the nf-κb pathway  <cit> , suggesting a neuroprotective effect. moreover, saponins of p. notoginseng extract were able to modulate the expression of caspases and attenuate apoptosis in rats following focal cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion  <cit> . in kk-ay diabetic mice injected with p. notoginseng extract, significantly lowered fasting blood glucose levels, improved glucose tolerance and lighter body weights were observed  <cit> . besides the roots of p. notoginseng, total saponins extracted from caudexes and leaves have been commonly used for improving mental function, treating insomnia, and alleviating anxiety  <cit> . the flower buds of p. notoginseng are also used in clinics for treating hypertension, vertigo, tinnitus and acute faucitis in china  <cit> .

chemically, the main bioactive compounds found in p. notoginseng are saponins, which have diverse biological activities such as membrane-permeabilising, immunostimulating, hypocholesterolemic, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-microbial activities  <cit> . the p. notoginseng-derived triterpene saponins include 20-protopanaxadiol and 20-protopanaxatriol, which exhibit opposing wound healing and anti-tumour actions on the vascular system  <cit> . notably, p. notoginseng also shares many similar chemical constituents with asian ginseng  and american ginseng   <cit> . these panax species have species-specific saponin constituents, e.g. pseudo-ginsenoside f <dig> is unique to american ginseng whereas ginsenoside rg <dig> is only present in asian ginseng  <cit> . more than  <dig> chemotypes of p. notoginseng classified according to the accumulation of different ginsenosides in roots, leaves and flowers have been reported  <cit> . p. notoginseng contains significantly higher amounts of ginsenosides rg <dig> and rb <dig> compared with other ginseng species, and the ratios of rg1/re and rg1/rb <dig> in p. notoginseng are the highest among ginseng species. in particular, notoginsenoside r <dig> has been identified in p. notoginseng but is absent in other ginseng species.

several previous studies have suggested that the precursor molecules for triterpene saponin biosynthesis are isoprenoids, which are synthesized via the mevalonic acid  pathway, leading to the biosynthesis of  <dig> -oxidosqualene  <cit> . this central molecule is then modified through various biochemical reactions of its triterpene skeleton, resulting in the production of various ginsenosides. notably, ginsenosides can be isolated from different parts of p. notoginseng, e.g. the underground parts of p. notoginseng are rich in protopanaxatriol- and protopanaxadiol-type saponins, while leaves and flowers contain protopanaxadiol-type saponins only. on the other hand, the ginsenosides rc, rb <dig> and rb <dig> are relatively abundant in aerial parts, compared with the underground parts of p. notoginseng  <cit> . although considerable research has been done on the pharmacological activities of ginsenosides, to date very little is known about the ginsenoside biosynthetic pathway. some candidate genes likely to be involved in hydroxylation or glycosylation of aglycones for triterpene saponin biosynthesis are cytochrome p450s  and glycosyltransferases , but no candidate has been identified for the cyclization step  <cit> .

in addition, p. notoginseng is a shade plant and is commonly cultivated in mountain areas of wenshan at altitudes of 1200–2000 m around  <dig> °n, 104°e  <cit> . because of the humid and warm environment, p. notoginseng is easily infected by pests and diseases, especially in the roots. alkaloids, which have been identified in more than  <dig>  plant species, play a role in protecting plants from pathogen and pest damage  <cit> . however, alkaloid-related genes in p. notoginseng have not been reported previously.

transcriptomic and genomic data for p. notoginseng are very limited despite the pharmacological importance of this plant. considering there are thousands of genes in its genome, only  <dig> mrna sequences originating from p. notoginseng could be retrieved from the nucleotide databases of the national centre for biotechnology information . over the last decade, next-generation dna sequencing technology has provided a rapid and economical way to study the gene expression profiles of plant species. in this study, we established transcript databases for leaves, roots and flowers from 3-year-old p. notoginseng. moreover, we identified genes encoding enzymes involved in triterpene saponin and alkaloid biosynthesis. differentially expressed cyp450s and gts in the three tissues are also reported.

RESULTS
sequencing and de novo assembly
to study the transcriptomes of p. notoginseng, leaves, roots and flowers were collected from 3-year-old plants. total rna was extracted from each part and then mrna was isolated. each sample was sequenced using the illumina hiseq™  <dig> platform. sequencing yielded approximately  <dig> million 90-base pair  paired end raw reads, or approximately  <dig> gbp in total. we filtered out adapter sequences and reads that were shorter than 50 bp, and ultimately generated  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  gbp of high-quality  reads for leaves, roots and flowers, respectively. all of the hq sequencing reads from the three organs were deposited in ncbi and can be accessed in the sequence read archive  under the bioproject accession number prjna <dig>  the hq reads of each sample library were assembled using the trinity software  <cit>  and the tgi clustering tool   <cit> , followed by the phrap assembler  <cit>  to remove redundant trinity-generated contigs. finally,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were obtained for leaves, roots and flowers, respectively. we also pooled the reads from all three organs together and repeated the above steps, resulting in  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  unigenes with a mean length of 781 bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. the length distribution of contigs and unigenes is shown in additional file  <dig>  a summary of sequencing and assembly results is shown in table  <dig> table  <dig>

compared with a separate study of 4-year-old p. notoginseng  <cit> , which generated  <dig>  unigenes , we present three times more and much longer unigenes from p. notoginseng roots . this is probably because of a 48-fold increase in sequencing throughput in this study. the large number of novel unigenes should cover the majority of genes in the p. notoginseng genome and provide a useful resource for future studies on this pharmacologically important plant.

annotation and differential expression of transcripts in different tissues
all unigenes from leaves, roots and flowers were annotated separately using blast searches against the ncbi non-redundant protein , uniprot protein, the arabidopsis information resource , tomato genome  and plantcyc public databases. detailed counts of the annotated unigenes are presented in additional file  <dig>  in total, there were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  annotated unigenes for leaves, roots and flowers, respectively, with at least one significant match in the aforementioned public databases. figure  <dig> shows the number of unigenes annotated by all databases. the annotation percentage for p. notoginseng unigenes  was much higher than that for p. ginseng unigenes   <cit> . when the unigenes from different p. notoginseng tissues were compared, we found that  <dig>  unigenes were shared by all three tissues . on the other hand,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were specifically found in leaves, roots and flowers, respectively, with flowers having the highest number of unique unigenes.figure  <dig>

. the diagram shows the overlapping unigenes in the leaves, roots and flowers. a total  <dig>  unigenes were found in all three tissues, while some unigenes only were found in specific tissues.



we next investigated the transcriptomic similarities and differences between p. notoginseng and p. ginseng using blast searches of p. notoginseng unigenes against p. ginseng unigenes, with an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig>  <cit> . p. ginseng transcriptome contigs were obtained under accession number gaag <dig> from the ncbi. the results showed that  <dig>  unigenes of p. notoginseng had at least one match to the contigs of p. ginseng, suggesting that many of our unigenes are p. notoginseng-specific. next, proteins encoded by our unigenes were predicted by the trinity software and orthologous groups were identified using orthomcl  <cit> , which groups orthologous proteins based on sequence similarity. a total of  <dig>  protein sequences from  <dig>  unigenes were clustered into  <dig>  orthologous groups for p. notoginseng. for p. ginseng, a total of  <dig>  protein sequences from  <dig>  contigs were clustered into  <dig>  orthologous groups. we found that  <dig>  groups were common to both species, with  <dig>  orthologous groups specific to p. notoginseng, and  <dig> groups specific to p. ginseng.

to evaluate the abundance of transcripts in specific organs, the high quality reads were mapped back to the transcriptome generated from all three plant tissues. among the top  <dig> most expressed unigenes in the root transcriptome , one of the most abundant genes was dammarenediol-ii synthase , which is an important player in triterpene saponin biosynthesis in p. notoginseng  <cit> . in addition, unigenes encoding cytochrome p <dig> cyp716a <dig>  which is involved in the conversion of protopanaxadiol from dammarenediol-ii, were also present at a very high level. this is consistent with a previous report about the co-expression of ds and cyp716a <dig> in p. ginseng  <cit> . last but not least, reticuline oxidase-like protein-like isoform  <dig> is a predicted protein with sequence similarity to reticuline oxidase, which is involved in forming benzophenanthridine alkaloids as a pathogenic attack response.

triterpene saponins are synthesized by terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, followed by sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis. according to the putative pathway, specific cyp450s and gts are involved in the formation of various ginsenosides . from our annotation results,  <dig> unigenes were identified to encode all of the known enzymes involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis. there were multiple unigenes annotated to the same enzyme, which may represent different members of the same gene family. table  <dig> shows the reads per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped  values of genes encoding enzymes involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis in leaves, roots and flowers. the rpkms of all annotated isoforms for the same gene were summed as the rpkm of that gene. we identified  <dig> out of  <dig> full-length cdna encoding enzymes involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis and their corresponding accession numbers in ncbi nucleotide databases are listed in table  <dig>  a heat map of differentially expressed genes involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis is shown in figure  <dig>  significant differential expression of these genes could be recognized in different p. notoginseng tissues, and most of the genes involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis showed higher expression in roots compared with leaves or flowers. the expression levels of selected genes  in each part were validated by real-time pcr .figure  <dig>

luo et al.  <cit>  previously analysed the root transcriptome of 4-year-old p. notoginseng and discovered many partial cdnas encoding enzymes involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis. however, hydroxymethyl glutaryl coa synthase , a key enzyme of triterpene saponin biosynthesis, was absent in their transcriptome. in contrast, the hmgs gene was abundant in our transcriptomes, probably because of the much greater sequencing depth achieved in our study. therefore, compared with other published transcriptomes, the transcriptomes reported in this study will be more useful for cloning important genes involved in secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways of p. notoginseng. moreover, β-amyrin synthase , a key enzyme for oleanane-type ginsenoside biosynthesis, was also found in this study. notably, as was discovered in all three tissues of 3-year-old p. notoginseng .

identification of genes related to biosynthesis of different ginsenosides
there are published reports showing that different parts of p. notoginseng differ in the synthesis of triterpene saponins. roots are rich in protopanaxatriol- and protopanaxadiol-type saponins whereas leaves and flowers contain protopanaxadiol-type saponins only  <cit> . it has been suggested that putative candidate genes involved in triterpene saponins biosynthesis are mainly cyp450s and gts, which may account for the synthesis and accumulation of triterpene saponins in specific organs  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> and  <dig> members of the cyp <dig> and gt gene families, respectively, were identified .

it has been reported that the cytochrome p <dig> cyp716a53v <dig> participates in the formation of protopanaxatriol from protopanaxadiol in p. ginseng  <cit> . in our transcriptome, one unigene annotated as cyp716a53v <dig> was found and subsequent sequence analysis showed that it was the full-length homologue in p. notoginseng. figure  <dig> shows the alignment of the predicted protein sequences of cyp716a53v <dig> from p. notoginseng, p. ginseng and p. quinquefolius. the accession numbers of the sequences are jx <dig> for p. ginseng and kc <dig> for p. quinquefolius in the genbank database. all three cyp <dig> genes had  <dig> amino acid residues and showed 98% identity between p. notoginseng and p. ginseng, 96% identity between p. notoginseng and p. quinquefolius, and 97% identity between p. ginseng and p. quinquefolius. it was also very encouraging to find that the expression level of the putative cyp716a53v <dig> in the root  was much higher than that in the leaf  or flower  of p. notoginseng . to confirm the differential expression of the putative cyp716a53v <dig> gene, we analysed its expression level in different tissues by real-time pcr. the result obtained was consistent with the rpkm values, showing that the expression of the putative cyp716a53v <dig> in roots was significantly higher than in leaves or flowers . this may explain, at least partially, why the root has a much higher concentration of protopanaxatriol-type saponins. moreover, this result also indicates that the abundance of target genes in our transcriptomes closely reflects the actual gene expression level.figure  <dig>

identification of candidate genes involved in alkaloid biosynthesis
alkaloids, which are found in about 20% of plant species, are a diverse group of low-molecular-weight compounds acting as poisonous agents in the defence of plants against herbivores and pathogens  <cit> . p. notoginseng grows sub-optimally in direct sunlight and so is often planted under tree canopies, but the shady and humid growing conditions favour infection by numerous phytopathogens, which can cause root rot, black spot or round spot diseases  <cit> .

in this study, three pathways involved in alkaloid biosynthesis were found in our transcriptomes , including isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis , indole alkaloid biosynthesis  and tropane, piperidine and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis . the annotation results from the three transcriptomes were used to identify genes encoding enzymes involved in various alkaloid biosynthetic pathways. in total,  <dig> unigenes were assigned to six enzymes involved in alkaloid biosynthesis . according to the rpkm values of the genes encoding enzymes involved in alkaloid biosynthesis in leaves, roots and flowers shown in table  <dig>  most of the enzymes were expressed at the lowest level in roots, in particular polyphenol oxidase , which has a role in plant resistance to stress and pathogens. it is notable that wounding and herbivore attacks have also been shown to induce ppo activity  <cit> . ppo activation is thought to involve proteolytic processing, but many mature ppos appear to remain in a latent form  <cit> . root rot disease is the most damaging disease that can plague p. notoginseng over its long growth period, leading to production loss and quality reduction. it is mainly caused by fungal pathogens such as cylindrocarpon destructans, cylindrocarpon didymum and fusarium solani  <cit> . in this study, the expression levels of aspartate transaminase, strictosidine synthase and histidinol-phosphate transaminase in different tissues were validated by real-time pcr . further investigation of the relationship between alkaloid biosynthesis genes and plant defence should provide novel insights into the complex disease resistance mechanisms of p. notoginseng.table  <dig>
