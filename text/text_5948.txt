BACKGROUND
the gene for zhx <dig>  was originally cloned by immuno-screening using a monoclonal antibody raised against the endothelial adipose stromal cell line 14f <dig>   <cit> . zhx <dig> was independently identified through studies which demonstrated its interaction with the activation domain of nf-ya,  <cit> . nf-ya is a component of nuclear factor y , a trimeric transcriptional activator. nf-y recognizes the regulatory ccaat element in the proximal and distal enhancer regions of many genes in either orientation, resulting in upregulation  <cit> . nf-y plays a pivotal role in regulating cell cycle factors such as cyclin a & cdc <dig> 

further members of the gene family, zhx <dig> and zhx <dig>  were identified through their ability to form heterodimers with zhx <dig>  <cit> . zhx <dig> to  <dig> are all members of the zinc-fingers sub-family of the homeodomain superfamily  <cit> . zhxs are multidomain proteins comprising two c2h <dig> zinc finger motifs and five homeodomains  <cit> . both homeodomains and zinc fingers are short protein modules involved in protein-dna and/or protein-protein interactions; they are frequently associated with roles in transcriptional regulation.

all members of the zhx family are reported to be able to form both homo- and heterodimers via the region containing homeodomain  <dig>  <cit> . more recently, zhx <dig> has also been reported to interact with the bifunctional transcription factor bs <dig>  transcriptional activation by bs <dig> appears to be suppressed by zhx <dig>  <cit> .

zhxs are ubiquitously expressed in adults with variations in levels observed between tissues  <cit> . biological roles for the zhx protein family are beginning to emerge from various studies. in transient co-transfection assays zhx isoforms have all been shown to function as transcriptional repressors  <cit> . consistent with this designation of function, retroviral insertion into the zhx <dig> locus in balb/cj mice causes, probably in a gene-dosage-dependent manner, the hereditary persistence of α-fetoprotein and h <dig> expression in the liver  <cit> . zhx proteins have been shown to regulate podocyte gene expression. thus zhx <dig> mediates changes in localization during the pathogenesis of glomerular disease  <cit> . it was shown that the level of hetero-dimerisation of zhx <dig> with zhx <dig> or zhx <dig> disfavoured the nuclear localization of zhx <dig>  loss of such heterodimer formation leads to nuclear uptake of zhx <dig> associated with the disease state  <cit> .

the division of multidomain proteins into fragments and use of high throughput approaches to aid structure determination in structural genomics projects have been previously documented  <cit> . we have applied these methods to the structural analysis of the highly modular multi-domain zhx family, where in each case the complete gene failed to express in bacterial systems. soluble proteins were purified and used to set up crystallization trials, leading to structure determinations of both zhx <dig> hd <dig> and zhx <dig> hd <dig>  whilst many 3-d structures of homeodomains have been determined by crystallography and nmr  <cit> , we report two zhx homeodomain structures which contain novel features. additionally, the expression work undertaken here also lead to the structure determination of the double zinc finger domain by nmr   <cit> .

methods
bioinformatics
domain boundaries for zhx proteins used in designing truncations were derived from a combination of amino acid sequence alignments  together with domain designations shown in the ncbi protein database. additionally, low complexity regions as predicted by pondr http://www.pondr.com and ronn  <cit>  were eliminated from the constructs.

cloning of zhx e. coli expression constructs
all zhx constructs were derived using ligation-independent cloning methods by either gateway  or infusion  technologies  <cit> ,  <cit> . expression vectors were made using high-throughput parallelized protocols in a 96-well plate format. descriptions of all constructs together with the pcr primers utilized are shown in table  <dig> 

for the primers only the regions homologous to the target sequence are shown. 5' primers had ggggacaagtttgtac

ccaaaaaagcaggcttcgaaggagatagaaccatggcacatcaccaccaccatcac and aagttctgtttcagggcccg 5' extensions, while 3' primers had gggg

accactttgtacaagaaagctgggtctca and atggtctagaaagcttta 5' extensions for cloning into pdest <dig> or popinf vectors using either gateway technology or the infusion cloning system respectively.

pcr was performed in a  <dig> μl reaction mix using kod hi-fi polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions  with  <dig> pmol of each forward and reverse primers, and  <dig> μl of plasmid dna containing human zhx genes  as template per reaction.

all constructs, with the exception of oppf_ <dig>  oppf_ <dig>  and oppf_ 2465- <dig>  were cloned into the pdest <dig> vector using gateway technology according to the manufacturer's protocols. a shine-dalgarno sequence together with an n-terminal hexa-histidine tag were incorporated into the 5' primer in order to give rise to protein products that did not have translated att sites. the remaining pcr products were cloned into popinf using the in-fusion™ cloning system in the in-fusion™ dry-down 96-well plate format according to the manufacturers protocol . these latter products have an n-terminal hexa-histidine tag together with a rhinovirus 3c protease cleavage site. the infusion methodology and popinf vector have been previously described in detail  <cit> .

expression screening
a  <dig> μl aliquot of each expression construct was transformed into b <dig>  prare and rosetta plyss e. coli , respectively, in a 96-tube format. transformants were selected by plating on 24-well culture plates containing  <dig> ml of lb agar/well, supplemented with the  <dig> μg/ml carbenicillin,  <dig> μg/ml chloramphenicol. incubation was continued for  <dig> hours at 37°c before individual colonies were used to inoculate,  <dig> μl gs <dig>  supplemented with  <dig> % v/v glycerol, 1% w/v glucose,  <dig> μg/ml carbenicillin and  <dig> μg/ml chloramphenicol, in 96-position deep-well plates. the plates were covered with gas-permeable adhesive seals and shaken at  <dig> rpm at 37°c for  <dig> hours.  <dig> μl of each overnight culture was then used to inoculate  either  <dig>  ml of gs <dig> supplemented with  <dig> % v/v glycerol or with  <dig>  ml of gs <dig> supplemented with  <dig> % v/v glycerol and overnight express additives .  <dig> μg/ml carbenicillin and  <dig> μg/ml chloramphenicol were present in both sets of culture media. the diluted cultures were grown at 37°c, shaken at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> hours before the temperature was reduced to 20°c. itpg to a final concentration of  <dig>  mm was then added to the media  with shaking for a further  <dig> hours at 20°c.

a  <dig>  ml aliquot of each culture was then transferred to a  <dig> ml 96-deep-well plate using a theonyx robot  and harvested by centrifugation at 6000g for  <dig> minutes at 4°c before removal of waste media. pelleted cells were frozen at -80°c for at least  <dig> minutes prior to screening for soluble his6-tag protein expression using either the theonyx or br <dig> robotic platforms with standard qiagen ni-nta magnetic bead protocols. purified proteins eluted from the ni-nta beads were analysed on sds-page gels , visualised with safestain™  and the level of soluble expression scored .

expression and purification of recombinant protein
all constructs were transformed into rosetta plyss  colonies then placed on agar plates supplemented with  <dig> μg/ml carbenicillin and  <dig> μg/ml chloramphenicol. colonies from the plates were used to inoculate  <dig> l of gs <dig> supplemented with overnight express additives ,  <dig> % v/v glycerol,  <dig> μg/ml carbenicillin and  <dig> μg/ml chloramphenicol, the media were distributed between three  <dig> l baffled flasks. the flasks were shaken at  <dig> rpm at 37°c for  <dig> hours then cooled to 20°c for a further  <dig> hours. the cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in  <dig> ml of  <dig> mm tris ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm imidazole,  <dig> mm nacl  and, if not used immediately, were stored frozen at -80°c. the thawed supernatant had  <dig> μl of  <dig>  units/ml dnasei  and three complete™ mini edta free protease inhibitor tablets  added. cell suspensions were lysed using a basic-z cell disruptor  at  <dig> kpsi; the supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at  <dig> g for  <dig> minutes. all proteins were purified using his-affinity chromatography on an Äkta-fplc  as a first step. briefly, after loading the clear lysate onto a  <dig> ml nickel-charged hitrap chelating sepharose ff column , the protein was washed with buffer a. the proteins were step-eluted with buffer b . for constructs oppf_ <dig> and oppf_ <dig> the column was washed with  <dig> mm tris ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig>  mm dtt . one ml of buffer c containing  <dig> μg gst-rhinovirus 3c protease fusion protein was then injected onto the column which was incubated at 4°c overnight. the column was then connected in series with a  <dig> ml gst-trap pre-equilibrated in buffer a  to remove the gst-3c protease. the cleaved protein was then eluted at a flow rate of  <dig>  ml/minute. the columns were subsequently washed with 10% buffer b . at this point the gst-trap column was removed, and finally, the ni-affinity column was washed with 100% buffer b. the purest peak fractions  were pooled. all proteins were applied onto a 16/ <dig> hiload superdex  <dig> column  pre-equilibrated in buffer c +  <dig>  mm dtt. protein containing fractions were analysed on sds/page gels and pooled appropriately, with yields as shown in table  <dig>  single zhx domain preps were >95% pure, whereas multi-domain proteins showed lower purity. purified proteins were placed in vivaspin  <dig> concentrators  and taken to the maximum protein concentration possible. concentrated proteins were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen as small aliquots and stored at -80°c. the molecular weights of all purified proteins were confirmed by lc-esi-ms.

an additional construct containing the double zhx <dig> zinc-finger domain was expressed & protein purified leading to a three-dimensional structure determined using nmr  <cit> .

crystallization, data collection and processing
crystallization trials were carried out by sitting drop-vapor diffusion methods with a  <dig> nl droplet size using previously reported robotic technologies, protocols and screening kits  <cit> . crystals of zhx domains were obtained under the following conditions:

1) zhx <dig> hd <dig> : hampton natrix ,  <dig>  m ammonium sulphate,  <dig> mm magnesium acetate, mes ph <dig> . optimisation was via an additive screen based on the above condition;  <dig> mm atp and  <dig> mm phenol were the most effective additives. for crystal cryoprotection during data collection, glycerol  was added to the well solution.

2) zhx <dig> hd2- <dig> : molecular dimensions pactpremier , 20% peg <dig>   <dig>  m licl, hepes ph <dig>  optimization of the above gave crystals with the following additives,  <dig>  m glycyl-glycyl-glycine,  <dig>  m sarcosine or 6% ethylene glycol. the solvent content is 49% for zhx <dig> hd <dig> crystals, assuming two molecules in the asymmetric unit, and 52% for zhx <dig> hd2- <dig> crystals, assuming one molecule per asymmetric unit. it was later shown, during the course of structure determination, that two molecules of hd <dig> were present, v.i.

x-ray data from a single crystal of zhx <dig> hd <dig> were collected in house using a rigaku generator and mar <dig> image plate;  <dig> images of  <dig> ° oscillation were recorded. a total of  <dig> images of  <dig> ° oscillation from a zhx <dig> hd2- <dig> crystal were collected at beamline bm <dig>  the esrf  operating at a wavelength of  <dig>  Å using a marmosaic <dig> ccd detector. in both cases, crystals were frozen and maintained at  <dig> k during data collection under a cryostream of nitrogen gas. indexing and integration of data images were carried out using denzo, and data were merged with scalepack  <cit> . whilst both zhx <dig> hd <dig> and zhx <dig> hd2- <dig> crystals belong to the same space group , they have differing unit cell dimensions as shown in table  <dig>  the statistics for the x-ray data collections are also given in table  <dig> 

structure determination, refinement and analysis
molecular replacement used the molrep program  <cit> with related homeodomain structures available from the pdb as search models, as indicated in the results section.

models were first refined against all x-ray data in cns  <cit>  using simulated annealing and positional refinement with main chain ncs restraints followed by individual isotropic b factor refinement. phase modification and averaging combined with automated model building were then carried out with resolve  <cit> . cycles of model rebuilding were carried out using the program o  <cit>  and alternated with refinement using cns and refmac  <cit>  resulting in the current models which have r-factors of  <dig>   for zhx <dig> hd <dig>  and  <dig>   for zhx hd <dig> . statistics for the structure determinations are given in table  <dig> 

assessment of any 3-d structural similarity of zhx <dig> hd <dig>  and zhx <dig> hd <dig>  to coordinates available in the pdb was carried with either dali or ssm at the european bioinformatics institute, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm. the zhx homeodomain structures have been deposited in the pdb for immediate release .

RESULTS
zhx construct design and protein expression
expression of the full length zhx genes in e coli was not detected, whereas division into a number of smaller constructs, yielded several soluble fragments . domain boundaries for these fragments relied on a combination of information from several sources. thus we used the domain designations as shown in the ncbi protein database, as well as further bioinformatic analyses consisting of sequence alignments and consideration of low complexity regions. where a significant region of predicted disorder was present between domains, that particular combination was not selected. utilization of such analyses led to the design of the sixteen expression vectors for zhx <dig> as outlined in table  <dig>  these constructs were made using gateway technology with an overall 86% efficiency. protein expression in e.coli was assessed using a robotic assay system  <cit> , and showed that 57% gave soluble protein.

zhx <dig> constructs that expressed well in small volume culture  were scaled up and purified as shown in table  <dig>  although the robotic crystallization system allowed the sampling of a wide range of conditions , no crystals were obtained . three further complementary approaches were tried. firstly, three selected constructs were assessed by hsqc to ascertain whether they were suitable for nmr structure determination. oppf_ <dig> and oppf_ <dig> had significant secondary structure  leading to the structure determination of the two zinc finger domain from zhx <dig>  <cit> . secondly, constructs for single domains of zhx <dig> and zhx <dig> paralogs equivalent to the zhx <dig> vectors were made , with 83% efficiency, whilst 33% of constructs gave soluble protein leading to crystals of an oppf_ <dig> fragment . no crystals were obtained for protein derived from any of the other constructs. finally, because of the presence of a flexible polyhistidine tag, which might inhibit the packing of zhx molecules into a crystal lattice, we explored whether tag removal would improve crystallizability. using popinf, which included a rhinovirus 3c protease cleavable polyhistidine tag  <cit> , oppf_ <dig> and _ <dig> were purified and gave similar or enhanced yields of pure protein compared to the untagged protein . forty four 96-well crystallization plates were set up and crystals were obtained for oppf_ <dig> .

crystal structure determination
initial molecular replacement studies using published homeobox domain crystal structures as search models were unsuccessful. the correct molecular replacement solutions for both structures were found by using an nmr structure of the second homeobox domain of human homeodomain leucine zipper-encoding gene, homez  as a search model. the search model had amino acid sequence identities of 42% to zhx <dig> hd <dig> and respectively, 45% and 35% to the hd <dig> and hd <dig> domains of zhx <dig>  the structure solutions could only be obtained by deleting the flexible regions at both ends of the search molecule combined with the use of molrep from the ccp <dig> program suite. no other combination of molecular replacement program or search molecule tried provided the correct solution. the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of zhx <dig> hd <dig> crystal are related by pseudo translation, which was detected both by molrep and from a native self patterson map. after the orientation and position of the first molecule was found by molrep, a solution for the second molecule in the asymmetric unit was generated by applying a translation vector . the initial r-factor for the resolution range of  <dig> - <dig> Å was  <dig>  which dropped to  <dig>  following rigid body refinement. the extremely high initial r-factor is attributable to the fact that the two molecules have an 8° difference in orientation rather than a perfect parallel arrangement.

the r-factor after rigid body refinement was  <dig>  for all the zhx <dig> hd2- <dig> data between the resolution range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å. it became clear, as the refinement progressed, that the two domains were identical and in fact there was a zhx <dig> hd <dig> homodimer present in the crystal . the protein had been cleaved after the crystallization droplet had been stored and the zhx <dig> hd <dig> homodimer preferentially crystallized but in an unusual conformation, v.i.

structural analysis of zhx <dig> hd <dig> and zhx <dig> hd2
inspection of the crystal structure of zhx <dig> hd <dig>  showed that, in addition to the normal homeodomain secondary structure, an extra helix is located at the c-terminal region . the canonical homeodomain structure consists of three helices  interconnected by short loops with interactions to dna made via the n-terminal extension and helix iii/iv. the additional c-terminal helix in hd <dig> we label as helix v in order to avoid confusion with an extension to helix iii, present in certain homeodomains, referred to in earlier literature as helix iv  <cit> . helices i & ii are positioned anti-parallel to one another with helix iii/iv located approximately normal to the plane that is formed by the n-terminal helices . zhx <dig> hd <dig> helix iv is fully ordered although no dna is bound. usually helix iv is disordered in homeodomain structures lacking bound dna  <cit> . helix v in zhx <dig> hd <dig> is positioned almost normal to both the plane of helices i & ii as well as to helix iii/iv, pointing away from the dna major groove binding site on the latter . there is extensive interaction of hydrophobic side chains from helix v and particularly the c-terminal region of helix i. many of the residues involved have aromatic side-chains including tyr <dig>  trp <dig> and tyr <dig> . additional contacts are made with the c-terminal region of helix iii/iv e.g. trp <dig> with leu <dig> and tyr <dig> 

results from dali revealed that the closest structural matches to zhx <dig> hd <dig> found in the pdb were: 1), 2ecc , which had been used to solve the zhx <dig> hd <dig> crystal structure by molecular replacement and 2), 2hdd ). the z factor from dali for homez hd <dig> was  <dig> , with an rms deviation of  <dig> Å for  <dig> equivalent alpha carbons. for engrailed, the z factor was  <dig>  with an rms deviation of  <dig> Å for  <dig> equivalent alpha carbons. comparison of homez  and zhx <dig> hd <dig> shows that the former had little more than a single turn of additional helix at the c-terminus beyond helix iii/iv, although the remainder of the homez c-terminal extension partially overlaps zhx hd <dig> helix v . there is an overall 51% amino acid sequence identity between the homeodomain regions, whilst that beyond the initial turn of helix v is zero. other zhx domain structures available in the pdb viz: zhx <dig> hd <dig>  zhx <dig> hd <dig>  zhx <dig> hd <dig>  appeared more dissimilar to zhx <dig> hd <dig> than did homez or engrailed as the z factors from dali were all < <dig> , with fewer equivalent residues found.

detailed comparison of zhx hd <dig> with 'engrailed', revealed significant differences in the nature of the commonly observed covariant residues found in many homeodomains. thus, in engrailed homeodomain, a network of ionic interactions is formed involving arg15/glu <dig> and glu19/arg <dig> as well as arg15/glu <dig>  <cit> . such interactions have been suggested as contributing to the stabilization of the three-dimensional domain structure  <cit> , although mutagenesis studies indicate there may be an indirect effect of the salt bridges to allow correct side-chain orientations for the optimal packing of apolar groups  <cit>  . by contrast, for zhx hd <dig> the network of ionic interactions is disrupted by the presence of apolar residues: ala <dig> replacing glu <dig> in engrailed whilst met <dig> replaces arg <dig>  additional hydrophobic contacts in zhx hd <dig> are made via the interaction of the met <dig> side-chain and the main-chain of glu <dig> 

the structure determination of crystals grown using protein derived from oppf_ <dig>  revealed a number of unexpected features. firstly, it became clear during the refinement that the two zhx <dig> homeodomains present within the asymmetric unit were of identical amino acid sequence and were not covalently linked, unexpected for protein derived from the bidomain hd2-hd <dig> construct. the sequence of the observed domain corresponded to that of hd <dig> indicating cleavage of hd2-hd <dig> had occurred and that hd <dig> preferentially crystallized compared to hd <dig>  this proteolysis must have largely taken place subsequent to final purification, since at the latter stage the expected size was the predominant species observed by mass spectrometry. the second unexpected feature for zhx <dig> hd <dig> homeodomain was the unusual conformation and dimer formation. the change involved the rotation of helix i by ~180° compared to the usual homeodomain conformation, giving a more opened out structure with some disruption of the hydrophobic core. the effect of the switch on the overall conformation of an individual subunit compared to a conventional homeodomain fold can be seen in figure 3b. a zhx <dig> hd <dig> homodimer is observed in the crystal which is further stabilized by a disulfide bridge formed by linkage of cys494s . the switching of the positions of the two helices i in zhx <dig> hd <dig> provides an example of 'domain swapping'  <cit> .

analysis using dali and ssm revealed only low levels of similarity of zhx <dig> hd <dig> to known three-dimensional protein structures, including all the available homeodomain coordinate sets. thus, this homeodomain conformation appears to be unique amongst reported crystal/nmr structures for this domain class.

discussion
methodology
the bioinformatics studies, particularly the disorder prediction algorithms, were successful in identifying the additional c-terminal region that forms helix v in zhx <dig> hd <dig>  use of sequence alignments alone would have missed this additional apparently integral feature of zhx <dig> hd <dig>  as most of helix v lacks sequence homology with other homeodomains of known structure.

consistent with the experience from many centres using high throughput methods, our study of the zhx family proteins has shown the value of making multiple constructs including those derived from different members of the gene family. a related approach using orthologs rather than paralogs has been recognized over many years as an important strategy in the quest to obtain diffraction quality protein crystals  <cit> . the variation in surface residues in differing homologs is likely to have most effect on solubility and formation of crystal contacts; being the least conserved residues they hence will vary most between different sets of orthologs or paralogs. indeed, the homologous domains from zhx <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> did not show the same pattern of expression. for example, whilst hd <dig> of zhx <dig> expressed as a soluble protein, the equivalent domain from either zhx <dig> or zhx <dig> did not. nevertheless, this work did lead to the structure for one zhx <dig> homeodomain, hd <dig>  removal of the his tag was important for crystallizing zhx <dig> hd <dig>  although only a small sample set was tried as a proof of principle, it may be worth pursuing tag removal if more single domain homeodomain crystal structures were to be tackled, particularly as the tag accounts for a relatively high percentage of residues in a  <dig> amino acid length protein

overall the use of high-throughput cloning and expression methodology meant that many constructs could be tested, thus allowing a number of complementary approaches to be tried in order to maximize the chances of successful structure determination. these approaches led to three-dimensional structure determination for three targets . despite attempts to crystallize protein derived from multidomain constructs, only single homeodomains yielded crystals, which may imply that the linkers between domains have too much flexibility to allow packing into a lattice. induction of rigidity in these structures, which could improve crystallisability, may require the presence of dna oligomers or partner proteins such as additional transcription factors in higher order complexes.

structural
homeodomains, with their common functional role in the regulation of gene transcription, generally show a high degree of structural conservation. as an example, certain homeodomain orthologs such as human hox-a, although separated in evolution by 1/ <dig> billion years from the antennapedia gene, show >98% sequence conservation  <cit> . much greater variation in sequence is, of course, observed in paralog homeodomains reflecting functional diversity, yet in spite of this, the three-dimensional structures are generally conserved. thus the determination of two zhx homeodomain structures reported here with variations in three-dimensional structures from the canonical form is of interest.

in zhx <dig> hd <dig>  helix iv which is in effect a c-terminal extension of helix iii is well ordered, which is in contrast to the higher degree of flexibility observed in the absence of dna  <cit> . the fact that zhx <dig> hd <dig> helix iv is ordered without the bound nucleic acid ligand could be a result of the presence of helix v where its interactions with helix i may help to anchor helix iv residues. it is not clear what the functional consequences of this ordering, if any, may be. certainly a lower level of induced fit of helix iii/iv to the target dna is likely which could in turn affect both specificity and tightness of binding of dna.

for zhx <dig> hd <dig>  the long c-terminal helix  appears unusual in reported homeodomain structures. helix v makes numerous, mainly hydrophobic contacts, with the c-terminal half of helix i. it is thus likely that this additional feature will result in greater stability of the protein. interestingly, hd <dig> from homez, a homeobox leucine zipper containing transcription factor, has a short c-terminal single turn of helix that partially overlaps with helix v of zhx <dig> hd <dig>  there is no sequence identity between zhx <dig> hd <dig> and homez homeodomain beyond this turn of helix. the extended helix v is only present in zhx <dig> hd <dig>  thus demonstrating differences in 3-d structure with homez despite their likely common origin as part of a vertebrate derived homeodomain gene subfamily  <cit> .

alignment of equivalent regions to zhx <dig> hd <dig> helix v in other zhx paralogs  suggests that this extended helix may also be present, particularly in the case of zhx <dig>  inspection of other zhx homeodomains whose structures have been deposited in the pdb , however, confirms the absence of helix v. zhx <dig> hd <dig> has a significant amino acid sequence identity to that of homez hd <dig> of 51%. homez hd <dig> is suggested to have a dna binding function based on putative side-chain/nucleic acid interactions  <cit> . by analogy, zhx <dig> hd <dig> has trp <dig> and arg <dig> in position to form hydrophobic and ionic interactions, respectively, with dna. additionally, the basic n-terminal region present in zhx <dig> hd <dig> is positioned to bind to the minor groove of dna. zhx <dig> hd <dig> also has a significant structural relationship to an engrailed homeodomain  <cit> . engrailed is a well characterized dna binding homeodomain module and its structural relatedness may hence imply a similar biological role for zhx <dig> hd <dig>  rather than, for example, in formation of protein-protein interactions.

from an early study of homeodomain sequences a number of covariant residues were noted  <cit> . thus  <dig> strongly covariant residue pairs were identified, the most highly correlated co-occurring pair of residues were glu <dig> and arg <dig>  from the three-dimensional homeodomain structures it was clear that the side-chains of these two residues formed a salt bridge, as exemplified in the engrailed homeodomain  <cit>  which is one of the closest related structures to zhx <dig> hd <dig> available. for engrailed there is a network of ionic interactions formed by two sets of residues 15/ <dig> and 19/ <dig> which also includes 15/ <dig>  it was suggested that the salt bridges in engrailed could provide stabilization as the small core/surface ratio for such a short protein may require such additional interactions <cit> .

in the case of zhx <dig> hd <dig>  the ionic bridges are broken by substitution of apolar residues at  <dig>  and  <dig> . there are no other residues forming replacement salt bridges elsewhere in the zhx hd <dig> structure. homez hd <dig> appears different again as, although closer to zhx hd <dig> in evolutionary terms,  <cit>  it retains only a single charged side-chain in the 15/ <dig>  19/ <dig> set  and as a consequence has more hydrophobic contacts in this region . also the highly conserved 31/ <dig> salt bridge, which is retained in zhx <dig> hd <dig>  is not present in homez where glutamine replaces aspartic acid in the former and is not even in a position to form a hydrogen bond.

regarding the potential biological role of helix v, it appears to be unlikely to act to form a more rigid link to hd <dig> than those between other homeodomains in zhx <dig>  as there is a significant predicted region of low complexity consisting of  <dig> residues between hd <dig> and hd <dig>  as mentioned earlier, helix v is also unlikely to directly affect dna binding as it points away from the expected major groove binding site. taken together with the increased hydrophobic contacts formed by covariant residues 15/ <dig> in zhx hd <dig>  compared to engrailed, for example, then this could reflect the greater tendency of certain homeodomains from homeotherms to rely more on hydrophobic stabilization, as put forward in a recent pivotal study  <cit> . this stabilization relates to the fact that hydrophobic interactions are entropically driven and the entropy term, in contributing to the free energy decrease, has a negative temperature coefficient, thereby strengthening such interactions at higher temperature. a corollary to this is that the presence of more ionic interactions in non-homeotherm homeodomains such as engrailed may be appropriate for stabilizing the protein over a wider temperature range. alternatively, it could be the case that lower thermal stability may be a desired property for certain transcriptional regulators, allowing a shorter protein half life and thus more rapid response as part of a control mechanism.

naively, it might be expected that any greater stabilisation of a homeodomain could give an increased binding affinity for the dna ligand. however, it has been observed that there is no correlation between homeodomain thermal stability and strength of dna binding  <cit> . thus the need for greater stability of an individual homeodomain may be related to specific functional requirements such as interactions with a particular set of regulatory proteins, for example, rather then representing a general property.

for oppf_ <dig>  the in situ cleavage of hd2- <dig> to yield crystals of zhx <dig> hd <dig> was unexpected as was the non-canonical homeodomain conformation observed in the crystal structure involving a domain swap of helix i thereby forming a dimer. it is not clear that the manner of the generation of hd2: i.e. by proteolysis in the crystallization droplet, should necessarily give rise to this unusual conformation, as presumably it is merely the cleavage of a flexible loop connecting two domains. opening out of the standard homeodomain fold, as observed for zhx <dig> hd <dig>  would likely have the effect of destabilizing the hydrophobic core of the protein. however, the dimer we observe in the crystal structure serves to bury some of the exposed hydrophobic residues at the interface between the subunits.

previously published data indicate that hd <dig> of full length zhx1- <dig> is responsible for both homo- and hetero-dimer formation  <cit> , based on yeast two-hybrid data  <cit> . thus the possible biological significance of a dimer formed between zhx <dig> hd <dig> subunits in this context is unclear. as the homez/zhx gene family is specific to a vertebrate lineage and involved in complex regulatory networks  <cit> , then it is possible that different interactions to those detected in a yeast two-hybrid system may occur  <cit> .

however, a similar kind of domain swapping as seen for zhx <dig> hd <dig> could form the basis for the observed dimerisation of zhx <dig> hd <dig> mentioned above.

even if the unusual zhx <dig> hd <dig> structure is not normally present at significant frequencies in biological systems it is of interest in the context of protein folding, where an alternative conformation exists for the same sequence. the altered homeodomain conformation could form the basis for the acquisition of potential distinctive new functional properties for this commonly occurring protein module.

CONCLUSIONS
the work reported here on zhx shows the utility of high throughput methodology for sampling a wide range of constructs. however, only single homeodomains yielded crystals in spite of soluble expression for some multi-domains. the bioinformatics methods, particularly the prediction of low complexity regions, proved useful in identifying the longer c-terminal region in zhx hd <dig> which turned out to contain the novel helix v, not previously observed in other homeodomain structures. zhx hd <dig> showed numerous additional hydrophobic contacts generated via interactions made by helix v. further, the replacement of some charged covariant residues that are commonly observed to form salt bridges in non-homeotherms such as the 'engrailed' homeodomain from drosophila, by non-polar side-chains further increased hydrophobic contacts within zhx <dig> hd <dig>  and therefore potentially giving greater thermostability, relative to engrailed homeodomain. zhx <dig> hd <dig> helix v would not appear to directly affect potential dna binding as it is orientated away from the major groove binding site on homeodomains. in contrast, for zhx <dig> hd <dig> the rearranged conformation involving movement of helix i, relative to the canonical homeodomain fold, would disrupt the normal dna binding site, however, protein-protein interact is possible as a homodimer is observed.

further work will be required to explore possible roles of these zhx homeodomains in dna binding and dimer formation. this current study, as well as providing some new structural information on zhx domains, has also generated a useful library of reagents for follow-up studies to determine biochemical function.
