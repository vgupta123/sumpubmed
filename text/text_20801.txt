BACKGROUND
transcriptional regulation of gene expression controls many important cellular processes in plants, such as cellular morphogenesis, signaling transduction and environmental stress responses  <cit> . transcription factors  are types of proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to specific cis-acting promoter elements, thereby activating or repressing the transcriptional rates of their target genes  <cit> . thus, the identification and functional characterization of tfs is essential for the reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks  <cit> . in plants, totally more than  <dig> different families of tfs have been identified based on bioinformatics analysis so far  <cit> . the arabidopsis genome encodes at least  <dig> tfs, accounting for about  <dig> % of its estimated total number of gene  <cit> . as for populus, about  <dig> % of its genome was found to encode more than  <dig> tfs  <cit> .

nac  domain proteins comprise of one of the largest plant-specific tfs represented by ~ <dig> genes in arabidopsis  <cit> , ~ <dig> genes in rice  <cit>  and ~ <dig> genes in soybean genome  <cit> . nac proteins commonly possess a conserved nac domain at the n-terminus, which comprises nearly  <dig> amino acid residues that are divided into five subdomains   <cit> . a sequence region of  <dig> residues within the nac domain contains a unique tf fold consisting of a twisted-sheet bounded by a few helical elements  <cit> . nac domain has been implicated in nuclear localization, dna binding, and the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with other nac domain proteins  <cit> . in contrast, the c-terminal regions of nac proteins are highly divergent  <cit> , and confer the regulation diversities of transcriptional activation activity  <cit> .

nac proteins have been implicated to participate in a wide range of plant developmental processes, including shoot apical meristem development  <cit> , floral morphogenesis  <cit> , lateral root development  <cit> , leaf senescence  <cit> , stress inducible flowering induction  <cit> , embryo development  <cit> , cell cycle control  <cit> , hormone signaling  <cit> , grain nutrient remobilization  <cit>  and shoot branching determination  <cit> . particularly, numerous nac domain proteins have also been implicated in plant abiotic stresses and defense responses such as drought, salinity, cold shock, mechanical wounding and viral infection  <cit> . recently, accumulating evidences indicated that a considerable portion of nac domain proteins also play crucial roles in the processes of xylogenesis, fiber development, and wood formation in vascular plants  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, evidences indicated that a subset of closely related nac domain proteins including nst1/anac <dig> , nst2/anac <dig>  and nst3/snd1/anac <dig> act as master transcriptional switches governing secondary cell wall biosynthesis in a partially redundant manner  <cit> . nst1/anac <dig> and nst2/anac <dig> were shown to function redundantly in secondary cell wall thickening in anther endothecium and induced ectopic secondary wall thickenings in various tissues when expressed ectopically  <cit> , whereas nst <dig> and nst3/snd1/anac <dig> redundantly regulate the secondary wall thickening in inter-fascicular fiber of inflorescence stems and secondary xylem of hypocotyls in arabidopsis  <cit> . snd2/anac <dig> and snd3/anac <dig> have also been shown to function in the formation of secondary cell wall in fibers, and their dominant repression resulted in remarkable reduction in the secondary wall thickening  <cit> . interestingly, both of snd <dig> and snd <dig> seem to function at downstream of nst <dig> and nst3/snd <dig>  whereas snd <dig> was identified as a direct target of nst3/snd <dig>  <cit> . vnd <dig> and vnd <dig>  have been proposed to be regulators of the formation of vascular vessels in arabidopsis  <cit> . they act as key transcriptional switches regulating the differentiation of metaxylem and protoxylem, respectively, in primary roots  <cit> . consequently, nsts may activate the secondary wall biosynthetic program in fibers, whereas vnds are proposed to specifically regulate secondary wall biosynthesis in vascular vessels  <cit> . another xnd1/anac <dig>  gene has been revealed to influence the differentiation of tracheary elements and xylem development in arabidopsis by negatively regulating terminal secondary wall biosynthesis and programmed cell death in xylem vessel cells.

although quite a few nac tfs have been functionally characterized in model plants arabidopsis and rice, the functions of majority of nac members remain unknown. especially in populus, the typical model tree species, there are only very limited reports on the functional characterization of nac tfs. recently, zhong et al  reported the molecular cloning and functional characterization of six nac genes in populus  <cit> . among the six nac genes, wnd2b  and wnd6b effectively complemented the secondary wall defects in snd1/nst <dig> double mutant, and when ectopically over-expressed in arabidopsis, they induced ectopic deposition of secondary walls. these findings demonstrated that wnd2b and wnd6b genes are functional orthologs of arabidopsis snd <dig> and master switches activating secondary wall biosynthesis during wood formation in populus  <cit> . shen et al  carried out a genome-wide bioinformatics survey on plant nac domain tfs and identified a total of  <dig>  nac proteins from  <dig> different plant species including  <dig> nac tfs from populus  <cit> . however, only sequence phylogeny analysis of populus nac tfs was performed in their report and no detailed analysis including genome organization, gene structure and expression compendium have been conducted  <cit> . in the present study, we further performed a genome-wide identification of nac domain tfs in populus and revealed an expanded nac family with totally  <dig> members. detailed analysis including sequence phylogeny, genome organization, gene structure, conserved motifs and expression profiling was performed. it is noteworthy that a subset of more than thirty nac genes showed the highest level of transcript abundance in differentiating xylem and cambium tissues. among them, twenty-five genes were further investigated for their tissue-specific expressions by quantitative real-time rt-pcr  analysis. our results may provide a subset of potential candidate nac genes for future engineering modification of lignocellulosic biomass characteristics in populus.

RESULTS
identification of nac gene family in populus
the nac domain genes are plant-specific tfs presented as one of the largest multigene families in arabidopsis, rice, soybean, maize, grape and sorghum etc  <cit> . hidden markov model  profile of the pfam nac domain  was exploited as query to identify the nac genes in populus genome . initially, a total of  <dig> nonredundant putative nac genes were identified. in an attempt to demonstrate the reliability of the identified genes, keyword search with nam against ncbi nucleotide database was performed, resulting in  <dig> members which were all included in the nacs identified above. in comparison to the nac gene family in plntfdb http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v <dig> / <cit>  and dptf http://dptf.cbi.pku.edu.cn/ <cit> , in which  <dig> and  <dig> members were proposed respectively, the  <dig> gene loci revealed in the present study were roughly in agreement with the former. then, the discrepancy loci identified in our studies with the two databases mentioned above were further scrutinized to see if any misannotations were inferred. among them, sixteen genes may represent putative pseudogenes or incorrect annotations, and manual reannotation was performed to correct and reannotate the putative nacs using online web server fgenesh http://linux <dig> softberry.com/berry.phtml <cit> . in this endeavor, seven sequences encoding only truncated proteins were excluded from further analysis. in addition, we combined the newly released genome annotations with the results inferred by fgenesh to make the annotations more convincing. finally, all the putative  <dig> nac genes were further manually analyzed using interproscan program http://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/interproscan/ to confirm the presence of nam domain  <cit> . in a recently published report, a total of  <dig> nac genes were identified in populus by a genome-wide bioinformatics survey  <cit> . in this study, we further revealed an expanded nac family in populus with totally  <dig> members. we designated populus nac genes as pnac following the nomenclature proposed in the previous study  <cit> . the identified nac genes in populus encode proteins ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids  in length with an average of  <dig> aa. remarkably, in most cases, two or more populus nac genes were found for every ortholog in arabidopsis. the detailed information of nac family genes in populus, including accession numbers and similarities to their arabidopsis orthologs as well as nucleotide and protein sequences was listed in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

gene loci are from the phytozome website http://www.phytozome.net/, release  <dig> ). a complete list of the coding sequences , deduced amino acid sequences and genomic dna sequences is available in additional file  <dig> 

the nac gene family in populus is by far the largest one compared to the estimates for other plant species, which range from ~ <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> , ~ <dig> in rice  <cit>  and ~ <dig> in soybean  <cit> . the member of nac genes in populus is roughly  <dig>  fold than that of arabidopsis, which is in consistency with the ratio of  <dig> ~ <dig>  putative populus homologs for each arabidopsis gene based on comparative genomics studies  <cit> . in comparison to its closest woody perennial grape , which possesses only about  <dig> nac genes  <cit> , the nac genes in populus seems to be highly expanded  <cit> . it can be speculated that the presence of more nac genes in populus genome may reflect the great needs for these genes to involve in the complicated transcriptional regulations in this woody perennial species. this expansion appears to be arisen from multiple gene duplication events, including a whole-genome duplication event in the populus lineage followed by multiple segmental and tandem duplication events  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of nac gene family in populus, arabidopsis and rice
to examine the phylogenetic relationship among the nac domain proteins in populus, arabidopsis and rice, an unrooted tree was constructed from alignments of the full-length nac protein sequences . the phylogenetic tree was constructed using mega  <dig>  by employing the neighbor-joining , minimal evolution  and maximum parsimony  methods, respectively. the tree topologies produced by the three algorithms were largely comparable with only minor modifications at interior branches . therefore, only the nj phylogenetic tree was subject to further analysis in our study. moreover, we constructed the phylogenetic tree with the conserved n-terminal nac domains a to e using the same algorithm, which was largely consistent to the phylogenetic analyses performed by the previous studies  <cit>  . as indicated in figure  <dig>  the phylogenetic tree divided the nac family proteins into  <dig> distinct subgroups. pnac <dig> was distinguished from other nac members and formed an individual clade with a robust bootstrap value support  . for simplicity, the subgroups were designated as alphabetical families  based on tree topologies. although the bootstrap values were somewhat low due to the large number of sequences, which was also presented in previous studies  <cit> , more significant bootstrap values in the distal branches allowed us to group the populus, arabidopsis and rice nac proteins into distinct families . moreover, we sought other evidences such as gene structure, motif compositions and expression patterns as described below to support the reliability of the subgroup classification.

in general, the nac members demonstrated an interspersed distribution in majority of subfamilies, indicating that the expansion of nac genes occurred before the divergence of populus, arabidopsis and rice. noticeably, nac genes with same functions showed a tendency to fall into one subgroup, similar to the previous reports  <cit> . for instances, subfamily nac-a encompassed the nac proteins involved in shoot organ boundary delimitation   <cit> , whereas subfamily nac-d possessed all the nac proteins that function in shoot apical meristem  establishment, pattern formation in embryos and flowers   <cit> , stress responses   <cit>  and leaf senescence   <cit> . this group also encompassed anac <dig> and anac <dig>  which have been shown to be induced by abiotic stresses  and to enhance tolerance to drought when ectopically over-expressed  <cit> . the membrane-associated nac proteins that mediate either cytokinin signaling during cell division or endoplasmic reticulum stress responses were clustered into the nac-i and nac-k subfamilies. the members in these two subgroups are distinct with other nacs in that they harbor a transmembrane  motif with a predicted α-helix in the far c-terminal region. in nac-k subfamily, there were only two well functionally characterized members namely ntm <dig> and ntm <dig>  the well-characterized genes in subfamily nac-f included fez, which was demonstrated to be associated with the orientation of cell division in root stem cells  <cit> .

remarkably, subfamily nac-j did not include any arabidopsis and rice nac proteins but only members from populus, suggesting that they may have been either lost in arabidopsis and rice or acquired in the populus lineages after divergence from the last common ancestor. we speculate that these subsets of genes may also have specialized roles with respect to the woody perennial habit in populus. phylogenetic analysis also revealed a subgroup nac-o that contained sequence representatives in populus and arabidopsis but not in rice, indicating that the nac members in this subgroup were acquired or differentially retained in eudicots post-divergence from monocots. in contrast, the subgroup nac-p was composed of  <dig> rice nac proteins, but no arabidopsis and populus proteins, which suggests diversification and expansion of this subgroup after the monocot-eudicot radiation.

the nac proteins associated with secondary wall formation in fiber and vascular vessel development were divided into three independent subfamilies. all nsts  and vnds  were clustered into one subfamily nac-b, whereas snd <dig>  snd <dig> and their counterparts were grouped into nac-q. the other well-characterized nac member xnd <dig> in secondary wall formation was assigned to another different subfamily . all the six functional characterized nst3/snd <dig> orthologs  in populus fell into subfamily nac-b  <cit> . although enormous evidences exemplified that all these nac genes performed as key transcriptional switches in the secondary cell wall formation process, their exact functional roles diversified  <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis conducted herein may provide a potential supporting for their functional diversities. what's more, the tissue-specific expression profiling available on genevestigator lent further supports for this notion  <cit> . the expression pattern of xnd <dig> in arabidopsis was extremely different from that of nsts and vnds. nevertheless, the expression pattern of snd <dig> and snd <dig> was somewhat more similar to that of snd1/nst <dig> and nst <dig> . in accordance with the recent report, nst, vnd, snd, and xnd from  <dig> different species were also classified into three distinct phylogenetic subgroups conducted by maximum likelihood  algorithm  <cit> . another well-characterized gene namely sombrero , which has been shown to control the reorientation and timing of cell division in root stem cells by negatively regulating fez activity  <cit> , was clustered together with nsts and vnds into subfamily nac-b. we inspected the expression patterns of smb on genestigator  <cit>  but failed in an attempt to find any clues for their diversified roles in secondary wall formation. smb was specifically highly expressed in callus and lateral root cap rather than secondary cell wall enriching tissues, suggesting a specific role in cell division and root development .

it is noteworthy that the number of populus genes was generally overrepresented than that of arabidopsis and rice in almost all clades, especially within nac-o subfamily, in which populus nac genes was particularly overrepresented and almost sixfold the number of genes with respect to arabidopsis. alternatively, in subfamily nac-a and q, the number of arabidopsis and rice genes nearly equaled that of populus. in contrast, the number of rice nac genes in subfamily nac-r showed an overwhelming predominance with respect to that of populus.

the phylogenetic tree obtained in this study is largely consistent with previous analyses  <cit> , although there are some discrepancies. the first systematic analysis of arabidopsis and rice nac proteins classified them into  <dig> subgroups  <cit> . however, another phylogenetic analysis of rice nac proteins suggested that the nac family can be divided into five groups and each subfamily was largely diversified  <cit> . in a report concerning soybean nac family, the genes were clustered into  <dig> distinct subfamilies with robust bootstrap supporting  <cit> . more recently, systematic phylogenetic analyses of numerous nac proteins from a wide range of plant species indicated that nac proteins can be divided into eight subfamilies  <cit> . in our opinions, the main reason for the discrepancies of the phylogenetic trees reported may lie in the fact that all the previous nac protein classifications were based on the conserved n-terminal nac domains, either from sub-domain a to d or a to e, which did not take the highly divergent c-terminal sequences into consideration  <cit> . in an attempt to gain better understanding of the phylogeny of nac gene family, we performed the phylogenetic analysis with inclusion of the highly diverse c-terminal sequence. moreover, different algorithms exploited in the phylogenetic analyses may lead to the inconsistent interpretations. in the previous analyses, different algorithms including neighbor-joining   <cit> , maximum likelihood   <cit>  and bayesian method  <cit>  were implemented, which may make the results less comparable.

inspection of the phylogenetic tree topology revealed several pairs of nac proteins with a high degree of homology in the terminal nodes of each subfamily, suggesting that they are putative paralogous pairs  . totally, forty-nine pairs of putative paralogous nac proteins were identified, accounting for more than 60% of the entire family, with sequence identities ranging from 71% to 97% .

chromosomal location and gene duplication of populus nac genes
in silico mapping of the gene loci showed that  <dig> populus nac genes were distributed across all  <dig> linkage groups . in the currently released sequences, totally  <dig> nac genes were mapped to lgs, whereas  <dig> genes were remained on as yet unmapped scaffolds. the distributions of populus nac genes across the lgs appeared to be non-random . lg ii encompassed the largest number of  <dig> nac genes followed by  <dig> on lg v and lg i, respectively. in contrast, only one nac gene was found on lg xviii and two nac genes were on lg xvii. substantial clustering of populus nac genes was evident on several lgs, especially on those with high densities of nac genes. for instances, pnac <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were cluster localized on a  <dig> kb segment on lg xiv, and three nacs  were organized in another cluster within a  <dig> kb fragment on lg ii, whereas pnac <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were arranged in a cluster localized to a  <dig> kb segment on lg xii .

previous studies revealed that populus genome had undergone at least three rounds of genome-wide duplications followed by multiple segmental duplication, tandem duplication, and transposition events such as retroposition and replicative transposition  <cit> . among them, the segmental duplication associated with the salicoid duplication event that occurred  <dig> million years  ago significantly contribute to the amplification of many multi-gene families  <cit> . to determine the possible relationship between the nac genes and potential segmental duplications, we mapped populus nacs to the duplicated blocks established in the previous studies  <cit> . the distributions of nac genes relative to the corresponding duplicate genomic blocks were illustrated in figure  <dig>  within the  <dig> identified duplicated blocks associated with the recent salicoid duplication event, about 73%  of populus nacs were preferentially retained duplicates that locate in both duplicated regions of  <dig> block pairs, whereas nine block pairs only harbored nacs on one of the blocks and lack the corresponding duplicates, suggesting that dynamic changes may have occurred following segmental duplication, leading to loss of some of the genes. in contrast, only a small number of  <dig> nac genes were located outside of any duplicated blocks.

in addition, the tandem duplications might also have an impact on the expansion of the nac gene family. fine mapping analysis revealed the presence of  <dig> pairs of adjacent genes within a  <dig> kb distance possibly due to tandem duplication either in inverse or same orientation . it is intriguing that except for one pair , all the other putative tandem duplicates were represented within the recent segmental duplicate blocks. similar results have also been reported in several other populus gene families  <cit> . these  <dig> nac genes  were represented in  <dig> distinct tandem duplicate gene clusters, with ten clusters containing two tandem genes and two clusters possessing three tandem genes. but further analysis of their similarities demonstrated that most of the tandem clustered nac pairs shared relative low similarities , which may exclude them from tandem duplicate candidates. therefore, ultimately only six pairs of nacs were conformed to the standards as tandem duplicates, which were represented in tandem clusters of two to three genes each. these tandem duplicated nac genes were organized onto duplicated blocks, implying that the occurrence of local duplications was prior to the chromosomal segment duplication.

as a considerable proportion of the nac proteins appeared to be paralogous pairs as revealed in the phylogenetic analysis, we further investigated whether traceable genome duplication events have contributed to the expansion of the nac family. nineteen out of  <dig> homologous pairs remained in conserved positions on segmental duplicated blocks , suggesting that these genes may be the result of segmental duplication event during the evolution. for  <dig> homologous pairs, no traceable duplication events could be inferred, because they are mapped to the yet non-assembled scaffolds. among them, a total of  <dig> genes were located on segmental duplication blocks with their counterparts not mapped to lgs yet. meanwhile, a subset of eight nac genes were located outside of the segmental duplication blocks while their corresponding members mapped to non-assembled scaffolds. taken together, nine genes of the homologous pairs were definitely not located on any duplicated blocks, and only three of them had the homologous counterparts located on the duplicated blocks. duplicates of these genes appeared to have lost from the populus genome. interestingly, one homologous pair pnac <dig> and  <dig> was located on two divergent rather than homologous duplicated blocks, thus we could not figure out any traceable duplication history for this pair of nacs even though they were covered by duplicated blocks.

based primarily on the genomic organization of nac genes, we could conclude that segmental duplications exclusively contributed to the complexity of nac gene family in the populus genome. similarly, segmental duplications have also been shown to contribute to the expansion of other gene families in populus  <cit> . our studies indicated that populus nac genes have been preferentially retained at a rate of 73%, which is much higher than the average rate following the salicoid genome-wide duplication and rearrangement events  <cit> . on a genome-wide scale, approximately one third of predicted genes are retained in duplications resulting from the salicoid duplication event  <cit> . the high retention rate of duplicated genes was also previously reported in other populus gene families  <cit> . these findings are also in consistency with the previous studies demonstrating that genes involved in transcription regulation and signal transduction are preferentially retained  <cit> . another plausible explanation to the relatively high retention rate of duplicate genes in nac gene family may lie in the fact that populus genome has been indicated to evolve at a much slower rate compared to that of arabidopsis  <cit> . the duplicated genes may undergo divergent fates during subsequent evolution such as nonfunctionalization , neofunctionalization , or subfunctionalization   <cit> . whether the duplicated nac genes correspond to genetic redundancy or have evolved divergent functions remains to be further functionally characterized.

the tandem duplication ratio of nac genes in this study is relatively lower compared to some other gene families in populus, which was represented in a considerable higher proportion  <cit> . interestingly, a similar low retention rate of tandem duplicates was also observed for populus arf gene family  <cit> .

gene structure and conserved motifs of populus nac genes
it is well known that gene structural diversity is a possible mechanism for the evolution of multigene families. in order to gain further insights into the structural diversity of nac genes, we compared the exon/intron organization in the coding sequences of individual nac genes in populus. a detailed illustration of the exon/intron structures was shown in figure 3b. in addition, a separate phylogenetic tree was generated from complete protein sequences of all the nac genes in populus, which divided the nac genes into ten subfamilies . in general, most closely related members in same subfamilies shared similar exon/intron structure in terms of intron number and exon length . for instances, the nac genes in subfamily i, iii, iv and vii contained two to three introns while those in subfamily ix all possessed no introns with exception of pnac <dig>  which harbored one intron. in contrast, the gene structure appeared to be more variable in subfamilies ii and v, which had the largest number of exon/intron structure variants with striking distinctions. interestingly, although the exon/intron organization of nacs varied significantly in terms of intron number, the intron phase was remarkably high conserved , which was indicative of exon shuffling during the evolution process  <cit> .

we further analyzed the exon/intron structure of the paralogous pairs in nac gene family to obtain traceable intron gain or loss information about these genes. of the  <dig> paralogous pairs, thirty-four pairs showed conserved exon/intron structure either in terms of intron numbers or gene length . remarkably, twenty-five pairs of genes exhibited a highly conserved distribution of exons and introns, with all members having three exons and two introns. despite a majority of these genes have arisen from segmental duplication events, the others were located either on non-duplicated blocks or on not-yet assembled scaffolds. while the gene structure was conserved between some paralogous pairs, others exhibited some extent of variation. for example, eleven nac genes out of the  <dig> paralogous pairs possessed three exons in their coding regions, whereas their homologous counterparts all contained four exons within nearly identical gene lengths . we could firmly speculate that the differences in the last exons are probably derived from single intron loss or gain occurred during the process of structural evolution of nac paralogs. the conserved exon/intron architecture shared by these homologous gene pairs may reciprocally lend supports for the results from the phylogenetic analysis and the duplication events.

to further reveal the diversification of nac genes in populus, putative motifs were predicted by the program meme , and  <dig> distinct motifs were identified. as expected, most of the closely related members in the phylogenetic tree had common motif compositions, suggesting functional similarities among the nac proteins within the same subfamily . however, the biological significance of most of the putative motifs remains to be elucidated as they do not have homologs when searching against pfam and smart  databases  <cit> . the details of the  <dig> putative motifs were referred in additional file  <dig>  as illustrated in the previous studies, most of the nac proteins possessed a to e subdomains in the n termini that conferred the dna-binding activities. in this study, motif  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> specifying the nam subdomain a to e respectively were present in most of the nac family members in populus, whereas a small subset of sequences did not have all five motifs in the typical nac dna-binding domains. even though the c-terminal regions of nacs were highly divergent, we could also identify at least eight conserved motifs using the meme motif search tool. noticeably, some specific motifs were present in nacs from specific subfamilies, for instance, motif  <dig> for subfamily v, motif  <dig> for subfamily viii and motif  <dig> for subfamily ix. whether these motifs confer unique functional roles to nacs remains to be further investigated.

of the  <dig> paralogous pairs, thirty-seven pairs of nacs shared conserved motif composition with each other, indicative of functional similarities. in contrast, specific motifs located in the c termini were observed for the rest  <dig> pairs of nacs, for example, motif  <dig> for pnac <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  motif  <dig> for pnac <dig>  and motif  <dig> for pnac <dig>  we attempt to speculate that these specific motifs may by some extent attribute to the subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization of the duplicated genes during subsequent evolution processes.

the similar gene structures and conserved motifs of nac genes in same subfamilies may provide additional supports to the phylogenetic analysis. on the other hand, the differences between gene organization and the divergences in motif compositions among different subfamilies may also indicate that populus nacs are functionally diversified.

differential expression profile of populus nac genes
publicly available expressed sequence tags  was considered as a useful means of studying gene expression profiles   <cit> . a scrutiny of the frequency of ests in different databases allows preliminary analysis of gene expression under various conditions and across tissues. the digital expression profiles of  <dig> populus nac genes were obtained from est databases at ncbi , while the rest of other  <dig> nac genes did not have corresponding est sequences in the database. noticeably, the frequency of ests was low with most of nacs represented by a single est sequence, which is consistent with the commonly low transcript abundance feature of transcription factor genes  <cit> . thus we postulate that the absent genes in est database might either transcribe at relatively too low abundance to be detected or had special temporal and spatial expression patterns not examined in the libraries. another possible explanation is that these genes might be pseudogenes, as they only possessed partial nac domains as described previously . in order to gain a better portrait of nac gene expression profiles, we further largely divided the est data into two groups, with one group contained all wood-forming tissues and the other derived from the other tissues. the est digital expression profiles were illustrated in figure  <dig>  figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the expression profiles demonstrated that majority nacs have rather broad expression patterns with presence in diverse libraries. not surprisingly, a considerable subset of genes was preferentially expressed in leaves . in addition to leaves, more than 40%  of the nac genes were especially expressed during wood formation  .

it is noteworthy that several putative nac orthologs between arabidopsis and populus showed strikingly consistent expression patterns, which lend further supporting to the existence of functional conservation between these two species. for example, the expression profiles of homologous pair pnac <dig> and  <dig>  which had two corresponding ests derived from shoot meristem respectively , further reinforced the notion that they are the closest orthologs of nam in arabidopsis  <cit> . the est data revealed that pnac <dig> gene was specifically expressed in active cambium with two detectable ests and highly resembled the expression pattern of its closest ortholog anac <dig> in arabidopsis, which was expressed predominantly in highly dividing and expanding tissues such as callus and root cap .

although the digital est expression analyses provided a first glimpse of the patterns of nac expression in populus, we could not draw conclusive inferences regarding nac gene expression due to the obvious limitations of est data such as relative narrow sample coverage and biases towards highly expressed genes. thus, we performed a more comprehensive microarray analyses for nac gene expression profiles. to gain more insight into the expression patterns of nac genes, a comprehensive expression analysis was further performed by utilizing the publicly available microarray data for populus. firstly, we re-analyzed the collections of microarray data from wood-formation series available at popgenie, a database repository of transcriptomics data available for populus  <cit> . distinct expression profiles were identified for a total of  <dig> nac genes , whereas no corresponding probe sets were available for the remaining nacs in the datasets. the relative low coverage of nacs in the datasets analyzed maybe partially due to the fact that these arrays were mainly derived from ests rather than offered a whole genome coverage  <cit> .

two subset of nac genes exhibited specifically high transcript accumulation in active and dormant cambiums respectively, from two independent microarray datasets  <cit> , strongly indicating their specific roles in wood-formation . in addition, by incorporating the different microarray data, we were capable to identify different subsets of nac genes displaying specifically high expression levels in phloem, differentiating xylem and mature xylems, respectively. the expression levels of five nac genes including pnac <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were peaked exclusively in differentiating xylems supported by two independent microarray datasets   <cit> . among them, pnac <dig> , pnac <dig>  and pnac <dig>  were demonstrated in previous studies as putative redundant homologs involved in populus wood formation  <cit> . interestingly, several genes such as pnac <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were preferentially expressed in tissues enriched of secondary cell walls, whereas a subset of genes including pnac <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed constitutively high expressions in both secondary and primary cell wall enriching tissues . similarly, several genes such as pnac <dig> and  <dig> displayed varied peak abundance of transcript across the same tissues tested among different microarray datasets .

as the previous analyzed microarray are mainly derived from ests and only a small fraction of nacs is present in these datasets, we further seek to use microarray based on whole genome coverage to provide deep insights into the expression patterns of nacs. we have reanalyzed the populus microarray data generated by wilkins and coworkers  <cit> . only six nac genes  did not have their corresponding probe sets in the dataset, and the expression profiles of the rest of  <dig> nac genes were analyzed as indicated in figure  <dig>  the majority of nac genes showed distinct tissue-specific expression patterns across the nine tissues examined . it is notably that a relatively large fraction of nac genes, accounting for more than 40% , were preferentially expressed in male and female catkins. among these genes, thirty-four gene  showed the highest transcript abundances in male catkins, twelve  had the highest accumulation in female catkins, and the remaining  <dig>  showed approximately equal transcript abundances in both male and female catkins. the number of nac genes fell into this category is significantly higher compared to that of myb transcription factor gene family analyzed by the same microarray data, in which, fifty  r2r3-myb genes showed the highest transcript accumulation in catkins  <cit> . the large proportion of nac genes with the highest transcript abundance in catkins may probably attribute to the unique characteristic of sex determination in populus lineage. the previous phylogenetic analysis revealed that these catkin-specific genes were dispersed among different subfamilies rather than divided into distinct subgroups .

thirteen  nac genes showed the highest transcript abundances in differentiating xylems, including four xylem-specific nacs  identified in the previous microarray analysis . the six well-characterized nac genes involved in the secondary cell wall thickening in the previous studies were all included in this category  <cit> . the expression pattern of pnac <dig> gene was inconsistent with the above microarray analysis . the current data revealed the highest expression of pnac <dig> gene in young leaves and female catkins rather than in differentiating xylems. the number of nac genes with the highest transcript abundances in differentiating xylems seems to be a little bit lower than that of r2r <dig> myb gene family, which has  <dig> members accounting for about  <dig> percent of the total  <cit> . in addition, a considerable fraction of  <dig>  nac genes were specifically expressed in roots.

interestingly, a subset of nac genes demonstrated different expression patterns between dark-grown etiolated seedlings and continuous light grown seedlings, suggesting that these nacs may be subject to photoperiodic regulation. strikingly, the majority of nac genes did not show seemingly high abundances of transcript in either young or mature leaves as depicted by the previous ests digital profiles analysis . one possible explanation may lie in the fact of different sample size and coverage exemplified in the analyses.

the high proportion of segmental duplication of nac genes and the preferential retention of duplicates raises the question about their functional redundancy. duplicate genes may have different evolutionary fates: nonfunctionalization, neofunctionalization, or subfunctionalization  <cit> , which may be indicated with divergence in expression patterns. of the  <dig> homologous pairs of nac genes, six genes  did not have corresponding probe sets on affymetrix microarray and were excluded for further analysis. therefore, the remaining  <dig> homologous pairs were analyzed. among them, nineteen pairs were located onto duplicated blocks and three pairs were tandem duplicates. five pairs  out of  <dig> segmental duplications shared the same expression patters with respect to the tissues examined . in addition, the expression pattern of homologous pair pnac004/ <dig> was also supported by a broad sample sets from the previously microarray and ests profiles . although the expression patterns of the rest of  <dig> duplicate genes were partially redundant, distinct pattern shifts can be discerned, which suggested that they have undergone subfunctionalization. these findings indicated that expression patterns of nacs have diverged quickly after segmental duplications, thus the nac genes in populus are likely to have been retained by substantial subfunctionalization. for example, pnac <dig> gene were mainly expressed in young leaves and male catkins, whereas its duplicate counterpart pnac <dig> gene extended to a broader expression patterns in young and mature leaves, female and male catkins .

surprisingly, two homologous pairs  also exhibited almost identical patterns of transcript accumulation but were located onto different duplication blocks . the reasons underlying their highly identical expression profiles remain to be investigated since we could not draw any clues from the segmental duplication events. the rest ten homologous pairs also showed almost identical expression patterns, but we could not locate them onto duplicated blocks currently since some of them were mapped to not-yet assembled scaffolds.

as for the tandem duplicated clusters with three genes, the expression patterns of two of them  were almost identical, while significant diversification was observed for the third member, which may indicate neofunctionalization. for example, tandem duplicate pnac <dig> and pnac <dig> were predominantly expressed in male catkins followed by roots, while pnac <dig> was largely expressed in root followed by female catkin . as for the tandem duplicated clusters with two genes, their expression patterns diversified significantly, indicative of substantial neofunctionalization during subsequent evolution processes.

validation of nac gene expressions by quantitative real-time rt-pcr
to verify the expression profiles of populus nac genes obtained by in silico est and microarray data analysis, quantitative real-time rt-pcr  was performed on seven different tissues for  <dig> selected nac genes. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the genes showed very distinct tissue-specific expression patterns, which were in good agreement with the above microarray and est profiles . for example, in accordance with previous findings, a subset of eight genes among the  <dig> nacs tested were exclusively expressed in differentiating xylem, indicative of their putative roles in secondary cell wall formation. three genes namely pnac <dig> , pnac <dig>  and pnac <dig>  have been functionally characterized in a recent report  <cit> . in the present study, pnac <dig> gene was shown to primarily express in old root, while microarray profiles indicated the highest transcript abundance in differentiating xylems . seven genes showed the highest transcript levels in phloem and four genes had the most abundant transcripts in cortex, which were both enriched in primary cell walls. these genes may have putative roles in primary cell wall biosynthesis and wood development. consistent with the microarray profiles, four genes  were expressed specifically in leaves. accordingly, pnac <dig> gene had the largest number  of corresponding est sequences originated from leaves, which lent further supports to the above statement. all the  <dig> genes tested have constitutively weak expression levels in root meristem. since only a few numbers of nac genes have been functionally characterized up to date, our results presented here may provide some clues for the selection of candidate genes for further characterization.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, a comprehensive analysis including phylogeny, chromosomal location, gene structure, conserved motifs, and expression profiling of nac gene family in populus was performed. we identified a sum of  <dig> full-length nac genes in populus genome, and they were phylogeneticly clustered into  <dig> distinct subfamilies. the exon/intron structure and motif compositions of nacs were highly conserved in each subfamily, indicative of their functional conservation. the nac genes were non-randomly distributed across  <dig> lgs, and a high proportion of nacs were preferentially retained duplicates located on the duplicated blocks, which indicated that segmental duplications contribute significantly to the expansion of populus nac gene family. although a majority of nac genes showed specific temporal and spatial expression patterns based on est frequency and microarray data analyses, the expression patterns of a considerable proportion of duplicate genes  were partially redundant, suggesting the occurrence of subfunctionalization during evolutionary process. in other words, a fraction of nac genes in populus are likewise to have been retained by substantial subfunctionalization. furthermore, we identified a subset of populus nac genes with putative functional roles in wood-forming and secondary cell wall biosynthesis, and results presented here will be helpful for future functional studies to unravel their divergent roles.
