BACKGROUND
pheromones are chemical substances that are secreted externally by an individual and received by other individuals of the same species, in which they induce a specific behavior and/or neuroendocrine responses in receiving individuals  <cit> . in mammals, pheromones are mainly detected by the vomeronasal organ   <cit> . the vomeronasal receptor type  <dig>   <cit>  and v2r  <cit>  families are specifically expressed in sensory neurons of the rodent vno. both receptor types belong to the seven-transmembrane domain g protein-coupled receptor family, but they share no sequence similarity. thus, these receptor types are generally considered to have evolved independently. the deletion of  <dig> mouse v1r genes results in altered social behavior and loss of vomeronasal neuron responsiveness to specific pheromones  <cit> , and v1r  specifically responds to the mouse pheromone, 2-heptanone  <cit> . collectively, these results indicate that v1r functions as a pheromone receptor. mouse v2r-expressing vomeronasal neurons specifically recognize exocrine gland-secreting peptide  <dig>  <cit> . they also respond to certain pheromone candidates, such as major histocompatibility complex ligand peptide  <cit>  and mouse urinary protein  <cit> . these results suggest that v2r also functions as a pheromone receptor.

putative functional v2r genes are present in mouse, rat, opossum  <cit>  and platypus  <cit> , but no functional v2r genes have been reported in dog, cow or human  <cit> . in contrast, intact v1r genes have been identified in a variety of mammals, including mouse, rat, opossum, dog, cow and human  <cit> . however, the v1r gene repertoire varies dramatically among different mammals  <cit> . the large and diverse v1r repertoire and species-specific delineation of certain v1r subfamilies, particularly in mice and rats  <cit> , suggests that v1rs contribute to species-specific recognition of pheromones and thus have played certain roles in rodent speciation. however, the intact v1r repertoire is much smaller in non-rodent mammals, such as cow and dog  <cit> , and the roles of v1rs in these animals are not well understood.

in general, pheromones have been thought to have species-specific functions  <cit> . however, in ruminants such as goats and sheep, a goat male pheromone, which induces out-of-season ovulation in anestrous females , also affects sheep, and vice versa  <cit> , indicating that this pheromone functions across species. exposure of female sheep to the male effect pheromone stimulates c-fos expression in both the accessory olfactory bulb and main olfactory bulb  <cit> , raising the possibility that this pheromone can be detected by both the vno and the main olfactory epithelium . one goat v1r gene  is expressed in both the vno and the moe, and functional v2rs have not been detected in goat  <cit> . thus, goat v1r is a good candidate for detecting this male effect pheromone. our current study shows that the v1r gene repertoire is quite conserved among goat, sheep and cow, and thus, all of the orthologous cow-goat-sheep v1rs are predicted to detect the same or closely related chemical compound. furthermore, all identified goat v1r genes were expressed both in the vno and the moe, suggesting that v1r-mediated chemical information is transmitted by the main and accessory olfactory pathways.

RESULTS
isolation of the goat and sheep v1r genes
based on sequence similarity with  <dig> previously reported cow v1r genes  <cit> , we identified  <dig> goat and  <dig> sheep v1r genes. initially, we isolated these v1r genes using degenerate primers, which were designed based on conserved sequences present in each v1r subfamily among the various vertebrate species. unexpectedly, all the sequences we obtained had high sequence similarity with the corresponding cow v1r genes. to obtain the complete coding sequences of the v1r genes, we searched the cow genome database  for flanking nucleotide sequences adjacent to the coding sequences of each of the cow v1r genes. we then designed primers  and isolated the complete sequences of intact goat and sheep v1r genes from the respective genomic dnas by pcr. we obtained a total of  <dig> intact goat v1r genes, including one that we previously isolated   <cit> . deduced amino acid sequences of the newly isolated v1rs are listed in additional file 2: deduced amino acid sequences of newly isolated goat and sheep v1rs.

conserved repertoire of orthologous v1r genes in cow, goat and sheep
a neighbor-joining tree of intact v1r genes derived from goat, sheep and other mammalian species  <cit>  indicates that goat and sheep v1rs cluster in the a/b/o, d-f, j/k and l/m/n subfamilies, which fall within previously described cow v1r subfamilies   <cit> . figure  <dig> shows a neighbor-joining tree for cow, goat and sheep v1rs. the cow taste type  <dig> receptors   <cit>  were used as the outgroup in this tree. all of the goat and sheep v1rs have orthologs in cross-species ruminant counterparts. there were  <dig> sets of cow-goat-sheep, four pairs of cow-goat, one pair of cow-sheep, and one pair of goat-sheep orthologous v1rs. thus,  <dig> %  or  <dig> %  of the  <dig> cow v1r genes have orthologs in goat or sheep, respectively . these percentages are remarkably high compared with those corresponding to mouse and rat orthologs; only  <dig> mouse-rat orthologous v1r pairs were found among  <dig> mouse and  <dig> rat v1r genes, representing  <dig> % of mouse  and  <dig> % of rat  v1r genes, respectively . thus, orthologous v1r genes exist at significantly higher rates in cow than in mouse and rat.

the complete goat and sheep genomic sequences are not available at present. thus, we tried to estimate the approximate size of the goat and sheep v1r gene repertoire by genomic southern blot analysis under conditions of low stringency. genomic dnas were digested with the restriction enzymes that do not cut inside the v1r genes, and the resulting fragments were size fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to the membranes, and hybridized with the probes. as probes, we selected one to three goat v1r genes from each subfamily, which should detect majority of the genes belonging to each subfamily under conditions of low stringency. . we assume that the number of the generated bands corresponds to that of goat and sheep v1r genes in each subfamily. in the v1r genes subfamilies a/b/o, d, e/f, j/k, and l/m/n, we detected  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bands for goat, and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for sheep, respectively . we detected a somewhat larger number of v1r genes in goat and sheep compared with cow   <cit> , possibly a consequence of cross-hybridization of the probes with pseudogenes in the goat and sheep genomes. hence, the approximate size of the repertoire of the intact v1r genes in goat and sheep might be similar to that in cow. these data suggest that the orthologous v1r genes exist at significantly higher rates in goat and sheep than in mouse and rat, although we cannot rule out the possibility that unidentified v1r gene families exist in goat and sheep genomes.

next, we analyzed the identity of v1r orthologous pairs among goat, sheep and cow. we chose the  <dig> cow-goat,  <dig> cow-sheep, and  <dig> goat-sheep orthologous v1r pairs that clustered in monophyletic branches . we calculated and compared amino acid sequence identities for these pairs with those of the  <dig> mouse-rat orthologous v1r pairs . the identity in each set of orthologous pairs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % for cow-goat,  <dig>  to  <dig> % for cow-sheep, and  <dig>  to  <dig> % for goat-sheep, whereas the corresponding identity ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % for mouse-rat orthologous v1r pairs. the average sequence identity was  <dig> % for cow-goat,  <dig> % for cow-sheep, and  <dig> % for goat-sheep orthologous v1r pairs, and these values are substantially higher than the  <dig> % for the mouse-rat pairs. these observations suggest that, among ruminants, the orthologous v1r pairs are quite similar each other at the sequence level.

expression of v1r genes in the goat vno and moe
one goat v1r  is expressed in both the vno and the moe  <cit> . we extracted rnas from the vno and the moe to analyze the expression of the newly isolated v1r genes by nested reverse transcription-pcr . we found that all v1r genes were expressed in the vno and the moe . although zone-specific expression of olfactory receptors has been reported in rodents  <cit> , such a v1r expression pattern was not observed in goat moe . to obtain a more precise understanding of v1r gene expression, we performed in situ hybridization analysis and found that all v1rs, except v1r <dig>  are expressed in small subsets of the cells in the neuroepithelial layer of the moe as well as in that of the vno   <cit> . because v1r <dig> was initially detected by rt-pcr analysis, failure to detect v1r19-expressing cells in the moe might reflect the relatively small number of these cells. collectively, our results suggest that all goat v1r genes identified thus far are expressed in both olfactory organs, the vno and moe.

discussion
we identified and analyzed goat and sheep v1r genes  by comparison with  <dig> cow v1r genes in the cow genome database  <cit> . all the v1r genes we identified have orthologs in these cross-species ruminant counterparts . in cow, over 70%  of v1rs have orthologs in goat and/or sheep . this is a surprisingly high percentage because in rodent only  <dig> % of the mouse  and  <dig> % of the rat  v1r genes have an ortholog in their cross-species counterpart. so, species-specific v1rs, which represent 85-90% of mouse and rat v1rs, are almost nonexistent in cow, and "conserved" v1rs, which have orthologs among these ruminant species, have been retained . thus, cow v1rs are distinct from the species-specific v1rs of rodents  <cit> . we speculate that the role of v1rs in defining species specificity has degenerated in ruminants. alternatively, the function of defining species specificity may have developed in rodent v1rs after the ancestral separation of ruminants from rodents.

the amino acid sequence identity of cow-goat, cow-sheep and particularly goat-sheep orthologous v1r pairs  was remarkably high, strongly suggesting that, within each set/pair, these orthologous v1rs detect the same or closely related chemical compound. we speculate that ruminant v1rs might function to detect compounds that are evolutionarily conserved and/or commonly essential for the survival of these species. therefore, the main function of ruminant v1r might differ from that of rodent v1r.

expression of v1r genes in the moe has been reported in lower vertebrates, such as fish  <cit>  and frog  <cit> . however, such expression has been regarded as the exception in mammals, although v1r expression in the moe has been reported in human  <cit>  and goat  <cit> . expression of all  <dig> goat v1r genes in both the vno and the moe  suggests that these v1rs play a role in chemoreception in the moe and that v1r-mediated chemical signals are likely transmitted by two morphologically distinct pathways. similar parallel processing of certain pheromone and pheromone candidates in the main and accessory olfactory systems has been reported in rodents  <cit> . however, it is unlikely that rodent v1rs are the receptor for these compounds in the moe, because functional expression of v1rs has not been reported in rodent moe  <cit> . therefore, analysis of v1r-mediated parallel processing systems in ruminants should provide a profound understanding of the diverse systems of mammalian chemoreception.

these features of v1r orthologs in goat and sheep, and the expression of the v1rs in the moe , raise the possibility that v1r is involved in detecting the male effect pheromone. the male effect pheromone affects both goat and sheep  <cit>  and seems to be detected by the moe  <cit> . studies have suggested that volatile chemicals are the candidates for the male effect pheromone  <cit> . furthermore, the v2r-mediated signal transduction pathway, which is believed to play a role for pheromone reception in rodents, does not seem to be involved in the goat pheromone reception system  <cit> . taken together, these data suggest that v1r is a very good candidate receptor for the male effect pheromone.

the expression of v1rs in both olfactory organs, the moe and vno, may indicate the dual system for perceiving the pheromone information in goat; it appears likely that the presence of the male effect pheromone is first detected by moe v1r, which induces the flehmen response to actively intake pheromone molecules into the vno for more precise quantitative analysis with the v1r in it, and if the amount of pheromone is assessed to exceed a certain threshold level, the information is then conveyed into deeper part of the brain, resulting in eventual stimulation of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse generator activity in the hypothalamus. although studies have reported that the pulsatile secretory pattern of luteinizing hormone is accelerated without functional vno under certain experimental conditions  <cit> , this result does not preclude the potential importance of the vno in mediating the pheromone effect under the natural social circumstances, where the levels of airborne pheromones are so subtle that a well-coordinated dual olfactory system needs to play a vital role in detecting as well as perceiving them. at present, we cannot rule out the possibility that other receptor families, such as the olfactory receptor, might also be involved in recognizing the male effect pheromone in the moe. thus, functional identification of the receptor for the male effect pheromone requires further study.

CONCLUSIONS
the repertoire of v1r orthologs is substantially more conserved among three ruminant species than between rodent species, raising the possibility that each orthologous ruminant set/pair detects the same or closely related chemical compounds. these results may explain the "inter-species" pheromonal effect between goat and sheep. in goat, all v1rs identified thus far are expressed in both the vno and the moe, suggesting that in the moe these v1rs play a role in chemoreception and that v1r-mediated chemical signals are likely transmitted by two morphologically distinct pathways. these features of ruminant v1rs seem to be distinct from those of rodent v1rs, suggesting that the ruminant v1rs may have evolved different functions than rodent v1rs.
