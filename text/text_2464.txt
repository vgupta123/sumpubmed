BACKGROUND
whole genome sequences can be conveniently and rapidly sequenced by next-generation sequencing  platforms, especially genomes of microorganisms, whose sizes usually range from two to six mega base pairs. one of the largest biological information centers, the national center for biotechnology information , has collected more than two thousand bacterial genomes in its microbial genomes resources, and the number of microbial whole genomes submitted to ncbi is growing exponentially. these precious whole genome data may provide us with an opportunity to study genomes at a comprehensive level.

as complete genome sequences become available, genome organization studies become attractive due to their applications to gene function predictions and phylogenetic relationship studies  <cit> . gene order and gene content determined by ortholog identification have been well investigated in genome organization studies. a number of previous studies have indicated that conserved gene orders may correlate with functional protein interactions  <cit> . as phylogenetic signals, gene order and gene content variation also play an important role in speciation and gene functional divergence. whole genome feature-based phylogenetic methods are urgently needed as more complete genome sequences become available. in contrast to phylogenetic studies based on a single or a few genes, studies over entire genomes involve more evolutionary variations and may reveal more confident phylogenetic relationships. some genome feature-based methods have emerged, such as using gene content, gene order and the distribution of oligonucleotides , in phylogenetic analyses. interestingly, a dna string approach called the cvtree method  <cit>  claims to be alignment-free and may have great potential in metagenomics studies. additionally, methods based on whole genome single nucleotide polymorphisms  are increasingly being used in phylogenetic analysis  <cit> .

inspired by gene content-based and gene order-based studies in genomics, as well as network-based studies in informatics, we built a genome network called the genome topology network  to study genomic structural variations  among closely related genomes. the gtn is constructed with information on gene homology relationships and gene locations, and it is less prone to homoplasy by convergence or reversal in phylogenetic studies. we also propose the concept of ‘unfixed ortholog’, whose members are affected by svs in genome topology among close species. however, the gene annotations acquired from public databases may be inconsistent due to annotating different tools and/or parameters, making comparative studies difficult and inaccurate. to make annotations from public databases comparable and improve the 'unfixed ortholog' recognition precision, a strategy was applied to detect annotation differences between closely related genomes and to annotate remaining genes. in addition, an algorithm is provided to summarize evolutionary events between close branches in phylogenetic trees, which may provide new insights into genomic structure studies. for example, this algorithm may be used to identify strains with faster duplication or deletion rates. the gtn method has been implemented in perl and released on our website. the current tool is tentative and relies on third-party tree-generating software. it is currently restricted to the analysis of complete genomes and will be improved to be applicable for draft genomes and support bootstrap tests in the future. to demonstrate the use of the gtn method, thirteen complete genomes of mycobacterium tuberculosis were studied, observing useful and interesting results.

methods
m. tuberculosis genome sequences, annotation refinement and orthology assignment
the genomes of thirteen m. tuberculosis strains were downloaded from ncbi , and the plasmid sequences were eliminated. the annotation refinement was carried out through coding sequence  mapping by blast   <cit> ; thus, the cdss collected from the thirteen strains were used to map each genome. a new annotated gene was retrieved from external cds that mapped 100% to an intergenic region or to a region with a less-than-80% overlap with known genes, such that pseudogenes were eliminated. clusters of orthologous groups    <cit>  were used as references to assign orthology, and orthomcl   <cit>  was employed to generate customized orthology clusters. protein sequences from the thirteen m. tuberculosis strains were aligned to the cog database via blast   <cit>  , and the best hits were selected as the cog annotations. the cog clusters are referred to as the finished cog categories. the orthology clusters were determined by orthomcl  <cit>  with default orthology assigning parameters.table  <dig>

construction of gtns
a gtn is described as g = <v, e > . a g contains a vertex set v and an edge set e. the vertex set is an orthologous set found in a genome and is described as v = {orthoa, orthob, orthoc, …} in a gtn. the edge set is an undirected edge set containing edges of all vertices in a gtn. the edge set is described as e = {e <dig> e <dig> e <dig> ..}, where each element  represents a pair of adjacent genes  in the genome. the vertexes are determined by orthologous clustering, and the edges are determined by the gene order. to illustrate, cog-based gtns were taken. supposing that a genome contains four genes, g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig>  rank orderly in the genome. among them, g <dig> and g <dig> do not have hits in the cog database, and g <dig> and g <dig> are annotated as coga and cogb, respectively. then, the vertex set of the genome is v = {coga,cogb}, and the edge set is e = {ecoga, cogb}. notably, a circular bacterial genome is treated as a linear structure beginning with dnaa here.figure  <dig> 
the construction of gtns and how gtns are affected by evolutionary events.  constructing a gtn from a genome. supposing that gene <dig> and gene <dig> are annotated as coga, gene <dig> as cogb and gene <dig> as cogc, the numbers adjacent to the lines in the gtns are degrees.  the variation in gtn structure when gene <dig> is duplicated and inserted between genex and geney. genex and geney are annotated as cogx and cogy, respectively.  the variation in gtn structure when gene <dig> is lost.  the variation in gtn structure when the segments of gene <dig> and gene <dig> are reversed in the genome.



the degree of an edge e is the frequency of the ortholog pairs in the gtn and is described as degree = frequency; for example, if the edge ecoga, cogb appears twice in a genome, the degree of this edge is  <dig> and is described as degree =  <dig>  if a genome has n cog-annotated genes and is clustered into m cog groups, then the vertex number of this gtn is m, and the sum of the degrees in this gtn is n- <dig> 

unfixed gene definition and enrichment analysis of an unfixed gene set
the unfixed ortholog is defined before the unfixed gene. an unfixed ortholog is determined by the different degree of the ortholog between two genomes . the formula of the different degree  is:  <dig> ddp,qorthoi=rounddown∑degreeeorthoi,orthoip−degreeeorthoi,orthoiq 

the ortho i in equation  denotes the target ortholog, and the ortho i represents all the orthologs that are adjacent to ortho i in genomes p and q. the result of formula  reflects the different constitutions of adjacent genes of ortho i on the two genomes. an ortholog group containing more genes affected by svs would acquire a higher dd. if the result of equation  is greater than  <dig>  the orthologous group is regarded as an unfixed ortholog, and the orthologous group’s genes are defined as unfixed genes .

when the genome number is n , the average dd  calculated by the following formula will be used:  <dig> ddaveorthoi=aveddp,qorthoip≠q 

in the unfixed gene enrichment analysis, the cog database was used to determine orthologous relationships. cogs are classified into twenty-one sub-categories in the cog database. the enrichment analysis was conducted by fisher’s exact test for each sub-category, and the null hypothesis was that the proportion of unfixed cog groups is higher  in one sub-category than in the other sub-categories. the sub-category whose p-value is less than  <dig>  will be considered to possess significantly more  unfixed cog groups than other sub-categories.

the calculation of the distance between gtns and phylogenetic analysis
distance is used to describe the difference between two gtns, and the distance between two gtns constructed with genome <dig> and genome <dig> is defined as follow:  <dig> dg <dig> g2=1−1n∑i=1n2×ciτ1i+τ2i 

in the formula, n is the number of total non-redundant vertexes of genome <dig> and genome <dig>  τ1i is the number of vertexes  that are adjacent to vertex i  in genome <dig>  and τ2i is the number of vertexes that are adjacent to vertex i in genome <dig>  ci is the number of common vertexes that are adjacent to vertex i  in the two genomes. in formula , a cumulative jaccard distance that is frequently used in measuring the difference between two objects is used to weigh the difference between two gtns.

the two distance matrices are calculated with orthologous relationships determined by cog and orthomcl among thirteen m. tuberculosis genomes and the m. bovis bcg genome. the m. bovis bcg used in the phylogenetic analyses is the outgroup. in total,  <dig> housekeeping genes shared among thirteen m. tuberculosis strains and m. bovis bcg  <cit>  were used in the multi-gene tree construction. all phylogenetic trees were inferred using the neighbor-joining  method with the mega  software  <cit> . in the construction of the multi-gene tree, the bootstrap method was used to test the confidence of topology.

lost gene recognition and enrichment analysis of the lost genes
the lost genes are obtained by comparison of orthologs identified by orthomcl between a strain and the reference strain h37rv. if orthologs exist in h37rv and are absent in the query strain, they are considered lost genes. the kegg  <cit>  pathway enrichment analyses were carried out on lost gene sets using the online tool david  <cit> . the enrichment analysis background is the set of genes in the reference strain h37rv.

RESULTS
annotation refinement and orthology assignment
we found that genome annotation accuracy was important for gtn construction and unfixed gene recognition. however, many genes were left unannotated in some genomes due to using different annotation tools and annotation parameters. for instance, a comparison of the annotations in two well-annotated strains, h37ra and h37rv, shows that the different content and order of cog <dig>  is a false positive. both h37ra and h37rv possess seven cog <dig> paralogs; however, only six pairs are identical between the two genomes. after mapping h37ra’s cdss to the h37rv genome, an unannotated cog <dig> orthologous gene termed mra_ <dig> was observed in h37ra at a similar location in h37rv and vice-versa for the h37rv gene rv2830c. the gene overlaps should be responsible for the annotation inconsistency . after annotation refinement, h37ra and h37rv were shown to possess eight cog <dig> paralogs.

the gene overlap among thirteen strains reveals that gene overlap commonly exists in original gene annotations . the largest overlap ratio in the original annotations, the overlap between mtctri2_ <dig> and mtctri2_ <dig> in ctri- <dig>  was near 100%. the threshold of the overlap ratio in ccdc <dig> was less than 20%, which was much lower than that of other strains. cdc <dig> possesses the most overlapped genes, nearly twofold more than the other strains. due to the importance of gene overlap in annotations, different overlap thresholds were used in the annotation refinement. however, when the threshold was set to 70% or 90%, there were few differences in the results. thus, the overlap threshold between the additionally annotated genes and the known genes was set to less than 80% in the final annotation refinement. after annotation refinement, the overlapped genes increased in every strain, and both the number of overlapped genes and the overlap ratio share similar distributions within the thirteen strains . in total,  <dig> to  <dig> new annotated genes were added to the thirteen strains . the total gene number in each strain was approximately  <dig> , with the highest being  <dig>   and the lowest ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . most of the m. tuberculosis genes  are annotated by the cog reference sequences. the majority of the genes  are clustered and assigned orthologous groups by orthomcl.figure  <dig>

unfixed cog groups
the refined genes are clustered into  <dig>  cog groups, and more than three-fourths  have dds  greater than  <dig>  indicating the prevalence of genomic svs . the enrichment analysis between unfixed cog groups and fixed cog groups  in each cog sub-category shows that the sub-category of ‘secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism’ contains significantly more unfixed cogs . the cog groups with the most dds are listed in table  <dig>  interestingly, the ppe-repeat proteins  group, which is described as encoding virulence factors and antigens, has the highest dd . the ppe-repeat proteins group containing more than sixty paralogs is highly polymorphic and is thought to be the main source of complex antigenic variation in m. tuberculosis  <cit> . as expected, four types of transposase are found with high dds. additionally, the transcriptional regulator tetr family  and three groups, fadd cog <dig>  fade cog <dig> and echa cog <dig>  which are involved in lipid β-oxidation, possess high dds.table  <dig>

phylogenetic trees
the two phylogenetic trees  constructed with cog gtns and orthomcl gtns show great similarity in topology. the phylogenetic analysis of orthomcl gtns results in a rooted phylogenetic tree grouping fourteen strains into  <dig> lineages:  bcg,  the beijing family and  the non-beijing family. the topology of the cog gtn tree is nearly identical to that of the orthomcl gtn tree . a comparison of the two gtn-based trees with the multi-gene tree constructed with  <dig> housekeeping genes  shows that the topologies are similar at the confident branches . the sv study shows that few ortholog pair variations occur within the kzn group , h <dig> group  or ccdc group  . there are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> unique ortholog pairs in the kzn group, the h <dig> group and the ccdc group, respectively, when each is compared to the other two groups. the ortholog pair variations mostly occur in the rgtb group  in m. tuberculosis, and cdc <dig> possesses  <dig>  unique ortholog pairs compared to its sister groups, rgtb <dig> and rgtb <dig> figure  <dig>

enrichment analysis of lost gene sets in three strains
the gtn tree-based ortholog pair variation analysis reveals that three strains, rgtb <dig>  rgtb <dig> and cdc <dig>  hold more pair variations than other strains. there were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes lost in rgtb <dig>  rgtb <dig> and cdc <dig>  respectively, compared to h37rv . the lost genes from rgtb <dig> show enrichment in eight pathways involved in metabolism, biosynthesis and degradation. among the enriched pathways, the abc transporters may play important roles in drug resistance  <cit> . the lost genes from rgtb <dig> were enriched in twenty pathways; among them, fatty acid metabolism is a key pathway during infection  <cit> , and the two-component system pathway is important in the immune response  <cit> . the lost genes from cdc <dig> show enrichment in three pathways, and the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway is important to endotoxin bioactivity  <cit> . rgtb <dig> and rgtb <dig> share five enriched pathways, while cdc <dig> shares no enriched pathways with rgtb <dig> and rgtb <dig> table  <dig>

discussion
in this study, a network-based method was raised to analyze the structural dynamics of genomes. to illustrate the application of this method, we analyzed thirteen complete m. tuberculosis genomes and discovered much useful information. the tool exhibits the following functions: gene annotation refinement, orthology assignment with cog, unfixed gene analysis and phylogenetic analysis. furthermore, orthologous relationships can be determined by any orthology assigning method.

the consistency of gene annotation is crucial in gtn construction, as gene content and gene order may affect the framework of gtn. during orthology assignment, we find that a number of genes have not been properly annotated in some strains. comparing annotations from h37rv and h37ra shows that annotation refinement should be applied to thirteen m. tuberculosis strain annotations. the goal of the annotation refinement was to minimize the impact of annotation inconsistency and improve the precision of 'unfixed ortholog' recognition. the phenomenon of many genes left unannotated in ccdc <dig> demonstrates that longer overlaps might be taken into account during the annotation of m. tuberculosis genomes. despite performing annotation refinement, the gene numbers of rgtb <dig> and rgtb <dig> still seem abnormal when compared to those of other strains. furthermore, the records of rgtb <dig> and rgtb <dig> in ncbi were marked as ‘removed’ recently, indicating that the authors and/or the staff may realize the imprecision of the data. the minor differences in the results after annotation refinement under varied overlap thresholds show that the refining method is robust in terms of overlaps between additional and known annotations.

whole genome alignment-based methods can provide a visual view of svs among multiple genomes. however, the excessive attention paid to the alignment may hamper the exploration of biological issues via sequence-oriented methods. our network-based method is function-oriented and easy to use. it has shown potential for exposing drug resistance and pathogenesis-related genes affected by svs. in the study of thirteen m. tuberculosis strains, enrichment analysis of unfixed cog groups show that the ‘translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis’ category contains fewer unfixed cogs, which may indicate the conservation of its members. more cog groups in ‘secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism’ possess high dds, which may indicate that these members are active in the thirteen m. tuberculosis strains.

the unfixed gene analysis of the thirteen strains resulted in  <dig> top cog groups with high dds. the transposases  and the ppe-repeat proteins  shown to be highly polymorphic in previous studies have high dds in our study. some cog groups with high dds are related to energy and lipid metabolism, such as fadd , fade  and echa . in m. tuberculosis, fatty acids degradation is the main energy source during infection, and lipid metabolism plays an important role in invading host cells  <cit> . fade is up-regulated when exposed to inh  <cit> , and the expression of echa increases when the bacteria are exposed to macrophages  <cit> . it is interesting that the fadd gene becomes up-regulated when treated with sds  <cit> . some cog groups are related to secondary metabolism, such as ‘polyketide synthase modules and related proteins’  and ‘o-methyltransferase involved in polyketide biosynthesis’ . the pks and pps genes are grouped in cog <dig>  and the deletion of pks <dig> has shown a drug resistance incensement in mycobacterium avium  <cit> . zheng, et al. also showed that mutations in pks <dig> may be responsible for the loss of virulence in h37ra  <cit> . furthermore, we found that the gene pks <dig> from h37ra encoding  <dig>  amino acids aligned to two genes, pks <dig> and pks <dig>  encoding  <dig> and  <dig>  amino acids, respectively, from h37rv. h37rv contains a stop codon at base pair  <dig> , <dig>  between pks <dig> and pks <dig>  some cog groups involved in gene regulation have high dds, such as members of the tetr family . the tetr family proteins are involved in the transcriptional control of multidrug efflux pumps, the biosynthesis of antibiotics, responses to osmotic stress and toxic chemicals, differentiation and pathogenicity  <cit> . the sv of transcriptional regulators may result in changes in the expression of target genes. for example, the expression of acref in escherichia coli increases after a gene is inserted upstream  <cit> . m. tuberculosis contains three members of the tetr family. one of the members  controls the expression of mmr, which functions as a multidrug efflux pump  <cit> . some cog groups relating to signal transduction possess high dds, such as ‘adenylate cyclase’ . interestingly, the relative dd of adenylate cyclase is equal to that of ppe repeat-proteins and is higher than those of most other groups. adenylate cyclase has been shown to facilitate the delivery of bacterial-derived cyclic amp  into the macrophage cytoplasm and lead to camp intoxication in macrophages  <cit> . there are many drug-related cog groups possessing high dds, such as ‘cytochrome p450’ , ‘coenzyme f420-dependent n <dig>  n10-methylene tetrahydromethanopterin reductase and related flavin-dependent oxidoreductases’  and ‘predicted drug exporters of the rnd superfamily’ . previous comparative genomic analysis of h37ra and h37rv has shown that a member of cog <dig> named mmpl <dig> is unique to h37rv, and mmpl <dig> is predicted to be a transmembrane transport protein. furthermore, is elements have been detected flanking mmpl <dig>  <cit> . in m. tuberculosis, cytochrome p <dig> enzymes are potential candidates for drug targeting  <cit> , and the possession of high dd may be due to the wide use of anti-tuberculosis drugs.

the increasing number of publicly accessible genome sequences makes it possible to reconstruct phylogenetic trees based on whole genome features. previous studies have suggested little diversity in m. tuberculosis genomes  <cit> ; however, evolutionary events were detected in our study, supporting the use of a gtn-based tree to elucidate whole genome topology changes and implying potential application on a general species level. the method will be applied to other bacteria and eukaryotes in the future. in the phylogenetic analysis, ortholog pair variations were used as phylogenetic signals to reveal evolutionary histories. ortholog pair variations may not directly reflect evolutionary events, but they are correlated.

the cog-gtn and orthomcl-gtn trees, which include more than 61% and 88% of m. tuberculosis genes, respectively, are nearly similar, with the exception of ut <dig>  suggesting the robustness of the gtn approach for gene numbers and its potential usage in other scenarios. however, the current method is tentative and relies on third-party tree-generating software. we will improve the method to support bootstrap tests in the future. some parts of the multi-gene based tree are low confidence, suggesting more sequences are needed to provide sufficient phylogenetic signals. previous studies have shown that whole genome snp-based approaches are a reliable method by which to infer phylogenies in m. tuberculosis, and six lineages have been classified in the m. tuberculosis complex  <cit> . in this study, two strains of the beijing family, ccdc <dig> and ccdc <dig>  belonging to lineage  <dig>  eleven strains of non-beijing family, belonging to lineage  <dig>  and the bcg were used. two strains, h37rv and bcg, are shared with the previously published snp-based tree. the gtn tree topology agrees with the hypothesis that the geographic origin is a remarkable factor affecting m. tuberculosis strain genome structures  <cit> . for example, the f <dig> branch, isolated from western cape , is closely related to the cluster of three strains isolated from kwazulu-natal . the tree also shows that h37ra is a sister group of h37rv, which agrees with the evolutionary histories of h37rv and h37ra. according to variation events, the strains cdc <dig>  rgtb <dig> and rgtb <dig>  belonging to the non-beijing family, possess notable differences in gene content, suggesting that they have undergone  a period with a fast deletion rate, if the data of the two rgtbs were reliable.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a network-based method, gtn, to investigate structural dynamics of bacterial genomes. the method was implemented in perl and released on our website. the tool makes identification of genes affected by svs and phylogenetic analysis easy. to assess the gtn method, thirteen complete genomes of m. tuberculosis were studied, and useful and interesting results were obtained. some immunogenic-related and drug resistance-related genes were showed to be affected by svs in m. tuberculosis; for instance the ppe repeat genes and the pks genes are affected in this way. the phylogenetic analyses of m. tuberculosis and m. bovis bcg were based on the gtn result of two rooted trees, which were compatible with the published snp phylogenetic tree. our network-based method is function-oriented and easy to use. it has shown potential for exposing drug resistance and pathogenesis-related genes in m. tuberculosis. the gtn method is expected to be further used in other species.
