BACKGROUND
zinc is an essential trace element for all organisms, and is involved in a variety of biological functions  <cit> . it has been recognised as a cofactor for more than  <dig> catalytic enzymes, and is required for structural and functional integrity of more than  <dig> transcription factors involved in the expression of various genes  <cit> . therefore, almost every signalling and metabolic pathway is in some way dependent on at least one, and often several, zinc-requiring proteins. in humans zinc deficiency has become a world-wide problem and causes a variety of symptoms including retarded growth, diarrhoea, anorexia, impaired immunity, skin lesions, and abnormal development  <cit> . zinc has also been implicated in many diseases including immune system defects  <cit> , neurodegeneration  <cit> , diabetes  <cit> , and cancer  <cit> . therefore, elucidation of the molecular targets of zinc becomes exceedingly important.

intracellular accumulation of zinc is the outcome of influx and efflux processes via zinc transporter proteins. these are mainly from the slc <dig>  transporter family, which transports zinc into the cytosol, and the slc <dig>  transporter family, responsible for the flux of zinc away from the cytosol, either into organelles or out of the cell  <cit> . in addition, metallothioneins  have high binding affinity for zinc and play a very important role in maintaining stable intracellular zinc availability through the binding or releasing zinc  <cit> . levels of mt proteins depend on zinc availability and are, at least partially, regulated at the mrna level. a well-known mechanism is through the metal-responsive transcription factor  <dig> , a recognised zinc-sensory transcriptional activator. upon binding to zinc mtf <dig> is able to bind metal-response elements , and further induces transcription of key target genes such as metallothioneins  and zinc transporter- <dig> slc30a <dig>   <cit> . mtf <dig> may also function as a transcriptional repressor as exemplified by its down-regulation of zip <dig>  <cit> . mtf1-regulated genes also include several genes not related to zinc in an obvious way  <cit> .

changes in mrna expression patterns due to zinc deficiency in some mammalian cells and tissues, such as intestine, liver, hepatocytes and leukocytes, have been investigated using microarray technology  <cit> . some genes identified in these studies are involved in growth and energy metabolism, hepatic lipid metabolism, and signal transduction pathways that control immune responses. these data have provided a starting point to investigate molecular mechanisms mediating zinc deficiency-derived metabolic disturbances. however, although distinct sets of genes appear to be regulated by zinc deficiency, the response seems to vary from tissue to tissue, between cell types, and treatment conditions. we argue that zinc regulation is not only tissue-specific but also time-dependent, such that groups of genes with distinct functionalities may be regulated at different time-points following a change in zinc availability. in addition, as zinc is mainly obtained from diet in mammals it takes time to reach a state of zinc deficiency. it can also be difficult to distinguish the effect of zinc deficiency from other disturbances associated with poor nutrition.

in addition to absorbing zinc from the diet, fish take up zinc across the gills directly from the water. it is evident from previous studies that zinc regulation in the fish gill is indeed highly dynamic and efficient  <cit>  and that zinc transporters in fish play similar functions as in mammals  <cit> . with the genomic resources available for zebrafish this is an experimental organism of choice for molecular studies on zinc. the aims of this study were to further elucidate the effects of zinc deficiency and underlying regulation mechanisms, particularly the temporal components of gene expression. our approach therefore employs a comprehensive microarray  to explore the time course of transcription profiles in the zebrafish gill. zebrafish were maintained under both normal and zinc depleted conditions, and transcriptomic analysis phenotypically anchored by physiological measurements of whole body nutrient composition, zinc status and uptake. transcriptional profiles from gill samples collected at five time points were obtained and analysed in quintuplicate. expression of a total of  <dig> transcripts showed differential regulation by zinc deficiency. these were enriched with genes involved in biological processes such as development, cell cycle, cell differentiation, gene regulation, butanoate metabolism, lysine degradation, protein dephosphorylation, nucleobase, nucleoside and nucleotide metabolism, and cellular metabolic processes. dna-binding proteins was one of the largest molecular function groups among regulated genes, and bioinformatic analysis of the temporal gene expression profile indicated that transcription factors foxl <dig>  wt <dig>  nr5a <dig>  nr6a <dig>  and especially, hnf4a may be key coordinators of the homeostatic response to zinc depletion.

RESULTS
physiological characterisation of zinc treatment
to elucidate the underlying molecular effects of zinc deficiency we conducted a time-course experiment on zebrafish subjected for  <dig> days to either zinc-depleted water and low zinc diet, or zinc-adequate water and diet as a control. the efficacy of the zinc depleted conditions in producing zinc deficiency was demonstrated by a 25% reduction in body zinc content  . it was recently shown that the same treatment also resulted in persistently decreased levels of zinc in gills  <cit> . the body copper content was also significantly reduced, while the body iron content showed a non-significant tendency to increase . this indicates the occurrence of interplay between regulation of zinc and other metals. there was no significant change observed in body weight, lipid and protein content between the two groups at the end of two-week experiment .

the fish gill is a major pathway for zinc acquisition directly from water. to test the effect of zinc depletion on the zinc up-take capacity across the gill, unidirectional zinc influx was measured at an external zinc concentration of  <dig> μm zn2+ for eight fish from each group at each time point. fish on the zinc-deficiency treatment showed a 30-40% lower zinc uptake compared to the normal controls at all time points except day  <dig> .

validation of microarray method by quantitative pcr
the qpcr of mrna abundance for  <dig> genes, using nine biological replicates  per group per time point including the five gill samples used for microarrays, verified the accuracy and validity of our array results. considering the large number of samples , validation was only applied to several genes regulated on days  <dig> and  <dig>  except mt <dig>  and slc30a <dig>  which were extended to cover all time points. the data were combined with those from genes selected in a parallel study  <cit>  and shown in table  <dig>  the measurements from qpcr analysis were in agreement, at least in direction, with the microarray results. it was, therefore, concluded that quantification of transcripts by microarrays provided a good representation of the relative expression of the genes in zebrafish gills.

general effect of zinc depletion on differential gene expression in gills
five fish were withdrawn from either the zinc depleted or adequate conditions at each of five time points:  <dig> hours,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days. gills were dissected and rna extracted from each pair of gills. a total of  <dig>  gene targets on the zebrafish arrays were evaluated for a total of  <dig> rna samples .

a total of  <dig>  probe sets showed significant hybridisation signals , which covered approximately  <dig>  genes with unigene ids. genes that showed a fold-change greater than  <dig>  and an adjusted p-value less than  <dig> , controlling for a 10% false discovery rate  with the benjamini-hochberg method, were regarded as differentially regulated by zinc depletion compared to the control group. we found that a total of  <dig> reporters,  <dig> % of all significant signals in gill, were significantly regulated at one or more time points. of these,  <dig> transcripts corresponding to  <dig> unigene ids were analysed further . treating each time point as a separate event  <dig> % of all significant changes in gene expression represented up-regulation and  <dig> % down-regulation.

a temporal profile of the overall numbers of up- or down-regulated transcripts showed that changes in gene expression occurred as early as  <dig> hours following introduction of the zinc depleted condition, reached the peak level at day  <dig>  and then subsided by day  <dig> . at the first two sampling points,  <dig> and  <dig> hours, the numbers of genes that were up- or down-regulated were similar. down-regulation dominated for the remainder of the 14-day period with the number of genes down-regulated compared to the control being three times higher than those up-regulated. these results suggest that zinc deficiency has a negative influence on the overall gene expression level in gill and that a new steady-state in zinc homeostasis is established within  <dig> days. there was little continuity in regulation of individual genes, in fact, mt <dig> was the only gene consistently and significantly regulated in a single direction  throughout the experiment. many other genes were significantly up-regulated relative to the control at one time point and down-regulated at another.

functional classification of the regulated genes
the functional enrichment analysis was performed using the functional annotation tools of david  to determine if zinc deficiency resulted in regulation of genes of any particular type or function. the zebrafish genome is still relatively sparsely represented in the david database so that when a combined list of all  <dig> regulated genes with unique unigene ids was submitted only  <dig> were returned with annotations. categories that were overrepresented among these  <dig> genes included protein dephosphorylation and embryonic development . another group of interesting genes  consisted of three major histocompatibility complex genes, zgc: <dig> , mhc1ufa and mhc1uda. these genes were significantly regulated on days  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting that antigen presentation might be affected by zinc deficiency.

acategories enriched in the data-set at p <  <dig>  and containing three or more genes are listed.

to investigate functional systems and pathways regulated by zinc deficiency in more details we took advantage of the similarities between human and zebrafish genes and used the zebrafish unigene clusters associated with our reporters to retrieve the corresponding human orthologs. of the  <dig> regulated genes with unique unigene ids  <dig> human orthologs were matched  and submitted to david. a total of  <dig> entries were returned with annotations. genes regulated at each time point were also classified and analysed in the same manner.

'developmental process' was the most significantly overrepresented biological process go term , involving 27% of all regulated genes . the 'gene expression' cluster grouped genes annotated for 'nucleus'  and 'regulation of biological processes' . although not shown in figure  <dig>  these included  <dig> genes involved in 'transcription regulation', a swiss-prot keyword that was itself overrepresented . the 'butanoate metabolism and lysine degradation' cluster comprised five genes which mapped onto the kegg pathway for butanoate metabolism, four of which also appear in the kegg pathway for lysine degradation. four annotations from separate databases  relating to 'protein-tyrosine phosphatases' appeared at a disproportionately higher frequency among regulated genes than expected to occur by chance . four hierarchically linked go terms relating to 'nucleobase, nucleoside and nucleotide metabolic process' were overrepresented among the regulated genes. a significantly disproportionate 75% of the regulated genes were labelled with the go term 'cellular process' and related children terms. among the listed top  <dig> most significant categories there were also four annotation terms that did not appear to be directly related to each other or any of the aforementioned clusters. these included terms such as 'regulation of neurotransmitter levels'  and 'cellular lipid metabolic process' .

analysis across time points revealed that distinct functional groups were regulated at different stages of the progression of zinc deficiency . significant overrepresentation of annotation terms  within gene lists from specific sampling times was only observed for days  <dig> and  <dig>  for day  <dig>   and  <dig> this may be linked to the low power of the analysis because of the small numbers of genes. however, the paucity of enriched annotations in the gene list from day  <dig> is intriguing since this time-point held the second highest number of regulated genes . terms relating to protein-tyrosine phosphatases and to metabolic processes were overrepresented only at day  <dig> . the former group consisted of six class i cysteine-based protein-tyrosine phosphatases , two of which were dual-specificity phosphatases  and two of which belong to the myotubularian subgroup . genes involved in butanoate metabolism and lysine degradation were regulated on day  <dig> or  <dig> and all five genes showed decreased expression in response to zinc deprivation. regulation of developmental genes was prominent on both days  <dig> and  <dig> , but those involved in neuronal differentiation were only overrepresented on day  <dig> . the genes within the category 'regulation of neurotransmitter levels' were interesting because they tended to be down-regulated during the first  <dig> h of the experiment, followed by a later increase in expression . some functional categories, such as 'cardiomyopathy', 'cellular lipid metabolic process' and 'cytoskeletal protein binding', were not overrepresented at any of the time-points but statistically enriched in the combined list of all regulated genes .

nuclear proteins, such as transcription factors, were substantially overrepresented . the zebrafish and human 'orthologue' identities of genes classified as "transcription factors" are shown in table  <dig>  and temporal expression profiles of those annotated with the term 'nucleus' illustrated in figure 4c. their general temporal profile was similar to that observed globally for all genes, with similar percentages of up- and down-regulated genes at the  <dig> hours,  <dig>  and  <dig> day time points, and the majority being down-regulated on days  <dig> and  <dig>  there was also no particular bias for transcription factors with zinc motifs to be down-regulated. like other genes most of the regulated zinc-finger and ring-finger genes were down-regulated, but the genes for the zinc-finger proteins hnf4a, znf <dig>  and esrra  were induced by zinc deficiency . in this context hnf4a became particularly interesting because increased expression of this gene was already observed  <dig> hours into the experiment but at no time-point thereafter. this quick and transient regulation indicates that hnf4a may be of importance for the early response to zinc-deprivation. the other transcription factors whose expression were up-regulated during the first  <dig> hours of zinc-deprivation included pou2f1b, foxl <dig>  and irx <dig>  of these only foxl <dig> remained induced after  <dig> hours, along with fli <dig> and znf <dig> . on days  <dig> and  <dig> there were no transcription factors up-regulated, but on day  <dig> expression of cbx3a, nkx <dig> a and esrra were increased relative to the control.

athe closest human homologue with sequence similarity higher than 45% are listed.

analysis of transcription factor binding sites  in the 5' region of regulated genes
to investigate the cascade effects that might result from changes in expression of the tfs listed in table  <dig> we extracted the upstream dna sequence of the regulated genes and searched for the occurrences of their binding site  as defined by the transfac database  <cit>  of the tfbs for the transcriptionally regulated tfs mapped to entries in the transfac  database  only genes with tfbss for foxl <dig> and hnf4a were significantly overrepresented among regulated genes relative to the non-regulated control genes . interestingly, both foxl <dig> and hnf4a were already differently regulated at  <dig> hours after the start of zinc restriction and were among the few tfs up-regulated . over 11% of the genes regulated at  <dig> hours had at least one tfbs to hnf4a within  <dig> bp upstream of the translation start site, compared with only  <dig> % of the control genes. curiously, the effect of zinc deficiency on the frequency of upstream foxl <dig> binding sites appeared to be opposite; from 24h and onwards the frequency of tfbs to foxl <dig> was significantly reduced. although mtf <dig> mrna expression did not change under zinc deficiency in this experiment mtf <dig> is a well-recognised regulator of cellular zinc homeostasis  <cit> . hence binding motifs for mtf <dig>  were also included in the analysis. the frequency of mres among regulated genes generally increased during the time of zinc deficiency treatment, but was only statistically higher than that in non-regulated genes on day  <dig>  among the genes that showed decreased mrna levels were mt <dig> and znt <dig>  both known to be regulated by mtf <dig>  <cit> .

protein interaction analysis reveals an important pathway in response to zinc depletion
the molecular interactions between zinc and proteins encoded by regulated transcripts were explored and visualised using the pathwayarchitect® software. a continuous 'direct interaction network' was generated consisting of  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges . an interactive version of the network is presented where nodes and edges can be individually explored . by far the highest numbers of interactions were found for connections with zinc and for connections with hnf4a, hepatonuclear factor  <dig> alpha. hnf4a was positioned as a hub interacting with  <dig> nodes including slc39a <dig> , slc39a <dig> , and mtf <dig> . interestingly there is experimental evidence for binding of hnf4a to promoter elements in the majority of these genes  <cit> . this analysis further implicates hnf4a in zebrafish gill as a key regulator during acclimation to a zinc deficient condition. zinc itself was a second hub in the network interacting with a number of proteins including mtf <dig>  mt, and several zinc transporters of the slc30a and slc39a families, which were found to be regulated either by microarray or qpcr .

discussion
the fish gill provides an elegant experimental system for studying mineral absorption in vivo since the concentration and speciation of metal ions on the apical side can be carefully controlled, and this organ provides the major uptake pathway for ions, including zinc  <cit> . the teleost fish gill epithelium is comprised of at least five types of cells, including respiratory pavement cells, ion transporting ionocytes , mucous cells, and neural epithelial cells  <cit> . these are mounted on a cartilage scaffold forming the gill filaments and secondary lamellae where gas and ion exchange with water takes place  <cit> . gill zinc uptake is transcellular and primarily takes place in the discrete ionocytes which transport zinc apically from the water and extrude it basolaterally to the opposite side of the epithelium  <cit> . furthermore, the gill is highly dynamic, responding to changes in the external environment to which it is in intimate contact, by remodelling its structure and cellular metabolism in order to maintain the homeostasis of essential micronutrients  <cit> . in the present study the genomic resources of the zebrafish have been exploited to investigate the molecular sequences of events invoked under zinc depleted conditions. this aims to reveal the temporal sequence of events that follow treatment with zinc depletion and provides an opportunity to identify possible global regulators through bioinformatic reverse engineering.

we have established that zinc deficiency was efficiently induced in zebrafish after a 14-day depletion of zinc in both the water and diet. this indicates that any compensatory changes invoked were insufficient to fully maintain whole body zinc concentrations, which were significantly reduced at the end of the experimental period . intriguingly the unidirectional gill zinc influx was found to be suppressed throughout the experimental period. this suppression of zinc uptake is counterintuitive since it may be expected that under conditions of reduced zinc availability proteins involved in zinc acquisition, such as zinc importers, would be up-regulated in an attempt to maintain zinc status. indeed, we have shown previously data from the same experiment demonstrating increased expression of the zinc importers, zip <dig>  zip <dig> and znt <dig>  in response to zinc depletion  <cit> . however, there was also down-regulation of the basolateral zinc exporter znt <dig>  which would limit zinc transfer into the blood stream. overall our data would suggest that zinc uptake was rate-limited by the basolateral transfer. however, further detailed physiological studies are required to confirm this interpretation.

the low zinc supply also had an effect on whole body copper status, which interestingly was reduced. the use of zinc to treat copper hyper-accumulation in wilson's disease patients provides evidence that zinc inhibits copper uptake  <cit> , an observation confirmed with our own zinc supplementation experiments  <cit> . this may seem to contradict the observation that zinc deficiency also reduced whole body copper status. one possible explanation is that the reduction in zinc stores probably reduced expression of mt, which binds copper as well as zinc. mt binds about one third of the copper in a typical fish liver, but zinc is a much better inducer of mt expression  <cit> .

the exploitation of microarray technology identified a total of  <dig> genes representing the molecular response of the gill epithelium to zinc depletion. these gene expression profiles from gill tissue provide an integrated image of zinc regulation occurring in a collection of cell types. despite zn2+ influx and whole body zinc content remaining low by the end of the 14-day experimental period, the time-course of overall gene expression indicated establishment of a new steady-state, only  <dig> genes remained regulated on day  <dig> compared with  <dig> genes on day  <dig>  the genes regulated during the acclimation to zinc depletion are involved in a variety of biological processes, reflecting the multifaceted biochemical functions of zinc. the transitory nature of the acclimation process was characterised by a succession of functional gene categories that were regulated; transcripts for protein tyrosine phosphatases, anatomical structure morphogenesis, and cellular metabolic processes being preferentially expressed early in the experiment , while enrichment of transcripts for proteins involved in nuclear functions, neuron differentiation, and cellular component assembly occurred much later . other functional categories such as 'purine ribonucleoside metabolism process', 'cardiomyopathy', and 'cellular lipid metabolic process' were significantly enriched over the entire time period but not at any particular time-point. enrichment analysis using zebrafish gene identifiers was limited by the relatively sparse representation of zebrafish genes in the david database. however, the preferential regulation of genes involved in development could be confirmed and a specific enrichment of genes involved in cell migration during development  was observed. the latter group may be of considerable interest considering recent studies implicating zinc as a regulator of the ectoderm-mesenchyme transition  during zebrafish gastrulation and human cancer  <cit> .

the majority  of the  <dig> regulated transcription factors were down-regulated under the zinc depleted condition. it is notable that among these genes there were  <dig> zinc finger proteins, and it may therefore be speculated that the effect of zinc deficiency is a feed-back response to a rather non-specific depletion of zinc from zinc finger domains. however, eight out of the  <dig> zinc finger proteins were down-regulated, which means that the percentage of down-regulated genes for zinc finger proteins  was practically the same as that for the general cohort of regulated transcription factors. nearly half  of the regulated tfs are involved in regulation of development, including foxl <dig>  neurod <dig>  fli <dig>  nr5a1a, klf <dig>  hmgb3b , epas <dig>  nkx <dig> a, irx <dig>  dlx4a, dlx5a, and notch1a. this may help explain the fact that developmental impairment is one of the key features of zinc deficiency  <cit> . furthermore, knockout of mtf <dig> is lethal to mouse embryos but not at post-embryonic stages  <cit> . it is possible that zinc signalling during development may normally modulate the expression of these tfs and their downstream targets. in terms of the significance to the fish in our experiment, it is likely that we are observing the signalling for stem-cells in the gill to differentiate and proliferate to structurally modify the gill in an attempt to regain homeostasis. the fish gill is an extremely dynamic structure shown to be reprogrammed and structurally remodelled when faced with environmental changes such as hypercapnia  <cit>  and hypothermia  <cit> . we propose that similar changes are occurring during zinc depletion.

four key regulators of development containing the homeobox sequences were identified as regulated by zinc deficiency. among these were dlx4a and dlx5a , homologous to the drosophila distal-less gene . zinc deficiency caused down-regulation of dlx4a and dlx5a  while zinc supplementation has been found to induce expression of dlx2a  another closely related gene in the same family  <cit> . all members of the dlx family may be involved in formation of cartilage and/or bone and contribute to the differentiation of mineralising cell types, including osteoblasts and chondrocytes  <cit> . this is of interest because zinc is abundant in bone and cartilage and recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of zinc transporters in the development of such tissues  <cit> . specifically, znt5-null mice develop hunched backs, show impaired growth, and decrease in bone density due to osteopenia  <cit> . foetuses of mice lacking one of the essential zinc importers, slc39a <dig> , become critically zinc deficient and show severely underdeveloped and deformed craniofacial and limb features  <cit> . knock-out for another zinc transporter of the same family, slc39a <dig> , in mice results in a phenotype with defects in bone, teeth, and connective tissue, linked to changes in the bmp signalling pathway  <cit> . this pathway involves both dlx <dig> and dlx <dig>  and targeted inactivation of dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> genes in mice results in abnormalities very similar to those observed in slc39a <dig> null mice  <cit> . the direct effect of zinc on osteogenic differentiation is strongly supported by another recent study which showed that zinc deficiency suppresses matrix mineralisation and delays osteogenic activity in mouse osteoblastic mc3t3-e <dig> cells through downregulation of runx <dig>   <cit> , while dlx <dig> has been shown to induce expression of runx <dig> and initiate osteogenic differenciation in chick calvaria osteoblasts in vitro  <cit> . together these data suggest that zinc deficiency, caused by reduced zinc uptake or disruption of zinc transporters, leads to dysregulation of mineralising cells in a process that involves suppression of dlx5/ <dig> expression and downstream effects on osteoblast differentiation.

a major objective of this study was to identify possible key master regulators responsible for orchestrating the response to zinc depletion. in the present study hnf4a  was repeatedly implicated as being of potential importance for coordination of gene expression during the early stages of acclimation to zinc restriction. first, hnf4a was one of four transcription factors up-regulated upon zinc depletion at the first sampling point  <dig> hours . second, in a 'direct interaction network' assembled by pathwayarchitect™ from all regulated genes during the experiment, hnf4a was positioned as a hub interacting with  <dig> nodes, including genes for the zinc-regulatory proteins slc30a <dig> , slc30a <dig>  and mtf <dig>  third, analysis of promoter sequences of the regulated genes revealed an overrepresentation of genes with tfbss associated with hnf4a. hnf4a does not require binding of a ligand to be activated, instead, binding to its cognate regulatory dna elements  is modified by serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation, which can be catalysed by several protein kinases  <cit> . spatial and temporal specificity of target gene transactivation is believed to be controlled by expression of cofactors interacting with hnf4a. transcription of hnf4a can be repressed by snai1a )  <cit> , which has been shown in zebrafish to respond an increase in cellular labile zn2+ concentration by nuclearisation and repression of target genes  <cit> . hence, the early increase in hnf4a expression is plausibly a result of a reduced inhibition by snail, as it is likely that the sudden depletion of zinc from the water would reduce the concentration of labile zn2+ in the gill cells. however, it was not investigated if during the first  <dig> hours of the experiment there was an increase in hnf4a protein level large enough to impact expression of hnf4a targets. because of the profound influence of zn2+ on protein phosphatase activities  <cit>  it is also possible that a change in hnf4a phosphorylation state contributed to the high representation of hnf4a regulated genes. hnf4a is known as a key regulator in the maintenance of hepatocyte differentiation and the control of lipid homeostasis  <cit> . a recent study has shown that zinc supplementation can partially attenuate alcohol-induced lipid accumulation in mice by reversing alcohol-mediated inactivation of hnf4a and ppara  <cit> . zinc deprivation inactivated the dna binding ability of hnf4a and ppara, thus regulating its target genes involved in lipid metabolism. these data not only provide further support for the key function of hnf4a in zinc deficiency found in the present study, but are also consistent with our findings of significant regulation of genes involved in 'cellular lipid metabolic process' .

one of the principal mechanisms of non-genomic zinc signalling may be through its ability to inhibit protein phosphatases at nanomolar concentrations, leading to increased phosphorylation and activity of several map and tyrosine kinases  <cit> . there is increasing evidence that this may be a common mechanism for zinc involvement in a variety of conditions including diabetes, neuronal damage during post-transfusional ischemia  <cit> , and cancer  <cit> . in the present study tyrosine-specific/dual-specificity phosphatases were overrepresented among genes regulated  <dig> hours after introduction of zinc depletion. effects of zinc depletion on phosphatase activities in gill cells would be expected to occur within minutes  <cit> . hence, the changes in abundance of mrna for phosphatases, primarily at the  <dig> hour time point, could represent a delayed transcriptional response to an earlier change in regulation of phosphatases by zinc at the protein level. such a component of zinc signalling would be of significance to understanding of the overall effects of zinc on phosphatases and consequently map kinase and tyrosine kinase activities.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the experimental design to generate transcription profiles for gills at five time points over a 14-day period allowed us to study the changes in expression of individual genes during the period of acclimation to a zinc depleted environment. a striking feature of the transcription profiles was that although there was a continuum of functional and structural categories of genes regulated during the experiment, there was little continuity in regulation of individual genes except mt <dig>  this oscillating pattern of gene regulation may reflect a homeostatic control mechanism that is gradually adjusting the gill to the new zinc depleted condition. we know from qpcr analysis that zinc importers were maximally up-regulated at day  <dig>  coinciding with maximum down-regulation of the basolateral zinc exporter znt <dig>  <cit> . network analysis of transcriptomics data indicated that effects on phosphatases and a few key transcriptional factors, such as hnf4a, coordinated early  responses and may be involved in direct regulation of slc39a <dig>  and slc39a <dig>  and other zinc effector molecules. subsequent events, which culminated on day  <dig>  appeared to entail stem cell proliferation and differentiation in attempt to regain zinc homeostasis.

it is common to see microarray studies with only a single time point represented. while such studies often provide very useful information the present study, which contained the resolution of  <dig> microarray samples spread over two conditions and five time-points, clearly demonstrates that genes may be regulated in the opposite direction at different time-points and that sets of genes regulated at different time points may have similar ontologies but largely different identities.
