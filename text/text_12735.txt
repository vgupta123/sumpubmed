BACKGROUND
the chicken was the first livestock species to have its genome completely sequenced  <cit> : a large collection of chicken single nucleotide polymorphisms  has been available for almost a decade  <cit> . more recently, the number of snps has been enlarged to over  <dig> million  <cit> . although numerous studies studying genetic variation have focused on snps, there is growing evidence for the substantial role of structural polymorphism in phenotypic diversity  <cit> . structural variation has been recognized as an important mediator of gene and genome evolution within populations  <cit> . while the sizes of genetic variants range from a single base to whole chromosomes, historically only the extreme ends of the spectrum have been explored. dna copy number variants  lie between these two extremes, ranging in size from thousands to millions of bases.

in human, many cnvs are in linkage disequilibrium with nearby genetic markers and thus appear to be ancient  <cit> . others are more recent, such as cnvs affecting olfactory receptor gene diversity  <cit> , or can be recurrent  <cit> . structural variants include a variety of molecular alterations such as duplications, deletions, and inversions  <cit> . a comprehensive map that catalogues and indexes structural variants - in particular cnvs - across the genome is a necessary prelude to understanding their role in the context of specific phenotypic traits. early reports estimated that at least 2% of the human genome is affected by structural variations  <cit> , but more recent studies suggest that as much as  <dig> % of the human genome harbors common cnvs  <cit> .

cnv regions  will be an important complement to snp-centric genome-wide association studies, since existing snp discovery and genotyping methodologies are biased against inclusion of these more complex genetic variants. furthermore, many of the cnvrs are not very well represented and annotated in the genomic sequence due to biases in chromosome assembly. in order to estimate what fraction of the genome is affected by cnv, global studies have been performed in human, chimpanzee, dog, mouse and cattle. in cattle, for example,  <dig> high confidence cnvrs were reported as covering  <dig>  mb,  <dig> of these cnvrs being apparently breed-differential or breed-specific  <cit> . to determine the full extent of variation and its influence on phenotypic variation, the reference genome assembly should be near completion and more individual genomes need to be sequenced for the species of interest. analysis of cnvs in livestock species is of particular interest, not only because of their economic importance, but also due to the often- extensive selection pressure applied in generating the different lines and varieties.

since cnvs potentially affect gene expression  <cit> , cnvs may account for a significant proportion of the extensive phenotypic variation observed in this species. examples of phenotypes associated with a cnv in the chicken include late feathering on chromosome z   <cit> , pea comb on gga <dig>  <cit> , dark brown plumage color on gga <dig>  <cit>  and dermal hyperpigmentation on gga <dig>  <cit> . additional cnvs have been detected in the chicken using acgh  <cit> , but that study only examined ten individuals and only identified  <dig> cnvs corresponding to approximately  <dig> % of the chicken genome. furthermore only  <dig> of these cnvs were observed in more than one individual.

here we applied an acgh analysis to different chicken breeds in order to obtain a global cnv map of the chicken genome.

RESULTS
cnv in chicken
acgh was carried out using the agilent 244k chicken array with a mean probe spacing of  <dig> bp. this array is based on the chicken assembly wustl  <dig>   and covers chromosomes 1– <dig>   <dig> and the sex chromosomes z and w. the virtual chromosome “chrun” with concatenated unmapped contigs was not taken into account in the probe design. to access the chicken cnv landscape, we selected  <dig> animals from  <dig> commercial lines ,  <dig> experimental lines , red jungle fowls and silkies. dna samples were labeled with cy <dig> whereas the reference dna sample - derived from ucd <dig>  the red jungle fowl animal previously selected to generate the chicken reference genome assembly - was labeled with cy <dig> 

we defined conservative parameters for cnv detection to limit false positive calls . within the  <dig> lines used in this study,  <dig>  cnvs with a different start and/or end location on the chicken genome were detected . seventy-five percent of these cnvs are losses. being more conservative, i.e. requiring the cnv to be observed in at least  <dig> samples,  <dig> cnvs  were detected with an average size of  <dig>  kb. the real time pcr validation of  <dig> cnvs ranging in being present in  <dig> to  <dig> samples did give a successful validation of 92%. only one marker in a potential cnv which was detected in only one animal failed validation by showing no difference between the reference sample. these results indicated that the detected cnvs have a high chance of being a real cnvs. furthermore, we could confirm  <dig> of the  <dig> high confidence cnvs  identified by wang et al.  and  <dig> out of the  <dig> cnvs  detected in only one animal in that study. however, we were only able to confirm 21% of the  <dig> cnvs detected in another study  . one reason why fewer cnvs were detected in the studies of wang et al.  <cit>  is the use of only  <dig> and  <dig> animals respectively from three different breeds in those two studies. moreover, both studies used a different reference animal and the reference animal was also from the same breed. also, none of the chicken breeds were in common between our study and those of wang  <cit>  which may account for the lack of complete validation.

the distribution of the gain and loss cnvs over the genome is shown in figure  <dig>  the average size of the cnvs detected in this study is  <dig>  kb, and the largest cnv,  <dig>  mb , was observed on ggaz. cnv distributions within the different chicken lines are given in additional file 1: table s <dig>  although limited sequence information is available for gga <dig> , the repetitive nature of this chromosome  <cit>  was confirmed by detecting copy number variations on the entire sequenced part of this chromosome. another striking case was seen on gga <dig> where  <dig> out of the  <dig> animals showed cnvs in a cnvr covering a substantial part of the genome sequence . interestingly, gga <dig> is one of the more gc-rich chromosomes and it contains a relatively large number of minisatellites  <cit> .

the average number of cnvs per animal was  <dig>  ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  the highest number of cnvs was detected in the commercial white leghorn line with an average of  <dig>  cnv per animal. the lowest number of cnvs was observed in the red jungle fowl  population with an average of  <dig>  cnv per animal, which was expected as an inbred red jungle fowl animal was used as a reference in this study. the commercial broilers showed an average of  <dig>  cnvs per animal. these numbers are considerably higher than those reported by wang et al. , where the average was  <dig> cnvs per animal. even when our analysis is restricted to the autosomes, as was done in the study of wang et al. , we still observe many more cnvs  per individual. a cluster analysis of the samples based on the cnvs detected in each of the animals results in tight clustering of all individuals from the same line .

cnvrs were determined by aggregating overlapping cnvs identified in all samples across the acgh experiments according to the criteria defined by redon et al. . aggregating cnvs into cnvrs resulted in a total of  <dig>  non-overlapping regions covering  <dig> mb, which represent almost  <dig> % of the chicken genome. an example of a cnvr in the chicken is given in figure  <dig>  the largest cvnr detected is located on ggaz  and is  <dig>  mb in size. the number of cnvrs in the chicken is considerably higher than that reported by wang et al.  and wang et al. ,  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. the number of cnvrs in the chicken is comparable to that reported in human  <cit>  and almost  <dig> times higher than in cattle  <cit> .

the 176- kb cnv linked to the late feathering locus  <cit>  was detected in this dataset as cnvr  <dig> on ggaz between positions  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> with a size of  <dig> kb. the segregation of this cnv is shown in figure  <dig>  as expected, we were unable to identify the cnv in intron  <dig> of the sox <dig> gene responsible for the pea-comb phenotype in chicken due to the small size of this cnv , which is below the probe spacing on our array.

line-specific cnvrs
some cnvs were observed only in a single animal whereas others seem to be fixed in all individuals of one specific line. cnvs that are specific for a line or group of lines are of particular interest because these are potential candidates for genes that affect a phenotype specific for that  lines. we therefore identified those cnvs that were either fixed in at least one line  or that were fixed in only a single line or breed .

within the  <dig> different lines used in this study, we identified  <dig> cnvs, comprising a total of  <dig> cnvrs, which were line-specific . the number of cnvrs fixed within a line ranged from  <dig> in the broiler mapping population to  <dig> in the commercial white layer. the number of line-specific cnvrs varied from  <dig> for the broiler mapping populations to  <dig> for the commercial white layer line. the commercial white leghorn line was only represented by two individuals, therefore resulting in a higher number of fixed cnvrs , of which  <dig> were line-specific. of the fixed cnvrs, the number of line-specific cnvrs was high in the experimental lines and the silkie breed .

the silkie breed has a number of striking phenotypic characteristics such as black skin, white feathers and black bones. we therefore investigated whether there is a relation between some of these cnvrs and some of these specific phenotypes. for the silkies,  <dig> fixed cnvrs were detected of which  <dig> were breed-specific .

two significant cnvrs are located on gga <dig>  and have already been described in detail by dorshorst et al.  after fine mapping of the phenotype fibromelanosis  in silkies. the candidate gene involved in pigmentation, the endothelin  <dig> gene , is located within cnvr  <dig>  <cit>  and, when up-regulated, is the primary driver of dermal hyperpigmentation in fm chickens. the potential function of the other eight line-specific cnvrs in silkies is not clear. one of the three silkie line-specific cnvr on gga <dig>  harbours the gene ccr <dig>  which stimulates melanoma migration, and the gene smarca <dig>  a swi/snf-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin. both these genes are potential candidates for traits related to pigmentation. further studies are needed to study the full potential of these line-specific cnvrs.

for lines  <dig> and  <dig>  we detected  <dig> and  <dig> cnvrs respectively, which are fixed in these lines, while only a single cnv and  <dig> cnvrs respectively are line-specific. one of the line-fixed cnvrs for line  <dig>  contains the gene tnfsf13b  superfamily, member 13b) or baff . this candidate gene stimulates b cells to undergo proliferation and to counter apoptosis and was examined in more detail. to confirm this cnvr, we quantified the relative abundance of the dna copy number for tnfsf13b using a taqman assay. quantification of the ovotranferrin gene, known to be in single copy in the chicken genome, was used as an internal reference. a primer probe set spanning exon  <dig> and intron  <dig> of tnfsf13b revealed a significant difference in copy number between line  <dig> when compared to lines  <dig> and n. no difference was detected using a primer probe set spanning intron  <dig> and exon  <dig>  these results suggest that there is partial duplication of tnfr13b, with exon  <dig> duplicated in all lines tested except in lines  <dig> and  <dig>  however, the cnv does not extend as far as exon  <dig> of tnfsf13b, as indicated by the equivalent copy number across all lines at this region of the gene. further characterisation of this cnv will be required to identify its boundaries accurately.

one of the three other line-specific cnvrs , detected in lines  <dig> and  <dig>  and located at gga18: 372390– <dig>  overlaps with the myosin heavy chain gene  <dig> .

comparative cnv analysis
we compared the chicken cnvrs to those previously detected in turkey, duck and zebra finch   <cit> . from the  <dig> inter-specific cnvs detected between turkey and chicken detected by griffin et al.  using comparative cgh,  <dig> did not show variation in the chicken. within the current study,  <dig> of these  <dig> inter-specific cnvs could be verified, whereas the inter-specific cnv on chre <dig> could not be validated because chre <dig> was not used for probe design on the array. from the  <dig> inter-specific regions detected, all  fall into cnvrs detected in this study. the cnv detected in the chicken layer vs. red jungle fowl on gga <dig>  by griffin et al.  could not be confirmed in our study. when comparing the inter-specific zebra finch / chicken cnvs  <cit> ,  <dig> of the  <dig> cnvs  did overlap with a chicken cnvr while of the inter-specific cnvs detected between duck and chicken  <cit> ,  <dig> of the  <dig>  did overlap with a chicken cnvr. these results indicate that the inter-specific cnvs detected are prone to overlap with a cnvr of the avian lineage when more samples are analyzed. fewer cnvrs would be overlapping with inter-specific cnvs between more distant species.

gene content of chicken cnvr
within the  <dig>  cnvrs, a total of  <dig>  unique ensembl peptides were identified based on chicken build  <dig> . to examine whether genes involved in specific pathways or biological processes are more prone to copy number variation, we performed a gene enrichment analysis for the genes located within the cnvrs. the chicken transcript ids were used as input into david for a gene enrichment and ontology analysis  <cit> . terms showing significant enrichments were the go terms “functional constituent of cytoskeleton”, “nuclear binding”, “cellular response to stress”, and “macromolecule catabolic processes”. the go term “functional constituent of cytoskeleton” is mainly driven by the keratin superfamily. the avian keratin genes are over-represented when compared to mammals  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that evolution of archosaurian epidermal appendages in the linage leading to birds was accompanied by duplication and divergence of the ancestral ß-keratin gene cluster. in the chicken, four subfamilies  of the ß-keratin genes have been named in accordance with tissue-specific expression and sequence heterogeneity  <cit> . these ß-keratin gene subfamilies are clustered on gga <dig> whereas the genes for two other monophyletic groups of feather keratins are located on gga <dig> and gga <dig> respectively. we observed large cnvrs  within all three regions in the chicken genome up to  <dig> mb in size. within these cnvrs we observed both cnv losses and gains.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we performed acgh screening of the chicken genome to identify cnvs in a comprehensive manner. we have identified a large number of genes affected by cnv, including genes involved in well-known phenotypes such as late feathering and pigmentation in silkies. in particular large gene families such as the keratin gene family and the mhc show extensive variation in copy number. the cnvs in the chicken overlapping with the inter-specific cnvs  are potentially old cnvs. moreover, when the evolutionary distance between chicken and the other bird species is enlarged the older  the cnv is. many of these cnvs very likely affect traits of economic importance in the chicken and our global characterization of cnvrs in the chicken genome will aid in the identification of structural variation in the genome underlying important phenotype differences for qualitative and quantitative traits.
