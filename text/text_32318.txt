BACKGROUND
the last two decades have seen an exponential increase in the generation of comparative genetic data from within bacterial and viral species. many of the bacterial data sets are derived from electrophoresis-based genotyping methods, such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, which has been used to develop the inter-laboratory pulsenet system for real-time monitoring of foodborne bacterial pathogens  <cit> . more recently, databases of defined genetic polymorphisms have become available. conspicuous examples are multilocus sequence typing  databases  <cit> , the results of comparative genome hybridization  studies on bacteria  <cit> , and whole-genome sequence databases for bacteria and viruses  <cit> .

the extensive knowledge base of comparative genetic information can be exploited to develop rationally-designed genotyping methods for examining epidemiology, or inferring virulence potential, vaccine susceptibility or antimicrobial-antiviral resistance. one approach to discriminating known genotypes within a species is to interrogate every known genetic polymorphism. however, this approach is inefficient due to linkage of alleles, and may also provide more resolving power than is required  <cit> . despite considerable improvements in nucleic acid analysis technology in recent years, there remains a need for cost-effective and rapid genotyping methods that interrogate small sets of polymorphisms and provide the required information in an efficient manner  <cit> . such methods have potential applications in infection control, point-of-care diagnosis, high-throughput public health investigations, food microbiology and biodefense. suitable emerging technology platforms for such marker sets include real-time pcr  <cit> , medium-density arrays  <cit> , and more recently 'lab-on-a-chip' devices  <cit> .

the considerable volume of comparative genetic information now available renders computerized data-mining the only practical means of identifying sets of polymorphisms optimized for particular genotyping tasks. our research group has previously developed and described the "minimum snps" computer program, which extracts resolution-optimized single-nucleotide polymorphism  sets from complex dna sequence alignments  <cit> . previously described capabilities of "minimum snps" included the identification of snp sets that discriminated a single sequence variant from all other know variants , and the identification of snp sets that maximize simpson's index of diversity , and are therefore optimized with respect to discriminating all variants from each other  <cit> . the % module has been applied to the identification of highly informative snps that define specific neisseria meningitidis and staphylococcus aureus variants  <cit> , while the d module has been used to extract d-maximized snp sets from s. aureus and campylobacter jejuni mlst databases  <cit> , and, more recently, to derive d-maximized binary gene sets  from c. jejuni cgh data  <cit> .

other bioinformatics programs that carry out similar functions to "minimum snps" include a linkage disequilibrium-selection algorithm, which identifies snps diagnostic for haplotype blocks in mammalian genomes  <cit> , and snpt, which also incorporates a d maximization module  <cit> . one function notably absent from previous versions of "minimum snps" and similar programs is the ability to identify sets of genetic markers that discriminate a user-defined group of variants from all other known variants. such a function could underpin genotyping methodologies designed to identify all variants within a species that possess specific traits of interest, such as increased virulence or resistance properties. there are several considerations when designing such an algorithm, such as conversion of the user-defined group of sequence variants into a consensus sequence, and scoring of the resolving power of genetic marker sets. here we report a novel algorithm for identifying such genetic marker sets, and its application to the analysis of microbial and viral comparative genetic data.

RESULTS
mlst datasets
the clonal complexes  defined by mlst data are emerging as important epidemiological or taxonomic units  <cit> . therefore it was investigated whether not-n analysis could identify diagnostic snps for major ccs of a variety of bacterial species. in e. coli, two independent mlst schemes were examined. using scheme  <dig>  not-n analysis successfully identified  <dig> snps that completely differentiated the  <dig> major ccs . the second e. coli mlst scheme, which contains a larger cohort of isolates than scheme  <dig>  required  <dig> snps to differentiate the  <dig> major ccs. not-n analysis was unable to completely differentiate the largest cc, with eight snps resolving  <dig> % of the out-group from the group of interest. not-n analysis of the h. influenzae mlst dataset identified  <dig> snps that differentiated the seven major ccs from the remaining st population .

in contrast to h. influenzae and e. coli, not-n analysis was unable to identify high-confidence snps  for four s. aureus and five c. jejuni ccs. these ccs were the largest in their respective databases. the difficulty in identifying snps diagnostic for the larger ccs was investigated further and was found to be due to cc members that have diverged from the cc founders by recombination rather than mutation. s. aureus exhibits a low recombination frequency, with approximately 10% of cc members arising by recombination  <cit> . while mutation predominantly generates single novel snps, recombinants acquire a pre-existing allele from elsewhere in the species. the large pool of alleles present in the larger ccs increases the probability that one or more alleles per locus have arisen by recombination with a pre-existing allele. given that most s. aureus snps are dimorphic, coupled with the effects of recombination and the small pool of available snps in s. aureus sequence data, there exist few snps unique to all members of a cc. therefore, the probability of finding highly discriminatory snp sets is low. in support of this, the not-n algorithm was used to find sets of snps diagnostic for the  <dig> methicillin-resistant s. aureus  sts in the mlst database  <cit> . the mrsa dataset is smaller than the complete s. aureus mlst database, and therefore the ccs contain correspondingly fewer recombinants. this analysis yielded  <dig> snps that delineated the ten major mrsa ccs with 100% confidence .

in c. jejuni, the influence of recombination on not-n performance is similar to s. aureus but is more extreme. the majority of sts in c. jejuni arise by recombination, at an estimated frequency of  <dig> times the rate of mutation  <cit> , resulting in an even smaller probability of identifying cc-specific snps. snp sets diagnostic for s. aureus ccs are more efficiently derived using the d maximization algorithm of "minimum snps", while in c. jejuni, the high recombination rate renders the identification of small numbers of cc-specific snps with high discriminatory power and a low false-negative rate potentially impossible by any means. other researchers have identified small numbers of c. jejuni cc snps characteristic of six major ccs of c. jejuni; st- <dig>  st- <dig>  st- <dig>  st- <dig>  st- <dig> and st- <dig>  <cit> . however, these snps result in a high proportion  of false-negative sts, and may therefore be unsuitable for certain genotyping applications.

the "minimum snps" software has previously been used to derive d-optimized  snp sets from the s. aureus and c. jejuni databases  <cit> . in the case of s. aureus, the genotypes defined by approximately eight d-optimized snps correspond closely to the population structure as defined by eburst analysis. thus, the d-optimized snp sets appear superior to the not-n derived snp sets for assigning an s. aureus isolate to a cc. in the case of c. jejuni, the correspondence between d-optimized snp genotypes and population structure is less than in s. aureus because of the higher recombination frequency. however, adding the interrogation of more loci such as a hypervariable region  to the snp-based genotyping reduced to insignificance the incidence of unrelated isolates failing to be discriminated, thus demonstrating the value of the d-optimized snp set. in summary, for both species, not-n-derived snps are generally not optimal for assigning isolates to larger ccs, but are highly effective for identifying the smaller ccs.

cgh datasets
cgh allows the large-scale identification of genetic differences across a number of strains. bayesian-based algorithms applied to the cgh data of c. jejuni, y. enterocolitica and c. difficile enabled the identification of phylogenetic clades that can predict infection source or pathogenicity traits. champion et al.  <cit>  identified two distinct clades in c. jejuni predictive of infection source, with one clade containing predominantly livestock isolates and the other non-livestock  isolates. isolates identified from human infection were roughly evenly distributed between the two clades. in y. enterocolitica, three clades corresponding to non-pathogenic , low-pathogenicity  and highly pathogenic  were identified by the comparative phylogenomics approach  <cit> . for c. difficile, cgh phylogeny identified four clades comprising a hypervirulent clade, a toxin a-b+ clade, and two clades containing human and animal isolates  <cit> .

the three cgh studies identified binary genes specific to particular clades using macclade, parsimony-based software that is used for reconstructing phylogeny and interpreting patterns of character evolution  <cit> . macclade  <dig> was used to identify  <dig> coding sequences  in c. jejuni that were characteristic of the livestock clade, including the gene cluster cj <dig> to cj <dig> within the o-linked flagellin glycosylation locus. however, none of the  <dig> cds identified by macclade  <dig> analysis were 100% specific to the livestock clade  <cit> . in contrast, not-n analysis identified two binary genes from the c. jejuni cgh data that separated, with 100% confidence, isolates from the livestock clade from those in the nonlivestock clade .

within the y. enterocolitica cgh data, macclade  <dig> analysis identified several cds that were 100% specific to each of the three pathogenicity clades  <cit> . some of these genes, such as ye <dig> , were classed as divergent based on the array signal but considered present for the purposes of the macclade analysis. cgh cannot reliably detect small differences in hybridizations caused by moderate gene divergence  <cit> . for this reason, only genes that were clearly present or absent were analyzed by not-n to remove potential miscalled binary gene status. three binary genes were identified that enabled 100% discrimination between the differing pathogeneses of y. enterocolitica. in c. difficile, macclade analysis did not identify binary gene sets specific for isolates within the four clades, and many of the identified genes were divergent  <cit> . in comparison, not-n analysis identified four binary genes that separated the four distinct clades described by stabler et al.  <cit>  with 100% confidence. these results demonstrate that the application of not-n to cgh data was both more efficient and able to identify fewer binary targets than macclade analyses .

viral sequence datasets
a large number of complete genome sequences are currently available for both hcv  and hiv- <dig>   <cit> , providing an ideal resource to examine the performance of not-n analysis on well-characterized loci within these viruses. despite examining several loci, not-n analysis was unable to identify snps diagnostic for any of the hiv- <dig> clades. this is likely due to the exceptionally high degree of recombination between hiv- <dig> variants that has resulted in the emergence of circulating recombinant forms   <cit> . given these results, and the acceptance of sequencing as the appropriate hiv- <dig> genotyping approach, it was concluded that not-n derived snps are not suitable for hiv- <dig> genotyping. in contrast, not-n analysis identified  <dig> hcv snps that delineate, with 100% confidence, the  <dig> predominant subtypes of this virus . interestingly, not-n analysis failed to identify comparably informative snp sets for the six major genotype groups  of hcv, possibly as a consequence of the high level of divergence between subtypes within each genotype group.

asubtypes containing less than four confirmed sequences were not included in the analysis. sequences were downloaded from the hepatitis c virus  sequence database  <cit> .

bthe single-nucleotide polymorphism  position refers to a  <dig> bp fragment of the rna-dependent rna polymerase ns5b spanning nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> . ns5b is used to construct phylogenetic trees for hcv, which form the basis of the genotype and subtype nomenclature  <cit> .

*snp discriminates multiple subtypes.

current hcv genotyping methods such as the line probe assay   <cit> , the real-time pcr-based abbott hcv analyte-specific reagent  and cobas taqman <dig> hcv tests  <cit> , restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis  <cit>  and primer extension methods  <cit>  primarily target the 5' non-coding region . a drawback of targeting the 5'-ncr is that some subtypes, such as 1a and 1b, 1b and 6a, or 2a and 2c, remain indistinguishable in a small number of cases due to the conserved nature of this region  <cit> . in contrast, the  <dig> hcv snps identified by not-n analysis were derived from rna-polymerase ns5b rather than the 5'ncr, and unlike 5'-ncr-derived snps, are 100% specific for each of the  <dig> subtypes of hcv. this finding is significant as the correlation between hcv genotype and clinical outcome is well-documented. genotype-specific differences between hcv variants aid in assessing the clinical management of infection, with genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> more resistant than genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> to interferon-α-based therapy. in addition, hcv variants appear specific to particular geographic regions, such as the widespread distribution of hcv subtype 1a throughout the usa and northern europe  <cit> .

to our knowledge, this is the first set of genotyping targets that enables the specific and accurate discrimination of the  <dig> major subtypes of hcv. real-time pcr-based methods, such as allele-specific real-time pcr  <cit>  or high-resolution melt analysis  <cit> , are promising candidates for interrogating the  <dig> snps due to their ability to accurately interrogate polymorphisms in diverse dna sequence, such as that found within the ns5b region of hcv.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has shown that the not-n algorithm provides a practical tool for identifying diagnostic polymorphisms that discriminate bacterial or viral populations of interest. not-n analysis was particularly valuable with bacterial cgh and hcv genome sequence data, where the software identified genetic markers with superior performance to polymorphisms in current use. the ability of the algorithm to select snps diagnostic for mlst-defined ccs was dependent on cc size, with large numbers of snps required to delineate the larger ccs that have undergone extensive recombination. the purpose of the not-n algorithm is conceptually similar to the identification of canonical phylogenetic snps, such as those previously described for bacillus anthracis  <cit> , and indeed would be valuable for identifying canonical snps in other clonal populations. not-n analysis is likely to become increasingly useful as comparative databases expand in size, and as more is uncovered about the relationships between pathogen genotype, infection epidemiology and clinical outcomes. this approach to data analysis may also be applied to the identification of discriminatory sets of genetic polymorphisms that have direct biological significance, rather than being simply diagnostic markers. in such instances, it may not be so critical for the "0% false negative" criterion to be fulfilled. this allows an approach in which the analysis is carried out twice, with one or other of the two groups of variants defined as the "group of interest" in each case. this increases the probability that informative sets of polymorphisms will be identified.
