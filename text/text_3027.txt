BACKGROUND
the intestinal barrier is the largest interface between man and the external environment, and the maintenance of its integrity has an important role in preserving health. when intestinal barrier function is compromised, it can become "leaky" allowing pathogens and toxins to enter the body. the function of the intestinal barrier is compromised in human conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases   <cit> , irritable bowel syndrome  <cit>  and some kinds of food-borne infections  <cit> . moreover, intestinal barrier function can be temporarily impaired during times of stress  <cit>  and it inevitably deteriorates with aging  <cit> . in addition, increased intestinal permeability can also result in pathological changes in distant organs and tissues, which can lead to further complications in susceptible individuals such as asthma  <cit> , chronic heart failure  <cit> , type-1-diabetes  <cit> , chronic fatigue syndrome  <cit>  and depression  <cit> .

a critical component of the intestinal barrier is the intercellular junction complexes between adjacent intestinal epithelial cells which form a semi-permeable diffusion barrier. these intercellular complexes consist of tight junctions, adherens junctions, desmosomes and gap junctions  <cit> . the tight junctions are the most apical and are responsible for controlling the permeability of the paracellular pathway. tight junctions are formed by protein dimers that span the space between adjacent cell membranes. there are over  <dig> proteins with well recognised roles in tight junction formation. these proteins can be divided into three functional categories: 1) bridge proteins which form a web between adjacent cell membranes; 2) plaque proteins which anchor bridge proteins to the actin cytoskeleton; and 3) dual location proteins which are not continuously associated with the tight junctions and also act as transcription factors.

the maintenance or enhancement of intestinal barrier function is a beneficial property that some probiotic bacteria exert. some probiotics have been shown to ameliorate intestinal permeability induced by pathogens in vitro  <cit> ; whereas, others probiotic bacteria have been shown to enhance tight junction integrity between intestinal epithelial cells that are not weakened  <cit> . existing mechanistic studies have focused on the ability of probiotics to prevent alterations to few tight junction bridging proteins in disease models, e.g. the effect of vsl# <dig> on dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis in mice  <cit>  and the effect of lactobacillus plantarum cgmcc  <dig> on enteroinvasive e. coli atcc  <dig> -induced barrier disruption in vitro  <cit> . the effect of probiotics on tight junction proteins in a healthy intestinal barrier have not been reported, nor the effect of probiotic bacteria on epithelial cell genes involved in the whole tight junction signalling pathway, including those encoding for bridging, plaque and dual location tight junction proteins. alteration of tight junction signalling in healthy humans is a potential mechanism that could lead to the strengthening of the intestinal barrier, resulting in limiting the ability of antigens to enter the body and potentially triggering undesirable immune responses.

the hypothesis of this research was that probiotic bacteria that increase intestinal barrier function achieve this, partly, by increasing the expression of the genes involved in tight junction signalling in healthy intestinal epithelial cells. l. plantarum mb <dig> isolated from the probiotic product vsl# <dig> was chosen as the test bacterium because it has a robust, repeatable, positive effect tight junction integrity, as measured by the trans-epithelial electrical resistance  in vitro . vls# <dig>  which is a mixture of eight bacteria including l. plantarum mb <dig>  has previously been reported to enhance tight junction integrity in vitro  <cit> , reduce colitis in rodent models  <cit>  and improve human intestinal health  <cit> . the effect of l. plantarum mb <dig> on intestinal epithelial cells was investigated in vitro using human colon cancer cells , a commonly used model of the intestinal epithelium that spontaneously form tight junctions between adjacent cells, and trans-epithelial electrical resistance assays, whole genome microarray analysis, and fluorescent microscopy of tight junction proteins.

RESULTS
effect of l. plantarum mb <dig> on teer was dose-dependent
the ability of l. plantarum mb <dig> to increase intestinal barrier function was investigated by determining the effect on teer using different concentrations of l. plantarum mb <dig> . at an od <dig> nm of  <dig>   l. plantarum mb <dig> did not cause an increase in teer compared to the untreated controls. at an od <dig> nm of  <dig>   l. plantarum mb <dig> caused an increase in teer of 15-20% compared to the untreated controls at  <dig> and  <dig> hours. at an od <dig> nm of  <dig>   l. plantarum mb <dig> caused an increase in teer of 42-51% compared to the untreated controls from  <dig> to  <dig> hours. the effect of l. plantarum mb <dig> on teer was 19-27% higher at an od <dig> nm of  <dig>  compared to od <dig> nmof  <dig>  . similarly, the effect of l. plantarum mb <dig> on teer was 23-33% higher at an od <dig> nm of  <dig>  compared to od <dig> nm of  <dig>  .

the drop in teer for all treatments between  <dig> and  <dig> hours observed in all assays was likely due to the caco- <dig> cell monolayers being disturbed by the change in media during the sample addition after the initial readings. the increase in teer over time for the control caco- <dig> cells was likely due to an increase in nutrient availability after the fresh media was added at the beginning of the experiment. the increases in teer caused by l. plantarum mb <dig> were additional to those observed with fresh media.

l. plantarum mb <dig> was also able to increase the teer by  <dig> at  <dig> hours to 64% at  <dig> hours across differentiated caco- <dig> cells  in the same manner as for confluent, undifferentiated cells . a differentiated, polarised caco- <dig> cell monolayer better represents the human intestinal barrier than confluent undifferentiated caco- <dig> cells. the tight junctions between the differentiated caco-2s were better formed than the undifferentiated caco-2s , were less affected by the media addition  and had less variation between replicates .

l. plantarum mb <dig> altered the expression of genes involved tight junction formation
the ability of l. plantarum mb <dig> to alter gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells was measured using global gene expression analysis. the analysis indicated that  <dig>  caco- <dig> cell genes were differentially expressed  when co-cultured with l. plantarum mb452; the expression levels of  <dig> genes were increased and  <dig> genes were decreased. the relatively low fold-change cut-off of  <dig>  was selected because the comparison was between untreated healthy cells and healthy cells treated with potential beneficial bacteria so large differences  were not expected. the ten ingenuity pathway analysis  functional groups with the most differentially expressed genes and the gene ontology categories with the lowest p-values are summarised in additional file  <dig> tables s <dig> and s <dig> 

of the genes that were differentially expressed in response to l. plantarum mb <dig>   <dig> were involved in tight junction formation . analysis of kegg pathways using ease showed that the tight junction pathway was one of four pathways that was enriched with differentially expressed genes . the molecular interactions between these genes were visualised in an ipa network diagram . the nodes with the most interactions are those that represent the genes for occludin, zo- <dig>  zo- <dig> and cingulin.

the expression levels of seven genes was also quantified using real-time pcr  and was compared with the gene expression data obtained using microarray analysis . of the  <dig> genes that had increased expression in the microarray analysis, occludin and cingulin were shown to have increased expression in response to l. plantarum mb <dig> using qrt-pcr. three other genes were differentially expressed in the microarray analysis but not in the qrt-pcr analysis. the cldn <dig> gene was not differentially expressed in the microarray or qrt-pcr analyses. the gja <dig> gene had decreased expression in the microarray analysis  and increased expression in the qrt-pcr analysis . the variation between the gene expression results obtained between the two techniques is likely due to the fact that the qrt-pcr probes used did not recognise the same transcripts as the microarray probes, which is the most common reason for discrepancies between results of the two methods. it has been shown that when qrt-pcr and microarray probes recognise the same transcripts there is an accordance of results with 87% of genes; whereas, when the qrt-pcr and microarray probes do not recognise the same transcripts there is an accordance of only 41%  <cit> . these data indicated an accordance for 43% of the genes  using the two methods.

l. plantarum mb <dig> altered the expression of other tight junction associated genes
eight genes encoding for cytoskeleton tubulin proteins had decreased expression levels  in caco- <dig> cells treated with l. plantarum mb <dig> . similarly, seven genes encoding for protein degrading proteasomes had decreased expression levels  in caco- <dig> cells treated with l. plantarum mb <dig> .

l. plantarum mb <dig> visually increased the abundance of tight junction proteins
using fluorescent microscopy the intensity of the immuno-stained zo- <dig>  zo- <dig> occludin and cingulin proteins appeared higher in the caco- <dig> cells treated with l. plantarum mb <dig> than in the untreated controls . this indicated that the changes in gene expression observed were supported by changes in tight junction-associated protein intensity.

discussion
as hypothesised, this study showed that l. plantarum mb <dig> altered the expression levels of tight junction-related genes in healthy intestinal epithelial cells. of the tight junction bridging proteins, occludin mrna abundance was higher in the presence of l. plantarum mb <dig>  the over-expression of the occludin protein has been linked to increased teer  <cit> , and based on the findings of this study, increased occludin gene expression may contribute to the ability of l. plantarum mb <dig> to enhance tight junction integrity. in support of this, genes encoding for the occludin-associated plaque proteins, zo- <dig> and zo- <dig> and cingulin, also had increased expression levels in the presence of l. plantarum mb <dig>  the zonula occludens bind to the cytoplasmic end of occludin and form the scaffolding to link occludin to the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . the increased expression levels of the occludin, zo- <dig>  zo- <dig> and cingulin genes appeared to correlate with increased intensity of their proteins as indicated by the fluorescent microscopy images.

in contrast, other genes that had increased transcript levels in the presence of l. plantarum mb <dig> are known to be involved in tight junction disassembly. the gene encoding itch, an ubiquitin-ligase molecule, had increased expression levels in the presence of l. plantarum mb452; however, the itch protein is known to contribute to the degradation of occludin  <cit> . the increased expression of the itch gene may lead to an increase in the turnover of occludin protein and, therefore, may have contributed to the increased occludin mrna noted in this data. the gene encoding the snai <dig> protein also had increased expression in the presence of l. plantarum mb452; however, the snai <dig> protein is known to bind to occludin and claudin genes promoters suppressing their expression  <cit> . although these two genes, itch and snai <dig>  have been linked to tight junction disassembly,  <dig> out of the  <dig> tight junction-related genes with increased expression levels in response to l. plantarum mb <dig> exposure contribute to tight junction stability; therefore, the cumulative effect would most likely be enhanced intestinal barrier function.

the 'tightness' of tight junctions is commonly thought to be, at least partly, due to claudins, which are a set of bridging proteins; however, none of the claudin genes were differentially expressed in response to l. plantarum mb <dig>  decreases in the abundance of claudin- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> proteins  have been associated with a decrease in teer  <cit> . another study showed that a decrease in teer was associated with altered cellular localisation of claudin- <dig> and - <dig>  but not altered abundance  <cit> , so it is possible that l. plantarum mb <dig> may have altered the distribution of claudin proteins without changing gene expression and/or protein abundance.

the results of this study showed that l. plantarum mb <dig> enhanced the expression of  <dig> genes involved in the tight junction signalling pathway in healthy cells. a previous study showed that l. plantarum cgmcc  <dig> is able to protect against the disruption of four tight junction proteins caused by enteroinvasive e. coli atcc  <dig>   <cit> . however, another study looking at the effect of l. plantarum atcc <dig> on the expression of genes in caco- <dig> cells challenged with enteroinvasive e. coli atcc <dig>  did not report any changes in tight junction gene expression  <cit> . this suggests that the l. plantarum protection against tight junction disruption was not due to it altering host gene expression, and was likely due to it inhibiting the action of the pathogen in that study.

the ability to enhance the expression of tight junction-related genes is not common to all l. plantarum strains. in addition to the study that showed that l. plantarum atcc <dig> nullifies changes in caco- <dig> cell gene expression induced by enteroinvasive e. coli atcc <dig>   <cit> , other published studies investigating whole genome expression in response to l. plantarum have shown that, l. plantarum wcfsi induces increased expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and cellular growth and development in healthy human duodenum  <cit>  and l. plantarum  alters the nf-κb pathway to limit inflammatory responses in healthy human duodenum  <cit> . however, in these published studies only a few tight junction-related genes had altered expression levels when exposed to l. plantarum, for example increased expression of the zo- <dig> gene, so they are unlikely to contribute to changes in tight junction integrity, compared to the changes in  <dig> tight junction genes induced by l. plantarum mb <dig> reported in this study. this is not surprising since strains of l. plantarum can have differing effects on intestinal barrier function in vitro, from neutral  to beneficial , and thus, it is likely that different strains may also have different effects on epithelial cell gene expression.

the observed increase in intestinal barrier function induced by l. plantarum mb <dig> may also be, at least partly, due to changes in intestinal epithelial cell gene expression that have an indirect effect on tight junction stability. eight genes encoding for tubulins had lower expression levels in response to l. plantarum mb <dig>  a high turnover in tubulin synthesis has been linked to the disassembly of tight junctions  <cit> ; thus, the reduced expression levels of these genes may account for the positive effect of l. plantarum mb <dig> on intestinal barrier function. similarly, seven genes encoding for proteasome subunits had lower mrna abundance in the presence of l. plantarum mb <dig>  proteasomes, which are large protein complexes responsible for breaking down surplus or damaged proteins, have previously been linked to tight junction degradation, and proteasome inhibitors can prevent degradation of occludin  <cit>  and zo- <dig>  <cit> . the reduction in proteasome gene expression induced by l. plantarum mb <dig> may be an additional mechanism by which tight junction integrity is enhanced.

several of the tight junction-related genes with altered expression induced by l. plantarum mb <dig> may also be involved in reducing cell proliferation. for example, zo- <dig>  which had increased gene expression in the presence of l. plantarum mb <dig>  is a 'dual location protein' involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. the zo- <dig> protein binds to the csda protein  and sequesters it to tight junctions, and removal of the csda protein from nucleus in this way results in a reduction in the cdk <dig> protein  <cit> . therefore, an increase in zo- <dig> gene expression may lead to a decrease in cdk <dig> gene expression as seen here , which highlights the link between the formation of tight junctions and a reduction in cell proliferation  <cit> . additionally, l. plantarum mb <dig> reduced the expression of the cpsf <dig> gene, which encodes a protein which is part of the cstf-cpsf-sympk complex, that regulates cell-cycle related gene expression and promotes cell proliferation  <cit> . together with the decreased expression of tubulin genes, these effects of l. plantarum mb <dig> on the zo- <dig>  cdk <dig> and cpsf <dig> genes may lead to decreased cell proliferation and contribute to the reported anti-proliferative effect of the vsl# <dig> product  <cit> .

l. plantarum mb <dig> did not alter the expression levels of other genes and pathways that have been affected by some probiotic bacteria, such as the nf-κb pathway  <cit> , pparγ  <cit> , innate immune response pathway  <cit> , or human β defensin- <dig>  <cit> . this indicates that, unlike some other probiotic bacteria, l. plantarum mb <dig> does not seem to exert its beneficial effect by regulating host immune responses in healthy intestinal cells.

in this study using l. plantarum mb <dig> alone, only certain effects previously associated with vsl# <dig> were observed. vsl# <dig> is a mixture of l. plantarum, l. casei, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus, b. longum, b. breve, b. infantis and streptococcus thermophilus, and is likely that each bacterial species has a range of effects. a previous study indicated that of the bacterial strains present in vsl# <dig>  the culture supernatant of b. infantis was associated with the greatest increase in teer across caco- <dig> cells compared to untreated controls  <cit> . of the vsl# <dig> lactobacilli, l. plantarum mb <dig> produced the supernatant with the greatest effect of teer, which is in agreement with previous work that showed the beneficial effects of l. plantarum mb <dig> supernatant  <cit> . other studies indicated that the anti-inflammatory effects of vsl# <dig> are, at least partially, due to vsl# <dig> bifidobacteria decreasing the abundance of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig>  <cit>  and l. casei in vsl# <dig> reducing the abundance the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma-induced protein  <dig>  <cit> . the genes encoding for these cytokines were not altered in response to l. plantarum mb <dig> in the present study.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented in this study shows that a probiotic, l. plantarum mb <dig>  enhanced intestinal barrier function by affecting the expression of genes in the tight junction signalling pathway in health intestinal epithelial cells, in particular the genes encoding occludin and its associated plaque proteins, zo- <dig>  zo- <dig> and cingulin. further studies will investigate the function of these key genes and evaluate their role in l. plantarum mb <dig> mediated changes in intestinal barrier function. these results also highlight that changes in intestinal barrier function may also be linked to changes in tubulin and/or proteasome gene expression. further targeted studies will investigate whether these gene expression changes are important in the observed enhanced intestinal barrier function, and, if so, the mechanisms involved. the long-term aim is to understand the way in which bacteria increase tight junction integrity in order to develop probiotic foods that enhance intestinal barrier function and therefore improve human wellness.
