BACKGROUND
the grapevine cultivated in europe  is subject to diseases due to many bioagressors, notably obligate fungal and oomycete parasites such as powdery mildew  and downy mildew . control of epidemics requires numerous chemical treatments with harmful effects on the environment and human health. in addition to plant breeding and biological control, the use of plant defense stimulators  could be a promising alternative.

usually acting on the plant and not directly on the pathogen, elicitors induce a multi-factorial plant resistance which is probably more difficult to overcome by the pathogen than protection provided by an single-site fungicide  <cit> . there are a wide variety of abiotic or biotic elicitors of animal, plant, fungal or bacterial origin  <cit> . in recent years, considerable progresses have been made to identify the mode of action of elicitors on various plant models and to identify the genes involved in defense responses  <cit> . the induced immunity activates a wide variety of defense mechanisms that involve passive defense mechanisms  <cit>  that restrict the entry or spread of the pathogen in the plant, but also active defense mechanisms that prevent the development of the pathogen by confining it to the site of infection or causing its death. the most common early cellular responses are mechanisms of ion flux changes, production of reactive oxygen species  and phosphorylation mechanisms/dephosphorylation  is being established  <cit> . sar requires systemic movement of signals from the infected tissue to healthy tissue. molecules such as salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , ethylene , systemin and even hydrogen peroxide, which are involved in the different signaling pathways, are activated in response to elicitation . they rapidly accumulate in the cell and allow the defense genes to be expressed. regulating defenses by sa, ja/et is complex and to date these signaling pathways have appeared to interact with each other  <cit> . following the defense reaction, the intracellular signaling pathways in plants converge towards the production of active forms of oxygen and hormones . final steps correspond to the induction of defense genes, the production of secondary metabolites  and the strengthening of cell walls, which all contribute to stopping the development of the pathogen  <cit> . however, despite considerable progress in understanding the activity of elicitors and their reproducible effects in controlled laboratory conditions, their application in natura on crops such as grapevine has been rather disappointing  <cit> .

in view of this situation, greater insight is needed into grapevine immune responses in relation to the genetic background of the plant, pathogen diversity and environmental conditions. preliminary studies in our laboratory allowed us to select potential elicitors with a defined chemical composition, and which have stable reproducible efficiency under controlled conditions against the two major pathogens of grape: powdery mildew  and downy mildew . we focused particularly on phosphonates and benzothiadiazole ), which are already known as stimulators of plant defenses . bth has been shown to be effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens in various plants , with no direct antifungal activity, thereby clearly establishing its role as an inducer that is dependent on the salicylic acid  pathway  <cit> . according to its mode of action, bth is classified by frac  in p <dig> group, no reporting any resistance phenomenon until now. fosetyl-aluminum ]), is a phosphonate used against diseases caused by oomycetes  <cit> . the mode of action of fos is multi-site which avoids resistance phenomenons, being classified by frac in  <dig> group. it is remarkable that according to frac, few resistance cases have been reported in few pathogens after more than 30 years of utilization. it has a complex mode of action with a direct effect on pathogens at high doses as well as an indirect activity thanks to enhanced plant defense responses at low doses  <cit> . phosphonates have been widely studied for their role as phytoalexin inducer .

to monitor the activity of these compounds in the field, it is possible to assess their defense inducer effect by analyzing the expression of a significant number of marker genes involved in the defense process of grapevine. recently, two molecular diagnostic tools were designed that provide information about the defense status of grapevine: “qpfd”  which was first developed on the apple scab model  and extended to grapevine and evaluates a set of nine groups representing  <dig> target genes   <cit> ; and “biomolchem”chip which is based on  <dig> marker genes highly involved in grapevine defense mechanisms  <cit> . however, a more accurate diagnostic tool would certainly require a larger number of defense markers since genomic analyses have shown that induction of the plant immune system is linked to changes in the expression of thousands of genes  <cit> . recently, considerable progress has been made in the development of automated platforms that enable the high-throughput analysis of gene expression by q-pcr  <cit> , notably involving microfluidic chips.

here, we describe the construction of a new “neovigen96” chip allowing the detection of  <dig> defense markers and  <dig> genes used for standardization of expression  on  <dig> cdna preparations in a single run. the chip was used to study the inducer activity of bth and fos in leaves collected in the field.

the general idea of this work is not to demonstrate that these bth and fos applications should be used as they are performed in this article in the context of conventional programs to protect the grapevine, but to demonstrate that it is possible to test the effects of potential elicitor products on grapevine defense responses with the fluidigm tool. the resulting data provide better understanding of grapevine defense status with a view to optimizing the potential of plant defense elicitors.

RESULTS
“neovigen 96” chip conception and validation
induction of plant immunity implements molecular signaling cascades that ultimately lead to different levels of mechanical and chemical protection. typically, this inducible resistance system is controlled by phytohormones such as salicylic acid   <cit> , jasmonic acid and ethylene, leading to the coordinated accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins , the production of phytoalexins and the reinforcement of plant cell walls  <cit> .

we used various strategies in order to obtain the most recent molecular data and find homologs to the already known responsive gene sequences and find new targets. an additional file shows the origin of the sequences and/or references used to find new candidate genes involved in grapevine defenses . the strategy combines two approaches : the first was based on the comparison of new grapevine genomic data with known grapevine sequences previously selected from pathogen-related studies to which were added genes deployed in two recently developed molecular diagnostic tools . the sequences used in rt-qpcr were blasted against the most recent vitis vinifera sequences  using the blast resource from the national center for biotechnology information . nucleotide sequences were used and results were manually curated to find homologs to the original sequences used in the rt-qpcr experiments. homology was confirmed by aligning selected sequences with clustal  <cit>  and generating phylogenetic trees. once recovered, the sequences to be included in the fluidigm protocol were subjected to the primer-blast program  <cit>  for specific primer design.

the second strategy combined with the first involved the recovery of sequences from the model organism a. thaliana in the genevestigator database  <cit> . micro-array experiments involving foliar fungal pathogens deposited in genevestigator were selected and the most differentially expressed plant sequences between control and treated samples were recovered. these sequences  were identified on the ncbi website and aligned against the most recent vitis vinifera sequences using the ncbi blast resource. the mean percentage of vitis vinifera protein sequence homology/ortology with those of arabidopsis thaliana and/or malus domestica was 53%, between  <dig> and  <dig> .

the combination of the two strategies gave rise to  <dig> new vitis sequences included in the fluidigm protocol . the gene set included reference genes , pr proteins , some genes involved in secondary metabolites  and indole pathway , others involved in the oxido-reduction system , in the ethylene or oxylipine/ja pathways , cell wall reinforcement  and others involved in pathogen detection-signaling and transcription signaling .table  <dig> genes used in “biomolchem” chip that were analyzed in the stratagene mx3005p qpcr system, classified according to functions and pathways

we verified that the qpcr was specific for each primer set  by checking the appropriate size of the amplified product on agarose gel  and obtained a single peak in the melting curve after each qpcr run. we also checked that the pcr efficiencies for each primer set were similar , thereby allowing us to simplify pfaffl’s model formula for calculating relative expression  <cit>  with 2- ΔΔcq .

method sensitivities
the cq values obtained on a subset of  <dig> genes were compared for the same samples in two real-time pcr systems: the stratagene mx3005p and the biomark hd, a fluidigm® integrated fluidic circuits  by automating pcr reactions in nanoliter volumes  <cit> . twenty-two out of  <dig> mrnas exhibited lower cq values in the fluidigm dynamic array than those obtained with the stratagene mx3005p , suggesting that the microfluidic technology exhibited a greater sensitivity than the stratagene while the amounts of cdna used in this technique were 70– <dig> times lower .fig.  <dig> cq value comparisons using  <dig>  dynamic array and stratagene mx3005p. cdnas were synthesized using polydt primers and 10 μg of total rna from leaves untreated  or treated with bth , fosetyl-al . bars represent the means of ct values from three biological replicates. open bars: stratagene mx3005p system and closed bars:  <dig>  fluidigm dynamic array

eleven genes were selected to test the stability of their expression in all of the samples studied  so as to identify constitutive markers that could be used to normalize qpcr results. multiple-gene normalization was based on the principles and formulas described by vandesompele  <cit> . genes were considered as stable when their m values were less than  <dig>  . in our study, all selected genes were considered stable  and multiple-gene normalization was performed with the geometric mean of all reference genes as an accurate normalization factor. the most stable genes in the samples studied were thioryl <dig>  tua, tip <dig>  gapdh and ef1γ  with m values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the optimal number of genes required for normalization of rt-pcr data was fixed with these  <dig> genes for subsequent experiments with a second “neovigen 96” chip version.fig.  <dig> expression stability mean values . m values of  <dig> endogenous control genes in leaf samples using the principles and formulas described by vandesompele.  <cit>  values are means ± sd of  <dig> independent microfluidic dynamic arrays




we compared fold-change expression of defense-related gene in the same samples measured by the  <dig>  dynamic array with those obtained from the “biomolchem” chip with the stratagene mx3005p . fold change comparisons were similar between the two platforms, which indicated a perfect significant correlation between the two technologies  = <dig> ; p-value <  <dig> ). the maximum fold change detected by the stratagene was  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  by the  <dig>  dynamic array .fig.  <dig> correlation scatter plots of fold expression of “biomolchem” chip genes  using stratagene or biomark hd systems obtained with three replicates of leaves treated with bth , with fos  or untreated . correlation of fold expression obtained by stratagene mx3005p system  and microfluidic dynamic array . r

grapevine protection induced by bth and fos treatments
the effect of bth and fos on downy mildew was evaluated. the mode of action of bth is only through stimulation of plant defenses  <cit> , while that of fos is more complex with direct and indirect effects  <cit> . previous studies showed that this complex mode depends on the dose applied by soil drenching  <cit> , with an indirect effect at low dose  and a direct effect at high dose . in our study, fos was applied on grapevine foliage at the authorized dose  for which a direct action has already been shown leading to an inhibition of  <dig> % of downy mildew spores germination at a dose  <dig> times lower   <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that treatment of grapevine leaves with bth and fos in field conditions led to a significant reduction in downy mildew symptoms compared to untreated control leaves, with a better efficiency of fos. the severity of grapevine downy mildew  in fos and bth-treated blocks at the end of 28th july were  <dig> and 70% lower than on untreated blocks, respectively . area under disease progress curves   <cit> , which summarize repeated data such as the change in intensity of an epidemic as a unique value , were  <dig> and 45% lower than in untreated controls, respectively .fig.  <dig> efficacy of potential defense inducers on leaves against grapevine downy mildew . tests were carried out on a randomized block design with  <dig> blocks and  <dig> grapevine plants per block of cabernet sauvignon. three modalities were studied: untreated, treated every week with 1kg ha- <dig> of active ingredient of bth  and treated with  <dig>  kg ha- <dig> of active ingredient of fosetyl aluminum . treatments were carried out between 3rd may and 19th july  <dig>  and with artificial inoculation performed on 19th may  <dig> . disease severity was assessed  <dig> times between 9th june  <dig>  and 28th july by assessing the extent of attack on  <dig> leaves per block during the season. leaves were sampled throughout the season: before any treatment to check the homogeneity of the parcel , 48 h after the second treatment , 48 h after the third treatment and just before artificial inoculation , 48 h after artificial inoculation , then later, 48 h after the seventh treatment

as we observed in preliminary trials, significant effects with this treatment program were observed on the grapevine physiology , analyses of yield and fruit quality were made at harvest carried out the 11th october  <dig> . bth and fos had a significant protective effect on grapevine leaves  and on grape berries  and the harvest was  <dig>  times higher in the treated vines  than in the untreated vines . the grapes harvested from plants treated with bth were  <dig> times smaller than those harvested from plants treated with fos but identical to grapes harvested in the untreated plants  with berries  <dig>  times smaller than those of fos-treated and untreated plants  . no difference was observed in ph, acidity and sugar in sugar content .table  <dig> assessment of the yield and the fruit quality at the harvest carried out on 11th october 2011

we are quite aware that the field test presented in this study will never be used by the profession: it only served as a example to validate this tool for assessing grapevine defense status in the natural environment, and in no case to develop this alternative strategy .

the molecular tool used for several years in previous tests  was limited when we wanted to test the grapevine defense status in vineyard. we needed to increase the throughput of gene expression analyses.

we developed the fluidgm tool, and in this paper, we underline its power, which has a throughput 60– <dig> times higher and uses amounts of cdna 70– <dig> times smaller than with conventional qpcr assays. only the second sample in this field trial was analyzed by the two technologies.

defense-related gene expressions in elicited grapevine leaves
as the expected action of these potentially eliciting products is rather preventive than curative and because preliminary studies  <cit>  showed that the pathogen diverts the plant metabolism in its favor and particular by blocking the deployment of its defenses, we chose a sampling protocol rather early in the season when the period of grapevine sensitivity against downy mildew is the strongest than later after the pathogen inoculation or once the epidemic is in place at a time when there was no real point in tracking the defense status of the vine. the grapevine defense reaction was analyzed 48 h after a second elicitor treatment applied in the vineyard. twelve leaves at a similar stage were taken for each modality 2 days after the second treatment . among the genes involved in pathogen detection- signaling- transcription, bth induced  >  <dig> ) the genes involved in the sa and et pathways, with the sa-dependent  gene, sa-methyl transferase , the enzyme involved in ethylene biosynthesis  and a transcription factor  .fig.  <dig> “heatmap” representing relative expression of genes in log <dig> transformations. expression levels of  <dig> defense-related genes involved in pathogen detection-signaling-transcription , in secondary metabolite biosynthesis , coding for pr-proteins , involved in cell wall reinforcement , in oxylipins/ja and et biosynthesis  and redox status  were assessed using a relative method with multiple-gene normalization  in grapevine leaves treated with bth  or fos  compared to untreated leaves. values are means ± sd of three independent biological replicates. the color gradient leading to blue for genes repressed  < 0), to red for genes over-expressed  > 0) and white for genes exhibiting no modification in their expression  = 0). numbers in brackets: number of genes involved in the function

all of these results corroborated our previous study showing that bth enhances resistance against plasmopara viticola by up-regulating the pr proteins . the most induced gene was pr <dig> which is usually reported to be a typical marker of sar  <cit> . a rapid over-expression of three genes coding for key enzymes was observed in the phenylpropanoid pathway  and in the sa biosynthesis pathway . one gst gene coding for an enzyme involved in the redox status of the plant and an acc gene involved in the ethylene pathway were also strongly up-regulated.  <cit>  the same defense response pathway may therefore be observed in grapevine leaves in the vineyard to that observed in laboratory conditions.

upon fos treatment, only the eds1a, aco1a genes were significantly up-regulated and a significant repression of an ein3-dependent regulation of plant ethylene hormone signaling  and genes coding for important components of the resistance gene ja-dependent  was observed.

the expression level of defense-related genes in fos-treated leaves was less intense with only  <dig> % of differentiated genes, 25% of them being up-regulated. fos treatment induced a less strong over-expression of pr1-pr <dig>  and the repression of pr <dig> while it was over-expressed with bth, and a less strong repression of pr7bis. genes encoding pr7- pr <dig> and pr <dig> in bth-treated leaves were repressed while they were over-expressed with fos treatment. two major genes in the biosynthetic pathway of phenylpropanoids  were significantly over-expressed in leaves treated with bth while only pal, which is also involved in the sa pathway, was differentially over-expressed in fos-treated leaves, with expression levels two-fold and five-fold higher in bth-treated leaves than in fos-treated ones and untreated controls, respectively. similarly, two major genes of the biosynthetic pathway of stilbene  were strongly linked to resistance induced by bth.

these results are in agreement with data obtained in previous experiments conducted in controlled laboratory conditions  <cit>  and also in another where pal and sts were reported to be major genes in the resistance of vitis vinifera  <cit> .

principal component analysis  was used to summarize the ways in which gene defense responses vary after elicitation. most of the variance in the defense expression dataset was contained in the first two principal components which captured ~ 60% of the total variability . results of pca based on the subset of the  <dig> vitis vinifera defense-related genes common to the two technologies  summarized the  <dig> samples projected on the two principal components . statistical similarities analysis  showed no significant difference between gene-expression analyses performed with fluidigm microfluidics dynamic arrays  and the stratagene mx3005p qpcr system  . the axis  <dig> discriminates bth- treated modalities treated of all other modalities , marked by a significant over expression of sts-pal-lox-glu-chit3-per and chit <dig> genes and significant repression chi -pgip-ldox-f3h-gst and pin genes in these samples. by cons, although variables pr10-ants-chi-acc-chit4-ldox-pr1-chit3-glu and cals genes contribute significantly to the axis  <dig>  no particular modality was significantly correlated with this axe  <dig> . confidence ellipses around the categories of treatments revealed two significant clusters: cluster a with control and fos-treated samples and cluster b only with bth-treated samples.fig.  <dig> principal component analysis and cluster of genes differentially expressed. pca of  <dig> vitis vinifera defense-related gene expression data sets for visualizing observations in a 2-dimensional space in order to identify uniform or atypical groups of observations. a projection on the standard unit circle of the quantitative variables : b the two major principal components explaining ~ 60% of the expression variance plotted for  <dig> samples. gene expression data were obtained by microfluidic dynamic array  or by the stratagene mx3005p system . the different groups are indicated by different colors 




gene expression analyses made on leaves sampled 48 h after downy mildew inoculation  showed that the bth treatment continued to modulate  <dig> % of the studied genes , 87% of them being up-regulated . the significant efficacy of the bth treatment seems to be due to the stimulation of grapevine defenses, although the level of protection it provides is lower than with fos.

on the other hand, the grapevine defense responses to the downy mildew attack in fos-treated plants resulted in a modulation of 71% genes studied and 83% were significantly repressed . these results are consistent with previous studies  <cit> , where the pathogen modulated the plant defenses in its favor, including suppressing the defense genes. at the concentration used , the fos efficiency observed in this trial is probably mostly due to a fungicide effect in view of the low level of defense-related gene expression compared to the untreated control.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we report the development of a new high-throughput q-pcr methodology adapted to monitor grape defense responses. with the stratagene system and the “biomolchem” chip,  <dig> samples were analyzed with  <dig> primer sets  by real-time rt-qpcr. the time to run one plate in this system is 1:30 h. with the biomark hd system, it is possible to obtain  <dig> data  in 4 h. this new flexible method has a throughput 60– <dig> times higher and uses amounts of cdna 70– <dig> times smaller. furthermore, the samples and reagents used are approximately  <dig> times cheaper than with conventional assays.

the “neovigen96” chip allowed us to demonstrate the defense-stimulating effect of bth in the vineyard, leading to a partial but significant protection against downy mildew. with fos, the grapevine protection obtained against downy mildew in the vineyard could not be explained by weak elicitor activity so this suggests that it has a strong fungicide action in our hands.

it is now possible to obtain better and easier understanding of grapevine responses to elicitation in the field. the potential of elicitors can be exploited by combining them in innovative pest management programs in association or in alternation with conventional fungicides in order to reduce the use of fungicides.
