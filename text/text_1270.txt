BACKGROUND
stress is a potent risk factor in the development of mood and anxiety disorders and other psychopathologies. for example, stress is an important non-genetic cause of major depressive disorder , with both acute and chronic forms capable of precipitating major depressive episodes
 <cit> . a number of theories have been proposed to explain how stress alters brain structure and function in stress responsive areas
 <cit>  and there is compelling evidence for synaptic plasticity dysregulation, with much work having elucidated how the glucocorticoid and various neurotransmitter systems contribute to this dysregulation . in order to better understand how stress affects brain function, we have previously used a chronic psychological stress model and found that this stress paradigm markedly upregulates deltafosb expression, a marker of ongoing neuronal activity, in the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex 
 <cit> . the ilmpfc is implicated in processing emotional context and, consistent with this notion, human patients with vmpfc lesions showed impaired social emotions
 <cit> . additionally, deep brain stimulation of the vmpfc region can prolong remission of depression in treatment-resistant patients, indicating a role for this brain region in depressive states
 <cit> . these human data and our previous findings using chronic psychological stress, which is known to increase vulnerability to the development of depression-like symptoms
 <cit> , led us to initially focus on the ilmpfc to better understand the neurobiology of stress and how this might potentially lead to depression sequelae.

to identify as many ilmpfc mechanisms as possible that are involved in the response to repeated stress, we used a genome-wide, gene expression analysis approach. we also chose a restraint stress model as this type of psychological stress affords greater control in application of the stressor than with, for example, the social conflict model. as the neural correlates that underpin the transition to the depressive state are not understood, we tried to identify early stress-induced changes that may increase susceptibility to the development of a full depression-like state. it is known that multiple stress experiences are generally needed to cause mdd in humans and are absolutely required to develop depression-like symptoms in animals, so we used what can be considered a sub-chronic stress paradigm that does not lead to these behavioural symptoms. we found sub-chronic stress resulted in a molecular signature in the ilmpfc, specifically perturbed bdnf-ntrk <dig>  signalling, that is consistent with known indices of the depressive state and that was prevented with fluoxetine treatment.

RESULTS
genome-wide gene expression analysis
illumina ratref- <dig> expression beadchip microarrays and genomestudio software were used for genome-wide screening. as gene expression changes are generally subtle in the brain
 <cit> , a relatively low fold-change cutoff of  <dig>  was used. a statistical significance level of p≤ <dig>  was used after applying a false discovery rate  to correct for multiple testing
 <cit> . using these criteria,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in the ilmpfc from the stress group compared to controls, with  <dig> genes having significantly higher expression levels and  <dig> with significantly lower expression levels . the majority of differentially expressed genes showed a fold change of less than  <dig>  consistent with the notion that brain gene expression changes are generally modest.

pathways associated with stress-induced gene expression change
to better interpret the stress-induced changes in gene expression in the ilmpfc with regard to potential biological function, the list of differentially expressed genes was subjected to pathways analysis using the database for annotation, visualisation and integrated discovery 
 <cit> . david analyzes gene lists to statistically determine whether there is enrichment for genes that belong to a priori defined gene sets. using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  - defined biological pathways, this analysis found enrichment in the list of genes for  <dig> pathways . notably, neurotrophin signalling was the most significantly enriched pathway in the differentially expressed gene list. two other pathways associated with neuroplasticity also had relatively high enrichment scores: long-term potentiation  and erbb signalling. both of these pathways have been implicated in psychiatric disorders
 <cit> .

real-time quantitative pcr  confirmation of stress-induced gene changes
in choosing specific genes for rt-qpcr confirmation, we used one or more of the following criteria: a) presence in enriched gene lists, as determined by david analysis; b) a fold-change in either direction of ≥ <dig> , as determined by microarray analysis; c) experimental evidence in the literature supporting an involvement for the gene of interest in stress-related mechanisms. for instance, microarray and pathway analyses showed a down-regulation of genes encoding for the neurotrophin receptors ntrk <dig>  and ntrk <dig>  and other components of the neurotrophin  signalling pathway such as camk2a , gsk3β  and braf , in the ilmpfc of rats from the stress group. rt-qpcr analysis confirmed that the expression levels of the genes that encode for braf, gsk3β, ntrk <dig> and ntrk <dig> proteins were decreased in the ilmpfc of the stress group, in accordance with microarray results . the decrease in camk2a gene expression, however, was not confirmed by rt-qpcr. in addition, we probed other genes that were not identified by microarray analysis, but that we considered potentially important. rt-qpcr showed that expression of mapk <dig>  mtor and pik3cb genes were all significantly lower in the stressed group compared to controls. the expression level of akt <dig> was not significantly altered by stress.

the effects of fluoxetine on ilmpfc stress-induced gene changes
as we found significant reduction in bdnf signalling-related genes in the stress group and perturbation in this pathway has been implicated in the aetiology of depression, we determined whether treatment with the antidepressant, fluoxetine, would alter the stress-induced changes in ilmpfc bdnf-related gene expression. as shown in figure
 <dig>  fluoxetine treatment modulated the expression levels of genes involved in the neurotrophin signalling pathway. fluoxetine significantly reduced the effect of stress on ntrk <dig>  gsk3β and pik3cb gene expression in the ilmpfc, such that the levels were not significantly different to home cage controls or fluoxetine treated controls. in contrast, fluoxetine did not alter the effects of stress on the expression of ntrk <dig>  mtor, mapk <dig>  and braf genes. fluoxetine administration alone  also caused a significant decrease in expression levels of ntrk <dig> and mtor when compared to controls without antidepressant or stress . fluoxetine, and fluoxetine plus stress, caused significant and similar increases in camk2a mrna relative to controls and stress.

discussion
stress is a potent risk factor for the development of depression, but the mechanisms that progress the brain’s normal response to stress to the pathological state that manifests as depression are poorly understood. here, we have focussed on the ilmpfc to characterise gene expression changes following repeated, but sub-chronic, episodes of stress. we based our study design on the premise that early neurobiological indices of depression, or at least of the transition into a depression-like state, may be detectable in a sub-chronic model and we chose the pfc because of its known sensitivity to stress and its putative involvement in depression. for instance, stress causes dendritic remodelling in rat il
 <cit>  and other mpfc regions
 <cit> , synaptic plasticity impairment
 <cit> , and deficits in pfc-mediated behaviours
 <cit> . consistent with these preclinical findings, mdd sufferers have reduced neuronal size
 <cit> , grey matter volume
 <cit> , and activity
 <cit>  in the subgenual pfc, the neuroanatomical equivalent of the rodent ilmpfc.

to observe depression-like behavioural and other changes in animals, it is necessary for the animal to experience repeated exposure to the stressor over prolonged periods. for example, in a systematic study of the effects of stress episode duration and number of repeats, kim and han demonstrated that at least  <dig> days of  <dig> hour daily restraint stress were required to produce significant depression-like behaviours
 <cit> . consistent with this finding, mclaughlin and co-workers found restraint stress of  <dig> hours per day for  <dig> days was required to induce morphological and functional changes in another brain region affected in depression, the hippocampus
 <cit> . in a social interaction model, at least  <dig> consecutive days of social defeat appear necessary for depression-like symptomology to appear, at least in a subset of “susceptible” animals
 <cit> . similarly, multiple repeats of stress episodes are also necessary in the chronic mild stress model of depression
 <cit> . it should be noted that single episodes of stress can elicit behavioural changes, however, these are considered characteristic of anxiety per se, rather than depression
 <cit> . with respect to anxiety, we cannot completely discount the possibility that our sub-chronic stress-induced molecular changes are also related to anxiety. the link between stress and anxiety is well-established and there is considerable overlap in the putative mechanisms and behaviours between anxiety and depression. furthermore, some antidepressants also have anxiolytic properties. regarding this possibility, there is conflicting evidence in the literature. it is known that a single restraint episode, for example, can result in the delayed appearance of anxiety-like behaviour
 <cit> , and kim and han  demonstrated that animals subjected to a more chronic restraint stress paradigm  did not display anxiety related behaviours as assessed with the elevated plus maze
 <cit> . one explanation is that acute stress episodes are more likely to induce anxiety like behaviours and as the stress becomes more chronic there is a transition to a more depression-like behavioural phenotype. however, others have shown that anxiety-like behaviours can be displayed, in addition to depression-like ones, after many weeks of chronic restraint stress
 <cit> . clearly, more work needs to be done to understand the relationship between the nature of stress  and the development of anxiety and depression. a potential limitation of the present study concerns the lack of a single acute stress group for comparison with the control and sub-chronic groups. notionally, this type of acute stressor might have caused a similar molecular profile. however, we consider this possibility to be extremely unlikely given that bland et al.  used a single  <dig> minute session of electric shock, a stressor that is far more intense than our restraint stress, and found the stressed induced changes in neurotrophin transcripts in all regions of the mpfc, including ilmpfc, had returned to baseline by  <dig> hours post-stress
 <cit> .

to identify stress-related mechanisms that may potentially lead to the development of pathology, we first carried out a genome-wide gene expression analysis using moderately stringent criteria to define differentially expressed genes. a number of previous studies have also taken this approach
 <cit> , but direct gene-by-gene comparisons with these studies is problematic due to the different stress paradigms and microarray platforms used, as well as variation in brain region taken for analysis. indeed, surget and colleagues showed remarkably little overlap  in gene expression between the cingulate cortex, amygdala and dentate gyrus of chronically stressed animals
 <cit> . with regard the pattern of gene expression, we found the vast majority of differentially expressed genes were down-regulated, with most of the up-regulated transcripts being predicted genes or pseudogenes. down regulation of a majority of genes in the pfc has also been observed following chronic stress
 <cit> . to improve interpretability of the microarray data in relation to gene function in biological processes, we carried out pathway analysis whereby the degree to which sets of genes belonging to a priori determined biological pathways were enriched in the differentially expressed gene list was assessed using david
 <cit> . we identified eight significantly enriched pathways , three had fdrs less than 10% and we focussed on these. notably, all three of these pathways have been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders
 <cit> .

the most significantly enriched pathway, and the one with the lowest fdr, was for neurotrophin signalling. there is a substantial body of evidence implicating bdnf in mdd. for example, bdnf and ntrk <dig> transcripts and protein levels were markedly reduced in the pfc and amygdala of mdd subjects
 <cit> . also, serum bdnf is lower in mdd sufferers
 <cit>  and bdnf is being considered a predictive diagnostic marker for mdd
 <cit> . additionally, a number of chronic stress-based animal models of mdd have shown perturbation in the bdnf-ntrk <dig> signalling pathway in various brain regions
 <cit> . indeed, nestler and colleagues have demonstrated a crucial role for bdnf in the mesolimbic system for the development of depression-like behaviour
 <cit> . we did not find stress-induced change in bdnf transcript levels in ilmpfc, which may imply that bdnf protein levels are also unchanged. this raises the question as to why ntrk <dig> levels should change if bdnf does not. one possibility is that bdnf protein is delivered by dopaminergic afferents
 <cit>  to the ilmpfc and, consistent with this notion, we have found increased bdnf transcript levels in vta dopamine neurons . alteration in the bdnf pathway can also be observed in some acute stress models, however as mentioned above, these changes are typically short-lived
 <cit> . our altered bdnf-ntrk <dig> pathway finding was evident at  <dig> hours post the last stress episode of the sub-chronic stress paradigm and is consistent with a molecular signature of depression. the sub-chronic stress paradigm used in the present study does not induce depression-like behaviours, therefore, this molecular finding may represent an early mechanistic indicator of depression neuropathology. prevention of the sub-chronic stress-induced bdnf-ntrk <dig> perturbation by the antidepressant, fluoxetine, is consistent with this notion. furthermore, it may also indicate that the ilmpfc is a particularly sensitive region to stress and therefore important in the development of the depressive state.

bdnf  binding to ntrk <dig> can activate three main intracellular signalling cascades: mitogen-associated protein kinase , phosphotidylinositol- <dig> kinase  - akt, and the phospholipase c-γ <dig>  cascades
 <cit> . as ntrk <dig> is the post-synaptic entry point to the bdnf/ntrk <dig> signalling cascade, reduced ntrk <dig> levels might be expected to affect each of these intracellular signalling cascades and have significant impact on diverse cell functions. indeed, genetically reduced bdnf/ntrk <dig> levels result in altered activity-dependent synaptogenesis
 <cit> , synaptic function, such as ltp
 <cit> , learning
 <cit>  and, importantly, stress-related behaviours
 <cit> . our rt-qpcr data indicate that sub-chronic stress induced reduction in ntrk <dig> transcript levels may in fact not impact each of these signalling pathways. for example, both the pi3k-akt  and mapk/erk  pathways were affected by sub-chronic stress, but the plcγ <dig>  was spared. one important downstream target of the pi3k-akt and mapk/erk pathways is the mammalian target of rapamycin , a kinase involved in many cellular processes
 <cit> , including translation of synaptic proteins that underpin plasticity
 <cit> , and, therefore, potentially important in the development of the depressive state
 <cit> . although mtor was not identified as being differentially expressed by microarray, using rt-qpcr we found it to be significantly reduced, consistent with changes in the aforementioned upstream regulatory pathways. this is supportive for a potential role in maladaptive neuronal plasticity contributing to the depressive state, although this will obviously require further experimental elucidation, particularly at the protein level.

interestingly, antidepressant treatment with fluoxetine only prevented the sub-chronic stress-induced changes in the pi3k-akt pathway related transcripts , with b-raf and mapk <dig> gene transcripts of the mapk/erk pathway not significantly different to the stress without fluoxetine levels. this may indicate that the effects of fluoxetine antidepressant treatment are preferentially mediated by the pi3k-akt pathway, at least in this brain region, and suggest that targeting components of this pathway may be of future therapeutic interest. in this regard it is notable that gsk3b has been implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders
 <cit> . for example, gsk3b is one target for the mood-stabilising drug lithium, it is also required for the antidepressant effects of ketamine
 <cit> , and in mdd sufferers, gsk3b kinase activity is increased in the pfc
 <cit> . consistent with a role for gsk3b in depression, fluoxetine increases phosphorylation of gsk3b at a specific n-terminal serine residue, thereby decreasing the kinase’s activity
 <cit> . conversely, increasing gsk3b activity through viral-mediated overexpression, induces a depression-like phenotype in an animal model
 <cit> . how a reduction in gsk3b at the transcript level, as seen in the present study, fits into this scheme is not clear. interestingly though, and consistent with our data, gsk3b gene expression but not protein levels, was reduced in the nucleus accumbens of depression-susceptible animals in a chronic social defeat model of depression
 <cit> . this similarity between our gsk3b finding and that of wilkinson et al., 2011
 <cit> , further supports our contention that we are seeing an early molecular signature of depression in the sub-chronic stress model. it should also be noted that gsk3b is not limited to the bdnf/ntrk <dig> pathway as it is an important component of the wnt-frizzled signalling cascade, as well as being a downstream target of pka, pkc and akt
 <cit> , all of which are components of multiple signalling cascades. the wnt-frizzled signalling pathway has recently been implicated in depression
 <cit> .

we also found sub-chronic stress reduced ilmpfc transcript levels for ntrk <dig>  the cognate receptor for the neurotrophin, nt- <dig>  like bdnf, nt- <dig> has also been implicated in mdd. for instance, nt- <dig> gene expression was reduced in peripheral blood cells of individuals during depressive but not remissive states
 <cit>  and ntrk <dig> transcript and protein levels were reduced in some brain regions of mdd patients
 <cit>  as were nt- <dig> levels
 <cit> . surprisingly, we found fluoxetine alone also reduced the expression of ntrk <dig>  previously, it was shown that ssri treatment had no effect on csf nt- <dig> protein levels in mdd
 <cit>  and transcript levels in rat hippocampus
 <cit> . the ntrk <dig> transcript reduction seen in the present study may reflect a similar mechanism to that causing ntrk <dig> reduction. why this particular receptor was affected by fluoxetine remains to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
to further elucidate potential neurobiological mechanisms that may increase depression susceptibility, we have used a sub-chronic stress paradigm that is not capable of inducing behaviours that are characteristic of depression, and evaluated the infralimbic prefrontal cortex for molecular indices that may constitute an early signature for this psychopathology. we found that the bdnf-ntrk <dig> pathway was affected by the stress paradigm as was gsk3b, which is a component of both the neurotrophin as well as the wnt signalling cascades. both the ntrk <dig> and wnt signalling pathways are implicated in depression and, consistent with the notion that our molecular findings represent early depression neuropathology, the stress-induced perturbations in these pathways were prevented by pretreatment with an antidepressant, fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. these findings indicate that brain signalling pathways that are known to be abnormal in fully developed depressive states are actually perturbed well before the manifestation of behaviours that characterise depression.
