BACKGROUND
differentiation of f <dig> embryonal carcinoma  cells into parietal endoderm  is accompanied by dramatic changes in gene expression. amongst these are a marked decrease in transcription of trna and 5s rrna genes by pol iii, which reflects a reduced requirement for biosynthesis as the differentiating cells stop growing and dividing  <cit> . biochemical reconstitution experiments suggested that this change is caused by a specific decrease in activity of the essential pol iii transcription factor tfiiib  <cit> . in support of this, western blot analysis revealed that pe cells express markedly reduced levels of brf <dig>  a subunit of tfiiib that binds pol iii and brings it to its targets genes  <cit> . f <dig> cell differentiation also involves a decrease in the level of the tata-binding protein tbp, which is another essential subunit of tfiiib  <cit> . however, the conclusion that pol iii transcription is regulated under these circumstances through changes in tfiiib proved to be controversial. meissner and colleagues argued that tfiiib activity is unchanged during differentiation and that transcriptional control reflects other mechanisms  <cit> . they subsequently implcated bdp <dig>  a third essential subunit of tfiiib  <cit> . here we compare directly the behaviour of the tfiiib components brf <dig>  tbp and bdp <dig>  which had not been done in any of the previous studies. we confirm that each is down-regulated when f <dig> cells differentiate. whereas tbp is subject to post-transcriptional control, the fall in brf <dig> and bdp <dig> levels reflects changes in the corresponding mrnas. we show that transcriptional repression occurs even if brf <dig> expression is maintained in pe cells. we also document changes to several regulators that are known to act directly on tfiiib.

RESULTS
raising brf <dig> expression in f <dig> cells does not stimulate trna expression or proliferation
to test the role of brf <dig> levels in dictating pol iii output during differentiation, we examined whether it is possible to construct an f <dig> cell derivative in which brf <dig> expression is maintained in pe cells. to this end, a pcdna <dig> expression vector containing human brf <dig> cdna was introduced by stable transfection to create a cell line that we refer to as brf <dig> f <dig>  since this cdna is transcribed from a constitutive cmv promoter, it should not be subject to the same regulatory influences that act on the endogenous gene. indeed, rt-pcr analysis confirmed that expression from the cmv promoter is undiminished following differentiation . quantitation of western blots revealed that the total level of brf <dig> in undifferentiated cells was raised by approximately four-fold in brf <dig> f <dig> cells, relative to untransfected cells or control cells, referred to as vec.f <dig>  that carry empty pcdna <dig> vector .

an increase in brf <dig> expression was found to stimulate proliferation of immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts , imr <dig> human diploid fibroblasts and cho cells  <cit> . however, the brf <dig> f <dig> cells proliferate at the same rate as matched vec.f <dig> control cells, both before and after differentiation . in the case of mefs, the proliferative response to brf <dig> elevation can be mimicked by overexpressing a key brf <dig> target, the trnaimet that is required for translation initiation  <cit> . whereas trnaimet levels increase in response to brf <dig> induction in mefs  <cit> , brf <dig> f <dig> cells express no more trnaimet than vec.f <dig> control cells, after expression was normalised to the mrna encoding acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein p <dig>  . as positive control, we confirmed that brf <dig> mrna is elevated in the brf <dig> f <dig> cells. another trna that can be induced in a variety of cell types by raising brf <dig> levels is trnaleu  <cit> . nevertheless, as with trnaimet, comparable levels of trnaleu are detected in brf <dig> f <dig> and vec.f <dig> cells. although we have only tested two examples, these data suggest that brf <dig> is not limiting for trna expression in f <dig> cells. this contrasts with mefs, hela, rat1a and cho cells  <cit> . clearly, a failure to raise expression of key genes offers a ready explanation for the lack of a proliferative response.

constant brf <dig> expression does not prevent pol iii transcription from decreasing when f <dig> cells differentiate
although apparently not limiting, the exogenous brf <dig> in our cell lines allowed us to determine if down-regulation of pol iii transcription during f <dig> cell differentiation is dependent on the decrease in brf <dig> expression that normally accompanies this transition  <cit> . to facilitate detection, a ha tag was included at the n-terminus of the exogenous brf <dig> in brf <dig> f <dig> cells. immunoblotting with antibody against this tag detected not only ha-brf <dig>  but also a smaller protein of unknown identity, that appears during differentiation; this protein is not derived from the vector, as it is also detected in untransfected cells . nevertheless, it is clear that ha-brf <dig> levels are maintained in the brf <dig> f <dig> cells after differentiation into pe . despite this, trna gene transcriptional activity was decreased by ~10-fold in extracts of fully differentiated brf <dig> f <dig> cells that continued to express the exogenous ha-brf <dig> . this change is not significantly different from the decrease seen in untransfected f <dig> cells . these data suggest that additional changes to the pol iii machinery also occur when f <dig> cells differentiate.

f <dig> cell differentiation is accompanied by specific changes in expression of all three tfiiib subunits
western blot analysis demonstrated that not only brf <dig>  but also tbp and bdp <dig> protein levels are markedly lower in pe cell extracts relative to undifferentiated ec cell extracts . in contrast to these decreases in the three tfiiib subunits, the pe samples show a large increase in expression of laminin b <dig>  an established marker of differentiation . these changes are specific, since levels of actin and tfiiic <dig>  remain relatively constant when the ec and pe cell extracts are compared.

the fact that ha-brf <dig> protein is expressed at unchanged levels in pe cells indicates that the observed decrease in endogenous brf <dig> is unlikely to be caused by differential translation or stability. instead, it suggests that transcription of the endogenous brf <dig> gene may be regulated, a mechanism evaded by the cmv promoter that we used to express ha-brf <dig>  this hypothesis was supported by rt-pcr analysis, which showed that levels of endogenous brf <dig> mrna are lower following differentiation . quantification of four experiments revealed that brf <dig> is expressed in pe cells at ~62% of the level observed in undifferentiated ec cells, after normalization to arpp p <dig> mrna. similarly, the level of bdp <dig> mrna in pe cells is ~46% of that in ec cells, on average. in contrast, tbp mrna levels are ~72% higher in pe cells relative to ec cells. we conclude that brf <dig> and bdp <dig> expression is regulated at the mrna level in differentiating f <dig> cells. the decrease in brf <dig> mrna expression seen by rt-pcr is less than the decrease seen in brf <dig> protein by western immunoblotting. this apparent discrepancy might be explained if brf <dig> protein levels respond in a non-linear fashion to the modest decrease in mrna. in contrast to brf <dig> and bdp <dig>  levels of tbp protein are dictated through post-transcriptional control, as shown by perletti et al., who demonstrated the selective proteolysis of tbp when f <dig> cells differentiate  <cit> .

both activators and repressors of tfiiib are regulated during f <dig> cell differentiation
the activity of tfiiib in mammals is subject to regulation by a variety of accessory proteins with which it is stably associated  <cit> . these include p <dig> and the rb family, which inhibit tfiiib, as well as c-myc and erk, which activate tfiiib. since each of these regulators can have a profound influence on tfiiib function, we investigated whether they are also affected by f <dig> cell differentiation.

several groups have shown independently that rb can bind and repress tfiiib  <cit> . the interaction is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases  <cit> . it results in transcriptional repression, because rb compromises the ability of tfiiib to bind to pol iii and tfiiic  <cit> . western blotting revealed a substantial increase in rb expression in pe cells . tfiiib is also bound and inhibited by the rb-related pocket proteins p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> , but the levels of these change little between ec and pe cells . we also detected minimal change in p <dig> abundance during f <dig> cell differentiation . changes in the post-translational modification state of p <dig> remain a possibility, but we have not investigated these, as it is currently unknown how they may influence the ability of p <dig> to regulate tfiiib.

pol iii transcription can be stimulated by the proto-oncogene product c-myc  <cit> . recruitment of tfiiib to target genes is facilitated by c-myc, an effect that involves the cofactor gcn <dig> and localised acetylation of histone h <dig>  <cit> . we found that expression of c-myc decreases dramatically when f <dig> cells differentiate , as previously reported  <cit> . in contrast, little or no change was detected in expression of max, the dimerisation partner of c-myc. a second potent activator of tfiiib is the map kinase erk, which binds and phosphorylates brf <dig>  <cit> . although the total concentration of erk protein is relatively constant, its active phosphorylated form is much less prevalent in pe cells . thus, the tfiiib remaining in these differentiated cells is likely to be deprived of two key regulators that are required for its full activity.

discussion
experiments with crude phosphocellulose fractions provided the first indication that pol iii transcription is down-regulated during f <dig> cell differentiation through inactivation of tfiiib  <cit> . at the time, the composition of tfiiib had not been determined and so molecular reagents were unavailable. the possibility therefore remained that the biochemical activity assays were in fact responding to some alternative factor, present in the same crude fractions. once the subunits of tfiiib were identified, regulatory studies could be conducted with a great deal more certainty. the use of specific antibodies allowed demonstration that differentiation of f <dig> cells is accompanied by a marked decrease in the levels of tbp and brf <dig>  <cit> . this down-regulation of tbp has also been reported independently  <cit> . nevertheless, another study suggested that although tfiiib may become limiting and contribute to the down-regulation of transcription, it cannot account for it  <cit> . the authors proposed that the key regulatory event that dictates pol iii output during differentiation is loss of an activity that they referred to as tfiiic <dig>  <cit> . however, their subsequent analysis revealed that bdp <dig> was present in the tfiiic <dig> fractions and required for their activity  <cit> . indeed, recombinant bdp <dig> could substitute for the tfiiic <dig> fractions in reconstituting transcription  <cit> . western blotting showed a decrease in bdp <dig> expression in differentiated f <dig> cells  <cit> , a result that we have confirmed here with an alternative antibody and by rt-pcr. both groups' data therefore support the original model that down-regulation of tfiiib is responsible for the substantial decrease in pol iii transcription that occurs when f <dig> cells differentiate. given that the model was based on the use of extremely crude fractions, it is perhaps surprising that it has turned out to be correct.

for most pol iii-transcribed genes, including those encoding trna and 5s rrna, the essential components of tfiiib are tbp, bdp <dig> and brf <dig>  <cit> . however, a subset of pol iii-dependent genes use a form of tfiiib in which brf <dig> is replaced by its homologue brf2; these all have upstream  promoters and include the genes encoding u <dig>  7sk and y rnas. we have not investigated brf <dig> in this study.

specific changes in expression of tbp- associated factors during differentiation are a feature of other transcription systems besides pol iii. for example, levels of tafi <dig> and tafi <dig> decrease when f <dig> cells differentiate, causing a fall in pol i transcription  <cit> . the same pair of pol i-specific tafs are down-regulated during differentiation of b cells into plasma cells  <cit> . these tafs are part of the sl <dig> complex, which is also inactivated when u <dig> promyelocytic cells differentiate  <cit> . however, the loss of sl <dig> activity in u <dig> cells is not due to changes in the abundance of its constituent tafs or tbp  <cit> . the molecular basis of this has not been established, but might reflect loss of c-myc, which has been shown to bind and activate sl <dig>  <cit> . down-regulated expression of some pol ii-specific tafs has also been observed during differentiation of f <dig> cells and c2c <dig> myoblasts  <cit> . changes in taf levels seem therefore to be used in various systems to re-programme gene transcription as cells differentiate.

expression of the bdp <dig> gene is very sensitive to tbp levels, whereas the brf <dig> gene is less responsive  <cit> . the decreased bdp <dig> mrna in f <dig> pe cells may therefore be a consequence of tbp down-regulation. in contrast, an erk inhibitor suppresses expression of brf <dig>  but not bdp <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, brf <dig> expression is stimulated by c-myc  <cit> . it is therefore possible that the decrease in brf <dig> levels following f <dig> cell differentiation is caused by the observed regulation of c-myc and/or erk. as tbp is down-regulated by selective proteolysis in differentiating f <dig> cells  <cit> , we wondered if the same applies to brf <dig>  however, our data argue strongly against this, since brf <dig> protein levels are maintained when the gene is expressed from a constitutive promoter. regulated proteolytic turnover has not been excluded for bdp <dig>  but the decrease detected in its mrna may be sufficient to account for the down-regulation of this taf.

the fact that forced expression of brf <dig> does not restore transcription in pe cells does not mean that brf <dig> control is irrelevant in this system. we interpret it as being a reflection of regulatory redundancy, where more than one control mechanism can be sufficient to achieve a phenotypic end point. indeed, we do not believe that pol iii transcription could be restored by reversing any one of the changes that we have documented. although we have only tested this directly in the case of brf <dig>  we do not feel it is worth attempting further, as the prospects of success seem remote. restoring tbp or bdp <dig> levels in pe cells is unlikely to have much impact if brf <dig> levels become limiting. co-expressing all three subunits would be difficult to achieve and still would be unlikely to be effective, given the high levels of rb, which is known to bind and repress tfiiib  <cit> . depletion of c-myc is sufficient to inhibit pol iii transcription  <cit> . if c-myc were introduced into pe cells, its activity would be counteracted by max-binding repressor proteins, which are induced during differentiation  <cit> . furthermore, erk inhibition is sufficient to suppress pol iii transcription  <cit>  and would not be reversed by overexpressing this kinase, as its inactivation in pe cells reflects its dephosphorylation, rather than loss of erk itself. these considerations have convinced us that attempts to restore tfiiib activity in pe cells are unlikely to be successful.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, differentiation of f <dig> ec cells is accompanied by several specific and drastic changes to tfiiib and its associated regulators . the abundance of tbp, brf <dig> and bdp <dig> decreases markedly. this reflects a fall in the expression of mrnas encoding brf <dig> and bdp <dig>  whereas tbp is regulated post-transcriptionally. the tfiiib remaining in pe cells is deprived of c-myc and active erk, both of which are important for its optimal function. in addition, it must contend with highly-elevated levels of its inhibitor rb. these combined changes are more than sufficient to explain the low rates of pol iii transcription that are a feature of this differentiated cell type.
