BACKGROUND
several evidences indicate that a viral infection could be involved in the aetiology of demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis   <cit> . several members of the herpesviridae family, including herpes simplex virus type  <dig> , have been suggested as possible causes of this pathology  <cit> . oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing glial cells in the central nervous system, have proven to be susceptible to this alphaherpesvirus in vivo <cit>  and in cultured cells  <cit> . therefore, to deepen the knowledge on hsv- <dig> infection of myelinating cells, will contribute in clarifying relevant aspects of demyelination aetiology.

hsv- <dig> is a highly prevalent neurotropic human pathogen that can infect and establish latency in neurons. hsv- <dig> can cause, in certain circumstances, severe pathologies such as keratoconjunctivitis and encephalitis. following primary infection of epithelial cells, virions spread to neurons and establish latent infections in the trigeminal ganglia. the morphogenesis of hsv- <dig> has been broadly studied  <cit> , but several events of this complex process remain unsolved. viral transcription, replication, packaging of the new viral particles and formation of nucleocapsids all take place in the nucleus of the infected cell. thereafter, dna-containing capsids acquire a primary envelope when they enter the perinuclear space by budding into the inner nuclear membrane, followed by a subsequent de-envelopment process through the outer nuclear membrane  <cit> . once in the cytoplasm, the nucleocapsids acquire their inner tegument  <cit> . finally, virion assembly concludes through a secondary envelopment process by budding into trans-golgi network -derived vesicles coated with viral glycoproteins and more tegument proteins  <cit> . during this process, virions acquire the outer tegument and the envelope. although this model of envelopment/de-envelopment/re-envelopment is widely accepted  <cit> , many aspects of the process remain to be unravelled, specifically those concerning the molecular tools that hsv- <dig> uses to exploit the cellular trafficking machinery.

small gtpase rab <dig>  <cit>  subfamily consists –in vertebrates– of two isoforms, rab27a and rab27b, which display a high homology. both isoforms, although differing in cell type specificity, have been implicated in regulated exocytosis and might play a key role in certain events of membrane trafficking. rab27a and rab27b are functionally redundant but display differential expression in tissues: while rab27a is mainly expressed in a broad range of secretory cells  <cit> , melanocytes, endocrine cells and cytotoxic t lymphocytes , rab27b is expressed in platelets, endocrine cells, spleen and brain, being absent in melanocytes and ctls  <cit> . hence, rab27a and rab27b show different expression patterns, especially in brain, although both proteins are expressed in pituitary cells  <cit> . a recent work showed that downregulation of rab27a blocked lysosomal exocytosis in schwann cells and reduced the remyelination of regenerated sciatic nerve, suggesting an important role for rab27a in remyelination within the peripheral nervous system  <cit> . in addition, a role for rab <dig> isoforms in exosome secretion has also been demonstrated  <cit> . rab27a was the first example of a rab protein implicated in a human genetic disease: griscelli syndrome type  <dig> , a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the rab27a gene  <cit> . clinical features of this syndrome include partial albinism and immune disorder. the ashen mouse is the corresponding murine model  <cit> . in accordance with the location of secretory granules, rab27a is polarized towards the apical domain of epithelial cells  <cit> .

rab27a regulates secretion of lysosome-related organelles , a heterogeneous group of organelles which share features with multivesicular bodies /lysosomes. nevertheless, although lros share various features with late endosomes/lysosomes, they differ in function, morphology, and composition. these organelles include, among others, melanosomes in melanocytes, lytic granules in ctls, dense granules in platelets, azurophilic granules in neutrophils and eosinophils and weibel-palade bodies  in endothelial cells  <cit> . although all these cellular compartments share several characteristics, lros and classic secretory granules differ in the source of their membrane and lumenal contents: most of lros content derives from the endosomal system, whereas secretory granules derive directly from the tgn. however, it is now accepted that lros comprise a very heterogeneous group of organelles that seem to have diverse origins  <cit> .

several rab gtpases have been involved in the morphogenesis of herpesviruses. in particular, recent works have revealed the role for rab1a/b, rab3a and rab <dig> in hsv- <dig> envelopment  <cit> . other rab proteins, such as rab <dig> and rab27a, have also been involved in hcmv –a member of the betaherpesvirinae subfamily– assembly  <cit> . given the similarities in the assembly processes amongst several members of the herpesviridae <cit> , we investigated the role of rab27a in hsv- <dig> morphogenesis. we show that this small gtpase colocalizes in the tgn with the viral glycoproteins gh and gd, together with a pul46-green fluorescent protein -tagged hsv- <dig> . moreover, rab27a depletion decreases the infection rate. taken together, these data point to a significant role for rab27a in the infection of oligodendrocytic cells with hsv- <dig> 

RESULTS
expression of rab27a in hog cells
several reports have previously shown rab27a expression on many different cell types. however, to date, no study addressed rab27a expression in oligodendrocytic cultures. for this purpose, the expression of this gtpase in the human hog oligodendroglial model was investigated using rtqpcr, immunoblot analysis and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy.

immunoblot assays showed the expression of rab27a in hog cells. the epstein barr virus-transformed, human lymphoblastoid hom- <dig> cells and the human melanoma mewo cell line, which are known to express high levels of rab27a  <cit> , were used as positive controls. when compared with these two cell lines, hog cells displayed a significant level of expression . to further determine whether rab27a expression was modified following cell differentiation, we first investigated the expression of rab27a mrna by rt-qpcr in cells cultured either in growth  or differentiation medium . in previous works, we have established the differentiation stage of hog cell line under different conditions, showing that culturing cells for  <dig> hours in dm is sufficient to induce an increment in plp expression and an enrichment of this protein in myelin-like sheets  <cit>  immunoblot assays showed a moderate increase of rab27a in dm cultures . quantitative rt-pcr confirmed an approximate 10% increment of rab27a expression in hog cells cultured under differentiation conditions in comparison to gm cultured cells .


to perform microscopy analysis, hog cells cultured in dm were fixed and processed for confocal immunofluorescence analysis with an anti-rab27a polyclonal antibody. an increase in rab27a in differentiated compared to undifferentiated cells was also found. rab27a was mostly detected in a region probably corresponding to the pericentrosomal area, although it was also detected in scattered cytoplasmic small vesicles . more rab27a-positive scattered vesicles were found in the cytoplasm of cells cultured in gm, although their location was also mainly pericentrosomal. despite this observation, the pattern of of rab27a distribution in cells cultured in dm was quite similar to that observed in cells cultured in gm. for this reason, we decided to show the results obtained only in differentiated cells, essentially analogous to the ones obtained with gm cultures.

subcellular localization of rab27a
to study the subcellular localization of rab27a in hog cells, we performed further immunofluorescence analysis. to this aim, hog cells cultured in dm were fixed and processed for confocal double-labeled indirect immunofluorescence analysis with primary antibodies. first of all, we tested lysosomal markers lamp- <dig> and cd <dig>  to assess the plausible colocalization of these proteins with rab27a. however, in our hands, no colocalization was observed . other markers, such as cd <dig> and tgn <dig>  were tested as well. among all of them, tgn <dig> seemed to be the only one displaying colocalization with rab27a  .


expression and localization of rab27a in hsv- <dig> -infected cells
as a first approximation to assess the feasible relationship between rab27a and hsv- <dig>  hog cells cultured in dm were infected at a m.o.i of  <dig> with two gfp-tagged hsv- <dig>  ghsv-ul <dig> and k26gfp. subsequently, after infection, mrna levels and location were determined by rtqpcr and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy analysis, respectively. immunofluorescence microscopy analyses were carried out within  <dig> h p.i. rtqpcr analysis did not show significant changes in rab27a expression within  <dig> h p.i. .

comparative analysis between ghsv-ul <dig> and k26gfp infection showed that, unlike capsid-tagged k26gfp virus , tegument-tagged ghsv-ul <dig> displayed partial colocalization with rab27a  . absence of colocalization with capsids could be explained by the rapid transport of capsids at the tgn. other studies have also shown that the relatively short life cycle of hsv- <dig> makes it difficult to analyze the vectorial movement of this virus during its rapid egress  <cit> .


in this regard, it is widely accepted that hsv- <dig> acquires tegument and envelope through a process of secondary envelopment by budding into tgn-derived vesicles coated with viral glycoproteins and tegument proteins. since we found a significant colocalization between rab27a and tgn, we carried out confocal triple-labeled indirect immunofluorescence analysis with anti-rab27a and tgn <dig> antibodies, and ghsv-ul <dig> virus. figure  <dig> shows partial colocalization between ghsv-ul <dig>  rab27a and tgn- <dig> .


it has been shown that hsv- <dig> glycoproteins accumulate in the tgn and in tgn-derived vesicles  <cit> . since we suspected a feasible role for rab27a in viral morphogenesis, the next step was to assess whether rab27a colocalized with viral glycoproteins. to this end, we performed confocal triple-labeled indirect immunofluorescence analysis with anti-rab27a, anti-gh lp <dig>  <cit>  and anti-gd lp <dig>  <cit>  antibodies. as expected, both gh  and gd colocalized with rab27a  . finally, triple-labeled indirect immunofluorescence analysis with antibodies anti-rab27a, anti-gd lp <dig> and anti-tgn <dig> demonstrated that colocalization of this viral glycoprotein with rab27a took place in the tgn  .


effect of rab27a depletion in hsv- <dig> infection
further analysis of the role of rab27a during hsv- <dig> infection, was carried out by shrna knockdown. to generate stably silenced cell lines, hog cultures were transfected with two plasmids expressing rab27a shrnas. one of them, named shrna- <dig>  induced an efficient knockdown of rab27a while, in comparison, a second one, shrna- <dig>  elicited a weaker effect .


once our cellular model was established, susceptibility to hsv- <dig> infection was assessed by plaque assay and immunoblot analysis. in addition, viral entry was also investigated using a recombinant hsv- <dig>  which expresses β-galactosidase upon entry into cells. in rab27a-silenced cells, an important decrease in viral-associated gfp signal was observed  <dig> h p.i. . plaque assay showed a drastic reduction in plaque size of silenced shrna- <dig> cells compared to control cells . moreover, the number of plaques also decreased, suggesting that rab27a depletion could be affecting the viral egress. moreover, cells were infected at a m.o.i. of  <dig> with k26gfp and then, processed for fluorescence activated cell sorter  analysis. the number of gfp-expressing cells and their mean fluorescence were measured  <dig> hour after infection. as shown in figure 7d, a significant decrease in these parameters was confirmed in rab27a-silenced cells compared with non-target control shrna-expressing and non-transfected cells. histogram data have been expressed as percentage of maximum , in which y axis corresponds to the number of cells for each fluorescence intensity of the x axis, relative to the peak fraction of cells. to assess whether rab27a is involved in the viral cycle, we measured viral yield of infected cells. viral titer of rab27a-silenced infected cells also showed, within  <dig> h p.i., a significant decrease compared with non-target control shrna-expressing and non-transfected cells . this effect is not due to a differential entry capacity of virions into the cell, since kinetics of viral entry showed no difference among silenced and control cultures . altogether, these results suggest that rab27a might be required not only in viral egress, but also in viral production.

discussion
many details on the molecular mechanism utilized by hsv- <dig> to exploit the cellular trafficking machinery during morphogenesis are uncertain. in particular, several aspects regarding the process of the secondary envelopment and viral egress need further enlightenment. final steps of viral assembly take place through secondary envelopment by budding into tgn-derived vesicles coated with viral glycoproteins and tegument proteins  <cit> . herein, we suggest the involvement of the rab-gtpase rab27a in this process.

various rab gtpases have been involved in hsv- <dig> –as well as in other herpesviruses– envelopment  <cit> . in fact, rab27a is required for assembly of hcmv  <cit> . given the similarities among members of the herpesvirus family  <cit> , we decided to analyze whether rab27a plays any influential role in hsv- <dig> infection of oligodendrocytic cells.

first of all, our results showed a significant level of expression of rab27a in hog cells, compared to hom- <dig> and mewo cell lines, which were used as positive controls. although we found a slight increase of rab27a expression after culturing cells under differentiation conditions, results obtained in both systems  did not differ substantially. therefore, we decided to present only the results corresponding to differentiated cells, that is, cells cultured with dm.

to study the subcellular localization of rab27a in our oligodendrocytic system, we performed confocal immunofluorescence microscopy analysis. for this purpose, and taken into account previous studies, we considered the analysis of lysosomal markers lamp- <dig> and cd <dig>  to check whether colocalization of these markers with rab27a actually occurred. however, and contrary to previous findings  <cit> , no colocalization could be observed. interestingly, further experiments showed colocalization between rab27a and tgn <dig> 

thus, in hog oligodendroglial cells, rab27a expression was mostly detected in a region surrounding what seems to be the pericentrosomal area displaying a positive signal for the tgn marker, tgn- <dig>  to depict thoroughly the identity and features of the rab27a-positive structure found in our model, further studies will have to be undertaken. however, given its lysosomal features, it was expectable to find a certain degree of colocalization between rab27a and the late endosomal/lysosomal proteins lamp <dig> and cd <dig>  as it has been described in other systems.

several previous findings may explain the absence of lamp- <dig> and cd <dig> in rab27a-positive structures and the colocalization of rab27a with tgn- <dig>  lros comprise a heterogeneous group of organelles that share various features with late endosomes/lysosomes, but differ in function, morphology, and composition. the existence of a high variety of apparently related organelles, suggests that not all lros share a common biogenetic pathway. thus, lros comprise a very heterogeneous group of organelles that seem to have diverse origins: for example, whereas melanosomes originate from early endosomes, wpbs emerge from the tgn.  <cit> . in addition, although the majority of lros share certain characteristics, many of them display completely different features as well. maturation stage of the cells must also be considered, since the recruitment of rab27a is a dynamic process that depends on the maturation and polarization stage of the cell  <cit> . in this sense, for instance, when von willebrand factor  is heterologously expressed in some cultured cell lines, such as hek- <dig>  it causes the formation of structures similar to wpbs that can recruit endogenous rab27a. in hek- <dig> cells, endogenous rab <dig> was observed in a compact pericentriolar region probably corresponding to the microtubule organizing centre. this endogenous rab <dig> did not show colocalization with lamp <dig> suggesting that there was little or no enrichment of rab <dig> on late endosomes/lysosomes. nevertheless, in vwf expressing hek- <dig> cells, significant enrichment of endogenous rab <dig> was found on the vwf-containing wpb-like organelles that had formed. thus, rab27a was recruited specifically to the vwf-containing organelles and not to the lysosome in a maturation-dependent process that was independent of the cell type  <cit> . therefore, the recruitment of rab27a is a complex process driven by elements such as the maturation stage and the cargo molecules in which protein markers follow a dynamic pattern of expression and reorganization depending on those factors.

once the study model was established, we investigated the relationship between rab27a and hsv- <dig> infection. for this goal, hog cells were infected with ghsv-ul <dig> and k26gfp. ghsv-ul <dig> is a tegument tagged hsv- <dig>  <cit> , whereas k26gfp was obtained fusing gfp to a hsv- <dig> capsid protein  <cit> . after finding a high degree of colocalization between rab27a and tgn, we proceeded to assess whether hsv- <dig> colocalized with rab27a in that compartment. we found that rab27a colocalized with tegument-tagged ghsv-ul <dig> in the tgn, whereas only a very low level of colocalization with capsid-tagged k26gfp was ascertained. this fact might be explained by the fast transit of capsids through the tgn during its rapid egress.

hsv- <dig> acquires tegument and envelope through a process of secondary envelopment by budding into tgn-derived vesicles coated with viral glycoproteins and tegument proteins. consequently, we investigated whether viral glycoproteins were associated with rab27a, finding that this small gtpase colocalized with viral glycoproteins gh and gd, and with ghsv-ul <dig>  on the other hand, viral titer of rab27a-silenced infected cells showed a significant decrease compared with non-target control shrna-expressing and non-transfected cells, supporting the idea of an involvement of rab27a in hsv- <dig> cycle. finally, functional studies showed that rab27a depletion produced a significant decrease on the infection rate. analysis of the number of gfp-expressing cells  <dig> hours after infection with k26gfp virus, showed a significant decrease of these parameters in rab27a-silenced cells compared to non-target control shrna-expressing and non-transfected cells. taken together, these results suggest a possible role for rab27a in hsv- <dig> infection of oligodendrocytic cells. also, the reduction of the size and number of viral plaques in silenced cells, points to an effect of rab27a in the process of viral egress. therefore, rab27a might be involved in viral secretion. since, colocalization between viral glycoproteins and rab27a takes place in the tgn or in tgn-derived vesicles, and given that rab27a depletion also induced a reduction in the viral production, we suggest that rab27a might be required in both processes, viral morphogenesis and egress.

finally, our results show that rab27a depletion reduced both the viral production and viral egress, effect that is not due to a differential entry capacity of virus. therefore, the reduction in the cell-associated infectious viruses under rab27a shrna silencing, and the colocalization between viral glycoproteins and rab27a in the tgn, suggest that rab27a might be relevant for virus morphogenesis, maybe for secondary envelopment.

CONCLUSIONS
our work suggests a role for the small rab gtpase rab27a during hsv- <dig> infection. first of all, herein we show for the first time the expression of this small gtpase in oligodendroglial cells. in spite of the fact that several rab gtpases have been involved in the morphogenesis of herpesviruses, no data about the role of rab27a in hsv- <dig> infection has been reported to date.

microscopy studies demonstrated partial colocalization of rab27a with viral glycoproteins in the tgn. moreover, viral titer of rab27a-silenced infected cells showed a significant decrease compared with control cells. in addition, functional analysis confirmed a significant decrease of gfp-expressing cells  <dig> hour after infection of rab27a-silenced cells with a gfp-tagged hsv- <dig>  reduction of the size and number of viral plaques in rab27a-depleted infected cells, points to an effect of this protein in the process of viral egress. on the other hand, colocalization between viral glycoproteins and rab27a takes place in the tgn or in tgn-derived vesicles, and given that rab27a depletion also induced a reduction in the viral production, we suggest that rab27a might be required in viral morphogenesis and egress.
