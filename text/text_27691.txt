BACKGROUND
mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland to infection, and is usually caused by bacteria. mastitis represents one of the most economically important health traits for milk production, which makes it among the major concerns for the livestock sector  <cit> . although much work has been carried out in dairy ruminants to understand the complex physiological and cellular events that occur in the mammary gland in response to pathogens  <cit> , the protective mechanisms are still poorly understood. invading pathogens activate the immune defence in the udder, which is a complex biological process involving not only resident and recruited immune cells, but also mammary epithelial and endothelial cells. the result is an increase in the number of somatic cells in milk. polymorphic nuclear neutrophil granulocytes are the predominant cell type recruited to the gland  <cit> , and their numbers increase 10- to 50-fold during the first few hours following infection  <cit> . the aetiology of the pathogens influences the severity of the symptoms: contagious pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus agalactiae, cause ongoing chronic disease and sub-clinical mastitis, while the environmental coliform bacteria often cause acute, clinical mastitis  <cit> . variation in presentation of the disease between pathogens may be the result of differences in the capability of the innate immune system to mount initial defences. this may be linked to factors such as recognition of pathogen derived antigen e.g. by toll-like receptors  or the mobilisation of bactericidal effector molecules such as the β-defensins.

immediate and appropriate recognition of the invading pathogen is fundamental for the prompt and proper activation of the immune response of the host. infection will only be able to develop and the disease become manifest if these mechanisms fail. studies in humans and model organisms have revealed that receptors and effector molecules of the innate immune system are a crucial first line of disease defence. an infection sets in motion a, normally, well ordered cascade of defence mechanisms to eliminate the pathogen, in which innate and adaptive immune mechanisms cooperate. however, there are no consistent descriptions of mastitis-related mammary gland-specific expression of the key factors controlling the innate immune system. previous analyses have been focused on effector mechanisms in later stages of the adaptive immune response to an infection  <cit> , studies of the early phases of infection which could shed light on innate defence mechanisms process in the udder are currently missing. such studies can only be achieved in controlled infection experiments where the time of infection and pathogen involved are known.

disease response is a complex trait under multi-genic control, which makes it difficult to develop appropriate genetic selection strategies for improved immune response. nevertheless, a genetic component of host responses to bacteria during intra-mammary infections has been widely documented, and mastitis has a heritability up to 20% in goats  <cit> . breeding to improve resistance to mastitis has had limited success, as very little is known about the genetic basis of resistance and functional complexity of the host pathogen interaction during infection. the overriding problems of developing an appropriate selection strategy to control mastitis are  the plethora of pathogens that cause mastitis, each of which may elicit a different immune response, and  the strong environmental and management effects on the incidence of mastitis  <cit> . the number of somatic cells in milk is correlated with intra-mammary infection and cattle breeders have used somatic cell scores  in genetic selection for reducing mastitis. however, it is not certain how well scs predicts immune response to infection with a mastitis causing pathogens, or incidence of clinical mastitis. nevertheless, breeding programmes for mastitis resistance in dairy cattle  <cit>  and sheep  <cit>  have used scs as a selection criterion. for goats, the relevance of scs as a predictor of parameters of udder health and the susceptibility against mastitis is still untested.

over the last decade techniques for studying the transcriptome have improved dramatically, in particular the use of microarrays that represent a large proportion of the expressed genes. the application of these approaches for dairy ruminants transcriptome profiling has identified genes, pathways and regulatory networks activated in mammary tissues during experimental infection by various pathogens, including e. coli, s. aureus and s. uberis <cit> . the meta-analysis of transcription-profiling data from six independent studies of the mammary gland infected with different pathogens identified common signatures of infection among species and that were characteristic of early vs late stage responses  <cit> .

the objectives of the present study were to investigate the early response of goats to a controlled infection with s. aureus by following gene expression responses in immune related cells in the blood and milk in order to better understand the local and systemic response. the study also compared the responses of two divergent lines of goat selected for high and low milk scs.

RESULTS
intra-mammary s. aureus growth following experimental infection
following intra-mammary experimental infection with s. aureus, the pathogen could be cultured from the milk of all  <dig> experimentally infected animals at  <dig> hours, and at the final sampling 30h post-infection, s. aureus could be cultured from  <dig> of the  <dig> infected animals. s. aureus present in milk samples reached a maximum at 18h post-infection with a mean of  <dig>  log <dig> cfu/ml  in the low scs  line animals and  <dig>  log <dig> cfu/ml the high scs  selection line goats. the number of s. aureus then remained constant for the rest of the study period . strain analysis using the rapd-pcr  method confirmed that s. aureus isolated from infected udders were the same as the strain used for the infection . the control pbs-infused udders remained free from detectable infection throughout the study. no significant difference was observed in s. aureus counts at different time points in milk from lscs and hscs goats.

systemic and localized inflammatory responses to s. aureus intra-mammary infection
as an indicator of a systemic response to s. aureus infection, rectal temperatures were monitored throughout the study. body temperature showed an upward trend from  <dig> to  <dig> h post-infection, however, the increased temperature was only significant  at the  <dig> and  <dig> h time points. temperatures reached a maximum  <dig> h after infection and reached a peak mean  of  <dig>   and  <dig>   °c in lscs and hscs goats, respectively, which is not a significant difference .

the systemic response to intra-mammary infection with s. aureus was characterized by a significant decrease  of total blood leukocyte  and of neutrophil  numbers 18h post-infection. the tbl and neu counts were  <dig>  and  <dig>  x  <dig> cells/ml in lscs goats and  <dig>  and  <dig>  x  <dig> cells/ml in hscs goats. the lowest blood cell counts were reached at 30h post-infection, when the tbl and neu counts were  <dig>  and  <dig>  x  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig>  x  <dig> cells/ml in lscs and hscs goats, respectively .

changes in milk scc  were monitored as an indicator of local response. mean milk sccs , before s. aureus intra-mammary infection, were  <dig>  x <dig> and  <dig> x <dig> for lscs left and right udder halves respectively, and  <dig>  x <dig> and  <dig>  x <dig> for hscs left and right udder halves respectively at t <dig>  increases in milk scc were initially observed after  <dig> h of infection. milk scc in the right hand control udders, infused with saline, remained unchanged throughout the study in lscs goats, while milk scc in right hand udder halves of hscs goats increased significantly  .

the differential milk somatic cell composition was compared between lscs and hscs goats before and following infection. the mean proportion of macrophages in lscs  and hscs  prior to challenge was statistically significant . after the challenge, for lscs a significant increase in neutrophils was observed at t <dig> vs t <dig>  and t <dig> vs t <dig>  and decrease was observed for macrophages , lymphocytes  and epithelial cells  . for hscs a significant increase in neutrophils was found at t <dig> vs t <dig> , while significant decreases were seen for macrophages  and for epithelial cells .

**p-value <  <dig> ; ***p-value <  <dig> .

therefore, statistically different increase and variations in somatic cell composition were seen in the in right hand udder halves of hscs vs lscs goats , whereas there were no statistically significant differences in either blood or milk between the hscs and lscs goats for the other phenotypic responses  at any of the time points after infection.

gene expression analysis of milk samples
no differences in gene expression were found at any of the time points between the two selection lines . analysing the two groups together , a total of  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed  in milk scc between t <dig> and t <dig> and  <dig> genes between t <dig> and t <dig>  among these genes, the majority  showed an increase in expression. ingenuity pathway analysis , was able to identify  <dig> and  <dig> genes respectively for t <dig> and t <dig> of milk samples, based on comparative annotation using human or mouse orthologs within the ipa knowledge base . the  <dig> genes in milk somatic cells  showing the greatest increase in expression post infection between  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold  play an important role in  immune and inflammatory response ;  the regulation of innate resistance to pathogens ; and  the regulation of cell metabolism . fewer genes showing reduced expression between − <dig>  to − <dig>  fold  were involved in  lipid metabolism ,  chemokine, cytokine and intracellular signalling , and  the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix .

canonical pathway
the most represented canonical signalling and metabolic pathways among the differentially expressed genes at t <dig> and t <dig> included mif-mediated glucocorticoid regulation, mif regulation of innate immunity, nf-kb signalling, il- <dig> signalling and hypoxia signalling in cardiovascular system for t <dig> and production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in macrophages, lxr/rxr activation, toll-like receptor signalling, acute phase response signalling and mif-mediated glucocorticoid regulation for t <dig> . the majority of genes with >  <dig>  fold change in expression between t <dig> and t <dig> within these pathways had an increase in expression. among the five pathways, three were related to immune or inflammatory functions: il- <dig> signalling, which limits the inflammatory response, production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in macrophages and mif-mediated glucocorticoid regulation, which promote the inflammatory response. the pathway analysis also revealed that the toll-like receptor signalling pathway was activated. toll-like receptor activation is known to stimulate the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to the bacterial infection, and the lxr/rxr activation pathway which is involved in inflammation and lipid metabolism.

five most significant canonical pathways identified with ipa using the significantly affected genes for t <dig> and t <dig>  the identified canonical pathways are listed from the lowest to the highest p-value, and are reported with the involved genes and the corresponding ratio .

at t <dig> and t <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> networks were identified using ingenuity pathway analysis, respectively. the t <dig> networks contained a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes which were involved in pathways and functions including the cellular movement, haematological system, immune cell trafficking, haematopoiesis, tissue development, antigen presentation, cellular compromise, cellular function and maintenance and inflammatory response. the t <dig> networks contained a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes involved in pathways and functions including inflammatory response, digestive system development and function, hepatic system development and function, cell-to-cell signalling and interaction, tissue development, haematological system development and function, kidney failure, organismal injury and abnormalities, renal and urological disease, tumor morphology, amino acid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, cell death, cellular compromise.

meta-analysis
the meta-analysis of expression data from the milk samples cells across all the time points identified twenty differentially expressed genes . these genes could be placed into  <dig> pathways, with  <dig> gene  in common. two genes  were common to  <dig> pathways: toll like receptor signalling, role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses, production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in macrophages. the remaining  <dig> genes were distributed as follows:  <dig> genes  in phospholipase c signalling pathway,  <dig> genes  in production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in macrophages,  <dig> genes  in il- <dig> signalling,  <dig> gene  in toll like receptor signalling and  <dig> genes  in role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses .

gene expression analysis in white blood cells 
no changes in expression were found between t <dig> and t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> for wbc either in the hscs or lscs lines, or if the data from both lines were combined. however, analysing the combined data, at t <dig>  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed when compared with t <dig> . eight of these genes showed an increased level of expression and one showed a decrease in expression .

real-time pcr analyses for microarray data validation
the expression of rpl13a  showed no significant variation among time points for both milk and blood cells on the array and was therefore used as reference gene for qpcr for both milk and blood samples.

real-time qpcr was used to confirm the gene expression differences in expression of some genes between  <dig> h  and  <dig> h  post challenge for milk derived cells and  <dig> h  for blood cells.

the gene with the greatest increase in expression from the array data was the ptx <dig> , which showed a logfc of  <dig>  in the milk derived cells at t <dig> and a logfc of  <dig>  in blood cells at t <dig>  the strong increase in gene expression of this gene was confirmed by qpcr with a logfc of  <dig>   and  <dig>   for milk and  <dig>   for blood samples.

changes in expression observed at  <dig> h after challenge , from the microarray data were confirmed by qpcr for following genes: s <dig> calcium-binding protein a <dig> , hormone receptor-like  <dig> , hormone receptor-like  <dig> precursor  genes for blood and colony stimulating factor  <dig> receptor , complement c <dig> precursor , il- <dig> receptor beta , leukocyte elastase inhibitor , myeloid differentiation , pellino protein , t-cell activation rho , thrombomodulin fragment , toll-like receptor  <dig> precursor , tumor necrosis factor  genes for milk samples .

discussion
this study used a custom microarray to characterise the changes in gene expression during the early response of the goat mammary gland following intra-mammary infection with s. aureus. as insufficient caprine sequences were available to create a dedicated goat array, a bovine combimatrix 90k custom array was used  <cit> . technical replicates in preliminary cross species hybridization experiments showed good correlation between replicates confirming the possibility to successfully use this microarray for gene expression analysis in goats. the potential mis-identification of genes using a cross species array was considered to be a potential problem, however, this could be corrected for using specific probes in a subsequent qprc confirmation step. thirteen genes with differential expression pre and post infection identified from the microarray analysis were tested by qpcr. in all cases the direction and magnitude of the change in expression seen on the array was confirmed, thus validating the use of the bovine array with goat.

transcriptome differences between high and low scc animal groups
somatic cell score is strongly correlated with intra-mammary infection, and mastitis incidence in cattle. somatic cells score is used in genetic selection with the hope that this will select animal genetically less susceptible to mastitis. pathogens can only multiply in sufficient quantity to become resident in the gland if the defence mechanisms fail, or are slow to respond to the infection. therefore, control of invading pathogens within the mammary gland is crucial to prevent the establishment of an infection in the udder, therefore immune cell recruitment is an important part of mammary gland defence against pathogens. understanding the genetic basis of activation and recruitment of these cells is therefore important to understand the role of these cells in mastitis defence.

goats from two lines selected for high and low scs were investigated in this study with the hypothesis that the mammary response and function may differ between the lines. a significant difference in macrophage numbers in the udder was observed between the two divergent selection lines prior to infection . as macrophages are the first cellular type involved in the elimination of invading bacteria, the difference may result in dissimilarities between the hscs and lscs in early response to natural infection. however, no differences in gene expression in the milk derived cells between the two lines were observed following the experimental challenge carried out in this study. the changes in the numbers and ratios between of cell types are variables dependent on the individual with as much variation seen between compared within line.

changes expression were also measured in wbc to examine the type and kinetics of systemic in addition to mammary specific responses. changes in gene expression were observed in the udder from the earliest time point following infection and at  <dig> hours post infection a large number of genes showed differences. in the blood white cells  no change in expression was observed at early time points, while at  <dig> hours post infection only  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed. as may be expected this shows that the systemic response is slower than in the udder following infection with s. aureus and that the changes in expression are more restricted, at least in the early phases. this is not surprising as cells in the udder are becoming activated in themselves to respond directly to the invading pathogen or signalling to activate and recruit other cells to the site of infection. this is seen in the gene pathways that are activated and discussed below. changes occurring in the blood are more suitable, at least at these early stages of infection. unfortunately samples were not available to investigate how the response progressed later than  <dig> hours following infection.

gene expression of milk somatic cells
the pmn, lymphocytes, macrophages, and epithelial cells in the milk represent important components of the innate immune defence of the mammary gland  <cit> .

these cells release chemokines that stimulate a rapid influx of pmn to combat the bacteria. this response was clearly seen in the present study such that at 24-30h post infection pmn reached over 80% of cells present, while the percentages of macrophages, lymphocytes and epithelial cells significantly decreased. differences in cell types composition change the genes products that are detected, irrespective of the actual changes in expression occurring within particular cell types. this makes the interpretation of the data difficult, as the cell population, as well as gene expression within cell types have to be taken into account.

the significant change in macrophage percentages among different time points is related to changes in genes detected that are within canonical macrophages specific pathways such as mif-mediated glucocorticoid regulation, mif regulation of innate immunity, and production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in macrophages. the expression of these pathways increased in the context that the macrophage cells percentage decreased, then there is an enormous increase in expression of these genes. therefore, the microarray data from milk scc in this study partly reflect changes in gene expression as a result of alteration in cell proportions within the mammary gland, and partly changes in expression within cell types.

at  <dig> h following inoculation with s. aureus transcription levels of  <dig> genes were significantly changed in milk somatic cells. these genes fell into functional pathways which associated with cell death, cellular movement, cellular growth and proliferation, cell-to-cell signalling and interaction, and lipid metabolism.

the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor alpha , interleukin  <dig> alpha , interleukin  <dig>  were increased in the scc following challenge. these cytokines are associated with inflammatory processes and are involved in recruitment and activation of neutrophils into the infected tissue  <cit> . this response following the recognition of invading pathogens, is characteristic of macrophages present among the milk somatic cells, and is instrumental in attracting pmn involved in immune defence from the blood to the mammary gland. the response to this signalling is observed in the increased % of pmn found in the infected gland at  <dig> hours. expression of the gene coding for cd <dig> antigen , a pivotal cell surface protein on macrophages, that interacts with toll-like receptors mediating detection of bacterial cell wall components, was also increased.

the acute phase response is a rapid and a non-specific inflammatory response that provides the initial line of protection against microorganisms and is regulated through the expression of several cytokines  <cit> . this is consistent with the early stage response observed in the scc which involves changes in expression of pathways, including il- <dig> signalling  and lxr/rxr activation . a close relationship between polyamine regulation, in particular the sub-group spermine, and il- <dig> signalling has been previously reported in macrophages  <cit> . an increase of il- <dig> and il- <dig> expression in somatic cells during mastitis infection has also been previously reported in cattle  <cit> .

the persistence inflammation, induced by cytokines, is harmful for cells  <cit>  and the affected organ. therefore the observed activation of the il- <dig> signalling, which modulates immune response during the early acute response stage of mastitis infection is important to limit the inflammatory response and tissue damage within the udder. interleukin- <dig> is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that blocks nf-kb activity, which leads to suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as tnf, il <dig>  and il <dig>  expression was significantly increased for  <dig> out of  <dig> putative genes of the il- <dig> signalling pathway present on the microarray following infection. interleukin  <dig> receptor antagonist  and interleukin  <dig> receptor beta  are also part of the il- <dig> signalling pathway and limit inflammatory response, as well as regulating b-cells, t-cells, nk-cells and dendritic cell division and differentiation, which is associated with the immune response.

lipid metabolism is generally inhibited during the intra-mammary infections  <cit> . in the present study the lxr/rxr pathway which is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, inflammation, and cholesterol to bile acid catabolism  <cit>  showed reduced expression in scc following infection. the ppar family consists of pparα, pparδ, and pparγ, each of which act as ligand activated transcriptional regulators. expression of these genes was found to be reduced following infection in the present study. the ppar ligands include n- <dig> and n- <dig> unsaturated fatty acids and their eicosanoid products, thus ppars are involved in the regulation intracellular lipid levels. ppar is highly expressed in adipose tissue and macrophages and primarily regulates adipogenesis, but also interferes with the transcription of proinflammatory factors such as stat and nf-κb in macrophages  <cit> . the down regulation of lxr and rxr and the ppar genes suggest that during the early stage response to mastitis there might be a “general” deregulation of the lipid metabolism. this has also been observed in cattle infected with s. uberis by moyes et al. <cit> , where the intra-mammary infection led to the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways, and a marked inhibition of lipid synthesis. the expression of lxr and ppar and signalling most likely by pparγ, may provide mechanistic explanation for the inverse relationship between immune response ad fat synthesis. in humans, there is evidence that lipoproteins are part of the innate immune system, and changes in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism that occur during the host response to infection have an anti-infective and anti-inflammatory effect that contributes to the host defence  <cit> .

moreover, in the stromal vascular fraction, adipose tissue also contains macrophages that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tnf-α, il-1β and il- <dig>  <cit> . studies focused on the effect of intra-mammary infection in adipose tissue of ruminants are lacking. in a recent work adipose tissue in dairy cows appears to respond in vitro to an immune challenge by increased gene expression of cytokines  <cit> .

meta-analysis approaches are used to combine or integrate information from independent studies to overcome low statistical power in studies and identify common results to increase confidence in the generality of information  <cit> . in the present study meta-analysis was used to combine information across samples and time-points, which identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes  which are involved in five pathways. pentraxin  <dig>  was significantly associated with response to infection and increased the expression in both scc and blood pmn. ptx <dig> is a c-type lectin domain family  <dig> member a  and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing  <dig>  belonged to the role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses pathway.

the innate immune system uses a several receptors  that recognize conserved microbial structures or pathogen-associated molecular patterns , such as those that occur in the bacterial cell-wall components peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide. pprs are classified as:  membrane bound prrs which include toll-like receptors ,  extracellular prrs that include the complement proteins, pentraxins and collectins involved in the process of opsonization, phagocytosis and apoptosis and  cytoplasmic prrs which include the nod proteins that regulating the cytokine induction initiated by bacterial ligands.

ptx <dig> is involved in the initial response of mammary tissue to bacterial infection  <cit> , and is thought to activate the immune system by binding both micro-organisms and c1q, the first component of the classical pathway of complement activation. nod <dig>  is expressed in monocytes/macrophages, and detects peptidoglican from gram-negative  and gram-positive bacteria   <cit> . although s. aureus is usually an extracellular bacterium, it has been shown to be internalised by different mammalian cells such as pulmonary epithelial cells, enterocytes and neutrophils in a manner dependent on the expression of the virulence regulators agr and sara <cit> . the peptidoglycan fragments from cytoplasm-dwelling bacteria could, therefore, be available for recognition by nod <dig> and initiate nod-dependent cellular responses, making this gene a potential marker for this pathogen infection.

gene expression white blood cells
the first changes in gene expression seen in wbc were observed at 30h post-infection and coincided with the lowest tbl and neu counts. at this time point  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed. as for milk somatic cells, in wbc the gene with the highest fold change was ptx <dig>  it was the first long pentraxin identified, an interleukin- <dig> inducible gene expressed in endothelial cells  <cit>  and is a tumor necrosis factor α  inducible gene in fibroblasts  <cit> . ptx <dig> is produced by macrophages and other cell types upon stimulation with primary inflammatory mediators such as lps, il- <dig> or tnf-α  <cit> . ptx <dig> plasma levels are very low in normal circumstances  but expression has been shown to increase following pathogen infection  <cit> . ptx <dig> is a functional ancestor of antibodies, recognizing microorganisms, activating complement, and facilitating pathogen recognition by phagocytes. hence it plays a role in resistance against selected pathogens  <cit> . mature ptx <dig> is stored in specific granules by neutrophils and is secreted following recognition of microbial moieties and inflammatory signals  <cit> . this protein has been previously identified as one of the most up-regulated genes after imi with s. aureus <cit> . ptx <dig> together with s100a <dig> act as anti-microbial agents that could assist defence of the mammary gland against chronic and subclinical infections. in the present study ptx <dig> was the most significantly up-regulated gene in both somatic cells  and in wbc  in response to s. aureus infection in goats.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study early response to an experimental challenge with s. aureus was studied between two divergent lines of goat selected for high and low milk somatic cell scores. although the two lines had a pre-infection difference in milk scc, the gene expression analysis of scs from the two lines  following infection did not show significant differences. the expression analysis showed that expression changes were largely consistent with changes in the cell types in milk, and the activation of immune cell types. an inverse relationship between immune response and lipid metabolism was observed and has previously been described in other species, including cow and sheep.

ptx <dig> had the higher log fold change in expression in both in milk and in blood and is a candidate for further studies on the genetic basis of variations to in immune response associated with mastitis.
