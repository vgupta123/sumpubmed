BACKGROUND
adventitious root  formation in leafy stem cuttings is a crucial process for the propagation of many ornamental plant species. vegetative propagation of plants relies on the ability of shoot cuttings to effectively generate such roots. there is, however, a dramatic variation between species in their capability to form ar  <cit> . during ar formation roots develop from non-root tissue, mostly aerial plant parts such as hypocotyls, leaves and stems  <cit> . the origin of ars varies among plant species and organ or tissue they develop from  <cit> . ars always develop from cells neighboring vascular tissues and can initiate from hypocotyl pericycle cells, phloem or xylem parenchyma cells, young secondary phloem cells, or interfascicular cambium cells. in arabidopsis thaliana, a model often used to investigate ar formation, rooting is induced by pre-etiolation of intact seedlings. after supply with sugars or hormones or after transfer into light they develop roots at the intact hypocotyl . in this model system, ar formation occurs without stresses that disrupt root-shoot correlative influences  <cit> . this is in contrast to leafy cuttings, which are subjected to severance from the donor plant accompanied by injury and the isolation from functional integrity of the whole plant conditions  <cit> . in both, pre-etiolated seedlings and leafy cuttings, ar formation is a complex process influenced by multiple endogenous and exogenous factors, including phytohormones, light, wounding, and stress  <cit> . among the endogenous factors, the phytohormones are the most important modulators of ar formation—it has become obvious that auxin and ethylene  play a central role, but they interact with one another; with other phytohormones and with environmental cues in complex networks  <cit> .

for petunia hybrida, a model plant for ar development on leafy cuttings, a three-phase mechanism was postulated for the metabolic responses involved in ar formation  <cit>  consisting of  establishment of a sink,  a recovery phase and of  a maintenance phase. in the first phase, the excision of cuttings leads to rapid and transient increase in the wound-phytohormone jasmonic acid  and a continuous accumulation of soluble and insoluble carbohydrates  <cit> . it was hypothesized that wounding accompanied by the rise in ja initiates the establishment of a sink tissue necessary to facilitate subsequent ar formation. with that, wound-induced ja accumulation at the cutting stem base has been regarded as an early, transient and critical event for rooting of petunia cuttings. remarkably, in arabidopsis intact hypocotyls jasmonates negatively regulate adventitious rooting, and their homeostasis is under control of auxin  <cit> .

jasmonates are ubiquitously occurring signaling compounds in plants and accumulate in response to biotic and abiotic stress as well as in development  <cit> . ja and its molecularly active metabolite -7-iso-jasmonoyl isoleucine  are lipid-derived compounds and are synthesized from α-linolenic acid by one of seven different branches of the lipoxygenase  pathway  <cit> . lox and the two following enzymatic steps are located in the plastids and involve the action of an allene oxide synthase and an allene oxide cyclase  leading to formation of the intermediate cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid . further reactions occur in peroxisomes and form ja, which is enzymatically converted to ja-ile within the cytosol. ja-ile was demonstrated to mediate binding of the co-receptor proteins coronatine insensitive <dig>  and jasmonate zim domain , thereby triggering ja responses .

within the ja pathway the aoc-catalyzed step is regarded as the crucial step as here the exclusive formation of the enantiomeric form occurring in natural cyclopentanones like ja and ja-ile is facilitated  <cit> . in petunia, the aoc is constitutively present in stem tissue, and has constantly high activity  <cit> . additionally, phaoc belongs to the wound-induced genes, and its transcript levels increase following endogenous rise in ja/ja-ile  <cit> .

to study the role of ja in ar formation in leafy cuttings of petunia by a reverse genetic approach, the cdna of phaoc was used to generate an rnai construct for the stable transformation of plants to partially suppress phaoc expression. our data clearly show that this suppression markedly decreases the accumulation of jasmonates as tested in leaves after mechanical wounding. additionally, suppression of phaoc caused a delay in ar formation. to get insights into how diminished ja levels might affect ar formation, stem bases of cuttings from transgenic plants were used to comparatively analyze levels of iaa and aminocyclopropane carboxylate , but also transcript levels of a cell wall invertase  encoding gene as well as sugar contents.

RESULTS
among the lipid-derived compounds, octadecanoids and jasmonates have a crucial role in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, but also in developmental processes  <cit> . ja was suggested to be one of several endogenous factors regulating the formation of ar  <cit> . for petunia cuttings, their excision is characterized by a fast and transient increase in the level of ja followed by induction of genes encoding ja biosynthesis genes and proteins involved in sink establishment, such as cell wall invertases   <cit> .

generation of transgenic plants with reduced jasmonate levels
to elucidate the role of jasmonates in formation of ar in petunia, the endogenous levels of jasmonates were reduced by a transgenic approach. transgenic plants exhibiting an impaired ja biosynthesis were generated by the rnai-mediated knock-down of the expression of the gene encoding aoc. aoc of petunia is encoded by a single copy gene . a 180-bp fragment covering a middle part of the phaoc-coding region was used to generate the phaoc-rnai construct, which was introduced into petunia plants via a. tumefaciens mediated transformation. the expression of phaoc-rnai is under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter, thereby conferring constitutive expression in all plant tissues. t <dig> plants were grown together with wild-type plants and plants expressing the empty vector phellsgate  as controls. three transgenic phaoc–rnai lines exhibiting significant reduction of phaoc transcripts  were selected. the phaoc–rnai lines  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> exhibited residual phaoc transcript levels between  <dig> and 17 % in comparison to the controls. this reduced level of phaoc-transcript caused a reduction of aoc protein contents to undetectable amounts as shown by immunoblot analyses . as visualized by the immuno cytological analysis, in wild type stems aoc is located within plastids of internal phloem cells as well as of xylem parenchyma cells of the amphiphloic siphonostele .i in the phaoc–rnai line, however, the protein amount is below the detection limit . consequently, cuttings of the phaoc-rnai lines exhibited a significant reduction of aoc-activity to 9–18 % in comparison to the controls .fig.  <dig> accumulation of phaoc transcripts, aoc protein and activity in stem bases of cuttings of petunia hybrida expressing phaoc-rnai.  stem bases were collected from leafy cuttings of wild type , two lines expressing the empty vector  and three lines expressing a phaoc-rnai construct  at one hour after excision. relative phaoc transcript accumulation shown as 2−Δct values in relation to the reference gene phrsp <dig> was determined by qrt-pcr.  aoc protein was detected immunocytologically in cross sections of stem bases using an antibody specific binding to aoc. note the occurrence of aoc in plastids visible as distinct dots within cells . bars represent 100 μm and 25 μm in overviews and inset, respectively.  aoc enzyme activity is given as nmol g− <dig> fw of enzymatically formed opda. each value is represented by the mean of eight independent biological replicates ± se. different letters within each graph designate statistically different values 



mechanical wounding is a well-known trigger to induce ja biosynthesis  <cit>  and leads also in petunia to a transient rise in jasmonates  <cit> . in order to check whether the down-regulation of phaoc transcript levels in the transgenic plants was sufficient to modulate endogenous jasmonate levels, contents of opda, ja and ja-ile were determined in leaves one hour after mechanical wounding. indeed, wound induced levels of opda, ja and ja-ile were significantly lower in phaoc-rnai lines than in the controls . most importantly, the levels of the bioactive jasmonate, ja-ile, were diminished by a factor of four. all these data indicate that the successful suppression of phaoc expression in transgenic plants is accompanied by a reduced accumulation of jasmonates upon wound stress occurring in stem bases after excision of cuttings.fig.  <dig> contents of jasmonates in wounded leaves of petunia hybrida expressing phaoc-rnai. contents of 12-oxophytodienoic acid , jasmonic acid  and ja-ile  in leaves of wild type , two lines expressing the empty vector  and three lines expressing a phaoc-rnai construct  harvested one hour after mechanical wounding. each value is represented by the mean of eight independent biological replicates ± se. different letters within each graph designate statistically different values 



formation of adventitious roots in plants with reduced jasmonate levels
using the transgenic lines described above, the question was addressed whether adventitious root development is affected by the reduced levels of jasmonates. for this purpose, leafy cuttings of all plant lines were transferred without any external additives to perlite as neutral substrate. after  <dig>   <dig>  and 21 days after excision  numbers of root primordia and emerged adventitious roots were determined . adventitious roots were not yet emerging from stem bases of all lines analyzed at  <dig> dpe. however, significantly fewer root primordia were detected in the stem base of cuttings of phaoc-rnai plants in comparison to wild type and the empty vector control plants . numbers of primordia of phaoc-rnai lines were reduced by 70–90 %. this effect on root primordia was not detectable anymore at the two later time points analyzed. at  <dig> dpe, adventitious roots emerged from all cuttings . here, cuttings of phaoc-rnai plants developed significantly fewer roots than cuttings of the controls: root numbers of cuttings of phaoc-rnai line  <dig> and  <dig> were reduced to 70 %, whereas the root number of cuttings of the phaoc-rnai line  <dig> was reduced to 50 % of that of the controls. the reduced number of roots emerged from cuttings of phaoc-rnai plants was still visible at  <dig> dpe, although to a lesser extent . these data suggest that ar formation is delayed in cuttings from plants exhibiting decreased ja levels resulting in a decreased number of roots at  <dig> and  <dig> dpe.fig.  <dig> effect of down-regulation of phaoc on rooting of petunia hybrida cuttings. rooting was rated at  <dig>   <dig> and 21 days post excision  by counting primordia  and emerged roots  in cuttings of wild type , two lines expressing the empty vector  and three lines expressing a phaoc-rnai construct . each value is represented by the mean of eight independent biological replicates  consisting each of three technical replicates . different letters within each graph designate statistically different values 



these data show that ja deficiency resulted in lower numbers of ars, but the ar formation itself was not abolished. therefore, wound-induced jasmonates might function as an accelerator of ar formation in petunia and might act therefore as positive regulators. this is in line with the proposed role of ja in ar formation in petunia and in other species rooted under in vitro conditions. for potato   <cit>  and pea   <cit>  stem cuttings, and tobacco  thin cell layers  <cit>  it was shown that in the presence of exogenous auxin, ja promotes synergistically ar formation. however, these data contrast with data obtained on ar formation in arabidopsis intact hypocotyls, where ja inhibits ar initiation through the coi <dig> signaling pathway  <cit> . these apparent contradictions suggest that there might be either species-specific differences between arabidopsis and other dicots in respect to ar formation or organ and cultivation-specific differences that may alter the balance between auxin and ja regulating ar formation  <cit> . indeed, intact seedlings, de-rooted older plants and cuttings show significant differences, not only in root founding tissues, but also in auxin requirements, sensitivity, and rooting mutant phenotypes  <cit> . this holds also true for de-rooted seedlings of petunia, which showed reduced numbers of ars after treatment with jasmonates . treatments with opda, ja and ja-ile at lower concentrations  did not changed ar numbers. higher concentrations  of all compounds, however, significantly reduced the root number, whereas 100 μm ja even completely inhibited ar formation. in contrast to jasmonate treatments, de-rooted seedlings treated with the auxin  <dig> -dichlorophenoxy acetic acid  or acc developed significantly more ars than control plants . combined application of ja and either  <dig> -d or acc showed that both,  <dig> -d and acc, suppressed the inhibitory effect of ja on development of ars, and ja did not diminished the promoting effects of  <dig> -d and acc .

effects of diminished jasmonate levels on role of auxin and ethylene in root formation
it is well accepted that et and auxins play an important role in stimulating the process of ar formation through the different phases  <cit> . therefore, the levels of iaa and acc, the precursor of et, were determined in ja-deficient cuttings. in parallel, auxin-induced and et-induced gene expression was monitored by determination of transcript levels of a petunia gh <dig> homologue  and acc oxidase <dig> , respectively. in wild type cuttings, free iaa levels increased transiently about two-fold at  <dig> and  <dig> hpe followed by increased transcript accumulation of phdeva-20-c <dig> , whereas acc levels increased about 200-fold within  <dig> hpe  <cit> . therefore, free iaa and acc levels as well as transcript accumulation of phdeva-20-c <dig> and phaco <dig> were measured in stem bases of cuttings at  <dig> and  <dig> hpe, respectively . there were no differences in free iaa content and phdeva-20-c <dig> transcript levels between phaoc-rnai lines and the controls . similar results were obtained in respect to acc levels and transcript accumulation of the et responsive gene phaco <dig> , which both also did not show significant differences between ja-deficient plants and wild type/transformation control.fig.  <dig> effect of down-regulation of phaoc on accumulation of indole acetic acid , amino cyclopropane-1-carboxy acid  as well as phdeva-20-c <dig> and phaco <dig> transcripts in stem bases of petunia hybrida cuttings.  content of iaa and  of acc, both given as pmol g− <dig> fw at  <dig> hpe,  relative phdeva-20-c <dig> transcript accumulation and  relative phaco <dig> transcript accumulation, both shown as 2-Δct values in relation to the reference gene phrsp <dig> at  <dig> hpe. stem bases were collected from cuttings of wild type , two lines expression the empty vector  and three lines expressing a phaoc-rnai construct . each value is represented by the mean of eight independent biological replicates ± se. different letters within each graph designate statistically different values 



these results showed that diminished ja levels did not change the levels and action of both, auxin and et in cuttings, although auxin, et, and ja were found to be coordinately  regulated or exhibit opposite effects on many plant responses  <cit> . auxin is considered as inductor of ar formation in leafy cuttings – after detachment of the shoot, basipetal polar transport of auxin contributes to auxin accumulation in the stem base  <cit> . the rise of free auxin in the basal stem very probably contributes to the early events of ar formation  <cit> . additionally, ar formation is also dependent on the action of et  <cit> , which is synthesized after wounding during the cutting process  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that in the process of ar formation ja acts independently from auxin and et, since diminished ja levels in the transgenic cuttings delayed the formation of ar without changing auxin and et levels and signaling. it cannot completely be excluded that alterations in hormone levels and related gene expression might occur at other time points than those analyzed. this is, however, not very probable, since the time points used represent in each case the time point of the transient maximum of the respective hormone/transcript level in wild type cuttings .

effects of diminished jasmonate levels on cell wall invertase and sugar levels during root formation
cwi is a key enzyme of the apoplastic phloem unloading of transported sucrose and links jasmonate action with primary metabolism  <cit> . it can establish a sink function of a certain tissue and thus provide a mechanism for flexible and appropriate adjustment to a wide range of internal and external stimuli  <cit> . to test, whether altered jasmonate levels might affect the induction of the gene encoding cwi and thereby influencing the establishment of the sink  <cit> , transcript levels of 3cl <dig> and cwi activity were determined at  <dig> hpe and  <dig> hpe, respectively . both time points represent the respective maximum after excision of wild type cuttings  <cit> . comparing cutting stem bases of phaoc-rnai with that of wild type and empty vectors controls, there were no differences in 3cl <dig> transcript levels and cwi activity. additionally, the levels of glucose, fructose and sucrose were determined. the levels of these three compounds reached maximum levels in wild type cuttings at  <dig> hpe, the time point at which first differentiating root primordia are detectable within the stem base  <cit> . at this time point the significant reduction in the number of root primordia was found for phaoc-rnai cuttings in comparison to the controls . neither glucose and fructose, nor sucrose exhibited significantly different levels in stem bases of the three genotypes under analysis at  <dig> hpi .table  <dig> transcript accumulation and activity of cell wall invertase, and sugar content in stem bases of cuttings of wild type, phell and phaoc-rnai plants

these results indicate that the wound-induced rise in jasmonates might not be causal for the sink establishment, which was postulated as necessary step in induction of ar formation in petunia  <cit>  and pea  <cit> . for the onset of ar formation in petunia cuttings, a ‘sink establishment phase’ was defined that might be controlled by wound-induced rise of ja leading in turn to the induction of genes coding for enzymes that degrade sucrose  <cit> . a similar correlation was drawn from analysis of pea cuttings derived from plants at different developmental stages  <cit> . in comparison to cuttings from juvenile plants, cuttings from older plants exhibited a postponed accumulation of ja and an impaired ar formation, which was supposed to be caused by a delay in sink-establishment  <cit> . the results shown here by the transgenic approach, however, contrast to both scenarios and demonstrate that diminished ja biosynthesis did not result in altered carbohydrate levels in petunia cuttings.

CONCLUSIONS
here, it was demonstrated that the transgenic expression of a phaoc-rnai construct leads to severe down-regulation of ja biosynthesis in petunia cuttings accompanied by an altered ar formation. the reduced numbers of root primordia and ar on leafy cuttings of phaoc-rnai plants in comparison to wild type and the empty vector control support the assumption that jasmonates act as positive regulators of ar formation in leafy cuttings of petunia. since the ar formation was not completely abolished but rather delayed, jasmonates might act as an accelerator of ar formation. in addition, it is unlikely that levels and signaling of auxin and et as well as gene expression and activity of cwi were altered by ja deficiency and are causal for the delay in ar formation in these plants. analysis of other phytohormones known to be involved in ar formation, such as cytokinins or strigolactones  <cit> , will be required to unravel how jasmonates regulate ar formation.
