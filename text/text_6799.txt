BACKGROUND
nellore is a beef cattle  breed that originated in india. the first specimens of the breed arrived in brazil at the end of the 18th century and nellore animals rapidly became the predominant breed in the brazilian herd
 <cit> . there are about  <dig> million cattle heads in brazil and most of them  are zebu animals and their crossbreds
 <cit> . over the past decades, there has been an increased interest to use genetically evaluated animals in the zebu population. as a consequence, several genetic evaluation programs of zebu breeds exist, particularly for nellore cattle. the main focus of these programs is growth and conformation traits, which are used as selection criteria
 <cit> .

the breeding value of animals can be obtained from genomic data by marker-assisted selection covering the whole genome, also called genomic selection
 <cit> . genomic selection explores the linkage disequilibrium  between markers, assuming that the effects of chromosome segments will be the same in the whole population since the markers are in ld with genes that are responsible for expression of the trait . therefore, the density of markers should be sufficiently high to guarantee that all qtl are in ld with a marker or with a marker haplotype. the ld maps are important tools for exploring the genetic basis of economically important traits in cattle. likewise, comparison of ld maps permits to establish the diversity between cattle breeds with different biological attributes and to identify genome regions that were subject to different selection pressures
 <cit> .

the two measures most commonly used to evaluate ld between biallelic markers are r <dig> and |d'|
 <cit> . these parameters can vary between  <dig> and  <dig>  a value of |d'| <  <dig> indicates the occurrence of recombination between two loci, and |d'| =  <dig> indicates the lack of recombination between two loci. one disadvantage of |d'| is that it tends to be strongly overestimated in small samples and in the presence of rare or low-frequency alleles. the r <dig> parameter represents the correlation between two loci and is preferred in association studies since an inverse relationship exists between r <dig> and the size of the sample needed for the same detection power. linkage disequilibrium is necessary to detect associations between a qtl and a marker
 <cit> .

the ld between markers has been studied in the genome of taurine breeds. in this respect,
 <cit>  analyzing  <dig> snps located on chromosome  <dig> of holstein cattle, reported moderate levels of ld  for markers separated by less than  <dig> kb. similar results have been reported by
 <cit>  who estimated the ld  between  <dig>  markers in eight cattle breeds. villa-angulo et al., 2009
 <cit>  studied the genomes of  <dig> taurine and zebu breeds using a set of  <dig>  snps. the authors observed that zebu breeds have a higher proportion of low-frequency alleles and a lower level of ld than taurine breeds. recently,
 <cit>  genotyped  <dig> gyr bulls using a panel of  <dig>  markers  and obtained a mean ld  between adjacent markers of  <dig> .

the first step necessary to determine the number of markers required for qtl mapping and genomic selection is the quantification of the extent of ld in the cattle genome. therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate ld in nellore cattle using a high density snp panel .

RESULTS
the results of descriptive statistics of the snp markers and ld  between synthetic adjacent markers obtained for each autosome are shown in table 
 <dig>  a total of  <dig>   markers met the filtering criteria and were included in the final analysis. this sub-set of markers comprised  <dig> . <dig> mb of the genome, with a mean distance between markers of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kb. the snps were uniformly distributed across all autosomes since the marker density was similar for all chromosomes, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb . the autosomes differed in size, with bta <dig> being the shortest chromosome  and bta <dig> the longest .

snp: single-nucleotide polymorphism; maf: minor allele frequency; sd: standard deviation. 1data in the table is based on the umd  <dig>  assembly. 

after filtering of the snp data, maf <  <dig>  were observed in a considerable proportion of snps . similar results have been reported by
 <cit>  and
 <cit>  for zebu breeds. however, the mean maf obtained in the present study  was slightly higher than that reported by
 <cit>  for nellore cattle  and by the bovine hapmap consortium using the illumina bovine snp50k beadchip for nellore cattle 
 <cit> . according to
 <cit> , the threshold for maf affects the distribution and extent of ld. chromosomes bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig> and bta <dig> presented a higher proportion of minor alleles , whereas chromosomes bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig> and bta <dig> presented a lower proportion of minor alleles .

all possible snp pairs on the same chromosome separated by ≤  <dig> kb produced  <dig> , <dig> combinations of snp pairs to estimate ld across the  <dig> autosomes. the overall mean ld between marker pairs measured by r <dig> and |d'| was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. silva et al., 2010
 <cit>  genotyped  <dig> gyr sires using a panel of  <dig>  markers  and obtained a mean ld between adjacent markers measured by r <dig> and |d'| of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the present results and those reported in previous studies confirm that the |d'| parameter overestimates ld, especially in cases of low maf.

the mean ld between adjacent snps across autosomes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for r <dig> and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for |d'| . silva et al., 2010
 <cit>  reported slightly higher values for gyr cattle, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for r <dig> and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for |d'|, respectively. lower levels of ld  were estimated for chromosomes bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig> and bta <dig>  this relatively low level of ld obtained for these chromosomes is in contrast to findings previously published for zebu breeds
 <cit> . according to
 <cit> , there is a wide variation in autosomal recombination rates, a fact, among others, that leads to marked diversity in the pattern of ld in different genomic regions. however, the results obtained in this study for bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig> and bta <dig> can probably be attributed to a sampling variation since the number of markers, marker density, mean maf or proportion of maf did not differ from the other autosomes studied.

to analyze the decline in ld according to physical distance between markers, synthetic snp pairs were classified into intervals  based on the distance between markers and mean values of r <dig> and |d'| were estimated for each bin per autosome  and for the whole genome . the ld decreased with increasing physical distance between markers . in contrast to this clear decrease of ld measured by r <dig>  the changes in |d'| indicated a less pronounced decline of ld . moderate levels of r <dig>  were observed at distances <  <dig> kb. when the distance between markers increased from  <dig> to  <dig> kb, the mean r <dig> value decreased from  <dig>  to  <dig> . a high variability in r <dig> estimates was observed for marker distances of more than  <dig> kb. markers showing ld  higher than  <dig>  and  <dig>  had an average spacing of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively. however, not all markers with a spacing of  <dig> to  <dig> kb presented an r <dig> value higher than  <dig> . for distances of less than  <dig> kb, the proportion of markers with an r <dig> >  <dig>  and >  <dig>  ranged from  <dig> to 57% and from  <dig> to 42%, respectively. this proportion was lower than that reported by
 <cit>   for markers spacing from  <dig> to  <dig>  mb, who genotyped  <dig> sires using  <dig>  snps and the same threshold  for ld . recently,
 <cit>  genotyped  <dig> holstein cattle using the illumina bovine snp50k panel and found that, for snps separated by less than  <dig> kb, the proportion of those in ld  >  <dig>  was 29%.

snp: single-nucleotide polymorphism; sd: standard deviation. 1percentage of snp pairs with r <dig> >  <dig> , r <dig> >  <dig>  and |d'| >  <dig> .

except for autosomes bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig> and bta <dig>  the level of ld  was higher than  <dig>  for markers separated by less than  <dig> kb, and higher than  <dig>  for markers separated by less than  <dig> kb. for marker distances higher than  <dig> kb, the level of ld  decreased from  <dig>   to  <dig>   . mckay et al., 2007
 <cit>  estimated the ld between all marker pairs  in eight cattle breeds  and reported a mean ld  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for a physical distance of  <dig> kb between adjacent markers.

in the present study, certain autosomes presented higher ld than others. in addition, when autosomes with low levels of ld  were excluded , a linear relationship was observed between chromosome length and ld , i.e., the level of ld increased with increasing chromosome size. according to
 <cit> , recombination rates decrease as the length of the chromosome increases. in a recent study,
 <cit>  found no association between chromosome size and level of ld. however, these authors used a bos taurus cattle population and a much lower marker density.

the use of snp pairs with low allele frequencies tends to underestimate ld. polymorphisms with high allele frequencies are thus preferred for a less biased estimation of ld
 <cit> . we therefore analyzed the effect of maf on the estimates of |d'| and r <dig> . the ld  between markers was higher when the maf threshold was high , particularly when the distance between markers was short . yan et al., 2009
 <cit> , genotyping  <dig> maize lines using  <dig>  snp markers, showed that the ld  between markers increased with increasing maf threshold, especially in the case of very close snp pairs . for adjacent markers , the |d'| remained unchanged for different maf thresholds . for more distant markers, the |d'| was lower as the maf threshold increased. according to
 <cit> , the ld measured by |d'| is underestimated as the maf threshold increases . when ld is determined by |d'|, the denominator in the formula is the product between allele frequencies. thus, in the case of snp pairs with low allele frequencies, d' will be divided by a small number, resulting in a large value for |d'|
 <cit> . the results of the present study indicate a considerable variation in the magnitude and pattern of ld in the nellore genome. as a consequence, two markers that are very close may show a low level of ld, whereas more distant markers may show a higher level of ld than expected. this variation is probably due to different recombination rates between and within chromosomes, heterozygosity, genetic drift, and effects of selection
 <cit> .

the level of ld between adjacent markers  observed in the present study was lower than that reported in other studies on bos taurus cattle and similar to that found in studies using bos indicus. the differences between taurine and indicine breeds decrease for markers separated by  <dig> to  <dig> kb. however, it is generally difficult to compare the level of ld obtained in different studies because of differences in sample size, measures of ld, type of markers and marker density, as well as because of the recent history of the population
 <cit> . nevertheless, differences between indicine and taurine cattle that occurred during the historical process of domestication and selection and as a consequence of the effective size of populations seem to explain the discrepancy in ld at short distances between markers
 <cit> . another reason is the fact that bos indicus populations present a higher proportion of low-frequency alleles in the hd snp chip than bos taurus populations which, in turn, influences ld estimates
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the level of ld estimated for markers separated by less than  <dig> kb indicates that the high density bovine snp beadchip will likely be a suitable tool for prediction of genomic breeding values in nellore cattle. further studies investigating the magnitude of ld in a larger sample of animals from this population are needed to confirm the estimates obtained here.
