BACKGROUND
there are two economically important tetraploid cultivated species of cotton, gossypium hirsutum  and g. barbadense . they display many complementary agronomic features. g. hirsutum , the most widely cultivated species, has higher yield potential than g. barbadense  in most environments; however, gb cultivars are superior to gh in most aspects of fiber quality, such as fiber length, strength and fineness. the two species are derived from a recent polyploidization event that occurred ~1- <dig> mya  <cit> . they are inter-fertile, but inter-specific crosses aimed at recombination of of genes underlying their complementary agronomic performance have generally resulted in difficulties such as reduced fertility, cytological abnormalities and distorted segregation in the f  <dig> generation. although inter-specific breeding by conventional approaches has had positive impacts on cultivar development  <cit> , the potential for using molecular markers to facilitate more rapid and effective selection and transfer of g. barbadense fiber properties to g. hirsutum  <cit>  is clear.

cotton fibers are highly elongated single cells of the epidermal layer of the seed. fiber development spans four discrete, yet overlapping stages: initiation , elongation , secondary cell wall deposition  and maturation/dehydration   <cit> . the final mature spinnable fibers are dried flattened cylinders ~35- <dig> mm long and made of ~96% cellulose. their commercial value is determined by their overall physical dimensions and the extent of thickening of the internal walls. various physical properties of cotton fibers are measured ranging from fiber length and length uniformity, strength, elongation , maturity , micronaire  and fineness , to color indices . the most commonly used equipment, high volume instrument , is used for commercial and research applications for high-throughput measurements of most of these parameters, while research programs also rely on specialized instruments like fibronaire, maturimeter or the advanced fiber information system   <cit> . an optimal fiber quality results from the composite association of numerous partially correlated quantitative traits all impacting on the final performance of the fiber in spinning and weaving and relatively small differences in fiber parameters can attract premiums or penalties during marketing.

earlier genetic studies demonstrated fairly high heritabilities of fiber characteristics, in excess of  <dig> , except for length uniformity  <cit> , and moderate environment and gxe effects . more than  <dig> reports have been published on genetic mapping and qtl mapping in inter-specific gh × gb populations, of which  <dig>  originating from  <dig> different populations, relate to qtl data for fiber traits. these studies represent a total of over  <dig> qtls  <cit> . a common feature of most of these qtl studies is that positive effects on all fiber traits are derived from the presence of alleles from both gh and gb parents  <cit>  commonly resulting in transgressive segregation  <cit> .

comparison between different qtl studies in cotton is generally complicated by insufficient marker synteny between maps and the lack of sufficient bridge markers. however, an overall observation is that the level of congruence of qtl localization is generally low. only two qtl reports have included a comparison across populations. the study by lacape et al.  <cit> , focusing on  <dig> backcross generations  × vh8- <dig> ), reported  <dig> significant fiber qtls . only 20% of the qtls were common between at least  <dig> of the  <dig> bc data sets and only 30% putatively agreed with at least one qtl report in the literature for both chromosomal location and parental species origin. rong et al.  <cit>  aligned  <dig> fiber qtls from  <dig> different inter-specific gh × gb populations using the palmeri x k101-f <dig>  map as a reference. these authors concluded that there was a poor level of correspondence of fiber qtls between experiments and populations. inter-specific chromosome substitution lines , so called cs-b lines, have been employed to assign genetic effects  on fiber traits to specific chromosomes or chromosome arms  <cit> , although correlations with other qtl studies were not undertaken.

although the number of reports on qtl mapping of agronomically important traits in plants has increased tremendously in the past  <dig> years, several authors have also emphasized limitations and biases of qtl mapping that have limited their broad application to marker-assisted breeding in many crops. it appears that numerous "resource-limited" qtl studies may be questionable in terms of their reliability and accuracy, major limitations being the number of genotypes and number of environments under study  <cit> . such limitations will be inflated for traits of low to moderate heritability or for traits with significant qtl x environment interactions  <cit> . a way of improving the power and accuracy in detection of true qtls is by increasing population sizes , or by multiplying the number of environments in which the population is evaluated . one option would be to reanalyze raw data in a pooled analysis  <cit> , but this approach is generally prohibitive because of different data structures and requirement for a common set of markers across populations.

comparative qtl mapping and meta-analysis, however, provides another means to unify, and thereby simplify molecular analysis of complex phenotypes across multiple data sets. meta-analysis aims to study qtl congruency. results are pooled across studies in order to combine them in a single result, thus improving estimate in qtl detection  <cit> . meta-analysis of qtls has mainly been reported in medical and animal sciences  <cit> . examples in plants include nematode resistance in soybean  <cit> , disease resistance traits in cocoa  <cit> , drought-related traits in rice  <cit>  and ear emergence in wheat  <cit> . the report on cotton by rong et al.  <cit>  concerned yield and fiber traits gathered from diverse qtl mapping reports that were collectively projected onto a reference map. these studies essentially used biomercator software  <cit> , that has recently been followed by a new computational and statistical package, metaqtl  <cit> . metaqtl has been used for the meta-analysis of qtls for flowering time  <cit>  and n-remobilization in maize  <cit> , fhb resistance in wheat  <cit> , and root architecture in rice  <cit> .

in this study, we evaluated the fiber characteristics of a population of inter-specific gh × gb rils in eleven independent experiments involving both field and glasshouse conditions, different locations and multiple years. the two parents used for the ril population were the same as those being currently used in marker-assisted backcross selection underway at cirad to enhance the fiber quality of gh breeding material  <cit> . a meta-analysis was undertaken with metaqtl using the fiber qtls derived from the eleven experimental sites of the ril population, fiber qtls previously reported in backcross populations, and fiber qtls from the literature, in order to identify highly congruent genomic regions contributing to key fiber quality traits.

RESULTS
trait variation
summary data of the  <dig> experiments and the fiber trait values for the parents and rils are given in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  respectively. among the  <dig> fiber data sets,  <dig> were collected from glasshouse grown plants and  <dig> from field-grown plants . although field-grown samples as compared to glasshouse samples may be expected to be more representative of real commercial growing conditions, they may also be more prone to environmental variation. the  <dig> types of growing conditions were therefore not specifically separated in all further analyses. the two parents, guazuncho- <dig>  and vh8- <dig>  display a broad range of phenotypes in many aspects of plant growth and development  as well as fiber quality parameters , making them suitable for discriminating the underlying genetic contributions to fiber quality in genetic crosses. the fibers of the gb parent were intrinsically very fine , but their maturity and micronaire measures were usually very low . as expected, the rils displayed a high degree of variability at all sites and for every descriptor of plant phenology , morphology , and production components , but also showed frequent segregation beyond parental variability, or transgression, for those parameters . variation among the rils was also considerable for all fiber quality parameters . although the mean ril values  were always closer to the gh parent value than to the gb parent, there were always some individual rils displaying transgression on both sides of the distribution for most traits, as shown by the maximum and minimum values in table  <dig>  the ranking of individual rils for fiber characteristics showed good consistency among sites, indicative of moderate gxe interaction effects and high heritabilities for fiber traits, as described below.

fiber fineness components of the rils in particular, displayed a wide range of variation. fiber maturity was considerably improved in the ril material, relative to the mid-parent value, with an average level close to that of guazuncho- <dig> . in addition to their large variation, fiber length traits  were the parameters for which the mean ril values were the most biased toward the gh parent. fiber of the rils was on average  <dig> mm longer  than that of the gh parent, although the  <dig> parents differed by more than  <dig> mm. fiber strength displayed transgression in some rils, as exemplified by the extreme high  <dig>  g/tex  for one ril in experiment garoua  <dig> . regarding the two color parameters, the parents only displayed moderate differences  and the variation over the rils largely exceeded the parental range in both yellowness and reflectance.

analysis of variance, trait heritabilities and correlations
a separate analysis of variance of the fiber data collected from the two brazilian experiments of  <dig> and  <dig> was conducted. the  <dig> randomized blocks design used in each year constituted a balanced data set with a sufficiently high number of individuals  to allow a statistical estimate of gxe compared with some of the other sites. the environmental  component corresponded to compounded effects of blocks and year. in the case of the global data set, there was a variable number of rils  for which  <dig> to  <dig> individual fiber data were collected from the  <dig> experiments depending on the trait measured. the year and location effects were confounded in the analysis of variance and the gxe effect was not testable. the results of the  <dig> analyses of variance of fiber data are presented in table  <dig>  in the brazil-only analysis, all fiber traits displayed strong  genotype effects and high heritabilities . brazilian data also indicated that half of the fiber quality measures were associated with non significant gxe  effects. when significant , this interaction component was always strongly inferior to the genotypic  effect , confirming data from the literature and indicating that the genetic influence on major fiber characteristics was generally greater than non-genetic influences . as compared to brazil data, it could be assumed that a larger environmental variation had been introduced from the testing over  <dig> sites × years; global estimation of trait heritabilities based on the complete data set resulted in slightly lower values, between  <dig>  for maturity ratio and  <dig>  for yellowness index . these values were generally superior to the narrow sense heritabilities estimated from the bc 2/bc 2s  <dig> regression  <cit>  and fell within the range of reported values from the literature  <cit> . highest heritabilities associated with a non-significant ril × year interaction component for the brazilian data were related to color indices  and to fiber fineness.

* significant at p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> 

analysis of variance were made  in the  <dig> experiments in brazil , and  over the complete  set of  <dig> experimental sites. individual broad sense heritabilities were calculated from the estimates of variance components.

within a trait category, the strongly significant correlations between mean length, ml, and upper half mean length, uhml  or between the  <dig> color parameters, rd and + b  are inherent to the measurement equipment and are well described  <cit> . within the fiber fineness/maturity category,  <dig> parameters were also well correlated: h, mr and im , while the 4th parameter, standard fineness, hs, was the least correlated with the  <dig> others. this can be explained by the fact that hs is calculated as the ratio of h to mr, and is used to compare cottons of very different maturities. there was also a fairly high and positive correlation between mean fiber length and strength , but no significant correlation between fineness and length or fineness and strength, although the  <dig> fiber traits, strength, length and fineness, are phenotypically associated in the  <dig> parents.

qtl analyses of ril data sets
one hundred and sixty seven significant  qtls were detected by composite interval mapping over the  <dig> ril experiments, involving  <dig> individual series of data . the  <dig> significant qtls individually explained  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation, with lod as high as lod =  <dig>  for color qtls on c <dig>  the  <dig> significant qtls were a subset of the larger number of  <dig> putative qtls  which were considered for meta-analysis.

distribution of the  <dig> significant qtls  and of the total  <dig> qtls  from the analysis of the ril phenotypic data and shared among the  <dig> fiber trait categories,  <dig> sites and  <dig> chromosomes.

the number of rils sampled and analyzed for their fiber parameters per location/year ranged from as low as  <dig> for ge <dig> to  <dig> for the br <dig> data set, and the number of fiber traits measured at the different sites also varied . the lowest number of qtls  was detected for cs <dig>  as only fineness components and fiber length were measured at this site because the small fiber quantities generated were insufficient for most fiber measuring instruments. for other data sets , where more fiber parameters were measured, the number of significant qtls per data set varied between  <dig>  and  <dig> .

globally, the largest group of qtls  was related to the fiber fineness/maturity category as this category integrates more variables than any of the others  and includes h, mr, hs, and micronaire. fiber length  and fiber length uniformity  detected  <dig> and  <dig> qtls, respectively. strength and elongation were accounted for by  <dig> and  <dig> qtls, respectively, but were not detected at all sites. fiber color, represented by  <dig> parameters, rd and + b, revealed  <dig> qtls in total.

the number of fiber qtls per chromosome  varied. the lowest numbers of qtls were detected on c <dig>  and c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> , and the highest numbers were detected on c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig>  and c <dig> . a similar number of significant qtls were detected on chromosomes of the a t sub-genome  and the d t sub-genome , with  <dig> and  <dig> significant qtls, respectively .

the parental contribution  for the  <dig> significant qtls was also analyzed. in a commercial context, high values of length, strength, elongation, maturity or reflectance are sought by fiber merchants and spinners, while low values of fineness and yellowness are favored. in our inter-specific cross, the gh parent, guazuncho- <dig> is expected to be the donor for slightly better fiber color properties as well as for fiber elongation, while the gb parent, vh8- <dig>  is expected to be the donor for all other parameters, including the most commercially important ones, length, strength and fineness. from our qtl data, we observed that the relative contribution of the  <dig> parents was sometimes "as expected" with more qtls having a positive contribution from the predicted donor parent, as was the case for fiber elongation , fiber color  and fineness . however, in the case of fiber strength and length the situation was reversed, as the donor parent vh8- <dig>  contributed positively at less qtls than guazuncho- <dig> .

qtl analyses of bc data sets
in total,  <dig> significant qtl  were detected after the re-analysis of the  <dig> bc data sets, bc  <dig>  bc  <dig> and bc 2s  <dig> . this is higher than the  <dig> significant qtls of the original report  <cit> , because the three generations were considered separately here, while the qtls reported earlier were derived from pooled data. details of these qtls  were, however, only moderately altered as compared to the initial report  <cit> . using a relaxed threshold there were  <dig> putative qtls  detected over the three bc generations and these were used in the meta-analysis.

comparative qtl analysis and primary meta-analysis
qtl analyses of fiber data from the  <dig> ril experiments and  <dig> backcross generations altogether generated  <dig> significant qtls  and  <dig> qtls . visual inspection indicated a moderate level of transferability between ril and bc data sets. the highest frequency of conserved qtls from ril and/or bc data sets mapping at close distance were encountered for fiber color on c <dig> involving  <dig>  of the  <dig> data sets where it was measured, for length on c <dig> and fineness on c <dig> and c <dig> , for fiber color on c <dig> , for fiber length on c <dig> . these regions of conserved qtls were only identified at the lower detection threshold  and therefore mainly comprise putative qtls. conversely, some strong qtls were found to be specifically detected in only a limited number of situations. for example, strength qtls on c <dig> with strong effects were only detected in the bc populations, but none were detected in the ril experiments. two possible factors may account for these differences between bc and ril:  population structure and heterozygosity , and  environmental interactions  including intrinsic measurement variability .

in addition to qtls from the ril and bc data, fiber qtls reported by  <cit>  were also projected onto the ril-bc consensus map. in all, the qtlproj module of metaqtl was used to project over  <dig> qtls onto the consensus map, including all  <dig> qtls of the bc data, all except  <dig> of the  <dig> qtls of the ril data and  <dig> of the  <dig> qtls from rong et al.  <cit> . the  <dig> ril qtls that could not be projected  may be due to minor remaining map inconsistencies in some terminal regions between the ril map and the consensus map.

the graphical representations of the projections of fiber qtls for the  <dig> chromosomes are presented in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  with an example, chromosome  <dig>  shown in figure  <dig> 

the one-lod confidence interval  was used as the primary screen to identify a limited number of chromosome regions with consistent localization for meta-analysis  <cit> . for a given chromosome and for a given fiber trait category, the presence of qtls from at least  <dig>  independent data sets mapping anywhere on the same chromosome was considered as the cutoff for clustering with the qtlclust module of metaqtl. thirty chromosome regions were chosen, and in each case the best clustering model based on aic criterion was then implemented and clusters generated by metaqtl. nearly half  of the qtls served as input data for the meta-analysis, resulting in  <dig> clusters on  <dig> different chromosomes. the seven other chromosomes  did not show sufficient qtl co-localization for any fiber trait to warrant clustering. an example of the clustering output is shown in figure  <dig> for the  <dig> qtls related to fiber length detected on chromosome  <dig>  detailed clustering results are shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> and summarized in table  <dig>  output figures generated by metaqtl for all  <dig> trait x chromosome combinations are shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  with corresponding text comments in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  despite an acceptable level of representation among the data sets, some of the combinations listed in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  were qualified as still only indicative because there was sometimes a poor level of co-localization and consequently high numbers of putative clusters were generated by metaqtl. we decided to be conservative with these few cases because of the possible uncertainty in the mapping data, whereby markers  could be erroneously mapped at distant locations.

prioritization among clusters and proposals for meta-clusters
the qtl meta-analysis relied strongly upon the fact that the ci of proposed co-localizing lod peaks were overlapping. we used the one-lod drop off method for calculation of ci. considering the inherent limits related to the notion of ci  and the possible uncertainties in the locus order and distances in genetic maps, we also tested an alternative, formula-based method for ci calculation  <cit> . all clustering analyses were re-run with metaqtl and clustering results with new formula-based ci were found to differ. the much larger individual ci with the formula-based method  most often resulted in a lower number of clusters that also had larger ci . apart from the effect of the method of calculation of the ci, it is also expected that mapping errors and uncertainties in mapping will have a strong effect on lod peak and ci positioning. for these reasons, we believe that in some cases the identification of separate clusters by metaqtl software could be questioned. in several instances, we have proposed that multiple clusters mapping at fairly close distances and containing individual qtl for which ci essentially overlapped and with the condition that their individual additivity agreed, be coalesced and collectively referred-to as candidate "meta-clusters" . most prominent examples of such meta-clusters were found for fiber color on c <dig> and c <dig>  length on c <dig>  fineness on c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> or for strength on c <dig>  applying a prioritization among clusters and meta-clusters we identified a total of  <dig> robust cases , listed in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  and mapped to  <dig> different chromosomes, shared between  <dig> for fiber fineness,  <dig> for length,  <dig> for strength,  <dig> for color and  <dig> for elongation. the higher representation of fiber fineness as compared to other categories may reflect the inherent complex nature of fiber fineness as it includes two fairly independent interacting components  that are not separated by the measurement devices used. regarding fiber strength, only  <dig> significant qtls  and  <dig> clusters , on c <dig> and c <dig>  were detected. an issue here may be in the reliability of the hvi-based measurement of fiber strength within the range of values that occurred in the rils. considering that micronaire reading is used by the hvi to estimate fiber plug mass and convert breakage force to g/tex , it might be important to bear in mind that the parent vh8- <dig> and a number of rils had an extremely low micronaire reading  and this could cause a biased estimation of bundle strength.

in the majority of cases  the directionality of the additive effect followed the expectation in relation to the parental phenotypes : improved trait values were contributed by the gh parent for the  <dig> fiber color and  <dig> fiber elongation meta-clusters and by the gb parent for  <dig> fiber strength meta-clusters, for  <dig> of the  <dig> fiber fineness clusters and for  <dig> of the  <dig> length meta-clusters. a positive contribution by the inferior parent was also reported in the case of fiber length in  <cit>  for 61%  of their non over-lapping fiber length qtls. this effect may explain the marked occurrence of transgressive segregation.

from these  <dig> robust cases,  <dig> may be considered of higher significance based on additional consistency evidence  both from our data and data from the literature:

-  <dig> clusters or meta-clusters for fiber length on c <dig> and c4

-  <dig> clusters or meta-clusters for fiber fineness on c <dig>  and c <dig>  and on c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> 

-  <dig> clusters or meta-clusters for fiber color on c <dig>  and of c <dig>  and c <dig> 

discussion
the two gossypium species used in this study represented highly divergent genotypes and were purposely selected as parents for hybridization to both maximize the chances of detecting significant qtls for all fiber traits and to produce material that might have value as a source of variation for breeding. because of their interspecific origin, some of the rils showed reduced fertility and productivity resulting in the poor representation of data from some lines and sites . another contributing factor for the poor performance of the rils could be that most of the experimental sites were outside of south-central america, the area of adaptation of the two parents.

the averaged fiber characteristics of the rils were always intermediate between the  <dig> parents, but closer to the gh parent than to the gb parent . this is in accordance with the observed distorted allelic constitution of most of the rils, that contained on average 71% and 29% of alleles of gh and gb, respectively  <cit> . some individual rils displayed fiber characteristics outside of the parental range  and may thereby provide useful material to include in breeding crosses. interestingly, the parental allelic composition of the rils, varying between 95/ <dig> to 32/ <dig> parental  allelic content, showed no correlation with fiber quality: the best performing rils were not those having the highest allelic content in vh8- <dig> alleles.

complex qtl networks determine cotton fiber quality
the quantitative variation in the fiber characteristics observed over  <dig>  ril experiments did convert into a high number of qtls. including the  <dig> significant fiber qtls from the rils, ca  <dig> fiber qtls have been collectively reported so far from  <dig> different inter-specific gh × gb populations. although we have reported some stability in qtl detection among this high number of fiber qtls, the overall complex picture behind fiber qtl mapping may be put into perspective with the fact that fiber quality is assessed by a series of fairly independent physical measurements, essentially related to dimensional features like diameter, thickness and length. the complex genetic network is also consistent with biological evidence that cotton fiber development involves many genes  and gene interactions.

meta-analysis shows  clustering
although earlier published comparative qtl mapping studies concluded that there was a poor level of transferability of qtls between populations  <cit> , it was expected that at least the strongest fiber qtls would be confirmed, thus hopefully reducing the number of relevant qtls  <cit>  to a more manageable level from a breeder's perspective. the four populations studied here  only revealed a moderate level of convergence across data sets. regarding the ril experiments, the differences in the qtls detected among the  <dig> sites probably resulted from the low number of individual rils examined in some ril experiments. the most important limiting factor causing reduced accuracy of detection of qtls probably relates to the range of different population sizes used in the current study  <cit>  rather than to the effect of environment, because heritabilities of fiber traits were shown to be medium to high. another factor negatively affecting qtl detection power was the distorted genomic composition of the ril population.

for these reasons, a fairly low detection threshold  was used to declare lod peaks as putative qtls for use in across-experiment comparisons. previous experience in qtl interval mapping has indicated that it is common for "background" noise in lod score profiles to occur in the range of lod values between  <dig> and  <dig>  figure  <dig> provides an example of the usefulness of lowering the lod detection threshold for qtl detection in the particular context of such across-experiment comparisons. in the case of the  <dig> independent series of fiber length measurements and their lod profiles along chromosome  <dig>  only  <dig> significant qtls having a lod superior to the permutation-based threshold  would have been declared in a bottom region of c <dig>  however, when a lower lod threshold is used ,  <dig> additional "putative" qtls  would be integrated in the meta-analysis. in this particular case, the reduction of the lod detection threshold to lod <dig> would even have allowed  <dig> additional locations to be included . lowering detection thresholds also had some deleterious effects and probably resulted in significant inflation of qtl numbers, particularly by splitting broader peaks into multiple peaks in close proximity, as well as the probable inclusion of some false positives.

consistency with previously reported fiber qtls
the bc and ril populations included in meta-qtl analysis had the same gh and gb parents . when possible, we compared our results with fiber qtls reported from different crosses in the literature, for which the map locations on our bc-ril consensus map could be extrapolated. interestingly, for at least  <dig> of the  <dig> prioritized clusters and meta-clusters, additional support was provided by the reported localization on the same chromosome of at least one qtl from the literature, of which  <dig> also agreed in their directionality . the cases of contradiction in directionality  may relate to real differential allelic effects as the parents differed. in a few cases, qtls reported in the literature were not detected in this study. the strong fiber strength qtl reported from cross tm <dig> x  <dig> by zhang et al.  <cit>  localized on c24/d <dig>  near locus bnl <dig>  and presumably originating from the g. anomalum and g. barbadense lineages of one of the  <dig> parents, was only corroborated by one putative qtl, lu8_str with peak lod =  <dig>  and higher strength by the gb alleles. a recent intraspecific ril population  <cit>  also reported  <dig> fiber qtls, including a region of co-localization for  <dig> qtls for different fiber traits on c <dig>  but none was corroborated by any of our clusters. similarly, the central region of c <dig> containing the gene t <dig> governing leaf hairiness did not contain any confirmed fiber qtl from our data, although leaf hairiness has been correlated with fiber quality in  <dig> segregating intra-g. hirsutum populations  <cit> . the only putative case of co-localization  with t <dig> was for fiber fineness qtls detected in  <dig> ril data sets, br <dig> and cs <dig>  co-localized with a fineness qtl from the literature, ff <dig>  from paterson et al.  <cit>  . it should also be noted that several fiber qtl reports from the literature could not be considered because of lack of bridge markers and uncertain chromosome assignation; this was the case for most qtls from  <dig> interspecific gh × gb populations  <cit> , and more importantly for the majority of fiber qtls reported from intraspecific g. hirsutum crosses  <cit> .

qtl coincidences for different fiber traits
the coincidence of qtls for different fiber traits in the same genomic region was reported earlier  <cit> . our data based on a larger set of qtls confirmed this observation. in several instances a close co-localization of individual qtls for different types of fiber traits was observed. moreover, in the majority of cases the respective directionality of the groups of qtls agreed with the known phenotypic association in the parents. this may be interpreted in terms of pleiotropy because of the known correlations between fiber parameters, their physical definition or their particular measurement method. although pleiotropic genetic effects may not be overlooked, we would also consider linkage as an explanation for these cases of co-localizations.

subgenome distribution and homoeologous relationships of fiber qtls
the overall distribution of qtls and qtl clusters was not homogenous between chromosomes . although, simply counting numbers of qtls may be misleading, because of correlations between traits under consideration, and possible mis-identification of multiple lod peaks in close vicinity  as separate qtls, it is noteworthy that chromosome  <dig> consistently harbored a higher number of qtls than any other chromosome . the enrichment in fiber qtls on c <dig> was more frequently correlated with a gh additive contribution to fiber traits: higher elongation, length, and strength and lower fineness.

subgenome distribution was equivalent between chromosomes c1-c <dig> of the a t sub-genome and c14-c <dig> of the d t sub-genome, with  <dig> and  <dig> significant qtls , and  <dig> and  <dig> robust meta-clusters respectively . the extant wild d-genome diploids, including the modern species g. raimondii, recognized as the closest to the d-genome ancestor of polyploid cotton, only have very short and coarse non-spinnable trichomes on their seed. thus, the finding that the d t-genome of tetraploid a td t cotton contributed at least half of the qtls  involved in fiber quality raises the possibility that homoeologous fiber-related genes have differentially evolved following polyploid formation  <cit> . recent reports tend to confirm an unequal homoeologous gene expression pattern in allopolyploid cottons  <cit>  leading to a differential expression of duplicated genes during fiber development  <cit>  .

meta-clusters generally mapped at non-homoeologous a t/d t locations. the only possible homoeologies for qtl-enriched regions with same directionality included two regions, though only indicative, for fineness along the upper half of pair c5/c <dig> already identified by rong et al.  <cit> , and two new potentially homoeologous regions  along central regions of pair c6/c <dig> both mapping fiber color qtls .

the chromosomal regions enriched in fiber qtls were compared with the chromosome regions statistically enriched in fiber-expressed genes reported by xu et al.  <cit> . these authors used available mapping data for cotton est unigenes from diverse libraries to assess their distribution among chromosomes. they identified a limited number of gene-rich regions: two regions at the top and the center of c <dig>  a central region in each of c <dig> and c <dig>  and a top region on c <dig>  cross comparison of these regions with our clusters for fiber qtls indicated only  <dig> cases of putative convergence. a region at the top of c <dig>  was over-represented in fiber "initiation" genes  <cit>  and enriched in fiber length and fiber fineness qtls . both fiber traits were consistent for a gh positive effect , but the clustering was unreliable. secondly, a central region of c <dig>  was enriched in "elongation" genes  <cit>  and possibly corresponded with a meta-cluster region for fiber fineness, fin_ <dig>  consistent for a gb positive effect . it should be borne in mind that genes classified as "expressed in cotton fibers", as in  <cit> , may not necessarily match with the genes that underlie the fiber qtls reported here. the subset of genes with known differential expression patterns between gh and gb may be more likely candidates for co-localization with fiber qtl. in this context, two recently published studies specifically focused on differences between gh and gb at the transcriptional level using microarrays. alabady et al.  <cit>  showed that on average  <dig> % of the  <dig> fiber genes profiled were specifically and differentially regulated between pima  and tm <dig>  developing fibers. in another study, al-ghazi et al.  <cit>  showed only few gh/gb differences in gene expression except at early stage of fiber development  as compared to later stages .

CONCLUSIONS
a challenging issue for bridging the gap between qtl mapping and identification of the underlying causative dna polymorphisms is the low resolution associated with qtl mapping. over the past years qtl mapping has resulted in the identification of thousands of chromosomal regions predicted to be involved in many complex traits. however, only in a few examples has it been possible to clone the genes that underlie the traits  <cit> . although our results on cotton fiber can hardly support the optimistic assumption that "qtl are accurate"  <cit> , we have shown that the reliability of qtl-calls and the estimated trait impact can be improved by integrating more replicates into the analysis. it should, however, be emphasized that segregating populations of larger sizes than the ones that have so far been reported , including our own rils, will be needed in order to improve the detection power of qtls  <cit> , and this is particularly true in the context of phenotypic traits of complex inheritance like cotton fiber quality. in cotton, particularly with the inter-specific crosses that are needed to access the higher levels of dna polymorphism that occurs between gossypium species, this is sometimes difficult to achieve. the  <dig> rils analyzed here were the end result of ssd from over  <dig> original f  <dig> plants with large numbers dropping out at each generation due to low fertility or extremely late flowering. meta-analysis of qtls was shown to be useful for identifying robust qtls, but it is not a substitute for large population sizes. it will be important in the future, that new fiber qtls plotted on new maps sharing common markers with our consensus map be verified for their agreement with the regions of convergence identified here.

in term of practical applications, the relatively small number of candidate regions hosting fiber qtl meta-clusters that were identified here will facilitate molecular breeding strategies like marker-assisted backcrossing.

on the other hand, different avenues may also be followed to identify the genes underlying strongest qtls. positional cloning of qtls has been the major route in plant qtl dissection  <cit> , and examples in the literature are increasing, although practical interest for really complex traits remains to be shown. in addition to classical phenotypic qtl information from segregating populations, qtls may also be resolved through association mapping of targeted candidate genes, based on an assumption that the allelic polymorphism of the gene is associated with the variation of the trait and provided that linkage disequilibrium is sufficient  <cit> . alternatively, the use of segregating populations for expression qtl  mapping and the correlative observation of the variation of transcript abundance with the variation of the phenotypic traits  <cit>  can also provide a complementary way to resolve complexity of phenotypic qtls. this approach using a segregating population and combining genetics  and genomics , also referred as genetical genomics  <cit> , is underway using the same ril population  <cit> . finally, the dissection of some of these specific regions, could proceed by determining the physical position of associated markers and by linking it with synteny-based information for example from arabidopsis as was attempted by rong et al.  <cit> , at least until the cotton genome is sequenced.
