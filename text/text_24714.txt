BACKGROUND
clenbuterol is a β2-adrenergic receptor agonist that is labeled for use in the management of horses affected with airway obstruction. clenbuterol, a moderately selective β2-adrenergic receptor agonist, causes relaxation of airway smooth muscle by binding to the receptor and activating adenylyl cyclase. activation of adenylyl cyclase leads to an increase in intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate  and ultimately activation of protein kinase a . in the airways this inhibits smooth muscle contraction by opening k+ channels and down-regulating myosin light chain kinase activity  <cit> .

β2-adrenergic agonists are also known to promote lipolysis and increase muscle mass in many species . this repartitioning effect and improvement in muscle growth efficiency has led to the addition of β2-adrenergic agonists such as ractopamine and zilpaterol to feed products for production animals. while not approved for use as a growth-promoting agent, by virtue of its mechanism of action, clenbuterol when administered at high doses has been shown to have similar repartitioning effects in many species . since clenbuterol is an approved therapeutic medication that is commonly used in racehorses, regulators have expressed concern regarding its potential to alter body composition in such a way as to affect performance. supporting this concern are reports of decreases in the percent fat and increases in fat-free mass following high dose clenbuterol administration  in horses when combined with intense exercise  <cit> . however, it should be noted that although changes in body mass have been documented in many species, performance is not necessarily improved and in some cases may be hindered  <cit> .

increases in myofibrillar and structural proteins following clenbuterol administration have been well documented for several years . more recently investigators have used gene expression analysis techniques including dna microarray and qrt-pcr to elucidate the underlying mechanism for these changes  <cit> . to date the molecular effects of clenbuterol administration on gene expression have been described in production animals and laboratory animal species  <cit> . spurlock and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated changes in the mrna abundance of multiple genes associated with myogenic differentiation in mice following clenbuterol administration. increases in expression levels of lipid metabolism related genes were demonstrated in pigs following clenbuterol administration  <cit> . investigators speculated that one of these genes, apor, might be critical in reducing fat accumulation  <cit> .

while the effect of high dose clenbuterol on skeletal muscle fiber thickness in the horse has been assessed  <cit> , there are no studies assessing the effects of clenbuterol at the molecular level in this species. therefore, in the current study we chose to use dna technology to assess the changes in skeletal muscle gene expression following high dose administration of clenbuterol to horses. furthermore, studies describing muscle hypertrophy in horses have utilized high doses of the compound  <cit>  and although clenbuterol is labeled for use at doses as high as  <dig>  μg/kg twice a day , a more common therapeutic dosing regimen in performance horses in the united states is chronic low dose  administration. therefore, the primary objective of the current study was to describe clenbuterol-induced temporal changes in gene expression following chronic oral administration of clenbuterol at both high and low doses. we hypothesized that clenbuterol would affect skeletal muscle gene expression , relative to baseline levels, in the horse in a dose dependent manner.

methods
animals, clenbuterol treatment and sampling
twenty-eight healthy, exercised adult thoroughbred horses  were studied. horses used in this study were a combination of university and client owned horses. this study was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee  and the clinical trials committee of the university of california, davis . for client owned horses, written consent was obtained for participation in the study. prior to and throughout the course of the study, horses were exercised five days a week. the general exercise protocol was meant to simulate the strenuous exercise of race training. the exercise regimen for these horses consists of three days per week on an equineciser   and two days per week on a high speed treadmill . all horses were subject to regular fitness testing, including weekly heart rate measurements and calculation of v <dig>  and monthly measurements of end run plasma lactate concentrations, as a means by which to ensure that the fitness level of the horses used in this study were as comparable as possible to the average racehorse.

prior to commencement of the study, all horses were determined healthy and free of cardiovascular diseases by physical examination, complete blood count and a serum biochemistry panel that included aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine phosphokinase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, sorbital dehydrogenase, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. horses did not receive any other medications for at least two weeks prior to conducting this study.

twenty-two of the horses received  <dig>  μg/kg clenbuterol  po bid for 30 days and an additional  <dig> horses received the escalating dosing protocol as described on the manufacturer label for non-responders .

blood samples were collected at time  <dig> and at  <dig>   <dig>  and 45 min, and  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 12 h post administration of the first dose and last dose and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 120 h post administration of the last dose. additionally blood samples were collected every 12 h ) throughout the 30-day dosing period. blood samples were collected by direct venipuncture into edta blood tubes  and were centrifuged at  <dig> × g for 10 min. plasma was immediately transferred into storage cryovials  and stored at −20 ° c until analysis. drug concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry as described previously  <cit> . 

muscle biopsy samples were collected one day prior to administration of the first dose of clenbuterol. additional samples were collected at 48 h and on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> post administration of the first dose. a final sample was collected one-week post administration of the final dose . muscle biopsies were collected at the same time on each sampling occasion which was approximately 3– <dig> h post feeding. horses were not exercised on the day that muscle biopsy samples were collected. for sample collection, horses were sedated with a combination of xylazine  and butorphanol . lidocaine  was administered subcutaneously over the gluteus muscle. a small area over the superficial gluteal muscle was aseptically prepped and a bergstrom biopsy needle  used to collect a small sample . the tissue was transferred to a cryovial containing rnalater  and stored at −20 ° c until processed.

rna extraction and quality assessment
muscle biopsy samples were placed in 600 μl of lysis buffer, contaning 2-β- mercaptoethanol . the tissue sample was then transferred to magna green beads tubes . homogenization was performed using a magnalyse  at 6000 rpm for 30 s followed by a  <dig>  min cool down period. homogenization intervals were continued until pieces of muscle were no longer visible . total rna was purified using an mirneasy mini kit  and following the manufacturer’s instructions. total rna integrity was assessed using the experion automated electrophoresis system . only rna samples with rin ≥  <dig> and 260/ <dig> ratios between  <dig>  and  <dig>  were used  <cit> .

microarray analysis
equine specific microarrays , containing  <dig>  probes representing  <dig>  well-characterized genes were used.

to reduce biological noise as a result of genetic variability, each horse  was analyzed separately and served as their own control for comparison of baseline samples to day  <dig>  or day  <dig> . five biological replicates per time point were tested. purified total rna  was used for cdna synthesis in accordance with the ambion® wt expression assay kit  manufacturer’s protocol. in vitro transcription was used to incorporate biotin labels using the genechip® wt terminal labeling system  and samples hybridized to the equine microarray. arrays were washed and stained on a fluidics station  <dig>  and scanned on a genechip scanner  <dig>  in accordance with manufacturer’s protocols.

the microarrays were evaluated for differential gene expression using transcriptome analysis console  and for hybridization quality control using expression console software . in brief, a total of five cell intensity files were generated per time point, uploaded and normalized under the following conditions: pm -only as a pm intensity adjustment and the robust multichip analysis  quantification method. for evaluation of the assays performance the number of differentially expressed  genes detected between baseline and day  <dig>  or day  <dig>  were assessed. based on the tac software user’s manual, genes with mean transformed ratios significantly less than − <dig> and larger than + <dig> were considered significantly regulated. significant de genes were selected by filtering the genes using an anova . a pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to calculate linear dependence between time point and baseline samples to evaluate the correlation coefficient, where  <dig> was a positive correlation and  <dig> was no correlation. for each probeset, expression at day  <dig>  or day  <dig>  was compared to expression at baseline in the same horse using a paired t-test. fold changes and their confidence intervals were calculated by exponentiating  the mean within-horse difference in expression for each gene and the associated t confidence intervals. p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the false discovery rate  method of benjamini and hochberg  <cit> . analyses were conducted using the statistical software environment r, version  <dig> . <dig> . gene ontology biological process of differently expressed genes of interest was performed using the most recent database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery   <dig>  beta  with the entrez gene id as the primary identifier and equus caballus as the species.

quantification of mrnas using taqman low density arrays 
genes that showed significant changes in expression  following microarray analysis as well as those that have previously been reported to be affected by clenbuterol administration, were chosen as candidate genes for further study. microarray data were validated by measuring the levels of specific mrna in muscle biopsy samples at each time point post clenbuterol administration vs. baseline via taqman low density arrays  which are pre-loaded  <dig> well rt-pcr microfluidic cards.

rna was diluted to a concentration of 2 ng/μl for cdna conversion using the quantitect reverse transcription kit . cdna was then combined with taqman universal mastermix  at a final concentration of 2x and then 100ul of each sample loaded onto the tlda card.

primers for candidate genes were designed and manufactured by life technologies . reference or “housekeeping” genes were used to evaluate the effect of rna integrity on the array and qrt-pcr performance. based on stability across all samples studied  equine beta  <dig> microglobulin  was used as the endogenous control gene to normalize the qrt-pcr data while human 18 s  was used as an internal manufacturing control. each sample was run in quadruplicate with  <dig> candidate genes per card. the tlda cards were then run on a quantstudio™ 12 k flex software v <dig> . <dig> . analysis was performed using expressionsuite software  <dig> . <dig> using singleplex analysis .

statistical analyses using commercially available software  were performed to assess significant differences in expression  between baseline and each time point as well as between the different time points post clenbuterol treatment. data was analyzed using a mixed effects analysis of variance, with the horse treated as a random effect, and with time as fixed effects. post-hoc comparisons were performed with a bonferonni multiple-comparison adjustment to preserve a nominal significance level of  <dig> .

discussion
clenbuterol administration has been associated with changes in body composition including alterations in lipid metabolism and changes in skeletal muscle fibers . numerous studies have shown that these drug-induced alterations are a result of changes at the molecular level, namely changes in mrna expression  <cit> . alterations in body composition, including a significant shift in the myosin heavy chain protein profile  <cit>  and alterations in plasma leptin and adipopnectin concentrations  <cit>  have been reported following clenbuterol administration to horses. however, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report to describe temporal alterations in mrna expression following clenbuterol administration to horses, using  <dig> commonly used dosing regimens.

as a means of providing a global overview of genes affected by clenbuterol administration, microarray analysis, comparing mrna levels prior to drug administration to the levels at 2 weeks  or 4 weeks  post drug administration was used. no significant changes in gene expression were noted following administration of the chronic low dose protocol . conversely, following high dose chronic administration, significant changes were noted in genes coding for select myosin heavy chain isoforms, proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism and the β <dig> adrenergic receptor. the remainder of this discussion pertains to the high dose  regimen.

skeletal muscle fibers
myosins are actin-based motor proteins that function in the generation of mechanical force  <cit>  and are responsible for producing contraction in muscle cells. there are a number of isoforms of myosin heavy chains and fiber type is dependent on the isoform that is present. myosin heavy chains are encoded by a highly conserved multi-gene family and include isoforms such as 2a, 2b and 2x  <cit> . the myh2b gene is not expressed in equine skeletal muscle  <cit> . myosin heavy chain  <dig> is another member of the myosin family found primarily in cardiac but also in skeletal muscle  <cit>  and encoded by the myh <dig> gene.

alterations in the skeletal muscle fiber profile have been described following administration of β <dig> adrenergic agonists, including clenbuterol and ractopamine  <cit> . at the protein level, this most commonly involves a shift from the myh <dig> to the myh2a and 2x fiber type . in the current study, there was not a significant change in either myh <dig> or myh2x gene expression on microarray analysis, therefore, these genes were not selected for further study. in a study similar to the currently reported one, ractopamine was administered to pigs, yielding similar results with respect to myh <dig> expression  <cit> . an apparent lack of agreement between expression of myh transcripts and protein isoforms has been described previously in horses and was attributed to the presence of hybrid fibers  <cit> . additionally, other investigators have theorized that fibers that have more than one myh protein and only one transcript could be a result of fibers converting to the type corresponding to the expressed transcript .

a decrease in myh2a protein levels has been demonstrated in horses following administration of clenbuterol  <cit> . similarly, in the current study, myh2a gene expression was significantly down regulated . this was first observed on day  <dig> and continued throughout the dosing period with maximum effects on expression occurring on  <dig>  this was also the time at which steady state clenbuterol concentrations post the final dose escalation, were achieved, suggesting a dose dependent effect. myh2a levels were not significantly different from baseline at the last time point tested, which was 5 days after termination of dosing, further supporting a dose dependent effect.

genes involved in lipid metabolism
scd is responsible for converting fatty acids into mono-unsaturated fatty acids in mammalian adipocytes  <cit> . up-regulation of the scd gene in skeletal muscle has been associated with abnormal lipid partitioning and obesity in humans and lower levels of scd with a leaner body type  <cit> . β <dig> adrenergic agonists have demonstrated effects on lipid metabolism  <cit> , including down-regulation of scd. this has been demonstrated in pigs following 4 weeks of treatment with ractopamine . in the current study, scd mrna expression decreased starting on day  <dig> and continued until 7 days post clenbuterol administration . this time course is highly suggestive of a dose-dependent effect as no effects on scd were observed following chronic low dose administration . furthermore, following administration of the escalating non-responder dosing regimen, significant effects were not observed until day  <dig>  after significant drug accumulation had occurred.

β2- adrenergic receptor
chronic administration of β2-adrenergic agonists has been associated with down-regulation of the β2-adrenergic receptor in humans  <cit>  and horses  <cit> . in conjunction with this down-regulation, a number of investigators have noted a decrease in β2r mrna  <cit> . decreased levels of β2r mrna has been reported in fast twitch muscle fibers in rats following clenbuterol administration  <cit>  and in pigs following long-term ractopamine administration  <cit> . in the current study, β2r mrna levels were unaffected following low dose clenbuterol administration, however, following administration of the escalating dosing protocol, mrna levels decreased significantly by days  <dig> and  <dig>  abraham and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated a down-regulation of β2-adrenergic receptors following chronic clenbuterol administration and theorized that this provided an explanation for variable sensitivity of horses with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to β2-adrenergic agonists as well as the development of tolerance with long term treatment. similarly in the current study, decreased β2r mrna expression as a result of high dose chronic clenbuterol administration may lead to down-regulation of β2-adrenergic receptors and offer an explanation for the decreased expression of myh, mylk, musk, acd and lpl. by day  <dig> , β2r levels had returned towards baseline levels, presumably due to decreasing concentrations of clenbuterol.

CONCLUSIONS
in the current study, we describe changes in gene expression in skeletal muscle following chronic administration of clenbuterol to horses. changes in gene expression were not noted following administration of therapeutic low doses, however, following chronic administration of high doses of clenbuterol alterations were noted in transcripts encoding various myosin heavy chains, lipid metabolizing enzymes and the β2r.
