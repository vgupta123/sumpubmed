BACKGROUND
the nuclear envelope , which forms the boundary of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells, compartmentalizes nuclear metabolism and helps to organize nuclear structure . it contains an inner  and outer nuclear membrane  separated by the perinuclear lumenal space and joined at nuclear pore complexes , giant supramolecular assemblies that mediate molecular trafficking between the nucleus and the cytosol . the onm is continuous with the peripheral er and in large part, is functionally similar to the latter. in contrast, inm is lined by the nuclear lamina, a meshwork containing a polymer of the lamin intermediate filament proteins as well as other more minor polypeptides, including transmembrane proteins concentrated at the inm . mammals contain  <dig> major lamin subtypes: lamins a and c, which are encoded by alternatively spliced transcripts of the same gene, and lamins b <dig> and b <dig>  which are products of separate genes . lamins b <dig> and b <dig> are expressed in most somatic cells throughout development, whereas lamins a/c usually are expressed only at or following differentiation.

genetic and cell biological studies indicate that the nuclear lamina is a structural scaffold that provides mechanical strength to the nucleus and helps to maintain nuclear shape. the lamina also is involved in tethering chromatin and the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton to the ne , and mounting evidence implicates the lamina in regulation of gene expression  <cit> . the importance of the lamina in cells is emphasized by recent work showing that over  <dig> inherited human diseases  are caused by mutations in lamina components . many laminopathies target specific tissues, most commonly cells of skeletal muscle and heart, adipose tissue, or bone and connective tissue, although progeroid syndromes arising from mutations that target ne proteins affect many cell types.

whereas laminopathies most frequently are caused by mutations in the gene for lamins a/c, human disorders also can arise from mutations in certain transmembrane proteins of the inm. these include emerin, which is linked to emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy, lbr, which is associated with pelger huet anomaly and greenberg skeletal dysplasia, and man <dig>  which is linked to osteopoikilosis and melorheostosis. diseases with the same clinical symptoms can be caused by mutations in either lamins or in inm proteins , emphasizing that some of these proteins have closely linked functions  <cit> .

a number of transmembrane proteins of the inm have been connected to different facets of chromatin regulation and ne function. for example, the inm protein lbr in mammals binds to hp <dig>  <cit> , which is involved in heterochromatin formation. moreover, the mammalian inm proteins lap2β, emerin, and man <dig> all contain a ~ <dig> amino acid α-helical "lem domain"  <cit> . the lem domain binds baf, a dna-binding protein that appears to be involved in chromosome organization and nuclear assembly . moreover, multiple inm proteins, including lem domain proteins, have been found to directly bind to transcriptional regulators . recently, the lem protein man <dig> has been shown to attenuate tfg-β signaling due to its direct interaction with smad transcription factors .

the lamina also has been linked to organization of the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton. pioneering work in c. elegans identified ne transmembrane proteins involved in anchoring the actin cytoskeleton to the ne, including the lamin-interacting unc- <dig> protein of the inm and the actin-binding anc- <dig> protein of the onm  <cit> . homologous proteins have been described in mammalian cells, including sun <dig> of the inm , which interacts in the perinuclear space with an onm protein, nesprin  <dig> giant , which contains an actin-binding domain  <cit> ; reviewed in ref.  <cit> .

conventional cell biological methods have been successful in identifying ~ <dig> transmembrane proteins  that are concentrated at the ne. we recently carried out a large-scale analysis of ne isolated from rodent liver using mudpit proteomics, and identified an additional  <dig> novel putative nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins   <cit> . we found that a randomly selected set of  <dig> of these proteins all target to the ne of cultured cells when expressed by transfection as epitope-tagged fusions  <cit> , confirming that they are authentic nets and suggesting that most members of this group will prove to be ne proteins.

striated muscle is one of the tissues most commonly affected by laminopathy mutations  <cit> . with the goal of understanding this disease association, we have analyzed expression of the novel net genes during differentiation of the murine c2c <dig> skeletal myoblast cell line. extensive precedent from studies of tissue development predicts that nets up-regulated during myoblast differentiation will be important for differentiation and/or for muscle cell maintenance. from this analysis, we identified  <dig> nets that are significantly up-regulated during myogensis. we found that these nets also are highly expressed in mouse muscle, and confirmed that  <dig> of these are authentic ne proteins. based on their sequence homologies, many of these proteins could have roles in signal transduction at the ne.

RESULTS
changes in net expression during c2c <dig> differentiation
we have examined the expression of the novel putative/confirmed nets in mouse c2c <dig> cells during differentiation, as a means of identifying proteins with a potential role in muscle development. c2c <dig> cells are an immortalized myoblast line derived from a stem cell  of adult skeletal muscle involved in muscle regeneration , which expresses the myogenic specification markers myod and myf <dig>  when cultures are shifted to medium containing low serum, the cells withdraw from the cell cycle and ~50–75% of the cell population undergoes differentiation to form multinucleated myotubes  <cit> . the remaining mononucleated cells retain the potential for muscle differentiation upon further culturing  <cit> . differentiation of c2c <dig> cells into muscle involves the induction of "late" myogenic transcriptional regulatory factors including myogenin and mef2c, followed by expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p <dig> and muscle-specific structural proteins including components of myofilaments . we used affymetrix dna microarray analysis to compare the transcript levels of the novel putative/confirmed nets in proliferating c2c <dig> cells vs. differentiated populations examined  <dig> days after shift to low serum medium . of the  <dig> nets described in our proteomics analysis,  <dig> could be analyzed with the affymetrix mouse genome  <dig> v <dig>  microarray chip used. additional file  <dig> provides an updated description of the original  <dig> nets identified in our proteomics analysis, including homology regions identified by blast searches of the most recent pfam, smart and ncbi cog databases. it also lists the different probe-sets on the affymetrix  <dig> v <dig>  chip that recognized each of the  <dig> net genes detected, and the primers used for analysis of certain transcripts by rt-pcr .

a substantial fraction of the putative/confirmed nets showed significant changes in their transcript level  in differentiated c2c <dig> cultures, as compared to proliferating cells . there was a significant increase in the transcript level of  <dig> of the nets , a significant decrease in the level of  <dig> of the nets, and no substantial change for the rest. many of the well-characterized lamina proteins showed a significant decrease in their transcript level in the differentiated c2c <dig> cultures, as compared to the proliferating cells . down-regulated transcripts included those for the  <dig> lamin subtypes and for the transmembrane proteins nurim, lap <dig>  emerin and lbr. conversely, there was a significant increase in the transcript level of the transmembrane protein sun <dig> . the levels were not significantly changed for the remaining proteins, including man <dig>  lap1b and luma. as expected, the transcript level increased substantially for several markers of terminal myogenic differentiation including desmin , mef2c and myogenin .

to confirm and extend the results of the microarray analysis, we analyzed a number of the transcripts by quantitative real time rt-pcr. this technique provides a more accurate representation of changes in the level of specific transcripts in the differentiated vs. proliferating c2c <dig> cells than the microarray analysis, since the rt-pcr signal is linear over a broad concentration range  <cit> , as validated by our serial dilution studies with various samples . we analyzed all  <dig> of the up-regulated nets and a sample of  <dig> of the down-regulated nets . for all of the transcripts examined, the results obtained with the rt-pcr reflected the same up- and down-regulation trends as revealed by the microarray data , although the magnitude of some of the changes was different. rt-pcr revealed that the levels of net14a, net <dig> and net <dig> transcripts increased substantially more than seen by microarray analysis , whereas the level of net <dig> decreased less by rt-pcr analysis  than seen by microarray. the massive increase in the level of net <dig> transcript during c2c <dig> differentiation indicates a very strong "off/on" control for this gene during terminal myogenesis.

we also examined  <dig> nets that showed no significant changes in the microarray analysis, nets  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and found that these transcripts similarly showed no significant changes in rt-pcr . as controls, we analyzed transcripts for marker proteins of the ne  and of muscle . as observed with the nets, the rt-pcr results were consistent with the microarray data, and some of the transcripts for up-regulated markers  underwent greater increases than observed with the microarray.

since both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms can regulate gene expression, we decided to examine changes in the protein levels of several nets and control polypeptides during c2c <dig> differentiation . these results were compared to the changes in transcript levels as measured by rt-pcr . for this analysis we prepared affinity-purified anti-peptide antibodies against nets  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which recognized their cognate antigens in isolated mouse liver nes by immunoblotting . however, only  <dig> of these antibodies  was sufficiently strong to detect the antigen in whole lysates of c2c <dig> cells, where the antigens are substantially less enriched than in isolated nes . in addition, the antibodies were not useful for immunofluorescence localization. several well-characterized ne markers  and the muscle intermediate filament desmin were analyzed in parallel. we normalized the protein levels to histone h2b, which is proportional to the amount of nuclear dna and thus to the number of nuclei. h2b levels were closely correlated with the total protein amount in the samples .

in all cases examined, we found that the proteins increased to significantly higher levels than predicted by the transcript levels . whereas the transcript levels of lamins a/c, lamin b <dig> and emerin decreased  <dig> -6-fold during c2c <dig> differentiation, the protein levels increased up to  <dig> -fold. net <dig> protein increased ~ <dig> -fold , and desmin protein increased ~ <dig> -fold . as a benchmark for interpreting these results, we used rt-pcr to compare the transcript levels of desmin and several well-characterized ne markers, including lamins and ne transmembrane proteins, among the  <dig> mouse tissues .

consistent with its known muscle-specific expression, the desmin transcript appeared at a high level in heart and muscle  and at low levels in stomach and intestine, which contain layers of smooth muscle cells on their outer surfaces. the transcript abundance of the ne markers we tested varied widely among the different tissues. however, many of the markers were expressed at significantly higher levels in 1– <dig> of the tissues than in the others  . selectively high expression was seen for lamin c in heart, lamin b <dig> in intestine, lbr in spleen, emerin in heart and skeletal muscle, and man <dig> in skeletal muscle.

our analysis of the mouse tissues revealed that all  <dig> of the nets up-regulated in c2c <dig> differentiation were expressed at relatively high levels in skeletal muscle . five of the  <dig> nets  were expressed at higher levels in skeletal muscle than in any of the other tissues examined, and the 6th  was expressed at its second highest level  in skeletal muscle. the nets can be further grouped according to two general types of expression patterns among the set of tissues:  nets  <dig> and  <dig> showed relatively high expression  in the majority of tissues;  nets 14a,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were expressed with strong preference in skeletal muscle , although nets14a,  <dig>  and  <dig> also were expressed at substantial levels in heart relative to the remaining tissues. the specific cell types where net expression takes place in the "low expressing" tissues remain to be determined. these conceivably could be relatively minor cell populations  in which the expression levels are much higher than the tissue average.

in addition to analyzing adult mouse tissues, we examined the transcript levels for the marker proteins and the  <dig> nets at embryonic day  <dig>  and at postnatal day  <dig> , as compared to adult . although organogenesis is essentially completed at e <dig> in all of the tissues examined except for brain, cell proliferation continues  and the tissues undergo progressive functional adaptation at the  <dig> later times. the  <dig> nets were expressed at the highest levels at p <dig> and/or adult, as compared to e <dig>  in almost all of the tissues examined . a noteworthy exception was net <dig>  which was expressed at a greater than 10-fold higher level in brain at e <dig> when neurogenesis is occurring, as compared to the later times. furthermore, expression of the  <dig> nets in heart and skeletal muscle occurred at substantially higher levels in adult tissues  than in tissues at e <dig> and p <dig>  net <dig> and net14a showed the widest range of expression levels among the different tissues examined, indicating that these genes have the most stringent off/on control . when antibodies of sufficient sensitivity become available, it will be important to directly measure protein levels of nets across various tissues, since the protein levels may not precisely correspond to the net transcript levels measured here .

localization of nets to the ne
we next analyzed whether the  <dig> nets that are transcriptionally up-regulated during c2c <dig> differentiation are bona fide ne proteins, as determined by their ability to target to the ne when ectopically expressed. for our analysis, we constructed cdnas encoding full-length nets with a v <dig> epitope tag fused to their c-terminus, and transiently transfected these cdnas into proliferating c2c <dig> cells. cells either were maintained in normal growth medium , or were shifted to low serum-containing medium for  <dig> days after transfection to induce the formation of myotubes . they then were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence localization of the transfected proteins, either with  or without  pre-extraction of cells with buffer containing triton x- <dig> before fixation. as seen with the previously characterized ne marker lap2β , when ne transmembrane proteins are over-expressed in cultured cells, the proteins become concentrated at the ne but also appear in the peripheral er, presumably resulting from saturation of ne binding sites . we were able to analyze the expression of all of the nets except for net14a, which was not detectable in a significant number of c2c <dig> cells at any time point after transfection.

in proliferating c2c <dig> cells, nets  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> all targeted to the ne and showed elevated nuclear rim staining relative to adjacent cytoplasmic areas . this contrasted with the localization pattern of epitope-tagged calnexin , a marker protein for the er  <cit> , which showed no preferential nuclear rim staining . the ne-associated pool of nets was preferentially retained at the nuclear rim after triton extraction, whereas a substantial portion of the cytoplasmic pool of the nets , and all of the transfected calnexin , was removed. all of the exogenously expressed nets except for net <dig> clearly targeted to the ne in differentiated myotubes ; however, the cytoplasmic pool of the overexpressed proteins in the myotubes was largely insensitive to extraction by triton. net <dig> expressed in myotubes only occasionally showed elevated nuclear rim labeling relative to the peripheral er, in contrast to the other nets. however, ne-localized net <dig> in myotubes may be obscured by the substantial cytoplasmic pool that accumulates during the longer expression times used in the myotube experiments. consistent with our findings with c2c <dig> myoblasts, we previously found that net <dig> targets to the ne of cos <dig> and hela cells in a triton-resistant form  <cit> . in c2c <dig> cells examined without triton pre-extraction, nets  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> typically showed less intense nuclear rim labeling than nets  <dig> and  <dig> , which could reflect lower numbers of binding sites at the ne for the former proteins.

we next used the antibodies we obtained to nets  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which recognize the proteins by immunoblotting, to examine the relative concentration of these proteins in isolated nes and mms of mouse liver . mms from liver are enriched rough and smooth er membrane and devoid of ne components  <cit> . we normalized the signal in the two fractions to the phospholipid content in each sample. we detected specific antigens at the predicted molecular weights for nets  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the ne fraction, and found that the antigens were highly enriched in nes as compared to mms. nets  <dig> and  <dig> were not detectable in mms under these conditions, similar to emerin , even when 3-fold more mms were analyzed by immunoblotting than analyzed in fig.  <dig> . based on the lower limit of detection, we estimate that these proteins are >~90-fold enriched in nes as compared to mms. on the other hand, net <dig> was detectable in mms, and was 16-fold enriched in nes as compared to mms . in contrast to net <dig>  the er resident folding chaperone calnexin had virtually identical concentrations in nes and mms. the ne enrichment of these  <dig> nets extends the analysis with transfected epitope-tagged proteins, and strongly suggests ne-specific functions for these proteins. nonetheless the presence of net <dig> in the mm fraction, albeit at a substantially lower concentration than in the ne, suggests that it may have additional functions in the peripheral er.

discussion
identification and characterization of nets up-regulated in c2c <dig> differentiation
we used dna microarray analysis and quantitative rt-pcr to compare the transcript levels of novel nets identified in our proteomics analysis  <cit>  in samples from proliferating and differentiated murine c2c <dig> myoblasts. we found that  <dig> nets were significantly up-regulated, and  <dig> others significantly down-regulated, in differentiated cultures. based on precedent from studies of tissue development, the up-regulated nets are likely to have a role in muscle formation and/or maintenance, and nets that are down-regulated could antagonize these processes.

in agreement with this hypothesis, we found that the  <dig> up-regulated net transcripts were expressed highly in skeletal muscle of adult mouse, as compared to  <dig> other mouse tissues. of these, nets 14a,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were expressed with strong preference in skeletal muscle , and nets 14a,  <dig> and  <dig> were also expressed at a substantial level in heart. nets  <dig> and 14a showed a broader expression profile, but transcript levels in muscle were still significantly above the average. this confirms and extends our earlier conclusion that nets have tissue-selective expression patterns  <cit> . western blot analysis showed a positive correlation between transcript and protein levels for net <dig> and several markers of c2c <dig> differentiation. while changes in transcript levels are not always reflected in changes of protein levels, this result suggests that other transcriptionally up-regulated nets probably increase at the protein level.

we found that nets  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  when expressed as epitope-tagged proteins in c2c <dig> myoblasts, were concentrated at the ne in a triton-resistant manner, indicating that they are authentic ne transmembrane proteins. however, the fraction of ectopically expressed protein that localized to the ne vs. the peripheral er varied between different nets as well as between individual cells in a transfected population. based on the model that accumulation of membrane proteins at the ne is limited mainly by binding  <cit> , this variability may be due to different numbers of binding sites for each net at the ne, or due to different levels of protein over-expression.

supporting the results of our ne targeting studies in c2c <dig> cells, immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions from mouse liver showed that nets  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were highly enriched in the ne as compared to the mm. nets  <dig> and  <dig> were >~90-fold more concentrated in nes than in mms, similar to the ne marker emerin. in contrast, net <dig> was only ~16-fold more concentrated in nes. since the surface area of the peripheral er is estimated to be ~100-fold greater than that of the ne in hepatocytes  <cit> , p 661), a major fraction of net <dig> apparently resides in the peripheral er in this cell type. our results also indicate that localization of proteins to the ne is not an "all or none" phenomenon. furthermore, the partitioning of different proteins between ne and the peripheral er may show cell type-specific differences. thus, net <dig> may have functions in both the ne and the peripheral er, at least in hepatocytes.

potential functions of up-regulated nets
standard blast searches against publicly available databases  revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> nets up-regulated in c2c <dig> differentiation  contain regions with homology to proteins that have been linked to signal transduction. in addition, the predicted extralumenal region of net14a contains a wd <dig> domain, which typically serves as a protein interaction interface  <cit> .

a model depicting the predicted membrane topologies and homology domains of the  <dig> nets upregulated in c2c <dig> differentiation is presented in fig.  <dig>  the proteins are predicted to have 1– <dig> transmembrane regions and contain one or two sizable extralumenal domains. net <dig>  also termed lull <dig>  <cit> , in addition has a substantial lumenal domain that interacts with torsina  <cit> . whether these proteins reside in the inner or outer nuclear membrane  needs to be resolved by immunoelectron microscopy.

net <dig>  identified independently as lem <dig>  <cit> , shows homology to the first ~ <dig> residues of man <dig>  <cit> , a factor shown to regulate tgf-β signaling . the regions of homology include the n-terminal lem domain  <cit> , two predicted transmembrane sequences and a winged helix domain that binds dna  <cit> . however, net <dig> lacks the c-terminal smad-transcription factor binding domain present in man <dig>  <cit> . nonetheless, we found that the tissue expression profiles of net <dig> and man <dig> are very similar, as both genes have the highest expression in skeletal muscle. thus, these proteins may have partially overlapping functions.

almost all of net <dig> , including the two predicted membrane-spanning regions, spans the complete length of the "spfh" consensus sequence . although the functions of the spfh domain remain unclear, multiple proteins containing this region occur in sphingolipid-enriched "lipid rafts", which are buoyant membrane derivatives identified by extraction with nonionic detergent. raft fractions are thought to represent membrane microdomains that mediate signaling events . analogous to functional models proposed for other spfh domain proteins  <cit> , net <dig> might be involved in the organization of lipid microdomains at the ne involved in signaling. it is plausible that these hypothetical ne microdomains contain sphingolipids, since there are several reports describing sphingolipids and associated enzymes in the ne . one potential substrate for the predicted extralumenal glycosidase domain of net <dig> is o-linked n-acetylglucosamine , which is suggested to have a regulatory role akin to phosphorylation . a second potential substrate of net <dig> are glycosphingolipids, a fraction of which faces the cytosol in the peripheral er . carbohydrate removal from glycosphingolipids generates ceramide, a signaling lipid that plays key roles in differentiation and apoptosis by activating downstream kinases/phosphatases . thus, as either a glycosidase or glycosphingolipid hydrolase, net <dig> could play a role in myoblast differentiation.

net <dig> has homology to phosphatidic acid phosphatase type  <dig> in the region that includes its  <dig> predicted membrane-spanning segments . if net <dig> were a phospholipid phosphatase , it could produce the second messenger diacylglycerol, or might attenuate the levels of signaling lipids that enhance cell proliferation, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate or lysophosphatidic acid . it is intriguing that the actions of sphingosine-1-phosphate and lysophosphatidic acid  usually antagonize the actions of ceramide . thus, the activities of net <dig> and net <dig>  the most highly up-regulated of any of the nets in c2c <dig> differentiation, could be coordinately involved in myogenesis by attenuating cell proliferation signals and enhancing differentiation signals. determining biochemical activities and substrate specificities of nets  <dig> and  <dig> will be key to elucidating these questions.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified  <dig> novel nets with predicted roles in myoblast differentiation and/or muscle maintenance, by analyzing changes in net expression during c2c <dig> differentiation, and by comparing expression levels among various adult tissues. five of these were confirmed to be authentic ne proteins, and  <dig> have homologies to proteins implicated in signaling. we expect that further analysis of these proteins will shed light on the newly emerging functions of the ne in signal transduction and gene expression.
