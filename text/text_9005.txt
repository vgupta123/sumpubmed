BACKGROUND
gene duplications have long been hypothesized to be drivers of genome and gene function evolution  <cit> . recently, availability of large-scale sequence data, and especially entire genome sequences, has brought significant support to this view  <cit> . in plants, duplications appear to be frequent and most lineages studied up to now have been affected by whole-genome duplication events  and/or segmental duplications  <cit> .

starting with ohno, a range of models has been proposed to predict the fates of paralogous gene pairs resulting from duplications. these models can be categorized by their assumptions: they can be either neutral or involving natural selection, and can consider the early stage of duplication, i.e. when the duplication is not yet fixed in the species or start with the assumption that the gene duplication has just been fixed .

immediately after the gene duplication event, the two copies are assumed to be identical and therefore functionally redundant. at this stage, there should be no selective pressure against any loss-of-function mutation affecting either copy. as a result, it is believed that most instances of gene duplications will eventually result in the loss of one of the copies . however, the relaxation of purifying selection  may allow some amount of divergence and occasionally can let one copy acquire a new function and be subsequently maintained by natural selection . this scenario is essential for the creative role of duplication envisioned by ohno  <cit> . force et al. <cit>  suggested that the presence of two redundant genes may drive the fixation of complementary degenerative mutations in both of copies, with higher probability in gene regulatory regions. at the end of this process, both gene copies are required to perform the set of functions originally performed by a single gene . these two scenarios are not mutually exclusive and may act jointly  <cit> . besides these models, the maintenance of functionally redundant copies  could be adaptive under specific circumstances, either through dosage effect or as a means of genetic robustness against deleterious mutations  <cit>  and therefore also explain the fixation of duplications in species  <cit> .

functional analyses have been performed in order to determine the relative importance or the interaction between these different models. the occurrence and the characteristics of functional divergence of paralogous genes can be addressed either through the regulatory or protein-coding sequence angle.

whole-genome expression profiles revealed divergent expression patterns between paralogous gene pairs, providing indirect evidence for subfonctionalization and/or neofunctionalization  <cit> . similar conclusions were also drawn from studies of polyploid species for which duplicated genes were instantly fixed in the species founder individual  <cit> . more specific and detailed functional analyses revealed several cases of paralogs undergoing neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization  <cit> .

beside differences in gene expression, rates of molecular evolution can be used to qualify the constraints experienced by genes. in particular, contrasting the rate of protein-changing  substitution  and the rate of silent  substitution  at the nucleotide level allows qualifying the type of selection acting on individual gene copies after a duplication event. the intensity of purifying selection is often estimated through the ratio ω = dn/ds. values of ω <  <dig> are interpreted as evidence for purifying selection . following pseudogenization, ω =  <dig> is expected . last, amino acid sites exhibiting ω >  <dig> are likely directly targeted by positive selection. as an example, the evolutionary fate of ten genes recently duplicated by retrotransposition in mice was studied by contrasting synonymous and non-synonymous rates  <cit> . gene duplications have been the subject of many functional and molecular studies in plants  <cit> , but here we aimed at analysing specifically the selective constraints exerted on duplicated genes through analysis of their rates of substitution. in order to shed light to the temporal variation of selective constraints acting on duplicated genes following their duplication, we focused on the evolution of fairly recent duplicated genes at a time scale appropriate for coding sequence evolution rates analysis. such study can provide insight about the relative role of relaxation of purifying selection and positive selection in the fate of duplicated genes.

we investigated rates of molecular evolution of three duplicated gene pairs in the genus medicago , therefore maximizing the amount of available phylogenetic signal. we selected gene pairs involved directly or indirectly in the symbiotic interaction between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria . the first genes code for polygalacturonases, which are enzymes involved in the degradation of polysaccharides. one member  is involved in pollen tube elongation and the other  in the tip growth of the infection threads during the establishment of the symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria sinorhizobium sp  <cit> . the second genes are lax . they are auxin efflux carriers and play an important role in auxin-controlled processes such as tissue growth and in particular development of nodules.

mutualistic host-symbiont interactions present the interest of combining several features we can expect will promot fast evolution. mutualisms are often based on nutrient exchanges and involve strong selective pressures, since both costs and benefits are important. the interaction with a biotic partner can cause shifting selective optima, especially if there are conflicts of interest. finally, in contrast with host-pathogen interactions, mutualisms can involve the evolution of novel structures by both partners. the legume-rhizobium symbiosis evolved relatively recently, around  <dig> million years ago, culminating with the emergence of a specific organ, the root nodule  <cit> . therefore, the genes underlying rhizobial symbiosis in legumes are likely to record the signatures of past selective pressures caused by the emergence and diversification of symbiosis as well as pressures linked to their current function. due to a whole-genome duplication event that occurred approximately  <dig> myr ago  <cit> , legumes are therefore a good model to examine the changes of selective pressures over time for duplicated genes.

rates of molecular evolution of paralogous gene copies  should be studied preferably in a variety of species to have enough power to inner substitution rates. moreover paralogs should be characterized in a set of extant species that have diverged after the ancestral gene duplication. in spite the growing availability of full genome sequences, plant model species are usually not related enough to allow for analysis of divergence at the nucleotide level. in the case of the fabaceae family, three species have been sequence , but their divergence times would represent a time scale of 50– <dig> million years  <cit> . moreover, more taxa are needed for contrasting early and late selective pressures. we re-sequenced three pairs of relatively recently duplicated genes in  <dig> other species of the medicago genus . we chose duplicated genes that  are recent enough so that the signatures of evolution post-duplication are still detectable,  predate the speciation events within the medicago genus, so that each copy is found within all species and  contain at least one gene demonstrated or strongly suspected to be involved in the legume-specific symbiotic interaction with nitrogen-fixing rhizobium bacteria.

RESULTS
sequencing pg11a, pg11c, lax <dig> and lax4
depending of the gene, a successful amplification was obtained for a total of  <dig> to  <dig> species. the resulting sequence alignments had a length of  <dig> bp for pg genes and  <dig> bp for lax genes. we excluded sequences that did not encode a complete protein  because they might represent pseudogenes and affect our estimates of rates of molecular evolution in functional paralogs. accession numbers of sequences deposited in genbank are from jn <dig> to jn <dig>  already available sequences genbank accession numbers are aj <dig>  ay <dig> and ay <dig> , hq <dig>  hq <dig> and hq <dig> . details about the sequences obtained as well as genbank accession numbers are given in additional file  <dig> 

phylogeny of pg and lax genes
the phylogeny of lax and pg paralogs were reconstructed using maximum likelihood and are presented in figure 1a and figure 1b respectively. the topologies obtained for the three paralog pairs lax2/lax <dig>  pg3/pg <dig> and pg11a/pg11c confirmed the occurrence of three duplication events predating the divergence between the  <dig> species we included from the medicago genus. moreover, the branches leading to each paralog clade containing the sequences of the same gene amplified from different species are well supported. bootstrap values for the branches leading to the lax <dig>  lax <dig>  pg <dig> and pg <dig> clades are equal to  <dig>  within the pg <dig> clade, bootstrap values obtained for the branches leading to the pg11a and pg11c clades are  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. however, within the pg11a and pg11c clades, several inconsistencies were observed in the phylogenies: sequences obtained with the pg11c copy specific primers for m. carstiensis, m. ruthenica and m sauvagei were placed in the pg11a clade, and conversely, sequences obtained with the pg11a copy specific primers for m. tornata were placed in the pg11c clade . there are several explanations for such inconsistencies: erroneous amplification , the amplification of a third copy resulting from an independent duplication, or genic conversion between paralogs. in order to avoid erroneous interpretations, we did not consider these four sequences further in our analysis.

the species phylogeny deduced from the data was not completely congruent between different paralogs and with the species phylogeny described in the literature  <cit> . however, within clades regrouping sequences of a same gene in the different species, branches are not well supported , indicating a poor phylogenetic resolution. only three groups of species were grouped with high support, irrespective of the gene analysed. the first includes m. tornata, m. truncatula, m. tricycla and m. littoralis, the second m. rigidula and m. rigiduloïdes and the third m. sauvagei and m. laciniata. the medicago genus evolved through a large number of speciation events in a short time span, and as a result, the resolution of phylogenetic relationships between medicago species is difficult. furthermore, incongruences may be observed between gene and species trees due to incomplete lineage sorting  <cit> . for each paralog set, we used the best fitting phylogenetic tree. we repeated the analyses of selective constraints for each gene pair using either the best topology found for the genes considered or a tree topology from the literature  <cit> . results were very similar and conclusions were not affected. consequently, only results obtained using the phylogeny from our data are presented.

analysis of selective pressures along trees: testing for an “age” and a “paralog” effect
comparing models with different constraints on the value of ω among branches of the tree allows testing evolutionary hypotheses . the comparisons of ma versus m <dig> and mpa versus mp test the “age effect” by contrasting early branches  and later branches. similarly, the comparisons of mp versus m <dig> and mpa versus ma test a “paralog effect” by examining the divergence between the two copies. results of these tests are presented in table  <dig> along with maximum-likelihood estimates of ω parameters of each model. when the pg11/pg <dig> paralogs pair was analysed, both the sequences of pg11a and pg11c were considered for pg <dig>  for example, for testing the mp model, both branches leading to pg11a and pg11c were considered for pg <dig>  for testing the ma model, the branch between the node corresponding to the duplication between pg <dig> and pg <dig> and the node corresponding to the duplication between pg11a and pg11c  was considered as the late branch. thus, any effects related to the duplication between pg11a and pg11c is considered only in the pg11a/pg11c paralogs pair analysis.

*note. models: for m <dig>  ω is allowed to take a different value only in the branch of the outgroup ; for mp, ma and mpa ω is allowed to take a different values according to the tested effect, i.e. “paralogs”, “age” or combined as explained in figure  <dig>  np: number of free parameters; logl: log-likelihood; lrt: likelihood ratio test statistic between indicated models; one  asterisk indicates that the probability of observing such an lrt or higher under the compared model is < <dig>  , assuming that the lrt follows a χ <dig> distribution with the difference of free parameters between the compared models as the number of degrees of freedom.

interestingly, the three paralogs pairs exhibited contrasted results. the lax2/lax <dig> paralogs shows evidence for an age effect as shown by both a better fit of model ma relative to m <dig>  and mpa versus mp  tests. we observed a marked increase of ω in early branches . no significant paralog effect was detected and both paralogs lax <dig> and lax <dig> seem to be evolving under purifying selection .

for the second paralog pair, pg11/pg <dig>  both age  and paralog effects  are detected, but effects were weaker and marginally significant. the full model  did not provide a better fit relative to either the age or the copy models. the ma model showed an increase of ω in late branches  and an increase of ω in pg <dig> .

for the third and most recent pair of paralogous genes, pg11a/pg11c, no test was significant, suggesting that neither age nor paralog effects is playing a role or that the extent of nucleotide differences are too small for codon based models to have any power to detect heterogeneity in ω. the analysis shows that overall ω is markedly higher than in the other considered paralog pairs .

analysis of selective pressures along genes: testing for positive selection
in order to investigate how ω varies along genes and in particular if positive selection signatures occurred we used models in which ω is allowed to vary among sites on each gene . as in analysis of selective pressures along trees, when pg <dig> gene is analysed, both sequences of pg11a and pg11c were considered. since positive selection likely targets only a few amino acid positions, branch models used previously typically lack statistical power to detect positive selection as, in the branch model, ω is averaged over all the amino acid sites of the gene.

we compared the fit of models m8a and m <dig>  the likelihood ratio test of m <dig> against m8a is a conservative test for positive selection, since the m8a model can account for an excess of neutral sites. no sites under positive selection were found for lax <dig>  lax <dig> and pg <dig>  however the statistical test of m <dig> against m8a was significant for pg <dig>  pg11a and pg11c  , showing that positive selection targeted both copies of pg <dig>  the fitted ω values suggest that positive selection was stronger for pg11a  than for pg11c  but affected fewer sites . the amino acid site detected under positive selection in pg11a, with a probability of  <dig> , is at position  <dig> and corresponds to a glycine  in the precursor of the protein in m. truncatula . at this position, m. ciliaris, m. polymorpha and m. ruthenica have a lysine , m. rigiduloides a serine  and m. coerulea an asparagine . five amino acid positions under positive selection were detected in pg11c. none of these  <dig> amino acid positions is the same than that detected in pg11a. three amino acid positions had an estimated posterior probability to be under positive selection greater than  <dig> : position  <dig> , position  <dig> corresponding to a glutamine  and position  <dig> corresponding to a threonine  . at position  <dig>  m. littoralis, m. tricycla and m. tornata have an aspartic acid , and m. polymorpha an asparagine . at position  <dig>  the glutamine of m. truncatula changes for a threonine  in m. rigiduloides and m. noeana and for an alanine  in m. polymorpha and m. coerulea. finally, at position  <dig>  all the species have a methionine , except m. truncatula which has a threonine , m. tricycla and m. tornata a leucine  and m. polymorpha a lysine . the two other sites had a posterior probability of  <dig>  and  <dig> , on a tryptophan  in position  <dig> and an alanine  in position  <dig>  respectively. at position  <dig>  m. rigiduloides, m. noeana, m. coerulea and m. ruthenica have a histidine , m. polymorpha a , and m. rigidula an asparagine . finally, at position  <dig>  m. littoralis, m. tricycla, m. rigiduloides and m. rigidula have a serine , and m. noeana a glycine .

note. models are m8a, ω following a β distribution discretized into  <dig> categories of similar frequency  plus an additional category of ωad =  <dig>  accounting for neutral sites; m <dig> differs from m8a only by the additional category of ω which is constraint to be superior to  <dig> , to account for sites under positive selection.

parameters are frequencies and values of ω for m8a and m <dig>  p and q are the parameters in β distribution; for m8a and m <dig> pad and ωad are the frequencies and values of additional class of ω; nb ωad is fixed equal to one in m8a. np: number of free parameters; logl: log-likelihood; lrt: likelihood ratio test statistic between indicated models; one  asterisk indicates that the probability of observing such an lrt or higher under the compared model is < <dig>  , assuming that the lrt follows a χ <dig> distribution with the difference of free parameters between the compared models as the number of degrees of freedom.

selective pressures along branches and sites of each paralog: testing for a “paralog” effect
in the third model we used, the clade model md <cit> , ω varies among sites  and selective pressure at one class of sites is allowed to differ in the two clades of the phylogeny . we tested the significance of md models, with two  categories of sites, compared to null m <dig> models , which assume that two  classes of sites are evolving under different levels of selective pressures, but without difference between clades. as in the previous sections, when the pg11/pg <dig> paralogs pair was analysed, both the sequences of pg11a and pg11c were considered for pg <dig> 

for the three paralogous gene pairs studied, models md for which one class of ω is allowed to differ between paralogous gene clades were significantly better than null models m <dig> in which no variation between clades is allowed . for the lax <dig> and lax <dig> paralogs tests comparing md and m <dig> were significant when either two or three categories of ω were considered. for the other two pairs of paralogs, the test comparing md and m <dig> was significant only when both models were defined with two categories of ω. these results revealed, for each pair, the presence of sites evolving under divergent selective pressures between the paralogous gene clades.

note. models: for m <dig> , ω is free to take the number of values indicated in brackets ; these values are homogenous in all branches of the tree; for md, as explained in figure  <dig> , one category of ω is allowed to differ between the two paralogous genes clades of the tree  <cit> . np: number of free parameters; logl: log-likelihood; lrt: likelihood ratio test statistic between indicated models; one  asterisk indicates that the probability of observing such an lrt or higher under the compared model is < <dig>  , assuming that the lrt follows a χ <dig> distribution with the difference of free parameters between the compared models as the number of degrees of freedom.

for lax2/lax <dig>  none of the ω values was larger than  <dig>  consistently with the result of the m <dig> versus m8a comparison. the model with three categories indicates that more than 77% of amino acid positions are very strongly constrained . the other two categories are allowed to vary between the two clades. for lax <dig> a small proportion of sites is neutrally evolving  and the rest is mildly constrained , whereas in lax <dig> both categories are effectively neutral .

for pg11/pg <dig> and pg11a/pg11c, the category of sites fixed across clades were also found to be under purifying selective pressure . when  <dig> categories of ω were considered, md was significantly better than the null model m <dig> . the category of sites allowed to differ in md model had a proportion of 32% and appeared to be nearly neutrally evolving in pg <dig>  but under positive selection in pg <dig> , as found with the m <dig> model. concerning the pg11a/pg11c paralogous gene pair and as previously detected with site models, the md model revealed that positive selection occurs for the pg11a gene and for the pg11c gene , but in addition md actually detected a difference in the rate of positive selection between the paralogous copies, which appeared to be stronger in pg11c.

discussion
in this paper we examined patterns of molecular evolution of three paralogous gene pairs, in order to detect signatures of post-duplication functional divergence. we chose a time scale that allows analysing patterns of natural selection by examining patterns of nucleotide substitution of protein-coding sequences. with that aim, we focused on three sets of paralogs from the medicago truncatula genome, lax2/lax <dig>  pg3/pg <dig> and pg11a/pg11c. the duplications leading to these sets of paralogs occurred before the radiation of the  <dig> species studied but are still recent, as the three set of paralogs, lax2/lax <dig>  pg3/pg <dig> and pg11a/pg11c, exhibit still  <dig>   <dig> and 88% nucleotide identity, respectively. furthermore, we selected genes that are putatively involved in symbiotic functions, considering that interspecific interactions can involve both evolution of novelty  and co-evolutionary phenomena that are detectable through signatures of positive selection.

models describing the evolutionary fate of duplicated genes once the duplication is fixed in the species suppose different forms of selective pressures  <cit> . first, according to the neofunctionalization model, i.e. evolution of a new function through functional divergence of one of the duplicated copies, selective pressures are expected to be asymmetrical between paralogs  <cit> . the copy fulfilling the ancestral function is expected to remain under purifying selection while the other copy is expected to experience a short period of relaxed constraint and then positive selection driving the acquisition of its new function. second, the subfunctionalization model envisions the fixation of complementary degenerative mutations  <cit> . under this model, relaxation of purifying selection is expected during the period of functional redundancy, and may allow the fixation of at least two complementary degenerative mutations . when both copies are jointly required to fulfil the ancestral gene function, purifying selection is still expected to be prevalent to maintain both copies. although both models have been functionally validated, they are not exclusive and more complex scenarios combining the steps cited previously have been devised  <cit> .

for all three studied paralogous gene pairs, the two copies exhibit different regimes of selection. this result suggests that these paralogous gene pairs have undergone at least some functional differentiation. three different tests were used to qualify selective pressures governing the paralogs. the first one contrasted the average ω between paralog clades of the phylogeny and yielded significant differences only for pg11/pg <dig> . the second test is specifically designed to detect positive selection affecting only a few sites of the sequence. we found signatures of positive selection in both pg11a and pg11c copies, and in pg <dig> . finally, the clade model  is a combination of branch and site models and allows investigating specifically the presence of sites evolving under divergent selective pressures between the paralogous genes and quantify its proportion. the clade model  detected a significant increase of ω in pg <dig> due to the occurrence of positive selection, as detected by the site model m <dig>  for the paralogous pair pg11a/pg11c, branch models failed to detect any difference in selective pressure. model d is more detailed and allows showing that sites under positive selection actually experience a stronger positive pressure in pg11c than in pg11a. lax <dig> is the subject of an intense purifying selection whereas lax <dig> harbours some sites  evolving quasi neutrally . the combination of these different tests provides a more complete picture of the selective pressures at work on each set of paralog. since each single test addresses a single hypothesis, the comparison of several complementary tests allows acquiring a more complete picture. however, the clade model, which accounts for both variation of ω among branches and amino acid position, appears as the most informative for qualifying changes of selective constraint during duplicated genes evolution  <cit> . the only drawback is that it does not test formally for positive selection.

we observed that the pg <dig> and pg11c gene copies were pseudogenes in several species: in m. littoralis and m. tricycla for pg <dig> and in m. tornata, m. rigidula and m. polymorpha for pg11c. since the three genes are present and potentially functional in, at least, four other species among those studied, we can hypothesise that the mutations affecting the function of these gene copies occurred, in some phylum, after the two successive rounds of duplications leading to the presence of three copies. this observation suggests that redundancy between copies is sufficient to have allowed the loss of one copy in several species.

functional redundancy generated by multiple copies also implies periods of relaxed selection pressures, except if duplication itself is advantageous as it is the case, for instance, for a positive dose effect of copy number  <cit> . redundancy is expected to occur with a larger probability when divergence between copies is slowed as it is the case of gene conversion  <cit> . the phylogenetic miss positioning we observed for four genes copies  may be explained by gene conversion. one way to test this hypothesis would be to sequence other individuals of m. tornata for example, in order to see if we could detect shared polymorphism between copies, which is a signature of gene conversion  <cit> .

we detected sites under positive selection in pg <dig> but not in pg <dig>  rodriguez-llorente et al. <cit>  suggested that pg <dig> has been recruited by symbiosis after a duplication affecting an ancestral pollen-specific gene. the authors suggested that the modifications occurred essentially in the promoter region. our results show that positive selection targeted both copies of pg <dig> independently, possibly indicating the evolution of novel gene function. the polygalacturonase family contains members in organisms as distantly related as plants and eubacteria. in plants this gene family has been expanding dramatically through rounds of whole-genome duplications, segmental duplications and tandem duplications   <cit> . the high level of expansion of this family, generating periods of high redundancy, was probably accompanied by pseudogenization events, equivalent to those we detected in the medicago genus. however as expression patterns are diverse between members of the family  <cit>  subfunctionalization events were probably involved in the overall high retention rate of functional genes, notable in this family. functional divergence among members of large gene families may also be driven by positive selection. main examples in plants are disease resistance genes  <cit> , transcription factors  <cit>  or genes involved in development  <cit> . in our study, positive selection is detected in pg <dig>  resulting from the cumulative effects of positive selection in both pg11a and pg11c, the more recent duplicated gene pair we studied. actually, this mode of selection does correspond to neither neofunctionalization nor subfunctionalization in their stricter definition. subfunctionalization does not predict positive selection in either copy, while neofunctionalization predicts positive selection in only one copy . both copies could be under positive selection because they inherited, from the ancestral pg <dig> gene, functions that imply regime of positive selection. alternatively, neo-functionalization could involve adaptive differentiation of both copies , that would mediate adaptive evolution of both copies. selection targets different sites in pg11a and pg11c and the strength of positive selection is different between them . this observation is compatible with both models.

according to the clade models, the paralogs lax <dig> and lax <dig> experience different modes of selection. both genes are mainly under purifying selection. interestingly no pseudogenes were detected in lax <dig> or in lax <dig>  the redundancy stage subsequent to the duplication generating lax <dig> and lax <dig> is not detectable anymore and may have been shorter than in pg gene family. however, lax <dig> appeared to be slightly, but significantly, less constrained than lax <dig>  according to the clade models  a relaxation of constraint is observed for about 20% of the sites for lax <dig> relative to lax <dig>  this means either that lax <dig> acquired a function that implies less functional constraints or that both genes underwent subfunctionalization in such a way that the protein sequence of lax <dig> is less constrained. currently, the precise functions of lax <dig> and lax <dig> are not known. both paralogs are expressed in shoot and roots of nodulating plants of m. truncatula. lax <dig> is found in expressed sequence tag  libraries built from different tissues . lax <dig> is not found in est libraries but expression of lax <dig> was detected in shoots and roots of nodulating plants of m. truncatula <cit> .

the models contrasting ω in different branches allowed testing transient relaxation of purifying selection predicted to occur immediately after duplication. a significant increase of ω was detected in basal branches of the lax2/lax <dig> phylogeny. the opposite trend was detected for the pg11/pg <dig> pair, where purifying selection appeared to be actually weaker in late branches than in early branches, particularly for pg <dig> . however, the value of ω in late branches was likely biased by the occurrence of positive selection in pg <dig>  because branch models average over all sites.

CONCLUSIONS
this study illustrates the multiplicity of mechanisms governing the evolutionary fate of duplicated genes and, in particular, the relative age of the duplication. analysis of nucleotide substitution rates in gene coding sequence can discriminate between qualitative phenomenon  or quantitative differences . further studies of the factors governing evolution of duplicated genes will benefit from taking into account features of the evolution of gene families involving successive rounds of duplications.
