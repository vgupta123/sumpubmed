BACKGROUND
gene expression profile  has been widely used to address the relationship between disease phenotypes and the cellular expression patterns. numerous data mining methods have been proposed for precise classification of disease phenotypes  using high dimension geps  <cit> . although much progress in applying microarray technology to versatile biological kingdoms has been witnessed in recent time, further advancing its efficiency and power in elucidating complex biological mechanisms would very likely rely on our ability to handle the high dimension genetic information mixed with measurement noises  <cit> , intrinsic biological variance  <cit> , and a large number of irrelevant genes  <cit> . however, lack of coherence in biological interpretations often occurring in analysis of gene expression profiling can be remedied partially by integrating with a knowledge-mining tool such as onto-express developed by draghici et al.  <cit> .

cellular biology is essentially to study an interacting network of various functional gene modules that coordinately carry out highly integrated cellular functions in somewhat isolated fashions  <cit> . the assumption that genes express and perform their functions in modular fashions in cells has been supported by accumulated multiple lines of evidence from, among others, gene expression and protein-protein interaction studies  <cit> . inspired by the insight that genes often interplay as a module to realize a highly integrated cellular function, we propose an alternative approach to analyzing the high dimension microarray data by formulating the disease classification problem from a perspective of modularity. in this study, we map genes to their categories in gene ontology   <cit> , which provides a unified gene function classification system across genomes. after annotating each individual gene to a go functional category, we identify gene functional categories enriched with differentially expressed genes. these categories, defined as differentially expressed functional modules, are very likely to be relevant with experimental conditions, or specifically, with the disease type discrimination. for each functional module, we construct a representative functional feature, and then employ a traditional data mining toolbox to train the rule for classifying disease types based on the newly built functional expression profiles . instead of analyzing raw expressions of single genes, we consider the gene expressions within a functional module as an integrative data point to shrink the feature dimension. this modular approach is flexible and also statistically robust to high measurement noise and intrinsic biological variance inherent in microarray data. furthermore, efficient integration with current biological knowledge support provided in the go database has facilitated the interpretation of the underlying molecular mechanisms at the modular level. we apply the alternative approach to analyze four publicly available datasets to demonstrate its performance and statistical properties. the results from analysis of two datasets  are described in the main text. to obtain a robust and convincing comparison of fep and gep, we have undertaken analysis of two additional large-scale datasets and have described the detailed results in the supplement .

RESULTS
description of the two datasets
nci <dig> dataset consists of  <dig>  cdnas whose expression levels were measured in  <dig> cancer cell lines derived from a variety of tissues and organs. a subset of nci <dig>  is used in this study, including  <dig> samples from renal cancer ,  <dig> samples from colon cancer ,  <dig> samples from leukaemia ,  <dig> samples from melanoma , respectively. the same criterion as in  <cit>  is used to identify the differentially expressed genes  >  <dig>  or log <dig>  < - <dig>  in at least four cell lines). a total of  <dig> genes are filtered. the lymphoma dataset contains the expression profiles of  <dig>  cdnas for  <dig> samples of the diffuse large b-cell lymphoma ,  <dig> samples from follicular lymphoma ,  <dig> samples from chronic lymphocyte leukaemia  and  <dig> samples from the healthy sources  prepared from activated human blood b cells and resting/activated blood t cells, respectively. the  <dig>  genes, originally filtered by alizadeh et al.  <cit> , is used in this study. as suggested by alizadeh et al.  <cit> , we exclude  <dig> samples . using the criterion "log <dig>  >  <dig> or log <dig>  < - <dig> in at least eight cell lines"  <cit> , we identify a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes.

fep based analysis of nci <dig> dataset
based on nci <dig> dataset,  <dig> differentially expressed go modules are identified according to a statistical test described in the methods section and their functional expression profiles, a  <dig> ×  <dig> matrix, are denoted with fep114a or fep114m when arithmetic mean or median is used to summarize the overall activity of a module, respectively. the  <dig> differentially expressed go categories are annotated with a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes. for comparison, we also perform classification analysis using the expression profiles of the  <dig> differentially expressed and annotated genes  or the  <dig> differentially expressed genes .

recursive partition analysis of the  <dig> functional features using median as the summary measure identify three significant functional signatures for multiple cancer subtypes. figure 1a depicts the decision tree trained on the fep114m. the internal nodes of the tree are denoted with the functional modules from gene ontology. the leaf nodes give the classification results for different cancer types: the total number of samples contained over the number of the incorrectly predicted samples. figure 1b depicts the functional expression profiles of the three modules . the three modules are annotated with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes , respectively. we identify  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes that are differentially expressed between four cancer types, respectively. hypergeometric tests indicate that all the three modules are significantly  enriched with differentially expressed genes, with the probability of observing a more extreme of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

one advantage for fep based analysis is to allow us to interpret our findings at the modular level. based on the trained tree, we observe that re is distinct from the remaining cancer types and is characterized with the up-regulation of go: <dig> , suggesting that the abnormal up-regulation  of the genes that determine embryogenesis and morphogenesis may contribute to development of re, too. to look for knowledge support, we search g2d database  <cit> . interestingly, significant association of go: <dig> with re has been documented previously. pubmed searching provides further evidence to support the trained hypothesis. gene f2r , which is differentially expressed between the investigated cancers and is also annotated in the module, is pivotal in proliferation and motility of prostate cancer cells  <cit> , colon cancer cells  <cit>  and breast carcinoma cells  <cit> . we thus propose that go: <dig> may be an important functional target for the molecular pathogenesis of re. further distinction between the remaining three cancers can be made by looking at the module go: <dig>  which acts for organogenesis and is down-regulated in me, but is up-regulated in both le and co. g2d database indicates that go: <dig> is indeed significantly associated with both le and co. by searching pubmed, we find that cyp1b <dig> , a differentially expressed gene annotated in this module, was reported to be associated with high risk for developing several forms of cancers  <cit> , which is again consistent with our finding. the third module, go: <dig>  contains a cluster of genes for tight junction and is identified for distinguishing between caners le and co. its association with le has been documented in g2d. in addition, experiment studies agree with our finding that three of the four differentially expressed genes  annotated in the module are members of the claudin family, which were demonstrated to be related to the invasiveness and metastatic phenotype of pancreatic and colorectal cancers  <cit> . in short, the above biological knowledge mining supports our analysis. intuitively, the functional expression patterns, as demonstrated in figure 1b, are clearly distinguishable between the four cancers. re samples have the highest expressions in all three modules and me samples have the lowest. nevertheless, two outliers  have marked deviations from their respective groups and thus not surprisingly they have been misclassified.

to provide an unbiased evaluation on the utility of the trained three modules for multi-class cancer diagnosis, we perform a five-fold cross validation procedure, as described in the methods section, to verify the trained classifier in terms of accuracy, precision and recall. as shown in figure 2a, the classification accuracies for four gene expression measures  are  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. comparing the two summary measures, median  generally perform better than mean , evaluated in terms of the three criteria. using the low dimension function profile and median measure, we have achieved comparable results to those using the high dimension gene expression profiles . however, this application implicates that there is a space for further improvement in multi-class cancer diagnosis using tumour gene expression signatures or functional signatures, perhaps by combining with the other contributed clinical risk factors and histopathological information, to some extent which has reflected the complex nature of cancers.

fep based analysis of the lymphoma dataset
for the lymphoma dataset,  <dig> differentially expressed go modules are identified and their functional expression profiles make up a  <dig> ×  <dig> matrix, called fep44a or fep44m when arithmetic mean or median is used to be the summary measure, respectively. the  <dig> differentially expressed go modules are annotated with a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes. again for comparison, we also perform classification analysis using the raw expression profiles of the  <dig> differentially expressed and annotated genes  or the  <dig> differentially expressed genes .

by a coincidence, we also identify three functional modules for distinguishing lymphoma subtypes. figure 3a displays the decision tree trained on fep44m of the lymphoma dataset. figure 3b gives the expression patterns of the three functional modules  for  <dig> tissue samples. over half of annotated genes in all the modules are differentially expressed between the tissue samples , i.e.,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes measured in the three modules, respectively. hypergeometric tests indicate that all the three modules are significantly  enriched with differentially expressed genes, with the probability of observing a more extreme of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

because g2d database lacks the data for dlbcl and fl, we resort to pubmed for knowledge support. the first identified module, go: <dig>  is a parental category of go: <dig> . three genes  in the small size module are differentially expressed between the lymphoma tissue types. anghileri et al.  <cit>  showed that calcium-overload can lead to proliferation and neoplastic transformation of lymphocytes in mice and suggested the involvement of the calcium homeostasis change in lymphoma induction. at the second layer of the trained tree, go: <dig>  distinguishes dlbcl  from normal samples. one differentially expressed gene annotated in this go module, bcl <dig> , was found to be frequently translocated and hypermutated in diffuse large-cell lymphoma , and it thus may be involved in the pathogenesis of dlbcl  <cit> . the functional module labelled immunoglobulin binding  may be an important modular marker for separating the two lymphoma subtypes . one differentially expressed gene annotated in this go module, cd <dig> , was identified to be associated with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia   <cit> , which is again consistent with our data. median measure fep44m achieves the highest accuracy  for classification of lymphoma tissue types . again, as we expected, median perform better than mean  in terms of accuracy, precision and recall. of special note, fep44m attains a nearly perfect precision or recall rate  to distinguish dlbcl from others , implicating its utility to clinically isolate this particular lymphoma using the identified modular signatures.

we present in additional file  <dig> the detailed numeric results for further comparison of different gene expression measures using four datasets . in all the four datasets, feps have achieved comparable or better classification performance than those geps do. in short, we have provided convincing evidence to support fep as a robust gene expression measure, as a useful summary index for efficient data reduction and as a way towards precise classification of biological phenotypes at the modular levels.

discussion
with the rapid accumulation of gene functional knowledge, go functional modules have been widely applied in inferring the unknown functions of genes based on their expression profiles , but there is an open space for development of the timely and relevant computational algorithms that use robust functional expression profiles towards precise classification of complex human diseases at the modular level. in this paper, we have presented an alternative approach to analyzing microarray data. the central idea is to transform the gene expressions to modular level to achieve both robustness and precise classification with better biological interpretation. we first map genes onto their functional modules according to go hierarchy, and then consider the newly built modules as the features for learning. because the modules are evaluated with a summary measure, its variance is considerably reduced. for this reason, function expression profiling is robust to measurement or biological noises, outliers and distribution assumptions underlying some approaches.

recent time has witnessed the attempts to study human diseases at the modular levels. hanczar et al.  <cit>  grouped the whole set of genes with k-means clustering of the averaged expression values in each cluster and then trained a svm classifier based on these integrated values. huang et al.  <cit>  chose a bayesian formalism of singular value decompositions  coupled with binary regression and stochastic regularization. our approach differs from these methods in at least three aspects. first, we construct a module based on the well established go categories in order to achieve better biological interpretation. second, we identify statistically significant modules enriched with differentially expressed genes to avoid inclusion of some noise modules. third, we can easily procure biological knowledge  because of the very nature of the proposed methodology.

traditional methods for reducing dimension of gene expression profiles are feature selection  <cit> , for examples, wrappers, filters and embedded algorithms. however, if only an optimal gene subset is extracted, many genes of the same  function would be excluded due to redundancy. we have thus proposed an ensemble approach to mining disease-relevant genes by constructing a gene forest  <cit> . alternatively, one may consider analyzing the gene expression profiles at the modular level to avoid unnecessary loss of important information. the proposed modular approach can achieve both goals simultaneously: reducing the dimension of microarray data by transforming the single gene expressions into modular expressions and improving the interpretability on the data mining results. the trained functional modules can be presented graphically and are easily understood by biologists. in fact, a trained tree implicates a decision rule that determine the interactions of modules and can be used to elucidate the complex cellular processes that lead to distinct biological types. our approach could be regarded as a way of identifying disease-relevant functional modules  guided by precise classification of cancers. compared with many tools  developed mainly for gene function annotation using the data acquired from microarrays or other high-throughput techniques, our approach focuses on identification of the modules of high disease discriminating power, thus implicating stronger evidence of their relevancy with the studied disease. however, caution should be taken in interpretation of the module selection for refinement of the biological phenotypes investigated, especially when normal controls are not included. in this case, the modules relevant to disease subtypes should be considered as important molecular signatures which may also be the disease-causing modules.

in the study, genes are annotated to the modular terms in go as granted. nevertheless, the classification system with modules hierarchically structured is neither the most efficient nor the optimal for pursuing specific biological tasks, for example, classifying cancer types using modular signatures. in the context of microarray experiments, a large number of cdna sequences often remain not being annotated by go because of either their unknown functions or ambiguous annotations. to extract maximal information from microarray data, one may consider performing computational function assignments of gene products using the strategy proposed by vinayagam et al.  <cit> . therefore, further investigations on an alternative classification system or an extension of the go system and choices of more efficient indices for functional expression profiling are warranted.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have proposed an alternative approach to analyzing gene expression profiles at the modular levels, where the functional expression profiles replace the traditional gene expression profiles. we have applied the alternative approach to four large-scale microarray datasets, and have achieved comparable or better classification performance by using the functional expression profiles. it should be recognized that median or other modular measures are generally robust to noises because they are less sensitive to any single individual gene expression value. however, for the same reason, they are conservative in using full information of microarray experiments, so it cannot be vouched that fep always has better performance than gep does. despite this fact, the improved biological interpretability and the advantages of robustness to measurement noise and intrinsic biological variance of gene expression data would promote its application in biomedical research.
