BACKGROUND
the baculoviridae family is a major group of viruses infecting insects. its members are enveloped, rod-shaped viruses with covalently closed, circular, double-stranded dna  <cit> . the genome size ranges between  <dig>  kbp  and  <dig>  bp . it has been reported that the baculoviridae family contains  <dig> core genes  <cit> .

based on morphology, baculoviridae family was originally subdivided into two genera: nucleopolyhedroviruses  forming polyhedral occlusion bodies  with single or multiple virions inside, and granuloviruses  with single virions inside ovoid obs made of granulin . in  <dig>  based on genetic sequences and due to host-associated virus evolution new classification was proposed. according to this nomenclature, the family was divided into: alphabaculovirus , betabaculovirus , gammabaculovirus  and deltabaculovirus ) . alphabaculovirus genus consists of group i and ii, depending on the presence or absence of bvs envelope glycoprotein gp <dig>  only the members of group i contain gp <dig>  while gene encoding fusion protein  indicates affiliation to group ii  . it is suggested that group i originated from ancestral group ii of alphabaculovirus  <cit> .

during the life cycle of the virus two different virion phenotypes are observed: occlusion derived virus  and budded virions . the first one is responsible for spreading infection between caterpillars, while the second one for cell-to-cell propagation inside a larvae  <cit> . the members of all baculoviridae family produce odv, while bv is produced only by three genera: alpha-, beta- and deltabaculovirus  <cit> .

the pale tussock moth dasychira pudibunda l.   is a frequent defoliator with economic significance. larvae prefer mainly deciduous trees, especially fagus spp., but they can feed on many different plant species like: quercus, betula, corylus, tilia, juglans, salix, populus, fruit trees and shrubs in orchards as well; very rarely on conifers  <cit> . this pest is present in the entire europe except for far north, but causes outbreaks only in the area of western and central part of the continent   <cit> . since  <dig>  massive infestations have been reported mainly in germany  <cit> , sweden  and denmark  <cit>  – all on fagus trees. in central-eastern europe in countries such as poland, romania and ukraine, the main host plant during outbreaks was quercus robur l.  <cit> . dasychira pudibunda l. occurs also in central asia, china and japan. infected larvae used in these studies were collected in  <dig> in northern part of poland from 50-year fagus sylvatica l. trees growing in the state forest. at present, this pest is relatively rare in poland and does not cause problems in forests  <cit> .

one of the agent that is able to control mass occurrence of the pale tussock larvae is a baculovirus. viral disease which often cause epizootic are responsible for long protection of trees against reestablishment of a pest, therefore the baculovirus is an environmental friendly biopesticide  <cit> . although the existence of dasychira pudibunda nucleopolyhedrovirus  has been occasionally reported in the literature  <cit> , so far there is no genome sequence available in the national center for biotechnology information  database. here, we report the first full genome sequence of this baculovirus, that shows its close relation to orgyia pseudotsugata mnpv , choristoneura murinana mnpv , choristoneura rosaceana mnpv  and choristoneura fumiferana mnpv .

RESULTS
general characteristics of the dapunpv genome
the complete circular dapunpv genome is  <dig>  base pairs long . it is  <dig>  bp longer than the genome of the most closely related baculovirus opmnpv. between dapunpv and opmnpv there is  <dig>  % similarity in nucleotide sequence based on whole genome maft alignment. the at pairs content is  <dig>  % and classifies dapunpv in the vicinity of opmnpv with its  <dig>  %, while the highest at pairs content among the members of baculoviridae family is found in crlegv  -  <dig>  % and the lowest in ldmnpv -  <dig>  %. intergenic regions of dapunpv consist of  <dig>  bp  with at pairs content calculated to be  <dig>  %.fig.  <dig> linear map of the dapunpv genome. arrows represent orientation of predicted orfs; different groups of annotated orfs are colored: pink – baculovirus core genes, blue – all other dapunpv orfs, black – genes of special interest: cbpl, ubil and odv-e27l; light blue rectangles represent repeat regions



the number of putative open reading frames  in dapunpv is equal to  <dig>  nine more than in was annotated in opmnpv genome . two homologues to orfs: dapu <dig> and dapu <dig> were not described in opmnpv due to substitutions associated with changes in stop codons. from all dapunpv orfs found during homologue search using hidden markov models analysis   three had no hits  and another three had e value higher than  <dig>  , which was treated as insignificant. despite the fact that opmnpv genome was annotated in the manner similar to acmnpv, we chose to designate polh  as first orf in clockwise orientation, as it is adopted in recent full baculovirus genomes reports. according to this criterion, there is  <dig> orfs in forward orientation and  <dig> in reverse orientation in dapunpv genome. the ratio of forward to reverse located genes is almost the same in opmnpv  and distinct from cfmnpv  and hycunpv  .

during ngs coverage analysis  only a small narrowing can be observed in intergenic regions. the most significant one appears in a-c rich region because of high di-nucleotide sequence composition. to confirm correct de novo assembly, the standard sanger’s sequencing was performed for this region. we detected one site of single nucleotide polymorphism  that is located at the position  <dig> from beginning of p <dig> gene. this g to a transition change translated amino acid from arginine to glutamine.

recently discovered in alphabaculovirus genus, a conserved, 156 bp long, non-protein-coding genomic element , that is presumed to be responsible for virus replication in transfected insect cell cultures, is present also in the dapunpv genome  <cit> . the cne is located from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp and partially overlaps with dapu <dig> orf. this non-coding region shows the highest sequence identity  and similar sequence composition  with the corresponding one of opmnpv.

phylogenetic relations to other baculoviruses
according to its gene content, including gp <dig> and f-protein, dapunpv is classified as a typical representative of the alphabaculovirus group ib  <cit> . to confirm this classification, phylogenetic maximum likelihood tree presented on fig.  <dig> was generated using the alignments of each of the  <dig> single core genes concatenated into one mafft alignment . all  <dig> baculovirus genomes available in ncbi database until december  <dig> and dapunpv from this report were used . the nearest location of dapunpv to opmnpv on the phylogenetic tree is an additional confirmation of coevolution events between viruses and their hosts  <cit> . both viruses were isolated from infected lymantriidae caterpillars. to affirm this relationship, we conducted evolutionary analyses by calculating relative divergence times for all fully sequenced baculoviruses group ib using nucleotide sites within the scope of collinear genes. the “reltime” method used for creating tree presented in fig.  <dig> indicates that possible divergence of ancestor baculovirus to dapunpv and opmnpv might have happened in the recent past compared to the first divergence in the clade. the method used for this deduction relies on the previous inferred molecular evolution and does not need any calibration events . in a time span analogous for the divergence of dapunpv and opmnpv, two other pairs of closely related baculoviruses  underwent similar evolutionary episode. the concurrence of these events may indicate occurrence of a particular timing when baculoviruses underwent their adaptation to hosts.fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood molecular phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> baculoviruses. amino acid sequences of  <dig> core genes were analysed. the position of dapunpv  was shown clustering with opmnpv in alphabaculovirus group ib

fig.  <dig> time tree molecular phylogenetic analysis of alphabaculovirus group ib. collinear homologue nucleotide regions of baculoviruses were analysed for their possible evolution history. the approximate relative time of divergence between two viruses is visualized by the wide bar on tree node. dapunpv is highlighted by a red rectangle



repetitive genomic regions
homologous repeats  are characteristic for almost all baculoviruses sequenced to date and consist of direct repeats, imperfect palindromes and high at content. within one viral genome they show homology, but it is hard to find similarities between different baculoviruses, except in those closely related. hrs have been considered as origins of dna replication in npvs and gvs and transcriptional enhancers of early genes in npvs . additionally, non-homologous region  origins of replication have been found in some npvs  <cit> .

the genome of dapunpv has three types of repeated nucleotide sequences : five homologous regions , one non-homologous region and one adenine-cytosine rich region . they all have highly similar equivalents in opmnpv genome. the sequence and location of homologous regions are often conserved between related baculoviruses, although their lengths and copy numbers can vary from species to species. every repeated element in dapunpv hrs is composed of 30 bp imperfect palindrome core sequence flanked by regions which are also highly conserved. figure  <dig> shows multiple alignment of strict repeated elements consensus from each hr.table  <dig> repeated regions of the dapunpv

surprisingly, dapunpv hrs share higher level of sequence and localization similarity with hycunpv than with choristoneura spp. which is opposite to the genetic distance based on inferred evolutionary history of collinear genomes fragments . non-homologous repeated region occurs only in dapunpv and opmnpv, but some other alphabaculoviruses group ib can have homologous repeats in the corresponding sites of genomes . another repeated element that is found only in dapunpv and opmnpv is an a-c rich region. in dapunpv it has 222 bp, it is around four times shorter than in opmnpv baculovirus.

one of the characteristic features of the genomic sequence that flanks hr regions is a high level of rearrangements . these genome variations occur even between closely related baculovirus species. for example, conotoxins-like  proteins are found in approximately one third of baculoviruses sequenced to date and some of them possess two genes of different lineages – ctl- <dig> and ctl- <dig>  conotoxins are a big family of small disulphide-bonded peptides, ion channel antagonists firstly isolated from marine cone snail venom. they are classified based on their disulphide pattern and biological features  <cit> . in baculoviruses ctl is transcribed as a late gene and its product is a small secretory peptide not involved in viral infection in vivo or in vitro  <cit> . multilocus presence of ctl- <dig> and ctl- <dig> occurs frequently in all alphabaculovirus group ib. in dapunpv ctl- <dig> is located after hr <dig> in the counter-clock orientation. its homologue gene is inversed in hycunpv, whilst entirely deleted in chocnpv and anpemnpv.

two chitin binding protein families
chitin binding protein  is recognized in all groups of baculoviruses except for deltabaculoviruses. it is considered as a possible pif gene  that plays a significant role during early stages of larvae infection, as its deletion leads to a decrease in pathogenicity  <cit> . sequencing of dapunpv identified two orfs, cbp  and cbpl , as homologues of ac <dig>  protein encoded by cbpl gene  is composed of a signal peptide with a region similar to arthropod chitin binding peritrophin-a domain. proteins with this domain are members of type i peritrophic membrane  proteins, and by binding chitin they form a protective coating of the larvae midgut  <cit> . surprisingly, hmmer search showed that dapunpv and opmnpv cbpl genes show higher level of similarity to alphabaculoviruses from group ii - ldmnpv and lyxymnpv than to other, closely related baculoviruses. unrooted ml tree  confirmed that baculoviruses infecting insects from different species of lymantriidae, possess cbpl genes that are more similar to each other than to cbp genes even of the same species. this indicates that despite their structural similarities, cbp and cbpl do not arise from single gene duplication, but rather by horizontal transfer. in addition, our hypothesis on the origin of these proteins is supported by high bootstrap replicates. probably, cbp and cbpl have the same function during viral life cycle. this would suggest that an evolutionary event  that occurred in the past, was fixed in those baculoviruses that can benefit from an additional factor able to disturb chitin-protein larvae peritrophic membrane rather than from replicon enlargement. phylogenetic relationship of cbp presented on the same tree is consistent with general baculovirus classification .fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood molecular phylogenetic analysis of two chitin binding baculoviruses proteins. two  similar genes show different pattern of clustering. cbpl highlighted by blue tree branch groups more host-specific species than cbp. the positions of dapunpv was labeled with a red triangle



dapunpv and opmnpv genomic diversity
we identified a nucleotide sequence that is  <dig>  % identical to orf dapu <dig> in opmnpv, but is has not been annotated there. this gene with late promoter motif and intrinsically unstructured/disordered protein fragment has its homologue in other alphabaculoviruses ib . based on its predicted structure, this protein, if transcribed, could potentially contribute to cell-cycle regulation, signal transduction or transcription  <cit> .

highly basic p <dig>  protein was described as an unique 228 bp long orf in opmnpv. in dapunpv genome p <dig>  orf is built of 942 bp due to the large insertion in its central region . search against pfam database do not yield any results, though the confirmed translation in opmnpv supports the hypothesis that the homologue of p <dig>  protein plays a role in dapunpv life cycle. the predicted molecular mass for this dapunpv protein is approximately 36 kda. the composition of four basic amino acids specific for opmnpv p <dig>  is about  <dig>  %, while for dapunpv it is equal 25 %  <cit> .

a universal trait of many eukaryotic dsdna viruses is the presence of multigene families  containing related repeated open reading frames  scattered within the genome. the baculoviridae family also contains their own group of such genes called bro genes , that differ in number and length from one virus to another  <cit> . these sequences are present in species from all genera, except in gammabaculovirus, in up to  <dig>  copies per genome  <cit> . however, they are absent in romnpv   <cit>  and plxygv   <cit> . dapunpv genome has three bro orfs . bro a homologues can be found in all alphabaculoviruses ib; bro b as a functional homologue is present in hycunpv, anpemnpv and phcynpv, while bro c can be recognized in hycunpv, cfdefmnpv, agnpv. in chocnpv and cfmnpv the latter two bro genes are shorter and dislocated. opmnpv genome encodes a shorter homologue than dapunpv bro a gene. variations in numbers, locations and content of baculovirus bro genes between closely related species are their well-known characteristic  <cit> .

dapunpv nucleotide sequences corresponding to dapu <dig> and dapu <dig> are only partly present in opmnpv genome in hr <dig> region. because in opmnpv this fragment is much shorter than in dapunpv it does not form any orf. dapunpv consecutive orfs dapu <dig>  dapu <dig> and dapu <dig> have no homologues in any dsdna viruses. an early promoter motif is placed upstream the first gene, whilst the remaining two genes encode transmembrane domain containing protein and a single prokaryotic ring finger family four domain containing protein respectively, which may indicate a bacterial origin of this fragment of the genome. in the same region of opmnpv genome , two conserved orfs are present but are not found in dapunpv.

two orfs, not previously described, with early promoter motifs  are located after dapunpv iap <dig> gene. the nucleotide sequence corresponding to this two genes cannot be found in opmnpv genome. dapunpv iap <dig> is almost half shorter than opmnpv iap <dig> because of a 88 bp deletion and a frame shift. subsequent orf he <dig> of dapunpv shows 73 % nucleotide identity to he <dig> from alphabaculovirus ib anpenpv where in opmnpv only 205 bp of 3’ of full 1650 bp dapunpv gene is present. this opmnpv short region does not code putative gene. he <dig> protein is one of the representatives of rna ligases family and is prevalent in archea, bacteria and eukarya. it is an early transcribed gene involved in rna replication, transcription and modification, as well as in g-actin localization in nucleus during acmnpv-cells infection. it is considered as a nonessential protein for acmnpv and bmnpv  <cit> . homologues of ac <dig> encoding he <dig> gene are found in  <dig> baculovirus genomes . they are present in  <dig> members of alphabaculovirus genus: in all seven from group ia, five from ib , ten from group ii  and five members of betabaculoviruses . in almost half of these cases he <dig> gene is placed close  to late gene encoding structural vp80/p <dig> protein .

another orf that shows indels  type variation between dapunpv and opmnpv is dapu <dig>  where the deletion of 228 bp located in the middle of the gene does not change the reading frame.

the region in the sequence between dapunpv spl  and lef <dig> genes is highly variable in alphabaculoviruses ib. for example in opmnpv and chronpv there is a bro gene, absent in dapunpv. this dissimilarity is 650 bp in length in opmnpv and 1394 bp in dapunpv, where 534 bp encode ubiquitin like protein ; its gene is controlled by an early promoter and does not have a homologue in any baculoviruses . additionally ubil gene locus  and protein size  confirm of its existence. ubiquitin is highly conserved and abundant in all eukaryotes, which indicates its crucial role in cell cycle. the main function in a cell is to direct proteins to degradation pathway but it also takes part in stress response, ribosome biogenesis, and cell differentiation  <cit> . dapunpv genome encodes also another ubiquitin gene  whose homologues have been found in wide range of viruses  <cit> . viral ubiquitin proteins are characteristic for all lepidopteran baculovirus species, that make them core genes for alpha- and betabaculovirus, none of them is present in dipteran- or hymenopteran-specific members of baculoviridae family  <cit> . dapunpv ubiquitin like  seems not to be related to viral ubiquitin  gene conserved in baculoviruses as it has only 30 % nucleotide identity and 17 % amino acid identity.

dapunpv is a first alphabaculovirus group i with two copies of odv-e <dig> gene
odv-e <dig> is a structural protein. although it was named odv-ec <dig>  it is present in both phenotypic forms of baculoviruses like odv and bv  <cit> . it is also presumed to be essential for budded virus production  <cit> . odv-ec <dig> was also reported to act as a viral cyclin that participates in cell cycle regulation during infection  <cit> . homologues of gene odv-ec <dig>  belong to core genes, so it is prevalent in all sequenced to date baculoviruses  <cit>  in one copy, except for single alphabaculovirus group ii - lyxymnpv where two genes have been identified  <cit> . the dapunpv is a second baculovirus with additional copy of odv-e <dig> gene. while dapunpv  <dig> amino acids  protein is similar to smaller copy of lyxymnpv protein odv-e <dig> , it shares only  <dig>  % blsm <dig> pairwise positivity . odv-e <dig> proteins that are encoded by baculovirus core genes are more similar to each other than to dapunpv odv-e27l  or shorter lyxymnpv odv-e <dig> protein. inferred evolutionary history for  <dig> core gene odv-e <dig> and two short versions form dapunpv and lyxymnpv revealed that shorter versions cluster together distantly from core genes . the duplication of odv-e <dig> genes and close phylogenetic relationship of cbpl homologues reveals a surprising connection between evolutionary distinct alphabaculoviruses that infect insects from the lymantriidae family.

protein tyrosine phosphatase
in general, parasites are known to change their hosts behavior during infection. a great diversity of behavioral changes may occur such as in feeding, mating, odor response and activity. in most cases direct molecular causes have not been yet described  <cit> . however, in baculoviruses, egt gene has been noted as responsible for ‘tree top disease’, i.e. it induces climbing behavior in gypsy moth lymantria dispar l. caterpillars during late stages of infection, in order to spread progeny virus on a wider range of healthy larvae  <cit> . another gene ptp encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase has also been shown to participate in behavioral changes of the host bombyx mori l. by strongly enhancing locomotory response to infection in caterpillars, which are normally almost immotile  <cit> . the viral ptp is a component of the virion, consists of hc motif, where cysteine residues are necessary for its function as an active phosphatase  <cit> . protein tyrosine phosphatase gene is present in all lepidopteran npvs in group i. phylogenetic analysis implies that egt as well as ptp genes appear to have a lepidopteran origin  <cit> . during the annotation process of the assembled dapunpv genome, all different tools used predicted three genes that are located one behind the other. we named them dapu <dig>  ptp <dig> and ptp <dig>  comparative genomic analyses between dapunpv and alphabaculoviruses show that ptp genes are highly conserved in genomic sequence, but in many species ptp <dig> is not present . orf dapu <dig> was not predicted in any baculovirus, mainly due to a mutation that changes a reading frame which introduces stop codon earlier to predicted transcript . a genome fragment responsible for this three orfs is in 98 % similar to opmnpv. however, in opmnpv baculovirus, ptp <dig> was annotated as a longer gene that has its start inside dapunpv dapu <dig> gene. this orf enlargement in opmnpv is not supported by genomic sequence from any analyzed alphabaculovirus group i. since comparative genome data is consistent with the data obtained from the bioinformatic tools that we used, we decided to distinguish orfs: dapu <dig> and ptp <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
dapunpv baculovirus is closely related to opmnpv but possesses a few distinctive features. the most prominent ones are genes similar to ubi  and odv-e <dig> . the first gene does not have any homologue in baculoviruses while the second one can be found only in one member of alphabaculovirus group ii – lyxymnpv. this connection between members of evolutionary distinct groups of baculoviruses which infect the same hosts from the lymantriidae is also supported by the shared homologue cbpl gene. dapunpv and opmnpv have  <dig>  % of nucleotide uniformity though there are some differences in gene content . study on phylogenetic relationship between baculoviruses was prepared based on alignment containing amino acid core gene sequences from  <dig> members of baculoviridae family that were manually picked and confirmed.
