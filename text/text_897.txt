BACKGROUND
dendritic cells  are antigen presenting cells that play a pivotal role in the initiation of adaptive immune responses. these cells function as sentinels in the periphery where they are able to recognize and respond to stimuli from the environment they reside in, some of which could be products from invading micro-organisms or helminths. upon such exposures dcs undergo phenotypic changes that allow them to effectively migrate to lymph nodes and prime appropriate t cell responses  <cit> .

the type of compounds encountered by dcs will determine to a large extent the nature of the t cell polarization promoted by these dcs. for this, dcs have to be able to distinguish these different classes of molecules. to this end, dcs express several classes of pattern recognition receptors , such as toll-like receptors , c-type lectin receptors, nod-like receptors and rig-i like receptors that are able to recognize specific pathogen derived components, the so-called pathogen associated molecular patterns . upon engagement of these receptors, signalling cascades are initiated that involve activation of the mapk and nuclear factor-κb , and induction of expression of genes involved in dc maturation and the ability to prime and skew t cell responses  <cit> . it is known that intracellular organisms are primarily capable of instructing dcs to induce th <dig> responses  <cit> , whereas extracts of parasitic helminths have been demonstrated to drive th <dig> skewed responses  <cit> .

relatively much is known about the signalling pathways in dcs induced after triggering of prr  <cit> , however, the molecular characteristics that are different for dcs that have been activated by th <dig> or th <dig> promoting pamp are much less understood  <cit> . we set out to address this issue by characterizing human monocyte derived dcs after exposure to maturation stimulus lps, in combination with bacterial and helminth derived products. the characterization of the dcs comprised gene expression analysis of  <dig> genes that have been linked to activation and t cell polarizing properties of dcs. these molecular profiles of the dcs were correlated to their t cell polarizing capacity. in this study we used gram-positive heat killed listeria monocytogenes  and gram-negative escherichia coli, both of which stimulate tlr <dig> and induce th <dig> polarization. in addition, schistosoma mansoni and ascaris lumbricoides derived phosphatidylserine containing preparations  were used, that also activate tlr <dig>  but drive th <dig> responses in the presence of tlr <dig> ligation by lps  <cit> . we show that the signalling routes and the resulting mrna expression profiles following stimulation by the bacterial and helminth derived products are very distinct. this indicates that not all extracts that contain tlr <dig> activating components modulate dc programming by lps in a similar fashion and in addition suggests that there is a general molecular dc <dig> and dc <dig> signature that can be used to predict th <dig> and th <dig> skewing potential of dcs.

RESULTS
tlr <dig> activating components that induce th <dig> or th <dig> polarization via dcs
to study the molecular characteristics of dcs exposed to compounds that engage tlr <dig> and  <dig>  yet lead to differential skewing of immune responses in terms of th <dig> and th <dig> induction, different pathogen derived products from bacterial or helminth origin with a known th <dig> and th <dig> inducing capacity were chosen and combined with lps, as a reference maturation stimulus  <cit> . for this study gram-negative e. coli and gram-positive heat killed l. monocytogenes  were used as bacterial stimuli that induce th <dig> responses. a schistosome  derived phosphatidylserine containing lipid preparation  and a similar preparation from the nematode worm a. lumbricoides , both containing mainly phosphatidylserine species with two attached acyl chains and some lysophosphatidylserine species  , were chosen as th <dig> inducing compounds  <cit> . stimulation of hek cells transfected with tlr showed that all stimuli could activate tlr <dig>  with additional weak and potent tlr <dig> stimulation by the helminth lipids and e. coli, respectively . ifn-γ and schistosome derived soluble egg antigen , stimuli that do not show tlr <dig> activating capacity in our experiments , and induce th <dig> and th <dig> responses, respectively, were used as controls  <cit> . to assess the t cell polarizing capacity of dcs exposed to these compounds, stimulated human monocyte derived dcs were co-cultured for two weeks with allogeneic naïve cd4+ t cells and il- <dig> as well as ifn-γ production was determined by intracellular staining upon t cell restimulation . dcs were stimulated with the different compounds in the presence of lps, to ensure equal maturation and to rule out potential effects on polarization due to differences in maturation status of the dcs. we found that in all conditions expression of maturation markers was significantly higher than levels measured on immature dcs and more similar to the levels induced by lps alone . as expected, e. coli induced a strong th <dig> response comparable to dcs stimulated with ifn-γ, while hklm induced a moderately polarized th <dig> response. conversely, the helminth derived compounds, as shown before for schps  <cit> , and sea  <cit> , but also the a. lumbricoides derived phospholipids instructed dcs to drive th <dig> skewed responses with the strongest polarization induced by sea . based on intracellular il- <dig> staining there was no sign of th <dig> induction by the differently conditioned dcs, which is in agreement with other studies  <cit> .

mapk activation
to obtain a better understanding of the molecular processes in dcs that could underlie the observed differences in t cell polarizing capacity of these helminth- and bacteria-derived compounds, we set out to investigate in more detail the molecular characteristics of dcs exposed to the different stimuli. to study the intracellular signalling routes activated upon exposure to the helminth and bacterial derived products, we analysed the activation of the mapk. erk  and p <dig> are two effector kinases of the mapk family and are known to play an important role in shaping of immune responses  <cit> . p <dig> has been shown to regulate dc maturation and pro-inflammatory responses, while activation of erk has been related to anti-inflammatory and th <dig> responses  <cit> . as has been described before  <cit> , exposure of dcs to lps alone led to preferential phosphorylation of p <dig> . the th <dig> promoting stimuli ifn-γ and e. coli even further increased the activation of this mapk resulting in a reduced p-erk/p-p <dig> ratio,  <dig> minutes after stimulation , whereas for hklm this ratio did not change. in contrast, the th <dig> inducing compounds ps and sea increased this ratio. interestingly, the high p-erk/p-p <dig> ratio induced by these th <dig> polarizing stimuli was the result of different activation profiles for sea versus the lipid preparations: sea significantly induced phosphorylation of erk, whereas the helminth derived lipids impaired p <dig> activation, but showed no effect on erk activation . the p-erk/p-p <dig> ratio showed a positive correlation with th <dig>  and negative correlation with th <dig> polarization . in conclusion, for all components tested, the p-erk/p-p <dig> ratio only  <dig> minutes after dc stimulation can be used to predict the outcome of the t cell response with regard to th <dig> and th <dig> polarization. this shows that very early events in dc activation already determine the fate of the dcs in terms of their t cell polarizing capacity.

gene expression analysis
to further characterize the molecular profile of the differentially stimulated dcs we performed mrna expression analysis, using real-time pcr, on a selected set of genes involved in tlr signalling and t cell polarization . upon maturation with lps, the expression of most genes was increased . all data shown are relative to what is seen in mature dcs without any polarizing agents added, i.e. dcs stimulated with lps. stimulation of dcs from different individuals with the same stimulus showed very consistent profiles . clustering analysis revealed that the gene expression profiles of th <dig> and th <dig> polarizing agents clustered in separate groups . within the th <dig> stimuli, dcs exposed to bacterial products derived of l. monocytogenes and e. coli had a remarkably similar profile that was different from the profile induced by ifn-γ. for the th <dig> stimuli, both helminth derived lipid preparations showed a very comparable profile, which resembled the expression profile induced by sea for most of the genes . however, expression levels in ps pulsed dcs were generally lower than in sea stimulated dcs which is in accordance with the less pronounced effects on activation of the mapk by the ps preparations.

next, we related expression levels of individual genes to the t cell polarizing capacities of the dcs, to identify potential mechanisms through which different pathogen derived compounds induce differential t cell polarization. members of the il- <dig> cytokine family are well known for driving th <dig> polarization  <cit> . indeed the expression of both il- <dig> p <dig> and p <dig>  but also il- <dig> p <dig> were shown to be upregulated in dcs stimulated with th <dig> inducing stimuli and reduced in dcs stimulated with helminth derived compounds . this was confirmed at the protein level when il- <dig> and il- <dig> production by dcs were measured by elisa .

with respect to t cell polarization, other genes of interest are the notch ligand family members delta- <dig>  delta- <dig> and jagged- <dig>  since expression of delta and jagged on dcs has been associated with induction of th <dig> and th <dig> responses, respectively  <cit> . for jagged- <dig> and delta- <dig> no significant differences were found between the stimuli . however, delta- <dig> was upregulated by the bacterial th <dig> inducing stimuli, and downregulated by the th <dig> inducing lipids. moreover, expression levels of delta- <dig> correlated with the il-4/ifn-γ cytokine ratio produced by the t cells of the stimuli that activate tlr <dig> . yet, in sea and ifn-γ stimulated dcs delta- <dig> expression was not altered. therefore, delta- <dig> seems to associate with t helper cell polarization only when tlr <dig> is also engaged.

conversely, we found higher c-fos mrna levels in ps and sea pulsed dcs compared to hklm and e. coli stimulated dcs. c-fos has been shown before to mediate sea induced repression of il- <dig> secretion by dcs  <cit> . indeed, correlation analysis revealed that in dcs stimulated with bacterial products or helminth-derived lipids, mrna levels of c-fos were positively correlated with th <dig> induction .

discussion
dcs express a range of prr that allow them to recognize different pathogens and initiate appropriate adaptive immune responses. pivotal to this process is the proper integration of prr derived signals into a molecular activation profile of dcs that leads to a particular t cell polarizing capacity. this study demonstrates that combined tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> activation in the context of different bacterial and helminth derived extracts can lead to very distinct molecular activation profiles of human dcs which correlate with their t cell polarizing capacity in terms of th <dig> and th <dig> skewing.

one of the major signalling cascades triggered upon engagement of tlr is the mapk pathway. differential activation of mapk p <dig> and erk in dcs has been associated with different level of maturation and cytokine production whereby p <dig> is thought to be important in mediating dc maturation and pro-inflammatory t cell responses, whereas erk activation has more often been associated with anti-inflammatory and th <dig> responses  <cit> . earlier studies in human dcs have primarily focused on the role of different mapk in dc activation, such as maturation and cytokine production  <cit> . we extended these studies, by analyzing for the first time the correlation between p-erk/p-p <dig> ratios in human dcs and the degree of skewing of t cell responses by using various th <dig> and th <dig> inducing pathogen derived extracts. at  <dig> minutes after stimulation, we observed decreased p-erk/p-p <dig> ratios in the th <dig> promoting dcs. of the two th <dig> polarizing agents, e. coli induced more p <dig> activation, compared to hklm, which is in agreement with the stronger th <dig> polarization of the t cells . in contrast, all helminth-derived stimuli increased the p-erk/p-p <dig> ratio in the dcs. comparison of the mapk activation profile induced by the helminth-derived lipids with the one induced by sea, revealed that sea, like other helminth derived antigens such as lnfpiii  <cit>  and es- <dig>  <cit> , induces a higher p-erk/p-p <dig> ratio by increasing activation of erk. on the other hand, the lipids influenced the p-erk/p-p <dig> ratio by specifically impairing p <dig> phosphorylation. thus, although the lipids share the capacity with other helminth antigens described so far to condition dcs for th <dig> priming, they appear to achieve this differently exemplified by a different modulation of the map kinase signalling pathway. taken together, the p-erk/p-p <dig> ratio appears to be an important characteristic of antigen presenting cells exposed to pathogen derived compounds that skew responses towards th <dig> or th <dig> 

comparison of the mrna expression profiles of tlr activating bacterial and helminth derived compounds revealed that, unlike the th <dig> inducing phospholipids, exposure of dcs to th <dig> promoting stimuli preferentially led to the induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig>  both at the mrna and the protein level. the degree of p <dig> activation, known to drive pro-inflammatory gene expression by these stimuli, was reflected by the level of expression of these cytokines. the higher expression levels of il- <dig> and il- <dig> in the e. coli and ifn-γ stimulated dcs compared to hklm pulsed dcs, probably contributes to the stronger th <dig> induction seen with the former two stimuli.

while the immunological processes resulting in th <dig> polarization have been extensively characterized, it is still poorly understood how exactly th <dig> responses are initiated. one of the genes that was found to be positively associated with th <dig> inducing dcs was the transcription factor c-fos. c-fos has been shown to mediate il- <dig> suppression in sea pulsed dcs, which is generally thought to be a prerequisite for th <dig> induction  <cit> . in addition, the observation that c-fos mrna expression levels were strongly correlated with th <dig> induction not only for sea, but also for ps, further supports the notion that this transcription factor plays a role in the promotion of helminth antigen dependent th <dig> skewing. however, analysis of c-fos at the protein level revealed that in ps pulsed dcs the increase of c-fos was lower and more transient, compared to sea stimulated dcs . therefore, it remains to be established whether c-fos plays a similar role in ps pulsed dcs as has been shown for dcs modulated by sea.

notch ligands have been reported to play a role in th1/th <dig> polarization by dcs  <cit> . while jagged- <dig> expression was initially implicated in dc mediated th <dig> differentiation  <cit>  more recent studies  <cit>  show that jagged- <dig> has no role in th <dig> induction by sea activated dcs. our findings are in accordance with these latter studies, since we did not observe any increased jagged- <dig> mrna expression in our helminth derived stimulated dcs. interestingly, another notch ligand delta- <dig> was found to be upregulated in dcs cocultured with bacterial compounds, while helminth derived compounds showed a decreased delta- <dig> expression. this in agreement with studies that show that delta- <dig> is involved in th <dig> skewing  <cit> , as well as inhibition of th <dig> development  <cit> .

several studies have shown that tlr <dig> activation alone may lead to different outcomes; th <dig>  <cit> , treg  <cit>  as well as th <dig>  <cit> . the variety of outcomes possible in the presence of tlr <dig> activation have been suggested to be the result of heterodimerization of tlr <dig> with different receptors, such as tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  <cit> , or associations with other receptors including nod-like receptors and c-type lectins  <cit> . in our study, the compounds used from helminths or bacteria are mixtures of antigens that would be expected to signal via additional receptors besides tlr <dig>  e. coli has been shown to activate tlr <dig> and nod <dig>  <cit> , whereas resistance to listeria infection was related to the presence of functional nod <dig>  <cit> , indicating that this receptor is engaged by hklm. relatively little is known about th <dig> skewing by the helminth derived compounds, but in a previous study of schistosomal lipids it was shown that tlr <dig> activation was not needed for th <dig>  but rather for regulatory responses  <cit> . therefore, it is important to study the engagement of additional prr along with tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> to fully understand the mechanisms that play a role in conditioning dcs for priming of th <dig> responses  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the study presented here indicates that tlr <dig> ligation on monocyte derived dcs in the context of tlr <dig> stimulating bacterial or helminth derived extracts leads to profoundly different outcomes in terms of activation or expression of various markers at the level of mapk phosphorylation, mrna expression and protein up- or downregulation. we show for the first time in human dcs that the levels of a selected number of molecular markers are strongly correlated with the t cell polarizing capacity of dcs. this not only gives us new insights about the processes involved in th <dig> and th <dig> polarization but it also suggests that there is a common molecular th <dig> and th <dig> signature in human dcs that can be used to predict the strength of induced th skewing in terms of the th1/th <dig> balance.
