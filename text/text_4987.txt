BACKGROUND
type  <dig> diabetes  is a complex disease, encompassing various metabolic abnormalities influenced by both gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. methodologies involving linkage analysis and/or association studies have been extensively exploited to identify the underlying genetic factors. recent, advances using genome wide association  studies undertaken in large sample sets have provided a few susceptibility genes  <cit> . the success of gwa studies relies on the discovery of common variants of common diseases, however rare variants may also influence the risk of type  <dig> diabetes that are not captured in gwa studies. hence, all these approaches have yielded very limited success, warranting new approaches, complementing the existing ones for disease gene discovery. linkage analyses localize disease linked markers onto chromosomal regions that may correspond up to  <dig> mb harboring several hundred genes  <cit> . ideally, the information obtained through large number of genome-wide linkage studies has to be utilized to search t2d genes using a positional candidate based association studies. but, it is cost expensive and labor intensive apart from being time consuming to screen for each gene in the t2d linked region. therefore, it is necessary to prioritize positional genes located in the linked chromosomal regions that would facilitate and expedite the identification of disease genes. previously, a study used meta-analysis approach to prioritize disease genes from t2d and obesity linked regions based on consensus gene prioritization methods  <cit> . however, consensus methods are not always appropriate as they are primarily based on keyword similarity or phenotypes like biomedical text searches and associated pathological conditions for prediction  <cit> . recently, protein-protein interaction data have also been extensively exploited for candidate gene prioritization in monogenetic as well as complex diseases  <cit> .

previously, we demonstrated that t2d may result from disturbed protein-protein interactions resulting through disrupted modular domain interactions  <cit> . from this lead, here we have developed systems biology approach based on domain-domain interactions to prioritize positional candidates located in t2d linked regions . the method assumes that the functional relationship of protein-protein interactions is primarily facilitated by domains of the interacting proteins  <cit> . information regarding the functional, positional and network properties of disease related genes are utilized by this method. network measures like node connectivity and clustering coefficient values of molecular interaction networks have been extensively used to study the topological properties of disease genes  <cit> . recently, it has been shown that disease genes avoid 'dense clustering neighborhoods' and have an average clustering coefficient of  <dig>   <cit> . based on these properties, the positional candidates were first ranked by formulating a scoring method that assigned weight value  to each candidate. further, we exploited network measure to prioritize hwes  referred to as hrc method .

comparison with other known prioritization methods which are based on sequence analysis as well as protein-protein interactions showed that our method had a gene enrichment ratio of  <dig>  which is better than the other methods compared. we also predicted the functional processes brought about by positional candidates with special emphasis on those with unknown functions. this was done by constructing network motifs from the domain interaction network. these motifs represent specific biological functions and hence provide an insight regarding the physiological role of particular candidate. we believe such an approach which amalgamates functional, genetic and network properties could prove to be immensely helpful in ranking the positional candidates involved in disease.

RESULTS
here, we integrated wv method and domain interaction network property  to predict positional candidates with a high likelihood to be involved in disease etiology. the calculated wv for proteins ranged from 0- <dig> with the magnitude indicating relevance to t2d. the candidates with wv >  <dig>  were prioritized as high weight elements . from the dataset of  <dig> proteins, encoded by genes located within  <dig> mb region encompassing  <dig> markers linked with t2d ,  <dig> candidates were classified as hwes.

we assumed that most likely disease genes among hwes should also share the network property. a recent study of network properties of disease genes has demonstrated that the disease genes avoid dense clustering neighborhood compared to essential genes and have an average clustering coefficient of  <dig>   <cit> . hence we used average ci of  <dig>  as a cut-off to prioritize hwes. ranking of hwes based on their clustering coefficient  in the domain interaction network  resulted in  <dig> most likely disease candidates termed as hwec . the topological features of the interactions derived here from domain interactions include an average degree of connectivity  of  <dig> , an average clustering coefficient  of  <dig>  and the shortest path length of  <dig> . among the hwes, 44% had ci <  <dig>   whereas among the test dataset  only 35% of the proteins had ci <  <dig>  . our analysis revealed that majority of hwec had less connectivity  compared to test dataset which had preponderance of genes with higher connectivity  . this indicates that hwec proteins have fewer links with low ci and might be less interconnected; these represent the network properties shared by disease genes. furthermore, this also supports the assumption that genes that lie in the network-neighborhood of disease genes are more likely to be involved in disease causation. using bingo  <cit>  we assigned the biological processes from gene ontology  shared by ranked candidates and found predominant involvement of hwec in metabolic and signaling processes .

functional relevance of network motif analysis
network motifs that are the indicators of specific functional modules in cellular networks  <cit>  were used to predict functions for hypothetical hwec genes. for instance, network motif analysis showed that q6mzn <dig> protein  with domain pf <dig> forms a four node motif with partners pf <dig> , pf <dig> , pf <dig>  suggesting its role in energy metabolism. the predicted functions were also cross-validated using the protfun server by matching with the functional classes assigned by protfun. protfun server also predicted the involvement of q6mzn <dig> protein in energy metabolism. energy generation in mitochondria occurs primarily through oxidative phophorylation and as genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are known to be coordinately downregulated in t2d, q6mzn <dig> might attain significance  <cit> .

performance of the methods
the benchmarking dataset used to evaluate the performance of our methods, comprised of  <dig> genes known to be associated with t2d from gwa studies  <cit>  and  <dig> non-t2d genes lying within  <dig> mb regions of  <dig> chromosomal positions those are never shown to be linked with any disease, as control data set. we observed sensitivity of wv method to be  <dig>  and specificity to be  <dig> . for hrc method, sensitivity and specificity were  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. overall data enrichment of  <dig> fold and  <dig>  fold was observed for the two methods respectively. using the benchmarking dataset, we compared both wv and hrc predictions with other known methods of candidate gene prioritization . the receiver operating characteristic  analysis of the two methods, wv and hrc confirms their better performance , with only prospectr  <cit>  having a higher sensitivity  than wv and hrc. where, g2d method gave accuracy and sensitivity of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively with the benchmarking dataset.

further, other gene prioritization methods including prospectr  <cit> , suspects  <cit> , disease gene prediction   <cit>  and g2d  <cit>  were used to prioritize our dataset of  <dig> genes. prospectr and suspects gave a disease gene estimate of  <dig> in  <dig>  , dgp did  <dig> in  <dig>   and for g2d it was  <dig> in  <dig> . whereas, wv method gave disease gene estimate of  <dig> in  <dig> , wv + hrc provided an estimate of  <dig> in  <dig>  . thus, it was striking that prospectr, suspects and dgp predicted a higher number of genes to be disease candidates compared to our method. among the other methods, g2d performed the best. while comparing the common candidates predicted by wv + hrc and other methods we found that 84%  were prioritized to be disease candidate by any one of the methods while 16%  of the candidates were the unique candidates prioritized by our method .

when compared with genewanderer  program  <cit>  it was found that our method identified  <dig> disease genes compared to  <dig> by genewanderer . since, wv approach includes prioritization based on the positional relevance of the candidate with relation to t2d linked regions and that some of the gwa genes do not lie in this region there is a likelihood of missing out on some candidates.

discussion
identification and prioritization of the disease genes for complex diseases like t2d is inherently difficult. the etiology of t2d, though not very clear, involves multiple pathways wherein each probable disease gene confers only a modest risk. thus, to understand the disease pathophysiology it is better to explore the global interaction network than single gene identities. these interactions if employed to prioritize genes might considerably increase the chance of detecting disease genes as perceived in our approach. the method relies on the disease-specific characteristics as reflected from the observation that  <dig> disease genes  from total  <dig>  were identified. the performance of wv and hrc methods showed accuracy and specificity better than other sequence based candidate gene prediction methods. the robustness of our method is well demonstrated by the benchmarking parameters. furthermore, the go sharing showed a higher representation of metabolic and signaling processes in the ranked genes. this confirms the common belief that genes associated with same disorder share similar functional characteristics  <cit> . most of the ranked candidates were also found to be involved in diverse biological processes important in t2d like insulin secretion , hdl metabolism , modulation of insulin action , oxidative phosphorylation  and triacylglycerol synthesis . further, an immediate support of our work can be obtained from the recent association of lpin <dig> gene to t2d  <cit> . prioritization of candidates like lpin <dig> as high ranked candidates, clearly indicate the efficiency and importance of our method.

as t2d is a polygenic disease involving multiple biological processes, it is imperative that disease genes will be rare in topologically central regions of network. it has been observed that the important functional modules are located in the dense regions of protein interaction network having high degree of connection and high clustering coefficient  <cit> . also these dense regions of interaction networks probably perform the basic evolutionary processes with specialized functions being done by peripheral nodes  <cit> . therefore, here we have used clustering coefficient , in a domain interaction network to prioritize t2d disease candidates. this conglomerate modus operandi is evenhanded for genes encoding proteins having both known and unknown functions which are often ignored during disease gene identification.

the other known systems biology approaches for candidate gene prediction are based on direct protein-protein interaction of the gene that is being studied  <cit> . but, the limitation of these methods is that presently only 10% of all human protein-protein interactions have been described  <cit> . here, we have tried to address this by exploiting the interactions of partner domains and their harboring proteins for prioritization. this increases the coverage of the search for the disease candidates in global interaction network. notwithstanding this, a note of caution is warranted as the ranking of candidates here, could be affected by the appropriateness of the interdom  <cit>  and the score it provides, as the interaction networks are neither complete nor error free. moreover, we have tried to encompass the true positive interactions by having the obstinate cut-off score, with validations from other data sources as well. still, owing to the constraints in the gene annotation in the regions selected, availability of interaction data and that of ascertainment bias there is a possibility that a few plausible disease candidates would have missed out during the screening process.

CONCLUSIONS
to achieve cost-effective experimentation and expediting the process of disease gene discovery it is essential to develop disease-specific methodologies rather than to rely solely on model-free approaches. our method ranks the candidate genes in linked regions using t2d specific properties. we believe that performance of this method would improve with the availability of better gene and protein annotation and of true positive interaction data.
