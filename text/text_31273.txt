BACKGROUND
aminopeptidase b  activity was originally defined as an exopeptidase able to remove basic amino acid residues from the nh2-terminus of peptide substrates  <cit> . such activity led to the hypothesis that the enzyme participates in the final steps of precursor processing, namely of neuropeptide and hormone precursors  <cit> . in most cases, proteolytic activation of peptide precursors occurs at arginine and lysine residues and involves the sequential action of an endoprotease and an exopeptidase  <cit> . research efforts had focused primarily on endopeptidases cleaving at the cooh-terminus of basic amino acid doublets and on the subsequent participation of a carboxypeptidase e or h .

however, several endoproteases have been shown to produce cleavage of basic amino acid doublets on their nh2-terminal side  <cit> . moreover, nh2-terminally extended form of various peptides, bearing an extra arg or lys residue resulting from proteolytic processing of their corresponding precursors, have been described  <cit> . several recent studies have demonstrated that ap-b activity occurs in combination with different proteases, such as nrd convertase  <cit> , cathepsin l  <cit>  and aminopeptidase a  <cit> . although clarification of the physiological relevance of ap-b and identification of all of its in vivo substrates is not complete, some of these substrates were recently identified. indeed, ap-b processes glucagon into miniglucagon in the α-cells of the islets of langerhans  <cit>  and could also process angiotensin peptides in rat cardiac fibroblastic cells  <cit>  and enkephalins in various tissues  <cit> . the enzymatic properties of ap-b and its expression pattern  <cit>  lead to the hypothesis that this enzyme could be involved in inflammatory processes  <cit> , development of tumours  <cit>  and type ii diabetes  <cit> .

the biochemical characterization of the purified enzyme isolated from rat testis yielded important information. ap-b is a monomeric  <dig> kda zn2+-dependent exopeptidase, which selectively removes arg or lys residues from the nh2-terminus of several peptide substrates  <cit> . in addition to its exopeptidase activity, ap-b exhibits a residual capacity to hydrolyze leukotriene a <dig>  into the pro-inflammatory lipid mediator leukotriene b <dig> , in vitro  <cit> . the bi-functional nature of ap-b is supported by a close phylogenetic relationship with lta <dig> hydrolase , which hydrolyzes lta <dig> into ltb <dig>  in vivo, and exhibits an aminopeptidase activity, in vitro  <cit> . both enzymes belong to the m <dig> family of metallopeptidases .

the high-resolution crystal structure of lta4h in complex with inhibitors  was recently described  <cit> . this was the first 3d structure determined in the m <dig> family of metalloexopeptidases to which ap-b also belongs. various attempts to crystallize ap-b have failed due to the low solubility of the enzyme. however, the phylogenetic relationship between lta4h and ap-b offered the opportunity to model the ap-b structure using lta4h as a template in order to acquire structural data which will be essential to understand the enzymatic mechanisms, the structure of potential physiological substrates and to design potent inhibitors of ap-b.

in this paper, we describe the production and purification of the rat ap-b  in e. coli, the characterization of the recombinant protein and its catalytic properties. eighteen different mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis to confirm the functional roles of conserved amino acids belonging to the m <dig> consensus motif , which constitutes the zn2+-binding site. as a step toward the determination of the ap-b catalytic mechanisms and the structural requirements for the control of substrates specificity, a complete alignment of  <dig> sequences of the m <dig> family was performed to point out conserved residues and evolutionary divergences. a part of this alignment was used for the construction of a 3d model of the whole  <dig> amino acid-long rap-b based on the crystal structure of human lta4h  <cit>  in complex with zinc ion and bestatin.

the structural relevance of some previously in silico detected consensus sites, such as rnp <dig> binding motif and armadillo domain involved in protein-protein interactions is also discussed. lastly, structural surface differences between ap-b and lta4h were examined and the results lead to the hypothesis that ap-b exhibits numerous protein-protein interaction properties according to its putative physiological functions.

RESULTS
expression and purification of the e. coli recombinant rat ap-b protein
a  <dig> bp-long dna fragment containing the rat ap-b cds was cloned into the pivex <dig>  expression vector . then, the recombinant rat ap-b protein  was produced with this t <dig> promoter-driven plasmid in a bli <dig> e. coli strain. the translated product comprises a histidine tag  at the nh2-terminus followed by a factor xa restriction protease cleavage site and the rap-b sequence, providing a  <dig> amino acid protein . the difference in length due to the fused his-tag/factor xa site tail  leads to a slight difference of electrophoretic mobility, which is observed in western blot analysis . this latter also shows that his-rap-b is properly expressed in this prokaryotic expression system.

cloning of rap-b as a nh2-polyhistidine-tailed protein allows a rapid purification procedure. figure 1-c shows that there is a significant loss of desired his-rap-b during the first washing. any attempts to increase the binding specificity of the histidine tag during this step led to a decrease of specificity during the elution steps. gel electrophoresis of the elution fractions e <dig> and e <dig>  showed only one band with a relative molecular mass around  <dig> kda . both fractions were pooled and concentrated to  <dig> ml in tris-hcl  <dig> mm ph  <dig> . the final concentration of the purified his-tag rap-b was about  <dig> μg.ml- <dig>  consequently, an adequate quantity of enzyme is obtained with this purification procedure since we obtained  <dig> μg of purified protein from  <dig> ml of cell culture corresponding to a purification rate of  <dig>  mg.l- <dig> 

in order to identify potential differences in the kinetic parameters of the enzyme activity due to the purification procedures, the his-tagged rap-b was also semi-purified using a deae trisacryl plus m ion exchange column eluted with  <dig> mm kcl . gel electrophoresis of the elution fractions containing ap-b activity  showed several bands with a relative molecular mass between  <dig> to  <dig> kda . fractions  <dig> to  <dig>  which contain  <dig> main detectable bands on the silver stained sds-page were pooled  and concentrated to  <dig> ml in tris-hcl  <dig> mm ph  <dig> . the final concentration of the semi-purified proteins was ~ <dig> μg.ml- <dig> versus  <dig> μg.ml- <dig> for fractions  <dig> to  <dig>  within the limits of a visual quantification, this analysis shows that the amounts of his-tagged rap-b corresponds to about 30% of the total proteins leading to an estimated purification rate of about  <dig> mg.l- <dig>  note that subsequent exclusion chromatography steps do not allow the separation of the contaminant proteins despite their molecular mass differences .

a western blot analysis completes the identification of the proteins resulting from these purification procedures  and shows that no degradation products were generated.

characterization of the purified his-tagged rat ap-b activity
kinetic constants for the enzymatic reaction of his-rap-b with l-arg and l-lys β-na were estimated from lineweaver-burk plots of 1/v against 1/ and hanes-woolf plots of /v against  in the substrate concentration range 1– <dig> μm .

km, vm and kcat values are the means ± standard error of three independent series of tests in which each point was performed in triplicate. comparative values, obtained with his-r-ap-b purified from baculovirus infected insect cells  <cit>  and rat testes ap-b  <cit> , are indicated.

the enzymatic activity of his-rap-b is probably higher than estimated above. indeed, a decrease of activity due to the higher purification of the enzyme was previously described  <cit> . meanwhile, this purification step is required to calculate the kinetic constant such as kcat and consequently kcat/km. equivalent measurements using the deae semi-purified his-rap-b show that enzyme activity is similar to that of ni-nta . consequently, the semi-purified enzyme can also be used in activity assays. the comparison of kinetic values between baculovirus recombinant ap-b  <cit> , rat testes enzyme  <cit>  and e. coli recombinant protein shows that this latter constitutes a reliable tool to study the enzymatic mechanism of ap-b, avoiding long procedures of purification .

addition of  <dig>  m nacl with either the purified rat testis ap-b protein or the recombinant enzyme expressed in baculovirus system, results in a 3-time increase in activity  <cit> . consequently, the effect of nacl was studied by assaying bacterial recombinant his-rap-b activity in the presence of different concentrations of nacl ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> m in  <dig>  m borate buffer ph  <dig>  . a similar increase of activity  is observed in the range 75– <dig> mm nacl with a maximum increase at  <dig> mm, followed by a strong inhibition.

the inhibitor profile of his-rap-b was studied using the l-arg-β-na as substrate. as shown in table  <dig>  the recombinant enzyme shows metallopeptidase properties with an inhibition of its activity with edta and o-phenanthroline in the milli- and micromolar concentrations, respectively. the rap-b activity is not affected by pmsf, a serine protease inhibitor. as expected, aminopeptidase inhibitors such as bestatine  or arphamenine a and b  work in micromolar concentrations. therefore, the recombinant enzyme exhibits the similar enzymatic properties to the testis protein.

the percentage of inhibition was calculated by taking as reference the amount of substrate conversion by his-rap-b in absence of inhibitor . values are the average of three independent series of tests in which each point was performed in triplicate. 

site-directed mutagenesis of the hexxhx18e rap-b motif
in order to probe the functional roles of several amino acids previously identified in other members of the m <dig> family , an investigation of the conserved hexxhx18e motif was conducted by site-directed mutagenesis . mutants were expressed in bli <dig> e. coli strain. the corresponding proteins were then purified or semi-purified either by ni-nta agarose chromatography or deae ion exchange column, respectively and showed a single band on sds-page and western blot, similar to wild type enzyme . conservative mutants such as h325h, e326e, h329h and e348e constituted positive controls.

the number of mutants analysed, the mutated codon and its corresponding amino acid, as well as the percentages of enzyme activity are indicated. the position in the rat ap-b sequence of the targeted amino acid is numbered. the percentage of activity was determined using l-arg β-na as substrate. activity assays were performed in triplicate with enzymes collected from both purification methods.

mutagenesis of any of the three zinc binding ligands of the hexxhx18e conserved motif . as shown by e326q/d and e348q/d mutants, the negative charge and the length of the side chain seem to be important for the glutamate residue functions. on the other hand, results obtained with the h325y/f and h329y/f mutants suggest that nitrogen atoms of histidine play a role in chelating the zn2+ cation.

multiple sequence alignment
in order to establish the basis for molecular modelling and further site-directed mutagenesis studies, we performed a multiple sequence alignment of proteins belonging to the m <dig> family of aminopeptidases. a blastp search of the uniprot database using rat ap-b sequence retrieved  <dig> protein sequences and  <dig> of them were initially selected to perform a clustalw alignment. redundancy inside the selected sequences was conserved to identify partial sequences , sequence insertions and sequencing errors. these latter sequences were deleted from the multiple alignment. consequently,  <dig> proteins varying in length from  <dig>  to  <dig>  amino acid residues were aligned.

examination of the longest sequences  showed that these proteins are translated from a duplicated gene encoding in tandem two similar aminopeptidases of the m <dig> family. the cooh-terminal domains encompassing the second aminopeptidase module of these  <dig> proteins were deleted from the alignment. subsequent alignments of these domains with the consensus signature exhibited identical conserved amino acid residues .

on the other hand, analysis of the shortest sequences revealed interesting data. indeed, these proteins display only one of both consensus motifs of the m <dig> family, the zn2+-binding site hexxhx18e. the second consensus motif gxmen that is classically located about  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids upstream the zn2+-binding motif is missing. the glutamate alone seems to be conserved .

these proteins are encoded by the genomes of actinobacteria . these  <dig> closely related enzymes clearly constitute a sub-group in the m <dig> aminopeptidase family .

the recent publication of the sequence of human aminopeptidase o , an aminopeptidase related to ap-b and lta4h, led us to compare this sequence to that of other members of the m <dig> family. note that the uniprot database only contains the human ap-o sequence . although ap-o is most closely related to ap-b, the global identity between both enzymes is very low . due to a large discrepancy in length  and weak percentages of identity and similarity , the evolutionary relationships between these two proteins remains unclear. in addition, analysis of the m <dig> consensus signature  shows that the gxmen motif is lacking, except the met residue in the ap-o human sequence . this observation was confirmed by analysis of different sequences extracted from the nr database  such as ampo_rat , ampo_mouse , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>   and cag <dig>   . in the m <dig> family, ap-o constitutes the unique member of a second emerging sub-group .

the  <dig> remaining sequences, including ap-b and lta4h proteins, exhibit both consensus motifs of the m <dig> family and thus constitute a third sub-group in the latter. the multiple alignment of these  <dig> sequences, varying in length from  <dig>  to  <dig>  amino acids, permitted the identification of a prominent conserved region of approximately  <dig> residues  containing the gxmen motif and the zn2+-binding site . this region overlaps only  <dig> amino acids residues in the ap-b sequences . this alignment reveals  <dig> highly conserved positions. their conservation among several divergent prokaryote and eukaryote peptidases points their potential importance in maintaining the structural integrity of the proteins or in directly interacting with the substrates.

a subsequent search of the uniprot database with the pattern program for consensus amino acid signatures using conserved residues highlighted in the multiple alignment revealed that the hexxhx3g x6wx6e motif was specific to the m <dig> family . the ex15–45hexxhx3g x6wx6e signature detected specifically all the m <dig> proteins minus the ap-o sequences. the conception of different signatures using other conserved amino acids such as in region 168– <dig> or 409– <dig> failed.

molecular modelling of ap-b
sequence alignments indicated that rat ap-b shares 33% identity and 48% similarity with lta4h. lta4h and ap-b  exhibit similar sizes. consequently, the crystal structure of lta4h constituted a suitable template to model the ap-b 3d structure . the overall structure can be described as follows: ap-b protein is folded into three different nh2-terminal , catalytic  and cooh-terminal  domains packed in a triangular arrangement with dimensions of about  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> Å versus about  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> Å for lta4h. the catalytic centre is located along a deep cleft, created between the three domains. the nh2-terminal domain is composed of a large seven-stranded mixed β-sheet surrounded by two smaller β-sheets. this nh2-terminal domain seems to shape an envelope, such as in lta4h, presenting a large concave surface to the solvent.

the structures of the ap-b and lta4h catalytic domains are very similar. this domain consists of two lobes, one mainly α-helical and one mixed α/β . the zn2+-binding site  in ap-b model remains between the two lobes, such as lta4h  <cit> .

the cooh-terminal domain is formed of α-helices arranged into two layers . the inner layer contains  <dig> parallel α-helices. four anti-parallel helices, with perpendicular loops containing short helical segments on top, compose the outer layer. this coil of helices, also found in lta4h structure, looks like armadillo repeats or heat  motif that are suited for protein-protein interactions  <cit> . the super-helical domain of the lta4h primary structure starts from residue  <dig> and from position  <dig> for ap-b  and it ends with the proteins.

structural analysis
a detailed comparison of both structures highlights differences between ap-b structural model and the lta4h protein structure. the overall percentages of the different secondary structures differ . in a model deleted from the first  <dig> nh2-terminal residues that are non homologous to lta4h due to the difference in length between both proteins, these percentages can be estimated for ap-b to: α-helix, 44%; β-sheet, 15%; loops, 41%. as shown in figure  <dig>  this difference in the percentage of β-sheet is mainly due to the presence of gaps in the alignment and to the weak similarity between both proteins in the nh2-terminal region . further refinement of the structure could probably slightly modify the loop/β relative percentage but the main features described below would be maintained.

the remaining part of the secondary structural alignment exhibits a high homology . a very small parallel two-stranded β-sheet of three amino acids  and a α-helix lying just upstream this β-sheet  are conserved between lta4h and ap-b model . this helical structure carries the first part of the zn2+-binding motif. in both structures, a large α-helix , which contains the third zn2+ligand  is located between the two strands of this small β-sheet. this α-helix is followed by a loop  that forms and limits one side of the substrate binding pocket.

then, in both proteins, another α-helix , perpendicular to the α-helix containing the hexxh motif, carries the lta4h tyr384residue  thought to be the proton donor in the catalytic reaction  <cit> . lastly, a fourth α-helix  takes the primary structure back to the first strand to form the second strand and the small β-sheet. it should be noted that the small parallel two-stranded β-sheet of three amino acids found in ap-b and lta4h is also conserved in f <dig> and epepn structures . this small β-sheet structure might be important because it seems to link and to maintain, without too much rigidity considering its size, two important secondary structures containing conserved residues implicated in catalysis and zn2+ binding.

as described in the lta4h structure  <cit> , a sh <dig> like motif located in a loop  is also found in the ap-b model . however, the ap-b structural model also exhibits a second proline-rich loop in position 47– <dig> . these motifs composed of fairly accessible residues  could constitute putative protein interaction domains.

analysis of the ap-b primary structure revealed the presence of a highly conserved rna binding rnp <dig> motif  usually encountered in eukaryotic hnrnp and snrnp. the whole rnp motif is, in general, composed of two motifs  separated by about  <dig> amino acid residues.

the ap-b rnp <dig> motif  is found in a α-helix upstream the proline-rich loop . rnp <dig> sequence is masked by this loop and a swinging of this latter structure could render the putative rna-binding site accessible to its substrate . the tyr <dig> residue  also belongs to this α-helix. no rnp <dig> consensus sequence is found in the ap-b primary structure.

in order to perform a more precise comparison between the ap-b model and lta4h, the electrostatic potentials of the molecular surfaces of both proteins were computed. figure  <dig> represents electrostatic potential map displayed on the molecular surface of lta4h  compared to the ap-b model . four different orientations with their corresponding 3d ribbon structure are represented showing the  <dig> different sides of both proteins. the potential scale ranges from - <dig> kt/e to  <dig> kt/e . the electrostatic potential distribution between both enzymes is significantly different. rap-b shows a higher negative potential , especially in the catalytic domain. altogether, the α-helix and the β-sheet domains of ap-b seem to exhibit a general negative and neutral/positive potentials, respectively. conversely, the α-helix and the β-sheet domains of lta4h exhibit a general neutral/positive and negative potentials, respectively. interestingly, orientation  <dig> in figure  <dig> shows, in the centre of the ap-b molecule corresponding to the active site , a negative potential versus a neutral/positive potential for lta4h.

hydrophobic patches are predicted to be involved in protein-protein interactions. these patches, defined as clusters of neighbouring apolar atoms deemed accessible on a given surface, were investigated on ap-b and lta4h structures. the total , hydrophobic  and hydrophylic  accessible surfaces of both proteins were determined using the quilt approach. ap-b exhibits a slightly more hydrophobic surface  than lta4h . concerning the lta4h protein, about  <dig> small hydrophobic patches were detected. their surfaces range from  <dig> to  <dig>  Å <dig> and the clusters contain atoms from  <dig> to  <dig> residues. the five larger hydrophobic patches of lta4h  are represented on figure  <dig> and  <dig>  some of these patches seem to be associated on the surface of the molecule and might constitute larger hydrophobic surfaces. the lta4h larger hydrophobic patches are mainly located in α-helical domains.

the surface of ap-b molecule exhibits about  <dig> hydrophobic patches. their surfaces range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å <dig> and these clusters contain atoms from  <dig> to  <dig> residues. the five larger hydrophobic patches of ap-b  are also represented on figure  <dig> and  <dig>  seven other patches, larger than  <dig> Å <dig> , were also detected. as for lta4h, several of these patches seem to be associated . the association of patch  <dig>  and patch  <dig>  constitutes a hydrophobic surface of about  <dig> Å <dig>  if one discards the first largest patch located in an indel region and not yet refined, the second patch is located in the β-sheet domain of the ap-b structure where the second proline-rich loop  is also found. the three others clusters are situated in α-helical domains.

discussion
in this study, we first cloned rat ap-b cds into an e. coli expression vector. the recombinant rap-b was produced with a nh2-terminal histidine tag and was characterized. the results showed that the expressed protein exhibits the same biochemical properties as its rat counterpart, in terms of its immunoreactivity, kinetic parameters, substrate specificity, nacl dependence and inhibitor sensitivity. therefore, this recombinant enzyme was perfectly usable for enzymatic studies.

in order to confirm the functional role of the conserved hexxhx18e motif previously studied in several other enzymes of the m <dig> family , an investigation was conducted by site-directed mutagenesis. as expected, mutagenesis of any of the three zinc ligands of the h325exxh329x18e <dig> motif in rap-b sequence or of the critical general base of the peptidase reaction e <dig> leads to a complete lack of aminopeptidase activity.

in parallel, multiple alignments for the m <dig> family of aminopeptidases were performed to study the conservation of the residues involved in the exopeptidase activity, these residues constituting eventual targets for further site-directed mutagenesis studies. our results clearly demonstrate that  <dig> sub-groups or sub-families constitute the current m <dig> aminopeptidase family. the main difference between these sub-groups is the presence or the partial loss of a gxmen motif upstream the zn2+-binding site. the first sub-family is restricted to actinobacteria . a second sub-family  is composed of only one member expressed in vertebrates . interestingly, numerous site-directed mutagenesis studies of the gxmen motif among the m <dig> family suggested that the glutamate and asparagine residues are implicated in the transition state stabilisation. moreover, these residues, that might interact with the nh2-terminus of substrates, are also suspected to be responsible for the aminopeptidase specificity. the gly residue  seemed crucial for the activity because its replacement with bigger or polar residues abolishes the activity  <cit> . lastly, the mutation of the methionine affects both km and vm, but no precise role of this residue was proposed  <cit> . meanwhile, ito and collaborators  <cit>  demonstrated that this met residue is implicated in the recognition of different substrates, explaining the broad specificity of the enzyme. data about the enzymatic activity of the proteins of the actinobacteria sub-family are not yet available. diaz-perales and collaborators demonstrated in vitro that ap-o is an aminopeptidase with specificity for arg and asn residues  <cit> . further investigation on evolutionary relationships between these proteins and especially on their enzymatic characterization constitute a major goal to grasp the physiological role of these aminopeptidases implicated in fundamental processes of cell metabolism.

in order to investigate the catalytic mechanism of ap-b, we used molecular modelling. in the present work, we generate a molecular model of the whole rat ap-b structure based on the crystal structure of the human lta4h  <cit> . the crystal structures of the tricorn interacting factor f <dig>  and of the aminopeptidase n from e. coli , two other members of the m <dig> family that exhibit less than  <dig> % of identity with lta4h and ap-b, were considered to be not closely related to ap-b. moreover,  <dig> structural domains exist in f <dig>  <cit>  and epepn  <cit> . interestingly, this fourth domain is inserted just upstream the conserved amino acid region highlighted in the multiple alignment . the ap-b model is quite comparable to the lta4h structure particularly at the level of their catalytic domains. examination, in both structures, of the distances between zn2+ ion and the chelating residues his <dig>  his <dig> and glu <dig>  as well as the shape and size of the substrate-binding pocket shows a perfect homology.

the ap-b structural model was also used to examine in silico predicted domains. the ap-b primary structure contains a high consensual rna binding rnp <dig> motif  <cit> . the whole consensus rnp motif is composed of two motifs rnp <dig> and rnp <dig>  both are highly conserved and are usually found in simple or multiple copies . rnp domain folds into a compact and hydrophobic αβ structure . rnp <dig> and rnp <dig> are found in the two central  strands, β4-β1–β3-β <dig>  in ap-b, the absence of rnp <dig> motif and the fact that rnp <dig> is not included in a β-sheet could prevent a functional role in rna binding. indeed, the presence of this rnp <dig> motif could be attributed to a vestigial persistence resulting from gene duplications and a loss of nuclear functions in the course of the evolutionary process. conversely, the presence of a different rnp domain in ap-b structure could lead to the hypothesis that this protein has gained new interactions via new domains and new structures. rnp <dig> might be functional and form a particular structure with another motif than rnp <dig>  indeed, the ap-b primary structure contains putative nuclear localization sequences and some data supports the hypothesis that this exopeptidase could migrate to the nuclear compartment . further studies should demonstrate whether ap-b is also a nuclear protein. in this case, the role of this rnp <dig> motif will remain to be clarified.

the cooh-terminal domains of lta4h and ap-b show a structural region similar to the armadillo repeats or to the heat domains. these folds are usually composed of  <dig> to  <dig> pairs of anti-parallel α-helices that together form superhelices. the α-helices are commonly  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids long in the heat domains and about  <dig> amino acids long in the armadillo repeats. the known proteins containing these motifs share functions in protein-protein interaction/recognition  <cit> . although this putative domain in ap-b and lta4h exhibits shorter α-helices , the super helical fold present in both structures could lead to variations in the strength of interactions and/or to different interacting proteins.

in addition to the potential heat domain, ap-b exhibits several other features, such as putative sh <dig> domains, negative electrostatic potential, large hydrophobic patches leading to the hypothesis that this enzyme might interact with different partners in different functions. these characters are generally different from those of lta4h and have been highlighted by the structural model proposed. differences in the electrostatic potential distribution between ap-b and lta4h might reflect putative  protein-protein interactions. ap-b interacts with the outer cytoplasmic membrane of cells and this interaction might occur by protein-protein interactions  <cit> . ap-b participates, probably with different endopeptidases, to an initial maturation process of neuropeptides and pro-hormones that might involve an endopeptidase/aminopeptidase complex  <cit> . similar roles could be attributed to hydrophobic patches, which delineate putative interacting surface. ap-b exhibits larger hydrophobic patches than lta4h. on the other hand, the negative electrostatic potential at the level of the catalytic site might explain the difference of enzyme specificity and between their respective substrates: rather negative for lta4h, rather positive for ap-b. indeed, a long loop found in both enzymes , delimits and separates the active center from the protein surface. this loop, containing a small α-helix, seems to be involved in substrate specificity as shown by site-directed mutagenesis studies  and structural data . a detailed examination of the corresponding sequences shows that the lta4h sequence is more hydrophobic than the ap-b sequence, the latter exhibiting a high number of basic amino acids. moreover, the distribution of acidic residues shows a significant difference in both loops. they are regularly distributed in the lta4h loop structure and rather gathered up one end of the loop in ap-b, the last aspartate residue belonging to the small α-helix pointing towards the active site.

this might explain the affinity and the positioning of the ap-b substrate. basic peptidic substrates might be attracted to the protein surface and to the active site by the negative electrostatic potential. then, substrate could be guided towards the active center by the presence of hydrophobic and basic residues until stronger interactions occurred involving negatively charged aspartate. the presence of the α-helix might bring some precision and stability to the substrate binding mechanism, balancing the flexibility of the loop.

CONCLUSIONS
the structural model proposed is the first attempt for a better understanding at an atomic scale of the ap-b protein. the ap-b 3d model, based on the fold of lta4h, yields important additional information that open the way to design new experiments. for instance, electrostatic potentials computed here, by nature, are features that can only be calculated from a 3d structure, they result from the superposition of the contribution of all the charges of the atoms in a given point. consequently, a simple sequence analysis cannot foreshadow the electrostatic values. the results we described here illustrate clearly the necessity to go further than simply describing the main fold characteristics to detect fine surface properties of the protein. the important differences in these features compared to lta4h show without ambiguity that the nature or the way the partners interact with ap-b, the environment impact, would be different from lta4h. although the complete range of physiological functions of ap-b remain to be discovered, previous data support the hypothesis that ap-b is involved in a broad spectrum of relevant physiological phenomena. the specific exopeptidase activity of ap-b participates in the final steps of neuropeptides and hormones processing . besides, the enzyme has been implicated in inflammation and/or tumor growth  <cit> . these latter roles might be due to the in vitro residual capacity of ap-b to hydrolyze the lta <dig> into a lipid mediator of inflammation, the ltb <dig>  <cit> . in the absence of high-resolution crystal structure, as demonstrated for aminopeptidase a  <cit>  and numerous other proteins, this model constitutes a powerful tool for investigating the importance and possible roles of conserved residues in ap-b and m <dig> aminopeptidase catalytic sites and to gain new insight into their physiological functions.
