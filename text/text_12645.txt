BACKGROUND
maize exhibits extremely high levels of genetic diversity and phenotypic variation  <cit> . numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms , small insertions-deletions, and large structural variations substantially contribute to this genetic diversity . abundant genetic variation gives rise to great challenges for uncovering the genetic basis of quantitative phenotypic variation.

studies undertaken to understand the genetic architecture of complex traits and their variations in maize have generally been performed by linkage analysis and/or association mapping  <cit> . linkage analysis based on a bi-parental population only detects two alleles and has poor mapping resolution. a genome-wide association study  often identifies spurious associations due to population structure and genetic relatedness  <cit> . joint linkage analysis, using multiple segregating populations, could overcome some of the inherent limitations associated with single population linkage analysis and genome-wide association mapping  <cit> .

to provide an effective genomic resource for joint linkage analysis in maize, us researchers created a nested association mapping  population. about  <dig>  recombinant inbred lines  were created by crossing  <dig> diverse inbred lines with a common parent, b <dig>  <cit> . us-nam has been effectively used with genetic, genomic, and systems biology tools to dissect the genetic architecture of agronomic traits in maize . in addition, analyses with us-nam have been quite accurate at surveying the magnitude of effects across diverse germplasm  <cit> .

one shortcoming of us-nam, however, is its limited number of founder lines; a nam population becomes more effective for gwas when the allele is found in three or more founders  <cit> . additionally, because only one reference line was used in us-nam, the genetic and phenotypic biases introduced into the population are unknown.

to further improve our understanding of the genetic architecture of maize and improve the resolution of quantitative trait loci , chinese researchers independently developed a new nam population . about  <dig>  rils were created by crossing  <dig> diverse elite inbred lines with a common parent huangzaosi . parents of the cn-nam population were selected from different heterotic groups that are widely used in chinese maize breeding  <cit> . combining the cn-nam and us-nam populations can provide a larger genomic resource for dissecting the genetic architecture of complex traits in maize. furthermore, combining populations can enable higher power and higher resolution in genetic mapping through joint linkage analysis.

despite the availability of this new mapping method and the larger mapping population, marker density remains an important limiting factor for identifying genes controlling quantitative traits. this limitation is especially pronounced for fine mapping of qtls. new sequencing technologies have facilitated cost-effective high-throughput snp genotyping for natural and artificial mapping populations. genotyping by sequencing , using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes to reduce genome complexity while retaining good genome coverage of lower copy regions, has proven to be a highly efficient method in different species . yet, gbs-obtained data could be as large as millions of snps, a density that makes the construction of a composite genetic map almost impossible and negates the potential benefits of conducting joint linkage analysis in nam populations.

one strategy to address this issue is to construct a recombination bin map by identifying exact recombination breakpoints and dividing the chromosomal regions into small recombination bins. these small recombination bins can be regarded as an effective type of genetic marker  <cit> . this construction method of sequencing-based high-density genetic maps could substantially reduce the amount of time and effort required for qtl mapping. for example, this method has been used for constructing bin maps of single bi-parental populations and qtl mapping of complex agricultural traits in rice and sorghum . therefore, we expected that recombination bin maps would have the potential to improve the statistical power of joint linkage analysis and reduce the computing time of qtl mapping in nam populations.

the objectives of this study were the following:  to construct high-resolution recombination bin maps of both the us-nam and cn-nam populations based on gbs data;  to evaluate the quality and accuracy of bin maps by joint linkage analysis of a flowering-related trait, days to tasseling; and  to conduct a combined analysis of different nam populations.

RESULTS
identification of high-quality lines
all rils of the  <dig> families that comprised the two nam populations were sequenced with gbs, resulting in a total of one  million snps. after removing monomorphic and maf <  <dig>  snps across all families from the raw gbs data,  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps were obtained for cn-nam with  <dig> families and us-nam with  <dig> families, respectively. based on these snps, we identified outlier lines of two nam populations. after removing the outliers, we obtained  <dig>  and  <dig>  high-quality rils in the cn-nam and us-nam populations, respectively. we used these data for the following analyses.

bin maps of individual families
after removing low-quality snps, the number of high-quality snps ranged from  <dig>  for the huangyesi <dig> family in cn-nam to  <dig>  for the cml <dig> family in us-nam, with the corresponding mean snp density ranging from about  <dig> snp/ <dig>  kb to  <dig> snp/ <dig>  kb, respectively. these snps were used to infer parental genotypes, and detect recombination breakpoints for all available rils, as indicated by fig.  <dig>  the total number of breakpoints per individual family ranged from  <dig>  for  <dig> rils in the huangyesi <dig> family to  <dig>  for  <dig> rils in the cml <dig> family. the average number of breakpoints per individual ril in each family ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . after recombination breakpoint locations were determined, the genotype of each ril was assigned.fig.  <dig> construction of effective recombination bins from raw snps in nam populations. a snp genotypes of both nam populations were obtained by genomic sequencing. a and b represent genotypes from common parents and genotypes from diverse parents, respectively. genotypes indicated by a rectangular box were incorrect due to raw sequencing errors. b bin map was constructed with sequencing snps by recombination breakpoint location.  <dig> and  <dig> represent genotypes from common parents and genotypes from diverse parents, respectively. a hidden markov model was used to correct the error of genotype data



bin maps were constructed for each family based on the identity with the parental genotypes. the number of recombination bins varied substantially among the  <dig> families. the total bin number per individual family ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . more than 50 % of the bins were less than  <dig>  kb in physical length for all families in both cn-nam and us-nam . the median physical length of bins within an individual family ranged from 402 kb for the tzi <dig> family  to 852 kb for the huangyesi <dig> family . detailed bin information for the  <dig> families is provided in additional file 2: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> cumulative distribution of recombination bin sizes within each family of a cn-nam and b us-nam



genetic linkage maps were constructed for each family using bin genotypes. the genetic length of individual family maps ranged from  <dig> .58 cm for the huangyesi <dig> family to  <dig> .58 cm for the cml <dig> family. the average genetic distance between adjacent bins ranged from  <dig>  cm for the cml <dig> family to  <dig>  cm for the huangyesi <dig> family.

bin maps of cn-nam and us-nam
joint recombination bin maps were constructed using  <dig>  and  <dig>  bins  from cn-nam and us-nam, respectively . the physical length of the bins ranged from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  mb  and from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  mb  in cn-nam and us-nam, respectively. in total, 92 % of bins were less than 1 mb in length in cn-nam compared to 94 % in us-nam. subsequently, of the  <dig>  cn-nam bins,  <dig>  with no segregation distortion were used to construct an initial framework genetic map. the remaining markers  with segregation distortion were added to the framework map, and we ensured that no marker order or chromosome position conflicts were introduced. finally, a total of  <dig>  bins were selected to construct a composite genetic map of cn-nam, resulting in a genetic distance of  <dig> .44 cm in length, with an average genetic distance of about  <dig>  cm between adjacent bins. likewise, of the  <dig>  us-nam bins,  <dig>  with no segregation distortion were used to construct a framework map. eventually,  <dig>  bins were selected for the composite genetic map of us-nam, yielding a  <dig> .68-cm genetic length, with an average genetic distance of about  <dig>  cm between adjacent bins .

quality and accuracy of bin maps
the quality and accuracy of these maps for qtl mapping were evaluated by locating the known flowering-time genes for days to tasseling . detailed results can be found in additional file 5: table s <dig> and additional file 6: table s <dig> 

dt, one of the most obvious measures of reproductive growth in maize, is thought to involve male and female flowering-related genes  <cit> . the broad-sense heritability for dt was  <dig>  in cn-nam and  <dig>  in us-nam. therefore, we checked for the presence of known genes involved in the regulatory pathway of flowering time within the interval of dt-related qtls in different genetic backgrounds . for example, zmm <dig>  a maize mads-box gene in the ful <dig> family, promotes floral transition and inflorescence development in maize  <cit> . in this study, four qtls detected under different genetic backgrounds overlapped the zmm <dig> gene, with a likelihood of odd  score ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  and explained  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variation. one of four qtls had its lod peak in bin  <dig> in the m37w family, which encompassed a region of 780 kb in length and completely contained the zmm <dig> locus. within the limits of single-family mapping resolution, the zmm <dig> overlapping dt qtls found in different families is evidence that the individual family bin strategy can produce maps with high quality and accuracy.

further evidence came from mapping the zcn <dig> gene. the flowering time zcn <dig> may function as the florigen and integrates signals from both photoperiod and autonomous pathways in maize  <cit> . we identified qtls overlapping the zcn <dig> region in four families. among the four qtls, the largest effect was detected in the huangyesi <dig> family, explaining 37 % of the phenotypic variation. within the qi <dig> family, two major qtls were detected on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> and completely overlapped the cloned zcn <dig> and zmcct genes .

for qtl mapping of single nam populations, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> qtls were detected for dt in cn-nam and us-nam, respectively . about 46 % and 32 % of the dt-related qtl alleles had a significant effect at p <  <dig>  for cn-nam and us-nam, respectively ; however, only  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  had an additive effect on dt of about 1 day. about 17 % of the dt-related qtls in cn-nam and 28 % in us-nam completely overlapped with the physical position of cloned genes controlling maize flowering time . two well-studied maize flowering-time genes, zcn <dig> and zmcct, were located in qtl regions for both nam populations.fig.  <dig> qtl allele effect size distributions for days to tasseling  within the two maize nam populations. a additive allele estimates for the  <dig> dt qtls for all  <dig> diverse parents relative to common parent hzs in cn-nam. a total of  <dig> qtl alleles were significant at p <  <dig> . b additive allele estimates for the  <dig> dt qtls for all  <dig> diverse parents relative to common parent b <dig> in us-nam. a total of  <dig> qtl alleles were significant at p <  <dig>

joint linkage analysis for combining cn and us nam populations
a composite genetic map for the combined cn-us nam population was constructed based on  <dig>  recombination bins, with a genetic length of  <dig> .48 cm and an average genetic distance of about  <dig>  cm between adjacent bins . when qtl mapping was conducted for dt in the cn-us nam population,  <dig> qtls were detected, which was significantly more than the total qtl number identified in a single nam population . a comparative analysis revealed that six qtls were shared among all three populations . seventeen qtls were shared between cn-us nam and us-nam, and  <dig> qtls were shared between cn-us nam and cn-nam . eight of  <dig> unique qtls in cn-us nam could be found in the single-family qtl mapping for both nam populations .

the average qtl confidence intervals  were  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb in cn-nam and us-nam, respectively. the average ci in cn-us nam was  <dig>  mb; thus, combining populations improved the resolution by about 50 %. the qtl with the largest effect on dt had its lod peak in the region that ranged from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  while a gene zcn <dig> was about 300 kb apart from the peak. the qtl with the second largest effect on dt had its lod peak on chromosome  <dig>  between  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb, while a strong candidate gene zmcct was about 340 kb apart from the peak. therefore, joint analysis for the combined cn-us nam population was effective and valuable for quantitative trait mapping.

power and resolution of qtl mapping using different marker densities
the us-nam population has been phenotyped for days to anthesis  and days to silking  in six environments in the us, and a medium-density composite genetic map was constructed using  <dig>  snps  <cit> . using the high-density composite genetic map of  <dig>  bins, we reanalyzed da and ds using the same phenotype data and mapping method. the number of qtls and the total phenotypic variation explained by all qtls were consistent with the results obtained using the medium-density map . however, with the high-density map, the qtl ci varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm, for da and ds, respectively, with an average ci of  <dig>  cm in both traits; whereas, using the medium-density map, the average qtl ci values were  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm for da and ds, respectively. two major qtls controlling flowering time, vgt <dig> and zmcct, had the most significant effects in us-nam. the vgt <dig> locus could be narrowed down from a 5-mb region on the medium-density map to a  <dig> -mb region on the high-density map. zmcct was located in a  <dig> -mb region on the medium-density map, but could be narrowed to a  <dig> -mb region using the high-density map. these results suggest that recombination bin maps could be effectively used in fine mapping of genes/qtls that control traits of interest.fig.  <dig> qtl mapping for days to anthesis  and days to silking  with different marker density maps in us-nam. a composite genetic map constructed using  <dig>  bins. b composite genetic map consisting of  <dig>  snps published by mcmullen et al.  <cit> . avg ci in  and  represented average qtl confidence interval for da and ds, respectively



discussion
gbs is an efficient and economical method, especially for genotyping ril populations in which regions of extended linkage disequilibrium  are common. we used the gbs method to genotype the us-nam and cn-nam populations and construct the genetic recombination maps for each family within the populations. compared with genetic maps constructed using array-based snp genotyping for the same populations  <cit> , marker numbers significantly increased, reducing the average marker interval. we found substantial biological variation in genetic map lengths per family within the two nam populations.

the largest genetic map lengths in the  <dig> families were likely impacted by residual heterozygosity in the parents. in contrast, the smallest genetic map lengths were in families having large identity by descent  regions with a recurrent parent, for example, the k <dig> and huangyesi <dig> families. the marker density of the composite genetic maps for cn-us nam was also four times higher than that published for us-nam. the composite genetic map length in us-nam was shorter than in cn-nam, which may have resulted from the higher genotype calling error rate in cn-nam due to higher residual heterozygosity.

we noticed that the number of bins generated from our study is slightly different from that of the previous study by giraud et al.  <cit> . in addition to the different populations used, other causes might include different types of genetic markers and the methods used for the analyses. as the gbs markers in our study have a higher missing rate and genotyping error potentially, we are on the conservative side for calling bins. the benefit is the effective reduction of genetic markers for joint linkage analysis by using stepwise regression.

first, we filtered out snps with low quality by using permutations involving resampling of windows of snps followed by bayesian inference  <cit> . then consecutive snps with the same genotype across all rils were lumped into blocks, and a recombination breakpoint was assumed at the transition between two different homozygous genotype blocks. the genotypic maps of the rils were aligned and split into recombination bins  <cit> . finally, after obtaining a skeleton recombination bin map, we further reduced the number of bins by merging bins less than 5 kb apart. consequently, our results do not suggest any reduction of false double recombinant in our analyses.

the quality and accuracy of the genetic maps in this study were confirmed by qtl mapping of flowering-time-related traits. the co-location of major qtls and cloned genes controlling flowering time in maize provided evidence that high-resolution genetic maps are possible using the bin mapping strategy. qtl mapping of cn-nam and us-nam identified  <dig> and  <dig> significant dt-related qtls, respectively. of these identified qtls, 17 % of the cn-nam ones and 28 % of those in us-nam overlapped with previously cloned flowering-related genes in maize. these results illustrate the potential power and reliability of bin-based, composite genetic map construction. hence, we strongly suggest that this method could become an efficient, accurate, and low-cost approach for primary or fine qtl mapping in maize, and other species.

the us-nam analysis of maize flowering-time traits argued for numerous small-effect qtls with additive effects  <cit> . we wondered if this conclusion was the product of the way the parents were selected or was indicative of more general phenomena. to directly evaluate this question, we contrasted the us-nam analysis with a parallel analysis of cn-nam. the common parents of the two nam populations were chosen based on a similar strategy. both hzs in china and b <dig> in the us are very important and widely deployed elite inbred lines in each country’s history of maize breeding. diverse parents of the two nam populations were derived from different germplasm sets. previously, numerous small-effect qtls were identified for flowering time in us-nam, phenotyped for flowering time in six different us environments  <cit> . likewise, flowering time evaluation of us-nam, collected from different chinese environments, showed no evidence for any single large-effect qtl. although we found a higher percentage of significant qtl alleles with additive dt effect in cn-nam  compared to us-nam , no large additive effect was evident. therefore, cn-nam results supported the earlier us-nam finding that flowering-time traits of nam populations were controlled by numerous small-effect qtls with additive effects. additionally, we found a higher percentage of alleles with additive dt effects of about 1 day in cn-nam  compared to us-nam . this result may be due to the bigger difference in flowering times between the common parent and diverse parents in cn-nam compared to those in us-nam.

the power to detect qtl with a high-density map did not improve compared to that using a medium-density map. this is in agreement with results from stange et al.  <cit>  showing that high-density maps could not improve qtl detection power in experimental and simulation data with marker densities of  <dig>   <dig>  and 5 cm. factors influencing the statistical power of qtl mapping include mapping population size, marker density, qtl effect size, and significance level in declaring the existence of qtl. previous studies suggested that the power of qtl detection was little affected by an increase in marker density beyond 10 cm, irrespective of population size and size of qtl effects  <cit> . in our study, the medium-density map had a marker density of  <dig>  cm. hence, higher marker densities provide no advantage on the increase of the qtl detection power.

however, we did find a considerable improvement in mapping resolution using a high-density map compared to a medium-density map. for example, the average lengths of confidence intervals for da- and ds-related qtls were narrowed by 60 % and 47 %, respectively, using the high-density map. this is consistent with results reported by stange et al.  <cit> , where the qtl confidence interval lengths decreased with an increase of marker density regardless of population size and qtl effect size. high-density maps are beneficial for narrowing lod peaks of qtls and improving the precision of qtl localization, since they could increase the probability that a marker is tightly linked to a qtl. in our study, this improved resolution could be beneficial for fine mapping of qtls and for marker-assisted breeding. the two nam populations with high-density marker maps can be used to map qtls for other quantitative traits, improving the power and resolution of qtl mapping. the qtl results detected in these two nam populations can be mutually verified and qtl regions can be further narrowed by determining overlaps with qtls detected in other maize nam populations. accumulation of results by expanding the use of this methodology in other nam populations can provide an excellent platform for the dissection of the genetic architecture of complex agronomic traits in maize.

in this study, we estimated the confidence intervals of qtls by using a 2-lod drop-off method, which is widely used to investigate the qtl mapping resolution  <cit> . although there is potential bias caused by stepwise regression, the chances have not been found that the bias would switch the order for comparing different procedures or methods. this suggests that our conclusion is very likely true in comparing the mapping resolutions by using a single nam population or joint nam populations.

the high density of molecular markers is one important limiting factor for generating high-resolution genetic maps. with ongoing advances in next-generation sequencing, marker density will continue to increase. however, ultra-high density markers will provide additional challenges for constructing genetic maps and conducting joint linkage analyses. choosing representative snps from raw data is one way to produce a genetic map, but other important snp information may be lost. construction of bin maps uses all marker information to accurately evaluate the location of recombination breakpoints. especially in nam populations, we illustrated that this bin map method effectively reduced the computing time of qtl mapping without reducing mapping resolution.

this paper reports that the combination of cn and us nam populations was fruitful for detecting the genetic architecture of complex traits in maize. thus, this method has the potential to pave the way toward fine mapping of complex traits. two additional nam populations have been created within the european cornfed project  <cit> . in the future, the combination of more nam populations with broader genetic diversity can benefit the systematic investigation of genetic architectures of complex traits in maize. in particular, nam populations established based on european germplasm may be a good choice for integration with temperate maize. in contrast, nam populations based on tropical and sub-tropical germplasm may be valuable for investigating important traits such as adaptation and abiotic stress tolerance.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, high-density and high-quality composite genetic recombination maps, based on genomic sequencing data, were generated for two nam maize populations, us-nam and cn-nam. using these maps, we were able to replicate the identification of previously known genes that affect flowering time in maize and improve the resolution of qtl mapping. the combined analysis of different nam populations could improve the power and resolution of qtl detection compared to single nam population mapping. this paper presents the necessary bin maps and computational methods for the maize scientific community to use these populations in their own research.
