BACKGROUND
thermophilic bacteria offer crucial advantages over mesophilic or psychrophilic bacteria, especially when they are applied to ex-situ bioremediation processes. limited biodegradation of hydrophobic substrates caused by low water solubility at moderate temperature conditions can be overcome if the reaction temperature could be increased enough. we previously isolated an extremely thermophilic alkane-degrading bacterium, goebacillus thermoleovorans  b <dig>  from a deep-subsurface oil reservoir in japan  <cit> . strain b <dig> effectively degraded alkanes at 70°c with the carbon chain longer than twelve, dodecane. since tetradecanoate and hexadecanoate or pentadecanoate and heptadecanoate were accumulated as degradation intermediates of hexadecane or heptadecane, respectively, it was indicated that the strain b <dig> degraded alkanes by a terminal oxidation pathway, followed by β-oxidation pathway. recently, another long-chain alkane degrading geobacillus thermodenitrificans ng80- <dig> was also isolated from a deep-subsurface oil reservoir  <cit>  and its complete genome sequence was determined  <cit> .

besides their biotechnological importance, thermophilic microorganisms maintain interesting features useful for studying evolution of life. microorganisms living under extremely high temperature condition, such as hyperthermophilic archaea and hyperthermophilic bacteria, share the cellular mechanisms with not only bacteria but also eukaryotes  <cit> . this is consistent with an evolutionary hypothesis based on a phylogenetic analysis of 16s and 18s rrna genes, that hyperthermophiles are very primitive and are close relatives of the common ancestor of living organisms  <cit> . extremely thermophilic bacteria, that grow under deep subterranean environment, would also add knowledge to the evolution of life because the condition at subsurface is regarded to be more stable than the surface of the earth. although alkane degradation is not a central metabolic pathway of the cells, it would be informative to compare the pathway of thermophilic bacteria with that of mesophilic bacteria and eukaryotes. since most studies on the alkane degradation pathway have been performed on mesophilic microorganisms, such as pseudomonas oleovorans  <cit> , acinetobacter sp.  <cit> , candida tropicalis  <cit> , and yarrowia lipolitica  <cit> , we decided to study on the alkane metabolisms of extremely thermophilic bacteria. recently, a unique alkane monooxygenase that belongs to luciferase family was reported for g. thermodenitrificans  <cit> .

here, we report that two novel membrane proteins, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and acyl-coa oxidase activities were dramatically increased in the cells of g. thermoleovorans b <dig> when they were grown on alkanes. induction of above enzymatic activities upon alkane degradation has never been reported for bacteria but reported for yeast, such as c. tropicalis  <cit> . this result suggests that alkane degradation pathway is at least partly shared by eukaryotes and deep-subsurface thermophilic bacteria.

RESULTS
microscopic observations
the shape of g. thermoleovorans b <dig> cells before and after cultivation in the presence of alkanes was compared with each other by a scanning electron microscope . it was found that the cells became longer and thicker after 14-day growth on alkanes. no such swell was observed for the cells grown in the absence of alkanes . this dynamic change of cell shape prompted us to analyze the cellular proteins produced in relation to alkane degradation.

induction of protein productions by alkanes
comparative analysis of proteins by sds-page showed that production levels of at least three kinds of proteins were increased after 10-day cultivation with alkanes . these were  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda proteins, which were designated as p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively. although a protein band at  <dig> kda  also seems to increase in fig. 2a, reappearance of this phenomenon was not high  and therefore no further work was performed on this protein. when the cells were simultaneously exposed to alkanes in rich nutrient l-broth, where catabolite repression would have probably prevented alkane degradation gene from being expressed, induction of these proteins were not observed. it is of interest that increase in the production level of these three proteins became significant at the time when alkane degradation started . when we tested other hydrophobic substrates, no such induction was observed for palmitic acid, tributyrin, trimyristin, or dicyclopropylketone  which is an inducer of alkane degradation gene expression in p. oleovorans.

the effect of carbon chain length of alkanes on the induction levels of the proteins was examined. it is obvious that the induction effect increases in accordance with the increase in the chain length of alkanes . it has previously been shown that strain b <dig> effectively degrades alkanes longer than dodecane  <cit> . these results strongly suggest that p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> are related to the long-chain-alkane degradation by strain b <dig> or the production of these proteins was stimulated in the consequence of alkane degradation. localization of the proteins in the cell was examined by fractionation of total cellular proteins . because p <dig> was recovered in a soluble fraction after disruption of the cells, this protein is probably a cytoplasmic protein. on the other hand, p <dig> and p <dig> were recovered in an insoluble form, suggesting that they are membrane proteins.

amino acid sequences of p <dig> and p16
the n-terminal amino acid sequences of p <dig> and p <dig> were determined as afplsgvggftisadli  and vpisgvgefxvtfdkl , respectively. these sequences, which are highly similar with each other, showed considerable similarity with that of cholesterol esterase from streptomyces lavendulae  <cit> . cholesterol esterase is a secretion enzyme which hydrolyzes long-chain fatty acid esters of cholesterol and mainly functions in mammalian tissues. in bacteria, only actinomycetes and pseudomonads  <cit>  are reported to produce this enzyme.

cloning and analysis of genes encoding p <dig> and p16
utilizing the information of n-terminal and internal amino acid sequences,  <dig> bp and  <dig>  kb dna fragments encoding a part of p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively, were cloned and their nucleotide sequence was determined. the  <dig> bp fragment was confirmed to encode a part of p <dig> protein, because other internal amino acid sequences idvvvtggnvsgqnlk  and tdnplnvidlsapsltldk  were encoded in the gene fragment. finally,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp open reading frames encoding  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues were obtained for p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively. both p <dig> and p <dig> were suggested to be secretion proteins that are anchored to the cell membrane, because possible signal peptides  were found between the initiation methionine and the n-terminal amino acids of p21-n and p16-n. although cholesterol esterase from s. lavendulae showed relatively high sequence similarity with the n-terminal sequence of p <dig> and p <dig>  the similarity scores became negligible when it compared to the entire  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues . this suggests that p <dig> and p <dig> would not be cholesterol esterase but unique membrane proteins probably responsible for the alkane uptake, tolerance, or degradation pathway in g. thermoleovorans cells. geobacilllus kaustophilus hta <dig> was isolated from deepest sea mud of the mariana trench and the genome sequence has been determined . when we look into its genome sequence, there are genes encoding orthologous proteins to p <dig>  and p <dig> . on the other hand, to our most surprise there is no corresponding gene in the genome of g. thermodenitrificans.

gene expression levels of p <dig> and p16
because p <dig> and p <dig>  which are functionally unknown, were suggested to be membrane proteins, significant amount of these protein bands after  <dig> to 14-day cultivation on alkanes could be due to their accumulation in the dead cell membrane. in order to eliminate this possibility, production of p <dig> and p <dig> was examined at mrna level. the results, which were obtained from northern blotting experiment of p <dig>  are shown in fig. 5a. a strong signal was detected at an expected position of approximately  <dig> bases when rna sample was prepared from the cells after 10-day culture. on the other hand, the probe dna constructed for detecting mrna of p <dig> hybridized with neither of rna samples prepared, suggesting relatively short half-life of the mrna. then, rt-pcr method was adopted in this case, which is reported  <dig> times more sensitive than northern hybridization method  <cit> . when the template rna was prepared from 10-day culture, dna fragment of expected size, ca.  <dig> bp, was clearly amplified by rt-pcr. the amplified dna fragment was confirmed to be a part of p <dig> gene by determining the nucleotide sequence. no dna amplification was observed for rna samples prepared from  <dig> and 4-day cultures .

these results strongly suggest that the production of p <dig> and p <dig> was timely induced by alkanes at a transcription level. because fatty acid, triacylglycerol, dcpk, and paraquat were no efficient inducer of p <dig> and p <dig> production, it is plausible that alkane molecules directly or indirectly control the transcriptional regulation of p <dig> and p <dig> genes.

amino acid sequence of p24
the n-terminal amino acid sequence of p <dig> was determined to be pfelpalpypydalep . this sequence was completely matched with that of superoxide dismutase  from strains in the genus geobacillus. cloning and sequencing of the entire gene encoding p <dig> revealed that it is a mn-dependent type sod of  <dig> amino acid residues, and showed  <dig> % identical to mn-sod of g. kaustophilus hta <dig>  or g. stearothermophilus  and 96% identical to g. thermodenitrificans ng80- <dig> . the amino acid residues responsible for mn binding, 76-ggxxxhxxe- <dig> and 49-qd- <dig>  were completely conserved in p <dig> 

detection of enzyme activities responsible for eliminating reactive oxygen molecules
sod detoxifies superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide, which in turn is generally broken down to water by the function of catalase or peroxidase. the b <dig> cells grown in the presence or absence of alkanes were tested for sod, catalase, and peroxidase activity staining methods. the sod activity of the b <dig> cells grown in the presence of alkane was slightly higher than that of the cells grown in the absence of alkanes as expected . it was found that catalase activity was detectable in the b <dig> cells only when they were grown on alkanes . when  <dig> % glucose or glycerol was used as carbon source in the culture, the activities of sod and catalase remained low. this observation indicates that these enzymes responsible for oxidative stress tolerance were produced as a result of not nutritional starvation  but of alkane metabolisms. on the other hand, neither the sod nor catalase was induced by alkanes in the g. thermoleovorans leh- <dig> cells. although it has been reported that leh- <dig> showed relatively high peroxidase activity irrespective of the presence and absence of alkane in the media  <cit> , this enzyme activity was not detectable level for both the b <dig> and h <dig> cells . interestingly, sod activity in leh- <dig> cells with alkanes was disappeared in the presence of alkanes. this would have been occurred because sod inducible oxygen molecules were mostly consumed by alkane degradation enzymes including acyl-coa dehydrogenase and by regeneration of nad+.

detection of acyl-coa oxidase activity of b23
both the sod and catalase activities were specifically induced by alkanes at the time when strain b <dig> started to degrade alkanes. the sod activity of g. thermoleovorans b <dig> cells was also inducible upon addition of paraquat in the medium, which generates superoxide anion . it seemed most likely that high sod activity was required to detoxify superoxide anion, which was generated as a result of alkane degradation including oxidase reaction. so it is probable that a kind of oxidases catalyzes a step of alkane degradation pathway of g. thermoleovorans b <dig>  therefore, oxidase activity of the b <dig> cells was examined using tetradecane, tetradecanal, tetradecanol, or tetradecanoyl-coa as a substrate. increase in  <dig> nm  after the enzyme reaction was < <dig> ,  <dig> , < <dig> , and  <dig>  for tetradecane, tetradecanal, tetradecanol, and tetradecanoyl-coa, respectively. as far as we know, tetradecanoyl-coa oxidase activity has never been reported for bacteria. as for acyl-coa oxidase in bacteria, the gene encoding short chain acyl-coa oxidase has been cloned from streptomyces fradiae, which forms a biosynthetic gene cluster of macrolide antibiotic, tylosin  <cit> . in both the bacterial cells and mitochondria of eukaryotic cells, the first and rate-limiting step of β-oxidation pathway is catalyzed by acyl-coa dehydrogenase, in which acyl-coa is transformed to enoyl-coa. this acyl-coa dehydrogenase activity is replaced by acyl-coa oxidase in eukaryotic peroxisome  <cit> . peroxisome is an organella which generates and detoxifies reactive oxygen molecules like hydrogen peroxide or superoxide anions. according to the study of alkane degrading yeast candida, peroxisome is highly developed in the cells grown on alkanes or fatty acids  <cit> . the development of peroxisomes in the cells of c. tropicalis grown on oleic acid was accompanied by high level expression of peroxisomal proteins, including acyl-coa oxidase  <cit> . catalase is also a marker enzyme of peroxisome and its activity in candida cells grown on hydrocarbons was much higher than that in the cells grown on lauryl alcohol, glucose or ethanol. although acyl-coa oxidase is reported to increase in the candida cells grown on fatty acids or organic acids, too, neither palmitic acid  nor oleic acid  was an effective inducer for the production of acyl-coa oxidase in g. thermoleovorans b <dig> . the acyl-coa oxidase activity of strain b <dig> showed broad substrate specificity ranging from hexanoyl-coa to octadecanoyl-coa . gene disruption experiments for p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and acyl-coa oxidase have not been successful at this point to conclude that these enzymes are responsible for alkane degradation pathway of the strain. however, dramatic increase in the acyl-coa oxidase, sod, and catalase activities upon alkane degradation strongly suggests that acyl-coa oxidase functions at the initial step of β-oxidation and resulting superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide would be eliminated by cooperative reaction of sod and catalase. this eukaryotic-type degradation mechanism of alkane in g. thermoleovorans cells might reflect chaotic living cell systems of common ancestor under high temperature condition of the primitive earth. evolutional relationship between g. thermoleovorans and peroxisome in the eukaryotic cells are of great interest.

CONCLUSIONS
we, for the first time, suggested that peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway exists in an extremely thermophilic alkane degrading geobacillus thermoleovorans b <dig>  this eukaryotic-type alkane degradation pathway in the bacterial cells might be a vestige of primitive living cell systems that would had evolved into eukaryotes.
