BACKGROUND
the human colon constitutes a protective and nutrient-rich habitat to trillions of bacteria living in symbiosis with the host  <cit> . this complex consortium constantly competes with exogenous microbes for attachment sites in the brush border of intestinal epithelial cells, thus preventing pathogens from entering specific ecological niches and gut tissues  <cit> . pathogens may however overcome this line of defense, leading to different manifestations of disease. infectious gastroenteritis caused by non-typhoidal strains of salmonella enterica spp. enterica is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide  <cit> . due to the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistant and more virulent serovars  <cit> , the use of probiotics with specific anti-salmonella activities is a prevailing interest. mechanisms by which probiotics inhibit pathogens include competition for nutritional substrates and adhesion sites on intestinal epithelial cells, secretion of antimicrobial substances as well as toxin inactivation and host immunity stimulation  <cit> . however, in vivo mechanistic studies of probiotics and gut microbiota are hindered by ethical considerations, compliance issues and high costs. a variety of in vitro gut models have been applied to separately investigate microbe-microbe and simple microbe-host interactions  <cit> . owing to the complexity of the intestinal environment, suitable models accounting for all intestinal parameters including both the gut microbiota and their substrates and metabolic products as well as the presence of epithelial intestinal cells, represent an indispensable platform for preclinical probiosis assessment.

to investigate the complex gut microbiota in vitro, continuous intestinal fermentation models utilizing immobilized fecal microbiota have been developed for the controlled long-term cultivation of gut microbiota with conserved biodiversity  <cit> . such models allow independent testing of different experimental treatments on both gut microbiota composition and metabolic activity within a single experimental period, using the same microbiota under controlled environmental conditions, which are designed to simulate the proximal, transverse and distal colon of healthy and infected subjects  <cit> . more recently, a three-stage in vitro colonic fermentation model of salmonella infection in child colon was used to assess the effects of probiotic and prebiotic treatments on gut microbial behavior and on s. typhimurium infection  <cit> . the activity of microcin b17-producing escherichia coli l <dig> wt  <cit>  and bacteriocinogenic bifidobacterium thermophilum rbl <dig>  both exhibiting strong anti-salmonella activity in simple in vitro tests  <cit> , as well as the microcin b17-negative mutant strain mccb17-, were tested in two three-stage models inoculated with the same fecal inoculum. when added to the colonic model, e. coli l <dig> unexpectedly stimulated salmonella growth in all reactors independently of the microcin b17-phenotype, partly due to a low colonization of the strain in the complex intestinal environment. in contrast, thermophilicin rbl67-producing bifidobacterium thermophilum rbl <dig> revealed high competitiveness and colonized at high levels but did not reduce salmonella counts, most likely a function of the presence of a very high salmonella population in the in vitro model prior to probiotic addition.

most data available on the mechanistic effects of probiotics on the host are derived from in vitro studies with intestinal cells  <cit> . such models have also been used to investigate bacterial interactions with the intestinal epithelium during enteric infection  <cit> . salmonella pathogenesis, for example, has been studied in pure cultures using epithelial caco- <dig> and ht- <dig> cell models  <cit> , both of which lack the ability to produce mucus. the mucus-secreting ht29-mtx cell line however, represents more accurate physiological conditions of the gastrointestinal tract for investigating pathogenic behavior during infection, as the presence of mucus has been shown to enhance pathogenicity of pathogens such as campylobacter jejuni  <cit> . all interaction studies of pathogens and probiotics with intestinal cells have been performed with simple systems of either pure or mixed cultures. microbe cell interactions are however different when tested in the presence of a complex gut microbiota  <cit> . gut metabolites such as scfas affect epithelial cell metabolism, turnover and apoptosis  <cit>  but may also enhance virulence , by inducing an acid tolerance response or increasing expression of porins  <cit> . to our knowledge, the effects of an infected gut microbiota, including its metabolites and probiotic treatment on intestinal cells has not been previously reported.

in this study, the mucus-producing ht29-mtx cell model was used to investigate the interaction of s. typhimurium n- <dig> in presence of a complex intestinal microbiota and to assess the host-protection properties of e. coli l <dig> and b. thermophilum rbl <dig> sequentially inoculated in the infection model, as well as the protective effect of inulin. effluent samples were produced in two three-stage continuous colonic models, mimicking the proximal, transverse and distal colon regions and inoculated with immobilized child fecal microbiota and salmonella, and used to test the effects of probiotics and inulin on gut microbiota composition and metabolism, and on salmonella growth  <cit> . effluents collected from different fermentation periods were directly applied to ht29-mtx cells to measure salmonella invasion and monitor changes in cellular integrity through both measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance  and confocal microscopy. data from complex effluents were compared with pure salmonella cultures.

RESULTS
complex reactor effluents were collected during pseudo-steady states  of different experimental periods from two continuous three-stage colonic fermentation models as indicated in figure  <dig> and applied directly onto confluent mucus-secreting ht29-mtx cells. temporal and environmental factors affecting bacterial growth, salmonella invasion and ter across cell monolayers are summarized in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  ter across cell monolayers after incubation with simple and complex fermentation samples are compared in figure  <dig> and the effects on epithelial integrity upon effluent application are shown in figure  <dig> 

mean transepithelial electrical resistance  ± sd were measured after incubation of ht29-mtx cell monolayers for 1- <dig> h  and  <dig> h  with effluents retained from  proximal,  transverse and  distal colon reactors of f <dig> and f <dig> during the last three days of each experimental period. values with different letters in a row of the same reactor are significantly different according to the tukey-kramer-hsd test . *no treatment effects  were detected on total short chain fatty acid  concentrations . mean scfa concentrations ± sd and  acetate:  propionate:  butyrate ratios measured during the last three days of non-inulin  and inulin  periods are therefore presented. values with different letters in the same column of different reactors are significantly different with the tukey-kramer-hsd test .  initial system stabilization periods,  salmonella infection periods,  e. coli l <dig> treatments,  b. thermophilum rbl <dig> treatments,  prebiotic inulin treatment.

complex reactor effluents affect ter across ht29-mtx monolayers
salmonella were detected neither in reactor effluents nor after invasion assays in samples obtained at the end of initial model stabilization periods . mean ter across ht29-mtx monolayers measured after 1- <dig> h incubation with effluents from initial model stabilization periods  were consistent and similar for all reactors . furthermore cellular tight junctions were unaffected after  <dig> min of incubation, as also demonstrated by confocal microscopy for distal reactor effluents of f <dig> .  <dig> h post-incubation, a significant decrease of ter was recorded . a significantly  higher ter was measured with transverse and distal effluents compared to proximal reactor effluents , correlating with significantly increased scfa concentrations in both r <dig>  and r <dig>  compared to r <dig> .

salmonella invasion is a function of environmental factors and affects epithelial integrity
upon infection of the three-stage continuous fermentation model with s. typhimurium n- <dig> beads , salmonella concentrations in effluents steadily increased and stabilized at significantly  higher levels in proximal  and transverse  compared to distal colon reactors . invasion efficiency expressed as percentage of cell-associated salmonella, was significantly higher with effluents of r <dig>  and r <dig>  compared to r <dig>  . in contrast, invasion efficiency of pure cultures of salmonella in buffered dmem was up to 50-fold higher .

compared to non-infected effluents from initial model stabilization periods , a large and significant mean decrease of ter across ht29-mtx cell monolayers was measured after  <dig> h of incubation with effluents of all reactors from salmonella infection periods . mean ter values did not differ after 1- <dig> h of incubation , but significantly decreased after  <dig> h of incubation . in contrast, ter measured for pure cultures of s. typhimurium n- <dig> in buffered dmem showed a continuous and pronounced decrease in ter . compared to initial model stabilization periods , mean ter measured 1- <dig> h after incubation with effluents of all reactors from salmonella infection periods  were significantly lower , with a mean decrease of  <dig> ± 4% . this effect on cell integrity was confirmed by confocal microscopy analysis which demonstrated highly disrupted tight junctions after salmonella infection for distal reactor  effluents of f <dig>  compared to initial model stabilization periods .

e. coli l <dig> stimulates salmonella growth yet reduces invasion in the distal colon region
e. coli l <dig> established itself in the three-stage model at low levels with slightly but non-significantly higher numbers measured in r <dig>  compared to r <dig>  and r <dig> .

as shown previously  <cit> , the addition of e. coli l <dig> beads to the intestinal fermentation model enhanced salmonella growth in all colon reactors compared to initial salmonella infection periods . however, significantly lower salmonella invasion ratios were measured with transverse and distal reactor effluents  in comparison with initial salmonella stabilization periods . concomitantly, salmonella adhesion ratios remained stable in r <dig> , however the efficiency of cell-associated salmonella to invade ht29-mtx cells  decreased significantly. the second addition of e. coli l <dig>  had no further effects on salmonella adhesion and invasion ratios in r <dig> and r <dig>  however, a significantly enhanced  salmonella invasion ratio was measured with transverse reactor effluents  compared to the first e. coli l <dig> period , which was accompanied by a significant increase in invasion efficiency .

similar mean ter values were measured with effluents from first e. coli l <dig>  and salmonella colonization  periods for all reactors , despite significantly higher salmonella counts  after the addition of e. coli l <dig> . ter significantly  decreased by 19% and 26% with transverse and distal reactor effluents respectively  after the second addition of e. coli l <dig>  compared to the previous period  while salmonella counts did not change for the two e. coli periods .

b. thermophilum rbl <dig> exerts a protective effect on epithelial integrity in highly infected environments
b. thermophilum rbl <dig> colonized all reactors of the two three-stage fermentation models, reaching high counts of  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  log <dig> mcn/ml in r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig>  respectively . addition of b. thermophilum rbl <dig> beads increased salmonella counts in r <dig> compared to the previous e. coli l <dig> treatment . however, salmonella invasion efficiency did not change for any of the reactors and the invasion ratio measured with transverse reactor samples significantly decreased during bif compared to ecol ii periods .

b. thermophilum rbl <dig> addition  significantly  increased the mean ter measured across ht29-mtx cell monolayers applied with effluents of all reactors by  <dig> ± 17% compared to previous e. coli l <dig> period . mean ter measured after  <dig> h of incubation with effluents from proximal reactors  was similar  to initial model stabilization periods  before salmonella infection . confocal microscopy analysis revealed high integrity of intracellular junctions upon application of distal colon reactor effluents of f <dig> after addition of b. thermophilum rbl <dig>  despite high salmonella counts .

inulin stimulates b. thermophilum rbl <dig> growth but increases salmonella invasion in proximal colon environments
addition of inulin induced a significant  increase in salmonella counts  in r <dig> compared to previous b. thermophilum rbl <dig> periods . furthermore a pronounced enhancement of b. thermophilum rbl <dig> growth  and an increase in scfa concentrations and butyrate ratios  occurred in all reactors. inulin supplementation in r <dig> was accompanied by a significant  increase in the efficiency of salmonella to invade ht29-mtx cells compared to the previous b. thermophilum rbl <dig> period . this effect was not significant for transverse and distal reactor samples. inulin treatment also induced a 25%-decrease  in ter after 1- <dig> h of incubation for effluents of r <dig> compared to the previous b. thermophilum rbl <dig> periods , while a similar but less pronounced tendency was observed for transverse and distal reactors.

discussion
accurate assessment of probiotic-mediated anti-salmonella activities is complicated by the fact that mechanisms involved in enteric protection are the function of many probiotic features. various interactions take place in complex gut environments, including competition for substrates, direct antagonism by the production of inhibitory substances , competitive exclusion, and potentially host-mediated effects such as improved barrier function and altered immune response  <cit> . it is therefore crucial to consider microbe-microbe as well as host-microbe interactions for the development of probiotics with targeted efficacy. beyond animal in vivo models, combinatorial in vitro systems using both gut fermentation and cell models are an integral component in system biology approaches aimed at developing new probiotics  <cit> . for example, the dynamic tno-gastrointestinal system  of the human small intestine combined with the caco- <dig> cell model was used to investigate the digestive stability and intestinal absorption of lycopene and α-tocopherol  <cit>  furthermore, adhesion to and cytokine expression of caco- <dig> cells was assessed using bacterial cultures, including the probiotic strain bifidobacterium longum dd <dig>  obtained from a three-stage continuous-culture system  simulating the proximal and distal large intestine  <cit> . results clearly indicate that application of fermentation effluents to intestinal cells represents a valuable platform for assessing epithelial responses as a function of in vitro fermentative processes and microbial interactions. in this study, a three-stage continuous intestinal fermentation model closely mimicking conditions in the proximal, transverse and distal colon regions and inoculated with immobilized child feces was used to generate a complex microbiota. for the first time, we report the effects of salmonella in a complex gut microbiota containing metabolites and grown under environmental conditions of the different sections of the colon, on mucus-secreting intestinal ht29-mtx cells. this combined model approach was used to assess host-protecting, anti-salmonella activities of probiotic and prebiotic combinations.

mean invasion efficiencies of s. typhimurium n- <dig> into ht29-mtx cells measured in colonic effluents were up to 50-fold lower compared to values measured in simple experimental conditions of a single salmonella strain in dmem, reflecting different microbe cell interactions in simple systems compared to environments with a complex gut microbiota  <cit> . bacterial interactions occurring at the brush-border of ht29-mtx cells may enhance barrier function and diminish salmonella invasion capacity, through the presence of a complex host microbiota, specific metabolites, as well as competition for adhesion sites. scfas at physiological concentrations are known to induce a concentration-dependent, reversible change in cellular permeability in vitro  <cit> . a higher concentration of total scfas in fecal water of adults applied to caco- <dig> cells was shown to be associated with an increase in ter in comparison to fecal water obtained from elderly subjects containing lower scfa concentrations which negatively affected epithelial barrier function  <cit> . our results obtained with effluents sampled at the end of model stabilization periods  were in accordance with these findings. indeed, a generally higher ter across ht29-mtx cell monolayers was measured after  <dig> h of incubation for transverse and distal reactor samples with a high concentration of scfas accumulating in the in vitro model due to the lack of absorption, compared to samples from the proximal reactor. in general, lower ter values were measured during all experimental periods and for all reactors upon effluent exposure for  <dig> h compared to 1- <dig> h. as reactor effluents contain a dense and active microbiota, bacterial fermentation and ph reduction can occur during intestinal cell incubation which can negatively affect cell viability thus epithelial integrity  <cit> .

salmonella invasion is influenced by environmental factors such as ph or scfa concentrations. upon infection salmonella invasion was generally higher in distal reactors  compared to proximal  and transverse  reactors and inversely related to scfa concentrations. these results are consistent with findings of durant et al.  <cit> , demonstrating that salmonella entry into hep- <dig> cells was higher at ph  <dig> compared to ph  <dig> in the presence of  <dig> mm acetate,  <dig> mm propionate and  <dig> mm butyrate. a lower percentage of cell-association and invasion was observed as the concentration of each scfa increased at ph  <dig> but not at ph  <dig>  <cit> . salmonella invasion into intestinal cells is known to be associated with a rapid disruption of epithelial integrity caused by structural modifications of intercellular junctions that can be assessed by ter measurements  <cit> . in this study, we effectively demonstrated that effluents obtained from three-stage in vitro colonic fermentation models of salmonella infection and applied directly on confluent and fully differentiated ht29-mtx cells induces a large and significant decrease of ter after  <dig> h of incubation, compared to non-infected effluents . visualization of tight junctions by phalloidin staining revealed that intracellular junctions of ht29-mtx cells were not affected by the gut microbiota produced during initial model stabilization  but were highly disrupted in the presence of salmonella . this is in accordance with results published by jepson et al.  <cit>  where incubation of mdck monolayers with s. typhimurium sl <dig> for  <dig> min was accompanied by a disruption of intracellular junctions.

addition of e. coli l <dig> enhanced salmonella growth in all reactors although the efficiency of salmonella in invading ht29-mtx cells significantly decreased in distal reactor  samples. after the addition of b. thermophilum rbl <dig>  the invasion efficiency of salmonella decreased most in proximal reactors , despite higher salmonella counts compared to previous ecol ii periods. these results may reflect the influence of environmental requirements for optimal growth of the tested probiotics. b. thermophilum rbl <dig> is acid tolerant and a competitive bacteriocinogenic bacteria  <cit> , a trait likely advantageous for competing with other members of the bacterial ecosystem present in proximal colon reactors at ph  <dig> . indeed, b. thermophilum rbl <dig> best colonized and reduced salmonella invasion into ht29-mtx cells at ph  <dig>  with proximal reactor samples, while e. coli l <dig> was more competitive at ph  <dig>  in distal colon reactors.

the presence of e. coli l <dig> in the fermentation model not only enhanced salmonella growth but also induced further disruption of epithelial integrity, a finding which was unexpected. a similar decrease in ter was observed for t <dig> cells when preventively incubated with e. coli nissle  <dig> before addition of s. dublin  <cit> . in contrast, ter values and epithelial integrity after b. thermophilum rbl <dig> addition were significantly enhanced in all reactors of both models although salmonella counts were very high. several studies reported that live gram-positive probiotics are able to enhance monolayer barrier function and protect cultured epithelial cells from the effects of infection with invasive pathogens. preventive treatments with lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus thermophilus, for example, were shown to prevent the enteroinvasive escherichia coli -induced decrease in ter of ht29/cl 19a cell monolayers  <cit> . bifidobacterium infantis and bifidobacterium breve of the probiotic cocktail vsl# <dig>  were shown to improve epithelial integrity of t <dig> cells and resistance to salmonella invasion  <cit> . it was suggested that gram-positive and gram-negative probiotics use different mechanisms to beneficially modulate the intestinal epithelium and to mediate protection against salmonella  <cit> . indeed, the ability of e. coli nissle  <dig> and the probiotic mixture vsl# <dig> to diminish salmonella dublin-induced death of t <dig> cells was related to the induction of il- <dig> secretion by the gram-negative probiotic, while the gram-positive probiotic mixture was shown to prevent pathogen-induced decrease in ter and stabilize tight junctions.

among scfas, a special function is assigned to butyrate. in the gut lumen, butyrate is used by epithelial cells as an energy source whereas in tumor cells  butyrate reduces survival by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation  <cit>  with concentrations ≥  <dig> mm being shown to reduce ter of caco- <dig> cells  <cit> . a similar effect was observed in this study. inulin induced a strong bifidogenic effect and a shift in scfa ratios, with a strong increase in butyrate concentrations , accompanied by a decrease in ter.

CONCLUSIONS
our results highlight the benefits of combining suitable cellular and colonic fermentation models to evaluate host protection activity of probiotics during salmonella infection in the presence of commensal gut organisms, providing efficient tools for mechanistic studies in vitro which may enhance preclinical development of new antimicrobials. the application of a complex microbiota produced in an in vitro fermentation model to ht29-mtx cells revealed that optimal environmental conditions and the impact on salmonella infectivity and intestinal epithelial integrity differed for both probiotic strains tested. e. coli l <dig> remained at low levels but preferentially colonized the simulated distal colon and also stimulated salmonella growth which was accompanied by a significant disruption of epithelial integrity. in contrast, b. thermophilum rbl <dig> was very competitive and established itself at high levels preferentially in proximal colon reactors. its presence induced a high increase in ter after  <dig> h of incubation in all reactors and both models to levels similar to that measured before salmonella addition. additional studies examining cellular immune responses, including utilizing fecal material from other donors to account for differences in individual gut ecosystems, are necessary in further elucidating the mechanisms of b. thermophilum rbl <dig> and e. coli l <dig> for treatment of salmonella infections prior to large-scale and costly in vivo trials.
