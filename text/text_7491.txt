BACKGROUND
medical imaging techniques have obtained great development in the past decades and have been found different applications in disease diagnosis. one of these important imaging techniques is ultrasound imaging. ultrasound imaging has many advantages such as noninvasiveness, portability, and low price, which make it attractive to different clinical applications  <cit> . however, the quality of ultrasound images is greatly affected by speckles, a granular pattern formed due to coherent interferences of backscattered echoes from the scatters  <cit> . the presence of speckle degrades the quality of ultrasound images, and thus affects diagnosis. thus, speckle reduction has become an important task in many applications with ultrasound imaging.

different methods have been investigated for speckle reduction. these methods include early methods such as lee filter  <cit> , frost filter  <cit> , kuan filter  <cit> , and recently developed methods such as adaptive filters  <cit> , wavelet transform  <cit> , bilateral filters  <cit> , nonlocal-means  <cit>  and anisotropic diffusion filters  <cit> , etc. in  <cit> , an adaptive weighted median filter  for speckle reduction is proposed. different from the common median filter, awmf adjusts weight coefficients and smoothing characteristics based on the local statistics. in  <cit> , an adaptive speckle suppression filter  is developed for speckle reduction in b-scan images. the proposed filter used appropriately shaped and sized local filtering kernels and has better adaptation to local variations. in  <cit> , a speckle suppression method is presented for ultrasound images. in the presented method, the original image was first logarithmically transformed, and then 2-d wavelet transform was applied to obtain multiscale decomposition for speckle reduction. besides the methods described above, anisotropic diffusion filters  <cit>  have been studied deeply in recent years  <cit> . in  <cit> , an anisotropic diffusion method which integrated with the smallest univalue segment assimilating nucleus  edge detector was proposed. the proposed method can provide good performance in both speckle reduction and detail preservation. in  <cit> , a nonlinear coherent diffusion  model for logarithmic compressed b-mode ultrasound images was developed. the proposed method can work in real-time. in  <cit> , yu et al. proposed the speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion  method for ultrasonic images. the method integrated spatially adaptive filter into the diffusion technique, and exploited the instantaneous coefficient of variation for edge detection. compared with previous method, the method has better performance in both edge preservation and speckle reduction. in addition, the srad has been further applied to 3d ultrasound images  <cit>  and also obtained good performance. recently, another improvement for anisotropic diffusion filter is the work in  <cit> . in  <cit> , tauber et al. improved the robustness of the original srad by following the analysis of p-m method with respect to the robust estimation of a piecewise smooth image. inspired by the success of the work  <cit> , we will further improve the robustness of the dpad in this paper.

RESULTS
in order to test the performance of the proposed method, we have performed several experiments on ultrasound images. the proposed method was compared with the srad algorithm  <cit>  developed by yu and the dpad algorithm developed by aja-fernandez  <cit> .

experimental results for speckle reduction
we performed several experiments to test the performance of the proposed method. in the experiments, the ultrasound images used were from cattle's follicles. figure  <dig> and figure  <dig> show two of these original images. figure  <dig> and 2's ,   show the experimental results from different methods . the number of iterations was set to  <dig>  for testing the capability of detail preservation of the proposed method, we compared the pixel values extracted from a blue line as shown in figure  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the intensity values of the blue line after speckle reduction with srad and rdpad when the number of the iteration is  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively. experimental results shown in figure  show that all of these three diffusion methods can reduce the speckles effectively. however, the dpad doesn't stop diffusion when the number of iterations is increasing. this resulted in smoothed image and many details were lost. the proposed rdapd method can preserve the details in the diffused image. we also compared our method with the nonlocal-means method. the result obtained by nonlocal-means method for image in figure  <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  from the experiments, we also find that nonlocal-means method can also reduce the speckles while preserving some details. however, compared with nonlocal-means method, the proposed method also enhanced the edges. this can also be visually inspected in figure  <dig>  which shows the diffusion results obtained by different methods with different iteration times. from the experiments, we can find that rdapd is less sensitive to the number of iterations, which is another advantage of rdapd over srad and dpad since the number of iterations in diffusion based methods is generally an important parameter.

in order to compare the effectiveness of speckle reduction on segmentation, we used active contour without edge  developed in  <cit>  to extract the follicle boundaries from ultrasound image. figure  <dig> shows the contours of the follicles extracted manually from the original image, and the results extracted by acwe from the images after speckle reduction with srad, dpad, nonlocal-means, and the proposed method. figure  <dig> shows that the final contours obtained from the images pre-processed by srad and dpad are away from the boundary obtained manually while the follicle boundaries obtained from the images pre-processed by nonlocal-means and our rdpad are closed to the boundary obtained manually. the experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance for speckle reduction.

quantitative comparison of speckle reduction methods
for quantitative comparison, we used the measurement developed in  <cit> . the measurement used in  <cit>  can be used to measure the region contrast of an image. as is known, a better speckle reduction method should preserve edges while reducing speckle. thus we can use the region contrasts in homogenous regions and edge points before and after speckle reduction to measure the effectiveness of each diffusion method. the region contrast cw in an image i is defined as  <cit> :

  cw=1m∑wclog) 

where the local contrast at pixel , c is defined as

  c=4×i-{i+i+i+i} 

where i is an image pixel intensity value, w is a region of image , and m is the number of pixels in the region w over which the contrast is evaluated. in the experiments, we selected manually a homogeneous region and a set of edge points for measuring the performance of each method, which is shown in figure  <dig>  table  <dig> shows the rc values from the selected homogeneous region and the selected set of edge points. based on table  <dig>  srad and dpad can reduce the speckles in the selected homogeneous region effectively, but the cr values of the selected set of edge points are reduced. however, the proposed method can preserve the contrast of the edge points and can remove the speckle in the homogenous region effectively.

discussion
the proposed speckle reduction can be applied as a preprocessing step for image segmentation  <cit> . because ultrasound image segmentation will be affected by speckles, a good speckle reduction method will enhance the performance of image segmentation. although we have shown some improvement of segmentation after speckle reduction, the number of cases is not big, thus our future work will focus on measuring the performance of speckle reduction on segmentation using large set of ultrasound images.

another potential application is the extension of the proposed method to 3-d speckle reduction in ultrasound images. as is well known, 3-d ultrasound imaging is a more challenging area than 2-d ultrasound imaging. based on our current experiments, we predict the proposed method can also get good results for 3-d ultrasound images.

CONCLUSIONS
by integrating the detail preserving anisotropic diffusion developed by aja-fernandez and the diffusion coefficient function from  <cit> , we developed a new anisotropic diffusion filter which can have better performance in edge preservation and speckle reduction. due to the favorable property of "edge-stopping" diffusion, the proposed method is less sensitive to the number of iterations. experimental results on real ultrasound images indicated that the proposed method can achieve better performance than both srad and dpad. the proposed method provides a preprocessing method for ultrasound image segmentation.
