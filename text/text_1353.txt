BACKGROUND
the facultative intracellular bacterium salmonella enterica causes a broad spectrum of diseases, such as gastroenteritis and bacteremia, which are typically acquired by oral ingestion of contaminated food or water. s. enterica serovar typhimurium  causes enterocolitis in humans and a typhoid-like systemic infection in mice.

several virulence genes associated with salmonella pathogenicity islands  and the virulence plasmid have been characterized in s. typhimurium. two type iii secretion systems  encoded by spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> play central roles in salmonella pathogenesis. spi- <dig> is essential for the invasion of host cells and the induction of apoptosis in infected macrophages  <cit> . spi- <dig> t3ss primarily confers survival and replication on macrophages and is required for systemic infection in the mouse infection model  <cit> . expression of spi- <dig> genes is induced within a modified phagosome, called the salmonella-containing vacuole , in infected macrophages  <cit> . induction of spi- <dig> genes depends on a two-component regulatory system, ssra/ssrb, encoded within the spi- <dig> region  <cit> . expression of ssrab is also mediated by two-component regulatory systems, ompr/envz and phop/phoq, which sense osmotic stress and cation limitation, respectively  <cit> . in addition, a global transcriptional regulator, slya, which interacts directly with the ssra promoter region, is involved in the expression of spi- <dig> t3ss  <cit> .

during infection of mammalian hosts, s. typhimurium has to rapidly adapt to different environmental conditions encountered in its passage through the gastrointestinal tract and its subsequent uptake into epithelial cells and macrophages. thus, establishment of infection within a host requires coordinated expression of a large number of virulence genes necessary for the adaptation between extracellular and intracellular phases of infection. it has been demonstrated that the stringent response plays an important role in the expression of salmonella virulence genes during infection  <cit> .

the stringent response is mediated by the signal molecules, guanosine tetraphosphate  and guanosine pentaphosphate  , which accumulate in bacterial cells and exert both positive and negative effects on the transcription of many genes. ppgpp plays an important role in the virulence of pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . in gram-negative bacteria, ppgpp is synthesized by two tynthases, the synthase i and the synthase ii, which are encoded by the rela and spot genes, respectively  <cit> . these enzymes respond differently to environmental conditions. rela is activated by the binding of uncharged trna to ribosomes upon amino acid starvation. spot is induced during the exponential growth phase and responds to other changes in environmental conditions, specifically a lack of carbon sources or energy deprivation  <cit> . ppgpp binds directly to the β and β' subunits of rna polymerase , leading to destabilization of the rnap-rrna promoter open complex  <cit> . moreover, the stringent response is increased by the availability of free rnap, which gives rise to σ competition  <cit> . ppgpp indirectly activates the expression of many stress-induced genes by its release from rnap σ70-dependent promoters and by facilitating the use of alternativeσ factors. it has been shown that ppgpp is not only essential for surviving periods of stress but also for the interaction of bacteria with their host  <cit> .

in case of s. typhimurium, a mutant strain deficient in both rela and spot  shows marked reductions in both bacterial invasion into host cells and proliferation in macrophages  <cit> . furthermore, the virulence of the ΔrelaΔspot mutant is severely attenuated in mice  <cit> . ppgpp controls the expression of spi- <dig> to - <dig> and spv through their transcriptional regulators hila, invf, rtsa, ssra, slya, and spvr  <cit> . these observations indicate that ppgpp may play a major role in salmonella virulence via the altered expression of regulatory genes. because ppgpp has been shown to affect the expression of many virulence genes in s. typhimurium, it is likely that there are additional virulence genes among the ppgpp-regulated genes.

in this study, we constructed an agarose 2-dimensional electrophoresis  reference map of s. typhimurium grown under amino acid starvation to identify ppgpp-regulated proteins from whole-cell preparations. by comparative proteomic analysis of ppgpp-regulated and salmonella-specific proteins, we identified a novel virulence factor, stm <dig>  required for intracellular survival within macrophages.

RESULTS
agarose 2-de reference map of s. typhimurium with induced stringent responses
because the correlation between mrna and protein expression levels is nonpredictive, the direct measurement of protein expression is essential for the analysis of biological processes  <cit> . 2-de allows several hundred proteins to be displayed on a single gel, thus producing a direct and global view of the proteome at a given time point  <cit> . agarose 2-de takes advantage of the process of protein separation over a broad range  <cit> . in this study, to separate and identify more proteins, we applied agarose 2-de to the bacterial proteome, and also used 12% and 15% sds-page gels for the second dimension. whole-cell proteins were obtained from the s. typhimurium strain sh <dig>  a derivative of atcc  <dig>  with the stringent response induced by serine hydroxamate, as described previously  <cit> . agarose 2-de was performed at least three times on independent samples. more than  <dig> protein spots from the strain were detected on each 2-de gel stained with coomassie brilliant blue. to identify proteins on the agarose 2-de gels, we excised  <dig> spots from the 12% gel and  <dig> spots from the 15% gel. we finally identified a total of  <dig> proteins  by ms/ms analysis out of  <dig> protein spots  that were successfully excised . in total,  <dig> proteins were obtained from the gels, with  <dig> proteins identified as being redundant. the highest and lowest molecular masses of identified proteins were  <dig>  kda for acnb  and  <dig>  kda for cspc , respectively. fifty spots  were found in a basic range. interestingly,  <dig> protein spots  were annotated as putative proteins on the genome of the s. typhimurium lt <dig> strain, which is more than 98% identical in sequence to the  <dig> strain  <cit> .

we estimated the molecular weight of the protein spots on the 2-de gels and compared them with the theoretical molecular weight of strain sh <dig>  while most of the estimated molecular weight values matched the theoretical values, we found  <dig> protein spots on the map that had different experimental and predicted molecular weights values . these proteins might be post-translationally modified by proteolytic processing, phosporylatoin of multiple amino acid residues and/or an artifact caused by sample preparation. for example, the experimental molecular weight of ompa indicated that the protein was likely processed by a proteolytic enzyme, because two different spots  were identified as ompa, the experimental masses of which were significantly lower than the theoretical values. similar results were described in other reports  <cit> .

next, we classified proteins identified on the map using the kegg pathway database. while  <dig> proteins  were classified into several metabolic categories ,  <dig> proteins  were grouped in the no entry category, which means that these proteins do not belong to the other categories. this category contained  <dig> known virulence-associated proteins, including flagella and flagella biosynthesis proteins , spi- <dig> effectors , an spi- <dig> translocase , an iron transporter , superoxide dismutases , a quorum-sensing protein , a two-component response regulator , peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases , and a periplasmic disulfide isomerase .

identification of ppgpp-regulated proteins using comparative proteomics
to identify proteins associated with the stringent response in s. typhimurium, we compared the agarose 2-de pattern for each total protein prepared from amino acid-starved s. typhimurium sh <dig> and ΔrelaΔspot strain  . as shown in table  <dig>   <dig> protein spots  were found at higher levels in sh <dig> than in tm <dig>  while  <dig> protein spots were found at lower levels in sh <dig> than in tm <dig>  we focused on  <dig> proteins, which were positively regulated by ppgpp in the stringent response.

and, not determined.

bec, already identified as a ppgpp-regulated protein in e. coli by traxler et al.  <cit> .

cmrna level was significantly different between wild type and the ΔrelaΔspot mutant.

of these proteins, six genes  had previously been identified as ppgpp-regulated genes in e. coli at the transcriptional level  <cit> . in s. typhimurium, it has been shown that ppgpp controls the expression of known virulence-associated genes, including sipc, fliy, sopb, and sodc <dig>  in response to growth conditions relevant to host infection  <cit> . thus, to confirm the results from the comparative proteomic analysis, mrna levels of the remaining  <dig> genes were assessed by qrt-pcr. as a result, mrna expression levels of eight genes  were significantly higher in sh <dig> than in tm <dig> under stringent conditions .

identification of novel virulence-associated factors regulated by ppgpp
among  <dig> genes newly identified as ppgpp regulated,  <dig> genes were present in non-pathogenic e. coli k- <dig> strain. therefore, to examine whether ppgpp-regulated putative or hypothetical proteins could contribute to the virulence of s. typhimurium, we chose salmonella-specific protein, stm <dig>  which is present in s. typhimurium, but is absent in the e. coli k- <dig> strain . to determine the roles of stm <dig> in virulence, a deletion mutant was constructed in the s. typhimurium wild-type sh <dig> strain, and its virulence was assessed by a mouse mixed infection using a competitive index analysis. as shown in figure 5a, mouse mixed infections showed that disruption of the stm <dig> gene conferred a defect in virulence in mice, and that successful complementation was achieved for th <dig>  by expression of intact stm <dig> from a plasmid. these findings provide the first evidence that stm <dig> functions as a virulence factor of s. typhimurium in a mouse infection model.

because it is believed that intracellular salmonella is likely to be restricted to the acquisition of nutrient substrates from infected host cells, the stringent response could occur in scv. thus, we next analyzed the contribution of stm <dig> to intracellular survival of s. typhimurium in macrophages. in accordance with previous data that a ppgpp <dig> mutant strain deficient in both spot and rela genes resulted in a severe reduction of intracellular proliferation and suvival  <cit> . in contrast to the wild-type level of invasion, intracellular survival of th <dig> in raw <dig>  cells was reduced, compared with that of the wild-type strain. the reduced cfu of th <dig> in ifn-γ treated-raw <dig>  cells was not more severe than that in the ΔrelaΔspot double mutant, Δssav , and Δssrb  strain, but was equal to that in the Δssef  strain . these results suggest that the expression of additional virulence factors, like stm <dig>  in macrophages might be affected in a highly avirulent phenotype of a ppgpp-deficient strain in mice.

stm <dig> is regulated by the spi- <dig> transcriptional regulator ssrb
it has been demonstrated that ppgpp mediates the expression of virulence-associated genes involved in bacterial invasion and intracellular growth and survival via global and/or gene-specific transcriptional regulators in s. typhimurium  <cit> . since intracellular growth and suvival of salmonella in macrophages is dependent upon spi- <dig> function, we next confirmed whether expression of stm <dig> is regulated by the ssrab two-component system, which positively controls the expression of spi- <dig> genes as well as other genes belonging to the ssrb regulon  <cit> . to test this, we constructed s. typhimurium strains carrying stm3169::lacz transcriptional fusions on the chromosome in the wild-type  and ΔrelaΔspot  genetic background. salmonella strains carrying the stm3169::lacz fusion gene  were grown in defined mgm medium  with  <dig> % casamino acids and measured β-galactosidase activity. the transcription levels of stm3169::lacz fusion were significantly decreased in tm <dig> . the reduced level was restored to the wild-type level by the introduction of an arabinose-inducible plasmid expressing his6-tagged rela protein. we next transduced the ssrb mutation  into a stm3169::lacz fusion strain . strains carrying the stm3169::lacz fusion gene with the ssrb mutation were grown in mgm medium , and β-galactosidase activity was measured. control experiments were performed with the ssag::lacz fusion gene . ssag expression is strongly controlled by ssrb  <cit> . similar to ssag::lacz, the transcription level of the stm3169::lacz fusion gene was significantly decreased in strains carrying the ssrb mutation . complementation was partially achieved for tm <dig> by expression of ssrb  on a plasmid , probably due to the constitutive expression of ssrb from multi-copy-number palsmid pflag-ctc. collectively, these data suggest that the novel virulence-associated factor stm <dig> was regulated by the spi- <dig> two-component regulatory system ssrab as well as by ppgpp.

it has been reported that ppgpp regulates spi-2-encoded genes under aerobic condition  <cit> . to further characterize the transcriptional regulation of stm <dig> by ppgpp and ssrb, we constructed a ΔrelaΔspotΔssrb triple mutant strain , and examined the affect of the transcriptional activity on stm3169::lacz fusion gene. while the transcriptional activity of stm3169::lacz fusion in the triple mutant strain was significantly reduced at the same level of ΔrelaΔspot double mutant strain, it could be restored by introduction of plasmid pssrb expressing ssrb-flag but not prela expressing his6-tagged rela . these results indicate that ppgpp is controlled the expression of stm <dig> through ssrb.

stm <dig> is homologous to dctp in rhodobacter capsulatus with a 31% identity and a 73% similarity. dctp, along with dctq and dctm, constitutes a tripartite atp-independent periplasmic transporter  system involved in succinate utilization, and dctp plays a role as an extracytoplasmic solute receptor in this transporter  <cit> . stm <dig> and stm <dig>  which are located immediately downstream from stm <dig>  have a 66% and an 80% similarity with dctq and dctm, respectively. these suggest that the trap-t in s. typhimurium is composed of stm <dig>  stm <dig>  and stm <dig> genes. in addition, two hypothetical operons, yiaomn and stm4052- <dig>  are annotated as trap-t in the s. typhimurium strain lt <dig>  <cit> . recently, it has been reported that the trap-t  in haemophilus influenzae is essential for lps sialylation and virulence  <cit> . further research is necessary to determine the role of these transporters in s. typhimurium virulence.

CONCLUSIONS
we constructed an agarose 2-de reference map of amino-acid starved s. typhimurium and identified a novel virulence-associated factor, stm <dig>  regulated by ppgpp by applying the map to comparative proteomics. stm <dig> is also regulated by an spi- <dig> two-component regulator, ssrb. recently, it has been reported that the lack of ppgpp synthesis in salmonella strains attenuates virulence and induces immune responses in mice  <cit> . thus, further analysis of proteins regulated by ppgpp may lead to the development of new vaccines.
