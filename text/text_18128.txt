BACKGROUND
the application of high-throughput sequencing has accelerated the characterization of environmental prokaryotes, with two major approaches widely used for different purposes. one approach involves tag  sequencing on phylogenetic marker genes  to understand community composition  <cit> , whereas the other uses whole-genome shotgun sequencing on environmental dna  to study metabolic potentials embedded in the environment  <cit> .

with the use of 16s rrna tag sequencing, the immense diversity of marine prokaryotic communities has been reported in various oceanic habitats, including sea surfaces  <cit> , bathypelagic zones  <cit> , and deep-sea hydrothermal vents  <cit> . several environmental parameters have been associated with marine prokaryotic diversity, such as substrate availability  <cit> , day length  <cit> , and water mass  <cit> . prokaryotic communities also exhibited compositional variation at various pelagic depths  <cit> , confirming the importance of depth in determining their distribution in the ocean.

a metagenomic study using whole-genome shotgun sequencing describes marine prokaryotic diversity from a metabolic perspective. analyses on metagenomes collected in the water column of the hawaii ocean time-series  station aloha revealed vertical zonation of protein functions  <cit> , whereas the deep-sea community had greater metabolic versatility and genomic plasticity than sea-surface counterparts  <cit> . based on genomes of  <dig> prokaryotic isolates from global ocean surfaces, there was a preference for slow growth in most cosmopolitan lineages of dominant abundance, whereas minor species apparently switched between slow and fast growth under ambient conditions  <cit> . functional adaptation of marine prokaryotes was manifested by the enrichment of specific metabolic pathways in various environments, such as genes for microbial heterotrophy in the deep mediterranean sea  <cit> , transposases in a hydrothermal chimney biofilm  <cit> , and transporters in a hadopelagic metagenome  <cit> .

the south china sea , the largest marginal sea in the tropics, is a preferred area for oceanographic research, owing to its complicated basin topography and current system  <cit> . the diversity of several prokaryotic groups in the scs has been reported. for example, flow cytometric analysis on the scs surface demonstrated the dominance of prochlorococcus in summer, whereas synechococcus and picoeukaryotes had peak abundance in winter  <cit> . based on nifh gene sequences, the diversity of the diazotroph community in the scs was relatively simple, predominated by trichodesmium and alphaproteobacteria  <cit> . compositional differences and functional gene diversity of the scs crenarchaeota community indicated niche partitioning in the water column  <cit> . based on 16s rrna tag sequencing, bacterial communities in the scs contained abundant sar <dig> bacteria at depths and had depth-dependent compositions  <cit> . the scs is a marginal sea connected to the pacific ocean at the surface, and has a deep basin with persistently strong stratification  <cit> , both of which make this oceanic area an isolated niche under mesopelagic depths. similar to the observed depth-dependent community composition, we further hypothesized that the metabolic potentials of local prokaryotes are also zoned within the pelagic scs. at the same time, we were also intrigued by many questions about metabolic potentials of local prokaryotic communities. what metabolic functions characterize different pelagic zones in the scs? what metabolic potentials in the scs are different from and similar to other oceans at different depths?

to verify this hypothesis and address these questions, a 2-year metagenomics survey was conducted at the south east asia time-series study  station . in october  <dig>  a pilot study was performed to identify the pelagic depths harboring differential bacterial communities. in october  <dig>  detailed sampling was conducted at those depths to probe the bacterial and archaeal communities  and metabolic potentials . thereafter, comparisons among the scs and other oceans were conducted to identify contrasting features delineating pelagic zones around the globe.

RESULTS
to determine appropriate sampling depths for our metagenomics survey, a pilot study was conducted at the seats station on october 20– <dig>   <dig>  with detailed experimental procedures appended in the supplementary methods . in brief, seawater samples were intensively collected at  <dig> depths throughout the water column . denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of bacterial 16s rrna genes identified similar community patterns at epipelagic depths , whereas there was a distinct community at  <dig> m . therefore, we selected  <dig> m ,  <dig> and  <dig> m , and  <dig> m  for the  <dig> metagenomics survey.

hydrography and microbial abundance in the south china sea
major sampling was conducted during cruise  <dig> of the r/v ocean research i of the oceanography institute of national taiwan university on october 21– <dig>   <dig>  four seawater samples  were collected from the seats station, and stratified profiles of water temperature, salinity, and density were measured simultaneously with a sea-bird conductivity-temperature-depth profiler . the temperature-salinity diagram indicated that there were three water masses in the sampled water column . several nutrient parameters were also measured  <cit>  . detailed comparisons of scs hydrography with other oceans are reported in the supplementary results . microbial abundance in the scs was highest at  <dig> m and lowest at  <dig> m .

prokaryotic 16s rrna gene diversity in the south china sea
in this study, tag sequencing  <cit>  of the 16s rrna hypervariable v <dig> region  was used to characterize bacterial and archaeal community diversity and composition. after length-filtration and primer removal, four bacterial and four archaeal amplicon samples were submitted to the silva-ngs pipeline  <cit>  to define the operational taxonomic units  at 98% similarity level with taxonomic labels from silva. diversity indices and rarefaction curves were estimated per sample using mothur  <cit>  based on otus generated by silva-ngs.

among four sampling depths, bacterial and archaeal communities both had their greatest diversity  at  <dig> m and lowest at  <dig> m . according to rarefaction curves, only the bacterial sample at  <dig> m approached an asymptote , suggesting that additional sequencing efforts in the shallower zones would detect greater diversity. in the scs, the bacterial community was always more diverse than archaea within the same pelagic zone, consistent with previous studies that used a clone library  <cit>  or 16s rrna tag sequencing  <cit> . good’s coverage estimates sampling completeness by calculating the probability that a randomly selected read from a sample had been sequenced. at 98% similarity level, good’s coverage values for bacterial and archaeal samples ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  when estimated using all reads .table  <dig>

bacterial community structure in the south china sea
bacterial and archaeal community structures were inferred from the taxonomy information of all otus identified by the silva-ngs pipeline via the blastn search of otu representatives against the silva ssu ref database.

with regard to the bacterial community, the proteobacteria were predominant in the scs water column, accounting for  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of total 16s rrna v <dig> amplicon sequences in the 10-, 100-, 1000-, and 3000-m samples, respectively. cyanobacteria were relatively abundant  at  <dig> m. at the class level, alpha- and gammaproteobacteria were the two most abundant lineages, albeit with opposite distributions with depth . betaproteobacteria  contributed  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the 10- and 100-m bacterial communities, respectively, whereas gamma- and deltaproteobacteria became more abundant at ≥ <dig> m . cyanobacteria not only accounted for a substantial abundance at  <dig> m, but interestingly accounted for  <dig> % of the 3000-m bacterial community .figure  <dig>

archaeal community structure in the south china sea
euryarchaeota and thaumarchaeota were the two major phyla of the archaeal community in the scs . within the euryarchaeota phylum, marine groups  ii and iii were inversely distributed through the water column. mg ii euryarchaeota gradually decreased in abundance  at depths from  <dig> to  <dig> m, whereas mg iii euryarchaeota increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> % . in addition, mg i thaumarchaeota, which were previously affiliated with the crenarchaeota phylum  <cit> , were mostly comprised of nitrosopumilales. they were most abundant at depths of ≥ <dig> m, with relatively stable abundances  in comparison to the euryarchaeota . the decreasing abundance of mg ii euryarchaeota with increasing depth and detection of mg i thaumarchaeota below  <dig> m correspond to previous observations using card-fish  <cit> .

depth specificity of prokaryotes in the south china sea
depth specificity of otus occurred at various pelagic zones in the scs. a subset of cyanobacterial otus appeared at  <dig> and  <dig> m, whereas a group of otus affiliated with oceanospirillales only existed below  <dig> m depth . by aligning otus according to taxonomy across all depths, the oceanospirillales order consisted of different otus according to depth , and eurybathic taxa such as sar <dig> and deferribacteres also comprised different depth-specific otus . furthermore, mg ii and mg iii euryarchaeota had more prominent depth specificity at shallow and deep depths, respectively . although mg i thaumarchaeota harbored similar abundances at all depths below  <dig> m , there was also depth-specific variation in otus within the phylum .figure  <dig>

comparison of 16s rrna gene diversity with other oceans
eleven bacterial 16s rrna v <dig> tag sequencing libraries were collected from three water columns at the azores , mediterranean sea , and hot  to compare 16s rrna gene diversity with the scs. the three water columns were chosen because they contained samples covering epipelagic, mesopelagic, and bathypelagic depths. all samples were analyzed using the silva-ngs pipeline and mothur, to match the analysis of all scs datasets.

in the four water columns, bacterial community diversity  always peaked at intermediate depths, with the lowest value at the surface . regarding taxonomic composition, alphaproteobacteria and cyanobacteria were more abundant in all of the ocean surfaces examined, whereas gammaproteobacteria were more common in the deeper oceans. these results corresponded to the clustering results showing that bacterial communities in shallow waters separated from their deep-water counterparts . similar clustering patterns were apparent in the non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis of bacterial communities at both the class and genus levels .table  <dig>

metagenomics of the south china sea
metagenomes from four depths in the scs were sequenced using a whole-genome shotgun approach. a total of  <dig>  metagenomic reads were generated using roche  <dig> pyrosequencing and assembled into  <dig>  contigs by gs de novo assembler . a total of  <dig>  open reading frames  were predicted from contigs, of which the average coverage ranged from  <dig> x to  <dig> x . approximately 61% of the orfs matched protein homologs in the eggnog database, using blastp with an e-value ≤10− <dig>  on average, 27% of the orfs passed the second criterion of a bit-score ≥ <dig> .table  <dig>

the metagenomic gc content  at different depths was variable, reflecting distinct genomic compositions at each of the four depths. metagenomes in the shallow scs  had 10% lower %gc values than at depth . the 3000-m metagenome had two peaks  in the %gc plot , indicating co-existence of low- and high-gc microbial groups. the 10- and 100-m metagenomes were estimated to have average genome sizes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp, respectively, roughly two-fold smaller than the other two deep scs samples .figure  <dig> 
gc content distribution of seats metagenomes. curves are kernel density estimates of the %gc values of contigs in the metagenome.



based on reciprocal tblastx analysis, each metagenome had, on average,  <dig> % of contigs that matched other samples. homologous contigs were more frequently detected at neighboring depths; in this regard,  <dig> % of contigs at  <dig> m matched the 1000-m sample, whereas only  <dig> % matched the 10-m contigs .

functional analyses of metagenomes in the south china sea
putative orfs were searched against the eggnog database to annotate their function, based on the clusters of orthologous groups  system. only cog assignments with enough significance  and alignment quality  were involved in the functional enrichment analysis using the r package shotgunfunctionalizer  <cit> . the cog gene family frequency was quantified using the number of reads mapped to orfs. every metagenome was compared with all the others  to identify significantly enriched cogs  at each depth.

in the 10-m metagenome, genes for bacteriochlorophyll synthesis , antioxidant regulation , photolyase , dna synthesis , and amino acid metabolism  were enriched . osmoregulation functions were relatively abundant at  <dig> m, especially for osmolyte transportation  and catabolism . other enriched functions included cogs for nitrogen assimilation  and energy production . the 1000-m metagenome featured abundant cogs for signal transduction , chemotaxis , and iron acquisition , whereas plasmid and phage replication initiation , nutrient transport , and uncharacterized conserved bacterial proteins  were enriched in the 3000-m metagenome .figure  <dig> 
enriched functional genes at  10-,  100-,  1000-, and  3000-m pelagic zones at the seats station. the original counts of each functional gene are labeled on top of each bar.



as oceanographic parameters had similar vertical profiles with depth  and were highly correlated , depth was selected as the parameter for poisson regression analysis of cog abundances. overall, cogs enriched in the surface scs had decreasing abundance with increasing depth , and the opposite trend was found in cogs that were abundantly detected at  <dig> and  <dig> m . details are appended in the supplementary results .

comparison of functional genes in other oceanic metagenomes
a comparison between scs metagenomes and metagenomes from other oceans was performed to examine metabolic genes regionally enriched in the surface  and deep  scs. we also applied the two-group comparison  for this analysis. gene family frequency in each metagenome was quantified using the number of reads mapped to orfs, which were functionally annotated by blastp using the same criteria as the scs metagenomes . significantly enriched cog gene families were identified by the benjamini-hochberg adjusted p-value ≤ <dig>   <cit> .

in addition to the cobalamin synthesis protein  and arginine decarboxylase , the scs surface also contained more methionine synthase , glucose-6-p dehydrogenase , and membrane gtpase  than other ocean surfaces . interestingly, urease  was also more abundant at the scs surface. for the deep scs, there were substantial cogs of exonuclease v , plasmid replication initiation , phage replication protein , and nutrient transport , all of which had informative annotations in the top- <dig> list .figure  <dig> 
enriched functional genes at  seats  <dig> m versus other ocean surfaces and  seats  <dig> m versus other deep oceans. the original counts of each functional gene are labeled at the top of each bar.



last, global sea-surface and deep-sea metagenomes  were compared to identify metabolic genes discerning the epi- and bathypelagic zones. the cogs for ammonium assimilation , carbon assimilation , and carotene production  prevailed in the global ocean surfaces . in global deep-sea metagenomes, transcriptional regulators , signal transduction proteins , and transposases  were detected in abundance .

discussion
the 16s rrna tag sequencing  <cit>  and shotgun metagenome analysis  <cit>  are two important methods that have greatly enhanced microbial community surveys. in this study, we used both approaches to profile prokaryotic communities and metagenomes in the scs water column at depths of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> m. comparative analyses of the scs and other oceans described zonation of microbial community and metabolic potentials in global epi- and bathypelagic zones.

although betaproteobacteria is a typical freshwater lineage  <cit> , it is frequently present in oceans  <cit> . betaproteobacteria in the scs mainly appeared at  <dig> and  <dig> m, where it accounted for  <dig>  and  <dig> % of local communities, respectively . phylogenetic analysis revealed that they were closely related to the genera cupriavidus, ralstonia, and herbaspirillum . betaproteobacteria in the scs was more abundant than the reported  <dig> % in the arctic ocean  <cit> . the abundance of betaproteobacteria was attributed to the geographical location of our sampling site. the seats station is adjacent to the pearl river, the second largest river by volume in china, and offshore freshwater inflow could be one of the sources of betaproteobacteria in the scs. furthermore, the scs has frequent typhoon events during the summer and autumn, which increases the betaproteobacteria abundance in coastal waters  <cit> ; therefore, the abundant betaproteobacteria in the scs surface could be a regional community feature associated with climatic activity. jing et al.  <cit>  reported a minor amount of betaproteobacteria  in the scs surface during august  <dig>  which was lower than our observation in october  <dig> at the same site. two potential reasons could contribute to this variation. firstly, jing et al. used a different region to probe the community   <cit> , and secondly, a typhoon  and a tropical storm  crossed the northern scs between jing et al’s sampling and the present study.

following the scenario that coastal inflow might introduce bacteria into the open scs, the low abundance of flavobacteriia  drew our attention. the primer coverage analysis revealed that the known diversity of bacteroidetes  and flavobacteriia  were barely covered by the primer we used in this study , suggesting a potential underestimation of the diversity of bacteroidetes  at the study site.

cyanobacteria harvest light energy through photosynthesis and thrive at the ocean surface. therefore, detection of cyanobacteria in the scs  <dig> m  was unexpected , although it is not a new finding for aphotic areas such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents  <cit> , at  <dig> m in the north pacific subtropical gyre  <cit> , and at  <dig> and  <dig> m in the north pacific ocean  <cit> . a bacterial community survey detected cyanobacteria at  <dig> m in the scs  <cit> , and another report indicated that there was prochlorococcus in the aphotic western pacific ocean  <cit> . they ascribed the presence of prochlorococcus in aphotic waters to physical processes that cause vertical water mixing. however, the higher abundance of cyanobacteria at  <dig> m relative to intermediate depths  suggested their potential presence as a long-term lineage in scs bottom waters. if so, questions about deep-sea cyanobacteria  warrant further investigation. the heterotrophic ability of prochlorococcus has been reported, such as the uptake and use of amino acids  <cit> , dimethylsulfoniopropionate  <cit> , phosphite  <cit> , and glucose  <cit> . however, the low availability of dissolved organic matter in the deep sea makes it more likely for prochlorococcus to use endogenous carbon sources  for survival in the dark, just like other cyanobacteria  <cit> . moreover, these phototrophs are also likely dormant or even dead in the deep sea.

it was noteworthy that euryarchaeota dominated the archaeal community in the scs water column, with more mg ii euryarchaeota at  <dig> m  and mg iii euryarchaeota in the  <dig> m water . mg ii euryarchaeota were generally abundant at the ocean surface  <cit> ; their decreasing abundance with depth has been reported at the hot station aloha  <cit> , seats station  <cit> , and arctic ocean  <cit> . furthermore, mg iii euryarchaeota were first identified in the deep northeast pacific  <cit> , and subsequently in several other aphotic depths in the mediterranean sea  <cit> , antarctic polar front  <cit> , and arctic ocean  <cit> , suggesting that mg iii euryarchaeota are denizens of the deep sea. although mg i crenarchaeota  and mg ii euryarchaeota are the two most renowned marine archaea by abundance  <cit> , mg iii euryarchaeota would be a noteworthy archaeal lineage dominant in the deep, consistent with our results  and those of the deep arctic ocean  <cit> .

water masses at different pelagic depths varied in several physicochemical properties , and thus were presumed to act as dispersal barriers for marine prokaryotes  <cit> . because the scs is geomorphologically a deep basin, strong stratification and constant ventilation among stratified waters  <cit>  create particular niches for different prokaryotes, which may account for detection of depth-specific otus in the scs water column .

the environment is one of the determinants linked to genomic nucleotide composition  <cit> . the scs surface metagenomes had lower genomic %gc values than their deep-sea counterparts , indicating intrinsic differences among collected microbial communities. low genomic %gc values were prevalent in ocean surface prokaryotes  <cit>  and are ascribed to abiotic factors such as nitrogen limitation  <cit> . as the sea surface environment experiences oxidative stress and solar radiation that can cause dna mutations, both the inherent at-biased mutations  <cit>  and inadequate repair systems  <cit>  are potential factors resulting in low %gc values at ocean surfaces. for the deep scs, the 3000-m metagenome had two peaks, at  <dig> and  <dig> %gc , suggesting parallel abundances of two populations with differing %gc values.

at  <dig> m in the scs, cobalamin synthesis protein  was prominently enriched in comparison to both deeper scs waters and other ocean surfaces . cobalamin  is heterogeneously distributed  in the ocean  <cit>  and is essential for the synthesis of several enzymes in prokaryotic metabolic systems; e.g., methionine synthase in amino acid synthesis and methylmalonyl-coa mutase in the citric acid cycle  <cit> . as the scs 10-m metagenome also contained more methionine synthase  than other surface-sea metagenomes , the scs surface was likely to have a greater demand for cobalamin for amino acid synthesis. this was further supported by enrichment of gene suites involved in cobalamin  and isoleucine synthesis  pathways compared with other sea surfaces in the pathway-centric enrichment analysis. urease , which hydrolyzes urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia, was uniquely overabundant at the scs surface , suggesting a higher urea supply rate in the scs than other oceans. in part, this may be associated with anthropogenic inputs from the pearl river and hainan island  <cit> . prokaryotes are known to acquire urea as an alternative nitrogen source when ammonia is limited  <cit> , and additional measurements of ammonia concentrations may help to associate the enrichment of urease with scs hydrological conditions.

similar to deep-sea whale falls  <cit>  and 4000-m hot  <cit>  metagenomes, the scs 1000-m community was enriched with cogs for signal transduction . bacteria carrying more signal transduction proteins supposedly have larger genomes  <cit> ; therefore, the average genome sizes of the scs metagenomes were estimated. the 1000-m sample possessed the largest genome size,  <dig>  mbp , which was comparable to the genome of the 3000-m sample  and approximately twice as large as the 10- and 100-m metagenomes. this demonstrated that prokaryotes in the meso- and bathypelagic scs had larger genomes than those at epipelagic depths. interestingly, chemotaxis proteins were enriched in the aphotic scs  <dig> m, but only in the photic zone of hot  <cit> . therefore, we inferred that the distribution of chemotaxis proteins was driven by factors other than pelagic depth. signal transduction and chemotaxis proteins were reportedly more common in copiotrophic bacterial genomes  <cit> , suggesting a higher abundance of copiotrophs at  <dig> m, corresponding to the depth at which most nutrients reached plateau concentrations .

in comparison to both shallower scs depths and other deep oceans, the bathypelagic scs were especially enriched with metagenomes with plasmid replication initiation functions , emphasizing the importance of plasmid genes  in the 3000-m assemblage. exonuclease v  participates in various dna-processing pathways . its enrichment may be associated with dna digestion for protecting hosts from foreign dna, corresponding to the enrichment of transposase in global deep-sea metagenomes  and the supposedly higher frequency of horizontal gene transfer in the deep ocean  <cit> .

as the scs metagenomes underwent multiple displacement amplification  to obtain enough dna for pyrosequencing, those differentially enriched metabolisms that are less correlated with local environmental characteristics might have resulted from the bias introduced by mda, which was not used in metagenomic studies of other oceans. with respect to the bias of mda, kim and bae  <cit>  demonstrated that single-stranded dna viruses were preferentially amplified by mda. this bias in viral dna amplification could be reduced by using different methods, such as converting viral dna into double-stranded dna prior to amplification  <cit> . to date, most discussion about the bias of mda has focused on the bacterial community composition  <cit>  and viral metagenomes  <cit> , but the bias towards bacterial metabolic potentials is not fully understood.

CONCLUSIONS
this work presented herein contributes to the knowledge of the microbe-stratified interior of the scs. the use of 16s rrna tag sequencing demonstrated the prevalence of alpha- and gammaproteobacteria throughout the water column, and the existence of deep-sea cyanobacteria. furthermore, mg ii and mg iii euryarchaeota were two major archaea in the surface and bottom scs, respectively. in addition to the contrasting %gc and average genome size of shallow  and deep  scs metagenomes, based on embedded metabolism, there was vertical zonation at various pelagic depths. comparing global sea-surface and deep-sea metagenomes revealed functional preferences delineating epi- and bathypelagic communities. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply community genomics to the scs, investigating prokaryotic diversity and metabolic potentials among the stratified pelagic zones. the scs is located between the two most important heat “engines” of the global climate  and is irregularly subjected to physical forces from the southeast asian monsoon, typhoons, strong internal waves, and el niño-southern oscillation, making the seats station a unique, ocean time-series study site sensitive to climate changes. therefore, microbial community variation associated with climatic disturbances  and current intrusion  is of particular interest for future work in the scs, which will help to elucidate the ecological interactions between marine microbes and environmental variations.
