BACKGROUND
integrated genetic and physical maps are extremely valuable resources for map-based gene cloning, comparative genome analysis, and sequencing and assembly of large and complex genomes. screening bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries is an indispensable step for integration of genetic and physical maps, by which bac clones and contigs can be placed and ordered on a genetic map. the use of an appropriate bac pooling strategy  <cit>  maximizes work efficiency. two different approaches, hybridization-based and pcr-based, are available for bac library screening. the hybridization-based approach is based on multi-dimensional pools of molecular markers or probes hybridizing with high-density bac library screening membranes to identify the bac clones associated with specific nucleotide sequences or genes. overgo probes have been used for large scale physical mapping of plant and animal genomes, such as those of soybean  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and human  <cit> . because a single overgo probe may hybridize with clones in multiple contigs and several probes may hybridize to the same clone, the overgo probes often fail to unequivocally associate a contig with a locus on a genetic map. this may arise from gene duplication, repeat sequences in a bac clone or probe, or false positives.

a pcr-based six dimensional  bac clone pooling strategy has been successfully used by other groups for bac library screening in sorghum  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> . this pooling strategy includes a conventional three-dimensional  stack, called plate pool, face pool and side pool, and an additional three types of pools, called row pool, column pool and diagonal pool. a positive clone in a bac plate is located by only three types of pools; the other three types of pools are used only for verification. hence, this strategy not only uniquely defines individual clones and efficiently eliminates false positives but also reduces the tedious task of individual clone verification. however, the six dimensions result in a large number of pools for pcr screening, and limit the size of bac libraries to be screened. for example, a total of  <dig> pools were generated for  <dig>   <dig> bac clones  in sorghum  <cit> ,  <dig> pools for  <dig>  bac clones  in maize  <cit> , and  <dig> pools for  <dig>  bac clones  in soybean  <cit> . because the number of pools that must be screened is a function of the bac library size, the workload for screening larger bac libraries, such as those of the grasses in the tribe triticeae that includes wheat, barley and rye, will be unacceptably high. for example, in the physical mapping project  of aegilops tauschii, the diploid ancestor of the wheat  d genome, five bac libraries comprise a total of  <dig>  clones , which equal to ~ <dig> × ae. tauschii genome equivalents. if the same pooling strategy as had been used in maize were used,  <dig> pools  would be needed. this would be extremely laborious in dna pool preparation and pcr screening. in order to reduce pool number and relieve pcr workload, luo et al.   <cit>  evaluated a high-throughput five-dimensional  clone pooling strategy based on both illumina's goldengate assay and pcr screening of ae. tauschii bac clones. the major points of this strategy include:  conventional 3-d grid design  with the plate pools further grouped into two-dimensional  pools, referred to as super pools in luo et al.  <dig>  <cit> . because the pooling procedure involves five different dna pool sets, this design was called a 5-d clone pooling strategy  <cit> .  super pools screened by illumina's goldengate assay and row and column pools screened by pcr.  positive plate pools at 3-d intersections further verified by pcr to find positive plate pools among the putative positives. this strategy reduces pool number and adopts the highly parallel goldengate assay for clone screening, and makes high-throughput clone screening possible for large genomes. with this strategy, 95% of illumina's goldengate est-based oligonucleotide markers unequivocally assigned bac clones to loci on the genetic map  <cit> .

the 5-d clone pooling strategy still requires a considerable effort to identify positive plates among the putative positive plates in super pool screening by pcr assays. in addition, clone row pools and column pools also need to be screened by pcr. here we describe a new implementation of this strategy, in which clone row and column pools are further divided into sub-pools with 1~2× genome coverage to minimize the number of positive pools among the putative positive pools. the rationale for limiting the number of genome equivalents screened at a single time is that the number of false positives increases exponentially with the number of genome equivalents screened. if a 1× genome equivalent is screened, then there is an average of one plate row and plate column intersection and hence no false positive plate. if a 2× genome equivalent is screened, then there are on average four plate row and plate column intersections with four putative positive plates, of which two are false positive. if a 3× genome equivalent is screened, then there are on average nine plate row and plate column intersections with nine putative positive plates, of which six are false positive.

in the implementation of the screening strategy pursued here, all pools are screened with the illumina goldengate assays. the assay data is then combined with bac contig data and overlapping clones in bac contigs are employed as additional information to discriminate between pool intersections that harbour positive clones and intersections that are false positive. a computational algorithm was designed for this implementation of the 5-d pooling strategy, which was integrated into a newly developed software tool, fpcbrowser, for analyzing pooling data.

RESULTS
clone deconvolution algorithm
clone deconvolution identifies clone that have a desired marker by analyzing information about pool intersections in a multi-dimensional bac pooling design. the 5-d pooling strategy employing row-pools , column-pools , plate pools , column super-pools , and row super-pools  is graphically detailed in luo et al.  <dig>  <cit> . the 5-d deconvolution algorithm is based on information generated by a combination of pool screening with the illumina goldengate assay and clone overlaps in the contig map . the illumina goldengate assay detects a positive plate rsp, plate csp, clone rp and clone cp for each molecular marker . a positive plate pool is at the intersection of plate rsp and plate csp in the super pool 2-d design matrix . candidates for positive clones are at intersections of positive clone rps, and positive clone cps, and positive plate pools. in each set of positive clone candidates only a few clones are truly positive  clones; the rest are false positive clones at multiple intersections generated when more than a single positive rp and cp are obtained by illumina goldengate screening. since multiple genome equivalents are always screened, more than one tp clone is expected. because tp clones share the same marker, they should share also a portion of their fingerprint profiles and hence be neighbours in a contig . an exhaustive search across all contigs for a group of clones that are among the candidate clones and are neighbouring clones in a contig can pinpoint the tp clones among the candidate clones. if the marker is present only once in a genome , only one set of clones should be tp clones. a discrimination score can be assigned to each set of clones and the set of clones with the maximum score is inferred as the most likely tp clones associated with that marker. because the search is exhaustive and no sole deterministic solution is available for an unbalanced multiple dimensional pooling design, this is an exhaustive search or brute force algorithm for an optimization problem  <cit> .

of  <dig>  snp markers mapped to the ae. tauschii d genome physical map, the contig location of  <dig> markers had been verified by pcr screening in the previous study  <cit> . this data set was used to test the new clone deconvolution algorithm. three different versions of phase i ae. tauschii contig assemblies were generated with different assembly stringencies and end merges, assembly  <dig>  assembly  <dig> , and assembly  <dig>  and these assemblies were used in clone deconvolution for comparison of the "perfectness" of the assemblies . assembly  <dig> was initiated at 1×10- <dig> followed by dqing and contig end-to-end merging, and generated  <dig>  contigs. the dqing is a process of gradually eliminating questionable clones  by the dqer module in the fpc software  <cit> . the number of contigs was further reduced to  <dig>  in assembly  <dig>  by relaxing the conditions of contig end-to-end merges. assembly  <dig> is an initial assembly at a higher stringency of 1×10- <dig> with  <dig>  contigs.

*  assembly 1: the assembly started at 1×10- <dig>  followed by step-wise dqing down to 1×10- <dig>  the clones resolved by the dqing process were put back into singletons. the singleton-to-contig end merging was performed at 1×10- <dig>  the contig end-to-end merging  at 1×10- <dig> and at 1×10- <dig> was performed last.  assembly  <dig> : assembly  <dig> was subjected to a contig merge. the contig end-to-end merging  was performed starting at 1×10- <dig> and stepping down to the level of 1×10- <dig>   assembly 2: the clones were assembled into contigs at 1×10- <dig> 

to evaluate the accuracy of the clone deconvolution algorithm, two performance metrics, recall and precision, were used. the recall is defined as the number of tp markers deconvoluted by the algorithm divided by the total number of markers analyzed, and the precision is defined as the number of tp markers divided by the total number of markers with solutions deconvoluted by the algorithm. the tp markers are those for which tp clones were assigned by the algorithm. different versions of contig maps resulted in significantly different deconvolution results. in assembly  <dig> ,  <dig>  out of  <dig> markers were successfully associated with tp clones  with a precision of 91% . in assembly  <dig>  only 15% of markers were correctly assigned to tp clones. therefore, a relatively "perfect" contig map is a prerequisite for clone deconvolution. in our example, assembly  <dig>  approximated the "perfect" assembly the best.

in the analysis using the assembly  <dig>  contig map,  <dig> markers were found without solutions, and  <dig> markers were assigned to false positive  clones. the seven failed deconvolutions had two primary reasons:  low genome coverage in cp or rp , and  f+ and false negative  screening results in cp pools and rp pools . f- pool hits are mostly caused by low genome coverage of pools. f+ pool hits are likely related to either data clustering by the illumina goldengate assay or failures of the illumina goldengate assay. only one out of  <dig> failed markers was due to plate super pool deficiency . obviously, reasonable increase of pool coverage will considerably reduce f- hits and increase the success rate and precision of clone deconvolution.

software implementation
the clone deconvolution algorithm developed for the 5-d clone pooling strategy has been integrated into a newly developed tool, fpcbrowser, a java-written, platform-dependant and gui-based software tool . fpcbrowser was initially designed as a portable physical map viewer to comprehensively view fpc contig maps and related information such as clones, fingerprints, and markers in multiple platforms. a java-based relational database, hsqldb  <cit> , was adopted in fpcbrowser to store all source data of a fpc contig map and the fingerprints of bac clones in a physical mapping project, which are also required in clone deconvolution, as well as the analysis results of clone deconvolution. a program module of the clone deconvolution was appended to fpcbrowser for pooling data analysis .

for clone deconvolution, fpcbrowser needs a relatively "perfect" contig map as input , a 2-d super pool matrix design file and a formatted pool hit file based on the goldengate genotyping assay   <cit> . the clone deconvolution module generates as output a summary file, an anchored positive marker file used for convenient conversion to an ace file to merge markers into a fpc contig map, and a deconvolution result file for each marker for further manipulation. a java tool for ace file conversion directly from the result file is also available in the fpcbrowser package.

performance of this module depends on several major factors, such as the genome coverage of pools, the number of contigs and contig lengths. when the pooling data of  <dig> snp markers and assembly  <dig>  of the contig map were used , only  <dig>  minutes were needed by a desktop computer  to execute the operation. the executable binary version of fpcbrowser is freely available at http://avena.pw.usda.gov/wheatd/fpcbrowser.shtml

discussion
the new implementation of the 5-d clone pooling strategy employs the goldengate genotyping assay to screen bac clones in  <dig> types of pools, rsp, csp, rp and cp , which replace pcr screening and verification for positive plates in rsp and csp and for positive clones in rp and cp in the previous implementation  <cit> . the rp and cp pools are further divided into sub-pools with 1~2× genome coverage to reduce the number of false positive clones in clone deconvolution. although the total number of screened pools increases, this does not significantly raise the cost for the high-throughput goldengate genotyping assay. the fifth dimension is the information about overlapping bac clones in a contig map which is used to detect and verify truly positive clones among a pool of candidate clones at the intersections of the preceding four dimensions. a clone deconvolution algorithm and corresponding software fpcbrowser have been developed for this purpose. this new implementation provides a high-throughput and low cost approach to bac library screening and deconvolution of clone pools, and tremendously reduces work load otherwise required for pcr screening and verification of a large number of pools  <cit> . in a test with  <dig> snp markers previously associated with ae. tauschii contigs via the goldengate assay and manual pcr  <cit> , this implementation yielded a 87% success rate with 91% precision. some markers resulted in f+ or had no solutions compared to the previous implementation  <cit> . improving contig assembly and increasing genome coverage of pools can reduce no-solution and f+ markers.

a "perfect" contig map and adequate pool coverage are two critical components for the clone deconvolution algorithm. although contig assembly never results in an absolutely perfect contig map because of assembly errors, substandard fingerprinting, chimeric clones, and other reasons, relatively "perfect" contigs can be obtained by an appropriate contig assembly strategy. as long as truly positive clones associated with the marker are overlapping each other in a contig, the contig map for that marker is "perfect", irrespective of the status of the rest of the contig. in addition, if the markers used have been mapped on a genetic map, mapping data can be used for the verification of pool deconvolution. collocation of markers in a single contig and on a genetic map can validate deconvolution. if a contig is anchored with only a single marker, additional pcr verification of deconvolution may be prudent.

the test data showed that low genome coverage of pools is another reason for f+ anchoring of clones or the inability to place a bac clone on the physical map  resulting in low precision contig anchoring. although the average coverage of rp and cp was  <dig> × in our test data set of  <dig> snp markers , the actual genome coverage for some of the markers was still low . if a better contig map and higher actual genome coverage were used, a deconvolution success rate higher than the 87% achieved here can be expected.

note: only  <dig> column pools in the hindiii-pecbac <dig> library was used in illumina goldengate genotyping.

CONCLUSIONS
a new implementation of 5-d bac clone pooling strategy employing both the goldengate assay to screen bac pools and the use of previously assembled bac contigs is suggested. the implementation is shown to be a high-throughput, low cost, rapid, and feasible approach to screening bac libraries and anchoring of bac clones and contigs on genetic maps. the software fpcbrowser with the integrated clone deconvolution algorithm has been developed and is downloadable at http://avena.pw.usda.gov/wheatd/fpcbrowser.shtml
