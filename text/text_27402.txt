BACKGROUND
wheat  is the third most important cereal crop worldwide in terms of production and the most important in terms of calorie consumption, with overall production increasing year after year  <cit> . however, in developing countries such as afghanistan, wheat production has declined steadily, an alarming trend in countries already struggling to meet basic food demands. in order to achieve sustainable production goals, most national programs have begun either exploiting existing natural diversity to identify strains suitable for specific regions or climates or have simply used elite varieties developed by private or international agricultural research centres. regardless of the approach taken, identifying important alleles and other genetic information present in existing gene pools will be necessary to achieve optimal crop yields. moreover, the establishment of self-driven germplasm activities is more sustainable, as this approach utilises native landraces, which are well suited to local environments.

landraces have been identified as distinct, locally-adapted species with a high capacity to tolerate biotic and abiotic stresses, resulting in higher sustainable yields, as well as intermediate yields under low input agricultural conditions  <cit> . populations such as these arose as a result of both natural and artificial selection, adapting not only to crop centres of origin, but also to new environments following transplantation.

afghanistan is the third largest centre of origin for domesticated crops worldwide  <cit> , having played an important role in the domestication of wheat, barley , chickpeas , peas , and rye . however, frequent armed conflicts and other factors have led this country to lose all known germplasm collections developed to date. fortunately, one long-running scientific expedition led by dr. hitoshi kihara and others between  <dig> and  <dig> established an extensive afghan wheat landraces collection, which is now housed in japan. while other afghan wheat collections do exist, the collection of landraces found in the kihara institute for biological research, japan is thought to be unique in terms of the number of sites visited, the diversity of their environmental conditions, and the overall number of landraces collected  <cit> . moreover, in contrast to other landraces, those of this collection are thought to be homozygous, since they were allowed to propagate by self-pollination over the course of several generations of genotypic studies. the genetic diversity contained within may therefore hold significant potential for both afghanistan and beyond; however, significant work is needed to characterize these samples fully.

the recent development of molecular markers and high throughput systems has revealed a wealth of genotypic information for a wide variety of crops and plants  <cit> . among these, single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most common type of sequence variation in the genome  <cit> , making them well suited for genomics approaches requiring a high number of markers, such as association mapping  <cit>  and genomic selection  <cit> . high-throughput snp genotyping platforms have long been available for diploid crops such as maize  <cit>  and barley  <cit> , and snp arrays were developed recently for wheat  <cit> . snp analysis has been used successfully to characterize rice landraces  <cit> ; however, similar work in other landrace collections, such as wheat, has been minimal  <cit> . here we examined a large, yet poorly characterized wheat landrace collection from afghanistan to determine the genetic diversity, population structure, and other characteristics associated with genetic polymorphisms.

RESULTS
the kihara afghan wheat landrace  collection and its importance
although the importance of landraces in terms of both conservation and utilisation remain controversial  <cit> , much of this uncertainty stems from the lack of reliable data regarding the use and implementation of these resources  <cit> . over the past few decades, significant efforts have been invested in the collection, preservation, and use of landraces worldwide. however, these efforts have failed to address the role of afghan wheat landraces, a significant absence given the historical significance of this region in the domestication of wheat. while little remains of the local afghan stocks, private collections, such as the one initiated by dr. kihara, have preserved much of the original diversity, accounting for ~ <dig> unique afghan landraces  <cit> . furthermore, the kihara collection was maintained and preserved in both pure and homozygous states, increasing the novelty of these materials relative to other landraces. in addition, this germplasm contains representative landraces from all of the wheat-growing areas of afghanistan, across eight agro-climatic zones, allowing for the most comprehensive study of the afghan wheat gene pool to date   <cit> . recently mitrofanova et al.  <cit>  examined the genetic diversity of afghan bread wheat landraces by compiling data available through all of the major gene banks worldwide. however, the scope of this analysis included only a small subset of available lines, with characterizations limited to just a handful of ssr markers.figure  <dig>

in addition to genetic variations, phenotypic descriptions of this germplasm were also investigated, resulting in a total of  <dig> distinct botanical varieties. a previous study by buerkert et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> botanical varieties in afghan wheat landraces, although the number of unique landraces included in that study was significantly smaller than in the collection described here. variations in spike morphology were also explored, revealing  <dig> different spike types, ranging from var. compactum  velican to var. speltoides  velican . such an abundance of both genetic and phenotypic diversity evident in these materials makes this collection an essential resource for rebuilding the afghan wheat industry and for improving the diversity of the afghan wheat germplasm. outside of afghanistan, this germplasm represents an important resource for understanding wheat genetics and for developing new strains that may be better adapted to local climates.figure  <dig> 
classification of spikes in afghan wheat landraces. the germplasm number and botanical variety for each landrace are mentioned in the attached label. although a total of  <dig> botanical varieties were identified, only those showing clear variation are shown here.



analysis of snp markers
following gbs analysis, data were filtered to remove snps exhibiting a minor allele frequency ≤10%, resulting in a total of  <dig> snp markers. of these markers,  <dig> were identified as transition markers, while  <dig> represented transversion snps. chromosomal alignments were successful for  <dig> markers, with snps distributed across all  <dig> chromosomes . the highest number of markers was found on chromosome 2a and the lowest in chromosome 4d; a majority of markers were located in close proximity to the centromeres. as expected, more markers were identified in the a and b genomes than in the d genome, consistent with a previous study  <cit> , indicating a need for targeted marker development for the d genome. preliminary efforts to address this deficiency include the development of a dart marker array based on  <dig> aegilops tauschii coss accessions  <cit> , although the resulting marker coverage remains lower than desired.figure  <dig>

individual genetic distances and kinship relationships
the pairwise roger genetic distance between each of the  <dig> landraces ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an overall mean distance of  <dig> . while such a high degree of divergence is uncommon for a national collection of self-pollinated landraces, this result is not without precedent; semagn et al.  <cit>  reported a similar mean distance of ~ <dig>  for a diverse set of cimmyt maize inbred lines. of the  <dig>  pairwise distances,  <dig>   fell between  <dig>  and  <dig>  , with only  <dig>  exhibiting values < <dig> . comparisons between selected controls resulted in a total of  <dig>  pairwise distances, of which  <dig>   fell between  <dig>  and  <dig> , and only  <dig>  exhibited distances < <dig>  . taken together, these results are indicative of a very low degree of genetic redundancy within this collection.figure  <dig>

in contrast to the high overall genetic distances between landraces, the relative kinship coefficients between pairs of samples ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> , with an average value of  <dig> , which is a bit higher than that seen in the cimmyt maize study   <cit> . the majority of the pairwise kinships  fell below  <dig>  , while  <dig>   of the pairwise kinship coefficients between controls fell below  <dig>  . only  <dig>   of the pairwise kinship coefficients between landraces and  <dig>  of the pairwise kinship coefficients between landraces and controls were > <dig> , suggesting that the vast majority of landraces described in this study may be contributing new alleles to the afghan gene pool, even though ~70% of them were collected from only three provinces .

dendrogram
high-throughput snp arrays were used to evaluate  <dig> kawlr samples and  <dig> controls originating from landraces of neighbouring countries, along with improved afghan varieties, and one durum wheat genotype. phylogenetic analysis revealed the complex nature of the diversity present in these landraces, which could be divided into  <dig> major clades . among these  <dig> clades, clade i accounted for ~30% of all landraces. this clade consisted of landraces collected from badakhshan, baghlan, bamyan, and takhar provinces, along with six landraces from ghor, four from kabul, two from samangan, and one from faryab. the provinces of badakhshan, baghlan, bamyan, and takhar are all located in the northeast region of afghanistan, where their wheat landraces are expected to cluster together. more surprising was the inclusion of an ishkashim landrace in this clade, considering its predecessor originated in tajikistan. on the other hand, clade ii was limited to landraces collected from badakhshan province, with the exception of one landrace from parwan. landraces from the north central provinces of balkh, samangan, and faryab clustered primarily within clade viii. clades vi and ix were comprised of landraces from ghor, herat, wardak, badghis, and bamyan provinces, while clade x contained landraces collected from ghor, herat, and wardak.figure  <dig>

clade vii contained the iranian landraces nbrp <dig> and nbrp <dig>  along with most of the herat and kandahar landraces, and an additional  <dig> landraces from ghor. geographically speaking, ghor province is located in the centre of afghanistan and is surrounded by the provinces of herat, wardak, badghis, kandahar, and bamyan; this central location likely accounts for the overlap among these regions. clades iii, iv, and xi included a mixture of afghan landraces belonging to different provinces, along with control nbrp <dig>  which clustered in clade iv.

the remaining controls were grouped mainly into three clades: v, xii and xiv, of which clade v was comprised exclusively of controls. the rest of the hexaploid wheat controls, accounting for  <dig> genotypes, clustered within clades xii and xiv alongside  <dig> afghan landraces , consisting of  <dig> from badakhshan, five from kabul, two from takhar, one from kunduz, one from ghor, one from herat, and three from unknown sources. the significant divergence between the afghan landraces and controls highlights the novelty of this collection and its potential value for the development of new wheat varieties.

as expected, the durum wheat genotype was clustered as an out-group in this analysis, although four afghan landraces also clustered independently of other landraces in the highly differentiated clade xiii. table  <dig> summarizes the distances and the relative kinship relationships within this clade and in relation to the entire germplasm. the durum genotype had the lowest kinship and the greatest distance relative to the germplasm mean; its highest kinship and shortest distance was with landrace  <dig>  of the afghan landraces, three  exhibited very high kinship and short genetic distances among each other; medium kinship relationships and distances were seen with landrace  <dig>  while low kinship and long distances were seen in comparison to the durum genotype and germplasm means. taken together, these three genotypes appear unique in relation to other clades, and may therefore harbour distinctive genes that could be exploited for breeding purposes. in contrast, landrace  <dig> appears to be a variety of durum wheat , a distinction most likely the result of misclassification or human error.table  <dig>

population structure
to further clarify our diversity analysis and to better estimate population subdivisions, a population structure analysis was performed using only kawlr samples. samples were analysed using structure software  <cit> , revealing  <dig> distinct sub-populations  within our germplasm. in order to differentiate these sub-populations, samples were further categorised based on collection site, taxonomy, and morphology . the landraces of badakhshan province alone were grouped into five different sub-populations, while the sub-population with the highest number of accessions  combined landraces collected from neighbouring herat and ghor provinces. when comparing sub-populations based upon botanical varieties, nine sub-populations could be identified as having unique botanical varieties. for instance, the var. milturum  velican from badakhshan province was grouped exclusively with landraces collected from high elevations. other examples include var. ferrugineum  velican and var. erythrospermum  velican, the major varieties found in our collection, which were often grouped together. overall these results highlight the considerable diversity present in our germplasm, along with the ability of structure analysis to better connect genomic diversity with its corresponding phenotypic outcomes, such as geographic distribution and botanical varieties.figure  <dig> 
population structures of afghan wheat landraces according to collection site and botanical variety. population structure analysis resulted in  <dig> sub-populations . details of the botanical variety composition are indicated for each group. mixed type structure is defined as landraces lacking a specific botanical variety and those in which the province of origin is not known.



the badakhshan samples contained the greatest degree of diversity in our study, which can be used to adapt existing wheat strains to particular agro-climatic zones. afghanistan is divided into eight agro-climatic zones  <cit> , each of which is unique in terms of optimum crop yields. for wheat cultivation, afghanistan is classified as mega environment  <dig>  suitable for facultative wheat production with irrigation  <cit> . however, an fao  report, combined with other project studies, showed that nearly 70% of afghan land used for wheat production is within areas receiving sub-optimal rainfall, consistent with the need for selective breeding to adapt wheat varieties to local conditions.

outside of botanical varieties, population structures were also affected strongly by the collection year. for instance, genotypes collected before  <dig> were classified either primarily or completely within sub-populations 2– <dig>  8– <dig>  and  <dig>  whereas samples collected in  <dig> or later grouped primarily in sub-populations  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  moreover, landraces collected before  <dig> were distributed across a higher number of sub-populations, with an average major sub-population contribution of  <dig> %, compared with  <dig> % for landraces collected after  <dig>  this analysis indicates a shift towards lower overall genetic diversity over time, with less deviation from a landrace’s major sub-population. this observation is consistent with our original assumptions, in that increasing wheat cultivation during this time period led to a reduction in overall genetic variation due to the greater availability and deployment of improved varieties, along with substantial changes in living conditions. similar trends have continued in the years since this collection was completed, highlighting the need for alternative approaches to wheat cultivation in this region  <cit> .

geographical sub-population analyses
next, landrace population structures were re-estimated using only  <dig> landraces collected from badakhshan, ghor, herat, takhar, kabul, badghis, kandahar, bamyan, and samangan provinces, resulting in  <dig> distinct sub-populations. the strongest divisions were seen among landraces isolated from badakhshan and takhar provinces, as these two regions grouped independently of the remaining regions when divided into two groups . increasing the number of clusters resulted in division of the badakhshan samples into seven sub-populations, of which five were unique to this province.figure  <dig> 
population structures of  <dig> afghan wheat landraces collected from nine provinces ; only provinces with ≥ <dig> landraces were used in this analysis.




nei genetic distances were also calculated using only the landraces described above. the most closely related sub-populations were from herat and ghor, followed by badakhshan and takhar, with genetic distances of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the largest distances were seen between takhar landraces and those collected from kandahar and badghis . the average nei distance was the lowest  between all kabul genotypes and those of other sub-populations, whereas takhar and kandahar genotypes were the most divergent . this result was somewhat surprising, given that kabul genotypes showed the highest mean heterozygosity value , while the kandahar genotypes exhibited the least amount .table  <dig>

the nei genetic distance analyses were consistent with those of our pca analysis, indicating a strong reproducibility across analytical methods . the first and the second principle coordinates account for over two-thirds of the total genetic variation among the nine sub-populations; the first coordinate accounted for  <dig> % of the variability and the second for an additional  <dig> %. interestingly, the provinces of badghis, herat, and ghor were clustered in both coordinates, while the provinces of kabul, samangan, and bamyan were clustered close together on one coordinate but far apart on the second. of the remaining provinces, badakhshan and takhar provinces clustered together tightly, while kandahar failed to cluster with any of the other groups. these results are consistent with a previous study that examined the phylogeny and population structure of these regions.figure  <dig> 
principal component analysis of afghan wheat landraces. the first coordinate explained  <dig> % of the variability, while the second one accounted for an additional  <dig> %.



finally, an analysis of molecular variance  was performed under different conditions . the resulting f-statistic indicated a significant proportion of variance among all cases , with a high degree of variance among varieties within a province  but a low proportion of variance nationwide . since landraces collected from badakhshan and takhar provinces clustered together so tightly when analysed using only two groups , we performed a second round of amova in which we considered these landraces as either one population or as one region consisting of two distinct populations, with all remaining samples clustered similarly . when considering the entire germplasm as only two populations, the variety between them was 16%. however, when considered as two populations containing a number of sub-populations, 11% of the total variation could be attributed to the variance between the regions, while only 4% was attributed to the variation among populations . overall amova showed that the snp markers were able to assess the genetic variation among afghan wheat landraces successfully, revealing clear relationships with regard to their genetic origins.table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study demonstrating the untapped genetic potential of dr. kihara’s afghan wheat landrace collection. this study was performed using the maximum number of markers available, revealing a substantial degree of genetic diversity among samples. this work also disproved a previous study that evaluated this germplasm and suggested a low degree of overall diversity  <cit> . our use of population structure and diversity analyses in combination with collection site data clearly separated the germplasm into distinct groups, which were broadly related to the various agro-ecological zones associated with each geographical region. use of this phenotypic and environmental data may provide insight into some of the important genetic differences evident among subtypes, indicating possible functional implications for many genetic variations. preliminary studies have confirmed this hypothesis, identifying potential genotypes associated with biotic and abiotic stress situations. taken together, the genetic and phenotypic data presented here may help to improve the existing wheat gene pool in afghanistan, allowing for greater adaptability to local environments, leading to better and more consistent crop yields.
