BACKGROUND
a close temporal and spatial association exists between the development of hematopoietic and endothelial stem cells during embryogenesis. this is first observed in extra-embryonic mesodermal tissues such as the yolk sac. within the developing yolk sac primitive erythrocytes are surrounded by a layer of angioblasts  <cit> . the close temporal and spatial association of these two lineages led to the hypothesis that they arise from a common precursor of mesodermal origin known as the hemangioblast  <cit> . further support for the existence of a common precursor comes from gene targeting disruption studies, which demonstrate that some genes are essential for the development of both lineages. for example, the scl/tal- <dig> gene, previously described for its essential role during hematopoiesis, is also expressed in the developing vasculature and is required for vascular remodeling during embryogenesis  <cit> . one of the earliest cell surface markers that defines this bipotential cell is the vegf receptor- <dig> . targeted disruption of vegf-r <dig> similarly leads to defects in vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis  <cit> .

one powerful tool to study the earliest steps in the differentiation of hematopoietic and endothelial cells is the use of embryonic stem cells in culture  <cit> . most studies suggest that the molecular events leading to the development of the hematopoietic and endothelial lineages in embryoid bodies  derived from es cells in culture are very similar to those observed during embryonic development  <cit> . during es cell differentiation, blast colony-forming cells  can be isolated from ebs that exhibit endothelial and hematopoietic potential  <cit> . bl-cfcs expressing vegf-r <dig> can be identified within ebs about  <dig>  days.

several transcription factors that are required for definitive hematopoiesis have been identified . the transcription factor runx <dig> , a member of the core binding factor  family of transcription factors is required for the establishment of definitive, but not primitive hematopoiesis  <cit> . the transcription factor gata- <dig> is required for differentiation of the erythroid lineage  <cit> . finally, the homeobox transcription factor hoxb <dig> was shown to promote the potential of hematopoietic stem cells derived from es cells that contribute to definitive hematopoiesis, promoting the development of self-renewing, long term, hematopoietic progenitors  <cit> .

considerably less is known about the transcription factors and the molecular mechanisms that regulate endothelial differentiation. the purpose of this study was to use an es cell differentiation system to identify genes that are preferentially expressed at early and later stages of endothelial differentiation. we identified four populations of cells; cells expressing vegf-r <dig> , cd <dig> expressing cells , cells expressing cd <dig> , and cells expressing cd <dig> . as negative control we have also isolated vegf-r <dig> negative , cd <dig> negative , negative cd <dig> , and negative cd <dig> . in addition, we isolated cd <dig> positive and cd <dig> negative cells from mouse embryos at embryonic day  <dig> . microarray analysis of the rna isolated from each of these populations of cells allowed for the identification of genes expressed in these subsets of cells and suggest their potential role during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells along the endothelial lineage.

methods
es cell culture
cce embryonic stem cells  were maintained on irradiated primary embryonic fibroblasts  in knockout dmem  supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum , penicillin/streptomycin 1% , l-glutamine  <dig> mm , non-essential amino acids  <dig>  mm, nucleosides  <dig>  mm, 2-mercaptoethanol  <dig>  mm , monothioglycerol   <dig> mm , and esgro leukemia inhibitory factor   <dig> units/ml . es cells were grown in lif-containing media for  <dig> hours. to generate ebs, es cells were separated from the feeder cells, re-plated at a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per  <dig> cm dish , and grown in media without lif to promote differentiation.

flow cytometry and cell sorting
to prepare single-cell suspensions ebs were washed with pbs and disrupted by pipetting after  <dig> min treatment with cell dissociation solution at 37°c . whole embryo cells were dissected from the decidual tissue of e <dig>  pregnant 129/sv mice and washed in pbs . dissected embryos were incubated for 60– <dig> minutes at 37°c in  <dig> % collagenase/dispase  and 20% fetal bovine serum  and subsequently dissociated into a single-cell suspension. all cells were fixed in 3: <dig> ethanol:glacial acetic acid and washed extensively in pbs prior to immunofluorescent staining. cells were initially incubated with rat-monoclonal anti-ve-cadherin antibody  at room temperature for  <dig> min, followed by labeling with anti-rat fluorescein-isothiocynate -conjugated antibody . subsequent double labeling with phycoerythrin -conjugated anti-vegf-r <dig> and -cd <dig> antibodies  was also performed at room temperature for  <dig> min. flow cytometry and cell sorting was completed on the fc <dig> flow cytometer at the beth israel deaconess medical center flow cytometry core facility using cxp analysis program.

rna extraction and quantitative rt-pcr
total rna from facs-sorted cells was isolated using an rneasy kit . real-time pcr was performed containing sybr green i , forward and reverse primers ,  <dig>  mm dntps,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>  1u taq polymerase , and 1u platinum taq antibody  in 1xpcr buffer under the following conditions: denaturation at 95°c ;  <dig> cycles at 94°c , at 60°c , at 72°c . gapdh was used as an internal reference in each reaction. amplification was followed by melting curve analysis using the program run at the step acquisition mode to verify the presence of a single amplification product in dna. accumulation of pcr products was monitored and determined using the opticon monitor . the threshold cycle  was determined using the opticon analysis software. oligonucleotide primers for quantitative rt-pcr for each gene were:

microarray analysis
for transcriptional profiling, the mouse genome  <dig>  <dig>  affymetrix genechip, containing more than  <dig>  transcripts was used. rna for the microarray experiments was obtained in duplicates from two separately conducted experiments using the murine es cells. microarray analysis was conducted via the genomics center at the beth israel deaconess medical center, according to previously described protocols for total rna extraction and purification, cdna synthesis, in vitro transcription reaction for production of biotin-labeled crna, hybridization of crna with mouse genome  <dig>  <dig>  affymetrix gene chips, and scanning of image output files  <cit> . the quality of the scanned array images was determined on the basis of background values, percent present calls, scaling factors, and 3'-5' ratio of β-actin and gapdh using the bioconductor r packages  <cit> .

scanned array images were analyzed by dchip, as it is more robust than mas <dig>  and rma in signal calculation. the raw probe level data was normalized using smoothing-spline invariant set method. the signal value for each transcript was summarized using perfect-match-only  based signal modeling algorithm described in dchip. the pmo based modeling algorithm yields less number of false positives as compared to the pmo-mm model . in this way, the signal value corresponds to the absolute level of expression of a transcript  <cit> . these normalized and modeled signal values for each transcript were used for further high-level bioinformatics analysis. during the calculation of model based expression signal values, array and probe outliers are interrogated and images spike are treated as signal outliers. the outlier detection was carried out using dchip outlier detection algorithm. a chip is considered as an outlier if the probe, single or array outlier percentage exceeds a default threshold of 5%.

when comparing two groups of samples to identify genes enriched in a given phenotype, if 90% lower confidence bound  of the fold change  between the two groups was above  <dig> , the corresponding gene was considered to be differentially expressed  <cit> . lcb is a stringent estimate of fc and has been shown to be the better ranking statistic  <cit> . it has been suggested that a criterion of selecting genes that have a lcb above  <dig>  most likely corresponds to genes with an "actual" fold change of at least  <dig> in gene expression  <cit> .

the final list of positive, phenotype-specific, differentially expressed genes was generated by removing all the genes that were also differentially expressed in the negative control population during the same transition. for example, the initial list of differentially expressed genes for vegf-r2+/cd41+ at day  <dig>  as compared to vegf-r2+ at day  <dig>  was corrected by removing the genes that are also differentially expressed in the negative control cells . further corrections in the identified differentially expressed genes were made by comparing changes in the expression in negative populations  versus positive populations  over time.

the raw miame compliant microarray data is available online in the geo repository at ncbi  <cit> .

western blot analysis
whole cell lysates  of cells were boiled in laemmli buffer and resolved on 10% sds-page acrylamide gel. proteins were transferred on hybond-pvdf membranes and immunoblotted using the ecl western blotting detection reagents . polyclonal antibodies against ve-cadherin, cd <dig>  and alpha actin were obtained from pharmingen.

immunohistochemistry and microscopy of embryoid bodies and the yolk sac
ebs from different time points  were washed with pbs and embedded in oct freezing compound  after fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for  <dig> hour at 4°c and cryoprotection in 20%  sucrose overnight. frozen sections  were mounted onto gelatin-coated glass slides, air-dried overnight, permeabilized for  <dig> minutes with  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  and washed two times with pbs. slides were then processed for immunofluorescence microscopy using fitc-conjugated cd <dig>  pe-conjugated ve-cadherin, and fitc-vwf rat antibodies . 129/sv mice were bred to generate day e <dig>  embryos. the yolk sac was dissected from the embryo proper and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and frozen in oct. immunohistochemistry was performed using  <dig> μm sections. fluorescent images were obtained using a nikon eclispse e <dig> microscope  equipped with a  <dig> x/ <dig>  numeric aperture objective lens as well as a zeiss axiocam digital camera . images were analyzed using openlab imaging software version  <dig> . <dig> .

RESULTS
the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial differentiation from pluripotent stem cells remain incompletely understood. we have used a murine es cell differentiation system to identify the genes involved in the process of endothelial differentiation. cells were grown in the presence of lif, and allowed to differentiate into cystic ebs in the absence of lif. vegf-r <dig> positive cells were first detected in es cells by flow cytometry  <dig>  days after the initiation of differentiation . approximately 11% of the es cells expressed vegf-r <dig> at this time point. one day later  20–25% of the es cells express vegf-r <dig>  we identified a small subset  of vegf-r <dig> expressing cells  that express the endothelial-cell specific cell surface antigen cd <dig>  at  <dig>  days. one of the earliest cell surface markers of the hematopoietic lineage has recently been identified as cd <dig> , which is first detected in differentiating es cells at  <dig>  days  <cit> . approximately 5% of cells express cd <dig> and vegf-r <dig> at this time point . at day  <dig> , cd <dig> and cd <dig> are still expressed on a subset of vegf-r <dig> positive cells . however, the individual expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> seems to diverge onto separate cell populations, with only a small percentage  of cd <dig> positive cells showing cd <dig> co-expression . also, by day  <dig> , the number of vegf-r <dig> expressing-cells is significantly decreased  .

ve-cadherin is expressed on the surface of endothelial cells, during vascular development and in the adult cells  <cit> . to verify the expression of these cell surface markers at the protein level, western blot analysis was performed at different time points during es cell differentiation. no expression of cd <dig> or cd <dig> was observed at  <dig>  days . however, at day  <dig>  there was a significant increase in the expression of both cd <dig> and cd <dig> 

because of the close temporal and spatial relationship between hematopoiesis and endothelial differentiation in the developing embryo, we were also interested in evaluating the spatial relationship between the expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> in the ebs. we observed the formation of small channels within the ebs lined by cd <dig> positive cells in  <dig>  day ebs . cd <dig> expressing cells  were observed in discrete sections of the ebs, and appeared to be located within the lumen of the channels formed by the cd <dig> positive cells . nuclear staining with dapi demonstrated that the areas where cd <dig> and cd <dig> are expressed represent distinct regions within the ebs . co-localization of cd <dig> and cd <dig> positive cells further validated the close proximity of cells expressing these two markers. to further validate the endothelial cell specific nature of the cd <dig> positive cells, the expression of the endothelial cell specific marker von willebrand's factor  was also evaluated. the expression pattern of cd <dig> and vwf observed in the ebs is nearly identical . to extend these studies we also evaluated the expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> in the developing yolk sac. we observed a close association between the expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> in the yolk sac, with the lumen of blood vessels in the yolk sac lined by cd <dig> positive cells, and cd <dig> positive cells within the lumen . these studies confirm the close temporal and spatial association between the differentiation of endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells from pluripotent stem cells in the developing embryo, and support the ability of murine es cells to recapitulate the steps associated with hematopoietic and endothelial differentiation, using an in vitro differentiation model.

to begin to define the molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation of hematopoietic and endothelial cells from a bipotent hemangioblast, we performed microarray experiments using rna derived from different subsets of es cells at different time points during the process of differentiation. the four positive populations isolated , included vegf-r <dig> positive population at day  <dig>  ), cd <dig> positive population at day  <dig>  ), cd <dig> positive population at day  <dig>  ), and cd <dig> positive population at day  <dig>  ). additionally, as negative control cells, we have also isolated four negative populations, vegf-r <dig> negative population at day  <dig>  , cd <dig> negative population at day  <dig>  , cd <dig> negative population at day  <dig>  , and cd <dig> negative population at day  <dig>  . microarray analysis was performed using affymetrix mouse genome  <dig>  <dig>  chips at the beth israel deaconess medical center microarray facility. dot plots in figure  <dig> demonstrate the efficiency of the facs sorting and purity of each of the isolated cell populations.

early vegf-r <dig> positive es cells express several mesodermal markers
one of the earliest markers of the bipotent hemangioblast is vegf-r <dig>  these cells are of mesodermal origin, and have previously been shown to express mesodermal markers such as brachyury  <cit> . we examined the expression of genes in the vegf-r <dig> positive population of cells at day  <dig> , compared to those at later stages of es cell differentiation such as vegfr2+/cd41+ and vegfr2+/cd144+ . in addition to brachyury, we identified several other genes, including the homeobox genes lim <dig>  mixl <dig>  even skipped, and goosecoid, all of which are highly expressed in the embryonic mesoderm . these results support the idea that the vegf-r <dig> positive cells, isolated at day  <dig>  are of mesodermal origin and undergo differentiation in this model system.

* the values shown in the columns are corrected fold changes . the corrected fc for a transcript is obtained by subtracting the fc for the particular transcript in the negative control populations from fc for the positive populations .

markers of hematopoiesis in the cd <dig> expressing es cells at day  <dig> 
we identified a small population of vegf-r <dig> positive cells expressing the early hematopoietic marker cd <dig> and cells not expressing cd <dig>  at day  <dig> . microarray analysis was performed on rna derived from these cells. vegfr2+/cd41+ compared to the vegf-r <dig> positive cells at day  <dig>  have  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts. out of these  <dig> transcripts, all the transcripts that were differentially expressed in the negative control cells in the same transition  were filtered out. the final list of vegfr2+/cd41+ specific differentially expressed transcripts consists of genes associated with hematopoiesis . it has also been suggested that in vitro es cell differentiation systems closely recapitulates the events associated with hematopoietic development in the yolk sac, including primitive erythropoiesis, megakaryocyte, and mast cell differentiation  <cit> . the first of these to occur is primitive erythropoiesis. we identified transcription factors upstream of erythropoiesis, including aml- <dig>  gata- <dig>  and erythroid krueppel-like factor , and genes predominantly associated with the erythroid lineage . however, ikaros and helios, two zinc finger transcription factors known to regulate lymphopoiesis, were also enriched in this cd41-positive population  <cit> . helios expression is restricted to cells of t cell origin. these results suggest that either these transcription factors exhibit additional functions at earlier stages of hematopoiesis or that initiation of other hematopoietic lineages, in addition to the erythroid lineage, occurs during es cell differentiation.

markers of endothelial differentiation expressed in cd <dig> positive cells
to evaluate whether genes of the endothelial lineage are expressed in early cd <dig>  positive cells during es cell differentiation, we compared microarray data of rna isolated from cd <dig> positive cells at day  <dig>  to vegf-r <dig> positive cells at day  <dig> . to identify genes that are uniformly upregulated in the cd <dig> positive cells, we also performed microarray analysis of rna samples from the negative controls . the cd <dig> positive cells at day  <dig>  have  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts that are further corrected by removing the transcripts differentially expressed in the negative control cells in the same transition  or . this final list has enrichment of selected endothelial-specific genes, including tie <dig> and the endothelin receptor b . in addition, several transcription factors were identified as being enriched at this stage, including krueppel-like factor  <dig> , the sry-box   <dig>  and the forkhead box p <dig> transcription factor.

to examine the specific gene expression profile at later stages of endothelial differentiation, we performed microarray analysis of cd <dig> positive and cd <dig> negative cells isolated from es cells  <dig>  days after differentiation. the cd <dig> positive cells at day  <dig>  compared to vegf-r <dig> positive cells obtained at day  <dig>  showed differential expression of  <dig> transcripts. transcripts that were differentially expressed in the negative control cells  were removed from the list. additional analysis was performed to eliminate remaining false positive genes . the final list has several endothelial-specific genes including pecam- <dig>  claudin  <dig>  and roundabout homolog  <dig>  .

to identify genes that are selectively enriched in endothelial cells during embryonic vascular development, we also isolated cd <dig> positive cells from murine embryos at day  <dig> . cd <dig> positive cells were sorted and separated from cd <dig> negative cells, and microarray analysis was performed. because the number of cd <dig> positive cells isolated from the embryos was much smaller, an amplification step was performed prior to the microarray analysis. the results of the microarray analysis also demonstrate an enrichment of several endothelial-specific genes including icam- <dig>  ve-cadherin, pecam- <dig>  and endothelial nitric oxide synthase  . the expression of several transcription factors was also determined to be enriched in this population of cells, including sox  <dig>  the ets factor erg and elk <dig>  vezf <dig>  foxo <dig>  and c/ebp delta. table  <dig> shows a condensed list of genes whose expression is increased in all cd <dig> positive cells, including the ones isolated at different stages of eb differentiation , and day  <dig>  embryos. the genes upregulated in the cd <dig> positive cells were not detected in hematopoietic cells  .

a color map of the relative expression levels obtained via microarray analysis, including the mesodermal, hematopoietic, early and late endothelial markers was also generated . signal values were normalized within the  interval as shown by the color scale at the bottom of the image where red indicates high expression and green indicates low expression.

the expression of a representative number of the genes identified to be enriched in the cd <dig> and cd <dig> expressing stem cells  were also evaluated by quantitative rt-pcr. the results of these studies confirm the expression patterns observed in each of the populations observed by microarray analysis . for example, a subset of the genes identified to be enriched in the cd <dig> positive cells  compared to vegf-r <dig> positive cells  at day  <dig>   were evaluated by quantitative rt-pcr. these genes, including ikaros, aml- <dig>  hemoglobin y, and cd <dig>  and are expressed 4– <dig> fold higher in the cd <dig> positive cells . similarly a number of genes found to be upregulated in cd <dig> positive cells at day  <dig>  and  <dig>  during es cell differentiation compared to vegf-r <dig> positive cells  , were similarly validated by quantitative rt-pcr . many of these genes, including the endothelin receptor, flt- <dig>  and tie <dig>  are known to be endothelial cell specific, or involved in regulating endothelial function. the expression of a similar set of genes was also enriched in cd <dig> positive versus cd <dig> negative cells in the mouse embryo at day e <dig>  , a subset of which, including tie <dig>  tie <dig>  ephrin a <dig>  klf <dig>  and mef2c, were validated by quantitative rt-pcr .

to further define the genes that are upregulated at the angioblast stage , and later stages of endothelial differentiation in the ebs , and in cd <dig> positive cells of the embryo , we performed a comparative analysis of these genes . we identified  <dig> genes  that are enriched in all three populations,  <dig> genes that are enriched in cd <dig> positive cells of the eb at early and later stages , and  <dig> genes  that are enriched in cd <dig> positive cells in later stages of the eb  and in cd <dig> positive cells of the embryo at day e <dig> . some of the genes identified in the overlapping sections of the venn diagram are listed in table  <dig> and  <dig>  a complete list of the up and down-regulated genes are provided in an on-line supplement  <cit> .

in addition to identifying genes that are enriched at various stages of differentiation, we were also interested in determining whether the genes identified have previously been shown to be linked to each other, or to other genes with regard to specific pathways. in the past few years a number of bioinformatic programs that are designed to evaluate potential links between the genes identified and potential pathways have been developed. we used the program pathwayassist  to evaluate the potential of underlying existing pathways at various stages of endothelial and hematopoietic development. in this approach a natural language processing module, medscan, is used to describe events of regulation, interaction and modification between proteins, cell processes and small molecules and the results are generated in the forms of biological pathways, gene regulation networks and protein interaction maps  <cit> . because considerably more is known regarding the genes involved in hematopoiesis, we first performed analysis of the genes enriched in the cd <dig> positive cells. the initial analysis was performed using transcription factors identified in the cd <dig> positive cells at day  <dig>  in the differentiating ebs compared to the vegf-r <dig> positive cells at day  <dig> . when the transcription factors alone are entered into this pathway analysis, the specific factors are linked in multiple ways. for example, klf <dig> and gata <dig>  which are known to be involved in erythropoiesis cluster together  with links to references for pathways). similarly, ikaros, aiolos, and helios, zinc finger transcription factors, are involved in lymphopoiesis are linked together. aml <dig>  is known to be upstream of all of the hematopoietic lineages. the pathway analysis was further expanded to include other proteins that are enriched in the cd <dig> positive population, including the hemoglobin genes, myeloperoxidase, c-kit, glycophorin, and other genes, in addition to the transcription factors identified. although, significantly more complex, the pathway analysis similarly supports the linkage of these transcription factors and pathways with specific target genes along various hematopoietic lineages . in addition to demonstrating the utility of this kind of pathway analysis for linking transcription factors with known gene targets and pathways that have previously been defined for hematopoiesis, these results also support the potential of this approach for identifying similar pathways during the process of endothelial differentiation.

we used a similar approach to try to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms involved at various stages of endothelial differentiation. we first evaluated the genes that are upregulated in cd <dig> positive cells at day  <dig>   compared to the hemangioblast. the transcription factors that are highly enriched in this population include klf <dig>  sox <dig> and the forkhead box p <dig> transcription factor. some of the potential networks and pathways were also evaluated using the pathwayassist program . similar analyses were conducted using the pathway assist program for genes identified to be enriched in cd <dig> positive cells  compared to day  <dig>  vegf-r <dig> positive es cells  and for cd <dig> positive cells isolated from mouse embryos at day  <dig> , which is comparable to day  <dig>  in the es cell differentiation system, compared to cd <dig> negative cells . we recognize that there are limitations of this type of analysis, and that the results of this analysis are only suggestive of potential pathways among the identified genes and transcription factors, and these analyses are therefore presented as supplemental data. future studies will be needed to verify specific aspects of the putative pathways identified.

discussion
overlap between hematopoietic and endothelial lineages
the close association of endothelial and hematopoietic lineage has now been demonstrated in several studies in a wide variety of species including xenopus, mice, and humans. our studies similarly support a very close temporal and spatial expression pattern of endothelial and hematopoietic progenitor cells in differentiating es cells. in human embryonic tissues, a population of endothelial-like cells with endothelial and hematopoietic potential expressing vegf-r <dig>  ve-cadherin, but not cd <dig>  was similarly identified  <cit> . we observed weak ve-cadherin expression on cd <dig> positive cells in both the yolk sac and differentiating ebs, but did not observe cd <dig> expression on endothelial cells lining the vascular channels in the eb or yolk sac, suggesting that as cd <dig> expression occurs the cells bud off of the developing vasculature.

differentiation of the hemangioblast toward the hematopoietic lineage
several transcription factors have been shown to be critical for different stages of hematopoietic cell differentiation. some of the critical transcription factors known to play a role early in hematopoietic cell differentiation include runx- <dig> , gata- <dig>  and members of the ikaros zinc finger transcription factor family. we also observed enrichment for these factors in early cd <dig> positive cells within differentiating ebs based on our microarray data. although the eb is generally considered as a model of primitive hematopoiesis, similar to what is observed in the yolk sac, the expression of many ikaros family members that are known to regulate several different hematopoietic lineages suggest a possible broader role for the cd <dig> positive cells identified in developing ebs in several hematopoietic lineages  <cit> .

differentiation of the hemangioblast toward the endothelial lineage
considerably less is known about the transcription factors and molecular mechanisms involved in regulating the differentiation of the hemangioblast along the endothelial lineage. in early  cd <dig> positive cells we observed that the increased expression of genes involved in regulating endothelial function such as tie <dig> and the endothelin receptor b, compared to genes expressed in vegf-r <dig> positive hemangioblast cells . we similarly identified a select number of transcription factors that were enriched in these cells, including klf <dig>  sox <dig>  and forkhead box  p <dig>  targeted disruption of foxp <dig>  which is expressed in the endocardium of the heart, is associated with abnormalities in cardiac development, similar to that observed with nfatc <dig>  <cit> . the krueppel-like factor  family members have also been shown to be involved in cellular differentiation. klf <dig> is expressed in the endothelium and is upregulated in response to fluid shear stress  <cit> .

because the early cd <dig> positive cells may not represent fully differentiated endothelial cells, microarray analysis was also performed on cd <dig> positive cells at a later stage of differentiation in the ebs  and isolated from the embryo . in addition to increased expression of several sox family members , the expression of several other transcription factors including the nuclear hormone receptor coup-tfii , mef2c, and klf <dig>  were observed. targeted disruption of the orphan nuclear receptor coup-tfii results in abnormal vascular and cardiac development  <cit> . one of the main downstream targets of coup-tfii is the angiogenic factor angiopoietin- <dig>  coup family members are involved in regulating the expression of bmp- <dig> during embryogenesis. bmp- <dig> promotes hematopoiesis and angiogenesis during vascular development  <cit> .

in cd <dig> expressing cells of the embryo  we observed significant overlap in the endothelial-specific genes and transcription factors upregulated in the cd <dig> positive cells derived from the embryo and differentiating ebs at day  <dig> . the transcription factors that were highly expressed and enriched in these cells included, sox  <dig>  sox  <dig>  mef2c, and klf <dig>  in addition several other transcription factors were also identified in cd <dig> positive cells of the embryo including the ets transcription factor family members erg and elk <dig>  gata <dig>  nfatc <dig>  sox <dig>  forkhead o1a, and c/ebp delta. the ets transcription factor elk <dig> is highly expressed at sites of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis during early mouse development  <cit> . furthermore, down-regulation of elk <dig> is associated with marked reductions in vegf expression. although elk <dig> principally functions as a repressor, ras activation leads to a phosphorylated form of elk <dig> that is highly active  <cit> . the ets factor erg is also enriched in endothelial cells and down regulation of erg in endothelial cells is associated with reductions in the expression of the endothelial-specific genes  <cit> . the gata factors have similarly been shown to regulate endothelial-specific genes. gata <dig> is involved in the regulation of pecam- <dig>  endothelin- <dig>  and icam- <dig>  <cit> . both the forkhead family members and nfatc <dig> function as transcriptional mediators of vegf in endothelial cells  <cit> . there are no previous reports suggesting a role for c/ebp delta in endothelial function or gene expression.

microarray chip analysis has been used in a number of studies for uncovering genes that are differentially expressed during hematopoietic and endothelial differentiation . in most of these studies, differentiating mouse or human es cells have been used as a model system for hematopoietic/endothelial differentiation. isolation of the vegf-r2+ cell population at an early stage of es cell differentiation was done in all of the mouse es cells studies as an already established population with hemangioblast properties  <cit> . human es cell hemangioblasts were more tightly defined by sorting out the vegfr-2+/cd34+ or vegfr-2+/cd31+ cells  <cit> . a number of mesodermal markers were identified in the vegfr-2+ cells at d <dig>  of differentiation including brachyuary  <cit> , msh homeo box homolog  <dig> , nodal, inhibin ba/bb  <cit> , hand <dig>  mesp <dig>  <cit> , and canonical wnt-signalling associated genes such as wnt3a and wnt8a  <cit> . these genes are involved in processes such as development, transcription, organ and system development, with genes such as sox <dig>  hoxb <dig>  and hoxb <dig> being specifically involved in hemangioblast differentiation  <cit> .

during the hemangioblast phase a number of early hematopoietic and endothelial markers are found to be co-expressed on the vegfr-2+ cells from day 3– <dig> of differentiation. genes found in these group include cd <dig>  tal/scl, runx1/aml <dig>  gata-2/ <dig>  lmo <dig>  notch <dig>  c-kit, cd <dig>  hoxb <dig> , and genes thought to be expressed on both, hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors including cd <dig>  ve-cadherin, cxcrf, flt- <dig> , kdr  <cit> , tgfα- <dig>  bmp <dig>  smad <dig>  wnt associated genes frzb, β-catenin, n-cadherin, msx <dig>  cyclin d <dig>  dkk <dig>  <cit> , lysocardiolipin acyltransferase   <cit>  and finally prdm <dig>  encoding a krueppel-like zinc finger protein  that functions in cell-fate decisions and malignant transformation  <cit> . most of these genes are downregulated as the divergence of the two cell lines takes place, however, a number of these markers maintain steady levels of expression throughout the course of differentiation. the onset of the definitive hematopoiesis is marked by the expression of cd <dig>  the genes involved in adult hematopoietic cell renewal   <cit> , cxcl <dig>  alcam  <cit> , mayeloblastosis oncogene  and hemoglobin genes  <cit> .

genes whose expression is enriched in more mature endothelial cells from day  <dig> and onwards include ve-cadherin, cxcr <dig>  <cit> , angiopoietin  <dig> , endothelin  <dig>   <cit> , icam- <dig>  neuropilin- <dig>  endoglin, transforming growth factor genes , wnt associated genes   <cit> , tie- <dig>  genes involved in angiogenic response to vegf such as pdgfbb, pdgfr- <dig>  shb  <cit> , asb <dig>   <cit> , caveolin, hey <dig>  fgfr- <dig>  and adhesion protein genes cadherin  <dig> and claudin  <dig>  <cit> . the findings from our microarray studies are in accord with the previously published studies. in addition, we have identified several additional genes such as ikaros and helios zinc-finger transcription factors, erg, claudin  <dig>  and sox <dig>  that segregate with the hematopoietic or endothelial cell populations . future studies will be needed to identify whether or not these genes play a significant role as determinants of endothelial or hematopoietic cell differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the results of our study support the use of embryonic stem cells to study the molecular events underlying hematopoiesis and endothelial differentiation. our results demonstrate the expression of distinct sets of genes in populations of embryonic stem cells expressing cd <dig> or cd <dig> that are consistent with genes associated with the hematopoietic or endothelial lineages. future studies should be directed at defining the role of selected transcription factors that are enriched in selected subsets of stem cells during the process of differentiation.
