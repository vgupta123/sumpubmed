BACKGROUND
visceral leishmaniasis , caused by leishmania infantum , is the most severe and fatal form of leishmaniasis. canine visceral leishmaniasis  is a serious public health problem in the americas, mediterranean region, africa, asia and europe  <cit> . dogs are very susceptible to infection and the most important domestic hosts  <cit> . euthanasia of seropositive dogs is recommended, but it did not effectively decrease the number of canine and human cases in brazil  <cit> . although chemotherapy may reduce or eliminate clinical signs in sick dogs, parasitological cure is not achieved  <cit> . in fact, a large proportion of infected dogs may become subclinically infected after chemotherapy, but some of them can still transmit the parasite to the sand fly vector. the use of topical insecticides and impregnated collars, as well as vaccines, is difficult to implement in a nationwide control program  <cit> . in the absence of other successful strategies, vaccine development against cvl has been quoted as one more promising control measure  <cit> . there is a clear consensus that cvl immunoprofilaxis may also have a positive impact on the human leishmaniasis transmission. however, although some available vaccines decrease infectiousness of the disease for dogs, they still allowed sand fly infection  <cit> .

the course of l. infantum infection in dogs depends on the host immune response, persistence and multiplication of the parasite. the innate and adaptive immunity components are engaged in a wide range of complex interactions. the initial steps in the innate immune compartment are important for a successful development of an acquired immune response  <cit> . cytokines play a decisive role during l. infantum infection  <cit> . cellular immune responses mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines  seemed to be associated with disease progression and severity  <cit> . however, there is a consensus that a pro-inflammatory cellular immunity plays a relevant role in the protective events during cvl  <cit> .

many efforts have been made by several groups in order to develop a vaccine against cvl  <cit> . in brazil, the vaccine leishmune®  was used for many years. nowadays, only one commercially available vaccine is in use  . leishmune® is composed of a glycoproteic complex, fucose–mannose ligand , and leish-tec consists of the a <dig> recombinant protein in saponin. field studies in brazil endemic areas demonstrated that leishmune® exhibited 76-80% efficacy  <cit> . leish-tec was also a potent immunobiological tool to prevent cvl, inducing high levels of igg <dig> and ifn-γ with concomitant decrease of il- <dig>  <cit> .

here, the one-year timeline kinetics of the pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines was evaluated in leishmune® vaccinated dogs. the cytokine profile produced by circulating leukocytes after short-term in vitro stimulation with lsag enabled the establishment of supportive immunological biomarkers after primovaccination.

dogs
in this work,  <dig> dogs of different breeds , with ages ranging from 8 months to 8 years, were selected in veterinary clinics located in belo horizonte, minas gerais, brazil and informed written consent was obtained from owners of all dogs. all dogs were evaluated during the course of the experiments by their respective veterinary doctors. only healthy dogs from the same area with negative serology  for cvl and regular anti-helmintic treatment were included in the study. leishmune® primovaccination was confirmed by immunization cards or in the clinical record files at the veterinary clinics. this is a cross-sectional study structured in three groups of  <dig> animals each, categorized according time after leishmune® primovaccination . all dogs had received subcutaneously the complete immunization protocol proposed by the leishmune® manufacturer . this consisted of three shots with 21 days interval. a group of ten seronegative non-vaccinated conscripts was included as control  to evaluate the pro and anti-inflammatory basal levels of cytokines.

leishmania infantum soluble antigen 
leishmania infantum promastigote forms  were grown in liver infusion tryptose medium , supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum at 24°c. slag production used stationary-phase parasites  as described  <cit> . final protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml. aliquots were stored at -70°c prior to short-term in vitro stimulation.

short-term whole blood culture in vitro
five ml of whole peripheral blood were collected from each dog in heparinized vacuum tubes. in vitro short-term cultures were performed as described by silva et al.  <cit>  and whole blood leukocyte counts were determined by automated hematology analyzer . aliquots of 500 μl of heparinized peripheral blood  were transferred to lithium heparin plasma separator tubes  and incubated for 48 hours at 37°c, 5% co <dig>  in the presence of 475 μl of rpmi  <dig> medium . one tube, referred as ag-stimulated culture , received 25 μl of l. infantum soluble antigen . a second tube, control culture , received 25 μl of rpmi. finally, as internal positive control, was incubated with phorbol myristate acetate  and ionomycin  in rpmi. the cultures were incubated at 5% co <dig>  37°c for 48 hours.

analysis of peripheral leukocyte secreted cytokines by enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay 
following short-term whole blood culture in vitro, the tubes were centrifuged  <dig>  g for 10 minutes, and the supernatant stored at -80°c in 100 μl aliquots for soluble cytokines quantification by elisa.

soluble cytokine levels were determined by duoset enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  to quantify il- <dig> ; tnf-α ; ifn-γ  and il- <dig> . home-standardized elisa was carried out to quantify il- <dig>  using monoclonal anti-canine il- <dig> antibody  as capture antibody; recombinant canine il- <dig>  for obtaining the standard curve and biotinylated anti-canine il- <dig> antibody , avidine peroxydase , and substrate solution .

briefly, the elisa assays were carried out by adding 25 μl of pbs-diluted monoclonal anti-cytokine to  <dig> well plates , followed by overnight incubation at room temperature. after four wash steps with pbs-tween  <dig> buffer, blocking procedures were carry out for 1 h with  <dig> % of bovine serum albumin  and  <dig> % sodium azide in pbs. following four wash steps with pbs-tween  <dig> buffer, 25 μl of culture supernatant were added to specific wells. alongside, 25 μl of serial diluted recombinant cytokine were used to establish the standard curve. the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature, washed twice with pbs-tween  <dig> and 25 μl of biotinylated anti-cytokine antibody were added to each well. after two wash steps with pbs-tween  <dig>  25 μl of avidine peroxydase diluted in pbs –  <dig> %bsa were added to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. after washing steps with pbs, 25 μl of substrate solution  were added and after 10 minutes 25 μl of stopping solution  used as a final reagent. the optical density was determined by automatic absorbance microplate reader  at a wavelength of 450 nm. minimum sensitivity of elisa were il- <dig> , tnf-α  <dig>  pg/ml), ifn-γ  and il- <dig>  as provided by the manufacturer.

immunophenotypic and intracytoplasmic cytokine staining
after short-term whole blood culture in vitro, 10 μl of brefeldin a  at 1 mg/ml was added to each tube and cultures were submitted to an additional incubation for four hours at 5% co <dig>  37°c. then, 200 μl of ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid – edta  were added to each culture tube . after 10 minutes of incubation at room temperature, cultured whole blood samples were washed with pbs supplemented with  <dig> % bovine serum albumin and  <dig> % sodium azide . the cells were resuspended in 500 μl of pbs- <dig> % bsa. aliquots of 100 μl were stained with anti-cell surface monoclonal antibodies  for 30 minutes at room temperature. after membrane staining, erythrocyte lysis, and leukocytes fixation, the cell suspension was permeabilized with pbs- <dig> % bsa buffer supplemented with  <dig> % saponin. aliquots of 50 μl were incubated in the presence of phycoerythrin fluorochrome -labeled anti-cytokines mabs , for 30 minutes at room temperature, in the dark. after intracytoplasmic cytokine staining, the leucocytes were washed with pbs- <dig> % bsa and fixed in facs fixing solution . flow cytometric measurements were performed on a facscalibur instrument  interfaced to an apple g <dig> facstation. the cell-quest™ software package provided by the manufacturer  was used for data acquisition and analysis. a total of  <dig>  events were acquired for each preparation. the frequency of cd4+ and cd8+ t-cells expressing intracytoplasmic cytokines  was determined following the conventional strategy analysis. this analysis consisted of selecting the population of interest, based in morphometric aspects, through punctual distribution of size  and granularity  graphs. after the selection of the interest region r <dig> containing fsclow ssclow phenotype cells, graphs of density plot distribution of cd4/fl <dig> or cd8/fl <dig> versus il-17a/fl <dig>  tnf-α/fl <dig>  ifn-γ/fl <dig>  tgf-β/fl <dig> or il-4/fl <dig> were made to determine the percentage of il-17a+, tnf-α+, ifn-γ+, tgf-β+ and il-4+ cells inside the previously selected lymphocytes . final data was expressed as cytokine indexes, calculated by dividing the percentage of cytokine positive cells observed in the slag-stimulated culture by the one observed in paired control unstimulated culture .table  <dig>

comparative data analysis
conventional statistical analysis
the statistical analysis was performed using the software graphpad prism  <dig> . for the data presenting a parametric distribution, for example, intracytoplasmatic cytokines, variance analysis  was used, followed by tukey test. for the non-parametric distribution, for example, secreted cytokines in the supernatant, it was performed the kruskal-wallis test, followed by dunns test. differences were considered significant at p ≤  <dig> .

comparative analysis of cytokines signatures secreted by peripheral leucocytes
cytokine signatures were compared to characterize the pattern of secreted cytokines from each animal vaccinated as suggested  <cit> . briefly, the “global median” value for each secreted cytokine was calculated by taking the whole universe of data . the “global median” was used as the cut off to tag each dog as they display “low” or “high” levels of secreted cytokines in the culture supernatant as follows:  . following the assembling of dogs categorized as “low” or “high” cytokines producers, the frequency was calculated using gray-scale diagrams for each timeline  . the ascendant frequency of high cytokine for each timeline was assessed to generate the t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> cytokine signatures  . relevant frequencies of “high cytokine producers” were considered when the percentage was above the 50th percentile. in a final step, the cytokine signatures were converted from the bar chart to line curves for overlaid comparative analysis amongst each timeline . relevant differences  were highlighted by gray background .figure  <dig> signature analysis of secreted cytokine by peripheral blood leukocytes afterin vitrostimulation withleishmania infantum soluble antigens .  establishment of the global median cut-off edges for each cytokine  used to segregate dogs as they present “low” () or “high” () cytokine levels.  gray-scale diagrams used to compile the frequency  of high cytokine producers.  ascendant cytokine signatures were assembled for each time after vaccination . the frequencies of high producers were considered relevant  when the percentage was confined over the 50th percentile .  comparative analysis of cytokine signatures were used to identify relevant differences amongst leishmune® vaccinated dogs at one , six  and twelve  months post-vaccination compared to unvaccinated dogs . gray scale rectangles were used to highlight the shift in the overall profile of pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines on each time after immunization. relevant differences  were highlighted by gray background.

discussion
previous reports have demonstrated the long lasting protection against cvl using leishmune® in endemic areas  <cit> . this investigation evaluated the kinetics of the pro-inflammatory and regulatory cellular immune response in leishmune® vaccinated dogs in a period of one year.

the immunocompetent host is able activate innate and acquired inflammatory mechanisms responsible for disease protection. in dogs, the cellular immune responses mediated by phagocytes and t-cells, primarily involving pro-inflammatory mediators  and toxic oxygen intermediates are relevant in this context. on the other hand, an impaired cellular response is consistent with susceptibility  <cit> . here, we have evaluated by a cross-sectional investigation, the cytokine profile triggered by leishmune®. the timeline kinetics of major pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines was determined over a one year period. the data observed would provide supportive insights to the animal health authorities regarding the vaccination guidelines currently recommended for the leishmune® vaccine.

our data demonstrated that a clear increase in il- <dig> and ifn-γ in the group of leishmune® vaccinated dogs at 6 months post-vaccination. in fact, ifn-γ increased in the first month after vaccination compared to non-vaccinated dogs. however, the increase of il- <dig> and ifn-γ did not last after 12 months, showing similar levels to non-vaccinated dogs. on the other hand, a decrease in il- <dig> was observed at six months after vaccination, returning to similar levels of the non-vaccinated dogs at t <dig> il- <dig> is essential for neutrophil activity during the early events of the immune response against leishmania  <cit> . in our previous studies we have demonstrated that leishmune® vaccination induced an increase in ifn-γ production by cd4+ t-cells  <cit> . the increase of those two cytokines in vaccinated dogs is consistent with the ability of leishmune® to trigger an immune response. in this context, they could be classified as immuneprotection biomarkers, since they returned to baseline at t <dig>  the regulatory cytokine il- <dig> is known to modulate the pro-inflammatory immune response, inhibiting macrophages and promoting intracellular infection. its low levels at t <dig> could support a pro-inflammatory immune profile, enabling parasite elimination  <cit> .

in this study, one innovative tool  <cit>  was also used to evaluate the cytokine profiles triggered by leishmune®. cytokine signature analysis revealed a shift in the cytokine milieu after slag stimulation. similar to our previous observations, a shift towards a pro-inflammatory profile, especially mediated by il- <dig> and ifn-γ was observed at t <dig> and t <dig>  also, signature analysis showed a clear decreased in those cytokines at t <dig> with a simultaneous increase in the frequency of regulatory cytokines, at similar levels to non-vaccinated dogs. this qualitative approach also re-enforced the use of some of those leukocyte secreted cytokines as supportive immuneprotection biomarkers. those may be useful to follow vaccination protocols after slag stimulation.

leishmania elimination by phagocytes is a crucial step for infection control and several reports have demonstrated that their effective and persistent activation are controlled by cytokines derived from the adaptive immunity  <cit> . in this context, it is likely to hypothetize that the post vaccination memory mediated by adaptive immunity cells may be important for an effective activity of the innate immune mechanisms. it has been proposed that cd4+ t-cells play a decisive role in this process through the production of cytokines and effectors mechanisms  <cit> . consistent with those observations, the analysis of the intracytoplasmic cytokine profiles in t-cell subsets supported these findings. leishmune® vaccinated dogs showed increased indexes of il-17a and tnf-α early  after primovaccination. this is similar to previous studies showing that those cytokines were related to a cvl resistance phenotype  <cit> . the analysis of t-cell subpopulations further demonstrated that cd4+ t-cells were relevant sources of tnf-α and ifn-γ. at the same time, cd8+ t-cells were an important source of il-17a and responsible for il-4decrease. the latter is associated with a regulatory response modulating the pro-inflammatory profile, inhibiting macrophage activity and promoting intracellular infection  <cit> . our results also showed an important increase of ifn-γ in cd4+ t-cells after in vitro stimulation with slag. these results were similar to those observed by l. infantum infected macrophages from dogs immunized with the vaccine liesap . additionally, their co-cultivation with total lymphocytes results in higher levels of ifn-γ  <cit> . however, our data showed a clear contribution of both cd4+ and cd8+ lymphocytes for the acquired immune responses after stimulation with slag.

CONCLUSIONS
the data observed showed that leishmune® was able to trigger changes in the immune response profiles in vaccinated dogs especially after 6 months. although it provided relevant information regarding leishmune® potential and immunization time, one of the limitations of this study relies on the genetic variability of the dogs. although they had different characteristics , it was clearly demonstrated that leishmune® vaccination was able to shift the immune response towards a pro-inflammatory profile. however, this was important to validate the vaccine status in the real context. the important finding that all biomarkers  returned to baseline after one year post vaccination re-enforced the need of boosting doses. also, it suggests their putative use as immune protection biomarkers for vaccines evaluation. the continuity of this and other studies may help to generate information to understand the immune response mechanisms during cvl immunoprophylaxis.
