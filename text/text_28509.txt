BACKGROUND
channel catfish production is now the leading aquaculture species in the u.s., with  <dig> millions pounds processed annually  <cit> . consequently, selective breeding of catfish broodstock is ongoing in order to improve the genetic potential of the species for commercial production. to support selective breeding research, molecular tools are being developed to help researchers characterize the catfish genome, which consists of  <dig> pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes, and identify genomic regions that control important production traits. however, a considerable amount of available data has not been organized within the structural framework of catfish chromosomes. briefly, framework genetic linkage maps have been produced based on microsatellite loci  <cit>  and amplified fragment length polymorphism  loci  <cit> . channel catfish expressed sequence tags  have been identified from several tissues  <cit>  and clustered and annotated in the gene index project  <cit> . a new est project is underway through the community sequencing program to sequence an additional  <dig>  cdna clones  <cit> . one cdna microarray  and one high density oligonucleotide array  <cit>  have been developed for global gene expression studies. two large-insert catfish bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries have been produced: ccbl <dig> contains a 7-fold genome equivalent of hindiii-digested genomic dna from a 3rd generation gynogenetic female  <cit> , and chori- <dig> contains a 10-fold genome equivalent of ecor1-digested genomic dna from a diploid male  <cit> . more than  <dig>  bac end sequences were recently generated from chori- <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  bac end sequences have been generated from the ccbl <dig> library . thus, a physical map of the channel catfish genome is needed to integrate the genetic map with catfish chromosomes, allowing for fine mapping of phenotypic trait alleles such as quantitative trait loci  and effective positional cloning of genes controlling economically important traits to improve germplasm. the integrated physical map will also be essential for comparative genomic analyses and the assessment of conserved synteny. in addition, a minimal tiling path provided by the physical map would provide the framework for a whole genome sequencing project  <cit> .

to date, most vertebrate physical maps have been produced based on imaging of restriction fragments in agarose gels  <cit> . though a proven technique, agarose fingerprinting is time prohibitive with limited personnel, even with the use of band calling software. as a result, alternative fluorescence-based techniques have been developed in order to make use of high-throughput dna analyzers  <cit> . we report in this study, the construction of a whole-genome bac-based fingerprinted contigs  map for catfish, ictalurus punctatus, using the  <dig> color high-information-content fingerprinting  snapshot technique  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first reported assembly of a whole-genome with the snapshot hicf in the literature though several other projects are under way . only two other hicf whole-genome maps have been built, one based on  <dig> colors fingerprinting for maize  <cit>  and one based on one color fingerprinting for tilapia  <cit> .

RESULTS
bac fingerprinting
the hicf fpc technique used by luo et al.  <cit>  was chosen as it is well suited to a high-throughput format and the snapshot labeling kit is commercially available . we fingerprinted  <dig>  clones from the hindiii ccbl <dig> catfish bac library  <cit> . this library was chosen, rather than chori- <dig>  because of the lower dna sequence polymorphism of the gynogenetic donor. in this library, three percent of the wells were empty and ten percent of the clones did not contain an insert  <cit> . also,  <dig>  clones were substituted with control clones, so approximately  <dig>  clones were effectively fingerprinted. we used the fpminer v <dig>  software  to size the dna fragments from the capillary fingerprinting chromatograms and to identify and remove the clones not meeting our quality standards. data was then exported to genoprofiler  <cit>  to remove the plate control wells and clones resulting from potential cross-contamination from the  <dig> and  <dig> well plate formats. altogether,  <dig>  fingerprinted bac clones  were analyzed with fpc software,  <dig>  were assembled into contigs and  <dig> remained singletons. the channel catfish genome size is estimated to be  <dig> gb  <cit>  and the average size of inserts is  <dig> kb  <cit> , therefore the fingerprinted bac clones represented approximately a  <dig> -fold coverage of the genome.

contig assembly
contig validation
three different approaches were used to validate the contig assembly. first,  <dig> of the largest contigs were anchored to the microsatellite-based genetic linkage map  <cit>  using markers developed from the two most terminal bacs in each contig . if no polymorphic marker was available for an end clone, markers were developed from internal bacs which assembled at a sulston score higher than 1e- <dig> as these could potentially be weaker points of the assembly. marker pairs developed within each contig displayed close genetic linkage for  <dig> of  <dig> contigs, and  <dig> contigs were placed on the catfish genetic map. the two sets of markers for contigs  <dig> and  <dig> were closely linked within each respective contig . however, these markers were not linked to any other marker on the current genetic map . one possible explanation is that these two contigs are telomeric and placement of these contigs on the genetic map will require additional linked markers. contig  <dig> was found to be the result of a false join . two of the markers present in contig  <dig> belonged to linkage group u <dig> and  <dig> markers belonged to linkage group u <dig> . if this contig represented a junction of the two linkage groups, one would expect the markers on u <dig> to be linked to the markers on u <dig>  but this was not supported by the linkage analysis. also, it was unlikely this result was due to a chimeric bac clone due to the number of clones covering the region between the markers. in the current analysis, the ratio of average contig length to average recombination distance between the most distal markers was  <dig> kb/cm, compared with  <dig> kb/cm estimated from the low resolution catfish genetic linkage map  <cit> . addition of markers to the genetic map will likely increase map length and decrease the latter estimate. while the ratio of physical to linkage distances varied within the sampled contigs , this variability was also evident in the human genome  <cit> . further integration of the linkage and physical maps will help clarify this relationship in the catfish genome. this limited analysis produced a contig assembling error estimated at 5%. similarly, 4% of false joins were found when the maize genome was assembled using the  <dig> color fingerprinting hicf fpc technique  <cit> . while the rate of misassembly between two clones should be constant, the probably of a contig containing a false join should be proportional to the number of clones in the contig. since our analysis was skewed toward the largest contigs, containing  <dig> to  <dig> clones, the whole map error rate may be lower. the current validation does not exclude that a few bac clones could be placed in the wrong contig. nevertheless the successful anchoring  <dig> of the largest contigs to the microsatellite linkage map attests to the overall reliability of the contigs and the physical map.

as a second validation, the grouping of the major histocompatibility complex  class i multigene family was examined to determine if clones containing these genes would be correctly assembled using this hicf technique. mhc class i genes were chosen as the extensive multigenicity of mhc i genes in channel catfish has been shown  <cit> . twenty-one of the clones previously identified by pcr screening of the ccbl <dig> bac library with a mhc class i alpha  <dig> domain primer pair were examined  <cit> . those clones were then grouped either by capillary fingerprinting or by southern blot pattern following a dra i digest and hybridization with a mhc class i alpha  <dig> domain probe. figure  <dig> shows the southern blot pattern obtained for each clone. the restriction patterns were segregated into groups a, b, or c. clones within each group shared one or more bands . each common band within the group presumably represented a shared mhc i gene between overlapping bacs. depending on the extent of their overlap, bac clones shared different bands or even had some unique bands within a group depending on their location in the genome. the remaining  <dig> bac clones grouped consistently with the observed southern blot patterns: a, b, and c corresponded to contigs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, thus confirming the correct assembly of those bac clones in contigs. five mhc class i bac clones were eliminated from the assembly during the quality check of the fingerprinting as they had either too few or too many bands to fit our standards. however, a separate assembly that included these lower quality clones showed that they still mapped according to their grouping in the southern blot analysis.

third, the validity of the assembly was also confirmed by the ongoing sequencing of the channel catfish immunoglobulin heavy chain locus  <cit> . two structurally related genomic clusters of catfish immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region gene segments are known and the distance between the two has been estimated at  <dig> kb  <cit> . six bac clones representing the two clusters were identified  <cit> . those clones from the non-arrayed ccbl <dig> library were independently fingerprinted, and were localized to two contigs . one clone from each contig/cluster was selected for sequencing and adjacent clones were identified for sequencing using the minimum tiling path and bac end sequence markers. no discrepancies were found in the assembly of those two contigs when sequencing the clones. even though fpc could not join those two contigs because the overlap was too small, sequence analysis demonstrated one of the clones from ccbl <dig> in contig  <dig> overlapped with clones gy079k <dig> and gy099l <dig> in contig  <dig> by  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb, respectively .

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first whole-genome physical map of the channel catfish. by adapting the snapshot based technique to a high-throughput dna analyzer, we were able to fingerprint a whole genome in a relatively short period of time with limited human resources . the resulting stage  <dig> map was assembled with an initial sulston score of 1e- <dig> to maintain a conservative core of contigs as the backbone for further analysis. the validation studies confirmed the reliability of this assembly. we are currently integrating this physical map with our other catfish genomic resources most notably the genetic map  <cit> , to enable qtl studies, comparative genomic analyses and fine mapping of genes to assist in identification of markers associated with economically important traits such as such as disease resistance, growth rates and carcass yield.
