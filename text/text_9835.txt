BACKGROUND
acute injury to the central nervous system  is associated with secondary degeneration involving both neurons and glia neighbouring the lesion, resulting in further functional loss  <cit> . mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical component of cns injury  <cit> . intracellular ca2+ concentrations are disturbed both at and adjacent to the injury  <cit> , and mitochondria take up excess ca2+ to maintain homeostasis in the cytosol  <cit> . however, excess mitochondrial ca2+ may lead to the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, with resultant impairment in mitochondrial function and metabolic activity and/or cell death  <cit> . further, mitochondria are a major source of reactive oxygen species , the production of which is increased with elevated mitochondrial ca2+ concentrations  <cit> . we have previously demonstrated both altered ca2+ distributions and oxidative stress in white matter vulnerable to secondary degeneration  <cit> .

mitochondria are able to respond to the changing energy needs of the cell, as well as perform their own damage control, through their ability to divide  or fuse  <cit> . these processes are mediated by gtpases  <cit>  and are partly regulated by ca2+ levels, with influx of ca2+ through voltage-gated ca2+ channels causing increased mitochondrial fission in vitro <cit> . impairments in the balance between fission and fusion can lead to disruptions in mitochondrial motility, atp generation and ca2+ buffering. such changes have been described in a number of pathological situations, including neurodegenerative disorders, stroke models and conditions of oxidative stress  <cit> , but mitochondrial densities and ultrastructure have not yet been assessed in vivo in white matter vulnerable to secondary degeneration.

it was hypothesised that the balance of mitochondrial fission/fusion would alter as a feature of secondary degeneration in vivo. accordingly, using the partial optic nerve  transection model of secondary degeneration  <cit> , we assessed density of mitochondrial profiles to analyse possible changes in vivo <cit> . further, area and shape of mitochondrial profiles were assessed, as these aspects of mitochondrial structure have been shown to be related to osmotic conditions, altered mitochondrial function and may also reflect changes associated with fission and/or fusion  <cit> . citrate synthase activity is widely used as an indicator of mitochondrial mass  <cit>  and was assessed here as an adjunct to the ultrastructural analyses, together with mitochondrial aconitase activity, which has been shown to be susceptible to certain reactive species  <cit>  that may contribute to secondary degeneration.

red/near-infrared irradiation therapy  has been used as a safe treatment for a range of cns disorders and injuries  <cit>  and is currently being assessed in clinical trials for stroke  <cit> . the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase has been posited as the most likely photoacceptor for r/nir-it  <cit> , and treatment is associated with improvements in oxidative metabolism, including increased atp production  <cit> . we have demonstrated that r/nir-it results in reduced oxidative stress and preservation of function in on vulnerable to secondary degeneration  <cit> . however, the effects of r/nir-it on mitochondrial ultrastructure and citric acid cycle enzyme activities in cns injury and secondary degeneration in vivo have not yet been assessed. here we show that mitochondria exhibit subtle ultrastructural changes during secondary degeneration, as well as an increased appearance of mitochondrial autophagic profiles. following r/nir-it, the mitochondrial area and shape changes seen during secondary degeneration were no longer observed, and mitochondrial autophagic profiles were reduced.

RESULTS
density of mitochondrial profiles did not change in areas of on vulnerable to secondary degeneration +/− r/nir-it
mitochondria can respond to stress in part by altering the balance between fission and fusion  <cit> . it was hypothesised that such an alteration would be reflected in a change of mitochondrial numbers following injury, indicated by the number of mitochondrial profiles in tem images from transverse on sections  <cit> . we assessed mitochondrial profiles at  <dig> and 7 days after injury, as we have already demonstrated that the oxidative stress response is well established at 1 day  <cit>  and mitochondrial ultrastructure changes as a response to oxidative stress may be beginning to resolve at 7 days. the densities of mitochondrial profiles were separately quantified for axonal and glial cellular compartments. axons were clearly identified by the surrounding electron dense myelin sheath and glial compartments were defined as the non-axonal areas within the image . mitochondria were identified on the basis of a clear double membrane, increased electron density and/or the presence of convolutions . it was not necessary to correct density values for ventral on area as there was no change in the area of the ventral region observed with injury, at the time points assessed in the current study . furthermore, no significant differences between control groups were detected  for any of the tem outcomes ; therefore data from these groups were pooled. there were no significant changes in mean mitochondrial density with injury or r/nir-it, in either axonal or glial cellular compartments . this implies that mitochondrial fission was not a feature of secondary degeneration in this model, at  <dig> and 7 days after injury.

area and shape changes of mitochondrial profiles in on vulnerable to secondary degeneration +/− r/nir-it
aspects of mitochondrial structure, including size and shape, are related to function  <cit> . we therefore assessed cross-sectional area of mitochondrial profiles  in order to detect changes occurring as a consequence of secondary degeneration. mean area of mitochondrial profiles was not significantly different following pt injury or r/nir-it in either axons  or glia . however, comparison of frequency distributions of mitochondrial area  revealed subtle differences not apparent in means comparisons. at day  <dig> after pt, there was a significant change in the distribution of areas of axonal mitochondrial profiles in ventral on vulnerable to secondary degeneration , with an increase in the cumulative probability of smaller mitochondria following injury. no significant change was observed at day  <dig> compared to normal in axonal mitochondria . following r/nir-it, the frequency distribution of areas of axonal mitochondrial profiles was no longer significantly different from normal animals , and there was a shift in the cumulative probabilities towards larger mitochondria compared to injured animals . there was no statistically significant effect of r/nir-it on the distribution of axonal mitochondrial area at day  <dig> . mitochondria are generally longitudinally aligned along the on  <cit> . therefore the lengths of axonal mitochondria were also assessed in longitudinal sections from a separate cohort of animals. pilot data indicated that mitochondrial length did not change at 1 day after injury in on vulnerable to secondary degeneration .

in glia, no significant change in the distribution of mitochondrial profile areas was observed due to secondary degeneration at day  <dig> , or at day  <dig> . despite this, and in contrast to effects observed in axonal compartments, r/nir-it resulted in a reduction in glial mitochondrial profile area at day  <dig> after injury, as reflected by an increase in the cumulative probability of smaller mitochondria in injured animals . however, the difference in distribution was not significantly different when compared to normal animals  .

for every mitochondrial profile assessed, a ratio between the minimum and maximum diameter was generated , providing a quantitative assessment of mitochondrial profile shape. ratios closer to  <dig> reflect more circular profiles, while larger ratios represent more elliptical shapes. representative images of mitochondria exhibiting different ratios are displayed in figure 3a. similarly to analyses of mitochondrial profile area, there were no differences in mean mitochondrial profile shape following pt injury or r/nir-it in axons  or glia . analyses of frequency distributions of mitochondrial profile shape showed that while there was a trend towards more elliptical profiles, there were no statistically significant changes in the distributions of mitochondrial profile shape in secondary degeneration in axons at either day  <dig>  or day  <dig> . while r/nir-it had no effect on these distributions when compared to injured animals in axons at day  <dig>  or day  <dig> , distributions indicated an increasingly elliptical shape compared to normal animals at day  <dig>  but not at day  <dig> .

in glia, the distribution of mitochondrial profile shapes was significantly altered towards a higher probability of more elliptical profiles , and this was also observed at day  <dig> . following r/nir-it, the distribution of mitochondrial profile shapes was significantly less elliptical compared to the untreated group at 7 days after injury  and was no longer significantly different from normal at either day  <dig>  or day  <dig> . r/nir-it did not significantly alter the distribution of mitochondrial profile shape compared to the untreated group at 1 day after injury , but distributions were also not different from normal . this finding suggests that r/nir-it either prevented the change in mitochondrial profile shape seen in secondary degeneration, or restored normal shape.

mitochondrial autophagy in on vulnerable to secondary degeneration +/− r/nir-it
ultrastructural analyses of mitochondria revealed a small subset which featured second double membranes, very high electro-density and/ or vacuole-like features, clearly indicative of autophagic processes  <cit> , and which precluded their inclusion in density analyses described to this point. the envelopment of mitochondria in autophagic membranes is suggestive of their elimination by mitophagy . however definitive identification of mitophagy  is hampered by lack of selective markers applicable to both axons and glia  <cit> , the fact that structural features in tem images can be equivocal and that structural and chemical features of autophagy in tissue sections in vivo are yet to be fully characterised  <cit> . therefore, these structures were classified as mitochondrial autophagic profiles and their incidence quantified per field of view . the incidence of mitochondrial autophagic profiles in ventral on was significantly higher at days  <dig> and  <dig> after injury compared to normal . treatment with r/nir-it did not affect the incidence of mitochondrial autophagic profiles compared to injured animals at day  <dig> . at day  <dig> however, r/nir-it resulted in a smaller number of mitochondrial autophagic profiles compared to injured animals , with numbers not significantly different from normal .

aconitase and citrate synthase activities in on following pt injury +/− r/nir-it
the activities of the mitochondrial enzymes aconitase and citrate synthase were assessed in homogenates of both dorsal on exposed to the primary injury and ventral on vulnerable to secondary degeneration . aconitase activity has been shown to be inhibited by certain species of ros  <cit>  and as such has been used to indicate altered mitochondrial function due to oxidative stress  <cit> . citrate synthase was assessed as an adjunct to the tem analyses of mitochondrial density and size, to provide an additional marker of mitochondrial content  <cit> . pt injury led to significant differences in mean activity for both aconitase  and citrate synthase . follow up anovas and bonferroni post hoc tests demonstrated significant increases in aconitase activity compared to normal at days  <dig> and  <dig> after injury in ventral on  and significant decreases in citrate synthase activity compared to normal in ventral on at day  <dig>  and in dorsal on at day  <dig> . no statistically significant differences in dorsal on aconitase activity were detected , likely due to relatively high s.e.m in the normal group .

following r/nir-it, aconitase activity was increased in both dorsal and ventral on  at day  <dig> after injury . r/nir-it also affected citrate synthase activity in both dorsal and ventral on as follows ; while activity was significantly decreased in ventral on at day  <dig> after injury  activity was significantly increased in dorsal on  .

discussion
we have demonstrated that in on vulnerable to secondary degeneration, densities of mitochondrial profiles were not altered, indicating no change to the balance of fission and fusion. more detailed analyses of distributions of mitochondrial size and shape revealed subtle alterations during secondary degeneration. axonal mitochondrial profiles were smaller 1 day following injury, perhaps indicating a tendency towards fission, or alternatively, shrinkage in response to changing osmotic conditions. in contrast, glial mitochondrial profile area did not change, but profiles were more elliptical at days  <dig> and  <dig> after pt injury. while the observation of elliptical profiles depends upon the sectioning of the tissue, increased frequency of elliptical profiles together with no change in area indicates that on average, mitochondria in glia were becoming longer and thinner, perhaps indicating fusion. however the lack of increase in density of mitochondrial profiles indicates that these changes were relatively minor and marked alteration in the balance of fission/fusion in on vulnerable to secondary degeneration at day  <dig> is unlikely. our findings are of interest as they are in contrast to reported increases in fission as a consequence of stroke  <cit> , although changes at earlier time points may occur. importantly, there was a significant increase in the appearance of mitochondrial autophagic profiles at days  <dig> and  <dig> in on vulnerable to secondary degeneration, as has been reported in a range of cns injury models  <cit> , indicating vulnerability of mitochondria to secondary degeneration.

the lack of change in citrate synthase activity in on at day  <dig> after injury reflected the unchanged density of mitochondrial profiles at this time, indicating that mitochondrial volume was maintained. however, despite constant mitochondrial density, citrate synthase activity decreased in ventral on at day  <dig>  perhaps due to the demonstrated inhibition of this enzyme by alkyl peroxyl and alkoxyl radicals  <cit> , which are elevated following traumatic brain injury  <cit> . in contrast, we observed increases in aconitase activity in ventral on. given that we did not observe greater mitochondrial density in ventral on after injury, we can exclude that the increase in aconitase reflects more mitochondria. aconitase is known to be inhibited by ros such as superoxide  <cit> , h2o <dig> <cit> , and peroxynitrite  <cit> . coupled with our reported increase in mnsod immunointensity at  <dig> and 7 days after partial on transection  <cit> , these data suggest that superoxide levels are effectively controlled by endogenous mechanisms in our model. an approximately 50% increase in aconitase activity has been reported following repeated contractions of mouse skeletal muscle, despite increased ros production  <cit> , but mechanisms are unclear and further work is required to understand the effects of secondary degeneration on the activity of citric acid cycle enzymes.

r/nir-it prevented the subtle decrease in axonal mitochondrial profile size, suggesting that for this outcome, normal mitochondrial ultrastructure was either maintained despite injury, or restored within the first 24 hours with r/nir-it. similarly, following r/nir-it in pt injured on, mitochondrial shape in glia was no longer different from normal. importantly, the appearance of mitochondrial autophagic profiles observed in on vulnerable to secondary degeneration was also reduced by r/nir-it at day  <dig>  the finding that r/nir-it partly prevented the changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure seen in secondary degeneration in vivo is in line with previous studies reporting beneficial effects of r/nir-it on mitochondrial metabolism associated with functional improvements. these include increased visual pathway and whole-brain metabolism as assessed using cytochrome c oxidase activity and oxygen consumption  <cit> , recovery of rod and cone-mediated function after inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase with formic acid derived from the in vivo breakdown of methanol  <cit> , as well as reductions in markers of oxidative stress  <cit> . our findings suggest that these improvements in oxidative metabolism with r/nir-it could be in part due to preservation of normal mitochondrial structure, which goes hand-in-hand with normal mitochondrial function  <cit> . by extension, improvements in the structure of mitochondria may explain the improvements in visual function previously reported in our model following r/nir-it  <cit> .

very few studies have examined the effect of r/nir-it on mitochondrial morphology, and these have used in vitro models of non-cns systems. in human lymphocytes, irradiation with he-ne laser  resulted in the formation of giant, branched mitochondria at 1 hour post-treatment  <cit> . these were shown to be due to fusion of smaller mitochondria and proposed to be more efficient at energy transfer  <cit> . giant mitochondria have been described in rat axon hillocks  <cit> , with a characteristic diameter of approximately 1 μm, but were not observed in the present study. structural changes of the giant mitochondrion normally present in yeast cells after irradiation with he-ne laser have also been investigated  <cit>  and it was found that eighteen hours after irradiation, the mitochondrial matrix had expanded, providing conditions more favourable to energy transfer in the form of membrane potential. a similar scenario could be responsible for a restoration of axonal mitochondrial profiles to normal size by day  <dig> in the current model and the increasingly elliptical shape of mitochondria in axons compared to normal at day  <dig>  however, it is also possible that mitochondrial size was simply maintained and/or increased via a protective effect due to increased cytochrome c oxidase activity, as has been reported with r/nir-it  <cit> , prevention of reverse electron transport and maintenance of the mitochondrial permeability transition  <cit>  or restoration of normal osmotic conditions. r/nir-it also prevented the shift towards more elliptical mitochondrial profiles that was observed in glia at day  <dig> and  <dig> in on vulnerable to secondary degeneration. as a number of pathological circumstances result in a transition from elliptical, rod-like mitochondria to more rounded mitochondria, it is unclear whether the increasingly elliptical shape seen after pt injury reflects functional impairment, or is perhaps a reflection of cytoskeletal changes following injury  <cit> . similarly, the altered citrate synthase activity and increased aconitase activity observed following r/nir-it could reflect impairment as a consequence of irradiation, but the complexities in the responses to injury of these enzymes indicates that more detailed analyses are required to understand these effects and ascertain whether these changes in enzyme activity are more or less important than the observed structural restorations. further, given the host of studies reporting beneficial effects of r/nir-ir on mitochondrial function, it is unlikely that the observed alterations in enzyme activities are detrimental  <cit> . r/nir-it resulted in increased relative matrix surface area in yeast mitochondria  <cit>  and this improves their aerobic capacity  <cit> , however assessment of cristae was beyond the scope of the current study.

CONCLUSIONS
mitochondria exhibit both structural and functional changes in secondary degeneration, which are likely to play an important role in the pathophysiology of this process. we have provided evidence that r/nir-it has potentially beneficial effects on mitochondrial structure in secondary degeneration and can also affect citric acid cycle activity. understanding the mechanism by which r/nir-it exerts its positive effects on function is valuable, as this therapy is both clinically relevant and readily translatable, offering an exciting candidate for treatment of secondary degeneration following injury to the cns.
