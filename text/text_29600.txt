BACKGROUND
one of the most important events in the control of gene expression is the regulation of transcription initiation. transcription of eukaryotic protein-coding genes by rna polymerase ii involves a tightly regulated sequence of steps including decondensation of the locus, nucleosome remodeling, histone modifications, binding of transcriptional activators and coactivators to enhancers and promoters that culminates in the recruitment of the basal transcription machinery to the core promoter  <cit> . the basal transcription machinery comprises a set of factors, including rna polymerase ii, that are minimally essential for in vitro transcription from an isolated core promoter, whereas the rna polymerase ii core promoter has been defined as a cis-regulatory module whose function is to direct the initiation of transcription  <cit> .

recent studies have revealed that the structure and function of core promoters is more diverse than previously thought. the majority of the eukaryotic core promoters are classified as focused core promoters  <cit> . in a focused core promoter transcription starts at a single nucleotide or within a distinct cluster of start sites in a short region of several nucleotides. studies in vertebrates have also revealed a second type of core promoter, named dispersed core promoters, in which several weak transcription start sites are distributed over a broad region ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides  <cit> .

even though there are apparently no universal core promoter elements, molecular studies on focused core promoters have identified and characterized sequence motifs that are characteristic of core promoters such as the inr , tata box, bre , dpe , mte  and dce   <cit> . central to the transcription initiation process is the binding of tbp  to dna at a specific distance from the transcription start site, regardless of the presence or absence of a tata box. the core promoter motifs usually work in cooperation and biochemical studies have demonstrated synergism between different pairs of core promoter motifs  <cit> . these studies of core promoter motifs have been further extended by the use of computational approaches  <cit> . furthermore, core promoter function is not restricted to the binding of general transcription factors. several studies have shown the existence of specificity between enhancers and core promoters demonstrating that core promoter motifs constitute cis-regulatory elements that participate in transcriptional regulation  <cit>  and are an important component in transcriptional networks  <cit> .

focused core promoters have also been identified in the regulatory region of sciarid dna puff genes  <cit> . in addition to rna puffs, which are of general occurrence in diptera, the polytene chromosomes of sciarid flies also present dna puffs that are formed at discrete sites in the salivary gland polytene chromosomes at the end the last larval instar. the molecular characterization of dna puffs revealed that they constitute sites of developmentally regulated gene amplification and transcription  <cit> . these three processes, gene amplification, gene expression and dna puff formation are all induced in the salivary glands as a late response to the increased ecdysone levels that trigger metamorphosis  <cit> .

earlier studies have shown that the bhc4- <dig> dna puff gene of the sciarid bradysia hygida is amplified 21-fold and is abundantly transcribed in the salivary gland when dna puff c <dig> is formed at the end of the fourth larval instar  <cit> . the characterization of the mechanisms that regulate bhc4- <dig> expression have been extended through functional studies performed in transgenic drosophila, and have resulted in the identification of cis-regulatory elements in the bhc4- <dig> promoter region  <cit> . similar to events in the sciarid, in transgenic drosophila bhc4- <dig> expression in the salivary gland is induced as a late response to the increase in ecdysone levels  <cit> . in addition, genetic interaction experiments have shown that the bhc4- <dig> cis-regulatory elements are recognized by trans-activating factors of d. melanogaster, indicating that the regulatory mechanisms of bhc4- <dig> transcription in the salivary gland are highly conserved in d. melanogaster  <cit> .

functional studies performed in the bhc4- <dig> promoter region resulted in the identification of a  <dig> bp fragment  that could not drive detectable levels of β-galactosidase activity and that contained sequences similar to core promoter elements  <cit> . in this paper, we initially demonstrate that the  <dig> bp  bhc4- <dig> promoter fragment drives low levels of bhc4-1-lacz mrna expression throughout development. the few studies available that have investigated core promoters through functional assays in a chromosomal context have shown that the response of a given core promoter can vary depending on the enhancer that is being tested  <cit> . in this context, we investigated the  <dig> bp  bhc4- <dig> core promoter fragment in two distinct regulatory frameworks: downstream of the previously characterized d. melanogaster fbp <dig>  enhancer  <cit>  and downstream of  <dig> copies of the uas element, in the context of the gal4/uas system  <cit> . our results reveal that the bhc4- <dig> core promoter drives regulated transcription in the germline and in various tissues at different developmental stages, regardless of the regulatory framework that is being tested. additionally, our results provide novel insights regarding the functioning of the gal4/uas system in both the germline and in the larval salivary gland of d. melanogaster.

RESULTS
the bhc4- <dig> core promoter drives basal levels of bhc4-1-lacz expression throughout development
previous studies from our group have suggested that a  <dig> bp  fragment contained the bhc4- <dig> core promoter  <cit> . this suggestion was derived both from functional assays demonstrating that lines transformed with a  construct did not present detectable levels of β-galactosidase expression, and from sequence analysis showing the presence of a tata box located  <dig> bp upstream from the initiator element  in the  fragment   <cit> .

here we have extended the analysis of the  sequence and identified two additional motifs that are prevalent in insect core promoters  <cit> . a sequence similar  to the motif  <dig> element  is found between positions  and a sequence similar  to the motif ten element   is found between positions  . the motif  <dig> element does not seem to have a preferential localization in core promoters and, at present, the transcription factors that bind to this motif have not been identified  <cit> . the motif ten element  is bound by the tfiid complex, is localized downstream of the inr element between positions , and there is a strict spacing requirement between the inr and the mte   <cit> . in the bhc4- <dig> core promoter the sequence similar to the mte is found further downstream of the transcription start site  , and hence this sequence most likely does not contribute to the binding of the basal transcriptional machinery.

as explained above, lines transformed with the  construct did not present detectable levels of β-galactosidase expression. in order to verify if the lack of β-galactosidase expression in lines transformed with the  construct   <cit>  was due to the absence of bhc4-1-lacz mrna transcription, we performed rnase protection assays in two independent lines transformed with the  construct. in both transgenic lines, low levels of bhc4-1-lacz mrna expression were detected at all developmental stages analyzed . bhc4-1-lacz mrna expression is not detected in the control, total rna extracted from embryos of the parental strain, y,w, , indicating that there is no endogenous bhc4-1-lacz mrna expression in the parental strain. the pattern of bhc4-1-lacz mrna expression in the two independent transgenic lines is similar, indicating that it constitutes the pattern of expression of the transgene and is not the result of position effects. the suggestion that the detected bhc4-1-lacz mrna is a transcription product driven by the bhc4- <dig> core promoter is further supported by the fact that the vector employed to build the  construct, pcasper-aug-βgal does not contain promoter sequences upstream of the lacz reporter gene  <cit> . in this context, we conclude that the  <dig> bp  bhc4- <dig> core promoter drives low levels of transcription throughout development, and attribute the absence of detectable levels of β-galactosidase activity in these lines to the expression of low levels of bhc4-1-lacz mrna in the  lines.

the components of the basal transcription machinery that bind to the  <dig> bp  bhc4- <dig> promoter fragment have not yet been identified. however, since in transgenesis the  <dig> bp  fragment drives low levels of bhc4-1-lacz mrna transcription throughout development, and the spacing between the tata box and the inr is compatible with the spacing described for these motifs in core promoters  <cit> , we propose that these two motifs are relevant for the function of the bhc4- <dig> core promoter.

the interaction between the sciarid bhc4- <dig> core promoter and the drosophilid fbp <dig> enhancer results in enhancer-dependent transgene expression
functional studies of the bhc4- <dig> promoter have identified a salivary gland enhancer  that drives gene expression in prepupal salivary glands, and a ring gland enhancer  that promotes expression in the ring gland of late embryos and throughout the larval and prepupal stages  <cit> . in order to verify if the sciarid bhc4- <dig> core promoter could drive expression in another tissue when placed downstream of a heterologous tissue specific enhancer, we generated transgenic lines transformed with the fbp1- <dig> bp construct . this construct contains a  <dig> bp  fat body enhancer from the d. melanogaster fbp <dig> gene  <cit>  which was cloned upstream the  <dig> bp  bhc4- <dig> core promoter in the pcasper-aug-β-gal vector  <cit> . β-galactosidase activity was assayed in nine independent transgenic lines and representative results obtained for one of the lines are shown in figure  <dig>  analysis of staged animals of the fbp1- <dig> bp lines revealed that reporter gene expression in the fat body starts between  <dig> h to  <dig> h after egg deposition and continues to be detected in this tissue throughout the prepupal and pupal stages . in drosophila, fbp <dig> expression is restricted to the fat body, starts in third instar larvae before the onset of wandering, continues during the prepupal stage and decreases at the beginning of the pupal stage  <cit> . in this context, we conclude that the pattern of expression of the fbp1- <dig> bp transgene is similar to the pattern of expression of the endogenous fbp <dig> gene.

in lines transformed with a construct containing the  fbp <dig> enhancer cloned upstream the hsp <dig> core promoter, reporter gene expression was consistently detected both in the fat body and in the anterior region of the salivary gland  <cit> . in the fbp1- <dig> bp lines, reporter gene activity was restricted to the fat body. it is possible that the bhc4- <dig> core promoter presents tissue specific differences in activity that precludes its activation in the salivary gland.

when either the bhc4- <dig> salivary gland enhancer or the bhc4- <dig> ring gland enhancer were tested upstream of the  fbp <dig> core promoter, high levels of developmentally regulated reporter gene expression were observed  <cit> , indicating that the enhancers and core promoters of both bhc4- <dig> and fbp <dig> genes are interchangeable. one possible explanation for this interchangeability is the fact that both are ecdysone responsive genes that are expressed in a developmentally regulated manner in specific tissues  <cit> . in summary, we conclude that the developmentally regulated pattern of reporter gene expression observed in the fat body of the fbp1- <dig> bp lines is driven by the interaction between the bhc4- <dig> sciarid core promoter and the fbp <dig> fat body enhancer of d. melanogaster.

the bhc4- <dig> core promoter drives regulated transcription in the context of the gal4/uas system
the gal4/uas system has been extensively employed to drive tissue-specific expression of genes of interest in drosophila  <cit> . in order to test whether the  bhc4- <dig> core promoter could drive efficient transcription in the context of the gal4/uas system, we exchanged the hsp <dig> core promoter for the  bhc4- <dig> core promoter in the puast vector  <cit> . the gfp coding sequence was cloned downstream of the bhc4- <dig> core promoter and the resulting construct, uas- <dig> bp,  was inserted into drosophila by germline transformation. the resulting four transgenic lines did not present gfp expression in any developmental stage and/or tissue, as verified by fluorescence stereoscopy and microscopy .

in order to investigate if the bhc4- <dig> core promoter could drive gene expression during embryogenesis, we crossed the uas- <dig> bp lines with the gal4-twi.2xpe driver. in this line, gal <dig> expression in the ventral region of early embryos is driven by two copies of the proximal element , previously characterized in the promoter region of the twist gene  <cit> . in early uas- <dig> bp/gal4-twi.2xpe embryos gfp expression is detected in the ventral region of early embryos and also in the posterior and anterior regions of the embryo . since in uas- <dig> bp/gal4-twi.2xpe embryos gfp expression was not restricted to the ventral region, we crossed the gal4-twi.2xpe line with the uas-gfp.s65t line, a uas-gfp line that has been previously used in studies that employed the gal4/uas system  <cit> . a similar pattern of gfp expression was observed in the uas-gfp.s65t/gal4-twi.2xpe embryos . together these results reveal that the bhc4- <dig> core promoter drives transcription during embryogenesis in the context of the gal4/uas system and in a pattern analogous to that observed when a previously characterized uas line is employed.

in order to investigate whether the bhc4- <dig> core promoter could drive expression in the germline, we crossed the uas- <dig> bp lines with the gal4::vp16-nos.utr line that expresses gal <dig> in the germ cells  <cit> . in whole ovaries of uas- <dig> bp; gal4::vp16-nos.utr adult females, gfp expression is verified in the germarium that is localized at the tip of the ovaries , whereas gfp expression is not detectable in the germarium of ovaries of control uas- <dig> bp adult females . when dissected uas- <dig> bp; gal4::vp16-nos.utr ovaries were analyzed using confocal microscopy, we also detected gfp expression in later stages of oogenesis . we attributed the fluorescence observed in later stages of oogenesis and detected in the ovaries of both uas- <dig> bp; gal4::vp16-nos.utr and uas- <dig> bp adults to autofluorescence of the yolk . the autofluorescence from the yolk, with a wavelength in the  <dig> nm -  <dig> nm range, was not detected when the ovaries were analyzed in the confocal microscope configured to capture only the fluorescence emitted by gfp . together, these results show that in uas- <dig> bp; gal4::vp16-nos.utr ovaries gfp is expressed in a pattern similar to that described for the nanos transcript  <cit> .

one limitation of the original gal4/uas system was the inability to work in the germline during oogenesis  <cit> . this restriction was overcome with utilization of the uasp vector in which the d. melanogaster hsp <dig> core promoter, part of the original puast vector, was substituted by the minimal promoter and first intron of the d. melanogaster p transposase gene  <cit> . in the uasp vector, the 3' end sv <dig> sequence of puast was substituted by the 3' utr of k <dig>  and it has been suggested that the ability of a uas construct to work in the germline depended on both the core promoter and on the 3' sequences  <cit> . the uas- <dig> bp construct contains the 3' end sv <dig> sequence which is part of the original puast vector  <cit> . at present we cannot rule out the possibility that the 3' end sv <dig> sequence might affect the p transposase promoter in the context of the uasp vector. however, since gfp expression was detected in ovaries of uas- <dig> bp; gal4::vp16-nos.utr females , we suggest that the 3' utr sequences tested to date  most likely do not interfere with the transactivation of a uas construct in the germline.

we next crossed the uas- <dig> bp lines with two drivers that express gal <dig> in two distinct larval tissues. the lsp2-gal <dig> line expresses gal <dig> in the larval, prepupal and pupal fat body according to the pattern of expression of the lsp <dig> gene  <cit> . the gal4-gmr line expresses gal <dig> in all cells posterior to the morphogenetic furrow  <cit> . fluorescence stereoscopy of third instar larvae revealed gfp expression both in the fat body of uas- <dig> bp; lsp2-gal <dig> animals  and in the posterior region of eye imaginal discs of uas- <dig> bp/gal4-gmr larvae . in both cases gfp expression was clearly differentiated from the autofluorescence present in larvae of either the parental line, yw , or the uas- <dig> bp lines  or the lsp2-gal <dig> line  or the gal4-gmr lines , showing that the observed patterns of gfp expression were driven by the respective gal <dig> drivers.

these results revealed that in the context of the gal4/uas system the bhc4- <dig> core promoter drives regulated transcription in developmental times  and tissues  other than those in which the bhc4- <dig> enhancers have been shown to drive reporter gene expression, namely the ring gland of late embryos, larvae and prepupae and the prepupal salivary glands  <cit> . the results verified in both the uas- <dig> bp lines and in the fbp1- <dig> bp lines agree with those previously obtained with the  and  lines  <cit> , and indicate that the regulated expression driven by the  bhc4- <dig> core promoter in transgenic drosophila depends on the regulatory sequences placed upstream the  fragment. our data are in contrast with those recently reported in tribolium castaneum showing that transactivation of the gal4/uas system was only achieved when an endogenous core promoter was employed in both the driver and responder constructs  <cit> . one possibility is that d. melanogaster is more permissive towards the use of a heterologous core promoter. a further possibility is that because of the greater evolutionary distance between the dipteran drosophila and the coleopteran tribolium, the proteins and dna sequences involved in promoter recognition have diverged more than between the two dipteran drosophila and bradysia. in this sense, we suggest that the bhc4- <dig> core promoter might constitute an attractive alternative core promoter to be employed in other insect systems that are amenable to transformation.

the presence of the bhc4- <dig> core promoter in a uas construct reduces the levels of ectopic salivary gland expression that are intrinsic to the gal4/uas system
as explained in the previous section, similar patterns of expression were observed in embryos when the same gal <dig> driver, gal4-twi.2xpe, was crossed either with the uas- <dig> bp lines or with the previously employed uas-gfp.s65t line . a distinct result was obtained when we compared the pattern of gfp expression in uas- <dig> bp/gal4-gmr larvae  with the pattern of gfp expression in uas-gfp.s65t/gal4-gmr larvae . in the uas-gfp.s65t/gal4-gmr larvae, gfp expression was detected both in the eye imaginal discs and in the salivary glands , whereas in the uas- <dig> bp/gal4-gmr larvae gfp expression was only observed in the eye imaginal discs . to investigate if the difference between these two transactivation patterns could be due to variations in the uas lines, we crossed a second gal <dig> line, pptgal <dig>  with either the uas- <dig> bp line or with the uas-gfp.s65t line. the transgenic line pptgal <dig> contains one copy of the pptgal vector  <cit>  and expresses gal <dig> in the salivary gland. in uas-gfp.s65t; pptgal <dig> larvae, strong gfp expression was observed in the larval salivary glands , whereas in uas- <dig> bp; pptgal <dig> larvae gfp expression is barely detected in the salivary glands . together, these results reveal that distinct patterns of transactivation can be produced in larvae when a given gal <dig> driver is crossed with two distinct uas lines.

the differences observed in gfp expression in the salivary gland when the two different uas lines were employed cannot be attributed to the gfp variant being used because both constructs contain the s65t variant  <cit> , nor to differences in the 3' utr because both constructs contain the 3' utr sv <dig> sequence of the original puast vector  <cit> . furthermore, since similar results were obtained when independent uas- <dig> bp lines were crossed with the same gal <dig> drivers , we could rule out the contribution of position effects.

we propose that the observed differences in ectopic gfp expression in the salivary gland of larvae when either uas line was employed can be attributed to several factors. the results with the pptgal lines  confirm that ectopic salivary gland expression in the context of the gal4/uas system can be attributed to the gal <dig> component of the gal4/uas system, as previously suggested when the gal4/uas system in d. melanogaster was originally described  <cit> . in addition, our results indicate that the uas component also contributes to ectopic salivary gland expression in the context of the gal4/uas system. specifically, we suggest that the substitution of the d. melanogaster hsp <dig> core promoter present in uas-gfp.s65t construct by the sciarid bhc4- <dig> core promoter in the uas- <dig> bp construct led to a strong reduction in salivary gland ectopic expression in animals containing the uas- <dig> bp construct, irrespective of the driver line being employed . the possibility that these differences in core promoter activity might be due to the presence of cis-regulatory elements that drive salivary gland expression in the hsp <dig> core promoter is supported by the observation of gfp expression in third instar larvae salivary glands of the uas-gfp.s65t line in the absence of a gal <dig> driver . it is possible that the bhc4- <dig> core promoter does not contain cis-regulatory elements that drive salivary gland expression. alternatively, these cis-regulatory elements might also be present in the bhc4- <dig> core promoter but are specifically repressed in this tissue either due to the presence of tissue specific repressor or due to the absence of required co-activators. even though at present we are not able to distinguish between these possibilities, we propose that in some situations, when ectopic transactivation in the salivary glands constitutes a problem, the uas- <dig> bp lines generated in this work might be employed as a useful alternative to the widely used uas-gfp.s65t line.

CONCLUSIONS
in the absence of upstream activating sequences the  bhc4- <dig> core promoter drives low levels of expression throughout development in transgenic drosophila which is consistent with the function of a core promoter. when placed downstream of different regulatory elements from either b. hygida, d. melanogaster or yeast the bhc4- <dig> core promoter drives efficient regulated transcription in drosophila in distinct tissues throughout development. in the context of the gal4/uas system the bhc4- <dig> core promoter drives gene expression in the germline indicating that the presence of the sv <dig> sequence in the 3' utr of a uas construct does not preclude expression in the germline. in addition, the data derived from the functional characterization of the bhc4- <dig> promoter revealed that ectopic salivary gland expression in the gal4/uas system is not solely related to sequences present in the gal <dig> construct, but can also be affected by the use of different core promoter sequences in the uas construct. our results contribute to the functional characterization of the sciarid bhc4- <dig> core promoter that is an attractive alternative core promoter which might be employed in functional assays in insects.
