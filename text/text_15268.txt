BACKGROUND
carnitine is a metabolite which is best known for its role as a shuttling molecule for the transport of long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix where β-oxidation of fatty acids occurs  <cit> . besides this essential function in intermediary metabolism, extensive studies over the past years revealed that supplementation with carnitine has positive effects on performance characteristics  in livestock animals . in addition, convincing evidence has been provided that supplemental carnitine is useful for the treatment of metabolic disorders that are associated with an impaired glucose tolerance and/or insulin sensitivity like diabetes and insulin resistance both, in model animals and in humans reviewed in  <cit> . with regard to the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of carnitine it has been shown that carnitine supplementation alters the expression of a large number of genes involved in important metabolic pathways, like glucose uptake and oxidation, fatty acid oxidation and protein degradation as well as critical signalling pathways, like the igf-1/pi3k/akt pathway, in liver and/or skeletal muscle , which may explain at least partially the abovementioned effects in livestock and model animals and humans. however, the exact molecular mechanisms how supplemental carnitine alters gene expression in tissues are largely unknown.

increasing evidence suggests that micrornas , a class of small non-coding rna molecules , play an important role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and thereby influence a large number of physiological processes including differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and immune response, but also metabolic processes, like glucose and lipid metabolism . after maturation of the initially transcribed, so-called primary mirnas to the single-stranded mature form, mirnas are loaded into the rna-induced silencing complex , which subsequently interacts with the mirna recognition element  especially in the 3’ untranslated region  of the corresponding mrna  . the kind of binding and the involved proteins determine the further fate of the target mrnas, whose translation is either repressed or which are degraded  <cit> , thereby leading to down-regulation of gene expression. less commonly, mirnas can also up-regulate gene expression  <cit> . noteworthy, single mirnas can regulate the expression of hundreds of protein coding target mrnas and, conversely, the expression of a single gene can be regulated by multiple mirnas, indicating the complexity of mirna-mrna interrelationship and the great regulatory potential of mirnas  <cit> .

up to now, several experiments and clinical analysis have been published demonstrating an altered mirna expression profile and a modified phenotype due to an altered translation of target mrnas in response to different pathologies  or pharmacologic treatment  <cit> . in contrast, only few studies have evaluated the influence of dietary factors, such as high-cholesterol diet  <cit>  or conjugated linoleic acids  <cit> , on the mirna expression profile and its impact on gene expression in model or livestock animals. in a recent study, we could demonstrate that carnitine supplementation has beneficial effects in obese zucker rats  <cit>  - an established genetic model of obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. the beneficial effect of carnitine supplementation was evident by the observation that the obesity-induced impairment of carnitine status and metabolic disturbances  were significantly improved or even normalized  <cit> . the normalization of metabolic disturbances in obese zucker rats due to carnitine supplementation was accompanied by an up-regulation of genes involved in carnitine uptake, fatty acid transport and uptake, β-oxidation, glucose uptake and glycolysis, and a fiber switch from type ii to type i in skeletal muscle compared to non-supplemented zucker rats  <cit> . in light of the important role of mirnas for regulating gene expression, it is likely that at least some of these profound changes in gene expression in obese zucker rats due to carnitine supplementation were mediated by altering mirna expression in skeletal muscle. to our knowledge it has not been studied yet whether dietary carnitine influences mirna expression. therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that carnitine supplementation influences the mirna expression profile in skeletal muscle of obese zucker rats by using a mirna microarray.

we performed target prediction for the  <dig> significantly validated differentially expressed mirnas  to identify the influence of carnitine supplementation on potential target mrnas in skeletal muscle of obese zucker rats by combining the results from three online free available algorithms. according to this, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> target genes were identified for the  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated mirnas, respectively. data are shown in additional file 2: table s <dig>  to elucidate the biological functions of the predicted targets we carried out gene-term enrichment analysis using gene ontology  categories and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway analysis by using the david functional annotation chart tool separately for the targets identified for the  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated mirnas.gene-term enrichment analysis within go category “biological process” revealed that most target genes predicted from the  <dig> up-regulated mirnas were involved in protein localization, cell adhesion, biological adhesion, protein transport and establishment of protein localization . in contrast, most target genes predicted from the  <dig> down-regulated mirnas were involved in “biological processes” dealing with regulation of transcription, regulation of rna metabolic process, as well as regulation of transcription, dna dependent . within the go category “molecular function”, most of the target genes predicted from the  <dig> up-regulated mirnas were involved in enzyme- and rna-binding and in cytoskeletal protein binding , while most of the targets from the  <dig> down-regulated mirnas had functions in ion-, metal ion- and cation-binding, as well as nucleotide binding . regarding the go category “cell component”, the greatest number of targets predicted from the  <dig> up-regulated mirnas had functions associated with cell projection , whereas the functions of the targets predicted from the  <dig> down-regulated mirnas were associated with plasma membrane .figure  <dig>

discussion
this is the first study demonstrating the response of the mirna expression profile to dietary supplementation with carnitine. mirnas represent a relatively newly identified class of small non-coding rna molecules which play an important role for gene expression by mainly down-regulating the expression of protein-coding genes, and, consequently influence both, physiological and pathological processes. since the molecular mechanisms underlying changes in gene expression by carnitine supplementation in livestock and model animals are only poorly understood, the present study aimed to elucidate possible alterations in the mirna profile following dietary supplementation with carnitine. for mirna profiling, we used skeletal muscle samples from carnitine-supplemented and control  obese zucker rats, in which we have recently reported profound changes in the expression of genes involved in important metabolic pathways, like glucose and fatty acid metabolism and protein degradation  <cit> . it is well known that the carnitine status in obese zucker rats and other models of genetic and diet-induced obesity is markedly impaired and as a consequence several metabolic disturbances are induced . in contrast, supplementation with carnitine improves carnitine status, which was also demonstrated in the present study, and reverses to a great part these metabolic disturbances, like elevated blood levels of triacylglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance . the key finding of the present study is that carnitine supplementation resulted in a profound change in the mirna expression profile in skeletal muscle of obese zucker rats suggesting a novel regulatory mechanism by which dietary carnitine alters gene expression and mediates at least some of its biological effects. according to our mirna microarray analysis, a total of  <dig> mirnas were identified to be differentially expressed,  <dig> being up-regulated and  <dig> being down-regulated, in skeletal muscle of the obese zucker rats in response to carnitine supplementation. in order to elucidate the functional implications of alterations in the mirna profile it is a widely accepted approach to identify the mirna target genes by employing specific bioinformatics tools. because one single mirna can regulate the expression of hundreds of target mrnas, while one gene may be targeted by many mirnas, target prediction is usually carried out only in a small subset of the differentially expressed mirnas, typically in the most strongly differentially regulated mirnas. following this approach, we selected those mirnas, which were significantly differentially expressed between the two groups at a log <dig> ratio of ≥  <dig>  and ≤ − <dig>  according to microarray analysis and according to qrt-pcr, resulting in  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated mirnas, respectively. the subsequent in silico-target mrna prediction revealed  <dig> and  <dig> target genes for the  <dig> up-regulated and the  <dig> down-regulated mirnas, respectively. due to the limited conclusiveness of in silico-predictions, we determined mrna levels of one individual target gene for each of the carnitine-regulated mirnas using qrt-pcr in order to provide some proof of concept that predicted targets are indeed regulated in the expected direction in vivo. according to this, we observed that the majority of predicted target mrnas of the differentially regulated mirnas were regulated by carnitine in the opposite direction indicating that the predictions from in silico-analysis are reliable at least in some instances. one of the predicted mirna-mrna interactions, which could be confirmed in vivo, concerns the insulin-like growth factor - <dig>  igf- <dig> is a known target of the down-regulated mir-466b-1-3p and has been demonstrated to be up-regulated by carnitine in the present study but also in previous studies  <cit> . in order to strengthen the biological relevance of mirna-mrna interactions for regulating gene expression by carnitine in the case of igf- <dig>  we also determined protein levels of igf- <dig>  in line with the elevated mrna level of igf- <dig> in skeletal muscle, we also observed increased protein levels of igf- <dig> in skeletal muscle of rats of the carnitine group. this suggests that the elevated mrna level of igf- <dig> is a result of a decreased repressive activity of the down-regulated mir-466b-1-3p and that mirna-mrna interactions indeed play a significant role in mediating biological effects of carnitine. one important reason that might explain that the predictions of target mrnas for differentially regulated mirnas are not reliable in all instances is that one gene is normally subject to regulation by a cluster of mirnas, from which certain mirnas can be regulated in the opposite direction. another reason might be that the carnitine-mediated change in the expression of certain mirnas was not strong enough to induce a significant change in the expression of the targeted mrnas. moreover, post-transcriptional modifications by carnitine might also be responsible for the observation that predicted mirna-mrna interactions are not visible in vivo. finally, we carried out gene-term enrichment analysis within the three go categories and the kegg pathway database using david software, separately for the targets identified from the prediction of the  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated mirnas in order to identify biological functions of the predicted targets.

noteworthy, gene-term enrichment analysis of the targets predicted from the differentially regulated mirnas revealed that carnitine supplementation regulates mirnas that target a large set of genes involved in enzyme- and rna-binding, regulation of transcription, regulation of transcription-dna dependent, regulation of rna metabolic process, and nucleotide-binding. this clearly indicates that carnitine supplementation regulates many genes which are involved in controlling gene expression and that gene regulation by carnitine supplementation is more complex due to mirna-mrna interactions than previously thought. amongst the predicted target mrnas of the regulated mirnas we found about  <dig> mrnas encoding transcription factors, which were classified according to their function into general and specific transcription factors . we found that the main part belonged to the class specific transcription factors, like atf <dig>  bcl <dig>  bcor, bhlhe <dig>  bhlhe <dig>  crem, e2f <dig>  elk <dig>  hbp <dig>  hivep <dig>  irf <dig>  jun, klf <dig>  mef2c and many others. these specific transcription factors usually bind upstream of the initiation site to specific recognition sequences of the regulated gene to stimulate or repress its transcription. although it is difficult to directly relate the functions of most these specific transcription factors to recently observed carnitine effects in skeletal muscle, it is likely that carnitine mediates at least some of its effects on gene expression through regulating transcription factor activities by altering mirna expression. the observation that the minor part of the transcription factors targeted by the carnitine-regulated mirnas were general transcription factors, like gtf2b, gtf2i, hmgb <dig>  med <dig>  med <dig>  and paf <dig>  does not exclude a significant involvement in inducing carnitine effects in skeletal muscle  <cit> , because general transcription factors are essential for gene transcription to occur due to their obligatory role in transcription initiation by rna polymerase ii. analysis of the involvement of the predicted target genes in specific kegg pathways showed that particularly genes playing roles in signal transduction pathways, like the wnt signalling pathway , long-term depression , and protein-degrading pathways, like ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis , are targeted by the mirnas regulated by carnitine supplementation. regulation of mirnas targeting genes belonging to ubiqutin-mediated proteolysis may provide a plausible explanation for our recent observations in rats and pigs that carnitine supplementation down-regulates key genes involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in skeletal muscle . ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis within proteasomes is the most important protein degradation pathway in tissues in general, and particularly responsible for the degradation of myofibrillar proteins in skeletal muscle which make up about 60% of total muscle proteins. thus, the observation that carnitine supplementation reduces muscle wasting in a rat model of cancer cachexia  <cit> , which is characterized by an increased activity of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, is largely explained by inhibition of this pathway. inhibition of this pathway by carnitine supplementation is probably mediated by increasing plasma concentrations of igf- <dig>  which has been observed in several species including humans, pigs, rats and chickens . ifg- <dig> is an important negative regulator of this protein degrading pathway and this effect is mediated by an activation of the pi3/akt signalling pathway leading to inactivation of foxo transcription factors and thereby inhibition of the ubiquitin-ligating e <dig> ligases  <cit> . recently, we have indeed observed that carnitine supplementation activates the igf-1/pi3k/akt signalling pathway, inactivates foxos, reduces expression of e <dig> ligases and decreases the amount of ubiquitinated proteins which are targeted for degradation via the proteasome  <cit> . moreover, since igf- <dig> has also prominent functions in cell proliferation and differentiation it was not surprising that enrichment analysis identified igf- <dig> as one gene involved in the kegg pathways “pathways in cancer” but also in “long-term depression”, that was targeted by the mirnas down-regulated by carnitine supplementation. thus, our observations indicate that the recently observed increases in mrna and/or protein levels of igf- <dig> following carnitine supplementation is mediated at the level of mirna-mrna interactions.

the large number of target genes  predicted from the most strongly regulated mirnas and the other not explicitly mentioned data from gene-term enrichment analysis for the targets identified shows that carnitine supplementation may cause several other biological effects than up-regulation of igf- <dig> or inhibition of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis via mirna-mrna interactions. however, the biological implications of most of the observed carnitine-mediated changes in the mirna expression profile and its impact on specific metabolic and signalling pathways and whole metabolism cannot be resolved with certainty using biostatistics tools alone, because the prediction of target genes from differentially expressed mirnas is only an in silico-approach and, thus, has clear limitations. therefore, time-consuming experimental studies with cultured muscle cells, in which the effect of carnitine in the presence of mirna-specific inhibitors or during over-expression or knockdown of specific mirnas on target gene expression is studied, are necessary in the future to validate at least some of the carnitine-mediated mirna-mrna interactions. given that most of the detectable mirnas  were regulated by carnitine, it would be interesting to investigate in a future time-course experiment whether there are early and late responding mirnas which behave differently to carnitine supplementation.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study clearly shows for the first time that a large set of mirnas in skeletal muscle of obese zucker rats are responsive to carnitine supplementation suggesting a novel mechanism through which carnitine exerts its multiple effects on gene expression. using biostatistics tools at least some of the recently reported effects of carnitine supplementation on gene expression  could be demonstrated to be likely mediated via mirna-mrna interactions. although the biological implications of most of the observed carnitine-mediated changes in the mirna expression profile cannot be predicted using this biostatistics approach alone and experimental validations of mirna-mrna interactions are necessary, our results indicate that carnitine supplementation exerts several other biological effects through altering the expression of mirnas.
