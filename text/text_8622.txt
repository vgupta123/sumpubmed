BACKGROUND
conditional knockout mice are typically generated by insertion of two loxp sites flanking an exon that is critical for gene function. crossing these mice to mice that express the cre recombinase in a tissue-specific or inducible manner leads to deletion of the loxp-flanked dna segment  <cit> . the classical approach of genetic engineering to generate targeting vectors for conditional alleles can be quite laborious since homology arms and loxp-flanked selection cassettes need to be combined using suitable restriction sites. the development of phage-based recombineering systems which utilize homologous recombination in e. coli have facilitated the generation of suitable targeting vectors . in addition, the recombineering technology allows the generation of large targeting vectors with the possibility to introduce loxp sites that are separated by several kb of genomic sequence by a single targeting event in es cells  <cit> . here, we modified previously described tools to generate il-4/il- <dig> double knockout mice. we used a new strategy which facilitates the identification of correctly targeted conditional alleles by culturing es cells in replicate plates after cre-mediated deletion of a loxp-flanked resistance cassette.

RESULTS
we generated conditional il-4/il- <dig> double knockout mice with a single targeting vector that introduced two loxp sites separated by  <dig> kb of genomic sequence. we used two different selection cassettes with dual pro- and eukaryotic promoters that allowed selection in e. coli and subsequently in es cells.

first, we retrieved a  <dig>  kb segment of genomic sequence from an il-4/il- <dig> containing bac clone into the low copy plasmid pbr <dig> by gap repair recombineering  <cit> . fragments of up to  <dig> kb can be subcloned into pbr <dig>  <cit> . at least three reasons argue for subcloning genomic segments from bac clones. firstly, the retrieved genomic segments are easier to handle than bacs which grow at only one copy per cell. secondly, bac backbones contain a loxp site which should be removed from the targeting vector. finally, identification of correct targeting events by southern blot analysis requires that the homology arms flanking the selection cassettes are well defined and not too large.

the retrieval vector was constructed by cloning pcr products of about  <dig> bp which were homologous to sequences upstream of il- <dig> and downstream of il- <dig>  respectively, into pbr <dig> followed by the insertion of a diphtheria toxin a  expression cassette to enable counter selection against random integration in es cells. although dta could be problematic due to early extra-chromosomal expression before integration of the targeting vector, it has been used successfully in the past  <cit> . the il-4/il- <dig> encoding bac clone was transfected into dy <dig> cells, a previously described cell line which was engineered to contain a heat-inducible defective λ prophage encoding the red genes that are required for homologous recombination and gap-repair  <cit> . after the red genes had been induced by temperature shift the cells were transformed with the linearized retrieval vector and selected on lb-amp plates. next, two mini-targeting vectors  were generated to introduce loxp sites into the retrieved dna segment. the mtvs were constructed in pbluescript by one-step 4-piece ligation of two 350– <dig> bp homology arms together with either a loxp-flanked blasticidin resistance  cassette  which was generated by exchange of the neomycin/kanamycin resistance cassette  in the plasmid pl <dig>  <cit>  or a frt-frt/loxp flanked neor cassette  derived from plasmid pl <dig>  <cit> . the homology arms were designed to target the second intron of il- <dig>  or a segment downstream of il- <dig> outside known regulatory sequences , respectively. the targeting sites of both mtvs are separated by  <dig> kb of genomic sequence. heat-induced dy <dig> cells containing the retrieved dna segment were transformed sequentially with mtvs which had been excised from the pbluescript vector backbone to generate the final targeting vector . transformed dy <dig> cells were grown on kanamycin and blasticidin containing lb plates and correct integration of the mtvs was determined by pcr. one clone was picked and expanded in  <dig> ml liquid culture from which the targeting vector was isolated, cut with not i and purified using phenol/chloroform extraction. in the next step, we transfected  <dig> μg of the linearized targeting vector into es cells which were then grown in medium containing g <dig> and blasticidin.  <dig> es cell clones were analyzed by southern blot to determine correct integration into the genome.  <dig> clones  showed homologous recombination of both selection cassettes.  <dig> clones  had only integrated the 3' targeting site and  <dig> clones  had only integrated the 5' targeting site. this demonstrates that the frequency of correct targeting is relatively high . however, it also indicates that the long distance between the targeting sites can lead to loss and unspecific integration of one or the other selection cassette in a significant number of clones. comparable targeting frequencies  were reported for a shaved bac clone which contained hygromycin and neomycin resistance cassettes separated by  <dig> kb  <cit> .

in the next step we removed the bsdr cassette by transfection of es cells with a cre-recombinase encoding expression plasmid. since  <dig> loxp sites are still present in the targeted allele it is possible that  <dig> different recombination events occur . the desired recombination event should only remove the bsdr cassette  whereas both other recombinations would also delete the neor cassette. we could therefore distinguish between correctly and incorrectly recombined alleles by culturing es cells in replicate wells containing either g <dig> alone or g <dig> plus blasticidin. cells that survived in g <dig> but died in g <dig> plus blasticidin were expected to have undergone the correct recombination event. one es cell clone that had been targeted correctly during the first round of selection was transfected with a cre expression plasmid and grown for  <dig> days in g <dig>  then,  <dig> colonies were picked and further cultured in replicate wells containing either g <dig> or both g <dig> and blasticidin.  <dig> subclones  did not grow under blasticidin selection indicating loss of the bsdr cassette. southern blot analysis of subclones revealed that all  <dig> subclones showed the correct recombination. therefore, the strategy of using two different selection cassettes and culturing es cells in replicate wells after cre-mediated deletion of one selection cassette proved to be highly efficient and reduces the number of clones that need to be re-screened by southern blot. an alternative strategy for selection-based identification of correctly removed resistance cassettes would be to use a loxp-flanked positive/negative selection cassette  instead of the loxp-flanked bsdr cassette. culturing es cells in ganciclovir-containing medium after cre-transfection would then delete all subclones that retained the hygr/tk cassette. however, this selection strategy was often inefficient in the past due to low expression of thymidin-kinase which resulted in many false-positive subclones that survived the selection  <cit> . in addition, adverse effect of ganciclovir on es cell cultures have been described  <cit> .

es cells were injected into c57bl/ <dig> blastocysts to generate chimeras. after germline transmission of the targeted allele had been confirmed by pcr, we crossed the mice to flpe deleter mice to delete the neor cassette  <cit> . the final targeted allele  contains a single loxp site in the second intron of il- <dig> and a frt/loxp site downstream of il- <dig> . to determine the efficiency and specificity of cre-mediated deletion of the  <dig> kb intergenic region, we crossed 4–13f/+ mice to cd4-cre mice  <cit>  on il-4/il- <dig> knockout background   <cit> . rt-pcr analysis of th2-polarized cd <dig> t cells or bone marrow derived mast cells of 4–13f/- or cd4-cre/4–13f/- mice revealed that the targeted allele was efficiently recombined in cd <dig> t cells  but not in mast cells . the immune response of conditional il-4/il- <dig> knockout mice upon infection with helminth parasites will be described elsewhere . the recombination occurred with a remarkably high efficiency despite the relatively long distance between both loxp sites . high recombination efficiencies are obviously essential for conditional knock-out alleles. as one might expect, the efficiency generally drops with the distance between the two loxp sites. however, a segment of  <dig> mb on mouse chromosome  <dig> could still be recombined with an efficiency of 11%  <cit> . for even larger segments it has been shown that the logarithm of the recombination efficiency is inversely proportional to the distance between the loxp sites  <cit> . furthermore, inter-chromosomal recombinations have been generated using the cre/loxp system although the efficiency was very low   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we describe a new strategy to facilitate the identification of es cells with correctly recombined conditional alleles. this strategy is based on the use of two different loxp-loxp or frt-frt/loxp flanked selection cassettes so that es cells could be cultured in replicate plates after cre-mediated removal of the first selection cassette. southern blot analysis of es cells that remained resistant to one but lost resistance to the other antibiotic confirmed the correct recombination event. therefore, this strategy appears very useful for rapid identification of es cell clones containing the desired allele before blastocyst injection.
