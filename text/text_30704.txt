BACKGROUND
the pax <dig> gene encodes for a transcription factor that has been shown to play a pivotal role in the development of epithelial organ structures  <cit> . expression of cre-recombinase driven by the promoter of pax <dig> has been shown in both kidney epithelia as well as the thyroid gland. pax <dig> itself is a transcription factor important in embryogenesis of the thyroid, müllerian, and renal/upper urinary tracts. consequently, a pax8cre mouse line is the perfect tool to address the importance of micrornas  in the development and maintenance of two important epithelial organs—thyroid gland and kidney—through targeted ablation of mirna biogenesis.

regulation of gene transcriptional networks by small non-coding rnas  has been shown to play a crucial role in epithelial morphogenesis and the development and physiology of epithelial organs. hence, it is not surprising that loss of micrornas through conditional knockout of dicer in the thyroid gland using the pax8cre mouse line resulted in the loss of thyroidal hormone production and death soon after weaning  <cit> . however, these studies left some major questions unanswered. first, dicer is not only involved in mirna biogenesis, but also plays a role in other cellular processes such as genomic dna fragmentation during apoptosis, the processing of endogenous sirna and the detoxification of repeat elements . furthermore dicer has recently been shown to bind to other rna classes such as trnas, snornas, mrnas and promoter rnas  <cit> . in this context dicer binding does not necessarily involve cleavage but can also primarily impact on rna-stability and recruitment of rna molecules to p-granules. one way to confirm a phenotype observed in dicer knockout animals to be truly dependent on mirnas is confirmation of the phenotype knocking out a different component of the mirna biogenesis machinery such as dgcr <dig>  <cit> . dgcr <dig> is the interaction partner of the rnase  <dig> drosha and as such essential to the maturation of most mirnas. this has been done successfully before, e.g. in studies addressing the role of mirnas in skin development or podocyte maintenance  <cit> . dgcr <dig> itself has a number of functions independent from mirna biogenesis as well  <cit> . however, an equal or at least highly similar phenotype between dicer and dgcr <dig> loss of function models would strongly reinforce the hypothesis of the phenotype to be mirna-dependent since mirna biogenesis is the only overlapping function between these two proteins known so far.

as to the kidney the specified anatomy of its epithelial composition adds another layer of complexity. in humans each kidney consists of about one million functional units—so called nephrons—that are made up by several specified segments each composed of a number of specialized epithelial cell types. filtration of the blood occurs in the glomerulus thereby producing the primary urine. the urine is then processed in the tubulus system that can again be divided into several segments each fulfilling a different subset of functions regarding reabsorption and excretion of fluid and electrolytes. these differences in the properties of the tubulus cells along the nephron explain the distinct phenotypes that were described so far in regard to interference with mirna processing by deleting dicer conditionally in different segments of the tubulus system ranging from no obvious defects at all to rapid end-stage renal disease. for example, dicer was deleted from the entire developing nephron lineage , proximal tubulus , in the distal tubulus, collecting duct and developing ureteric bud  or wolffian duct, ureter, collecting duct and ureteric bud  .

RESULTS
to analyse the role of mirnas in the development and maintenance of two epithelial organs—thyroid gland and kidney—and to understand to which extent the phenotype observed in dicer-pax8cre knockout mice is indeed due to a lack of mirnas we generated dgcr8-pax8cre knockout mice .

dgcr8 fl/fl, pax8cre+ offspring was approximately born at the expected mendelian ratio . nonetheless, starting already during the weaning period these mice were smaller and weighing showed a significantly decreased body weight in comparison to littermate controls . analysis of free thyroxine  revealed massive hypothyroidism in dgcr <dig> knockout mice since essentially almost no ft <dig> was detectable anymore . the thyroid glands of dgcr <dig> knockout mice were considerably smaller than the controls. the follicular architecture was almost destroyed, few follicular structures were present with variable diameter and irregular outlines .fig.  <dig>

dgcr <dig> knockout mice develop hypothyroidism as demonstrated by dramatically decreased ft <dig> levels in comparison to control littermates . d h&e staining of dgcr <dig> knockout thyroid glands reveals a severely disorganized follicular architecture 



molecular analysis of differentiation markers on knockout thyroid glands showed that the expression of the early differentiation markers pax <dig>  nkx <dig>  and foxe <dig> is retained in the residual follicular cells, as well as the expression of their target nis. conversely, the expression of another late differentiation marker—tg—resulted strongly reduced in the residual follicles. no alterations in calcitonin secreting cells were observed . thus, dgcr <dig> knockout mice show functional defects partly similar to those from dicer knockout mice  <cit> . the main difference is that nis is still expressed in dgcr <dig> knockout mice, while being completely absent in dicer knockout animals.fig.  <dig> analysis of differentiation markers in dgcr8–pax8cre knockout thyroid glands. immunohistochemistry of thyroid differentiation markers show a strong reduction of tg expression. pax <dig>  nkx <dig>  and foxe <dig> expression levels are unaffected in the residual follicular cells, as well as the expression of their target nis. no alteration in calcitonin cells was observed. 



this severe hypothyroidism would generally be enough to explain the lethality of loss of micrornas in the thyroid gland. however, as mentioned above previous studies showed that death in mice with a pax8cre mediated loss of dicer in the thyroid gland could not be prevented by thyroxin substitution. this points to an additional mechanism leading to premature death in pax8cre mediated coditional loss of mirnas  <cit> .

beside the thyroid gland it is known that pax <dig> is also expressed in the kidney, especially in almost all segments of the kidney tubulus system  <cit> .

kidneys of the dgcr <dig> knockout mice were smaller and weighed less than the control kidneys but there was no significant difference in the kidney/body weight ratio. serum urea and serum creatinine levels were substantially increased in dgcr8–pax8cre knockout mice showing that these mice develop end-stage renal disease at the age of 4–6 weeks . quantitative pcr analysis confirmed the knockout of dgcr <dig> in the kidney .fig.  <dig>

in line with this finding, histological analysis of the knockout kidneys revealed severe alterations in all parts of the tubulus system. we could detect hydronephrosis, proximal and distal tubular cysts, glomerular cysts and activated bowman´s epithelium. also a strongly decreased parenchymal mass was detectable. .fig.  <dig>

since dgcr <dig> is one of the key components of efficent mirna biogenesis we analysed the abundance of several mirnas that have been reported to be enriched in kidney epithelial cells  <cit> . the expression of mir- <dig>  mir-200b and mir- <dig> was significantly decreased in kidneys of dgcr <dig> knockout mice .fig.  <dig> decreased expression of kidney specific mirnas. using qpcr the expression of several mirnas was analysed. in line with a key role of dgcr <dig> in mirna processing, the kidney epithelial cell enriched mirnas mir- <dig>  mir-200b and mir- <dig> are strongly downregulated. snorna- <dig> served as endogenous control 



to further elucidate the consequences of loss of dgcr <dig> to cellular biology in the kidney, we performed tunel assays. these stainings revealed a massive induction of apoptosis in all segments of the kidney , suggesting that dgcr <dig> dependent mirnas are essential for the development and maintenance of a functional kidney tubulus system. interestingly staining for the proliferation marker ki- <dig> showed that beside apoptosis proliferation is also increased in the tubulus system, especially in the cortical region of dgcr <dig> knockout mice pointing towards a general increase in cellular turnover . staining of thyroid gland tissue revealed that this increase of apoptosis  on the one hand and proliferation  on the other hand is not limited to the kidney but a general finding in the affected epithelial tissue of dgcr8-pax8cre knockout mice .fig.  <dig>

discussion
we used the pax8cre-allele to induce a conditional knockout of dgcr <dig>  the consequential loss of mirnas in epithelial cells of the kidney and thyroid gland strongly perturbed the epithelial architecture of these organs leading to massive thyroid hypoplasia and dysplastic kidneys. on the functional side this phenotype is accompanied by not only severe hypothyroidism but also end-stage renal disease leading to premature death of the affected mice. our mouse model highlights the importance of micrornas to development and function of two relevant epithelial organs. just like for most organs the general role of micrornas in thyroid homeostasis and development had been addressed using a conditional knockout of dicer  <cit> . here we show that knockout of dgcr <dig> leads to a similar phenotype of severe hypothyroidism due to thyroid hypoplasia confirming the importance of mirnas for thyroid development and maintenance. nonetheless we also observed some structural and molecular differences between pax8cre mediated loss of dicer and dgcr <dig>  although the general organization of the thyroid gland of dgcr <dig> knockout mice is severely altered, some structures resembling functional follicles are still present, while dicer knockout mice at the same age do not show any follicular structure. residual follicles in dgcr <dig> knockout mice show expression of foxe <dig> and pax <dig> transcription factors, however thyroglobulin is absent from lumina showing instead strong intracellular positivity in some cells. moreover, dgcr <dig> knockout mice still express the nis iodide symporter, that resulted absent in dicer knockout thyroids. we can thus speculate that, differently to what observed in dicer knockout mice, the hypothyroidism observed in dgcr <dig> knockout mice does not depend on a block of differentiation, as the differentiation markers tg and nis are expressed in the residual follicles. the inability of thyroid epithelial cells to form functional follicles could be instead due to defects in cell polarization, as suggested by the intracellular retention of tg.

whether the differences observed between these mouse models regarding the expression of thyroid differentiation markers are due to specific functions of the small number of micrornas the processing of which depends only on either dicer or dgcr <dig> or is a consequence of entirely mirna-independent functions of these proteins remains elusive as of now. mechanistically seen this will be a highly interesting topic for further research.

the renal phenotype observed provides a good explanation why conditional pax8credicer knockout mice could not be rescued by substitution of thyroxin, which would generally rescue the loss of thyroid function  <cit> . concomitant end-stage renal failure would inevitably lead to death in this setting. during preparation of this manuscript iervolino et al. published the renal phenotype of pax8cre mediated knockout of dicer, which—being largely in line with our findings—again strengthens our view that the phenotype observed is induced by the loss of micrornas  <cit> . renal hypoplasia and hydronephrosis in our mice is in line with the findings observed before regarding dicer knockout using a number of different cre-alleles  <cit> . our findings in respect of cell death and proliferation allow for the hypothesis that this perturbed balance is the cell biological correlate of organ dysfunction upon global loss of micrornas. this cell biological consequence of the loss of mirnas is not only supported by other studies in different tissues . we also found this phenotype in a kspcre mediated dgcr <dig> knockout model  <cit> . as expected taking into account the complex epithelial organization of the kidney described above these mice show a phenotype distinct from the renal disease described here with much more pronounced hydronephrosis.

it will now be an exciting endeavor to clarify whether the dysregulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis is mediated by single mirna sequences or are rather a consequence of the tremendous effects of a global loss of mirna-mediated regulatory processes.

CONCLUSIONS
mirnas are important regulators of key processes on a cellular, tissue and organismal level. here we show, that disruption of the mirna processing machinery using a dgcr <dig> dependent knockout in pax <dig> expressing cells leads to a severe phenotpye in two epithelial organs that rely on the pax <dig> transcription factor during its development. the knockout mice develop severe hypothyroidism due to thyroid gland hypoplasia and develop end stage renal disease with hydronephrosis, cystic kidney disease and hypoplastic kidneys. consequently this study adds to the evidence of mirnas being crucial to the normal function of pax8-expressing epithelial cells. furthermore the end-stage renal disease observed provides an explanation why thyroid hormone substitution did not rescue mice with a pax8cre driven conditional knockout of dicer in previous studies.
