BACKGROUND
the defensin gene locus at chromosome 8p <dig>  is one of the most copy number  variable regions of the human genome  <cit> . it harbors genes for different alpha- and ß-defensins, antimicrobial and cytotoxic peptides involved in the orchestrated defense of infection and cancer  <cit> . both gene dosage  and sequence variation  affect expression and may influence physiological and pathogenic processes. hence, determining both types of variants is a prerequisite to further correlate genetic architecture and phenotype  <cit> .

for such targets, assessment of snps and multisite variations  - comprehensively called single nucleotide variations  - simultaneously with reliable cn estimation is extraordinarily challenging. pcr based snv assessment combined with cn estimation both by traditional sanger and next-generation sequencing  is feasible  <cit>  but covers only tiny parts of the region consisting of two clusters  spanning ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> kb, respectively.

recently, ngs methods have allowed re-sequencing of complete individual human genomes  <cit> . on the other hand, costs are still too high for sequencing entire genomes when only cnv regions of several hundred kb are of interest.

a way to overcome this constriction may be sequence capture methods allowing the enrichment of selected target regions over 1000-fold above their normal fraction in the genome  <cit> . these techniques are either based on arrays  <cit>  or in-solution enrichments  <cit> .

as a proof of principle and to comprehensively assess the sequence variability in the 8p <dig> def region of human genomes with simultaneous estimation of defb cluster cns, we enriched the def regions and  <dig> different bona fide single copy control regions  from two cell-line derived individual dnas by nimblegen sequence capture arrays and sequenced by 454/roche. the 454/roche technology was chosen as it provides the longest sequence reads among available ngs approaches which in turn allowed inference of cns from haplotype ratios  <cit>  simultaneously with the variability assessment.

methods
to investigate a "simple" as well as a "complex" case in terms of defb sequence variability we selected the samples na <dig> and na <dig>  harboring  <dig> and  <dig> defb copies per diploid genome, respectively, as multiply determined by different methods  <cit> . both genomes were genotyped by the international hapmap project  <cit> , the corresponding cell lines were derived from male individuals of european origin and are publicly available. next generation sequencing of these dna samples was done in the framework of the  <dig> genomes project  in the low coverage group by the solexa/illumina and abi/solid platforms resulting in  <dig> gb  and  <dig> gb  raw data, respectively.

cell lines and dnas
b-lymphocyte, ebv transformed cell lines gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  were purchased from the coriell cell depository . both cell lines are part of the hapmap project hapmappt <dig> . cell lines were cultured in rpmi <dig> with gibco glutamax™  with 10% fetal bovine serum "gold"  and  <dig> % penstrep  in  <dig> ml and  <dig> ml bd falcon™ flasks at 37°c and 5% co <dig> in a total amount of  <dig> ml and  <dig> ml, respectively. cells were grown to a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml and split in a ratio of 1: <dig>  from the cell lines, dnas na <dig> and na <dig> were isolated using the qiaamp dna-blood mini kit .

sequence capture enrichments
total amounts of  <dig> ug of dna na <dig>  and  <dig> ug of dna na <dig> , both with a260/a <dig> ≥ <dig>  and a260/a230≥ <dig>   were enriched using a customer designed 385k 1-plex sequence capture array following the manufacturer's instructions . target regions, captured regions and chromosomal positions are listed in additional file  <dig> 

target enrichment
dna was isolated from the cell lines and enriched on a customized 385k sequence capture array, designed and produced by nimblegen . on the array,  <dig> kb  of the  <dig> kb target comprised by defa , defb  and  <dig> ctrl regions  were tiled by probes . within two of these ctrl genes , probe hybridization sites were previously defined for multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification  and used for calibration of defb cn estimation  <cit> .

 <dig> sequencing
shotgun sequencing libraries were prepared by the gs titanium library preparation kit following the manufacturer's instructions . the single-stranded libraries were quantified by a qpcr assay  <cit>  and processed utilizing the gs titanium empcr and xlr70t sequencing kit  according to the manufacturer's instructions. sequencing was performed by three runs on a half  <dig> ×  <dig> picotiter plate each  and one run on a complete  <dig> ×  <dig> picotiter plate , respectively. sequencing of the enriched dna by gs flx  yielded ~ <dig> mb  and ~ <dig> mb  of raw sequence data. the raw sequence data outputs  are listed in additional file  <dig>  all  <dig> sequences mapping to the ctrl, defa and defb target regions were deposited at the ncbi short read archive  under the accession number sra <dig> 

sequence analysis
the  <dig> reads in the sff files from na <dig> and na <dig> were independently mapped by the gs reference mapper against the concatenated target regions as backbone with a minimum initial match of 92% and a minimal initial mapping length of  <dig> bp . the fully and uniquely mapping sequences were then mapped again to the human genome  masked for all except the target regions . to distinguish between known and putative novel snvs the information about known snp positions for the reference sequence  were used. the snvs classified as putative novel by these information were re-validated by alignment against the human reference snp sequence data  using blat  <cit> . the blat output was analyzed by an inhouse perl script.

error model
sequencing errors that accumulate at particular positions may falsely indicate novel alleles. hapmap snps homozygous for the variant allele of the ctrl and defa regions  were used to determine the average per-site error frequency in the aligned reads as  <dig> %. a binomial distribution was then used to model the false positive rate in snp/snv detection, given the average error frequency  and local sequencing depth . the model was used to evaluate all putative allele calls reported by hcdiff by calculating the posterior probability of observing d identical deviations just as a result of error: . a threshold of p = 10- <dig> was applied to remove likely false positives from the output of hcdiff.

snv verification by pcr/cloning/sanger sequencing
snv verification was performed using the cell line derived dna without sequence capture enrichment. pcr primers are listed in additional file  <dig>  pcr products were either directly sequenced using dye terminator chemistry  or after cloning into pcr <dig>  topo vector .

haplotyping and cn estimations
for haplotyping, all sequences covering the haplotyping candidate regions  were extracted and re-assembled in gap <dig> . the gap <dig> assemblies were manually inspected at the polymorphic positions and haplotypes were inferred by a proprietary script. cn estimations were done as previously described  <cit>  by counting all sequences representing the same haplotype and calculating the ratio of read numbers.

RESULTS
identification of high confidence differences 
the raw data obtained from  <dig> sequencing of the target enriched dna  were subjected to an analysis and filter process depicted in figure  <dig>  a first filtering was done by mapping the raw data against the target regions. the fractions of fully and uniquely mapping reads were 47% and 51% for na <dig> and na <dig> and 91% and 93% of the target regions were covered by at least  <dig> sequences, respectively. in relation to  <dig> kb target and  <dig> gb human genome, the enrichment rates were ~470x and ~630x. the corresponding sequencing depths for ctrl, defa, and defb were 60x, 56x, 45x for na <dig> and 44x, 37x, 100x for na <dig>  respectively. the target filtered sequences were then mapped by the reference mapper  against the human genome  in order to assign chromosomal positions and to provide high confidence differences  to the reference. these differences included single nucleotide variations , insertions/deletions  and complex nucleotide exchanges. we further focused on snvs by discarding indels and complex exchanges from the hcdiffs list. this resulted in  <dig>  and  <dig>  hcdiffs for the ctrl, defa and defb regions of na <dig> and na <dig>  respectively.

evaluation of sensitivity, specificity and false discovery rate by comparison to hapmap snps
to estimate the accuracy of the snv identification and to define reliable quality filter settings for the defb analyses, we compared the hcdiff data of the single-copy ctrl and defa regions with snp data from the international hapmap project . we categorized the  <dig>  and  <dig>  hcdiffs for na <dig> and na <dig>  respectively, by their variant's allele frequencies . according to the reference mapper software, vafs for hcdiffs by definition range between 10% and 100%. we therefore defined the categories as homozygous for the reference allele , heterozygous  and homozygous for the variant  . the corresponding hapmap data  for ctrl and defa of na <dig> and na <dig>  comprised  <dig>  and  <dig>  genotypes, respectively. comparing the hapmap data with our hcdiffs, we estimate that our approach has equal sensitivity and specificity for the identification of hethcdiffs  and homvarhcdiffs  for bona fide single-copy loci with  <dig> copies per diploid genome .

the seqcap hcdiffs were categorized according to the variant's allele frequency  with the human genome sequence  as reference allele: homozygous for reference ; heterozygous ; homozygous for variant .

in addition, we characterized the false discovery rate in more detail. it is caused by sequencing errors that accumulate at particular positions and falsely indicate novel alleles. using  <dig> hapmap snps of the ctrl and defa regions of na <dig> which are homozygous for the variant allele we determined the average per-site error frequency in the alignment as  <dig> %. this rate reflects the combined errors from sequencing and read mapping. a binomial distribution was then used to model the false positive rate in hcdiff detection, given the average error frequency  and local sequencing depth  . vaf distributions of sequenced hapmap sites and vaf distributions predicted by this binomial model showed good agreement . consequently, this model was used to assign the posterior error probability p to each putative allele call reported by hcdiff, and this was used for quality estimation of hcdiffs .

snv assessment by filtering of hcdiffs
to obtain a reliable set of snvs, the identified hcdiffs were successively subjected to two filter steps. first, by comparison to the hg <dig> reference, we re-checked our target regions for parts with more paralogs than annotated in the known copy number variable defa and defb regions at 8p <dig> . we identified a  <dig> kb region in the defb cluster which overlaps an  <dig> kb low copy repeat   <cit> . lcr iv has additional paralogs at chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  they are subjected to the enrichment together with the target regions due to sequence identities of up to 98% and hampered the snv identification in the defb region. consequently, we excluded all variations identified in this region, reducing the data set to  <dig>  and  <dig>  hcdiffs for na <dig> and na <dig>  respectively, corresponding to 62% and 68% of the primary amount .

then, as a sequence quality filtering, we applied our binomial distribution model  to the reduced set of hcdiffs. variants with probability values p > <dig> × 10- <dig>  were considered error-prone and discarded, finally resulting in  <dig>  and  <dig>  hcdiffs  for na <dig> and na <dig>  respectively .

when plotting the hcdiffs according to their vafs, the vaf distribution profile changes as a result of the filter process. for na <dig>  due to the copy number of  <dig> for all target regions, hcdiffs should be spread around 50% vaf  and near 100% . however, with the unfiltered hcdiffs, we observed a high amount of hcdiffs far below the expected peak at 50% vaf. in contrast, the plot of the filtered variations has exactly the anticipated pattern. analogously, the curve for na <dig> ctrl+defa  is changed after filtering, resulting in a shape similar to na <dig> . for na <dig> defb  the diagram reflects the different vafs from allele ratios of 1: <dig> to 6: <dig> .

we defined the set of  <dig>  and  <dig>  filtered hcdiffs as the final set of snvs which was sub-classified by region and presence or absence from the snp database . to distinguish between both categories we initially used the ucsc hg <dig> annotations and re-validated the variations classified as unknown by comparison to the more up-to-date dbsnp <dig> database . this revealed  <dig> known/ <dig> putative novel snvs in the ctrl regions, 604/ <dig> in defa and 560/ <dig> in defb of na <dig>  for na <dig>  595/ <dig> snvs in ctrl, 428/ <dig> in defa and 979/ <dig> in defb were identified.

similarly to the hapmap comparison  we further classified the snvs by vaf. for ctrl and defa in both samples as well as for defb in na <dig>  snvs with 25% ≤vaf ≤75% were regarded as heterozygous  and as homozygous for the variant  with 75% < vaf ≤100%. this revealed  <dig>  het and  <dig> homvar snvs  for na <dig> and  <dig> het  and  <dig> homvar  for na <dig>  for both samples, a fraction of ambiguous snvs with 10% ≤vaf <25% remained, encompassing only ~3% of all snvs, which can be regarded as measure of the false positive rate in the lower quarter of vaf. the snvs from na <dig> defb  were sub-classified by the number of copies deviating from the hg <dig> reference using the vaf ranges 10-24%/25-42%/43-58%/59-75%/76-92%/93-100%. this revealed  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> snvs for the six classes from  <dig> out of  <dig> copies to  <dig> out of  <dig> copies .

we also checked the final snv sets for overlap between both dnas, resulting in  <dig> known/ <dig> putative novel unique snvs in the ctrl regions, 701/ <dig> in defa and  <dig> / <dig> in defb . a summary for the final snv sets is shown in figure  <dig>  all hcdiffs and snvs are listed in detail in additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

experimental validation of snv candidates
to test the reliability of snv identification by our pipeline we experimentally verified  <dig> hcdiffs from the ctrl, defa, and defb regions of na <dig>  all investigated hcdiffs are putative novel variations. the set comprised hcdiffs with sequencing depths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> reads and vafs between 13% and 97%.

the snv flanking regions were amplified from the total non-enriched dna na <dig> and the pcr products were sequenced by the sanger method. furthermore,  <dig> defa and  <dig> defb pcr products were also subcloned and the clones were sequenced. for  <dig> hcdiffs with vafs between 17% and 76%, the presence of two alleles could be confirmed. for  <dig> hcdiffs with 96% and 97% vaf, respectively, the variant allele was found exclusively. the remaining  <dig> hcdiff  with a sequence depth of  <dig> and 13%vaf was found homozygous for the hg <dig> reference allele in the sanger-sequenced pcr product as well as in  <dig> clones derived from it. hence,  <dig> hcdiffs out of  <dig>  were confirmed. for the hcdiffs which were additionally verified by cloning, the vaf values of cloning and  <dig> sequencing are in good agreement .

comparison of the hapmap with our na <dig> data revealed  <dig> discrepancies which can be divided in three groups:  heterozygous/homozygous for the variant ;  homozygous for the variant/heterozygous  and  homozygous for the reference/heterozygous . we verified  <dig> of these variations by pcr and sanger sequencing, confirming for  <dig> and  <dig> the sequence capture results or hapmap status, respectively. in addition to the  <dig> discrepancies,  <dig> hapmap snvs were not resolved by the sequence capture experiment due to low sequence depth, low quality or alignment errors .

haplotyping and cn estimations
with an average read length of > <dig> bp, in regions of high snv densities at least a certain amount of gs flx sequences should span two or more snvs positions, allowing the inference of haplotypes. furthermore, as previously shown  <cit> , copy numbers can be estimated from the ratio of sequences representing the distinct haplotypes.

for this purpose we have selected from our alignments  <dig> haplotyping candidate regions  within defb of na <dig> and na <dig>  altogether, the htcrs harbor  <dig> snvs and span  <dig> kb  with at least  <dig> snvs/kb . for the inference of haplotypes from htcrs we postulated a minimal number of  <dig> sequences per haplotype. consequently, haplotyping was done if the snv combination was covered by ≥ <dig> reads for na <dig>  and ≥ <dig> reads for na <dig> . in total,  <dig> snvs could be used to identify  <dig> haplotypes from combinations of  <dig> to  <dig> snv .

at the loci with  <dig> copies per diploid genome, the ratio of reads representing the same haplotype should be 1: <dig>  indeed, we found for na <dig> defb  <dig> snv combinations consisting of two haplotypes in a ratio of 172: <dig> reads . for na <dig> ctrl,  <dig> ×  <dig> haplotypes were inferred with a total read ratio of 104: <dig> .

in the defb region of na <dig> ,  <dig> cn estimations could be done from  <dig> different haplotypes , revealing between  <dig> and  <dig> copies per diploid genome with an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  

snvs in the putative defb <dig> promoter region
recently we have identified haplotypes in the putative defb <dig> promoter region  and have found an extraordinarily high density of ~ <dig> snvs per kb  <cit> . we therefore inspected the sequence alignments of na <dig> and na <dig> in this region . in total,  <dig> out of  <dig> snvs identified by groth et al. were also found to be heterozygous or homozygous for the variant in na <dig>  analogously, we identified  <dig> such positions in na <dig> of which  <dig> are identical in both dnas. thus, for  <dig> out of  <dig> snv positions  previously identified in  <dig> individuals, the variant alleles were also found in at least one of the two genomes of na <dig> and na <dig> .

two additional snvs were found to be polymorphic in na <dig>  one  showed 10%vaf, the second  27%vaf. in the same way as described above we also inferred haplotypes from the na <dig> putative defb <dig> promoter region .

discussion
cn polymorphisms are an experimental challenge with respect to their identification as well as for their genotyping in association or linkage studies  <cit> . disease association analyses in cn variable loci are therefore currently restricted to the determination of cns thereby often ignoring the variable sequence contents of the respective copies. the defensin locus on 8p <dig> is an extreme example of a large cn variable genomic locus . knowledge of the copies' variability is still fragmentary and we aimed with our study to describe it in more detail. the power of a combination of selective enrichment of target regions in the human genome and ngs has already been demonstrated  <cit> , but such an approach has not been applied to cn variable loci so far.

by our sequence capture experiments using two individual genomic dnas, the ctrl, defa and defb target regions with a total length of  <dig> mb were enriched 600fold above their normal fraction in the whole human genome. since this calculation is related to the entire target instead of the captured regions , the enrichment rate is rather underestimated and in every case higher than determined by qpcr in the course of the enrichment process . subsequent  <dig> sequencing of the enriched dnas and mapping the sequences to the human genome resulted in ctrl, defa and defb sequence depths of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  for na <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  for na <dig>  respectively. although the sequencing depth ratios ctrl:defa:defb are not exactly 1:1: <dig> for na <dig> and 1:1: <dig> for na <dig> as expected from the defb cns, the higher coverage of defb in na <dig> compared to na <dig> reflects the difference in defb cns between the two dnas and saturation of the array in case of high target region cns. furthermore, the ctrl:defa sequence depth ratio of ~1: <dig> for both dnas indicates the single copy status  of these regions.

quality estimation and filtering
assessment of known and putative novel single nucleotide variants  was performed on the base of the roche reference mapper software providing high confidence differences  including chromosomal positions, sequence depths, variant's allele frequencies and snp entry ids. comparison of the hcdiffs to hapmap data allowed the evaluation of the snv identification accuracy, revealing a false-positive call rate of  <dig> % per site. with sensitivities and specificities of ≥94% for the detection of heterozygote snvs and >98% for homozygote snvs we achieve similar values to those obtained by nimblegen whole exome capture arrays combined with illumina sequencing  <cit> .

the second filter step for the obtained hcdiffs used a binomial distribution based model to distinguish with a given probability between real snvs and nucleotide differences by pcr or sequencing errors. from the entire set of hcdiffs for na <dig> and na <dig>   <dig> % and  <dig> % have a probability value p >10- <dig>  respectively. there are, however, remarkable differences between the excluded and remaining hcdiffs of the first filter step. of the discarded variations from the segmentally duplicated region,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the hcdiffs have p-values > 10- <dig> in contrast to  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the retained ones. this suggests again that our filtering for hcdiffs in the segmentally duplicated defb region is reasonable.

with respect to the  <dig>  snvs identified in both dnas and the applied quality threshold of p ≤ 10- <dig> we expect 4- <dig> false positives which are sequencing artifacts. under more stringent conditions  we would exclude them which in turn remove another  <dig> potentially real snvs, thereof  <dig>  of the putative novel variations .

snv densities and validation of putative novel snvs
by our approach we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  snvs  in the ctrl, defa and defb regions for na <dig> and na <dig>  respectively, corresponding to a mean density of  <dig>  and  <dig>  snv/kb . however, the snv densities differ between the regions. with  <dig>  snv/kb for both dnas, the invariable single copy ctrl genes have the lowest densities while they are somewhat higher for the defa cluster with  <dig>  and  <dig>  snv/kb for na <dig> and na <dig>  respectively. the highest density of  <dig>  snv/kb was observed for the defb cluster of na <dig>  in contrast, mapping the identified defb snvs of na <dig> to  <dig> defb copies per haploid genome results in a density of  <dig>  snv/kb. these findings reflect either a higher relatedness of na <dig> defa/b to the reference sequence, or lower sensitivity of the snv detection in regions with high cn, or both. sensitivity problems are expected in particular for rare alleles in na <dig> defb  with an expected vaf of  <dig> % and an experimental vaf distribution between  <dig> and 25% which are selected against by our stringent filtering .

in both dna samples we have identified  <dig> putative novel snvs . their fraction with respect to all identified snvs ranges between 4% and 8% in the ctrl and defa regions but 15% and 17% in defb. we compared our putative novel snvs both with the most current dbsnp <dig> database  and the data from the  <dig> genomes project . the latter provided sequences for na <dig> and na <dig> corresponding to depths of ~8x and ~13x, respectively. out of our  <dig> putative novel snvs,  <dig> were meanwhile identified and submitted to dbsnp by the  <dig> genomes project and another  <dig> by other groups. in contrast,  <dig>  of our novel snvs identified by targeted analysis in just two genomes remained undetected by the significantly larger efforts of others. this underlines the efficiency of our approach and is complemented by the fact that namely in the defb cluster only  <dig> positions were genotyped by hapmap  <cit> .

there are no differences between known and putative novel snvs with respect to sequence depth and quality. the mean sequence depth of the known snvs is 59x  and 58x for the putative novel variations . for both known and putative novel snvs more than 97% of the variants have p-values <10- <dig> 

out of the  <dig>  snvs identified in the two genomes,  <dig> are coding variations . thereof, in the defb cluster,  <dig> snvs  were found in the coding sequences of defb <dig>  defb <dig>  defb <dig> and defb <dig>  none of these  <dig> snvs are novel variations. in contrast,  <dig> putative novel snvs were identified in the non-coding parts of the defb cluster. this indicates that sequence divergence between defb cluster paralogs rather evolves in non-coding than in protein-coding regions and protein dosage is realized by different expression levels of alleles. this is in accordance with hardwick et al.  <cit>  showing that the different levels of defb <dig> expression are not only the result of variable gene copy numbers but also controlled by rapidly evolving snvs in regulatory regions."

by pcr and sanger sequencing we confirmed 95%  of the putative novel snvs. the unconfirmed snv which was found to be homozygote for the hg <dig> allele by sanger sequencing, belongs to a group of  <dig> variations with vafs <25% in  <dig> sequencing. the vaf for the not confirmed snv  is in the range for  <dig> deviating copy out of  <dig>  indicating the difficulty to distinguish between variations of this type and false positives of the applied method. candidate snvs with vaf ≥25% were all confirmed.

although this study is focused on snvs, polymorphic insertions/deletions  may cause particular phenotypes and have to be assessed in future studies.

haplotypes and copy numbers
with average sequence lengths between  <dig> and  <dig> bp the obtained gs flx sequences were suitable for the identification of haplotypes in regions with a certain snv density. in total,  <dig> snvs were informative for the identification of  <dig> different haplotypes in the defb regions of na <dig> and na <dig> 

high sequencing depth and the calculation of read ratios is essential for haplotype-based cn estimation. in the present capture experiment, the sequencing depth was at the lower bound for a reliable cn determination. in the case of na <dig>   <dig> informative snv combinations with an average of  <dig> reads per combination were available in defb. all of them exhibit  <dig> haplotypes per locus, strongly supporting the defb number of  <dig> per diploid genome as previously determined by other methods  <cit> . in contrast, read ratios were consistent with an expected 1: <dig> ratio of haplotypes only in  <dig> of the haplotyped regions. nevertheless, artificially improving sequencing depth by summing up read counts for all loci resulted in a very robust haplotype ratio of  <dig> : <dig>  .

for na <dig> with a higher defb cn of  <dig>  the average number of sequences per snv combination was ~ <dig>  again, this is below the requirements for reliable de novo cn estimation, in particular if the diplotype comprises more than  <dig> copies. as consequence, defb cn estimations for na <dig> by individual haplotype regions ranged between  <dig> and  <dig>  however, due to the higher number of reads per haplotyped region,  <dig> cn estimations were possible with an average ~ <dig> copies per diploid genome as previously determined by alternative methods  <cit> . since consistent cn estimations were made from snvs spread over the entire defb region  our haplotyping results also confirm the concordance of cns for all genes within the cluster  <cit> .

completeness of snv identification
in total, 82% of the ctrl, defa and defb target regions were tiled by sequence capture probes in our assay. the remaining untiled parts are located in repetitive elements and/or regions with segmental duplications. sequences and therefore hcdiffs from such regions however can be obtained from enriched dna fragments captured by probes at the edges of non-repetitive/non-duplicated regions. due to the uniqueness of the fragment in its non-repetitive part, the hcdiffs outside of it should be correctly assigned to their chromosomal position and we regarded them as reliable variations. indeed,  <dig>  out of  <dig>  snvs from both dnas are located within ±  <dig> bp around tiled regions and  <dig>  thereof are embedded in repetitive elements.

while captured fragments extending the tiled regions increase the fraction of sequence covered target parts, it is decreased by ineffective probes. the probe efficiencies are hard to estimate but are reflected by regions not or poorly covered by  <dig> sequences despite being tiled. for example, the mean sequence depth of the defa1a <dig> genes, spanning ~ <dig> kb and located in the 178-kb-defa cluster is underrepresented in both capture experiments, with only 7x compared to 37x for the entire cluster in na <dig> 

due to the described opposite effects and because the true number of nucleotide differences between the target regions of the investigated dnas and the hg <dig> reference is unknown, we cannot exactly quantify the completeness of our snv identification with respect to the whole target regions. we can, however, give an estimation based on the sequence depths. in the sequence alignments of na <dig> and na <dig>  87% and 91% of the target positions are covered by more than  <dig> sequences, respectively . hcdiff identification by the reference mapper software is based on a combination of flow signal and quality score and requires a minimum number of sequences, the presence of both forward and reverse reads covering the difference etc. the minimal requirement for classification of a position as hcdiff is the coverage by ≥ <dig> sequences in both orientations with phred quality ≥q <dig>  <cit>  representing the variant, unless there are ≥ <dig> reads in just one orientation.

therefore, as a conservative calculation, we estimate the completeness of our snv identification in na <dig> to less than ~87% with respect to the entire target regions. regarding the identified  <dig>  snvs this would mean that we have missed at least ~ <dig> snvs, probably located predominantly in repetitive regions.

with respect to the sensitivity of variation detection in the cn variable defb, we can assume the same 98% sensitivity for the tiled regions of the 2-copy sample na <dig> as it is with one copy per haploid genome genetically identical to the hapmap loci, from which the sensitivity measure was derived. this high sensitivity/specificity was achieved by eliminating all variations with a vaf <25%. of the final  <dig> na <dig> defb snvs only  <dig>  show a vaf <25%. in contrast, 43%  of the na <dig> defb snvs exhibit a vaf <25%. these variations most likely are present in only one of the  <dig> defb cluster copies. moreover, these variations are heavily selected against by our stringent quality filters . thus, it has to be expected that the sensitivity of our approach significantly drops in regions with higher copy numbers. to estimate the sensitivity for the 6-copy na <dig> defb, we assume  <dig> snvs  per haploid defb. thus we would expect in the case of na <dig> a 3-times higher overall number of  <dig>  defb snvs. having observed  <dig>  na <dig> defb snvs demonstrate a sensitivity of 56% in a 6-copy case.

mapping and analysis errors are another source of missing variations. for our identifications we solely used the high confidence differences  extracted by the reference mapper software . sequence differences in the alignment not fulfilling these requirements escape the snv identification by our approach. in addition we observed a problem of the reference mapper detecting hcdiffs when two differences between  <dig> read and reference appear at adjacent positions. for example, snv <dig> at chr8: <dig> , <dig>  used for haplotyping in na <dig> is located beside another polymorphism  not identified as hcdiff . although we expect only a minute portion of differences missed by this shortcoming it may reduce the completeness of snv identification.

CONCLUSIONS
by ngs of target enriched dnas, individual snps and snvs can be assessed even in highly polymorphic and cnv regions such as the human defensin gene locus. snv identification is highly specific and reveals a considerable amount of putative novel individual polymorphisms. furthermore it allows simultaneous cn estimations by haplotyping. the sensitivity of the method is limited by sequencing depth and stringency of data filtering. moreover, the observed lower sensitivity of the snv detection in samples with higher cn may reflect capture-probe saturation and indicates the need for adjustment of sequencing depth and cn. despite the costs sequence capture/ngs of copy number variable regions is a valuable source for identifying the growing number of causative variations for phenotypes/diseases.

schematic view of the targeted regions defa and defb  and their overlap to low copy repeats  according to the classification in ref.  <cit> . lcr i contains successive copies of the defa1/a3/t <dig> genes/pseudogenes and has no paralogs elsewhere in the human genome. lcr v has two paralogs, representing the two defb copies annotated in the hg <dig> reference genome. in contrast, lcr iv has additional paralogs with up to 98% nucleotide identity which are enriched together with the targeted defb cluster hampering the snv identification in the lcr iv region. therefore, all hcdiffs from the targeted part of the lcr iv region  were discarded.
