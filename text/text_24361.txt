BACKGROUND
the orchidaceae family comprises an estimated  <dig>  species and is one of the largest families of flowering plants. the oncidiinae subtribe consists of ~ <dig> closely related genera and > <dig> species, of which oncidium is the largest genus  <cit> . like other orchids, oncidiinae can be easily crossed intergenerically, or across species, to produce flowers with unique colors, fragrances and shapes. oncidium has become a commercially important flower in the orchid industry. oncidium 'gower ramsey'  is one of the most important oncidium cut-flower varieties; it is an interspecific hybrid derived from onc. flexuosum, onc. sphacelatum and onc. varicosum. onc. gr is a yellow flower variety that can flower year-round. the length of inflorescence is ~ <dig> m, with hundreds of ca.  <dig> cm flowers.

functional genomic studies of orchids remain a challenge owing to large genome size, low transformation efficiency and long life cycles  <cit> . however, gene transformation of onc. gr has been established  <cit> , offering an alternative strategy for oncidium breeding and making it a priority to investigate and obtain oncidium promoters. to date, several strategies have been used to investigate orchids at the genomic level. sequence homology searches have identified homologous genes in oncidium  <cit> , and expressed sequence tag  databases have been used for gene cloning  <cit> . because model plants, such as rice and a. thaliana, do not contain all plant genes, and because some genes related to the unique morphological and physiological characteristics of oncidium, such as the flower and pseudobulbs cannot be identified using sequence homology, an oncidium-specific cdna library of pseudobulbs and flowers has been established that contains a large amount of genetic information  <cit> . however, gene expression patterns cannot be predicted by nucleic acid sequences. furthermore, several of the non-model plant est sequences are not full-length sequences.

to clone full-length genes and promoters, further processing is necessary, such as rapid amplification of complementary dna ends  for full-length cdna, or genomic walking for promoter studies  <cit> . these techniques are difficult to apply to onc. gr because its genome is complex and has not been sequenced. bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries are an alternative tool for full-length gene and promoter cloning. to obtain such libraries, genomic dna is cut into pieces of ~ <dig> kb, cloned into a vector and stored in bacteria, making it is easier to obtain the promoter and the full length of the target gene without interference from homologs in the genome. various strategies can then be used to identify the clones that contain target genes  <cit> , and the identified clones can be sequenced directly to obtain the full-length gene sequence.

in this report, a cdna microarray, a bac library and a bombardment assay were combined to establish a novel platform that was used to identify and clone the onc. gr genes and promoters abundantly expressed in onc. gr flowers. this approach, combining multiple tools provides a fast, easy to use and convenient strategy for obtaining useful genetic information about oncidium.

RESULTS
using cdna microarray to identify genes highly expressed in flowers
a cdna microarray was used to identify genes that are abundantly expressed in flowers. pcr products of  <dig> clones from the cdna library of onc. gr were spotted on to slides to establish a flower-derived microarray. a total of  <dig> clones were upregulated by >3-fold and  <dig> clones were downregulated >3-fold relative to the leaves .

sequencing revealed that several clones were repeated. among the  <dig> clones corresponding to genes highly expressed in flowers,  <dig> were unique genes. among the clones corresponding to genes highly expressed in leaves,  <dig> were related to photosynthesis/chloroplasts  as expected; photosynthesis-related genes were highly expressed in leaves.

genes in which the flower/leaf expression ratio was > <dig>  are presented in table  <dig>  gastrodianin and aquaporin were duplicated in the microarray but appeared as different ratios. as no suitable rt-pcr primers for the gene similar to cae <dig>  could be identified, rt-pcr of the remaining  <dig> genes was performed to validate the microarray results. cytosolic malate dehydrogenase was the only gene whose rt-pcr results were inconsistent with the microarray. the other  <dig> genes were highly expressed in reproductive tissues including flowers and stalks . three of them, onti <dig>  onti <dig>  and onti <dig>  shared sequence homology with known trypsin inhibitors  and probably have similar functions. the remaining two, although highly expressed in flowers, were expressed at different development stages or in different flower organs . disease resistance response protein  was expressed in fully blooming flowers and expansin  was highly expressed in the lip  extending stage. the  <dig> trypsin inhibitor genes were expressed at all stages, but most abundantly during the flower bud stage. in reproductive organs, onexpansin and onti <dig> were predominantly expressed in the lips. onti <dig> was highly expressed in the callus.

values are presented as average Â± sd of  <dig> biological replicates . "onhy" denotes that no similar protein was identified using blastx.

promoter cloning using a bac library
having used rt-pcr to confirm that these  <dig> genes were highly expressed in flowers, they were used for further promoter studies. bac clones that contained the target genes were used for promoter cloning. there are ~ <dig>  clones in the onc. gr bac library. because the target gene sequences were known, pcr was used for screening. bac screening was performed on a total of  <dig> genes; the  <dig> genes highly expressed in flowers as detailed above, and  <dig> previously published oncidium flower-related genes . these  <dig> genes were located in  <dig> different clones. interestingly, the  <dig> trypsin inhibitor genes were located in the same clone, and tandemly duplicated sequences were found in onti <dig> and onti <dig>  a hypothetical gene, onhy <dig>  was located between onti <dig> and onti <dig> . the putative protein sequence contains a bowman-birk serine protease inhibitor domain in the n-terminal region, similar to lens culinaris trypsin inhibitor ; and an amino acid sequence between  <dig> aa and  <dig> aa that is similar to a transposase domain.

identifying protein sub-cellular localization using fusion with fluorescent proteins
oncidium lip bombardment-mediated transformation was used to investigate the subcellular location of the protein products of the particular genes that were identified by microarray. published protein markers were used to identify the organelles in the oncidium cells of which the endomembrane system was most difficult to distinguish. multiple protein markers derived from different plant species  <cit>  indicated that these marker plasmids can be delivered into cells to synthesize fluorescent proteins . not only could the endomembrane systems be identified, but vird2-nls -mcherry  could be used as a nuclear marker  <cit> .

for the oncidium genes investigated, no difference in the fluorescence patterns was observed when proteins were expressed as n- or c-terminal fusions with a fluorescent protein . the  <dig> onti proteins were seen as aggregated particles in the cells . the subcellular locations of these proteins differed from endomembrane markers, such as mitochondria . for yfp-onexpasin, fluorescent signals were evident in the intercellular space and at the cell wall , and for ondrrp fluorescent signals appeared as a network system throughout the cell .

use of multiple tools to identify promoters
the  <dig> genes of interest were expressed in the lips; therefore, the onc. gr lip was used for transient transformation. oncidium alcohol acyl-transferase can be expressed in the leaves and flowers; its promoter  was used as a positive control to demonstrate successful transformation. to investigate the promoter of onti <dig>  various lengths  of the promoter region fused to the gus reporter gene were introduced into the cells using the bombardment method. plasmid pjd <dig> containing 35s-luc was co-bombarded as a reference control. the highest gus activity was evident with the  <dig> bp length promoter. interestingly, similar gus activity was detected in the leaves using the leaves using the  <dig> and  <dig> bp lengths of the promoter region. gus activities in the leaves were repressed in the transformants that had a promoter length of equal to or longer than  <dig> bp . for onexpansin, gus activity in the leaves of all promoter transformants was low. gus activity in the flower was correlated with promoter length, except for the  <dig> bp region, which had significantly reduced activity . different lengths of onexpansin promoter-gus constructs were transformed into a. thaliana. with the exception of the  <dig> bp transformants, gus activity was detected in flowers and minimal activity was present in the leaves . various lengths of onti <dig> and ondrrp promoters were constructed and a promoter assay was conducted . the constructs of onexpansin, ont <dig> and ont <dig> yielding the highest flower/leaf gus activity were then transformed into a. thaliana. the transformants of onexpansin had the highest gus activity in the flowers , whereas that of ondrrp had the lowest . onexpansin had gus activity in the leaves . the flower gus activity patterns for both onti <dig> and onti <dig> promoters were similar. staining was observed at the top of the styles and at the junction of the pedicel and flowers .

discussion
identification of oncidium reproductive-specific expression of genes using cdna microarray
the aim of this study was to establish a successful combination of integrated tools to obtain genetic information about the commercially important cut flower onc. gr. a combination of a cdna library, a microarray, a bac library and transient transformation was effective. however, the microarray and cdna library that was used had several limitations:  in gene families that have conserved regions and share sequence identity, binding occurs that can limit the specificity of the data. for example, we found that gastrodianin, aquaporin and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase gave false positives.  the clone number was limited. there were only  <dig> clones in the microarray, which cover only a fraction of the oncidium genome. the estimated genome size is 1c =  <dig>  pg, http://data.kew.org/cvalues/cvalservlet?querytype= <dig>  the estimated coverage of the onc. gr bac library is thus  <dig>  fold, thereby limiting its possible uses.  only a few genes that are highly expressed in leaves were identified because the microarray was composed from a flower cdna library. to widen the use of this array, more sequence information needs to be integrated. for example, further libraries must be derived from different tissues and treatments. sequences from next generation sequencing are an alternative resource for obtaining this data. in comparison to the traditionally employed method , using high-throughput approaches allows several thousand ests to be obtained cost-effectively from different tissues with less space and effort. specific gene sequences can then be printed and a microarray yielding more detailed data can be useful for a variety of applications.

bac library construction is a useful tool for cloning promoters
polyploidy is a common phenomenon in crop species. in the indigenous species of oncidium, the chromosome number is 2n =  <dig> http://data.kew.org/cvalues/cvalservlet?querytype=1; however, the chromosome number in onc. gr is  <dig>  therefore, it is expected that there are several homologous genes in the genome of onc. gr. in addition, tandem duplication, such as that found in the onti genes, or tandem repeat sequences such as those found in onft and omads <dig>  would render genome walking using a pcr strategy particularly difficult to perform . in many cases, it would take several months to identify a single gene. by screening a bac library, target genes are narrowed down to those with lengths of  <dig> kb, thereby reducing the problems related to homologous genes, tandem repeat sequences and secondary structure. in addition, the pcr strategy used herein can identify the bac clone containing a target gene within a week, and regions of interest can be sequenced using bac end sequencing .

two strategies are used for bac library screening: hybridization and pcr screening. as the gene sequences of the target genes were known in this study, the pcr screening strategy could be adopted. recent improvements in pcr technology and protocols have made bac screening more efficient and several genes have been successfully cloned using pcr to screen bac libraries  <cit> . we thus used this strategy to obtain bac clones containing genes of interest in the onc. gr library.

three trypsin inhibitor genes, onti <dig>  onti <dig> and onti <dig>  which are highly expressed in flowers, are tandemly duplicated
three tandemly duplicated genes, onti <dig>  onti <dig> and onti that are highly expressed in flowers were identified. gene duplications that encode similar gene functions are a common phenomenon in plants and are thought to have contributed to the origin of evolutionary 'novelties'  <cit> . for example, it has been proposed that in the early evolution of orchids, two rounds of deficens-like mads-box gene duplications generated the genes that were probably recruited to distinguish the different types of orchid perianth organs  <cit> . information about tandem duplicates can be useful in investigations pertaining to gene duplication. for example, the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase gene  <cit> , the r2r3-myb family of transcription factors genes  <cit>  and nac domain transcription factors genes  <cit>  are tandemly duplicated in populus trichocarpa. these genes have been duplicated from the same ancestral gene, allowing the expression pattern of these genes to be correlated. an investigation of the gene locations of the nac domain transcription factors in populus trichocarpa showed that  <dig> pairs of nacs are present as tandem duplicates, represented in tandem clusters of  <dig> or  <dig> genes each. in the tandemly duplicated clusters with  <dig> genes, the expression patterns of  <dig> of the genes were found almost identical. however, in the tandemly duplicated clusters with  <dig> genes, the gene expression levels differed significantly  <cit> . in the current study, the expression patterns of onti genes were similar. on the basis of sequence homology, we discovered  <dig> conserved regions upstream of onti <dig> similar to onti <dig>  and onti <dig> . we tentatively suggest that these ontis may be derived from the same ancestral gene.

several di- or tri-nucleotide tandem repeats were evident in the flower-related genes . because information on oncidium is limited, the biological significance of tandem repeats in these genes remains unclear. the end sequencing of this bac library may provide suitable information for identifying the relationship between flower-related genes and tandem repeat sequences.

transient transformation is a suitable tool for determining the subcellular localization of protein
the subcellular location of a protein is related to its function. for example, photosynthesis-related proteins are located in chloroplasts. therefore, experiments aimed at determining the specific localization of proteins can provide information on biological processes  <cit> . computational prediction is one method used to investigate the subcellular localization of a protein  <cit> . however, as yet, no suitable reference database exists for oncidium. experimentally, the subcellular localization of a protein can be studied by imaging it after fusion with a fluorescent protein  <cit> . however, no suitable protocol for investigating subcellular localization has so far been established for orchids. in this report, a transient transformation system for the orchid lip using markers derived from different species as fluorescent markers was established to study subcellular localization of proteins.

trypsin inhibitors can be used to reduce trypsin activity, which can play an active role against pests and diseases  <cit> . the expression of trypsin inhibitor genes can also be induced by water stress  <cit>  and stress-related plant growth regulators  <cit> . constitutive expression of a trypsin inhibitor can improve plant tolerance to abiotic stress  <cit> . trypsin inhibitors are present in all protein bodies, and to a lesser extent in the nucleus and intercellular space  <cit> . here, we found that onti proteins can form particles similar to protein bodies, but they were not in the nucleus or intercellular space.

expansins are a superfamily of proteins crucial in loosening the cell wall. the expansins consist of  <dig> domains, the glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  catalytic domain and group- <dig> grass pollen allergens. experimental evidence indicates that expansins can induce slippage of cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall which becomes loosened  <cit> . the expansin was located in the cell wall and in the intercell wall spaces  <cit> . the fluorescent signal for onexpansin was located around the cell wall; according to the results obtained using rt-pcr, onexpansin was highly expressed in the lips and during lip expansion. therefore, this gene may be correlated with onc. gr lip development.

in summary, the localizations of the proteins we investigated are correlated with their predicted functions, but the roles of these genes during oncidium flower development are unknown as their overexpression in a. thaliana flowers did not result in any significant change in terms of flowering time or morphology.

useful genetic information can be mined using this integrated platform
promoters of oncidium were successfully cloned using a combination of a cdna library, microarray, bac library and transient transformation. transformation of oncidium is time-consuming and requires considerable human resources. use of a transient expression system reduced the time required to obtain preliminary information to ~ <dig> week. this approach is thus more time-efficient than genomic walking and stable transformation methods, and allows investigators to estimate experimental priorities.

there are  <dig> conserved regions in the promoter regions of onti genes. the onti <dig> promoter study demonstrated that box  <dig>  box  <dig> and box  <dig> were not related to flower expression. the onti <dig> promoter, which does not have these regions, can be expressed in flowers. the most important region controlling the repression in leaves is situated between box  <dig> and the repeat region. there is a potential agamous binding site in this region and there is a similar region in the onti <dig> promoter region . unlike the repression of onti <dig> in leaves, the most important region for flower expression in onexpansin is located between - <dig> to - <dig> bp. it is expected that the regulation of onexpansin expression is different from that of onti <dig>  interestingly,  <dig> potential tf-binding domains  are flower or development related. the relevance of the agamous binding site for gene repression in leaves and flower expression, however, requires further investigation.

the promoter regions of onti, onexpansin and oncidium mads genes contain nucleotide tandem repeat sequences . however, promoter studies demonstrated that the tandem repeats in onti <dig> and onexpansin promoters are not related to gene expression. according to our data, the promoter region controlling flower/leaf expression is within  <dig> kb of the promoter. analysis of other gene promoters  produced similar results .

the clones which contain ~  <dig> kb promoter regions fused with gus were transformed into a. thaliana. although gus staining was more prominent in flowers, there were some unexpected results. in onexpansin, gus staining was evident in the leaves despite the rt-pcr results demonstrating that onexpansin is predominantly expressed in the lips of oncidium. in a. thaliana, gus was weakly expressed in petals, but highly expressed in anthers and styles . the onti genes were predominantly expressed in the oncidium lip and callus. however, there was no gus staining in the petals of the a. thaliana transformants. these results may be due to the absence of a transcription factor that can recognize the oncidium binding site, highlighting the necessity of identifying species-specific promoters. the promoters we found were only  <dig> kb in size. the region that controls the specific organ of interest may not have been included, producing unexpected results in stable a. thaliana transformation.

CONCLUSIONS
a cdna library, a microarray, a bac library and transient transformation were combined to identify gene promoters highly expressed in the flowers of oncidium gower ramsey, a commercially important cut flower. classical approaches of identifying orchid genes and promoters - in particular the genome walking method - cannot easily be performed when regions of high dna sequence homology tandem repeats and tandemly duplicated genes are present. gene sequences of interest were identified successfully using bac sequencing. using lip transient transformation, gus reporter gene fusion constructs with various lengths of promoters were introduced into the lip to determine promoter activity. furthermore, the subcellular localization of proteins encoded in these genes was also determined in this system. with this combination of approaches,  <dig> novel oncidium gene promoters of genes abundantly expressed in flowers were cloned and confirmed. these promoters can be used to express genes in floral organs and change the flower phenotype without affecting the vegetative tissues.
