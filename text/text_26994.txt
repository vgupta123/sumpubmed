BACKGROUND
fish of the genus carassius , including goldfish, crucian carp, and japanese crucian carp, primarily inhabit freshwater and are distributed widely in and around the eurasian continent, including taiwan and the japanese islands  <cit> . although their classification has not been well established due to their great variability, they can be classified into at least three species: c. auratus, c. carassius, and c. cuvieri. among them, c. auratus is so variable that its varieties are sometimes treated as independent species or subspecies . it should be noted that the variability is further enhanced by the existence of goldfish , which are domesticated ornamental fish that have been produced under artificial selection and are widespread throughout the world. recently, goldfish were shown to have originated from one group of chinese c. auratus  <cit> . carassius in and around japan are very common and variable. although japanese carassius have recently been arranged into c. cuvieri and five subspecies of c. auratus  <cit> , identification of the five subspecies is controversial because of difficulties in distinguishing morphological and molecular characters  <cit> .

in addition to the variability described above, the c. auratus-complex includes not only bisexual diploid lineages but also unisexual gynogenetic triploid lineages  <cit> , and the origin of the triploids is controversial. some ichthyologists consider each subspecies of c. auratus to include both bisexual diploid and gynogenetic triploid lineages  <cit> , whereas others regard all gynogenetic triploids as belonging to the species of the japanese c. auratus langsdorfii  <cit> . in the latter case, c. a. langsdorfii is considered to be a species consisting only of triploids with no diploids. to resolve the complicated situations in the natural history and systematics of the fish, one must clarify the biological entities of c. auratus, taking into account the existence of triploids.

genetic and phylogenetic analyses based on dna information usually are effective in clarifying details about the biological entity of a "species." phylogenetic analyses of the japanese c. auratus-complex have been conducted using the first third of the control region  of mitochondrial dna , which is generally the most variable and is thus useful for phylogenetic investigations of closely related organisms  <cit> . some of these analyses detected a large degree of genetic divergence between c. cuvieri and c. auratus  <cit> . heterogeneity was found within c. auratus in japan, although the five subspecies of c. auratus mentioned above could not be discriminated by the analyses based on cr sequences  <cit> . moreover, it is interesting to note that triploid c. auratus is polyphyletic in the japanese main islands  <cit> , as gynogenetic triploid fishes in other groups usually are monophyletic  <cit> . despite such efforts in analysing the phylogeny of the complex, well-resolved phylogenetic and evolutionary pictures have not be obtained because of two biases.

the first type of bias involves the selection of sampling sites in island regions in east asia. these regions are biologically important because they harbour old lineages of various freshwater fishes [e.g.,  <cit> . we anticipate that clarifying the biological entity of the c. auratus-complex in this region would provide a useful basis for future comprehensive studies of the complex. however, in previous studies of japanese c. auratus, the specimens examined were only collected from the main islands and not from the ryukyu archipelago. obtaining a complete picture of the evolutionary relationships in east asian c. auratus is difficult without specimens from this biogeographically important region, where an old island area intermittently was connected to the eurasian continent during its long history  <cit> . terrestrial and freshwater fauna of the ryukyu archipelago are unique in that they include many endemic species and subspecies that have evolved independently on these isolated islands. in total,  <dig>  of  <dig> known terrestrial and freshwater species are endemic to the central and southern ryukyus  <cit> . for example, the ryukyu-ayu, plecoglossus altivelis ryukyuensis, is considered an endemic subspecies in inland waters of the central ryukyus  <cit> . in addition, not only primary freshwater fish  but also brackish-water fish  of the ryukyu archipelago are genetically distinct from adjacent conspecific populations  <cit> . therefore, c. auratus of the ryukyu archipelago is also expected to have differentiated from other populations. inspection of c. auratus from the ryukyu archipelago is crucial in clarifying the phylogenetic picture of c. auratus distributed in the island regions of east asia.

the second bias involves selection of the dna region analysed. previous phylogenetic analyses of c. auratus mainly used mtdna, particularly the first third of the cr [e.g.,  <cit> . analyses using maternally inherited mtdna are highly effective for estimating phylogenetic relationships of organisms, including gynogenetic populations such as c. auratus, although they are not as effective in detecting hybridisation conditions  <cit> . the abundance of published mtdna sequences also makes mtdna attractive for phylogenetic analyses of c. auratus because these sequences can be used for comparative analyses. however, using the cr is questionable because a "genetic ceiling" of cr sequences has been detected not only at the intrafamily level  <cit>  but also at the intraspecies level  <cit> . as the possibility of a genetic ceiling of cr sequences in c. auratus cannot be excluded, more comprehensive phylogenetic analyses using other mtdna regions in addition to the cr are required. although mtdna may not be necessarily effective in estimating accurate phylogenetic relationship, recent research using aflp analysis and mtdna analysis showed that both mitochondrial and nuclear dnas lead basically the same result in estimating phylogenetic relationships in the c. auratus-complex  <cit> .

the present study was conducted to generate phylogenetic and evolutionary pictures of east asian c. auratus populations by eliminating selection bias in sampling sites and mtdna regions analysed. specimens of c. auratus were collected from the ryukyu archipelago in addition to areas in and around the japanese main islands that have been studied previously. after ploidy determination of the specimens, we sequenced the nadh dehydrogenase subunits  <dig>  and  <dig> , the cytochrome b apoenzyme  genes, and the cr for phylogenetic analyses using neighbour-joining , maximum likelihood , and bayesian inference  methods. the results of these phylogenetic analyses were examined in relation to the geographic distribution of the species. in addition, divergence times between main clades were estimated based on the resulting phylogenetic trees.

methods
samples
as previously noted, systematics of the genus carassius have not been well established. because no generally acceptable global classification system for carassius exists, we treated all c. auratus specimens  as c. auratus without further classification.

we collected  <dig> c. auratus from  <dig> islands of the ryukyu archipelago  using cast-, gill-, and hand-nets between  <dig> and  <dig>  most specimens were released immediately at the same site after collecting blood or fin samples and sexing as described below. blood collected from the caudal vein with a small syringe was immediately preserved at -20°c in  <dig> % ethanol. fin clips were also fixed in  <dig> % ethanol. in addition,  <dig> c. auratus specimens were bought at two fish markets in taiwan in  <dig>  and the collected fin clips were fixed in  <dig> % ethanol.

the sex of all specimens collected from the ryukyu archipelago was determined. based on previous observations that all males >  <dig> mm standard length  from okinawa island had pearl organs  and ejected sperm after squeezing the abdominal area throughout the year  <cit> , individuals >  <dig> mm  with both pearl organs and sperm ejection were considered to be male; all others were considered to be female. all specimens <  <dig> mm sl were regarded as unknown sex.

in addition to the  <dig> newly collected specimens , we used  <dig> fin or muscle tissue samples collected from honshu, shikoku, and kyushu , russia, and china  <cit>  deposited at the ocean research institute, the university of tokyo .

ploidy determination
we determined the ploidy of specimens by measuring the relative dna content of the blood samples by flow cytometry  using a paii type flow cytometer . fcm was performed using the manufacturer's protocol with minor modifications. briefly, 2- <dig> μl aliquots of blood suspensions were resuspended in  <dig> μl of extraction buffer  and incubated for over  <dig> min at room temperature. subsequently,  <dig> μl of 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  staining solution  was added. a sample of blood collected from a single diploid c. auratus from the japanese main islands  <cit>  was used as an internal standard for each fcm profile.

dna extraction, pcr amplification and sequencing
nucleotide sequence data for part of the cr  of the mitochondrial genome were obtained from all  <dig> specimens collected from the ryukyu archipelago or purchased at fish markets in taiwan. these sequences were analysed along with  <dig> published sequences obtained from a total of  <dig> c. auratus specimens collected from the japanese main islands , russia , and china , along with goldfish   <cit> . one specimen was then chosen from each of the different cr haplotypes from a total of  <dig> sequences , and additional sequence data were obtained from  <dig> of the  <dig> newly collected specimens and from  <dig> of the deposited specimens collected by yamamoto et al.  <cit>  for the whole nd <dig> , nd <dig> , and cyt b  genes.

total genomic dna was extracted from all specimens using either a dneasy tissue kit  or an aquapure genomic dna isolation kit  in accordance with the manufacturers' protocols. all fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction  with various combinations of  <dig> primers  using a model  <dig> thermal cycler . pcr conditions were as follows:  <dig> min at 92°c; 30- <dig> cycles at 94°c for 10- <dig> sec; 48-55°c for 10- <dig> sec; 72°c for  <dig> sec; and a final extension at 75°c for  <dig> min. for the cr and cyt b regions, target segments were amplified directly. for the nd <dig> and nd <dig> genes, a segment of about  <dig> bp from the nd4l to nd <dig> genes that spans the nd <dig> and nd <dig> genes was amplified. the pcr products were diluted in sterilized te buffer  for subsequent use as short pcr templates. all short pcr products were purified using an exosap-it purification kit  and then sequenced with dye-labelled terminators  using the same primers as for pcr. all reactions for dna sequencing were run on abi  <dig> or  <dig> sequencers .

neighbour-joining analysis of the control region
the  <dig> newly determined cr sequences were analysed together with  <dig> previously published sequences of the same cr region from  <dig> c. auratus specimens  collected from honshu, shikoku, kyushu, russia, and china  <cit>  and with the  <dig> sequences from  <dig> goldfish specimens collected from japan and china  <cit>  . in the first step of the analyses, a nj tree was constructed under the best fit model gtr + Γ + i  <cit>  in mrmodeltest ver.  <dig>   <cit>  using the program paup*  <dig> b8a  <cit> . cyprinus carpio {dna databank of japan /embl nucleotide sequence database /genbank genetic sequence databank  accession number, ap009047;  <cit> } and carassius cuvieri  were used as outgroups to root the tree. the reliability of tree nodes was assessed by the bootstrap  method with  <dig> replications.

maximum likelihood and bayesian analysis
for the accurate estimation of phylogenetic relationships and divergence time between mtdna haplotypes, the nucleotide sequences of three protein genes  were analysed in addition to the cr sequences. because the rates of nucleotide sequence evolution differ among dna regions and among codon positions, ml and bi methods that can reflect these differences were used for the analyses. partitioned ml analysis was conducted with raxml ver.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . we prepared five datasets  for analyses and set three partitions  or four partitions  assuming that functional constraints on sequence evolution are more similar within codon positions  across genes than across codon positions  within genes. the gtr + Γ model  <cit>   was used and rapid bs analysis was conducted with  <dig> replications . this option performs bs analysis using gtrcat, which is the gtr approximation with optimisation of individual per-site substitution rates, and classifies those individual rates into a certain number of rate categories. after implementing the bs analysis, the program uses every 5th bs tree as a starting point to search for the ml tree using the gtr + Γ model of sequence evolution and saves the top  <dig> best-scoring ml trees . finally, raxml calculates better likelihood scores  for these  <dig> trees and places bs probabilities on the best-scoring ml tree. cyprinus carpio  and carassius cuvieri  were used as outgroups to root all ml trees.

bi analyses were performed with mrbayes ver.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . we prepared exactly the same five datasets as those used in ml analyses. monte carlo markov chains under the selected best fit model gtr + i , gtr + Γ , and gtr + Γ + i  in mrmodeltest ver.  <dig>  were run for  <dig> , <dig> generations. trees and parameters were sampled every  <dig> generations. we discarded the first  <dig> , <dig> generations  on each run as "burn-in" after confirming chain stationarity from plots of likelihood against generation. outgroups were the same as those used in the ml analyses.

supermatrix analysis
to conduct a more comprehensive investigation of the phylogenetic relationships among carassius species on a worldwide basis using the best-scoring ml tree topology obtained from the above analysis as a backbone constraint, we downloaded partial mitochondrial sequences of the genus from the databases  and concatenated these sequences to the prealigned original dataset in fasta format for each gene or region. of the  <dig> cr,  <dig> cyt b, and  <dig> nd <dig> sequences,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were judged to be authentic and reliable with clear locality information with reference to the original paper and preliminary alignment, respectively . these sequences were included in the supermatrix analysis and the rest were excluded. incidentally, these excluded sequences did not change the tree topologies of the resultant supermatrix tree when they were included in the analysis, with an exception of one cr sequence from kazakhstan, whose phylogenetic position was extremely unstable. the concatenated sequences were subjected to multiple alignment using mafft ver.  <dig>  <cit>  with the default parameters. we imported the aligned sequences into macclade ver.  <dig>   <cit>  and removed the redundant regions appearing as gaps with slight modifications by eye to correctly reproduce the original alignment. finally, the aligned sequences from each gene or region were concatenated using macclade to generate a mitochondrial supermatrix consisting of  <dig> sequences, including  <dig> sequences from the databases. the supermatrix was subjected to partitioned ml analysis using raxml ver.  <dig> . <dig> with the best-scoring ml tree topology from the original dataset used as a backbone constraint . the evolution model used and the bs analysis performed in this analysis were the same as those described in the above ml analyses. outgroups were also the same as those in the previous ml and bi analyses.

divergence time estimation
to obtain a rough estimate of the divergence times of major cladogenic events in c. auratus, we used two different procedures. the first method uses the molecular clock. divergence times were calculated per clade according to the evolutionary rate of  <dig> %  per million year  estimated for cyt b sequences of cyprinid fish by zardoya and doardio  <cit> . the second method uses the fossil record. the concatenated ml tree obtained was transformed into an ultrametric tree using a non-parametric rate smoothing  algorithm  <cit>  in treeedit ver.  <dig>   <cit> . the branches of the nprs tree were scaled using a divergence time of approximately  <dig>  million years ago  for the c. cuvieri lineage based on the oldest fossil record from the sakawa clay stratum  <cit> .

RESULTS
ploidy and sex of specimens from the ryukyu archipelago
the sex of  <dig> of the  <dig> specimens collected from the ryukyus was determined successfully . ploidy of  <dig> specimens was also determined . both sex and ploidy of a total of  <dig> specimens were determined . no triploid males were found, and all  <dig> tetraploids were too small to determine their sex. diploids were observed from  <dig> of  <dig> islands studied, triploids from six islands, and tetraploids from two islands .

cr haplotype phylogenies
dna segments of  <dig> bp of the cr were newly sequenced and aligned for the  <dig> c. auratus specimens . a total of  <dig> nucleotide positions  varied, and these variations defined  <dig> haplotypes. of these haplotypes, four were identical to previously reported haplotypes  <cit> , and the other  <dig> were newly detected . in addition to the  <dig> haplotypes,  <dig> sequences previously obtained in our laboratory  <cit> , six sequences of c. auratus collected from china  <cit> , and one goldfish sequence  <cit>  were added, providing a total of  <dig> cr haplotypes for phylogenetic analyses.

the nj tree based on the gtr + Γ + i model demonstrated that the  <dig> cr haplotypes were divided into seven major clades  based average gtr + Γ + i distances of  <dig> - <dig>  . both diploids and triploids were observed in all major clades, with the exception of clade v, which was composed only of specimens of unknown ploidy. furthermore, of the  <dig> haplotypes,  <dig> were shared by both diploids and triploids in five major clades , although  <dig> and  <dig> haplotypes consisted of only diploids and triploids, respectively.

ml and bi trees based on the cr data showed an essentially similar haplotype grouping as that of the nj tree . however, the ml and bi tree topologies differed somewhat from that of the nj tree; clade iii detected in the nj tree was not detected in the ml and bi trees.

nd <dig>  nd <dig> and cyt b haplotype phylogenies
dna samples were available for further sequencing for  <dig> out of  <dig> cr haplotypes. complete nd <dig>  nd <dig>  and cyt b genes  were successfully sequenced for  <dig> of  <dig> specimens chosen from each of the  <dig> cr haplotypes. one hundred and sixty three ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  variable sites without insertions or deletions were found, which defined  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> haplotypes, respectively, from each of the  <dig> sequences.

nj, ml, and bi trees based on each of the three protein-coding regions showed the same seven major clades as those detected in the cr-based nj tree . these seven clades were grouped into two superclades: a  and b . as expected from the results of cr-based nj analysis, sharing of a haplotype by diploids and triploids was observed in all three protein-coding regions .

because mtdna comprises a single circular molecule, it is preferable to use the  <dig> bp concatenated sequence of all four regions  to estimate the complete mtdna phylogeny. nj and best-scoring ml and bi trees based on the concatenated sequence corroborated the existence of the seven major clades and the two superclades revealed in the analyses described above, with higher bs values  and bi posterior probabilities . these seven major clades were separated by average gtr + Γ + i distances of  <dig> - <dig>  .

supermatrix analysis
the results of supermatrix analysis performed using the best-scoring ml tree topology as a backbone constraint are shown in figure  <dig>  all newly downloaded sequences of c. auratus from around the world were nested in either of the seven major clades detected in our analyses; these sequences did not form a new major clade. carassius carassius was placed as a sister group of the c. auratus-complex.

distribution pattern analysis of cr haplotypes
to clarify the relationships between the phylogenetic and geographical structures of c. auratus populations, we analysed the distribution pattern of haplotypes within each of the seven major clades. for this analysis, we focused on cr haplotypes because these contained the greatest number of specimens  and examined their geographical distribution in seven regional areas: honshu, shikoku, kyushu, the ryukyus, russia, taiwan, and china, defined based on relative isolation. as a result, in many major clades the distribution of the haplotypes was restricted to specific area . in particular, haplotypes of clades i, iv, and v were found only in honshu, the ryukyus, and the continental region including russia and china, respectively. similarly, haplotypes in clades ii, iii, and vi were distributed mainly in kyushu, honshu + shikoku, and taiwan, respectively, although some haplotypes of the three clades were found in the ryukyus . although haplotypes in clade vii were distributed over a wide geographical range, more than half  the haplotypes observed in china  belonged to this clade.

note that most haplotypes found outside of their main distribution areas were observed in distinctive water systems ). for example, three haplotypes  in clade vi that are typical of taiwan  were found in  <dig> of the  <dig> water systems sampled in the ryukyus, and  <dig> of these systems have artificial reservoirs . in addition, seven haplotypes  in clade vii that seemed to be indigenous to china  were observed in honshu , shikoku , kyushu , the ryukyus , and taiwan . many of these water systems inhabited by clade vii haplotypes were also distinctive ; the one in honshu was lake kasumigaura, which is well known for the surfeit of artificially introduced alien fish. in addition, the  <dig> water systems of the ryukyus have artificial reservoirs .

divergence time estimation
based on a cyt b calibration using the molecular clock value of  <dig> %/my, divergence time between superclades a and b was estimated to be about  <dig>  mya and between the seven major clades about  <dig> - <dig>  mya . when we applied the divergence time of approximately  <dig>  mya for the c. cuvieri lineage to the nprs ultrametric tree based on the best ml tree derived from the concatenated sequence data set, the divergence time between superclades a and b was estimated to be about  <dig>  mya . the divergence time among the seven major clades within superclades a and b was around  <dig>  mya, ranging from only  <dig>  to  <dig>  mya.

discussion
mtdna trees of east asian c. auratus
in this study, we examined mtdna to study the phylogeny of the island region-centred east asian c. auratus-complex. we analysed three protein-coding genes in addition to the cr, the latter of which has been used in previous phylogenetic analyses of these fish [e.g.,  <cit> . nj, ml, and bi analyses based on the concatenated sequence  all produced essentially the same tree topology. most nodes were supported by high nj and ml bs values and bi posterior probabilities. considering the robust tree topology obtained from all analyses, we considered these mtdna trees to adequately reflect the phylogeny of east asian c. auratus.

cr tree topologies differed from that of the concatenated tree in that the two superclades  were not well separated; this discrepancy might have been caused by a genetic ceiling, probably due to saturation, as in the chaetodontidae and plecoglossus altivelis  <cit> . in addition, whereas the first third of the cr was more variable than the three protein-coding genes , the total number of variable sites was considerably smaller in the former than in the latter genes . it seems that the first third of the cr was effective in detecting each lineage in our nj analysis but was less effective in resolving branching order. longer sequences of protein-coding gene must be used for an accurate analysis of c. auratus phylogeny, although the first third of the cr is effective and useful for identifying mtdna haplotypes.

evolutionary relationships of east asian c. auratus
the resultant mtdna tree obtained from the  <dig> bp concatenated sequence has important implications for the evolutionary relationships of east asian c. auratus . one important implication is the existence of two old superclades with high regional specificity. superclade a consists of clades i-iii, which are distributed mainly in the japanese main islands, and superclade b consists of clades iv-vii, which are distributed in various regions in and around the eurasian continent. divergence time estimation between superclades a and b using the nprs tree calibrated with the fossil record of c. cuvieri  and cyt b calibration using the molecular clock value of  <dig> % per my  suggests that the two superclades evolved independently for a considerable period of time in the japanese main islands and the eurasian continent, respectively . difference in divergence times estimated by both procedures may be partially explained by the fact that the fossil-based divergence time is the minimum estimation. the japanese main islands are known to have been inhabited by old lineages of various freshwater fishes [e.g., <cit> . superclade a of c. auratus represents one such example of old lineages that is harbored in this island region.

another important implication is the existence of seven clades: three clades  within superclade a and four clades  within superclade b. the seven clades diverged greatly from one another, and their origins were estimated to be old . these clades showed rather high regional specificities . such high regional specificities and ancient origins suggest that each of the seven clades represents the natural population of each region. considering the possibilities of artificial introduction of c. auratus noted below, we concluded that c. auratus with mtdna of each of the clade i-vii haplotypes represents the natural population of honshu , kyushu , honshu + shikoku , the ryukyus , russia + china , taiwan , and china , respectively.

derivation of regional populations
the results of the present study indicate the existence of seven regional endemic populations distributed in honshu, kyushu, honshu + shikoku, the ryukyus, russia + china, taiwan, and china. some individuals belonging to clades ii, iii, vi, and vii, however, were collected from outside the regions specific to these lineages. these individuals could be regarded as offspring of artificially introduced c. auratus for the following reasons:  the occurrence of such individuals was mostly sporadic;  despite the ancient origin of the lineages and their geographic isolation, some individuals shared the same haplotype  with fish from inside their original region; and  in the ryukyus,  <dig> of  <dig>  individuals with haplotypes specific to taiwan and china were collected from water systems with artificial reservoir where freshwater fishes tend to be released. assuming that the individuals collected from outside of the region specific to the lineages were derived from artificial introduction, five introduction routes can be identified: from the eurasian continent to the japanese main islands ; from the eurasian continent to the ryukyus ; from the eurasian continent to taiwan ; from the japanese main islands to the ryukyus ; and from taiwan to the ryukyus . four of the five routes  are supported by the presence of records for past introductions of freshwater fish  <cit> .

a biogeographic perspective of eurasian c. auratus
in the present study, the phylogenetic picture of c. auratus distributed in the eurasian continent was obtained by supertmatrix analysis using the best-scoring ml tree topology as a backbone constraint. this analysis is very useful for estimating phylogenetic relationships among specimens by adding any portion of the dna sequences used in the analysis generating the backbone constraint with a reliable phylogenetic tree topology. based on the results of the analysis, our mtdna tree was judged to be a good reflection of the overall framework of the phylogenetic entity for the carassius fishes around the world because all of the newly downloaded sequences collected from various geographical regions were included in either of the seven major clades detected in our phylogenetic analyses and no other new major lineage was detected . our sampling in east asian regions may sufficiently cover most lineages of c. auratus.

the present supermatrix analysis provided important insights into the origin of european c. auratus. the major haplotypes observed in europe were those of clade v. although a haplotype observed in france might be derived from artificial introduction in that this haplotype was shared by specimens collected from russia, china, and kazakhstan , those observed in the czech republic are considered to be native to europe because these cyt b sequences form a monophyletic lineage , with an estimated divergence time of  <dig>  mya  based on cyt b calibration. clade v is major in eastern eurasia as well, indicating that this clade must have an extensive distribution on the eurasian continent.

all haplotypes other than those of clade v in european c. auratus were nested in japanese native lineages . these clade i and ii haplotypes were found only from the czech republic and greece on the eurasian continent, whereas clade i and ii haplotypes were predominant in the japanese main islands . this distributional disjunction leads to the hypothesis that european fish with these haplotypes originated via artificial introduction from japan. artificial introduction of carassius fishes has been a problem in the european region  <cit> , and release of ornamental goldfish into natural waters is considered to be one of the primary causes of dispersion of non-native c. auratus. however, european c. auratus included in the present study may not have been derived from the release of ornamental goldfish because the goldfish is clearly a member of the chinese c. auratus  and has diverged greatly from specimens of clade i, ii, and v haplotypes . much more sequence data for c. auratus collected throughout eurasia is needed for more detailed phylogenetic and evolutionary pictures of the c. auratus-complex.

phylogeny of triploid c. auratus
our study also has significant implications for the phylogenetic entity of triploid c. auratus. all triploids examined in the present study were female, which is consistent with the idea that triploids reproduce gynogenetically  <cit> . gynogenetic polyploid lineages in fish generally are considered to have arisen by hybridisation between two related bisexual species, and these polyploid lineages usually can be traced to a single or a few maternal founders  <cit> . in fact, most known gynogenetic polyploid fish are confirmed to have originated via hybridisation  <cit> . for triploid c. auratus, some authors have considered the possibility of a hybrid origin, although paternal species were unknown  <cit> . in the present study, however, most triploid c. auratus were sympatric with diploids; they shared the same haplotype with sympatric diploids more frequently than with allopatric triploids . in addition, triploids were not monophyletic, and no substantial genetic separation between triploids and diploids was observed. these results strongly imply multiple origins of triploid c. auratus, as suggested previously  <cit> . our results can be explained if triploids sometimes arise or have arisen recently from sympatric diploids and vice versa.

such interconversion of diploid and triploid forms may be very rare in fish, and only one example is known for cyprinids: the leuciscus alburnoides complex. in this complex, ploidy forms differ from each other in genome constitution, and ploidy interconversion occurs through hybridogenesis  <cit> . whether similar mechanisms also exist in c. auratus is not clear. our preliminary analysis of the nuclear genome of c. auratus suggested that no characteristic exists that distinguishes triploids from diploids  <cit> , whereas other studies have suggested the existence of markers mostly specific to triploids  <cit> . comprehensive investigation of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes should be conducted to clarify the origin of triploids and the process and mechanisms of possible ploidy interconversion in c. auratus.

conservation of endemic lineages of japanese archipelago
as discussed above, at least seven lineages of c. auratus are indigenous to various regions of east asia. the populations of the four endemic lineages  of the japanese archipelago can be regarded as evolutionarily significant units  due to their high phylogenetic independence and evolutionary distinctiveness. therefore, conservation of these lineages is necessary. moreover, note that distribution areas and population sizes of the ryukyuan c. auratus lineage in particular are decreasing rapidly, and some island populations are becoming endangered  <cit> . these reductions appear to be caused mainly by habitat degradation due to simplification of stream morphology through development. to conserve c. auratus populations in the ryukyus, the main stream habitats must be preserved.

artificial introduction of non-native c. auratus may cause another problem: genetic disturbance of native populations. carassius fishes have been artificially introduced both intentionally and unintentionally in several ways  <cit> . in japan, many c. auratus have been imported alive to the ryukyus from taiwan for food . in addition, as suggested by ohara  <cit> , the possibility of accidental introduction of c. auratus exists during seed release of aquacultured fish, such as the japanese crucian carp, c. cuvieri. once c. auratus is introduced into natural waters, either intentionally or unintentionally, genetic disturbance of endemic populations may occur immediately by hybridisation between indigenous and introduced individuals. careless transplantation of c. auratus should be prevented to conserve the genetic uniqueness of the endemic populations.

CONCLUSIONS
phylogenetic analyses based on large data sets of mitochondrial gene sequences  obtained from the east asian carassius auratus-complex revealed the existence of two superlineages, one distributed mainly in the japanese main islands and the other in various regions in and around the eurasian continent. the two superlineages include seven old  lineages endemic to different regions, although some have been affected by artificial introduction of c. auratus from other regions. the present analyses provided an overall phylogenetic framework for c. auratus that can be used in to estimate the phylogenetic relationships of c. auratus on the eurasian continent. triploids of c. auratus did not form a monophyletic lineage but instead clustered mostly with sympatric diploids, indicating that they are not composed of a single independent lineage. the ancient origins and evolutionary uniqueness of these lineages warrant their conservation.
