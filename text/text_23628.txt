BACKGROUND
fusarium ear rot disease of maize, caused by the fungus fusarium verticillioides  nirenberg, is endemic to maize production systems in the united states and worldwide  <cit> . the fungus is present as a symptomless endophyte in most maize seed lots  <cit> ; pathogenic colonization of developing maize kernels is common in the low rainfall high-humidity climates of the southern united states and lowland tropics  <cit> . infection by f. verticillioides can result in decreased grain yield, reduced grain quality, and grain contamination by the mycotoxin fumonisin. fumonisin is a suspected carcinogen and is associated with various diseases in livestock and humans  <cit> . in areas of the world where maize is a dietary staple and occurrence of fusarium ear rot infection is high , consumption of infected grain has been linked to esophageal cancer in adults and growth retardation in children  <cit> .

the most effective method for controlling fusarium ear rot infection and reducing fumonisin contamination is through the deployment of maize hybrids possessing genetic resistance. resistance to the disease is under polygenic control, and no fully immune genotypes have been discovered  <cit> . previous linkage-based and association mapping studies have shown that resistance quantitative trait loci  have relatively small effects and are not consistent between populations  <cit> . the complex nature of resistance has made it difficult for maize breeders to effectively incorporate novel resistance alleles into adapted breeding pools; as a result, most commercial maize hybrids have lower levels of resistance than desired  <cit> . although the heritability of individual plot measures of resistance to fusarium ear rot and fumonisin contamination is low, resistance on an entry mean-basis from replicated bi-parental and diversity panel studies is moderately to highly heritable  <cit> . empirical studies demonstrate that phenotypic selection for improved ear rot resistance can be effective  <cit> . however, most novel sources of disease resistance are unadapted inbreds with poor agronomic performance that often come from tropical or other exotic germplasm pools  <cit> .

genome-wide association studies  can be a powerful tool in the identification of specific allele variants that confer improved resistance to various diseases in maize. utilizing a maize core diversity panel of  <dig> public inbred lines  <cit>  and over  <dig>  snps from the illumina maize 50 k array  <cit> , zila et al.  <cit>  identified three genes associated with improved resistance to fusarium ear rot. however, the three loci associated with improved ear rot resistance all had small allelic effects , and each individual locus was associated between  <dig> to 12% of the observed variation in line means after accounting for the additive polygenic background genetic variance captured by the genomic kinship matrix. the alleles conferring greater resistance at all three loci were at higher frequency in tropical maize than in temperate maize, suggesting that tropical germplasm is a good source of resistance alleles that might not be found easily in elite temperate maize. therefore, further searches for new resistance alleles should target diverse, mostly tropical, maize germplasm.

the usda-ars north central regional plant introduction station  located in ames, ia maintains a large and diverse collection of maize inbred lines that represents a century of public and private maize breeding efforts in the united states and from across the globe  <cit> . within the last year, almost  <dig>  genotype-by-sequencing  markers on  <dig>  accessions from the ncrpis collection have become available through the efforts of romay et al.  <cit> . the availability of this large set of markers on the ncrpis collection provides the opportunity for significantly expanding the sample of maize diversity and the marker density for gwas studies in maize. the objectives of this study were to evaluate  <dig> diverse inbred lines from the ncrpis collection and a subset of their topcross hybrids for resistance to fusarium ear rot across several years and to conduct genome-wide association studies of resistance to this important disease using a set of  <dig>  gbs snps from romay et al.  <cit> .

RESULTS
line means and heritability
significant  genotypic variation for ear rot resistance was observed in both the inbred association panel and topcross experiments. ear rot least squares means among  <dig> entries of the inbred association panel ranged from  <dig> % to 100% with a mean score of  <dig> % . least square means for topcross hybrids ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % with a mean score of  <dig> %. entry mean-basis heritability of ear rot resistance in the full inbred association panel was  <dig> , while in the balanced subset of  <dig> entries all tested across three years it was  <dig> . heritability of topcross rot resistance averaged across testers   <dig> , while heritabilites of resistance within the b <dig> and phz <dig> topcross sets individually were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the genotypic correlations between inbred ear rot resistance and resistance in topcrosses to b <dig> and phz <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the genotypic correlation between performance of b <dig> topcrosses and phz <dig> topcrosses was  <dig> . on an inbred per se basis, b <dig> had a mean ear rot score of  <dig> %, whereas phz <dig> had a mean score of  <dig> % .table  <dig>

when the analysis was conducted on a filtered data set including only lines with data from all three years, a distinct set of five snps, all on chromosome  <dig>  were identified as significantly associated with ear rot resistance . no significant snps at fdr <  <dig>  were identified from either the b <dig> topcross analysis or the phz <dig> topcross analysis , where the minimum raw p-values among snp association tests were  <dig>  × 10− <dig> and  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  respectively.figure  <dig>

snps identified from either of the two inbred analyses explained relatively small proportions of the observed variance in entry means after accounting for the background polygenic effects , and each snp also had a small allelic effect . all significant associations had negative allelic effects, indicating that the minor allele was associated with lower ear rot  at all loci.

the frequency of disease resistance alleles were estimated at the seven significantly associated snps in the same five major maize subpopulations analyzed by zila et al.  <cit>  – stiff stalk temperate , non-stiff stalk temperate , tropical/subtropical , popcorn , and sweet corn   <cit> . alleles associated with increased disease resistance at all seven snp loci were significantly  overrepresented in the tropical and/or popcorn groups compared to the three other temperate groups . disease resistance alleles at all seven snp loci were absent or nearly absent in the ss, nss, and sc subpopulations. however, examination of the average of least squares means across lines sampled within a subpopulation showed no major difference in disease severity between the groups, largely agreeing with the principal component analysis of the k matrix .table  <dig>

genes colocalized with associated snps
to gauge the resolution of associations, we inspected the local ld structure around the significant associations . romay et al.  <cit>  summarized the genome-wide ld characteristics of this panel, noting that ld tends to decay rapidly to below r2 =  <dig>  within 1 kb, but that there is substantial variation around this average value among genome regions and germplasm groups. the regions around our associations on chromosome  <dig> near 125 mb and on chromosome  <dig> exhibit the typical rapid decay of ld observed in diverse maize. ld was slightly more extensive around the chromosome  <dig> association, with a few snps about 200 kb away from the significant association having r <dig> of about  <dig>  with the associated snp. finally, the region on chromosome  <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb had the most extensive ld, with snps separated by almost 2 mb still having high ld, although much of the region between the ends of this section had much lower ld. romay et al.  <cit>  observed that chromosome  <dig> has particularly high ld. the high ld region reported here is coincident with the interval containing the gametophyte factor  <dig>  locus  <cit> , which is under selection in the popcorn subgroup and may also be more widespread in tropical maize due to selfish gene evolution  <cit> . these selection effects associated with ga <dig> may be involved in maintaining ld in the region.figure  <dig>

genes containing snps significantly associated with ear rot resistance were characterized using the filtered predicted gene set from the annotated b <dig> reference genome  <cit>  . all seven snps identified across both inbred association panel analyses were within predicted genes on the maize physical map, five of the seven localized to exons , one to the 3′ untranslated region, and one to an intron . the disease associated snp on chromosome  <dig> was in a sucrose synthase gene  located in an ld block extending approximately  <dig>  mbp on chromosome  <dig> . examination of the lines carrying the minor allele at this locus revealed no relationship between population structure due to kernel type  and presence of the minor allele. the associated snp on chromosome  <dig> was in a dna replication factor cdt1-like gene  located at the end of a  <dig>  mbp ld block on chromosome  <dig> . all five snps identified in the balanced subset of the inbred association panel analysis were located on chromosome  <dig> . four of those snps were located in a  <dig>  mbp region between physical positions  <dig> ,354 bp and  <dig> ,851 bp, representing a region of high linkage disequilibrium covering a genetic distance of less than 1 cm  . the four snps in this region were all in high ld relationships with each other . two of the snps in this region localized to an exon of an f-box domain gene, one localized to a thioredoxin gene, and the last localized to a gene of no known function . the fifth snp identified on chromosome  <dig> located at position  <dig> ,006 bp localized to an exon of a loricrin-related gene .

discussion
heritability and genotypic correlation between experiments
the removal of lines that were not tested in all three years  substantially improved the entry mean-basis heritability. . this large difference in heritability provided justification for conducting separate gwas on the complete and filtered inbred association panel data sets. improved heritability of the mean values from the filtered panel will contribute to increased power of gwas  <cit> , but this is balanced by the loss of diversity and reduced allele replication in the subset compared to the complete set of inbreds. analyses on the full versus filtered inbred data sets identified different genomic regions significantly associated with fusarium ear rot resistance . these differing results presumably reflect the tradeoffs between higher heritability and larger sample size that affect gwas power.

although the heritability estimate for ear rot resistance averaged across testers in the topcross experiment h^c= <dig>  was comparable to that of the filtered inbred data set, no snps were identified as being significantly associated with ear rot resistance in either the b <dig> or phz <dig> topcross data sets. estimates of genetic variance in the heritability calculations revealed reduced genetic variance in the topcross experiment compared to the inbred experiments . smaller genotypic sample size of the topcross experiment also contributes to reduced power of detection of snp associations. in addition, genotypic correlations between inbred per se resistance and hybrid performance in the two sets of topcrosses were moderately low .

association mapping
two snps significantly associated with ear rot resistance, located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were identified in the full inbred association panel analysis, and five additional snps  were identified on chromosome  <dig> in the filtered inbred panel analysis . although all snps localized to genic regions, no obvious relationship exists between the predicted functions of these genes and fusarium ear rot resistance; however the currently limited understanding of pathways contributing to resistance restricts our ability to predict what genes might be involved in resistance to this complex disease.

these snp associations are different than those previously reported by zila et al.  <cit>  based on analysis a subset of  <dig> lines with a smaller and largely distinct set of snps. the closest pair of associations between the two studies were the snps on chromosome  <dig>  which localized to the same genomic bin; however, they are  <dig> mbp distant from each other physically, and  <dig>  cm apart genetically  <cit> . the differences between the results presented here and those reported by zila et al.  <cit>  may be due to sample size and sampling of alleles and also due to differences in the snps tested for association. none of the three snps reported as associated with ear rot resistance by zila et al.  <cit> , located on chromosomes  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , were present in the filtered gbs romay et al.  <cit>  marker set, and thus we had no potential to detect them in this study. the nearest neighboring filtered gbs snp to each of the three snps reported by zila et al.  <cit>  were located 82 bp , 2902 bp , and 299 bp away , respectively. however, the chromosome  <dig> snp from the zila et al.  <cit>  study located was present in the original unfiltered romay et al.  <cit>  marker set, but a follow-up analysis of this single marker in gapit using the full inbred panel found it insignificant . finally, only the three snps in the ld block from  <dig>  –  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> in this analysis colocalized with any qtl intervals identified in two biparental families by robertson-hoyt et al.  <cit> . qtl positions for fusarium ear rot are not consistent among biparental families  <cit> , but this one qtl region on chromosome  <dig> was exceptional in being identified by linkage in two families by robertson-hoyt et al.  <cit>  and by association in this study.

the variability in snp association results among different germplasm samples may be due in part to the relatively small effect sizes of the potentially many underlying causal variations, coupled with low frequency of many variants and rapid decay of ld in diverse maize germplasm. this could result in a situation where even snps physically close to a causal variant are not likely to be associated with enough phenotypic effect to permit their robust and reliable detection through association analysis in diverse populations. the high frequency of detection of the chromosome  <dig> snp , and the consistency of its effect even in the filtered subsample , suggest that its association in very diverse maize is reliable.

the five snps on chromosome  <dig> that were detected in the filtered but not the complete inbred panel had substantially higher allele effect estimates in the filtered panel, but similar allele frequencies across panels . the difference in these results may be due to a reduction in the influence of many line means with only a single environment observation associated with a lower heritability in the full inbred line panel, and possibly greater precision of the resulting allele effect estimates. in contrast, the two snps detected in the full panel had consistent allele frequencies and effect estimates across the two analyses, but simply did not have sufficient statistical significance to stand out among the hundreds of thousands of tests performed .

although this study used four times the number of snp markers  and an association panel almost six times as large as those used by zila et al.  <cit> , the number of genic regions identified as significantly associated with ear rot was about the same for the two studies . furthermore, the proportion of phenotypic variance among entry means explained on average by the k matrix across the two inbred analyses and two topcross analyses was similar to results reported by zila et al.  <cit> . these results suggest that the genetic architecture of resistance to fusarium ear rot is highly polygenic, with substantial genetic variability generated by a large number of effective variants, each with individually small effects. even with increased marker coverage and a larger association panel, the results of this study highlight the limitations of gwas to precisely identify allele variants with small effects on complex traits.

marker coverage in this study is still insufficient to provide snps in high ld with all segregating sequence variants; romay et al.  <cit>  suggested that more than  <dig>  snps would be required to tag almost all variant regions in diverse maize. examination of the annotated genes around the significant associations reveals a number of genes nearby that contain no snps in our data set , suggesting that we are likely to miss some true associations. thus, it is possible that a further increase in marker density might reveal more snp associations and possibly some genetic variants with larger effects. however, if the genetic architecture really is highly polygenic, then the benefit of increasing marker density on increasing the likelihood of tagging additional causal variations by ld association is likely to offset by the increasingly stringent significance thresholds imposed by the larger number of association tests conducted. the additional benefit of adding markers is also somewhat limited if most of the markers have low minor allele frequency , as is the case for the gbs markers used here  <cit> . the snp associations detected in this study had minor allele frequencies ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , compared to minor allele frequencies below  <dig>  for more than half of the complete gbs marker set. besides having low power of detection just due to reduced allele replication, rare alleles tend to be highly associated with population structure since they are usually limited to a single subpopulation, thereby further reducing their potential for trait association following correction for population structure. in this study, we removed snps with maf <  <dig>  to ensure reliable associations based on sufficient replication across lines. if rare alleles are a major component of the genetic architecture, however, we may have missed many important associations by dropping snps with low allele frequencies that would represent the best possible associations with rare functional alleles. further studies would be required to better understand the compromises between improving reliability of results by removing rare snps versus potentially missing important but rare functional variants.

no significant snps were identified in either topcross analysis, and examination of the empirical distribution of p-values from the four analyses revealed a tendency towards higher p-values in the two topcross analyses compared to the two inbred panel analyses . heterosis plays a significant part in fusarium ear rot resistance, reducing both genetic variance and the mean level of disease in f <dig> hybrids compared to inbred parents  <cit> , which can reduce the ability to discriminate levels of disease resistance in topcross hybrids. further, within a set of hybrids created from crosses to a common tester, each topcross hybrid has an equal contribution of half of its alleles at all loci from the common tester, which also reduces genetic variation among the hybrids. the reduction of genetic variance, along with the smaller sample sizes, reduced the power of detection in hybrids relative to inbreds.

candidate genes for fusarium ear rot resistance
genetic and biochemical pathways leading to resistance to fusarium ear rot are entirely unknown. therefore, gwas provides a forward genetics approach to screen efficiently many thousands of genes for association with the phenotype without requiring assumptions about what gene functions might be involved in resistance. the snp associations reported here may help suggest and prioritize candidate genes for resistance to fusarium ear rot, although we emphasize that associations between genetic variants and phenotypes do not imply that either the snp is a functional variant or even that the gene containing the snp is causally involved in resistance. independent studies, particularly focusing on the biology of the gene functions in relation to infection of maize seeds or other plant tissues, will be required to determine if any of the genes identified here have a role in fusarium ear rot resistance. conversely, we expect that gwas was unable to identify some true functional variants because of the combined effects of small effect size, allele frequency, limited ld in maize, and insufficient snp density.

the genes containing significant snp associations in this study include a thioredoxin gene, an f-box gene, a loricrin gene, a sucrose synthase, a ctd <dig> gene, and a gene of unknown function. the common theme among the likely functions of these genes is that they are very generally important for a variety of cellular processes. the thioredoxin protein family is involved in redox signaling for nearly every plant cellular process  <cit> ; f-box genes are one of the most abundant gene superfamilies in plants and their protein products are involved in uniquitination and degradation  <cit> ; loricrin is likely to be involved in cell membrane function, sucrose synthase is a key enzyme in plant metabolism, and ctd <dig> is involved in dna replication. because of the generality and importance of these gene classes, variation in their function is expected to affect a variety of cellular mechanisms, complicating their possible functional relationship to fusarium ear rot resistance. thus, our ignorance of the pathways to resistance to fusarium suggests that the gene containing a snp association but no known function should have similar priority for further research as the other candidate genes.

in addition to the genes containing the associated snps, there are some cases where ld appears to be sufficiently extensive as to suggest other genes in the region may be important. around the associations reported between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  for example, it is clear that snps in a number of genes across this nearly 2 mb region are in high ld and will share the association signal with the functional variant in this region. there is a nearby cluster of defense-related and wound-induced proteins around  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb that might be considered as putative candidates for further research. two of those genes had no snps in our data set, so we cannot test their associations directly with these data. a few other genes very close to some of significant association also lacked snps for testing , and these could not be ruled out as potential candidates. outside of the region on the short of chromosome  <dig>  however, the ld decay appears so rapid that it seems unlikely that the snp associations are more than a few kb from a functional variant. finally, we also note that there are some larger intergenic regions that lack snps , and some sequence variation in these regions may impact gene regulation important to ear rot resistance, but we are likely to miss many such variants in our gwas scan.

CONCLUSIONS
zila et al.  <cit>  suggested that gwas could be a useful tool for identifying specific disease resistance allele variants in unadapted maize germplasm, thereby allowing maize breeders to more effectively introgress specific allele variants into adapted germplasm. however, the small effects of resistance loci identified in this study and zila et al.  <cit>  suggest that introgressing a few specific resistance loci may not have a large overall impact on resistance levels within temperate breeding populations. directly targeting low frequency snp alleles, particularly when they are harbored in unadapted subpopulations like the tropical and popcorn populations identified both here and by zila et al.  <cit> , combined with genomic selection for the polygenic background for both the target trait and general adaptation traits , however, may be a useful compromise to leverage the benefits of both approaches to prediction and selection, although the effectiveness of such schemes will depend in part on the targeted snps having a consistent association with a significant proportion of genotypic variation  <cit> .
