BACKGROUND
pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum is a phytopathogenic enterobacterium responsible for soft rot, a disease characterized by extensive plant tissue maceration caused by a variety of secreted enzymes. the major pathogenicity determinants are an arsenal of extracellular pectinases, including several pectate lyase isozymes: pectin lyase, pectin methylesterase, and pectin polygalacturonase. in addition, a range of other degradative enzymes, such as cellulase and proteases, play equivocal roles in virulence  <cit> . pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum also produces one or more antibacterial substances called bacteriocins, which enhance their competitiveness with other related rival species  <cit> . the ability of this bacterial species to produce bacteriocin has been exploited in many biological control programs for the soft-rot disease of chinese cabbage  <cit> . in view of this, identification and cloning of the gene controlling bacteriocin production may facilitate the development of wider and more innovative control methods, such as the cloning of these gene into chinese cabbage, tobacco, and other susceptible plants to produce resistant cultivars.

in our previous paper, the brg gene was found to encode a regulator required for the expression of the low-molecular-weight bacteriocin  in a strain of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum  <cit> . the gene is homologous to hfq and encodes a protein with similar functions  <cit> . the genetic determinant encoding lmwb synthesis was designated the carocin s <dig> genetic determinant, which consists of two structural genes, caros1k  and caros1i . clear zones of inhibition around caros1k producer colonies are due to caros1k antibiotic activity. carocin s1-associated nuclease activity has also been demonstrated  <cit> . the carocin s <dig> gene has been isolated from pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum 89-h- <dig> and functionally expressed after introduction into pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum ea1068a . from our previous studies, glucose, as well as sos agents, can also induce the carocin s <dig> gene.

using the same carocin s1-producing strain of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, genes controlling the lmwb have been cloned and sequenced, and homology to the flhd/c operon demonstrated. the flhd/c operon is a regulator that activates expression of genes required for flagella assembly. however, its activity depends on environmental stimuli , cell division, flagella formation, and motility  <cit> .

a number of gram-negative pathogenic bacteria have evolved a specialized type iii protein secretion system to deliver effector virulence proteins into host cells  <cit> . there are two types of type iii secretion systems: the translocation-associated type iii secretion system  and the bacterial flagellum type iii secretion system . the various bacterial type iii secretion systems characterized thus far all have sec independence, atpase dependence, presence of a hollow filamentous organelle that extends from the outer membrane, a cell-envelope-spanning secretion channel, and nine conserved proteins  <cit> .

the bacterial flagellum type iii secretion system also serves as the bacterial flagellum . for the flagellum, the t3bss apparatus functions to secrete components including the rod, hook, and filament subunits for extracellular assembly. the core of the flagellum is hollow, and secreted subunits polymerize at the growing end of the flagellum. a cap at the tip of the flagellum ensures efficient polymerization of secreted subunit proteins  <cit> . this secretion apparatus is just one mechanism utilized by gram-negative plant and animal pathogens for the secretion and translocation of virulence determinants into susceptible eukaryotic cells  <cit> . in salmonella typhimurium, the expression of class  <dig> genes  activates expression of genes required for flagella assembly and regulates expression class  <dig> genes , which in turn regulates expression of class  <dig> genes encoding flagellar structural proteins   <cit> . in xenorhabdus nematophila, it was shown that the envz-ompr-flhdc-flia regulatory network coordinately controls flagella synthesis as well as exoenzyme and antibiotic production  <cit> .

in this paper, we describe the transcriptional regulation of flic and flha expression by flhd/c and also show that flhd/c has an effect on extracellular secretion of the carocin s <dig> protein, but not on carocin s <dig> gene expression. our results indicate that the type iii secretion system of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum has a new secretory function.

subcloning of flhd/c dna from h-rif-8-6
the dna fragment of flhd/c was amplified by pcr from h-rif-8- <dig> using oligonucleotide primers dy-sf <dig> and dy-sr <dig>  the flhd/c dna containing product was digested with restriction enzymes clai and ecori and subcloned into plasmid pbr <dig>  the new plasmid was designated pbyl2dc. one hundred transformed colonies were isolated using selective lb agar containing  <dig> μg/ml of ampicillin after the transfer of pbyl2dc into e. coli dh <dig>  the presence of the flhd/c dna was detected by colony hybridization using flhd/c dna probes and electrophoresis after digestion with clai and ecori to yield the expected  <dig> -kb dna fragment bearing flhd/c. the pbyl2dc dna was isolated from dh05/pbyl2dc and transferred into the insertion mutants of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum th12- <dig>  one hundred colonies were isolated by selection on modified drigalski's medium containing  <dig> μg/ml of kanamycin, rifampicin, and ampicillin. the flhd/c dna was detected as previously described.

construction of the null alleles of flhd, flic, and flha genes
the flhd gene was isolated from pbyl2dc by digesting with bsmi, which cleaves at two sites in pbyl2dc and thereby conveniently deletes flhc from the operon. the resulting plasmid was designated pbyl2d. a kanamycin resistant gene from pacyc <dig> was isolated, made blunt-ended using a dna-blunting kit , and inserted in the unique ecorv site of the flhd gene. the resulting plasmid was designated pbyl2d-kan. the pbyl2d-kan was re-isolated and linearized after hpai and sspi restriction enzyme digestion, which deleted the ampicillin resistance gene and replication site of the plasmid. the linearized construct was transferred into h-rif-8- <dig>  resulting in the homologous replacement of the native flhd gene and generating a null allele.

the dna fragment of flic was amplified by pcr from h-rif-8- <dig>  after pcr amplification using two oligonucleotide primers , the partial flic dna fragment was purified, digested using ahdi and hindiii, and subcloned into plasmid pbr <dig> to generate the flic plasmid. a kanamycin resistant gene from pacyc <dig> was isolated, made blunt-ended, and inserted into the unique sali site of the flic gene. the resulting plasmid was designated pflic-kan. the pflic-kan was linearized after ahdi and hindiii restriction enzyme digestion, which deleted the ampicillin resistance gene and replication site of the plasmid. the linearized construct was transferred into h-rif-8- <dig> resulting in the homologous replacement of the native flic gene and generating a null allele.

the dna fragment of flha was amplified by pcr from h-rif-8- <dig> using oligonucleotide primers flha-sen and flha-anti. the partial flha dna fragment was purified, digested using the restriction enzymes clai and ecori, and subcloned into plasmid pbr <dig> using t <dig> ligase to generate the flha plasmid. a kanamycin resistant gene from pacyc <dig> was isolated, made blunt-ended, and inserted in the unique sali site of the flha gene. the resulting plasmid was designated pflha-kan.

computer analysis of sequence data
the nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino-acid sequence of flhd/c were compared using the blast and fasta programs of the national center for biotechnology information server. sequence data were compiled by dnasis-mac software .

rna preparation and northern hybridization
bacteriocin synthesis medium  was used to produce carocin s <dig>  total rna was extracted from cells  that were grown without drugs at 28°c. to determine the stability of h-rif-8- <dig>  th12- <dig>  th12-2/pbyl2c, kh <dig>  and kh17/pbyl2d strains, culture samples  were withdrawn at various time points and transferred to tubes containing  <dig> ml of ice-cold water. total rna was extracted using trizol  according to the manufacturer's protocol.

northern blot hybridizations were performed using  <dig> μg of total rna. rna samples were denatured in rna sample buffer at 65°c for  <dig> min. the buffer consisted of  <dig> μl formamide,  <dig> μl of 37%  formaldehyde,  <dig> μl of 6× loading dye ,  <dig> μl of 10× morpholinepropanesulfonic acid  buffer,  <dig> mm edta , and  <dig> μl of distilled water. rna samples were separated on 1% agarose gels containing mops buffer with 2%  formaldehyde. dna probes were synthesized by pcr using specific oligonucleotides : pcar-r <dig> , pflhc-r <dig> , and pflhd  derived from pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum . template dnas  were obtained by pcr amplification. the probes were nonradioactively labeled by random priming using a digoxigenin  high prime kit . to add the correct amount of probe for hybridization, a serial dilution of each probe  was spotted on a nylon membrane, and the labeling sensitivity  was determined. rna was transferred overnight to a positively charged nylon membrane  by capillary transfer using 20× ssc . the membrane after hybridization  was washed, and the specific transcripts on the blots were detected using a dig luminescence detection kit  according to the manufacturer's protocol.

motility test
a sterile loopful of bacterial cells was carefully inoculated vertically into tubes containing soft agar . after incubation for one month, motility was determined by migration and/or outgrowth of bacterial cells from the original inoculation line.

RESULTS
isolation of transposon insertion mutants
conjugation of strain h-rif-8- <dig> with e. coli  <dig> led to the isolation of  <dig> colonies that grew on the selective plates containing  <dig> μg/ml rifampicin and kanamycin. their antibiotic resistance was ascertained by rechecking growth on the selective medium and was found to be a stable property.

bacteriocin assay of tn <dig> insertional mutants
the bacteriocin activity of the putative insertion mutants was examined. the diameters of the inhibition zone typical were smaller around the putative mutant strains than parental strains, indicating the possibility that a gene related to carocin s <dig> production had been inserted into the tn <dig> transposon .

detection of tn <dig> insertions in the mutants
to ascertain whether a tn <dig> insertion had actually occurred in the putative mutant strains, nested-pcr was used to amplify the nptii gene  <cit>  using the oligonucleotide primers p- <dig> and p- <dig> . a total of 97% of the test isolates but not h-rif-8- <dig> produced a 500-bp dna fragment that did not harbor the tn <dig> insertion. southern blot hybridization confirmed these results .

amplification of the dna at the tn <dig> insertion junction site and sequence analysis
tail-pcr was used to analyze the dna sequences at the junctions of the tn <dig> insertions. after the first tail-pcr experiment, two or more differently sized dna fragments were obtained from each sample. all fragments were isolated by electrophoresis, purified, and sequenced and corresponding dna fragments were shown to have the same sequence. based on the sequence obtained from the first tail-pcr experiment, specific primers  were synthesized for a second tail-pcr experiment. subsequently, a nucleotide sequence of  <dig> base pairs was obtained. the direction of transcription determined by analysis of the tn <dig> insertions showed that two complete open reading frames  were present and that tn <dig> was located in orf <dig> between base pairs  <dig> and  <dig>  the 3' end of another open reading frame, orf <dig>  was located upstream of orf <dig>  and the 5' end of orf <dig> was located downstream from orf <dig> .

homology with other genes and proteins
the predicted amino-acid sequences of orf <dig> and orf <dig> were compared to other known genes using the swiss-prot protein sequence data bank. a significant similarity was found between orf <dig> and orf <dig> of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and the flhd and flhc genes, respectively, of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atroseptica , serratia marcescens , yersinia enterocolitica , and e. coli . thus, orf <dig> was designated as flhd, and orf <dig> as flhc.

bacteriocin expression, isolation, and activity assay
bacteria in bsm medium were incubated in a sterilized stainless steel box with a stainless steel cover at 28°c for  <dig> h without any light. after centrifugation, the extracellular solution and cells were separated and collected. the cells were homogenized by sonication, and ammonium sulfate was added to 80% saturation to precipitate the protein. the precipitate was collected on a  <dig> -μm cellulose filter. one milligram of precipitated protein was dissolved in  <dig> μl of bacteriocin buffer . to determine bacteriocin antibiotic activity,  <dig> μg/ <dig> μl of the caros1k protein solution was added to an indicator plate containing the ea <dig> strain growing on soft ifo- <dig> medium containing  <dig> % agar. growth inhibition zones at the point of addition were considered an indication of carocin s <dig> activity .

isolation of null alleles of the flhd, flic, and flha genes
since flagella assembly requires the expression of both the flhd and flhc genes, we constructed the strain flhd-ko . the linearized construct  was transferred into h-rif-8- <dig>  resulting in the homologous replacement of the native flhd gene and generating a null allele. the resultant kan and rif resistant transformants were screened by pcr with one set of primers  representing the 5' and the 3' termini of the flhd/c operon. this set of primers generated a  <dig> -kb product, if the transforming dna was not integrated. however, a homologous replacement of the native flhd gene by the null allele yielded a  <dig> -kb product. the observed pcr product was  <dig>  kb, indicating that the flhd gene had been replaced by the null allele. the gene was therefore designated as Δflhd .

to confirm that carocin s <dig> was actually secreted via t3bss, we selected two components of t3bss for deletion analysis, the flic and flha genes. the flic gene encodes a flic protein, which is an outer membrane component of t3bss. the linearized construct  was transferred into h-rif-8- <dig>  resulting in the homologous replacement of the native flic gene and generating a null allele. the kan and rif resistant transformants were screened by pcr with one set of primers  representing the 5' and the 3' termini of the flic operon. the gene was therefore designated as Δflic . the flagellin-associated gene flha encodes the inner membrane flha component of t3bss. the same procedure was used to obtain the flha knockout  mutant, and the gene was designated Δflha .

complementation and analysis of flhd, flhc, flic, and flha genes
wild-type h-rif-8- <dig> was used as a control and transformed with plasmids containing the flhd  and flhc  genes as well as the flhd/c  operon. the effect of these transformations on the bacteriocin production and cell size of the wild-type strain was assessed. the mutations in the flhc gene  and the Δflhd  gene were complemented by introduction of the flhd+, flhc+, and flhd/c  genes, and the effects of these respective genes were evaluated .

plasmids pbyl2dc , pbyl2c , pbyl2d , pbfc , and pbfa  were expressed from their own native promoters in pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum th12- <dig>  kh <dig>  flic-ko, and flha-ko strains. northern blot analysis of total rna from h-rif-8- <dig>  th12- <dig>  th12-2/pbyl2c, kh <dig>  kh17/pbyl2d, flic-ko/pbfc, and flha-ko/pbfa cells incubated in bsm medium at 28°c for  <dig> h. pcr products specific for flhd, flhc, flic, flha, and caros1k were used as probes in the hybridizations. the data indicate the presence of caros1k gene in all strains and the presence of the other genes in all strains except the uncomplemented mutants, as expected .

bacteriocin activity assay for complementation
assay of bacteriocin secreted from the insertion mutants, with and without complementation, indicated that, after complementation, mutants recovered the ability to secrete lmwb. their larger inhibition zones were comparable in diameter to those of their parent strain, h-rif-8- <dig> . neither the kh <dig> nor th12- <dig> strains could secrete carocin s <dig>  however, complementation , respectively, rescued the ability of these strains to secrete carocin s <dig> and thereby increased inhibition zone diameters, which were comparable in size to that of wild type. after transformation, all deletion strains harboring their respective complementing plasmids secreted lmwb .

motility
the wild-type strain, h-rif-8- <dig>  but not the transposon insertion mutant, th12- <dig>  was motile . the motility of th12- <dig> was restored by transformation with the flhc  and flhd/c  genes.

discussion
in this study, the sequences of the flhd and flhc genes from pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum were highly homologous to the reported sequences of flhd/c genes in other bacterial strains  <cit> . these genes are adjacent and appear to share the same promoter  <cit> . cloning of the flhd/c gene and subsequent transfer into the insertion mutant th12- <dig>  resulted in the recovery of bacteriocin activity  in this mutant. the homologous replacement of the flhd gene by its null allele also resulted in the inhibition of carocin s <dig> production. this indicated that both flhd and flhc are required for the production of carocin s <dig> and, therefore, that the entire flhd/c operon influences the production of carocin s <dig>  flhd has been previously shown to be associated with other stress-response systems  <cit> . interestingly, flagella formation is controlled by the flhd/c operon  <cit> . in gram-negative bacteria, the flagellar system is also known as the type iii bacterium-flagella secretion system. expression of the flhd/c genes is a form of response to environmental stress and requires the heat shock proteins dnak, dnaj, and grpe  <cit> , which are all related to environmental stress. furthermore, the microcin b <dig>  promoter is positively regulated by flhd  <cit> . it is therefore entirely appropriate to suggest that carocin s <dig>  which is normally induced by stress inducers like uv light and high competition from other related bacterial strains, is also under the control of flhd/c.

although flhd/c was shown to control extracellular protein production through cumulative effects on hexa and gaca expression, this result was only demonstrated at the level of rna transcription  <cit> . in this study, both the flhc and flhd genes regulated carocin s <dig> secretion but not the transcription of the lmwb mrna, caros1k. furthermore, assay of bacteriocin activity from th12- <dig>  detected intracellular but not extracellular carocin s <dig> protein . similarly, we also found the transposon tn <dig> insertion mutant, th12- <dig> , lost the ability to produce lmwb . northern blot analysis to monitor the expression of the caros1k and flic genes in the th12- <dig> and kh <dig> strains detected the expression of caros1k mrna but not expression of flic mrna . however, as mentioned above, flhd/c genes regulate gram-negative flagella synthesis and cell motility.

these results suggest that the flhd/c genes regulate the synthesis of bacterial flagella, which function as a flagellar type iii secretion system  in gram-negative bacteria, and that carocin s <dig> utilizes this secretion machinery in pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. however, because the growth of th12- <dig>  was extremely poor, this strain was lost before further experiments could be conducted. to further support our hypothesis, homologous replacement of the flic gene  and the flha gene  was used to generate a flic null allele and flha null allele, respectively. bacteriocin analysis of extracellular fluids from the flic-ko  and flha-ko  strains also indicated significant inhibition of lmwb secretion. these results were similar to those found for th12- <dig>  importantly, all these mutants still expressed the caros1k mrna.

the above results suggest a new function for the type iii secretory system in this bacterial strain. interestingly, complementation analysis of the flic and flha genes sometimes produced a smaller bacteriocin inhibition zone . these results indicated that although the flic and flha genes are expressed in the flic-ko/pbfc and flha-ko/pbfa strains, the secretion of the caros1k protein is not as efficient as in the wild-type strain, h-rif-8- <dig>  in this study, the flic and flha genes were inserted into flic-ko and flha-ko cells using multicopy plasmids for overexpression. it is therefore possible that the flic or flha protein is not efficiently recruited into the t3bss, and consequently caros1k cannot be secreted competently. interestingly, the results of flhg  <cit>  and flic  <cit>  gene complementation are similar to those found in our studies. these studies also support our hypothesis.

in previous studies, just one mechanism was utilized by gram-negative plant and animal pathogens for t3bss secretion and translocation of virulence determinants into susceptible eukaryotic cells  <cit> . the present study uniquely demonstrates that pectobacterium cells can transfer carocin s <dig> extracellularly using the t3bss system and kill related bacterial cells.

the observed smaller size of flhd mutant cells confirms the observation of prüss and matsumura  <cit>  and corroborates the suggestion that flhd is responsible for cell elongation. interestingly, th12- <dig>  cells are longer , which indicates that flhc also controls cell elongation. this is similar to what was observed in brg insertion mutants  <cit> , indicating a possible interference with or disruption of cell division. this is directly opposite to what was observed in flhd mutants. it could therefore be proposed that though flhd inhibits cell division  <cit> , flhc may promote cell division in this bacterial strain. therefore, the flhc gene may have functions unrelated to its role in the flagellar regulon, which may be opposite to that of flhd. however, both flhd and flhc are required for determining bacterial cell size.

CONCLUSIONS
based on these results, we conclude that the extracellular export of lmwb, carocin s <dig>  by pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum utilizes the type iii secretion system, which also controls this bacterium's cell motility and cell size.
