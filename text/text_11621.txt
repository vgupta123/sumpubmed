BACKGROUND
all organelle genomes found in mitochondria of plant or animal cells are considered to have originated from an endosymbiotic form of Î±-proteobacteria, and given rise to the emerging eukaryotic cell more than  <dig> years ago  <cit> . despite their monophyletic origin, animal and plant mitochondrial genomes  exhibit contrasted features, when considering size, compactness, mutation rate and gene-order variation  <cit> . most animal mitogenomes are circular and compact, share the same gene content and have a size that does not exceed  <dig> kb. the high nucleotide mutation rate of their coding sequences has been commonly used in population genetic and phylogenetic studies  <cit> . however, in taxonomic studies, the introduction of gene-order variation to resolve specific nodes has proved to be a powerful tool  <cit> . in these animal rearranged mitogenomes, most gene rearrangements were due to inversions and translocations. but duplication events were also identified: in some cases, they were distant in the genomes, with or without loss of parts of the duplicated fragment  <cit> . in other cases, duplications occurred in tandem repeat and were followed either by non-random duplicate loss  or by random loss   <cit> . in most cases, when duplication involved a protein coding gene, only one functional copy remained.

in contrast, plant mitogenomes exhibit larger size  and are less compact than their animal counterparts due to the occurrence of non-coding sequences and duplicated fragments. moreover, plant mitogenomes are known to evolve rapidly in structure and slowly in sequence  <cit> . the occurrence of large repeated sequences has led to the idea of a complex genome, composed of alternative master chromosomes and sub-genomic molecules due to intragenomic recombination  <cit> , even though whole sequenced genomes are usually represented as circular master circles  <cit> . at the intra-specific level, recombination through small repeat sequences is believed to be responsible for large gene-order shuffling and the emergence of new open reading frames, some of which have been involved in cytoplasmic male sterility   <cit> . in this context, the acquisition of whole sequence data for several mitogenomes found in a species opens new venues toward a better understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of this peculiar genome, especially when focusing on its high structural rearrangement rate and the origin of duplicated fragments.

the comparison of whole genomes using gene order has been an active field of research since the early 1990s. the first methods focused on the study of the minimal number of rearrangement events, mostly inversions, to go from one genome to another  <cit> . the resulting scenario could be seen as a putative evolutionary scenario. phylogenetic reconstruction methods based on rearrangement events have also been proposed in order to compute scenarios and putative ancestors for a set of genomes  <cit> . methods to study rearrangements that take duplicates into account have been investigated over the past decade. since most of the mathematical models used to compute rearrangement distances and scenarios are based on the assumption that each gene or synteny block appears exactly once in each genome, methods designed for genomes without duplicates cannot be applied directly to plant mitochondrial genomes. one possible approach consists in keeping only one of the duplicates and removing the others from the genomes in order to obtain a dataset with one copy of each gene per genome  <cit> . the drawback of this solution is its high combinatorics if the number of duplicates is large. moreover it does not provide any kind of explanation about duplication events. other methods focus on the study of gene families, i.e. the evolutionary history of a gene and its duplicates  <cit> . the aim of these methods is to find the duplication events within a given phylogenetic tree. it follows that currently no method is able to reconstruct a rearrangement phylogenetic tree of genomes with duplicates. therefore the 'manual approach' has to be used for resolving this type of evolutionary history  <cit> .

recently, allen and colleagues  <cit>  reported the whole sequencing of  <dig> mitogenomes in maize. as expected, the mitogenomes exhibited a large variation in size  due mainly to large duplicated fragments, and gene shuffling was such that no clear evolutionary scenario could be pictured. however, on the basis of nucleotide divergence, groups of related mitogenomes could be defined and qualified as ancestral or derived though no phylogeny could be established. in the present study, we added three newly available whole mitogenome sequences of teosintes, species that are relatives of maize, to the five mitogenomes studied by allen and colleagues  <cit>  in order to conduct a phylogenetic analysis and ultimately comprehend the events that led to their structural features: sequence order and duplicates.

the analysis based on sequence polymorphism among the eight mitogenomes enabled us to build a robust reference tree for subsequent analyses solely based on genome structure information . we showed that mitogenome rearrangements could result from a mechanism similar to that found in animals, i.e. tandem duplication, but where some duplicates were partially lost. using this evolution model, we developed a methodology to reconstruct a phylogeny based on rearrangement events that integrated most duplicates, and ended up with an evolutionary scenario of the mitochondrial genome in maize.

RESULTS
genome duplications
the analysis of maize and teosinte mitogenomes revealed the occurrence of duplications. duplication length varied from  <dig>  kbp to  <dig> kbp . duplicated fragments were an important part of the total genome length for the longest genomes,  <dig> % for na,  <dig> % for cms-c and  <dig> % for zea mays ssp. parviglumis, and more generally were the main cause of size differences among maize mitogenomes  <cit> . six duplicated fragments were shared between maize  <cit>  and zea mays ssp. parviglumis mitogenomes : {na, nb, cms-c, cms-s and zea mays ssp. parviglumis} shared two duplications , {na, nb, cms-s and zea mays ssp. parviglumis} a  <dig>  kbp duplication, {na, cms-s, cms-t and zea mays ssp. parviglumis} a  <dig>  kbp duplication, {na, nb and zea mays ssp. parviglumis} another  <dig>  kbp duplication and {na and zea mays ssp. parviglumis} a  <dig>  kbp duplication.

na seemed to have a fragment duplicated in tandem, the two copies of its  <dig> kbp fragment were separated by only  <dig>  kbp.

backbone and genome structures
backbone dna sequences
total backbone dna sequence  represented a concatenation of all common fragments between all mitogenomes when considering only one copy of each duplicated sequence. overall, in maize, zea mays ssp. parviglumis, zea perennis and zea luxurians mitogenomes, coding genes  represented  <dig>  to  <dig> %  of the total genome length whereas backbone dna sequences represented  <dig>  to  <dig> %  of the total genome length .

*including duplicates

in all, there were  <dig> orthologous fragments over all mitogenomes . the smallest common fragment size was  <dig> bp and the largest was around  <dig>  bp . differences in size between orthologous fragments were due to indels . for each mitogenome, backbone sequence size was around  <dig> kbp, except for zea luxurians with a size of  <dig> kbp. the multiple alignment length of the eight mitogenome backbones was  <dig>  bp . backbone repartition over zea mitogenomes is given in figure  <dig>  we computed the gap sizes in the mitogenome sequences from the multiple alignment. most of the gaps were  <dig> bp long as previously described by allen and colleagues  <cit>  and the insertions were small repetitions . compared to the other mitogenomes, zea luxurians had more gaps longer than  <dig> bp. this mainly explains the backbone length difference between zea luxurians and the other mitogenomes.

genome structure sequence
the genome structure sequence  is a block sequence characteristic of each mitogenome. it is built with block markers- which we hereafter call synteny anchors- that are common to all eight mitogenomes. synteny anchors are composed of protein coding genes, trnas, rrnas, orfs, pseudogenes and non-coding sequences from the backbone dna sequences . before paralog identification and synteny anchor collapsing , gsss contained  <dig> synteny anchors. they represented  <dig>  to  <dig> % of mitogenome lengths  . figure  <dig> provides a schematic view of gss bpisac repartition over mitogenomes and shows that gss bpisac uniformly covers all mitogenomes. it must be noted that in gss, the numbers of synteny anchors correspond to one or more mitogenome markers: when they were systematically located together and in the same order in all eight mitogenomes, they were grouped into a single synteny anchor . consequently there were  <dig> synteny anchors corresponding to  <dig> markers common to all mitogenomes. synteny anchors contained from  <dig>  to  <dig> markers . as is generally the case in mitochondrial genomes, markers that were systematically grouped in our  <dig> mitogenomes were not composed of genes involved in the same metabolic pathway. duplicated synteny anchors represented a large part of mitogenomes, particularly in na, cms-c and zea mays ssp. parviglumis:  <dig> % of the synteny anchors were duplicated in na,  <dig> % in nb,  <dig> % in cms-c,  <dig> % in cms-s,  <dig> % in cms-t,  <dig> % in zea mays ssp. parviglumis, and  <dig> % in zea luxurians and  <dig> % in zea perennis.

using gsss bpisac and assuming that tandem duplication was the underlying mechanism, we observed that most of the duplicated synteny anchors were indeed located in regions that could result from tandem duplication events. the fact that two regions did not share exactly the same synteny anchor content suggested deletion events of some duplicates after duplication. we called this mechanism tandem duplication with partial loss . a hypothesis of tdpl in zea mays ssp. parviglumis is shown in figure  <dig> 

following the method described in figure  <dig> and methods , gss was obtained for each mitogenome, where duplicates were distinguished and/or collapsed. we identified  <dig> tdpls specific to a mitogenome  where the two duplicates were still side by side,  <dig> tdpls shared by some mitogenomes  where the two duplicates were physically separated and  <dig> tandem duplications specific to a mitogenome and where the copies were physically separated . for these duplications, we hypothesized that the duplicates  had been separated by rearrangement events after duplication. in the end, gsss contained  <dig> blocks: the  <dig> original synteny anchors, minus  <dig> that were eliminated because orthologs and paralogs could not be distinguished, plus  <dig> additional blocks after paralog/ortholog identification. transformation from gss bpisac to gss for cms-c and zea perennis is shown in figure  <dig> 

sequence phylogeny
bootstrap values  indicated that the topology of the tree was relatively robust  with some uncertainty regarding the separation between cms-c and the remaining three zea mays mitogenomes . the maximum likelihood  phylogenetic tree had the same topology as the nj phylogenetic tree and bootstrap values  were higher for all nodes. molecular clock with ml was rejected .

we also constructed a phylogenetic tree with concatenated protein coding gene sequences which exhibited the same topology as the one from the backbone sequence but with shorter branch lengths .

rearrangement phylogeny
phylogenetic analysis was based on rearrangement using gsss. the phylogenetic tree was congruent with the one from backbone dna sequence. jackknife values were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, 100% and 100% for the five most terminal nodes . tests were performed with different percentages of synteny anchors kept in the jackknife computation . when  <dig> to 90% of the synteny anchors were kept, the main tree was congruent with the sequence tree.

we built a phylogenetic tree with a data set excluding blocks containing duplicated synteny anchors. it is noteworthy that the resulting tree was not congruent with the sequence tree. this highlights the importance of taking into account duplication events in the analysis. moreover, when we deleted all copies of each duplicated synteny anchors, the data set went down from  <dig> to  <dig> synteny anchors.

mitogenome rearrangement evolution
a parsimonious tree was constructed using mgr  with gsss. this method has the advantage of providing a potential ancestral sequence at each node  .

it was possible to reintroduce duplication events in the mgr tree. indeed, duplication of synteny anchors { <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> 18} can be put on the na branch, duplication of synteny anchors { <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> - <dig> - <dig> - <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> 18}and { <dig>  <dig> - <dig>  <dig> 4} on the cms-c branch and duplication of synteny anchors {- <dig> - <dig> - <dig> - <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> - <dig> - <dig> - <dig> - <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> 18} on the zea mays ssp. parviglumis branch. these duplication events were followed by synteny anchor loss and inversions . it was then possible to obtain a parsimonious evolutionary history of all eight mitogenomes. likely events were positioned on each branch of the tree where  denotes an inversion,  a tandem duplication,  a tandem duplication with partial loss and  a loss. in figure  <dig>  an example of an evolutionary scenario is given from a <dig> to zea mays ssp. parviglumis and na.

it must be noted that some rearrangement events need not occur in an absolute order except for overlapping inversions, tdpls and the last inversion in cms-c and zea mays ssp. parviglumis. it appears that overlapping inversions must be chronologically oriented in the evolution history: for example, from a <dig> to zea mays ssp. parviglumis, inversion i{-31:-59} has to occur before inversion i{47:-3}. however, non-overlapping inversions can be permuted: for example, i{-20b:-20a} can occur either before or after i{-31:-59}. two duplications have an ancestral position: td{20:22} is ancestral to maize and teosinte mitogenomes and td{27} is specific to maize mitogenomes . over time, the duplicates were separated.

it is important to note that scenarios for all mitogenomes, computed by mgr, were consistent with rearrangement sites  observed at the sequence level by allen and colleagues  <cit> . indeed, many rearrangements predicted by mgr occurred between the second copies of synteny anchors  <dig> and  <dig> ; we also found rearrangement points near synteny anchors  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  whereas we did not find any rearrangements between synteny anchors  <dig>  and  <dig>  .

discussion
we analyzed the evolution of mitochondrial genome structure within a plant species by concomitantly building a phylogenetic tree based on sequence polymorphism and a phylogenetic tree based on structural rearrangements among genomes. both trees were congruent, suggesting that both sources of polymorphism are correlated, i.e. the more divergent a genome is, the more rearranged it is. therefore it was possible to reconstruct an evolutionary scenario, suggest ancestral genome structures along the different nodes of the tree, and pinpoint tandem duplication as a possible mechanism in the important gene shuffling of plant mitochondrial genomes.

methodology to deal with duplicates
from a methodological point of view, dealing with duplicates together with rearrangement events is a challenge. if one was able to distinguish between paralogous and orthologous synteny anchors, the problem would be reduced to the study of rearrangements with exactly one copy of each synteny anchor in each genome. unfortunately, finding paralogous synteny anchors is usually a very difficult task . even if one was able to distinguish them, it remains that some duplicates are specific to a given genome or to a subset of genomes. different methods have been proposed to deal with such datasets. in the exemplar model  <cit> , only one copy of each duplicate is kept. in the maximum matching model  <cit> , one keeps as many copies as the minimum number of copies of one duplicate found in a genome. the choice of which copy to keep is made according to an optimization function. for genome rearrangement purposes, this function consists in choosing the copies that minimize the evolutionary distance between two genomes. but such methods can be applied only if the number of duplicates remains small, otherwise the number of reduced genomes is too large. this is the case with our data. the exemplar genome approach would have led us to explore more than  <dig> million datasets from our eight mitogenomes. in the special case of tandem duplications, a method was previously described with random loss   <cit> . unfortunately, in that model exactly one of each duplicate is immediately lost just after the duplication event, and the method proposed cannot be adapted because the underlying algorithms require that each marker synteny anchor be present only once in each genome.

therefore we proposed a framework to analyze the rearrangement history of a set of genomes containing duplicates. in this framework we assumed that most of the duplicates came from tandem duplication events and that rearrangements occurring within a duplicated segment were independent from the other rearrangement events. although this is not necessarily true in the general case, we found evidence of tandem duplication in parts of the genome. these hypotheses provided a means to deal with duplications and to allow us to propose both a scenario of rearrangements and a history of duplication events. we thus elaborated a four step method to account for duplicates. in short, we concealed duplicates to compute rearrangement scenarios and then we reintroduced them. the method was the following : i) identify tdpls and collapse them in order to keep one copy of each synteny anchor, ii) distinguish between paralogs and orthologs for remaining duplicated synteny anchors, iii) apply the usual rearrangement algorithms , iv) expand the previously collapsed tdpls in step i) to recreate the tdpl event. the main difficulty of the first step is to correctly determine the boundary of the duplicated segment. we saw that using the information of the synteny anchor neighborhood shared by the genomes could help determine these boundaries . the second step proved to be more difficult since we had to deal with the problem of ortholog versus paralog identification. we supposed that the number of duplicated blocks involved in a tdpl but far apart from each other was rather limited and that the methods described above could thus be used. in this last case, though, the neighborhood could help distinguish between both duplicates . when the duplicates were not in tandem, we added the duplicated block in tandem with its counterpart in genomes in which it was missing because the block content had to be the same for the third step of the method. this did not change the distances among genomes nor did it modify scenarios. indeed, adding the duplicated block next to its counterpart created an adjacency that was implicitly conserved when computing parsimonious scenarios. the last step consisted of replacing the collapsed tdpls by their original block sequences. the duplication events were placed on the tree depending on whether tdpl was shared by several genomes or not. if the tdpl was specific to one genome, the duplication event necessarily occurred after the last speciation event. if a tdpl was shared by two or more genomes, the most parsimonious hypothesis was that the duplication event occurred just before the speciation event.

phylogenetic relationships among zea mitochondrial genomes
the phylogenetic relationships among maize mitogenomes concord with a former study by allen and colleagues  <cit>  where na and nb were described as being the most-closely related mitogenomes, followed by cms-c, cms-s and cms-t. on the basis of their nucleotide divergence, cms-s and cms-t were suggested to be the oldest cytoplasms. the introduction of two additional mitogenomes from the outgroup species of teosintes zea luxurians and zea perennis also suggested the ancestral position of cms-s and t. former studies on mitochondrial and chloroplastic diversity in zea pointed out the fact that cms-s was an old cytoplasm and most likely the result of introgression from teosinte zea mays ssp. mexicana. but the phylogenetic location of cms-t, due to a strong nucleotide divergence and a concomitant rearranged genome, is puzzling since cms-t shares the same co-inherited chloroplastic genome with cms-c and nb  <cit> . consequently, the high divergence of cms-t might not have occurred in a molecular clock tempo . chloroplastic sequence data could shed light on the relative ages of the cytoplasms studied. it is interesting to note that the same phenomenon was observed when considering the chloroplastic nucleotide diversity among several cytoplasms of wild beet: cytoplasm nv and cms owen are closely related when considering chloroplastic nucleotide divergence  <cit>  while mitochondrial genomes are highly rearranged and exhibit about 8% of specific sequences  <cit> .

the phylogenetic location of zea mays ssp. parviglumis included in the zea mays clade concords with the scenario of a recent maize domestication from this teosinte subspecies  <cit> . moreover, it highly suggests that the cytoplasms we studied differentiated before domestication.

tandem duplication with partial loss as a plausible mechanism
tandem duplication is a mechanism that has been demonstrated or at least suggested in mitochondrial genomes of several animal species, even though the underlying molecular mechanism is not always understood  <cit> . tandem duplications have been mainly observed in chordata, particularly in vertebrates such as lizards  <cit> , salamanders  <cit> , amphibians  <cit>  or gulper eels  <cit> . cases of tandem duplication are not restricted to chordata, they have also been reported in echinodermata  <cit> , insecta  <cit>  and lophotrochozoa   <cit> . it must be noted that different types of tandem duplication have been observed in all these species: duplications of the whole genome, tandem duplications of genome parts, tandem duplications of non-coding regions or tandem duplications of one gene. in most cases, only one functional copy of the duplicates remains after duplication.

mitochondrial genomes of maize and teosintes  could undergo the same mechanism of tandem duplication with loss as animal mitochondrial genomes. a possible mechanism could rely on the integration in the master chromosome of minicircles generated by homologous recombination between direct repeats from the original master circle, resulting in a duplication event  <cit> . but this would imply a preferential adjacent integration . the low substitution rate in the maize mitogenome may explain why, in maize mitogenomes, one or more copies of duplicated synteny anchors remain, as opposed to animal mitogenomes where all gene copies but one are lost. more generally, a causal link has been suggested between mutation rate and genome compactness that could explain the large size and gene duplicate occurrence of plant mitochondrial genomes when compared with their animal counterparts  <cit> . the fact that the same mechanism could be involved in mitochondrial genomes of plants and animals falls in line with the monophyletic origin of animal and plant mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . for example, red algae  <cit> , that form an independent lineage that radiated contemporarily with the other evolved eukaryotic lineages, demonstrates characteristics of both plant  and animal mitochondria . similar observations have been made for acanthamoeba castellanii  <cit>  or trichoplax adhaerens  <cit> .

looking at the literature from the past decades, emphasis has been put on differences between animal and plant mitogenomes in their evolutionary dynamics and at the structure level  <cit> . while a compact circular genome is found in the majority of animal lineages, the plant mitogenome was described as a dynamic equilibrium of isoforms of a master circular chromosome and sub-molecules due to the occurrence of repeated sequences favoring intragenomic recombination. in this context, it is particularly interesting to notice that the evolutionary scenario based on rearrangement among master circles is congruent with the analysis based on sequence divergence among them. therefore, it appears that master circles might reflect more than a virtual synthetic representation.

CONCLUSIONS
despite important structural shuffling among genomes, even at the species level, we were able to build a phylogenetic tree using rearrangement events between plant mitochondrial genomes that was congruent with a sequence-based tree. to our knowledge this is the first evolutionary scenario of a plant mitogenome proposed solely on the basis of rearrangement events in complete dna sequences. we showed that, under the hypothesis of structure evolution through inversions and tandem duplications with loss, an evolutionary path could be drawn for each genome. while such evolutionary events have been identified in animal mitogenomes, the hypothesis of a similar mechanism has never been discussed for plant mitogenomes. further work will consist of developing new tools in order to automatically look for signatures of tandem duplication events in other plant mitogenomes and evaluate the occurrence of this process on a larger scale.
