BACKGROUND
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  are a group of persistent organic contaminants  that are ubiquitous in the environment  <cit> . their toxicity  and potential of accumulation in biota have led to concern about their fate and transport in the environment  <cit> . the major sources of pahs in the environment include incomplete combustion of organic residues , petroleum production, volcanic eruptions, and enzymatic polymerization of the benzene ring from plant exudates to the soil  <cit> . although these contaminants are mainly metabolized and decomposed via environmental biotic and abiotic processes  <cit> , pahs in the environment have gradually increased over the past several decades. for example, in daya bay, south china, before  <dig>  the temporal distribution of pah concentrations in sediments was below  <dig> μg·kg- <dig> , but by  <dig>  concentrations had risen to  <dig> μg·kg- <dig>  <cit> . this increased pah accumulation in the environment is because the rate of pah release from anthropogenic activities is greater than the rate of natural attenuation.

several remediation technologies and protocols have been developed to restore pah-contaminated sites  <cit> . phytoremediation is a potent and efficient approach that removes pahs from contaminated sites into plants and decomposes them to less hazardous or non-hazardous forms with minimum input of chemicals and energy  <cit> . previous studies have shown the efficacy of plant uptake and metabolism of pahs in removing pahs from the environment  <cit> . in general, two primary processes are responsible for pah transfer and distribution in plant tissues:  transfer between plant tissues and cells driven by transpiration and the pah concentration gradient across plant-cell components and  accumulation of pahs in plant tissues, with the extent related to plant lipid contents  <cit> . however, the factors that influence pah transfer and distribution in plants as well as their metabolism in cells are not clear. plant uptake of pahs from contaminated media is primarily through the roots and secondarily through leaves  <cit> . pahs and their degradation products have frequently been detected within plant tissues  <cit> . a recent study has shown that in zea mays phenanthrene can be metabolized into more polar products  <cit> . in another study, anthracene and formed metabolites were bound to several cell-wall components, such as pectin, lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose  <cit> . similarly, wild et al.  investigated the distributions of anthracene and its metabolites in zea mays and suggested that the metabolism of anthracene occurs predominantly in the cell wall  <cit> .

uptake from water and soil via plant roots is a major pathway of pah entry into plants. wild et al.  reported that pahs first adsorbed to root surfaces and then passed through the membranes of adjoining cells before accumulating in cell walls and vacuoles  <cit> . the amount of uptake depended primarily on the lipid content of plant roots, in which protein, fats, nucleic acids, cellulose tissues, and other components all contain lipophilic components, which appear to be the primary domains where pahs accumulate once they penetrate plant root cells  <cit> . unfortunately, despite extensive studies on the transport of organic contaminants  in plants, information about pah distributions in intracellular tissues of plant roots, stalks, and leaves is lacking. this limits the development of mechanism-based phytoremediation strategies to better improve treatment efficiency.

in this study, we investigated the uptake and subcellular distributions of pahs in root cells of ryegrass , which is widely used in the phytoremediation of pah-contaminated sites owing to its fibrous root system and large specific root surface area. our results will enhance the understanding of pah transfer mechanisms in plants and their effects on the distribution of pahs in plants.

RESULTS
uptake of phenanthrene and pyrene by roots
in figure  <dig>  the uptake of phenanthrene and pyrene from hoagland medium by ryegrass roots is shown as a function of exposure time. the uptake rate and magnitude of uptake of phenanthrene and pyrene by ryegrass roots differed. concentrations of phenanthrene and pyrene in roots increased with exposure time, reaching a maximum at ~ <dig> h. although phenanthrene concentrations in roots were higher within this timeframe, they were less than two times the concentration of pyrene, most likely because of a higher initial concentration in the medium of phenanthrene  than of pyrene . from  <dig> to  <dig> h, the phenanthrene concentration in roots decreased sharply from  <dig> to  <dig> mg·kg- <dig>  whereas that of pyrene declined gradually from  <dig> to  <dig> mg·kg- <dig>  these differing uptake patterns could result from a difference in the migration of phenanthrene and pyrene to ryegrass shoots, their degradation in roots, or both. the slower rate of pyrene reduction after  <dig> h indicates that pyrene is recalcitrant to metabolism in roots and that, as the more lipophilic compound, it exhibits a strong affinity for plant tissues, slowing its transport from roots to shoots.

although spontaneous volatilization could be a cause of pah dissipation from water, it is thought to be primarily related to plant accumulation and metabolism  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the dissipation efficiency of pahs from hoagland solution by ryegrass, which we defined as the ratio of pah removal to the initial concentration of pah in aqueous solution. dissipation efficiency increased gradually with exposure time, reaching 92% for phenanthrene and 62% for pyrene at  <dig> hours. this result is consistent with the relatively rapid reduction of phenanthrene in ryegrass roots, which could be due to its high metabolism rate in ryegrass, relatively quick migration from roots to shoots, or both.

the root concentration factor  describes the capability of roots to accumulate contaminants from direct contact with an aqueous environment, which is here defined as the ratio of pah concentration in roots  to that in the culture medium : rcf = croot/csolution  <cit> . rcf values increased with increasing root/solution contact time before approaching a nearly constant value after  <dig> h . the rcf values of pyrene were about two times greater than those of phenanthrene. our previous study indicated that the lipophilicity  of a compound is a determinant of the magnitude of plant uptake  <cit> . the higher pyrene rcf is due to its greater lipophilicity  compared with that of phenanthrene . gao et al.  reported that pyrene uptake by plants from soil was 4- <dig> times greater than uptake of phenanthrene  <cit> . together, these results suggest that more lipophilic organic contaminants have a higher propensity for uptake in plants via roots.

subcellular movement and distribution of phenanthrene and pyrene in root cells
pahs in roots were distributed into three subcellular fractions: water-soluble, cell wall, and organelle. the proportions of phenanthrene and pyrene in the water-soluble, wall, and organelle fractions are plotted against exposure time in figure  <dig>  from  <dig> h to  <dig> h of exposure, the percentage of phenanthrene in cell walls notably descended from 84% to 42% and pyrene decreased from 60% to 41%. within the same period, phenanthrene and pyrene distributions in organelles increased from  <dig> % to 41% and from 21% to 33%, respectively. both pahs showed a relatively small variation in the proportion in the aqueous soluble fraction, ~10-15% for phenanthrene and ~10-20% for pyrene. thus, at the beginning of uptake , the decrease of pah in cell walls largely corresponded to the increase in cell organelles, suggesting that pahs first accumulated in cell walls via direct contact with hoagland solution and then gradually transferred to fractions inside cells, such as organelles. after  <dig> h of exposure, the distributions of both pahs in cell components approached a relatively stable state in cell walls and organelles . in ryegrass root cells, content in cell walls was  <dig> %, and that in organelles was  <dig> %. the relatively smaller organelle fraction accumulated a similar amount of each pah compared with that in cell walls, likely owing to the higher lipid content of organelles. generally, the uptake capability of root tissues for organic lipophilic compounds increases with kow value , with more lipophilic compounds showing a higher accumulation in plants, particularly in plant tissues containing a high lipid content  <cit> . lipids in plant cell walls are composed mostly of polysaccharides , with a few structural proteins, lignin, lectin, and mineral elements as well as a very small lipid component. in contrast, the lipid content of plant organelles is 15-30%  <cit> , enabling them to draw pahs from the cell wall. thus, the relatively higher lipid content of the organelle fraction is believed to be responsible for the greater accumulation of pahs, and the corresponding concentration gradient established between organelles and cell walls in the beginning stage of uptake  is the driving force for the diffusion of pahs to interior cell components.

as shown in figure  <dig>  pah concentrations in soluble components stayed nearly constant. the separated soluble cellular components, mainly consisting of cell solution and largely concentrated in the cell matrix between cells or organelles, can be regarded as an intracellular buffering distribution phase. due to the hydrophobicity of pahs, these aqueous substances were not easily enriched. thus, the non-affinity between pahs and soluble cellular components may result in distributive constant and low partitioning proportions.

subcellular fraction-concentration factor  values, defined as the ratio of pah concentration in subcellular fractions to that in water-soluble cellular components, are shown in figure  <dig>  the sfcf of phenanthrene in cell walls decreased from  <dig> to  <dig> l·kg- <dig> over  <dig> h of exposure. for pyrene, the sfcf in cell walls first increased from  <dig> to  <dig> l·kg- <dig> and then decreased rapidly to <  <dig> l·kg- <dig>  the difference in cell-wall sfcfs of phenanthrene and pyrene likely resulted from the different properties of the two pahs, as in the beginning stage, pyrene tended to accumulate more in cell walls than in water-soluble components owing to its higher logkow.

in the initial  <dig> h, the sfcfs of the two pahs were greater in cell walls than in cell organelles. after that period, organelle fraction sfcfs slightly exceeded those of cell walls. these results suggest that within the first  <dig> h of exposure, subcellular transport of pahs occurred from cell walls to intracellular organelles as a result of the concentration gradient.

CONCLUSIONS
transpiration is generally considered to be the main transfer mechanism of pahs in plants, such as from roots to stalks and leaves  <cit> . pahs initially adsorb to plant cell walls and then gradually diffuse into subcellular tissues. the lipid contents of intracellular components determine the extent of lipophilic compound accumulation, and the diffusion rate is related to the concentration gradient established between cell walls and organelles inside cells. in addition, although both phenanthrene and pyrene are grouped among organic compounds that share similar properties, pyrene displays greater accumulation factors in subcellular walls and organelle fractions due to a higher logkow. our results will be useful in evaluating human exposure risks of pah-contaminated crops and in developing appropriate strategies for the phytoremediation of pah-contaminated sites.

remaining question
to our best knowledge, this is the first paper reporting the distribution of persistent organic pollutants , with pahs as representatives, in plant subcellular tissues. it is noteworthy that in this study, although the negligible amounts of pure cell membrane could not be separated from other cell fractions by the centrifugal method and it was merged into the soluble components in the investigation, results of this work open new insights into pop subcellular transport and distribution in plants.
