BACKGROUND
protein farnesylation is the process by which proteins bearing a carboxyl terminal caax motif  are post-translationally modified by the covalent attachment of a fifteen-carbon farnesyl group  <cit> . this modification results in the formation of a stable thioether bond between the cysteine of the caax motif and the farnesyl moiety, with farnesyl diphosphate serving as the farnesyl donor . this lipidation reaction is catalyzed by protein farnesyltransferase , which is a cytosolic enzyme consisting of α- and β-subunits  <cit> . in a similar process, proteins bearing a carboxyl terminal caax motif with leu, ile, met, or phe in the terminal position are modified by the covalent attachment of a twenty-carbon geranylgeranyl group to the cysteine of the caax motif. this modification is catalyzed by protein geranylgeranyltransferase type i , which is a cytosolic enzyme consisting of an α-subunit identical to that of pft and a distinct β-subunit  <cit> . a third enzyme, protein geranylgeranyltransferase type ii , also called rab geranylgeranyltransferase , catalyzes the geranylgeranylation of rab proteins bound to the rab escort protein . all three enzymes have been found in protozoans, metazoans, fungi, and plants, including peas  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , and arabidopsis  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, a single gene encodes the common α-subunit of pft and pggt <dig>   <cit> , a second gene encodes the β-subunit of pft   <cit> , and a third gene encodes the β-subunit of pggt <dig>   <cit> . the era <dig> gene was so named because knockout mutations in this gene cause an enhanced response to abscisic acid  in both seed germination and stomatal closure assays. consequently, era <dig> mutants exhibit increased seed dormancy and stomatal closure in response to aba, and are drought tolerant  <cit> . these observations suggest that at least one farnesylated protein functions as a negative regulator of aba signaling. however, to date, a farnesylated negative regulator of aba signaling has not been definitively identified. era <dig> plants also exhibit enlarged meristems and supernumerary floral organs, especially petals, and this phenotype is greatly exaggerated in plp mutants lacking the common α-subunit of pft and pggt <dig>  <cit> . the more severe developmental phenotype of plp mutants compared to era <dig> mutants suggests that pggt <dig> partially compensates for loss of pft in era <dig> mutants  <cit> . plants with defects in the ggb gene exhibit increased aba-induced stomatal closure and auxin-induced lateral root formation  <cit> , but without significant developmental phenotypes. these observations suggest that at least one geranylgeranylated protein functions as a negative regulator of aba signaling and at least one functions as a negative regulator of auxin signaling. indeed, rop <dig> and rop <dig>  which are geranylgeranylated small gtpases  <cit> , have been shown to function as negative regulators of aba signaling, and rop <dig> and aux 2- <dig>  have been shown to function as negative regulators of auxin signaling  <cit> . moreover, arabidopsis plants possess two genes encoding g protein γ-subunits, both of which are geranylgeranylated, and mutants lacking either of these genes exhibit an enhanced response to auxin-induced lateral root formation  <cit> . prenylated proteins have also been implicated in a plethora of other processes, including calcium signal transduction  <cit> , response to heat and heavy metal stress  <cit> , cytokinin biosynthesis  <cit> , and regulation of the cell division cycle  <cit> . given these multiple roles, it is surprising that, unlike other organisms, arabidopsis plants survive without the shared α-subunit of pft and pggt <dig>  <cit> .

proteins that are prenylated by either pft or pggt <dig> are further modified. first, the aax portion of the caax motif is proteolytically removed by specific caax proteases   <cit>  and, second, the isoprenylcysteine at the newly formed carboxyl terminus is methylated   <cit> . two distinct isoprenylcysteine methyltransferase  enzymes, encoded by the atste14a  and atste14b  genes, catalyze the methylation of carboxyl terminal isoprenylcysteines in arabidopsis  <cit> . demethylation of isoprenylcysteine methyl esters is catalyzed by isoprenylcysteine methylesterase , which is encoded by the icme gene   <cit> .

as described above, two geranylgeranylated proteins  and at least one farnesylated protein negatively regulate aba signaling in arabidopsis. however, it is not clear at the present time how these proteins function in aba signaling. the stomata of ggb plants were found to exhibit an enhanced response to aba, consistent with the known role of rop <dig> in negative regulation of aba-induced stomatal closure  <cit> , but the response of ggb seeds to aba was normal, despite a report that rop <dig> is involved in negative regulation of aba signaling in seeds  <cit> . while this may seem like a contradiction, it is possible that pft activity in ggb plants is sufficient for the prenylation and function of certain prenylated proteins, such as rop <dig> . indeed, numerous reports exist of prenylated proteins that are substrates of both pft and pggt <dig> and others that are substrates of either pft or pggt <dig>  <cit> . given this heterogeneity in the specificity of pft and pggt <dig> for certain caax proteins, deconvoluting the complex roles of protein prenylation in negative regulation of aba signaling, meristem development, and other fundamental processes poses a significant challenge. nevertheless, to address this problem, we characterized arabidopsis pft and pggt <dig> with respect to substrate specificity and catalysis. these studies were aimed at answering the following questions: 1) what distinguishes plant caax prenyltransferases from animal and fungal prenyltransferases and what gives them their unique substrate specificities? 2) do the substrate specificities of arabidopsis pft and pggt <dig> potentially explain the phenotypes of era <dig> and ggb mutants? the results reported here indicate that arabidopsis pft exhibits less specificity for the terminal position of the caax motif than pft enzymes from metazoans and yeast and arabidopsis pggt <dig> exhibits greater specificity for caax motifs with leucine in the terminal position than pggt <dig> enzymes from metazoans and yeast. these results potentially explain the phenotypes of era <dig> and ggb mutants. moreover, we show that different caax substrates exhibit differences in reactivity rather than differences in affinity in the presence of arabidopsis pft and pggt <dig> 

RESULTS
recombinant arabidopsis pft is more specific for isoprenoid substrates than pggt <dig>  whereas pggt <dig> is more specific for caax substrates
to functionally characterize arabidopsis pft and pggt <dig>  we co-expressed the plp and era <dig> coding sequences in e. coli using the petduet- <dig> vector . we also co-expressed the plp and ggb coding sequences in e. coli . iptg-inducible pft and pggt <dig> activities were detected in e. coli extracts and analyzed for substrate specificity using fpp, ggpp, and  <dig> distinct gfp-bd-caax protein substrates, which were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the gfp-bd-caax constructs recently reported by gerber et al.   <cit> . as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  recombinant arabidopsis pft exhibited modest selectively for the terminal amino acid of the ca1a2x motif. gfp-bd-caax substrates with glutamine, methionine, serine, cysteine, alanine, isoleucine, and even leucine  were appreciably farnesylated by arabidopsis pft. as previously reported, pft exhibited low selectivity for the a <dig> position of the ca1a2x motif, consistent with the observation that the a <dig> position is solvent exposed and not constrained by active site amino acids  <cit> . in contrast, pft exhibited high selectivity for the a <dig> position, with charged amino acids  strongly excluded. gfp-bd-caax substrates that were efficiently farnesylated were also weakly geranylgeranylated by arabidopsis pft, but gfp-bd-caax farnesylation was 50-fold greater than geranylgeranylation .

as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  recombinant arabidopsis pggt <dig> exhibited high selectivity for the terminal amino acid of the ca1a2x motif. only gfp-bd-caax substrates ending in leucine were significantly prenylated by this enzyme . as with pft, pggt <dig> exhibited low selectivity for the a <dig> position of the ca1a2x motif, consistent with the observation that the a <dig> position is solvent exposed and not constrained by active site amino acids. on the other hand, pggt <dig> exhibited extremely high selectivity for the a <dig> position, and only gfp-bd-caax substrates with a hydrophobic amino acid at the a <dig> position  were prenylated. gfp-bd-caax substrates that were efficiently geranylgeranylated were also farnesylated by pggt <dig>  indeed, gfp-bd-caax geranylgeranylation was only 4-fold greater than farnesylation in the presence of recombinant arabidopsis pggt <dig> 

purified recombinant pft is more active than purified recombinant pggt1
the next step in the characterization of arabidopsis pft and pggt <dig> was to examine the activity and substrate specificity of purified recombinant enzymes. the enzymes described above were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography  using talon®; co2+-based resin. as shown in figure  <dig>  imac-purified enzymes  were assayed and found to exhibit the same substrate specificities as described above . comparing purified recombinant pft and pggt <dig> allowed us to make the following conclusion: purified recombinant pft is 30- to 100-fold more active than purified recombinant pggt <dig>  this is not due to errors in the expressed sequences, nor is it likely to be due to differential effects of the flag tag on the alpha subunit or the  <dig> × his-tags on the two β-subunits because the amino termini of prenyltransferase α- and β-subunits are solvent exposed and not involved in the formation or stabilization of active heterodimers  <cit> . moreover, plant extracts  consistently exhibit 30- <dig> fold higher pft activity compared with pggt <dig> activity  <cit> .

kinetic analysis of recombinant arabidopsis pft and pggt1
purified recombinant arabidopsis pft and pggt <dig> were subjected to kinetic analyses under michaelis-menten conditions . the results of these experiments were interpreted by lineweaver-burk analysis and are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the catalytic constants  shown in table  <dig> for arabidopsis pft confirm the results shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  both data sets demonstrate the following substrate preferences for arabidopsis pft : gfp-bd-cviq , gfp-bd-cvim , gfp-bd-cvii  and gfp-bd-cvil . moreover, the results in table  <dig> show that, while different caax substrates  have similar km values, they have markedly different kcat values in the presence of arabidopsis pft. thus, pft substrate specificities reflect differences in catalytic turnover rate rather than differences in binding affinity. the catalytic constants  for arabidopsis pggt <dig>  which are shown in table  <dig>  confirm the results shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  both data sets demonstrate the following substrate preferences for arabidopsis pggt <dig> : gfp-bd-cvil , gfp-bd-cvii , gfp-bd-cvim  and gfp-bd-cviq . moreover, while different caax substrates have slightly different km values, they have dramatically different kcat values. indeed, the significantly higher kcat value for gfp-bd-cvil is the primary determinant of substrate specificity for arabidopsis pggt <dig>  while these kcat values can be compared, they are nevertheless low, suggesting that only a fraction of the purified pggt <dig> protein was catalytically active.

discussion
in this report, it is shown that recombinant arabidopsis pft exhibits broad specificity for caax substrates with gln, met, ser, cys, ala, ile, or leu in the terminal 'x' position, whereas pggt <dig> exhibits strict specificity for caax substrates ending in leu. both pft and pggt <dig> exhibit little or no specificity for the a <dig> position of the ca1a2x motif, which is consistent with previous observations using mammalian prenyltransferases that the a <dig> position is solvent exposed and not constrained by active site amino acids  <cit> . in contrast, both prenyltransferases exhibit specificity for the a <dig> position of the ca1a2x motif. while the mechanism for caax specificity remains unknown for arabidopsis pft and pggt <dig>  it is clear that the substrate specificities of both prenyltransferases reflect differences in catalytic turnover rates rather than differences in km values . this finding suggests that, while binding affinities of gfp-bd-cviq, gfp-bd-cvim, gfp-bd-cvii, and gfp-bd-cvil to the active sites of pft and pggt <dig> are similar, the terminal amino acid of the caax motif dramatically affects catalysis. moreover, the data described above provide an explanation for era <dig> and ggb phenotypes. pft prenylates a wide range of caax substrates and compensates almost fully for loss of pggt <dig> in ggb plants. however, pggt <dig> specifically prenylates caal substrates and only partially compensates for loss of pft in era <dig> plants. these biochemical differences potentially account for the mild phenotype of ggb mutants and the dramatic phenotype of era <dig> mutants.

the different isoprenoid specificities of arabidopsis pft and pggt <dig> cannot be explained by differences in km. indeed, the km for fpp was only slightly lower than that for ggpp in the presence of recombinant arabidopsis pft, despite the fact that caax farnesylation was 50-fold greater than geranylgeranylation in the presence of this enzyme . moreover, the km values for fpp and ggpp were almost identical in the presence of recombinant arabidopsis pggt <dig>  despite the fact that pggt <dig> catalyzed caax geranylgeranylation 4-fold more efficiently than farnesylation. thus, the primary determinant of isoprenoid substrate specificity is reactivity rather than binding affinity.

the results in figure  <dig> raise an interesting question. given the higher specific activity and lower caax substrate specificity of pft, why are caax substrates with leucine in the terminal position predominantly geranylgeranylated rather than farnesylated in planta  <cit> ? the results in figure  <dig> suggest that a cail  protein should be predominantly farnesylated in planta because farnesylation of cail  by arabidopsis pft is approximately 20% as efficient as farnesylation of caim , which greatly exceeds the efficiency of cail  geranylgeranylation by pggt <dig>  we propose that pft is regulated in planta, perhaps by post-translational modifications or protein-protein interactions, to reduce recognition and farnesylation of caax substrates with leucine in the terminal position. nevertheless, it is likely that caax substrates with leucine in the terminal position are, to some extent, farnesylated by pft and that these aberrantly farnesylated proteins retain full or partial function. this explains why ggb mutants, which were expected to exhibit severe meristem and tip-growth defects due to loss of rop function, do not exhibit these phenotypes  <cit> .

we propose that pggt <dig> activity is higher in planta than the purified recombinant, e. coli-expressed pggt <dig> activity we have characterized. the activity observed with purified recombinant pggt <dig> was low, suggesting that only a portion of the purified pggt <dig> enzyme was active. despite this, the relative kcat/km values obtained for different caax substrates in the presence of pggt <dig> were consistent with the results shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, recombinant arabidopsis pft is shown to prenylate caax substrates with little specificity for the terminal amino acid. in contrast, recombinant arabidopsis pggt <dig> is shown to exclusively prenylate caax substrates with leucine in the terminal position. these different substrate specificities provide a straightforward explanation for the phenotypes of era <dig> and ggb mutant plants. in addition, substrate specificities for pft and pggt <dig> are shown to reflect differences in catalytic turnover rates rather than differences in substrate binding.
