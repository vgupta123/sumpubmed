BACKGROUND
a majority of escherichia coli strains are benign residents of the intestinal tract of mammals, however a minority of e. coli isolates are pathogenic and cause a variety of diseases ranging from diarrhea to urinary tract infections and to meningitis. genes encoding virulence factors such as adhesins, invasins, and toxins that allow pathogenic e. coli to colonize, invade, and damage host cells, are often coordinately regulated and tend to be clustered in the genome.

the ability to lyse erythrocytes  by expression of hemolysins is a common feature among e. coli strains causing extraintestinal infections. one of the most characterized hemolysins is hlya or α-hemolysin which is produced by uropathogenic e. coli , although several other types of hemolysins have been described for e. coli from different patho-groups  <cit> . the clya gene, located at  <dig>  min on the e. coli chromosome, encodes a 34-kda protein, clya  which causes lysis of mammalian cells by pore formation in a calcium-independent fashion. clya is the only cytolytic factor found in non-pathogenic strains of e. coli including the k- <dig> strains commonly used in laboratory studies  <cit> . the clya+ transcription is known to be subjected to transcriptional silencing by the h-ns nucleoid protein in e. coli k- <dig>  <cit>  and it can be activated by the transcriptional regulator slya  <cit> . considering the strict regulation of clya in non-pathogenic e. coli laboratory strains it is of interest to understand how this gene locus functions in other e. coli isolates. sequences homologous to the clya gene have been identified in a number of pathogenic isolates of e. coli  <cit> . in addition, upon screening of several different salmonella enterica serovars, functional homologues to the clya gene were identified in the typhoid salmonella serovars typhi and paratyphi a  <cit> . the presence of the clya gene in wild-type isolates of salmonella suggests a conserved function of the gene product although its role in pathogenesis is unclear. nevertheless, clya appears to be associated with virulence in s. enterica. the role of clya in salmonella virulence was analyzed using the s. enterica serovars brandenburg, indiana, panama, and schwarzengrund;  <dig> different serotypes of the strains were examined and the presence of clya was suggested to be associated with virulence in these s. enterica serovars  <cit> .

in bacteria, the process of adapting to a host may involve not only acquisition of virulence determinants but also loss of gene functions. pathogenicity-adaptive, or patho-adaptive, mutations may represent a genetic means for enhancing bacterial virulence without horizontal transfer of specific virulence factors, i. e. genes that are detrimental to a pathogenic lifestyle are deleted  <cit> . such patho-adaptive mutations, which occur following the acquisition of new genes, may represent fine-tuning of the genome repertoire of a newly created pathogen to adapt to its new pathogenic lifestyle  <cit> . earlier studies have provided genetic and/or phenotypic evidence for naturally occurring mutations that are either required for, or dramatically increase the ability of bacteria to enter, spread within, or sustain themselves in a virulence niche  <cit> . for instance the spontaneous deletion of cada, encoding lysine decarboxylase, substantially increases the virulence of entero-invasive e. coli  and shigella spp.  <cit> .

e. coli is considered to be clonal, and phylogenetic analyses of this species have shown that the strains fall into four main groups: a, b <dig>  b <dig> and d  <cit> . recent attempts to establish a link between phylogeny and virulence suggest that the a and b <dig> phylogenetic groups should be considered to represent the normal flora of different vertebrates, and most human commensal strains originate from these groups  <cit> . the standard escherichia coli collection of reference strains , a set of e. coli strains isolated from diverse hosts and geographic locations, was designed to represent genotypic variation in e. coli  <cit> . the collection contains  <dig> wild-type e. coli isolates from human and  <dig> other mammalian species, obtained from a larger collection of approximately  <dig> isolates  <cit> . our previous results clearly showed that the clya locus was truncated due to deletion mutations in several of the e. coli isolates  <cit> . one or more deletions in the clya locus were found in  <dig> of  <dig> tested ecor b <dig> strains  <cit> . furthermore, deletion mutations in the clya locus were identified in two of the  <dig>  ecor a strains, one of the  <dig>  ecor d strains and one of the four  ecor e strains. in contrast, an intact clya locus was found in 100% of the  <dig> ecor b <dig> isolates examined. the b <dig> phylogenetic group represents e. coli strains involved in extra-intestinal infections  <cit> . the uropathogenic e. coli isolates  <dig>  j <dig>  and five additional  previously described extra-intestinal pathogenic ) carried a truncated clya gene. at least four different variants of Δclya exist among such strains suggesting that the deletions in clya arose on more than one occasion  <cit> . similar findings have been reported from additional surveys of e. coli isolates from different sources  <cit> . furthermore, the recent study by murase and co-workers showed that gene inactivation at the clya locus also has occurred in strains of the ecor b <dig> phylogroup  <cit> .table  <dig>

in this report we present findings with derivatives of e. coli k- <dig> and the upec isolate e. coli  <dig> in which we constructed a restored clya+ locus as well as a clya-lux chimeric operon to quantitatively measure expression at the transcriptional level under different growth conditions.

RESULTS
deletion mutations at the clya locus of escherichia coli
analysis of the dna sequences revealed four different variants  of the Δclya alleles and differences in their distribution in the e. coli isolates  <cit> . the strains used in this study are summarized in table  <dig> and sequence details are shown in figure  <dig>  deletion variant i include two deletions: one major 493-bp deletion spanning from 164 bp upstream to 329 bp downstream of the clya translational start codon, and one minor 204-bp deletion spanning from  <dig> to 585 bp downstream of the clya translational start codon. variant i was found in  <dig> of the  <dig> ecor b <dig> strains, in ecor <dig> and ecor <dig> of group a, and in the upec/nbm isolates ad <dig>  ds <dig>  ia <dig>  ih <dig>  ihe <dig> and j <dig>  deletion variant ii is similar to variant i, but with an intact 1327-bp is- <dig> element positioned adjacent to the upstream 493-bp deletion in the opposite orientation of the clya coding sequence. variant ii was found in ecor <dig> and ecor <dig> of group b <dig>  deletion variant iii is similar to variant i with a deletion in the promoter region but in addition had a deletion in the clya coding region. variant iii was identified in the uti isolate  <dig>  deletion variant iv is a 12-bp-long in-frame deletion from  <dig> to 558 bp downstream of the clya translational start. variant iv was found in the ecor <dig> and ecor <dig> group e and d, respectively.table  <dig>

the presence of a nearly perfect 10-bp repeat  immediately upstream of the major 493-bp deletion, and overlapping with the 3′ end of the deleted segment  , suggested that the variant i deletion was the result of a recombination event. we found no such dna repeats that would explain the internal 204-bp or 217-bp deletions in the clya coding sequence . as shown in the case of variant iv  a short 5-bp repeat  was identified at the junctions of the 12-bp internal deletion observed in ecor <dig> and ecor <dig>  indicating that this deletion is likely to be the result of a recombination event. the site of insertion of the is <dig> element and the generated 5-bp direct repeats  in ecor <dig> and ecor <dig> suggested that the is <dig> element was inserted after the deletion was generated .figure  <dig>

construction of a restored clya+ locus in the upec strain e. coli 536
to study whether or not the absence of the clya gene in extra-intestinal e. coli isolates reflects that this gene may be disadvantageous for the bacterial cells, clya+ derivatives of the upec strains  <dig> and j <dig> were constructed. we used a suicide plasmid derivative  and allelic exchange to introduce the clya wild type allele, together with a kanamycin resistance cassette as a selectable marker at 350 bp downstream of the clya stop codon, resulting in the strains jon <dig>  and jon <dig> , respectively. a schematic illustration of the construct jon <dig> with restored clya+ locus is shown in figure 2a. the strains harboring the clya+ allele at the correct position on the chromosome was confirmed by pcr analysis and dna sequencing . the restored clya wild type allele in the upec strains was constructed with dna sequences from e. coli k- <dig> and it was evident that these sequences were highly conserved among different e. coli. we performed a multiple sequence alignment of the clya promoter region and coding sequences using a large set of publicly available e. coli genome sequences . it included sequences from different e. coli pathotypes and from commensally occurring isolates . inspection of the upstream region revealed that sequences corresponding to the transcriptional and translational start sequences with the regulatory sequence elements  and binding sites for regulatory proteins , as defined from studies of e. coli k- <dig> derivatives, are conserved among the many different expec and non-expec e. coli isolates with intact clya loci.

to assess the level of expression and activity of clya in jon <dig> and jon <dig>  the hemolytic activity of the strains was scored on the blood agar plates. we observed a calcium-dependent hemolytic phenotype in strains jon <dig> and jon <dig> when they were grown on blood agar plates. when the ca2+ chelator na-oxalate was added , all strains showed a non-hemolytic phenotype . in our earlier experiments, we showed that lysis of the host bacterial strains promote the release of clya using lytic bacteriophages or mitomycin c  <cit> . to deliberately provoke lysis of the bacterial cells, we placed 2 μl of mitomycin c  onto horizontally streaked rows of the strains  <dig> and j <dig>  and the clya+ derivatives jon <dig> and jon <dig> on the blood agar plates . zones of hemolysis appeared for both jon <dig>  and jon <dig> , but not for the parental strains  <dig> and j <dig> . the results clearly indicated that the restored clya locus in these derivatives  of strains  <dig> and j <dig> was expressed and our further tests verified that they could produce the clya protein at a detectable level . the presence of clya protein in the clya+ derivatives was confirmed by western immunoblotting analysis using polyclonal anti-clya antiserum . subcellular localization experiments showed that clya protein was present in the periplasmic fraction of upec derivatives to the same extent as has been found in the case of e. coli k- <dig> .

we showed in earlier studies that in clya+e. coli k- <dig> derivatives, a small subpopulation of bacterial cells  apparently expressed a high enough level of surface-exposed clya to be visible by immunofluorescence microscopy  <cit> . in order to compare the surface expression and export of clya protein in individual bacterial cells of the clya+ upec derivative jon <dig> with the standard e. coli k- <dig> strain mg <dig>  we performed immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-clya antibodies and with the upec strain  <dig> used as negative control. as shown in figure  <dig>  clya was detected on the surface of several jon <dig> cells whereas there was very little immunofluorescence detected in case of the e. coli k- <dig> strain mg <dig>  taken together, the studies of clya expression indicated that protein might be present at a somewhat higher level and/or exposed more abundantly on the surface of the jon <dig> bacterial cells in comparison with that of the e coli k- <dig> cells.figure  <dig>

growth phase dependent expression of clya in jon53
in order to quantitatively monitor the transcriptional expression level of clya, a clya::luxab operon construct was integrated in tandem to the clya+ locus in the chromosome of jon <dig> as described in the methods and schematically depicted in figure 2a. the resulting strain was designated coe <dig> . in our earlier studies, we observed the growth phase dependent expression of the clya gene in the e. coli k- <dig> derivative carrying the clya::luxab construct   <cit> . the transcription level of the clya::luxab operon in strain coe <dig> was therefore compared to the level in strain jon <dig> throughout the growth cycle. as shown in figure 4a, the luciferase activity of the upec derivative coe <dig> increased continuously during the exponential growth phase and peaked at the late logarithmic phase of growth where it showed a more than five-fold increase compared to the e. coli k- <dig> clya::luxab operon derivative jon <dig> figure  <dig>

transcription of clya can be activated by the sfax/papx transcriptional regulatory protein family encoded by fimbrial gene clusters in upec strains
in e. coli k- <dig> the transcriptional regulator slya is known to activate clya+ transcription by counteracting the silencing the h-ns nucleoid protein is causing  <cit> . however, the slya gene seems to be present in most, if not all, e. coli and the same is true for the hns gene, suggesting that their role in clya transcriptional regulation  would be conserved among different non-pathogenic and pathogenic e. coli. nevertheless, we performed a multiple sequence alignment of the slya promoter region and coding sequences using a large set of publicly available e. coli genome sequences  to see if there would be any differences hinting to altered regulation of slya expression among different e. coli. it included sequences from different e. coli pathotypes  and from commensally occurring isolates. inspection of the upstream region revealed that sequences corresponding to the transcriptional and translational start sequences with the regulatory sequence elements , as defined from studies of e. coli k- <dig> derivatives, are completely conserved among the many different e. coli isolates indicating that there would be no obvious difference in slya expression and regulation .

recent studies have shown that there are regulatory proteins  that show resemblance to the slya protein and are encoded by genes in fimbrial gene clusters typically occurring in upec isolates but which are absent in e. coli k- <dig>  <cit> . we therefore decided to investigate if the slya-like regulator sfax might influence the expression of the clya locus. in upec strain  <dig> there are two fimbrial gene clusters, sfa and prs that include genes for such regulatory proteins, sfax and prsx, respectively. in order to specifically test if the sfax protein can influence expression of clya we performed tests with the sfax+ wildtype and a mutant derivative of the expec strain ihe <dig> which is known to have only one copy of the sfax gene family  <cit> . a plasmid construct with the clya+ gene under control of its natural promoter region was introduced into strain ihe <dig> and the sfax::kan derivative aes <dig>  a mutant derivative  defective in the sfay gene located immediately upstream of sfax in the same operon was also included. the sfay protein is predicted to function as a c-di-gmp phosphodiesterase and thereby indirectly involved also in the activity of the transcriptional regulator sfax  <cit> . it is also postulated that the sfay mutation is causing a polar effect that may reduce sfax expression. the phenotypic test of clya-mediated hemolytic activity showed that colonies of the wildtype strain ihe <dig> caused stronger hemolysis than the mutant derivatives indicating that its expression and/or release of clya was higher than that of aes <dig> and aes <dig> . western immunoblot analysis of clya protein levels, using the plasmid encoded enzyme β-lactamase as reference, indicated that the sfax+sfay+ wild type bacteria produced a somewhat higher level of clya than the mutant derivatives .table  <dig>

as a more direct assessment of the potential influence of the sfax/papx regulatory gene products on clya gene transcription in a upec strain we tested what effect overproduction of sfax protein might have. a plasmid with the cloned sfax+ gene was introduced into the upec derivative coe <dig> carrying the clya::luxab operons construct in the chromosome. for comparison we included a test with another regulator, the papi protein known to be part of a regulatory protein complex at the major promoter region of the pap and sfa fimbrial gene clusters in upec isolates  <cit> . the strain carrying the plasmid with the sfax+ gene  was named coe <dig>  a vector plasmid control strain was named coe <dig>  and the strain carrying the plasmid with the papi+ gene  was named coe <dig>  samples for luciferase activity measurements were taken during the growth of these strains in lb medium . the results demonstrated that the upec strain carrying the sfax+ plasmid  had a greatly enhanced level of clya transcription. no such effect was seen with the papi+ clone . these results strongly support the suggestion that the presence of sfax protein in upec isolates can cause up-regulation of clya gene expression and that the effect could be stronger with higher levels of sfax/papx proteins in such e. coli strains.figure  <dig>

the clya+ derivative of upec strain e. coli  <dig> has increased susceptibility to the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin b
considering the relatively high expression levels of the pore-forming protein in the upec derivatives, we decided to test the possibility that restoration of the clya locus in strain  <dig> might influence its cell wall or membrane properties and perhaps change its susceptibility to antimicrobial compounds directed towards membranes. the strain jon <dig> was therefore cultured in medium supplemented with serially diluted concentrations of different antimicrobial peptides , and with different concentrations of urea or creatinine. we compared the mic values for each antimicrobial compound with the parental strain  <dig> and the clya+ derivative jon <dig>  our preliminary studies indicated that there was no difference in mic values between the two strains for either of the tested compounds . likewise, there were no differences detected when different concentrations of creatinine in the medium were tested. however, when a sub-inhibitory concentration  was present in the medium the clya+ derivative jon <dig> displayed a somewhat slower growth in presence of polymyxin b, manifested as a more prolonged lag, than the parental upec strain  <dig> . the normal aum medium contained 170 mm urea. at a two-fold higher concentration  of urea also the parental upec strain  <dig> seemed more susceptible to the effect of the sub-inhibitory concentration of polymyxin b . at even higher concentrations of urea  the presence of polymyxin b per se did not seem to alter the growth much but both strains showed reduced growth. notably, it was evident that the higher concentrations of urea affected growth of the clya+ derivative jon <dig> more than that of the parental Δclya upec isolate .figure  <dig>

the effect of polymyxin b on growth was also monitored with the e. coli k- <dig> strains mc <dig> and mwk <dig>  the latter being a derivative of mc <dig> with a constitutive expression of clya protein due to an improved binding site near the promoter for the camp-crp activating complex  <cit> . these strains showed a similar mic value  for polymyxin b as the upec strains. in the growth test with polymyxin b at half the mic value  the higher clya expression did not cause any apparent disadvantage but when polymyxin b was added at a somewhat higher concentration  the clya+ phenotype was correlated to reduced growth also in the case of the e. coli k- <dig> derivatives .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in escherichia coli several different pore-forming cytolysins have been identified. the one most extensively studied is α-hemolysin , which is produced by many uropathogenic e. coli  strains and contributes to virulence as shown in several animal models  <cit> . the biological role of the clya protein, representing a novel family of non-rtx toxins in enterobacteriaceae, remains to be discovered, although the distribution of the clya locus in a wide array of isolates would indicate that it has an evolutionarily conserved function. the clya gene is clearly conserved in enterobacteria, i. e., in many e. coli isolates and in typhoid serovars of salmonella enterica  <cit> .

a functional clya gene was evidently lost through deletion in several e. coli strains, e. g., in  <dig> of the  <dig> ecor strains, and the Δclya alleles were present in a number of different variants. some strains carried various deletions in the clya coding sequence and in the upstream region, resulting in truncated clya loci. in the majority of cases , the function of the clya locus may be effectively abolished by two deletions, removing the promoter region and portions of the n-terminal and central regions of the coding sequence. in ecor <dig> and ecor <dig>  a 12-bp in-frame deletion  results in the expression, at a level similar to that of the clya+ derivative jon <dig>  of a clya polypeptide that was found to have no or very low hemolytic activity . the presence of short repetitive dna sequences at the junctions of the major 493-bp deletion in Δclya variants i-iii  and the 12-bp deletion of Δclya variant iv  suggests that these deletions may have been formed as a result of slippage mispairing. the role of direct repeats in deletion formation has been demonstrated by sequence analysis of several deletion mutants in e. coli  <cit> . since no such repeats were identified at the junctions of the other deletions, i. e. the 203- or 217-bp deletions in Δclya variants i-iii , these deletions appear to have arisen by some other mechanism. they could be the result of subunit exchange between dna gyrase molecules, since this model has been suggested for deletions terminating in sequences that are neither directly nor inversely repeated  <cit> . it also appears that after the functionality of a clya locus was lost, further alterations occurred, e.g., insertion of an is- <dig> element , and non-conservative point mutations in the clya coding sequence.

considering the possibility that there might be some patho-adaptive selection for mutations in clya of some e. coli we restored, and studied the expression of, a functional gene locus in the chromosome of the upec isolate  <dig> 

in order to determine if regulatory genes of fimbrial gene clusters typically present in the chromosome of upec can upregulate the expression of clya, a plasmid carrying the sfax gene was introduced into the restored upec derivative and we observed that the level of clya was upregulated at the early stationary phase of growth. therefore, the sfax gene does upregulate clya expression.

although the prevalence of e. coli strains with an intact clya gene in the ecor a and b <dig> groups would support the argument that clya has no direct role in virulence, it cannot be ruled out that pathogenic rather than non-pathogenic isolates under certain conditions may express higher levels of clya and/or more efficiently translocate the protein. in contrast to the commensal strains, extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli are mostly derived from group b <dig> and, to a lesser extent, from group d  <cit> . there is a phylogenetically clustered distribution of the virulence-associated determinants alpha-hemolysin , type-ii capsule , and p  and s  fimbriae in the e. coli b <dig> and d groups  <cit> , and it has been suggested that the b <dig> strains should be considered highly virulent as evidenced by a mouse model of extra-intestinal virulence  <cit> . hence, the fact that every one of the  <dig> strains in the b <dig> group of the ecor collection contained a Δclya allele  <cit>  strongly suggests that e. coli strains adapted for an extraintestinal lifestyle have the clya gene deleted. on the other hand, it does not necessarily imply that some selective condition or mechanism must be found in the extraintestinal locations where e. coli may reside.

in a study using multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and sequencing of the mdh housekeeping gene, it was concluded that pathogenic strains of e. coli do not have a single evolutionary origin but have arisen on several occasions  <cit> . similarly, it appears unlikely that there is a common ancestor for all Δclya strains, e. g. two ecor strains in the a group and one in the e group were Δclya. the presence of different variants of the truncated clya locus suggests that clya is a preferred target for deletion mutations, and that such deletions have arisen on several independent occasions. the adaptation to a particular host may involve loss of virulence traits that are important for infection of a wider spectrum of animals  <cit> . similarly, it is possible that the clya locus could be inactivated in the process of acquisition of new genes  that would promote transition to an extra-intestinal lifestyle. one hypothesis consistent with our present findings would be that the strict regulation of clya could be lost during this transition. in e. coli k- <dig> the clya locus is strictly regulated and its expression is silenced by the h-ns protein  <cit> . one plausible explanation for the strict regulation in case of such genes appearing as cryptic/silenced would be that less strictly controlled alleles of such genes are disadvantageous to the bacteria under certain environmental conditions  <cit> . in this context it may be interesting to carry out further studies with strains from ecor group d that seem to have an intact clya+ locus whereas it remains to be established if they produce clya protein and how expression is controlled.

in previous studies, it was demonstrated that epithelial cells of the urinary tract in humans and mice secrete an antimicrobial peptide, cathelicidin, upon contact with upec and that the severity of the bacterial invasion is linked to bacterial resistance to cathelicidin  <cit> . while we did not detect any effect of the tested cathelicidin  on the growth of the bacteria, it remains to be determined if the clya+ upec derivative is more susceptible to such peptides under in vivo conditions. we may hypothesize that the mutations in the clya gene were selected for either under growth-limiting antimicrobial peptide stress conditions in the urinary tract to which bacterial cells are maladapted or under some other condition of stress for example in the intestine where likewise the combination of a clya+ allele and some other trait might be unfavourable. the mutations in the clya gene may adapt the bacteria to this stress condition and thereby contribute to the bacterial survival as pathoadaptive events. the constructs described in this work should allow us to test such hypotheses in suitable model infection systems.

in order to test the potential impairment of membrane integrity in the restored strain, the jon <dig> strain was cultured in presence of the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin b which can disrupt the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane by interacting with its phospholipids. the mic value for polymyxin b of jon <dig> was not altered in comparison with the wild type upec strain  <dig> although there was a clearly detectable negative effect on the growth of the clya+ derivative jon <dig> when polymyxin b was added at a sub-inhibitory concentration. also higher concentrations of urea in the medium caused this differential effect on the growth of the two strains.

although a rather preliminary finding that will need to be studied further, the observed higher susceptibility to the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin b that was seen in the case of the upec with a restored clya+ locus would suggest that such a phenotype is more of a disadvantage in the intestinal locations where other bacteria, e.g. bacillus, are producing antimicrobial peptides.
