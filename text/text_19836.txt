BACKGROUND
dna vaccination has gained a lot of attention since its ability to induce long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses against an encoded antigen was discovered  <cit> . in addition, dna vaccination poses no danger of integration into host cellular dna thereby raising its safety profile  <cit> . dna vaccines can be easily isolated to high purity, encode multiple antigens, and possess inherent adjuvant activity due to the presence of unmethylated cpg motifs that are recognized in mammals by tlr <dig>  <cit> . so called purified “naked” dna vaccination was shown to be highly efficient in rodents and mice, but not in larger animals and humans  <cit> . consequently, it is very important to optimize dna vaccine vectors and develop a delivery system to facilitate cellular uptake and enhance gene transfer efficiency and expression in situ <cit> .

several strategies have been explored to protect plasmids from degradation, facilitating dna uptake by phagocytic antigen presenting cells  and thereby enhancing their immunological properties. this includes delivery technologies based on encapsulation into synthetic particles  or the use of viral vectors  <cit> . despite their potential, some limitations and safety issues still remain which can restrict the application of gene therapy - e.g. the complexity of producing liposomes and their limited packaging capacity  <cit> . additionally, it was shown that some viral vectors have the capacity to randomly integrate their genetic material into the host genome causing insertional mutagenesis of a cellular oncogene, leading to tumour formation  <cit> .

the use of bacteria as delivery vehicles for dna vaccination has emerged as an interesting alternative to overcome many of the problems associated with viral or liposomal delivery  <cit> . w. schaffner was the first to observe genetic material transfer from bacteria to mammalian cells  <cit> . since then, bacteria have been extensively exploited as vaccine delivery vehicles for vaccination against bacterial and viral pathogens as well as cancer immunotherapy  <cit> . the use of bacteria for mucosal delivery of dna vaccines may be advantageous due to their potential to elicit secretory iga responses as well as systemic immunity, when compared to conventional parenteral immunization  <cit> . furthermore, bacterial carriers can increase and expand the magnitude of immune responses against the vector-encoded antigen due to the natural presence of pathogen-associated molecular patterns  that bind to toll-like receptors  and activate immune cells  <cit> .

presently, attenuated pathogens such as salmonella, shigella, listeria, yersinia, as well as, non-pathogenic escherichia coli have been used as experimental live delivery systems  <cit> . an advantage of using attenuated pathogens as dna vaccine vehicles is that they possess mechanisms to adhere or invade host cells with a negligible risk of reversion to a virulent strain via gene transfer or mutation. however, a potential concern is the risk of increased virulence in young or immunocompromised individuals.

the use of food-grade lactic acid bacteria  as dna delivery vehicle represents an alternative and attractive strategy to deliver dna vaccines at the mucosal surfaces . the dietary group of lab, including lactococcus lactis and many species of lactobacillus, is generally regarded as safe  organisms of which some are intestinal commensals of humans. indeed, it has been extensively demonstrated that these bacteria are able to deliver a range of vaccine and therapeutic molecules for applications in allergic, infectious or gastrointestinal diseases  <cit> . a relatively new development, however, is their use as a vehicle for genetic immunization  <cit> . previous experiments performed by our group showed that either native l. lactis  or recombinant invasive ll expressing fibronectin binding protein a  of staphylococcus aureus or internalin a  of listeria monocytogenes   <cit> , were able to deliver dna in epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating potential as gene transfer vehicles  <cit> . however inla does not bind to its murine receptor, e-cadherin, thus limiting the use of ll-inla+ in in vivo murine model. on the other hand, fnbpa requires an adequate local concentration of fibronectin to bind to its receptors, integrins  <cit> .

in order to avoid the limitations of inla and fnbpa and improve our knowledge on the key steps by which the dna is transferred to mammalian cells using l. lactis, ll was engineered to express a mutated form of internalin a  that increased binding affinity to murine and human e-cadherin  <cit>  thus allowing for in vivo experiments in conventional mice. herein, we describe the construction and characterization of this novel l. lactis strain as a dna delivery vector, using cow’s milk β-lactoglobulin  allergen, to measure dna transfer to intestinal epithelial cells  in vitro and in vivo.

overall, the production of minla+at the surface of lactococcus lactis increased the invasisity of bacterium and amount of plasmid transfer by  <dig> and  <dig> fold, respectively. in vivo, blg production was detected in isolated enterocytes after oral administration of ll-minla+blg and was slightly higher than oral administration of ll-blg.

RESULTS
mutated internalin a is produced on the surface of recombinant l. lactis strain
to investigate surface expression and production of minla, l. lactis nz <dig> and ll-minla+ strains were incubated with specific anti-minla monoclonal antibody and then with fitc-conjugated anti-mouse igg. stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. as shown in figure  <dig>  ll-minla+ strain  showed a significant shift in the fluorescence intensity comparing to the nz <dig> strain . no shift was observed when strains were incubated with fitc-labeled anti-mouse igg alone . this experiment confirmed expression of minla on the surface of l. lactis.


l. lactis producing minla is efficiently internalized by caco- <dig> cells
non-confluent caco- <dig> cells were incubated for  <dig> h with either nz <dig> or with ll-minla+. non internalized bacteria were killed by gentamicin and intracellular bacteria enumerated after lysis of the eukaryotic cells. the ll-minla+ strain exhibited 1000-fold greater invasion rate than nz <dig> strain .


ll-minla+ internalization analyzed by confocal microscopy
ll-minla+ and nz <dig> strains were labeled with cfse dye and then incubated with caco- <dig> cells for  <dig> h. cells were fixed and confocal images were obtained. very few cell-associated bacteria could be detected after co-incubation with nz <dig> . in contrast, the ll-minla+ strain strongly bound to the membrane of cell clusters which is compatible with the known binding of inla to e-cadherin, a cell-cell adhesion molecule. in addition, ll-minla+ was located intracellularly in some cells .


ll-minla+ can efficiently deliver in vitro a dna vaccine containing β-lactoglobulin cdna
to test the ability of ll-minla+ to deliver a dna vaccine plasmid in vitro to iecs, we transformed ll-minla+ strain with pvalac:blg  <cit> , a plasmid derived from pvalac  <cit>  containing the cdna for blg, under the control of an eukaryotic promoter to generate strain ll-minla+blg .

in order to monitor plasmid transfer and production of blg in caco- <dig> cells extracts, non-confluent caco- <dig> cells were incubated with noninvasive l. lactis strains, ll and ll-blg , or with ll-minla+blg for three hours. after incubation with these bacteria, cell supernatant and proteins extracts from caco- <dig> cells were tested for blg expression using an eia. blg production was measured in caco- <dig> cells protein extracts incubated with either ll-blg or ll-minla+blg. however, incubation with the ll-minla+blg strain resulted in  <dig> fold higher levels of blg compared to ll-blg strain demonstrating that surface expression of minla enhanced intracellular delivery of the dna vaccine dna .


secreted levels of blg were increased  <dig> fold after co-incubation with ll-minla+blg compared to ll-blg . these data shows that ll and ll-minla+, can mediate gene transfer of a dna vaccine to caco- <dig> cells in vitro and that invasiveness significantly increases the efficiency of dna delivery.

dna delivery efficiency in vivo is slightly improved by the production of minla
mice were intragastrically administrated with ll, ll-blg or ll-minla+blg for three consecutive days, and the small intestine removed for isolation of iecs. blg production was detected in protein extracts from iecs of mice administered with ll-blg and ll-minla+blg but not with control mice . in both of the ll-blg and ll-minla+blg treated groups, some mice did not show production of blg suggesting that dna delivery may be a stochastic event depending on environmental factors. even if this trend was not statistically significant, the number of mice producing blg  was systematically higher  in the group administered with invasive bacteria than with noninvasive bacteria  suggesting that the ll-minla+strain is a slightly better dna delivery vehicle than non-invasive strain.


discussion
there is a large body of research demonstrating that the use of l. lactis is able to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses to an antigen produced in rodents .

recently, we showed the ability of either native or recombinant invasive l. lactis as both in vitro and in vivo dna delivery vehicle  <cit> . recombinant invasive l. lactis strains were obtained by producing heterologous invasins which are proteins expressed at the surface of pathogens responsible for their invasivity. we first built lactococci expressing internalin a  from listeria monocytogenes  and showed that ll-inla+ were able to 1) deliver a plasmid in vitro and 2) be invasive in vitro and in vivo in guinea pigs  <cit> . nevertheless, the use of ll-inla+ is restricted because inla does not bind efficiently to its murine receptor, the e-cadherin  <cit> . subsequently, we produced another invasin, the fibronectin binding protein a  from staphylococcus aureus and demonstrated that ll-fnbpa+ were invasive and able to transfer a plasmid in vitro more efficiently than non-invasive l. lactis <cit> . however, fnbpa requires an adequate local concentration of fibronectin in order to bind to its receptors, integrins  <cit> , and this limitation could be a problem in vivo. so, in this study we produced a mutated internalin a  at the surface of l. lactis. the two mutations introduced were demonstrated to allow the binding of minla to murine e-cadherin thus permitting in vivo experiments with conventional mice  <cit> .

we first checked that minla was expressed and properly directed to the surface of l. lactis. the shift of fluorescence peak obtained for ll-minla+ in facs analysis was significantly higher as compared to nz <dig> strain thus confirming successful surface expression of minla on l. lactis. other invasins, from gram-positive bacteria, such as inla or fnbpa, have already been successfully expressed in l. lactis confirming that the signal peptide for secretion and the anchoring signal are well recognized by the l. lactis machinery. production of invasins from gram-negative bacteria, such as yersinia pseudotuberculosis invasin at the surface of l. lactis has never been successful .

the invasivity was assessed by gentamicin assay in non-differentiated e-cadherin expressing human epithelial cell line caco- <dig> cells. this experiment showed that ll-minla+strain is 1000-fold more invasive than nz <dig> strain. wollert and collaborators  observed a 2-foldincrease in the adhesion and invasion efficiency of l. monocytogenes strain producing minla compared to wild-type listeria expressing native inla by using gentamicin-protection-invasion assays in caco- <dig> cells  <cit> . a confocal image taken after gentamicin assay showed clearly that ll-minla+ is capable of adhering to and entering in non-differentiated caco- <dig> cells. the preferential distribution of recombinant bacteria at the periphery of the caco- <dig> cell islets can be explained by the fact that e-cadherin is accessible only at the periphery. a similar type of bacterial distribution, around the caco- <dig> cell islets, was previously observed when caco- <dig> cells were co-incubated with ll-fnbpa+ <cit> .

ll-minla+ and ll strains were then transformed with pvalac: blg plasmid, co-incubated with caco- <dig> cells and blg expression was followed  <dig> h later by elisa. blg was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction of caco- <dig> cells which were co-incubated with noninvasive and invasive strains carrying pvalac: blg. this data confirms prior observations that even noninvasive l. lactis can transfer functional plasmids to caco- <dig> cells  <cit> . cells were also capable of secreting the allergen, which is an interesting characteristic facilitating antigen uptake and presentation by professional apcs through cross-priming pathways  <cit> . the use of ll-minla+ improved blg expression around ten times compared to noninvasive strain. our hypothesis is that invasive lactococci can enter in higher numbers inside epithelial cells and thus deliver more plasmids.

noninvasive and invasive l. lactis, carrying pvalac: blg or not, were orally administered for  <dig> consecutive days in balb/c mice. on the fourth day, enterocytes from the small intestine were isolated and blg production was measured by enzyme immunoassay . isolated enterocytes from mice administered with invasive ll-minla+blg produced the same amount of blg as compared to mice immunized with noninvasive ll-blg. thus, we confirmed that noninvasive lactococci are able to transfer a functional plasmid in vivo in mice  <cit> . the use of ll-minla+blg enhanced slightly the number of mice positive for plasmid transfer. surprisingly, blg production was not increased.

these results partly confirmed what we published recently with ll-fnbpa+blg in vitro and in vivo <cit> . oral administration in mice of ll-fnbpa+blg or ll-fnbpa+gfp elicited a gfp or blg production in enterocytes. as with ll-minla+ the blg production was not increased with ll-fnbpa+. however the number of mice producing blg was significantly higher after oral administration of ll-fnbpa+blg compared to non invasive ll-blg. considering these results it seems that ll-fnbpa+strain is a better dna delivery vehicle than ll-minla+.

as no significant advantages were observed by using ll-minla+blg compared to ll-blg, we hypothesize that interactions of recombinant minla with their receptors were impeded in mouse intestinal epithelium. this lack of invasion in vivo was also observed by another group working with e. coli strain expressing invasin from yersinia pseudotuberculosis as an oral vaccine for cancer immunotherapy. they showed that invasive e. coli was unable to enter gut epithelial cells due to a basolateral localization of the receptor, b1-integrin  <cit> . they demonstrated that invasive e. coli expressing y. pseudotuberculosis invasin were selectively uptaken from the intestinal lumen into peyer’s patches using an ex vivo model. similarly, e-cadherin, the minla receptor, is also expressed on the basolateral membrane of iecs which are strongly linked to each other in the gut making e-cadherin less available. it has been shown recently that l. monocytogenes could enter the epithelial membrane through extruding epithelial cells at the top of the villi but mainly through goblet cells which are located deeper in the crypt  <cit> . it is thus possible that ll-minla+blg strain is not able to reach its receptor deeply buried in the crypt. the pathway whereby bacteria could penetrate gut epithelial monolayers could be through microfold  cells in peyer’s patches. these cells are able to take up particles/bacteria from the lumen  <cit> . nevertheless, we cannot exclude any possibility that lactococci can also interact with other cells from the epithelial membrane such as dendritic cells. some subset of dendritic cells is now well known to produce dendrites, able to reach the lumen in order to sample its content  <cit> .

the other hypothesis is that the plasmid would be released in the lumen by lysed lactococci and then captured by the enterocytes. it has been shown that lactococci do not persist in the gut and are very sensitive to its physico-chemical condition  <cit> . most likely, plasmid transfer in vivo is a combination of both mechanisms, bacteria and released plasmid captures. considering these data, the use of lactobacilli which persist longer in the gut than lactococci could be a better option for dna delivery.

CONCLUSIONS
mutated internalin a protein was successfully expressed at the surface of l. lactis nz <dig>  as demonstrated by facs analysis. ll-minla+ strain was demonstrated to be  <dig> times more invasive as compared to nz <dig> strain. this invasiveness capacity was confirmed by confocal microscopy experiments wherein ll-minla+ was found to be attached to caco- <dig> cells and intracellularly located. assays of blg detection after blg expression by eukaryotic cells revealed that the invasive status improved plasmid transfer in vitro. in vivo, the number of mice expressing blg was higher  in the group immunized with invasive bacteria than with noninvasive bacteria . even though this difference was not statistically significant, these study suggests that ll-minla+ strain can be used as a dna delivery vehicle for in vitro or in vivo experiments. the use of other lab species which can persist longer in the gastrointestinal tract, such as lactobacilli, to mediate dna transfer is currently being evaluated.
