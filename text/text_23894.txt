BACKGROUND
venomous animals have long been studied as a source for drug discovery  but are increasingly being studied for insight into evolutionary and ecological processes . because of their medically significant bites, some of the best-studied groups of venomous animals are the snakes of the families elapidae  and viperidae . elapids possess short, fixed front fangs and typically have neurotoxic venoms dominated by three-finger toxins   <cit>  and type-ii phospholipase a toxins   <cit> . viperids possess elongate, rotatable front fangs and typically have venoms dominated by enzymatic toxins, such as snake venom metalloproteinases , which cause tissue-damage, bleeding, and necrosis  <cit> . relatively little, however, is known about the venoms of rear-fanged snakes . these venoms are generally less medically relevant because the bites of most rear-fanged species are not lethal to humans, although notable exceptions such as the boomslang  exist  <cit> . in addition, obtaining venom from rear-fanged species in large quantities is generally not possible. the lack of direct human medical consequences and the difficulty in collecting venom from rear-fanged species have left a large gap in our knowledge of snake venoms  <cit> . further insight into rear-fanged snake venom may lead not only to the discovery of pharmacologically important proteins, but will also aid in our understanding of the evolution of this complex trait.

the family colubridae  <cit>  is the largest family of snakes, consisting of seven subfamilies and more than  <dig>  species  <cit> . hypsiglena  is comprised of at least six species of short, stout-bodied, terrestrial, rear-fanged venomous snakes  <cit> . the genus ranges over a variety of habitats throughout much of western north america, from central mexico northward throughout the drier regions of the western united states and extreme south-central british columbia. members of this genus are largely nocturnal and consume prey as diverse as insect, frogs, and snakes, but more than 70% of their diet consists of lizards and squamate eggs  <cit> . in contrast, the genus boiga  consists of  <dig> species of long, slender-bodied, arboreal rear-fanged venomous snakes. this nocturnal genus ranges over a variety of habitats across india, southeastern asia, and northern australia and is typified by the brown treesnake . the ecology of this species is relatively well characterized because of its introduction and consequent deleterious effects on the island of guam  <cit> . despite the striking contrasts in geography and life history, the diets of hypsiglena and b. irregularis overlap significantly. boiga irregularis consumes mammals, birds, and frogs, but more than 60% of its diet consists of lizards and their eggs  <cit> .

previous work studying the venoms of rear-fanged species used low-sensitivity methods  <cit> , often requiring the pooling of samples and therefore loss of individual variation  <cit> . acquiring venom and gland-tissue in sufficient quantities is challenging for rear-fanged species, but pooling venom from many individuals can confound interpretation of expression and composition. high-throughput transcriptomics  <cit>  and modern proteomic techniques  can be used to circumvent these issues to characterize venoms in far greater detail than has previously been possible, particularly when both approaches are combined  <cit> . to better understand the evolution of colubrid snake venoms, we sequenced the venom-gland transcriptomes from b. irregularis and a member of an undescribed species of hypsiglena  from cochise county, arizona. these two specimens represent two subfamilies within colubridae  <cit> . we used these transcriptomes in conjunction with high-definition mass spectrometry to characterize the venoms of these two species. because of the high sensitivity of these techniques, we were able to use venom and venom-gland samples collected from a single individual for each species.

RESULTS
venom-gland transcriptomes
we generated  <dig> , <dig> pairs of 151-nucleotide reads that passed the illumina filter from the venom glands of b. irregularis. of these,  <dig> , <dig> pairs  were merged on the basis of their 3’ overlaps. these merged reads had an average length of  <dig> nucleotides and an average phred quality score of  <dig>  most reads overlapped over their entire lengths, giving us high confidence in their sequences. the unmerged reads had an average phred quality of  <dig>  transcriptome assembly and annotation resulted in  <dig>  unique nontoxin transcripts with full-length coding sequences and  <dig> unique putative toxin transcripts . these  <dig> toxin transcripts were combined into groups with <1% nucleotide divergence in their coding sequences, resulting in  <dig> distinct clusters. such clustering facilitates the estimation of transcript abundances and provides a better estimate of the number of toxin sequences.figure  <dig>

as has been described for both elapids  <cit>  and viperids  <cit> , the venom-gland transcriptomes of our two rear-fanged colubrids were extremely biased towards the production of toxin transcripts . in b. irregularis, approximately  <dig> % of the total transcription is accounted for by the coding sequences of our putative toxin-encoding transcripts , and the  <dig> most abundant transcripts in the transcriptome encoded putative toxins . in hypsiglena sp., approximately  <dig> % of total transcription was accounted for by the coding sequences of putative toxins , and the  <dig> most abundant transcripts in the transcriptome encoded putative toxins . all of our abundances were based on alignments of reads against only the coding sequences of transcripts.

venom proteomes
to verify the transcriptomic results, we conducted proteomic analyses of the venoms of both species using venom from the transcriptome animals. nanospray lc/mse analysis of the whole venom of b. irregularis identified peptide evidence for  <dig> of the  <dig>  putative toxin transcript clusters using a database generated from all of the unique transcripts  identified in the transcriptome. transcripts identified by means of lc/mse represented three toxin classes , including three distinct clustersof svmps ,  <dig> unique clusters of 3ftxs, and two allelic variants of the cysteine-rich secretory protein  cluster. in addition to distinguishing between transcript clusters within toxin families, our approach was sensitive enough to distinguish between alleles within clusters . the svmpiii- <dig> cluster consisted of two sequences which differed at three nucleotide sites and three amino acid positions. the frequencies of the variants at these positions were all between  <dig> – <dig> %, suggesting that these transcripts were two alleles of a single locus. the crisp- <dig> cluster consisted of four sequences, and we were able to distinguish crisp-1a and crisp-1c from crisp-1b and crisp-1d. these two subgroups differed by a single nonsynonymous mutation with the b/d variant at a frequency of  <dig> % in the transcriptome. our whole venom proteomic approach was sensitive enough to detect these minor differences but failed to detect proteins corresponding to the majority of the putative toxin transcripts . most of the undetected transcripts were in the low-abundance tail of expression levels  and may have fallen below a detection threshold. alternatively, the low expression levels may indicate that these putative toxins are in fact not toxins and do not contribute to the venom. two high-abundance putative toxin transcripts for b. irregularis were not detected: a natriuretic peptide  and svmpiii-3a . detection of nps is often complicated because this class of toxin undergoes significant post-translational processing during maturation  <cit> . the failure to detect svmpiii-3a is more difficult to explain because it is expressed at higher levels than two other svmps  that were detected. the sequence has a clear signal peptide but was the most divergent cluster of the four svmp clusters for b. irregularis.table  <dig>

for hypsiglena sp., we identified peptide evidence for  <dig> of the  <dig>  putative toxin transcript clusters. the identified toxins belonged to four classes , including a previously proteomically unverified fused toxin containing waprin and kunitz-type protease inhibitor domains. a similar putative toxin was detected in the venom-gland transcriptome of the viperid sistrurus catenatus edwardsii <cit> . we proteomically verified the secretion of at least two unique alleles of crisp, two clusters of c-type lectins , and  <dig> clusters of svmps . we also found peptide evidence for hemoglobin subunit β <dig>  suggesting that a small amount of blood was mixed with the venom during extraction. the only high-abundance putative toxin transcript for which we failed to detect a corresponding protein in the venom was np- <dig>  probably for the same reasons we failed to detect the orthologous protein in the venom of b. irregularis.table  <dig>

the elapid-like venom of boiga irregularis
combining the transcriptomic and proteomic characterizations of the venom of b. irregularis, we found that this long, slender, largely arboreal colubrid has venom redolent of the venoms of its elapid cousins. the most abundant and diverse toxin class for b. irregularis was the 3ftxs . three-finger toxins possess a conserved structure of three loops, which are stabilized by disulfide bridges, extending from a central core  <cit> . these toxins are often neurotoxic, selectively binding muscarinic  <cit>  and adrenergic  <cit>  receptors. in b. irregularis, 3ftxs have been shown to possess toxicity specific to birds and lizards  <cit> . we identified  <dig> unique 3ftx sequences that grouped into  <dig> clusters. these  <dig> 3ftx clusters accounted for  <dig> % of the toxin-reads and  <dig> % of the total transcription. all ten clusters of 3ftxs were proteomically confirmed and could be divided into three groups on the basis of their lengths and conserved cysteine residues. of these three groups, the smallest contained clusters 3ftx- <dig> and 3ftx- <dig> and was most closely related to 3ftx-tel <dig>  previously isolated from the venom of the colubrid telescopus dhara   <cit> . these two clusters of sequences from b. irregularis differed from 3ftx-tel <dig> by  <dig> % and  <dig> % at the amino-acid level, respectively. this group was characterized by nine conserved cysteine residues and a total length of  <dig> amino-acids after removal of the predicted signal peptides. the two sequences in this group differed by  <dig> % at the amino-acid level. the second largest group consisted of clusters 3ftx- <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  these sequences shared  <dig> conserved cysteine residues and an amino-acid length of  <dig>  the sequences in this group had pairwise amino-acid differences ranging from  <dig> – <dig> %. the largest group was composed of clusters 3ftx- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  these sequences had  <dig> conserved cysteine residues and lengths ranging from 90– <dig> amino-acids after removing predicted signal peptides. interestingly, none of these 3ftx sequences were particularly similar to irditoxin , a 3ftx previously isolated from b. irregularis <cit>  with properties consistent with this group. all our 3ftx sequences showed ≥ <dig> % amino-acid divergence. this lack of a close match to irditoxin may reflect the different geographic origins of our animal compared to that of pawlak et al.  <cit> . the sequences in this group have pairwise amino-acid differences ranging from  <dig> – <dig> %.

three-finger toxins are among the most common and diverse venom components in elapids but are only rarely detected in viperids. for the elapid micrurus fulvius, 3ftxs were the second most diverse and highly expressed class of venom genes in the venom-gland transcriptome  <cit> . similarly, for the elapids ophiophagus hannah  <cit>  and bungarus flaviceps   <cit> , 3ftxs were the most abundant venom transcripts in the venom-gland transcriptomes. in contrast, of the numerous viperid venom-gland transcriptomes that have been characterized  <cit> , few have shown evidence of 3ftxs. the transcriptome of sistrurus catenatus edwardsii showed evidence for 3ftxs, but this evidence consisted of five distinct transcripts at extremely low abundances  <cit> . a 3ftx was also detected at low levels in the transcriptome of protobothrops flavoviridis <cit>  and in the venom proteome of atropoides nummifer <cit> . three-finger toxins have been described for colubrids  <cit> , but our results show that colubrid venoms can be as diverse and specialized for 3ftxs as the venoms of elapids.

the highest-abundance individual transcript was a svmp, and, overall, b. irregularis expressed four clusters of svmp, although only three of these were detected proteomically . the coding sequences from these four clusters accounted for  <dig> % of the toxin-reads and  <dig> % of the total reads. all of these svmps were class p-iii  <cit> , possessing both a disintegrin-like domain and a cysteine-rich domain in addition to the metalloproteinase domain  <cit> . class p-iii snake venom metalloproteinases are capable of rapid hemorrhagic activity by degrading the basement membranes and adhesion proteins and disrupting structural components of the tissues  <cit> . they are generally associated with the hemorrhagic venoms of viperids  <cit> , but they are also well-represented in the venoms of elapids  <cit> . for example, the venom-gland transcriptome of the eastern coral snake  had moderate levels of svmp expression  <cit> .

the only other putative toxin detected proteomically for b. irregularis was a single cluster of crisp, a toxin class identified in the venom of b. irregularis in a previous study  <cit> . cysteine-rich secretory protein transcripts accounted for  <dig> % of the toxin transcription and  <dig> % of the total transcription . these toxins have diverse functions. in snake venoms, they have been shown to block cyclic nucleotide-gated and voltage-gated ion channels and inhibition of smooth muscle contraction, potentially disrupting homeostasis  <cit> . their full role in envenomation, however, is still unclear  <cit> . cysteine-rich secretory proteins are widespread in reptile venoms and well-represented in both viperid and elapid venoms  <cit> .

in addition to the proteomically verified classes of toxin, we transcriptomically identified a number of additional putative toxins that may be important components of the venom of b. irregularis . our failure to detect these proteomically may reflect a limitation of our whole-venom proteomic approach that was made necessary by the low venom yields of both of our species as discussed above. nonetheless, these remaining toxins should generally be viewed as putative and unconfirmed. hill and mackessy  <cit>  detected acetylcholinesterase  activity in the venom of b. irregularis, and we likewise detected three transcript clusters of ache . at least one of these clusters therefore probably encodes a significant venom component. acetylcholinesterase activity is generally widespread in elapid venoms  <cit>  but not viperid venoms  <cit> . these enzymes are capable of rapidly inactivating the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, thereby interfering with neuronal signaling mechanisms. our single cluster of np was expressed at high levels  and was probably not detected because of complex post-translational processing these toxins undergo  <cit> . these peptides are known to have diuretic and vasodilatory function  <cit> . we detected nine clusters of c-type lectins , but altogether these transcripts only account for  <dig> % of the toxin reads . toxic ctls possess high sequence homology with the previously discovered carbohydrate recognition domains of non-toxic c-type lectins  <cit> . many of these non-enzymatic toxins have been discovered in snake venoms. they are composed of dimers or multimers, shown to bind carbohydrate residues and are implicated in anticoagulant and platelet modulating functions. we detected four clusters of ficolins, which have been found in the transcriptome and venom proteome of the colubrid cerberus rynchops   <cit> , but they were expressed at low levels and were not detected proteomically. these putative toxins share sequence homology with the mammalian ficolin, including collagen- and fibrinogen-like domains. the bioactivity of the their non-toxic counterparts suggests that they may possess toxic lectin activity and bind n-acetylglucosamine  <cit> . we also transcriptomically detected two kunitz-type protease inhibitors , a phospholipase a <dig> , coagulation factors  vii and x, three vascular endothelial growth factors , venom factor , two waprins , one phosphodiesterase , and hyaluronidase . mackessy and hill  <cit>  explicitly tested for hyal activity in the venom of b. irregularis and failed to detect it.

combining our proteomic and transcriptomic results with previous work  <cit> , we can conclude that b. irregularis has a distinctly elapid-like, neurotoxic venom. the primary components were a diverse array of 3ftxs. cysteine-rich secretory protein, np, and ache also appeared to be significant components of the venom. snake venom metalloproteinases were also present but not particularly diverse, a pattern similar to that seen for the elapid m. fulvius <cit> . given the evolutionary propinquity of colubrids and elapids, this similarity is not surprising.

the viperid-like venom of hypsiglena
the venom of hypsiglena sp. was more similar to the hemorrhagic viperid venoms than to the neurotoxic venoms typical of its closer relatives, the elapids. by far the most abundant and diverse class of toxins in the transcriptome was the svmps. the  <dig> clusters of svmps accounted for  <dig> % of the toxin transcription and  <dig> % of the total venom-gland transcription. all  <dig> clusters of svmp were verified proteomically . this level of diversity and expression was comparable to svmps in viperids such as protobothrops flavoviridis <cit>  and crotalus adamanteus <cit> , although hypsiglena sp. only had class p-iii svmps, whereas three classes of svmp are known from viperids  <cit> .

the remaining proteomically confirmed toxins include a crisp, which at  <dig> % of the toxin transcription was the most highly expressed putative toxin. cysteine-rich secretory proteins were also detected proteomically in the venom of h. torquata texana <cit> . c-type lectins are generally common, diverse, and highly expressed in viperid venoms  <cit> , and we identified eight clusters of ctls, but only two of these were detected proteomically . finally, we detected an unusual putative toxin with kunitz-type protease inhibitor and wap domains in the transcriptome, which was later confirmed in the venom proteome. this fused toxin was similar to sequences identified in the transcriptomes of the viperids sistrurus catenatus edwardsii <cit> , protobothrops flaviviridis, and ovophis okinavensis <cit> . although we did not detect the product of the np transcript proteomically, its high expression level  suggests that this is an important component of the venom.

the remaining toxin classes probably represent minor functional components of the venom. in addition to six of the eight ctls, we also failed to detect proteomically the single 3ftx cluster, a kun, a vegf, a wap, two ficolins, a vespryn , and a pde . three-finger toxins were the major components of the venom of b. irreglaris but were represented by a single cluster accounting for just  <dig> % of the toxin reads for hypsiglena sp. weak proteomic evidence for 3ftxs in the venom of h. torquata texana has been described  <cit> , but, if 3ftxs were present in the venom of our specimen of hypsiglena sp., they were obviously very minor components.

the venom of hypsiglena sp. consisted primarily of svmps and the nonenzymatic crisp, np, and fused toxin. hill and mackessy  <cit>  tested for various enzymatic activities in the venom of h. torquata texana and were only able to detect proteolytic activity, which is in agreement with our results. with its abundant and diverse svmps and ctls, the venom of hypsiglena sp. showed a distinct similarity to typical viperid venoms, in contrast with the elapid-like venom of b. irregularis.

selection in colubrid toxins
the strongest and most consistent molecular evolutionary pattern in toxin-protein coding sequences of both elapids  <cit>  and viperids  <cit>  has been the presence of diversifying selection in the form of high ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions. sustained coevolution between snakes and their predators or prey could provide the requisite selection to drive this pattern, making this evolutionary signal a potentially powerful indicator of toxic function . to determine whether such patterns also characterized the putative toxins identified for b. irregularis and hypsiglena sp., we conducted several selection analyses. the first analysis mirrored that of rokyta et al.  <cit>  of generating null distributions of pairwise evolutionary rates on the basis of nontoxic orthologs from the venom-gland transcriptomes. from our  <dig>   and  <dig>   nontoxins, we identified  <dig>  orthologs by means of reciprocal blast. similarly, we identified  <dig> putatively orthologous toxin pairs from these two species. the toxin pairs showed significantly higher pairwise synonymous  and nonsynonymous  divergence. the toxins also showed a significantly higher ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates . we used the nontoxin distributions to generate 95% thresholds for these rates for nontoxin sequences and found that nine of the  <dig> pairs of toxins exceeded these thresholds for dn and dn/ds, but only two exceeded the ds threshold . if the toxin and nontoxin distributions were the same, we would expect to see less than one toxin pair exceed the threshold determined by the nontoxin pairs. our putative toxins therefore appeared to be evolving at higher rates than the nontoxins, particularly in terms of nonsynonymous substitutions. only three pairs of toxins  showed dn/ds> <dig>  a conservative  <cit>  indicator of positive or diversifying selection.figure  <dig>

for the larger toxin-gene families identified for b. irregularis and hypsiglena sp. , we used phylogenetic methods to determine whether positive selection was acting on sites within these genes. the svmps were the largest class with four and  <dig> representatives from hypsiglena sp. and b. irregularis, respectively . these class p-iii svmps had two functional domains in addition to the metalloproteinase domain: a disintegrin-like domain and a cysteine-rich domain. we analyzed these three domains separately for evidence of selection. for the ctls, we were only able to include  <dig> of the total  <dig> sequences because of excessive sequence divergence. using both the m1/m <dig> and m7/m <dig> model comparisons in codeml  <cit> , we identified evidence of a class of sites undergoing positive selection in all six alignments considered . in all cases, the model including a site class with dn/ds> <dig> fit significantly better than one without . the weakest evidence for positive selection came from the ficolins, which we were unable to verify as present in the venoms. in this toxin family, under both m <dig> and m <dig>  only 1% of sites were estimated to be under selection, whereas >15% of sites were estimated to be under selection for all of the other data sets. we also ran three site-based selection analyses implemented in hyphy  <cit> . all three methods detected positively selected sites for all three svmp domains . we did not detect positively selected sites for 3ftxs with single-likelihood ancestor counting , but did with fixed-effects likelihood  and random-effects likelihood . the evidence for positively selected sites was weakest for ctls and ficolins; each only had evidence under one method.table  <dig>

the evidence for diversifying or positive selection on our putative toxin sequences was mixed. we found clear evidence for positive selection in the crisps , svmps, and at least some ctls and 3ftxs . these putative toxins, perhaps not coincidentally, include most of those that were both at high levels in the venom-gland transcriptome and detected in the venom proteomes . the ficolins, which were not detected proteomically, showed weak evidence for a few sites being under selection . although this class of toxin is known from other colubrid snake species  <cit> , they may serve nontoxic functions in ours, or perhaps only a subset of those detected play a toxic role, thereby diluting the signal for selection. nonetheless, we can conclude that, like the venom components of viperids and elapids, the major types of toxins we identified in the venoms of hypsiglena sp. and b. irregularis show strong signals for diversifying selection, which is consistent with their putatively toxic roles. taxon-specific effects of b. irregularis  crude venom and purified irditoxin, a heterodimeric 3ftx, have been demonstrated toward lizards and birds, whereas mammals  show minimal effects  <cit> . our results further suggest that the venoms of colubrids contribute significantly to their fitness, despite these venoms typically having little or no medically significant effects on humans.

divergent venom phenotypes
our analyses revealed significant divergence between the two colubrids venoms, reflecting the dichotomy more typically observed between elapids and viperids. optimal foraging theory predicts that ambush predators will be stocky and generally consume relatively large food items, whereas active predators will be slim and consume smaller prey  <cit> . a number of empirical and comparative studies have demonstrated these theoretical predictions in snakes . large relative prey masses have been reported for numerous stocky-bodied viperid species, such as crotalus oreganus , bothrops moojeni , and trimeresurus stejnegeri . in contrast, small relative prey masses have been reported for slender, active foragers, particularly for arboreal rear-fanged colubrids such as psammodynastes pulverulentus  and thelotornis capensis . a mean relative prey mass of  <dig>  for hypsiglena torquata sensu lato and at least two cases of diurnal ambushing by these snakes have also been documented  <cit> , traits comparable to what has been reported in viperids. the high abundance tissue-destroying toxins typical of most viperid venoms and found in hypsiglena sp. could be critical for the rapid and efficient digestion of large prey items consumed by the ambush predators. on the other hand, the long, slender b. irregularis was reported to have a mean relative prey mass of  <dig>   <cit> , lower than even other arboreal, active foraging, rear-fanged colubrids. such small prey items are presumably simpler to digest given their higher surface area to volume ratio. selection might have favored lethal neurotoxins to subdue prey, rather than abundant tissue-dissolving toxins, in species with active foraging ecologies.

CONCLUSIONS
we presented the first comparative, high-throughput, transcriptomic analysis of the venom of two rear-fanged snakes with confirmatory peptide evidence from high-definition mass spectrometry. as previously seen for both elapids and viperids, venom expression was strongly biased towards toxin production in both b. irregularis and hypsiglena sp., suggesting that venom plays an important function in the feeding ecology of these species. this inference of ecological importance was further supported by selection analyses, which showed strong evidence of diversifying selection for the major toxin classes. although their venoms showed some diversity, these rear-fanged snakes expressed fewer toxin classes than their front-fanged counterparts. the extreme divergence observed between these two species in venom composition might be explained by their distinct foraging strategies. we also showed that, by taking advantage of high-sensitivity technologies, we can achieve complete qualitative venom characterization from single venom samples from single individual animals, despite low venom yields. although initially requiring the sacrifice of an animal for venom glands, our transcriptome-directed proteomics approach can reduce the impact on native populations by allowing identification of toxins in the venom without long-term housing of animals and the need to combine the results of multiple venom extractions.
