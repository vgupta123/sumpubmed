BACKGROUND
genetic analysis of multiply affected pedigrees has seen a resurgence of interest in the post-gwas era  <cit> . typically, in order to identify parts of the genome that segregate with a trait in a pedigree, linkage analysis is performed using haplotypes reconstructed from a large number of biallelic single nucleotide polymorphism  genotypes. although the underlying snp genotyping is robust and inexpensive, the analysis can be computationally demanding and time consuming. while effective and rapid methods exist for mapping homozygous alleles responsible for recessive traits in consanguineous families, identification of shared heterozygous variants causing dominant traits can be more computationally demanding. owing to the exponential increase in computational requirements with increasing pedigree size for exact algorithms , large families  pose a particular analytical challenge. two commonly utilised approaches include pedigree splitting  <cit> , which can result in significant loss of power  <cit> , or the use of markov chain monte carlo  approximation  <cit> . the latter can still be computationally intensive, time consuming, and can fail to converge. some of these problems have been overcome by a recent parallel implementation of the mcmc method  <cit> .

a second problem in the analysis of extended pedigrees is that if some individuals are phenocopies  this causes erroneous exclusion of the causative locus, since phenocopies lack the true disease-linked haplotype. although parametric linkage analyses can be performed under the hypothesis of a specified phenocopy rate, a priori this rate is unknown and analyses are sensitive to model misspecification  <cit>  so analyses may have to be repeated across a range of parameters and significance thresholds adjusted accordingly  <cit> . even utilising an appropriate phenocopy rate or conducting non-parametric linkage can result in failure to identify the responsible locus or prioritisation of the incorrect locus  <cit> . furthermore, including phenocopies in whole genome or whole exome sequencing strategies will similarly prevent detection  of the causative variant. these considerations have limited genetic studies in single families to those in which the phenotype is so rare or distinctive that phenocopies are extremely unlikely.

we have developed a tool called combinatorial conflicting homozygosity  that addresses these challenges. rather than calculating the likely flow of haplotypes through a family, cch uses dense snp genotypes to identify individual markers that cannot have been inherited identical-by-descent  among a set of individuals from a recent common ancestor. this allows identification of regions of the genome that contain consecutive markers in which ibd inheritance is not excluded. we show that above a threshold size  the probability that such regions are not the result of ibd inheritance becomes vanishingly small. this exclusion approach contrasts with homozygosity mapping  in which identical homozygous genotypes define the subset of the genome included in analysis. we demonstrate how cch can be used to identify regions of the genome where a single haplotype is shared by some, but not all, members of a family and that this information can be used to identify individuals harboring a heterozygous disease-linked variant in a family with multiple phenocopies, and compare cch with traditional parametric linkage analysis. unlike pedigree-based linkage methods used to analyse dominant traits, this approach is equally applicable to related and unrelated individuals or combinations thereof.

methods
cch algorithm and implementation
the underlying algorithm of cch is based on the simple, previously described principle that inheritance of at least one shared haplotype among two or more individuals is excluded by the occurrence of snps homozygous for different alleles, i.e. identical-by-state for zero alleles   <cit>  . cch uses this principle to infer ibd inheritance at loci where, in a group of individuals, ch is not observed across numerous consecutive snps. to do this, the number of consecutive snps for which ch is not observed among the individuals under consideration is summated at each locus along a chromosome. this process is then repeated for each chromosome. short runs of consecutive snps demonstrating no ch occur by chance in unrelated individuals but runs of no ch exceeding a threshold length are indicative of ibd inheritance. to militate against the effect of genotyping errors, single occurrences of ch that directly separate two loci whose combined length exceeds the pre-determined threshold are ignored. cch analysis contrasts with homozygosity mapping analyses  which are used to identify loci underlying recessive traits, both in its underlying principle  and because cch is designed to locate dominant  alleles.figure  <dig> 
conflicting homozygosity  occurs when two or more individuals are homozygous for different snp alleles  and indicates that these individuals cannot all share a haplotype spanning this snp. the absence of ch is consistent with identical by descent inheritance at that locus.



the rapidity of a single genome-wide ch analysis permits repeated analyses to be undertaken testing for ibd inheritance among all nck combinations of subsets of k from n individuals. the complete independence of each analysis permits extensive parallelisation depending on the available computational resources. cch is implemented in python and the source code, along with an example dataset and user instructions are available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/cchsnp/. this program enables analyses to be undertaken, results plotted and includes a feature to permit the generation and processing of segmented files for parallelisation. scripts to prepare input files from plink  <cit>  and high throughput sequencing  formats  <cit>  are also provided.

ch among subsets of unrelated individuals
to determine the distribution of ch among unrelated individuals we used snp genotypes corresponding to the illumina humancytosnp 12v <dig> array  of approximately  <dig>  snps taken from the hapmap project  <cit> . groups of between  <dig> and  <dig> unrelated hapmap individuals  were selected and cch was used to sequentially analyse all possible subsets of all of these groups. the analysis was repeated  <dig> times for each group size using different, randomly selected, hapmap individuals. the mean density of this snp array is approximately  <dig> snps per cm and we exclude all runs of < <dig> snps in length to prevent detecting a false positive signal from regions of the genome with sparse snp coverage.

genotyping and linkage analysis in an example family
all research involving human participants was performed with written informed consent and was approved by the ethics committee of lefkosa burhan nalbantoğlu state hospital. all participants provided informed consent for their involvement in the research in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and for the publication of the study results. individuals were genotyped on the humancytosnp 12v <dig> array  according to the manufacturers’ instructions. genotype data have been deposited in the ncbi gene expression omnibus   <cit>  and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig>  standard quality control  <cit>  was undertaken using plink  <cit>  to remove snps with >5% missingness, <5% minor allele frequency or deviation from hardy-weinberg equilibrium . snps demonstrating mendelian errors were removed. a cohort of  <dig> unrelated population-matched controls genotyped on the same array were used to prune for ld at r2 <  <dig> . from these, the snp with the highest heterozygosity within the family and lowest frequency in the controls within  <dig>  cm windows were selected. this yielded  <dig>  informative snps for linkage. affected-only parametric linkage analyses was undertaken with swiftlink  <cit>  using default parameters with a disease allele frequency of  <dig>  and variable phenocopy rates. input files for swiftlink were generated using mega <dig>  <cit> . as swiftlink utilises an mcmc estimation-based approach it is necessary to repeat each analysis a number of times and take the average lod score. each chromosome was thus analysed ten times in parallel.

RESULTS
marker diversity, linkage disequilibrium, the null distribution and ch threshold
snps with low minor allele frequency  are likely to be identical by state purely by chance, so we sought to determine whether cch might indicate apparent regions of ibd inheritance because of low marker diversity. however, since it only takes a single instance of ch to break up a haplotype, we hypothesised that cch analysis would be relatively robust to this effect: very large numbers of consecutive markers showing no ch would be required to mimic the very large  haplotypes inherited within a family. similarly, local linkage disequilibrium  between nearby markers mean that blocks of alleles tend to be inherited together even in the absence of ibd inheritance from a recent common ancestor. in the caucasian population, fewer than 10% of snps separated by  <dig> kbp  show significant evidence of ld, and where the recombination rate  is greater, the span of ld tends to be reduced  <cit> . we therefore hypothesised that such haplotype blocks would also not be large enough to mimic the very large haplotypes inherited within a family.

to test these hypotheses we examined the distributions of no ch run lengths in all possible subsets of between  <dig> and  <dig> unrelated hapmap individuals, repeated  <dig> times using different hapmap individuals. the run lengths  of no ch observed in these analyses were distributed exponentially  about a mean which varies as a function of the number of individuals being compared. the maximum observed run lengths in cm across all  <dig> analyses for each group size are plotted in figure  <dig>  across all  <dig>  ×  <dig> of these genome-wide ch analyses, when subsets comprising  <dig> or more unrelated individuals  were included, no runs comprising > <dig> snps and extending >4 cm in length were observed. since ch cannot occur among a set of individuals at a locus where a haplotype is shared  much longer runs of no ch are expected to occur in regions of the genome where there is ibd inheritance of at least one haplotype from a recent common ancestor. the length of runs arising from ibd inheritance is dependent on the size of the shared haplotype, which decreases as a function of the number of meioses separating the individuals, starting at an expected length of ~34 cm  for a pair of siblings. when related individuals  were analysed using cch, an excess of longer run lengths was observed compared with analysis of the same number of unrelated individuals . these data show that, at least with this  <dig>  snp marker set, regions of low haplotype diversity or strong ld are not large enough to generate a false-positive signal in the absence of recent shared ancestry, and therefore imply that longer runs of no ch are likely to result from ibd inheritance of a haplotype from a recent common ancestor.figure  <dig>

assessment of statistical significance
the statistical test we use to infer ibd inheritance at a given locus is the likelihood that the observed length of no ch at that locus occurred under the null hypothesis .

using the observed underlying exponential distribution of no ch run lengths  to compute these likelihoods we calculate that for  <dig> unrelated individuals, the likelihood of observing a run of length >4 cm was <10- <dig> and >7 cm was <10- <dig>  for combinatorial ch analyses, these likelihoods should be corrected for the multiple independent analyses performed . since, in a group of individuals, any ibd locus could harbor the allele responsible for a shared inherited trait, the size of the locus  does not indicate the likelihood of the allele of interest being located there. rather, it represents the likelihood that the locus is inherited ibd by all those individuals. this is equivalent in linkage terms to identifying loci which cosegregate perfectly with a trait and therefore exhibit the maximum observed lod score within a pedigree, with the magnitude of the maximum lod score depending on the certainty with which haplotypes can be inferred and the family structure. in genome-wide analyses, these ibd loci  represent the subset of the genome within which a co-segregating allele may lie. when analysing k out n individuals, the number of independent analyses, nck, is equal to n!/!). this number rises exponentially as n and n-k increase, exceeding  <dig> when n > ~ <dig> and  > ~ <dig>  this places a limit on the size of groups amenable to cch analysis due both to the computing time required for such a large number of analyses, and also the reduction in statistical power due to multiple independent tests being performed. nonetheless, cch analysis remains practical even among large groups, where < ~ <dig> phenocopies are hypothesized.

sensitivity and specificity of cch for detecting ibd inheritance
to assess the sensitivity and specificity of cch to accurately determine the maximum number of individuals ibd at a locus within a pedigree, monte carlo genome-wide gene-dropping simulations using the pedigree structure shown in figure 4a were performed using merlin  <cit>  and repeated  <dig> times. cch was run on the resulting simulated datasets, with the cm detection threshold varying between  <dig> and 8 cm . the founder source of each allele in non-founders was determined using founder-specific tags adjacent to each snp that were removed prior to cch analysis. cch was run on each genome-wide simulated dataset testing for loci shared ibd by between  <dig> and  <dig> individuals. the maximum number of individuals ibd at each snp was identified and compared with the real maximum . sensitivity was defined as the proportion of snps in ibd loci exceeding the cm threshold identified by cch as being shared by the correct number of individuals. specificity was the proportion of snps identified as ibd by cch that were genuinely ibd. cch is highly sensitive, and specificity increased with the cm threshold and the number of individuals included as assessed by comparison with ibd segments from gene-dropping simulations. using a 4 cm threshold to detect regions inherited ibd in  <dig> or more individuals genotyped with this ~ <dig>  snp array, the median sensitivity was 100%  and the specificity was  <dig> % .figure  <dig>

double recombinations
when searching for a disease-causing variant within a family, we make the assumption that the variant lies within a shared haplotype that is larger than the detection threshold – double recombination events immediately flanking the variant responsible will therefore prevent its detection by cch. however, conventional linkage analysis is similarly susceptible to this possibility: linkage is performed either with widely spaced polymorphic markers  or else with a snp chip using a thinned-out set of perhaps 5– <dig>  informative biallelic markers  where multiple consecutive markers are needed to reconstruct a haplotype with enough certainty to yield a high-magnitude lod score. this means that double-recombinations flanking small  regions will be invisible to haplotype reconstruction algorithms and are therefore missed regardless of the approach used. because recombinations occur with a median spacing of ~ <dig> cm per meiosis, when dealing with a small number  meioses in a single family, the probability of recombinations occurring so close together at the disease-causing locus is small. furthermore, because cch is robust to the existence of phenocopies, a small number of individuals in whom such a double recombination event has occurred will not prevent detection of the disease-linked haplotype in the rest of the family when cch is employed. in contrast, the whole locus will be excluded if parametric linkage analysis is performed with a non-negligible phenocopy rate.

example: an extended multiplex family with apparently autosomal dominant kidney disease
we investigated a turkish cypriot family with apparent autosomal dominant kidney disease  among  <dig> family members . no extra-renal manifestations or renal cysts were detected and no individual had undergone a kidney biopsy. endemic mutations associated with non-cystic kidney disease in the greek cypriot population  <cit>  were excluded in the proband. the  <dig> affected individuals from whom dna was available were genotyped for ~ <dig>  snps.

a genome-wide parametric linkage analysis using a subset of  <dig>  informative snps took ~105 hours of computing time run in parallel  <dig> fold  and failed to identify any loci significantly co-segregating with kidney disease . the maximum lod score was  <dig>  at a phenocopy rate of  <dig>  and reached  <dig>  at a phenocopy rate of  <dig> .

genome-wide ch analysis of all  <dig>  snps using a standard desktop personal computer took <3 seconds and identified no runs of no ch extending > <dig>  cm, consistent with no regions shared by all  <dig> affected family members. we therefore postulated one or more phenocopies and used cch to analyse all possible combinations of subsets, of progressively decreasing size, of the  <dig> clinically affected individuals with a 4 cm threshold. this indicated two loci  shared by  <dig> individuals. these loci contain no genes associated with kidney disease, so further analyses were performed on all  <dig>  possible subsets of  <dig> out of  <dig> individuals. together, these analyses took approximately 7 hours to complete serially on a desktop computer and indicated two further loci  shared by  <dig> individuals . the  <dig>  cm locus included the col4a <dig> gene and molecular testing identified, in all  <dig> individuals who shared it, a c.2611g > t substitution  in exon  <dig> of the col4a <dig> gene. this variant was absent in unaffected members of the family and the six phenocopies, including the index case. analyses of smaller subsets identified  <dig> loci shared by ≥ <dig> and  <dig> loci shared by ≥ <dig> individuals .

given that the underlying distribution of no ch run lengths conforms to an exponential distribution  the likelihood of observing, in the absence of shared inheritance, a run length of >5 cm is <10- <dig> and >7 cm is <5 × 10- <dig>  even with correction for the several thousand combinatorial analyses performed we concluded that such long run lengths were attributable to shared inheritance of a haplotype. to confirm this, haplotypes at loci identified as ibd in > <dig> individuals were reconstructed using simwalk <dig>  <cit> , and co-segregation with the relevant individuals was observed in all cases.

the col4a <dig> p.gly871cys mutation is associated with kidney disease in the greek cypriot population characterised by microscopic hematuria, with proteinuria and progressive renal dysfunction occurring in a proportion of patients in later life  <cit> . haematuria was present in all eight non-anuric individuals with the mutation and only one of the six phenocopies. we conclude that this mutation explains the kidney disease in these  <dig> family members. additional ch analysis demonstrated part of this same haplotype  in an unrelated greek cypriot individual with kidney disease who harbored the same mutation, confirming recent shared ancestry in affected individuals from these two communities.

the prevalence of clinical evidence of kidney disease  in the turkish cypriot population is not known, however one or more of these abnormalities is detectable in >16% of australian adults  <cit> . considering that clinical data were available for  <dig> family members, and given a probability of evidence of kidney disease of 16% for each person, under a binomial model that ignores any heritability, the expected number of individuals with evidence of kidney disease is  <dig> , which is greater than the six observed phenocopies. furthermore, the probability of observing > <dig> affected individuals out of  <dig> exceeds p =  <dig>  when the population prevalence is > <dig> %. this implies firstly that additional mendelian disease need not be invoked in this family to explain the observed number of phenocopies, and secondly that in other families with unexplained kidney disease a similar proportion of phenocopies may be expected.

comparison of cch with parametric linkage analysis
interrogation of the col4a <dig> locus by linkage at variable phenocopy rates from  <dig> to  <dig>  yielded a maximum lod score of  <dig>  at a phenocopy rate of  <dig>  . performing a genome-wide analysis at phenocopy rates of  <dig>  and  <dig>   identified numerous loci with lod scores exceeding zero and a smaller number with lod scores exceeding one . these loci approximately corresponded to those obtained by cch . a flow chart comparing the methodology of cch with parametric linkage is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

cch has a number of advantages over tradition linkage approaches: first, cch directly provides the exact number and identity of individuals sharing each locus . second, cch only requires genotype data for the affected individuals under examination without a need for data from unaffected connecting relatives. cch may thus be particularly useful in the context of pedigrees in which affected subjects are distantly related via individuals for whom precise relationship information and dna is unavailable. third, pre-processing of data for cch is minimal only requiring standard quality control procedures with no need to generate an informative marker subset or to provide population specific allele frequencies. formatting of the data and executing the software is therefore straightforward. finally, each genome-wide ch analysis of a subset of individuals is rapid  and completely independent the analysis of other subsets, thus permitting significant parallelisation. in the example family under study, to perform linkage analysis using swiftlink running on a four core processor took an average of ~30 minutes per chromosome. parallelised  <dig> fold, each genome-wide linkage took  <dig>  hours  with a total running time of ~110 hours. given that a priori the true phenocopy rate is unknown, this would have to be repeated multiple times at different phenocopy rates. by comparison, analysis using cch of all possible subsets comprising nine or more of the  <dig> individuals in the family  with  <dig> fold parallelisation per subset size was finished within 30 minutes , with a total running time of ~41 hours. the limit on computing time with parallel cch is simply a product of the number of available cluster nodes.

CONCLUSIONS
cch can rapidly identify the disease-linked locus in autosomal dominant disease, even in the presence of multiple phenocopies. cch is also able to detect regions of shared ancestry among ostensibly unrelated individuals using un-phased genotypes. we believe that cch should be considered in the investigation of inherited diseases where phenocopies are suspected, and may be especially powerful in detecting the location of founder mutations within isolated populations.
