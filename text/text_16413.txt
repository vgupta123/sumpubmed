BACKGROUND
quantitative pcr  is usually performed in real-time mode using fluorescence detection methods. in one commonly used format , qpcr involves three oligonucleotides wherein the forward and reverse primers direct dna amplification spanning the hybridization site for a third fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probe. the probe typically contains a fluorescence reporter dye and a quencher. separation of the reporter and quencher due to cleavage of the probe by the 5'-nuclease activity of the dna polymerase leads to an increase of fluorescence and a detectable signal  <cit> . quantitative pcr can also use nucleic acid binding dyes such as sybr® green or eva green® that increase fluorescence in the presence of double-stranded dna . nucleic acid binding dye systems use only two oligonucleotides, the forward and reverse primers, which direct amplification of the target. once amplification has occurred, the dye binds to the double stranded dna and generates a fluorescent signal without the need for a third dye-labeled oligonucleotide probe. dye binding assays are less expensive and are very convenient; however, they are inherently less specific than three-oligonucleotide systems since signal is generated from any amplification event.

formation of primer-dimers and off-target amplification are common problems in pcr  <cit> . these competing side reactions are a particular problem with low copy number targets due to the high number of cycles required for amplification and in multiplex assays where many different primers must function well together. while "primer-dimers" are often thought to arise from self-amplification of primers due to overlapping 3'-ends, these species can also be generated when there is little apparent complementarity between the primers  <cit> . more complex oligomeric products of greater length than primer-dimers are also observed in some cases  <cit> . the formation of primer-dimers can give rise to a false positive signal in dye-binding qpcr assays, and can lead to false negative results by consumption of primers and other reaction components. several methods can be used to reduce these undesired side reactions, or mitigate their effects. physical barrier methods can be used to separate reaction components until an elevated temperature is reached  <cit> . use of a chemically or antibody inactivated "hot-start" polymerase can alleviate mis-priming at low temperature, but at significant additional cost  <cit> . "nesting" of primers can detect the desired product among the previously amplified pcr products, but this technique is not applicable to qpcr. melt-curve analysis done as an additional end-point step in dye-binding qpcr assays can help demonstrate assay specificity by revealing the existence of multiple amplicons, but cannot prevent or limit their formation. often several assays must be designed and empirically tested before one is found that does not result in multiple melt peaks.

a wide variety of approaches have been employed to confer single-base specificity to pcr assays with the goal of detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> . assays have been based on either of two methods: differential amplification of the variant alleles  or discrimination between the alleles following or concurrent with unbiased amplification of the target sequence. the most common format for detection concurrent with unbiased amplification is the 5'-nuclease assay  <cit> . in that case, a fluorescence-quenched probe, which is degraded by the 5'-nuclease activity of the dna polymerase, is designed to bind preferentially to the match sequence relative to a mismatch sequence. in order to distinguish effectively between hybridization of an exact match and a single base pair mismatch, relatively short probes, 12- <dig> bases in length, are needed. to achieve binding of the probe under conditions of the extension reaction with temperatures typically between 55°c and 70°c, modified bases such as locked nucleic acids  or pendant groups such as a minor groove binder  are incorporated into the oligonucleotide to increase the tm  <cit> .

in aspcr, the snp is positioned at or near the 3'-end of the primer such that a mismatch with the template inhibits initiation of dna synthesis. even with careful optimization of reaction conditions, the success rate is highly variable. assays can be improved by incorporating modified bases or by introducing a secondary mismatch within the primer  <cit> . the most serious shortcoming of this assay format is that once extension has occurred off of a mismatched target, the primer becomes incorporated in the amplicon. after the newly synthesized strand is copied, the primer forms a perfect match with the template and no further discrimination can be achieved. even if the efficiency of replication of the template is reduced 100-fold due to the mismatch, there would only be a differential amplification of 6- <dig> cycles between alleles.

here we describe the properties of a thermophilic archaeal rnase h <dig> enzyme from pyrococcus abyssi, and methods to use this enzyme in a coupled reaction for pcr based assays  shown schematically in figure  <dig>  primers containing a single rna residue are modified at or near the 3'-end of the oligonucleotide to prevent extension by dna polymerase. deblocking and activation of the primers occur upon hybridization to the target dna sequence and subsequent cleavage by rnase h <dig>  the pyrococcus abyssi  rnase h <dig> enzyme has sufficient thermal stability and a high enough turnover rate to perform this function in real time during thermocycling. cleavage occurs at the 5'-side of the rna base leaving a dna oligonucleotide with a 3'-hydroxyl that is competent to function as a primer. p.a. rnase h <dig> has minimal activity at room temperature so that use of this enzyme in rhpcr with blocked primers enables a universal hot start reaction with any thermostable dna polymerase. little to no modification in reaction temperatures, cycling times, or analysis procedures is required for inclusion of the rnase h <dig> enzyme into current end-point pcr and qpcr methods. the requirement for hybridization of the primers to the target sequence for activation prevents template independent reactions such as the formation of primer-dimers. mismatches at or near the rna:dna base pair significantly decrease the efficiency of cleavage by rnase h <dig>  minimizing misamplification of partially homologous sequences. when utilized for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms , rhpcr was found to be far more sensitive than standard allele-specific pcr. discrimination between variant alleles is generally greatest when the mismatch is positioned at the rna:dna base pair.

RESULTS
recombinant rnase h <dig> from pyrococcus abyssi
the rnhb gene coding for the type ii rnase h from pyrococcus abyssi has been identified previously  <cit> . we produced and purified recombinant pyrococcus abyssi rnase h <dig> from e. coli as outlined in the additional methods . as expected, the enzyme was found to cleave heteroduplex substrates having a single ribonucleotide comprising any of the four rna bases. mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that cleavage occurred on the 5'-side of the rna residue, yielding one fragment with a free 3'-oh group and a second with a 5'-ribonucleotide phosphate . importantly, single-stranded rna-containing oligonucleotides were not cleaved or otherwise degraded, demonstrating the absence of any contaminating nuclease activity in the enzyme preparation.

magnesium requirements were optimized for p.a. rnase h <dig> by examining the dependence of the cleavage rates on mg2+ concentration for the single rc containing 30mer heteroduplex substrate s-rc 14-1- <dig> at 70°c. maximum activity was achieved around  <dig> mm mg2+ and high levels of activity were seen in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> mm mg2+, similar to other rnase h <dig> enzymes characterized  <cit> . the enzyme maintained over 90% activity at  <dig> mm mg2+, and only dropped to 61% of optimal activity in  <dig> mm mg2+ . no cleavage was observed in the absence of divalent cations. as with other type ii rnase h enzymes  <cit> , p.a. rnase h <dig> also has the ability to utilize mn2+ and co2+ in place of mg2+ .

the 5'-reaction product formed upon cleavage with rnase h <dig> has the structure of a normal primer used to initiate pcr reactions: the sequence is entirely dna and ends in a 3'-hydroxyl group. reaction conditions for p.a. rnase h <dig> are compatible with the buffers commonly employed in pcr . if the enzyme has sufficient thermal stability and a high enough turnover rate, then it should be possible to perform primer cleavage/activation in real time during pcr.

thermal stability and temperature dependence of pyrococcus abyssi rnase h2
to assess the thermal stability of p.a. rnase h <dig>  aliquots of the enzyme were incubated at 95°c in mg cleavage buffer for times ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes before performing a cleavage activity assay. the p.a. rnase h <dig> protein retained nearly full activity after heating at 95°c for  <dig> minutes . after  <dig> minutes incubation at 95°c, the enzyme retained 2/ <dig> of its original activity. these results demonstrate that p.a. rnase h <dig> is highly resistant to heat inactivation and will tolerate thermocycling conditions similar to those used in pcr.

the temperature-dependence of the activity of p.a. rnase h <dig> was studied by comparing the ability of the enzyme to cleave the substrate s-rc 14-1- <dig> at different temperatures between 30°c and 70°c . minimal cleavage  of the substrate was observed at 30°c, indicating that p.a. rnase h <dig> is effectively inactive at room temperature. in contrast, the p.a. rnase h <dig> enzyme cleaved over 70% of the total substrate at 70°c. the enzyme retained 64% relative activity at 60°c and 23% relative activity at 50°c. below 50°c, the enzyme rapidly lost activity. these results demonstrate that p.a. rnase h <dig> is highly active throughout the range of temperatures commonly used in pcr and is only minimally active at ambient temperatures.

effect of single base pair mismatches on substrate cleavage by p.a. rnase h2
to define the specificity of p.a. rnase h <dig> with respect to single base mismatches, a series of 30mer heteroduplex substrates having a single ribo-c base were synthesized with s-rc 14-1- <dig> serving as the perfect match control. the ribo-c containing top strand of s-rc 14-1- <dig> was hybridized to  <dig> different dna bottom strands which comprised every possible single base mutation at the rna base and at flanking positions 1- <dig> on either side of the rna residue. cleavage assays were performed and results are shown in figure  <dig>  outside positions "- <dig> to +1", the presence of a mismatch had little or no effect on cleavage by the enzyme. as has been seen with other rnase h <dig> enzymes  <cit> , the greatest effect was observed for mismatches flanking the cleavage site . a mismatch at these locations inhibited cleavage by approximately 10-fold. within the limits of detection using autoradiography, the only products observed with mismatched substrates resulted from cleavage on the 5'-side of the rna residue.

rhpcr assays using p.a. rnase h2
a  <dig> base synthetic oligonucleotide template was used as an artificial amplicon for optimization of primer design for rhpcr. initial testing of p.a. rnase h <dig> using radiolabeled substrates indicated that  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs of duplex dna 5'-to the rna residue and  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs of dna duplex 3'-to the rna base were necessary for optimal cleavage . in rhpcr , the 5'-cleavage product must be a functional primer. this ensures that more than  <dig> bases of dna are always present on the 5'-side of the rna residue. the synthetic amplicon system was employed to test the structural requirements on the 3'-side of the rna residue for efficient cleavage by rnase h <dig> during thermocycling.

a single unmodified forward  pcr primer was paired with a set of blocked-cleavable reverse  primers having different numbers of dna residues 3'-to the rna base. the rev primers all contained the same  <dig> base primer domain on the 5'-end followed by a single ribonucleotide  plus  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> dna bases complementary to the target and ended in a 3'-terminal dideoxy-cytosine . the ddc residue blocks primer extension; primer function is activated by rnase h <dig> cleavage 5'-to the ribonucleotide residue. after  <dig> cycles , reaction products were separated by page. no pcr products were produced using blocked primers in the absence of rnase h <dig>  indicating that the rev primers were inactive and did not spontaneously cleave to give rise to an active species under pcr conditions . in the presence of rnase h <dig>  amplification products were not seen for the 2-dna or 3-dna primers whereas the correct amplification product was observed using the 4-dna, 5-dna, and 6-dna primers, consistent with earlier studies of substrate cleavage by the enzyme under steady state conditions. identical results were observed when the 3'-terminus was blocked with a c <dig> propanediol spacer instead of ddc.

to examine the relative efficiency of rhpcr, real-time qpcr assays were performed with the blocked-cleavable primers using either sybr® green or the 5'-nuclease assay for detection. figure  <dig> compares results for amplification reactions using blocked cleavable "rddddx" primers  versus control unmodified primers. as before, reactions done without rnase h <dig>  showed no detectable amplification with the blocked primers. in the presence of rnase h <dig> , blocked and control unmodified primers showed identical performance. the overall shape of the amplification plots, absolute increases in relative fluorescence, and cq values  were indistinguishable. reactions were identical whether sybr® green or the 5' nuclease assays were employed for detection. in these studies, the target was present in high amounts . the blocked and unmodified primers showed identical amplification efficiency throughout a standard curve down to  <dig> copies of target . these results demonstrate that rnase h <dig> cleavage of blocked primers can proceed with sufficient speed to achieve efficient amplification and that rhpcr is compatible with real-time detection using either dye binding or probe hydrolysis assays. with an anneal/extension time of  <dig> seconds,  <dig>  mu of p.a. rnase h <dig> per  <dig> μl is required to achieve identical amplification efficiency between the blocked-cleavable primers and the control primers. a reciprocal relationship exists between the duration of the anneal/extension step and the concentration of rnase h <dig> required . for example, with an anneal/extension time of  <dig> seconds,  <dig>  mu of p.a. rnase h <dig> per  <dig> μl is needed to achieve parity between the blocked-cleavable and unmodified primers.

elimination of primer-dimer formation using rhpcr
primer-dimer and other misamplification events are a common problem in pcr and are a particular issue in sybr® green qpcr assays where false-positive signal detected from misamplified products can occur. sequence analysis, careful design of pcr primers, and use of hot start methods can reduce the frequency of primer-dimer and misamplification events, but by necessity some assays must be designed in the contexts of sequences that are not ideal. this problem is further magnified in the setting of multiplex pcr where several different primer pairs must function well together. due to the low level of activity of p.a. rnase h <dig> at room temperature , use of this enzyme in rhpcr should result in a primer-based hot-start reaction. moreover, amplification requires that the primers anneal and form a suitable heteroduplex substrate for rnase h <dig> cleavage, which should impart greater specificity to the start of the reaction than is provided by hybridization of the primer to the target alone. taken together, these two factors should mitigate the formation of primer-dimers.

to test this possibility, we studied the use of rhpcr to prevent primer-dimer formation in a hepatitis c virus  1b v <dig> system  where the need to position primers in specific areas of the viral sequence that are highly conserved between strains resulted in an assay extremely prone to the formation of primer-dimers  <cit> . a synthetic  <dig> bp hcv amplicon was cloned into a plasmid and an unmodified dna polymerase  was used for pcr. control dna primers were those previously described  <cit> . the corresponding blocked-cleavable rhpcr primers were synthesized by adding to the 3'-end of the sequence a single ribonucleotide,  <dig> dna bases complementary to the target, and a 3'-c <dig> spacer . sequences of the amplicon and the primers are shown in table s <dig> additional file  <dig>  pcr was performed with zero or  <dig> ×  <dig> copies of the hcv target plasmid, with or without rnase h <dig>  in some reactions,  <dig> ng of rat spinal cord cdna was added to provide a complex nucleic acid environment. products were examined using page and results are shown in figure  <dig>  as expected, use of the unmodified primers resulted in multiple amplified species much smaller than the expected  <dig> bp amplicon which were independent of input target. the "primer-dimer" products dominated the reaction and variable levels of the desired hcv amplicon were produced. consistent with primer-dimer formation being a stochastic event, the precise pattern varied with each reaction . amplification using the blocked-cleavable primers was dependent on the presence of rnase h <dig>  in contrast to standard pcr, rhpcr using blocked-cleavable primers produced the correct  <dig> bp amplicon when the hcv target was present and no amplified products were seen when the target was absent. use of blocked-cleavable primers in the rhpcr format totally eliminated the formation of primer-dimer artifacts in this system.

improved specificity of rhpcr with complex nucleic acid samples
the hcv example demonstrated that rhpcr improves reaction specificity by preventing primer-dimer formation , even in a system highly prone to this problem. a qpcr assay specific for the human v-ha-ras harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog  was used to test whether rhpcr could improve reaction specificity and reduce misamplification of sequences closely related to the target. hras amplification reactions were done using cdna prepared from human hela cells or from rat spinal cord. using the control primers , signal was observed with human cdna, the true target for which the primers were designed, at a cq of  <dig>  cycles and for rat cdna at a cq of 35- <dig> cycles. in contrast, with rhpcr using "rddddx" blocked-cleavable primers , signal was observed in human cdna at a cq of  <dig>  cycles and no signal was detected out to  <dig> cycles using rat cdna. thus the control primers showed a false positive signal with a Δcq of ~ <dig> cycles between human cdna  and rat cdna  while the blocked-cleavable primers gave signal only with the true target. reactions were performed again using  <dig> cycles to maximize the chance that mispriming events with the blocked primers could be detected. a false positive signal for rat cdna was eventually observed at  <dig> cycles .

the human hras control and blocked-cleavable primers are aligned against the corresponding rat hras sequences in figure 6b. in spite of multiple mismatches present in both the forward and reverse control primers, amplification from rat cdna was observed with only an  <dig> cycle delay compared to the perfect match. as a result of the presence of mismatches around the site of cleavage , both primers form poor substrates for rnase h <dig>  conferring an additional level of specificity to rhpcr and giving greatly improved performance compared to the control primers.

detection of single base pair mismatches with rhpcr
the ability of rhpcr to discriminate single base mismatches was first studied using the synthetic 103mer target sequence described above. a single unmodified for primer was paired with a set of  <dig> "rddddx" blocked-cleavable rev primers, one for each possible rna base. a set of  <dig> matching targets were synthesized placing each possible dna base at the position complementary to the rna residue. the  <dig> pairwise combinations of these primers and targets were tested for efficiency in a sybr® green qpcr assay wherein  <dig> combinations were a perfect match and the other  <dig> combinations represented every possible mismatch pairing. for comparison, a set of  <dig> traditional allele-specific pcr primers were tested where the 3'-terminal base was at the site of the polymorphism under interrogation. Δcq values  are shown in figure  <dig>  standard errors of the Δcq values were less than or equal to  <dig>  cycles in all cases except when the ra primer was paired with the g template, where the standard error was  <dig>  cycles. allele-specific pcr using the standard unmodified primers showed Δcq values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> . the rhpcr assay showed a much higher level of discrimination with Δcq values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and an average cycle delay of  <dig> . all twelve mismatches were easily detected with Δcq values greater than  <dig> cycles. two-tailed t-tests comparing the Δcq values of the unmodified versus modified primers revealed highly statistically significant p values for all combinations except ru:t vs. t:t, for which the Δcq values were nearly identical . for the remaining  <dig> mismatch combinations, the p value was less than  <dig>  except for the ra:g vs. a:g pair where the p value was calculated to be  <dig> . the t:g and g:t mismatch pairs showed the lowest Δcq values with the traditional allele-specific pcr primers as expected , since these mismatches form the most thermodynamically stable pairing  <cit> . interestingly, these pairs showed excellent discrimination in the rhpcr assay with Δcq values of  <dig>   and  <dig>  , indicating that mismatch discrimination with rhpcr is not based upon thermodynamic stability of the mismatch pair but instead relies upon enzymatic interrogation of the structure at the cleavage site. these results demonstrate the significant improvement that rhpcr offers over standard allele-specific qpcr.

the experiments shown in figure  <dig> examined the effects of a mismatch at the rna base . the effects of mismatches at the "-1" and "+1" positions on the rhpcr assay were also studied. for these experiments, blocked-cleavable rev primers were synthesized where the rna base was held constant and the dna base at position "-1" or "+1" was varied. primers were made for all  <dig> rna bases with all  <dig> dna bases at these two flanking positions. complementary oligonucleotide targets were synthesized as before. sybr® green qpcr assays were performed and Δcq values measured between the perfect match and every possible single base mismatch. results for the  <dig> primer/target pairs with a mismatch at position "-1" are shown in figure s <dig>  and those with a mismatch at position "+1" are shown in figure s <dig> . standard errors of the Δcq values were less than or equal to  <dig>  cycles in all cases. mismatch discrimination varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cycles for the "-1" series, with an average Δcq value of  <dig> . for the "+1" series, Δcq varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cycles, with an average value of  <dig> . although mismatch discrimination varied with sequence context, overall the greatest specificity was achieved by placing the mismatch opposite to the rna base .

application of rhpcr to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms in human genomic dna
a polymorphism in the human smad <dig> gene  associated with increased risk of developing colorectal carcinoma  was used as a model system to study the performance of rhpcr for snp discrimination with genomic dna. blocked-cleavable for primers  were synthesized for both alleles with the rna base positioned at the snp site. the rs <dig> snp is a c/t variation. the "c-allele" primer will form a rc:g pair for the match and rc:a for the mismatch. the "t-allele" primer will form a ru:a pair for the match and ru:g for the mismatch. these mismatch combinations showed mid-range discrimination in the synthetic amplicon system having Δcq values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . unmodified allele-specific primers were also synthesized where the snp site was positioned at the 3'-terminal base or the penultimate residue. a non-discriminatory control primer which ended at the "-1" position immediately 5'-to the snp was used as a control. this set of for primers was used with a single unblocked rev primer to perform qpcr using sybr® green detection with human genomic dna as template from known homozygotes for each allele at this locus . results are summarized in table  <dig>  standard errors were all less than or equal to  <dig>  cycles. the unmodified allele-specific primers showed almost no difference between the matched and mismatched targets whether the snp site was located at the 3'-terminus or the penultimate residue . in contrast, blocked-cleavable primers with the rna base positioned opposite the snp site showed a large delay in amplification between the matched and the mismatched alleles; average Δcq values between the mismatched and matched targets were  <dig>  and  <dig>  cycles for the "c-allele" and "t-allele" primers, respectively. a 2-tailed t-test evaluation of these results showed that this was a highly statistically significant improvement compared to the unmodified primers .

amplification reactions were performed in real-time mode using sybr® green detection and either homozygous c/c or homozygous t/t human genomic dna. reactions were run in triplicate; average cq values are shown. Δcq represents the difference between the cq value for the mismatched reaction minus the cq value for the matched reaction. sequences at the 3'-end of the primers are shown. dna bases are uppercase and rna bases are bold lowercase. the c <dig> spacer blocking group is indicated by "x". the location of the mismatch in the primer compared to the target nucleic acid is underlined.

studies using the synthetic amplicon system suggested that placing the snp site opposite the rna base  generally gave the highest mismatch discrimination; however, when the snp site was placed at positions "-1" or "+1" the Δcq was also very favorable in some cases. to determine the optimal position of the snp site within the blocked-cleavable primer in the sequence context of the smad <dig> rs <dig> snp, primers were synthesized for both the c and t alleles placing the snp site at the "-1" and "+1" positions relative to the rna base. as with the synthetic template, placing the snp at the rna base  gave the best results. blocked-cleavable primers with the snp at the "-1" position performed very poorly with Δcq values of less than  <dig> . these results were not statistically different from results obtained with the unmodified primers. placing the snp site at the "+1" position gave intermediate results with Δcq values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the "c-allele" and "t-allele" primers, respectively. these results represented a statistically significant improvement over the unmodified primers but reflected decreased specificity when compared with blocked-cleavable primers having the mismatch placed opposite the rna residue .

in all of these experiments, thermocycling was performed using a 60°c anneal/extension temperature. standard unmodified allele-specific primers may be more dependent upon using an optimized reaction temperature than the rhpcr method, so the experiments were repeated with anneal/extension temperatures ranging from 60°c to 70°c. results with the unmodified primers were slightly better at elevated anneal temperatures, but in no case did the Δcq between the matched and mismatched targets exceed  <dig> cycles . experiments performed using the blocked-cleavable primers also showed little improvement in mismatch discrimination by increasing the reaction temperature above 60°c.

in traditional qpcr and pcr reactions, it is occasionally necessary to employ a primer annealing temperature lower than 60°c due to sequence context constraints imposed by the natural nucleic acid targets. to determine whether the lower enzymatic activity of p.a. rnase h <dig> seen at temperatures below 60°c would affect the efficiency of rhpcr or mismatch discrimination, amplification reactions were repeated with the smad <dig> rs4939827-specific blocked-cleavable primers at annealing temperatures of 55°c or 50°c . only a small decrease in amplification efficiency of rhpcr was observed at 50°c with no significant effect on mismatch discrimination. thus, in spite of the reduction of activity of the p.a. rnase h <dig> enzyme as the reaction temperature is lowered from 60°c to 50°c , the efficiency and specificity of rhpcr remains remarkably stable throughout this temperature range.

use of rhpcr in genotyping
a collection of  <dig> human dna samples of known identity at the smad <dig> rs <dig> snp locus were obtained from the coriell repository. this set comprised  <dig> c/c homozygotes,  <dig> t/t homozygotes, and  <dig> c/t heterozygotes. these  <dig> samples were tested in the rhpcr assay as described above using "rddddx" blocked-cleavable primers with the snp positioned at the rna base  in a blinded fashion using  <dig> ng input genomic dna and  <dig>  mu of the p.a. rnase h <dig> enzyme. the assays were first run in real-time mode using sybr® green detection. results are shown in figure 8a. all  <dig> human dna samples were easily stratified into  <dig> classes  and each genotype was correctly identified.

the rhpcr assay was clearly effective at discriminating these  <dig> genotypes when run with the benefit of the high precision offered by real-time detection. for high throughput applications, it is more efficient to process plates in batch format and read fluorescence in an end-point mode. the above experiment was therefore repeated running the reaction for  <dig> cycles and fluorescence was measured at this point; raw fluorescence values were plotted for each sample and are shown in figure 8b. each dna sample was run in triplicate, so the fluorescence measurements include  <dig> data points. once again, all  <dig> human dna samples  were easily stratified into  <dig> classes  and each genotype was correctly identified. as more amplification cycles are performed, signal from mismatched targets will eventually increase. at  <dig> cycles the correct genotypes of all samples were still easily identified, but by  <dig> cycles the boundaries between homozygote and heterozygote samples began to merge . by limiting the reaction to  <dig> cycles or less , rhpcr can be used for genotyping applications in an end-point format.

discussion
primer cleavage dependent pcr
several coupled reaction schemes have been proposed for pcr in which a hybridization dependent primer activation step is linked to primer extension. in the pyrophosphorolysis-activated polymerization  assay  <cit> , a blocked 3'-terminal nucleotide is cleaved by attack of pyrophosphate . for this to occur efficiently, high concentrations of pyrophosphate are required which may inhibit some polymerases. the range of blocking groups that can be accommodated at the 3'-terminus is very limited. a 3'-terminal dideoxynucleotide has been utilized in most studies  <cit> . of the four bases, only dideoxy-c can be readily incorporated using standard methods of oligonucleotide synthesis, limiting widespread use of this technique.

a coupled pcr assay has been proposed in which a blocked primer is cleaved after hybridization to the target sequence by a nicking restriction endonuclease  <cit> . a restriction enzyme that has an asymmetric recognition sequence or that cuts only one strand at a hemimethylated site would be required to avoid cleavage of the template. to our knowledge, this reaction scheme has never been demonstrated experimentally. in any event, the requirement that the restriction enzyme recognition sequence be located near the 3'-end of the primer would severely limit the use of this method.

use of both rnase h <dig> and rnase h <dig> to effect primer cleavage in a coupled pcr assay has been reported previously in the patent literature but minimally characterized  <cit> . unlike the type ii rnase h enzymes, type i enzymes will not cleave a substrate having a single rna residue. at least  <dig> consecutive rna residues are required, and  <dig> for a high level of catalytic activity  <cit> . thus, use of a type i rnase h in rhpcr would require that the primer have at least four consecutive rna residues. this adds substantially to the cost and complexity of the synthesis of the primer and increases its susceptibility to degradation. the cleaved primer would terminate in two or more rna residues which can inhibit primer extension and these rna residues would be incorporated into the amplicon. sagawa et al.  <cit>  suggested that the specificity of type ii rnases h would be similar to that of a restriction enzyme and that cleavage, and hence amplification, would be completely prevented if there was a mismatch at the rna:dna base pair within the duplex formed between the primer and the template. although this is not true, as seen in the present study, coupling rnase h <dig> cleavage to primer extension can be used to greatly boost the specificity of pcr.

use of p.a. rnase h <dig> in rhpcr
the thermostability and temperature dependence of p.a. rnase h <dig> makes it well suited for use in rhpcr. the activity of the enzyme is unaffected by heating at 95°c for  <dig> minutes . critically, this level of resistance to heat inactivation is sufficient for use in pcr, even for reactions requiring an extended number of cycles and a sustained initial incubation at 95°c. to demonstrate this explicitly, p.a. rnase h <dig> was pre-cycled in pcr buffer for  <dig> cycles , then all reaction components were added and rhpcr was performed . the reaction efficiency was unchanged, indicating that the enzyme's thermal stability is sufficient to remain active throughout the range of use expected for all pcr applications. a further advantage of p.a. rnase h <dig> is that it is essentially inactive at temperatures below 30°c . this effectively confers a hot start to reactions done using blocked-cleavable primers and any thermostable dna polymerase. in addition, p.a. rnase h <dig> has sufficient activity at 50°c to support rhpcr, permitting the reaction to be performed throughout a broad temperature range .

like other type ii rnase h enzymes, p.a. rnase h <dig> retains a high level of activity at concentrations of mg2+ as low as  <dig> mm  <cit> , enabling rhpcr to be performed at all magnesium concentrations typically employed in pcr. the enzyme is able to cleave heteroduplex substrates with a single ribonucleotide comprising any of the four bases. cleavage also occurs at a riboa:deoxyu base pair , allowing the uracil-n-glycosylase  sterilization method to be used in rhpcr assays. although reaction rates are slightly affected by the identity of the rna base and the flanking dna sequence, a single concentration of the enzyme and set of reaction conditions generally can be used regardless of the sequence of the target. the efficiency of primer cleavage is principally determined by the structure of the primer 3'-to the rna base and the degree of complementarity present near the scissile linkage.

it is important to note that non-specific hydrolysis of the rna linkage cannot lead to primer activation. water catalyzed hydrolysis and enzymatic cleavage by contaminating single-strand specific ribonucleases both lead to the formation of a cyclic 2'-3'-phosphodiester at the 3'-terminus. this group blocks the 3'-end of the oligonucleotide and prevents primer extension. spontaneous hydrolysis of the cyclic phosphodiester gives a mixture of 2'- and 3'-phosphate monoesters; enzymatic hydrolysis yields exclusively the 3'-phosphate. in either case, primer extension remains blocked. background cleavage of the ribonucleotide linkage is problematic only if it occurs to such an extent that the amount of the primer is substantially depleted. although divalent cations  can facilitate water catalyzed hydrolysis of rna containing oligonucleotides, especially at elevated temperatures  <cit> , non-enzymatic degradation of primers containing a single rna residue under thermocycling conditions used in pcr is negligible. if there is significant contamination of a sample with single-stranded ribonucleases, inhibitors such as human placental rnase inhibitor can be included in the reaction mixture as they do not affect the activity of rnase h enzymes. in our experience, this has not been necessary.

recognition of substrates having base-pair mismatches by type ii rnase h enzymes
rnase h <dig> plays an important role in the removal of rna residues misincorporated into dna due either to incomplete removal of rna primers used to initiate dna synthesis or polymerase errors  <cit> . consistent with its role in dna repair, type ii rnase h enzymes are also able to cleave substrates where there is an rna:dna base pair mismatch, but at a rate reduced compared to the corresponding perfect duplex  <cit> . for p.a. rnase h <dig>  the rate of the reaction is decreased by about 10-fold . a decrease in rate of similar magnitude is seen with a mismatch on the 5'-side of the cleavage site . mismatches at the "-3", "-2", and "+1" positions gave rise to smaller reductions in the cleavage rate. outside of this region, effects of a base pair mismatch were negligible. in all cases, the only products observed by mass spectrometry, and by electrophoresis using radiolabeled substrates, reflected cleavage on the 5'-side of the rna residue. more detailed kinetic studies of the effects of mismatches on cleavage rates are in progress.

enhanced specificity of rhpcr
coupling cleavage by rnase h <dig> to primer extension in rhpcr leads to greater specificity both with respect to template independent mispriming events  and unwanted amplification of related sequences. the formation of primer-dimers is prevented even in assays that are very prone to this side reaction . this feature of rhpcr should be particularly beneficial in multiplex assays. the specificity of the assay with respect to misamplification of homologous sequences is far greater than can be achieved by pcr using unmodified primers. when there are mismatches over or neighboring the rnase h <dig> cleavage sites of both primers, the Δcq values observed are extremely large. for the hras gene, the Δcq between the rat and human sequences was greater than  <dig> cycles. this high degree of specificity should be very useful for the detection of low levels of heterologous dna in xenogeneic transplant models  and in other instances where there are related targets having closely spaced variations in sequence. in snp detection, where it is necessary to exploit the effect of a single base pair mismatch on cleavage by rnase h <dig>  the assay also shows far greater discrimination than can be achieved with standard allele-specific pcr.

use of rhpcr for genotyping
several groups have employed rnase h in snp discrimination assays using unbiased amplification of the target sequence linked to cleavage of an rna-containing probe. harvey, han, and colleagues described the use of a thermostable rnase h <dig> enzyme in genotyping assays where cleavage of a fluorescence-quenched probe having four sequential rna bases was used to discriminate base identity  <cit> . the assay was coupled to pcr and cleavage of the probe occurred in real time during thermocycling, as in a 5'-nuclease assay. the type ii rnase h enzymes from chlamydia pneumonia  and from thermus thermophilus  have been used for snp detection where a molecular beacon having a single rna residue specific for the mutation site was cleaved following pcr in an end-point assay  <cit> .

in rhpcr the discrimination between variant alleles relies on differential amplification of the matched and mismatched target sequences. the specificity of the assay is generally greatest when the rna residue of the primer is placed over the snp site. in a model system using "rddddx" blocked-cleavable primers, all  <dig> possible base pair mismatches were readily detected . the average Δcq was  <dig>  using the same set of reaction conditions in each assay. with unmodified allele-specific primers, the average Δcq was only  <dig> .

the application of rhpcr to genotyping of genomic dna samples was investigated with the smad <dig> rs <dig>  snp locus. individuals homozygous for the t/t allele are at increased risk for the development of colon cancer. with unmodified allele-specific primers, there was almost no discrimination between the two alleles , precluding the use of traditional aspcr for genotyping at this locus. with rhpcr, the two alleles were easily distinguished. using "rddddx" primers with the rna residue positioned over the snp site, the Δcq between matched and mismatched targets was approximately  <dig> for both the "t-allele" and "c-allele" specific primers. the three genotypes  could be distinguished unambiguously. in a blinded study of  <dig> dna samples representing different individuals, all were correctly identified. the assay was robust with both real-time and end-point modes of detection .

in studies with both a synthetic template  and the smad <dig> snp locus , rhpcr primers with the mutation site located 5'-to the rna base  were less discriminatory than primers where the rna base was placed over the snp site. in the case of the smad <dig> locus, rhpcr primers with the snp site at the "-1" position provided almost no differentiation between the two alleles, similar to unmodified allele-specific primers. at first, it might seem that placing the mutation site on the 5'-side of the rna base would be optimal, providing discrimination both at the rnase h <dig> cleavage step and at the initiation of dna synthesis. in contrast, with the rna base opposite the mutation site , the primer forms a perfect match to the template after rnase h <dig> cleavage, offering no opportunity for further distinction between the two alleles. however, in the former case, if primer cleavage and extension do occur on a mismatched template, the alternate allele is incorporated into the extension product and a new amplicon is created which is now a perfect match to the primer. as a result, a 10-fold decrease in the cleavage rate by rnase h <dig> can contribute at most a 3- <dig> cycle increase in the cq value. on the other hand, if the rna base is positioned opposite the mutation site, the mismatched template should be replicated faithfully. when this occurs, the effect of the mismatch becomes amplified with each cycle and produces a much greater increase in the value of Δcq. for convenience, additional file  <dig> contains a merged set of all of the additional files.

other applications for thermostable rnase h <dig> in molecular biology
rnase h <dig> can also be used to increase the specificity of dna ligation assays . oligonucleotide ligation assays  employ two oligonucleotides  which are designed to hybridize adjacent to each other on a complementary target nucleic acid so that dna ligase can join the two fragments  <cit> . the formation of this new longer species is detectable by a variety of means including pcr and fluorescent bead capture. an added degree of specificity for snp detection relies upon the ability of dna ligase to distinguish between a perfect match and mismatched base pair at or near the site of ligation. donor and/or acceptor oligonucleotides can be designed that are modified to prevent ligation and contain an internal rna residue near the ligation site. blocking groups on the acceptor oligonucleotide useful to inhibit ligation are the same as those used to prevent primer extension. as with the blocked-cleavable primers used in rhpcr, cleavage of the blocked-cleavable ola oligonucleotide will result in a free 3'-hydroxyl which can function as an acceptor for a 5'-phosphate during ligation. cleavage of the donor oligonucleotide by rnase h <dig> will result in a 5'-ribophosphate, which will also function efficiently in ligation  <cit> . this coupled reaction scheme could be employed to improve the specificity of olas for nucleic acid detection or genotyping.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we describe here a pcr method  that couples activation of blocked-cleavable primers by p.a. rnase h <dig> with amplification. the new rhpcr method simplifies primer design by eliminating the formation of primer-dimers and markedly enhances the specificity of pcr with respect to off-target amplification of closely related sequences. there is no change in workflow and use of a less expensive non-hot start dna polymerase may actually result in a reduction in assay costs. in addition to its use in genotyping, the assay should find utility in improving the function of highly multiplexed assays where many different primers must work well together without unwanted interactions , in rare allele detection where the added specificity of the blocked-cleavable primers enables detection of a desired mutant allele in the face of increasingly large amounts of wild type dna , and in library construction for next generation dna sequencing methods to reduce contamination of libraries with primer dimer "blank reads".
