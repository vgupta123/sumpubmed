BACKGROUND
hepatitis c virus  infection is a global health problem and a leading cause of liver disease in north america  <cit> . previous studies have indicated that genes associated with cellular metabolic pathways are involved in the hcv life cycle. hcv infection causes the accumulation of lipid droplets  in patients' hepatocytes, a process called steatosis  <cit> . both the hcv core protein and nonstructural protein ns5a are localized to lds, replication complexes have been demonstrated to be located in ld-associated membranes, and that this recruitment is critical for producing infectious viruses  <cit> . additionally, the expression of core protein in the liver of transgenic mice causes the development of steatosis  <cit> .

altering the host cell environment by using small molecules and other functional genomic approaches has been demonstrated to modulate hcv replication through diverse mechanisms  <cit> . depletion of cholesterol using β-cyclodextrin disrupts the membranous web upon which hcv replication occurs  <cit> . inhibitors of hmg-coa reductase, the rate-controlling enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, like lovastatin and fluvastatin, also inhibit hcv replication  <cit> . in addition, small molecule inhibitors such as 25-hydroxycholesterol  and cerulenin, both of which act at the mevalonate pathway, also inhibit hcv replication  <cit> . ggti- <dig>  an inhibitor of geranylgeranylation, inhibits hcv replication  <cit> , and fbl <dig> has been implicated as a geranylgeranylated host protein required for hcv rna replication  <cit> . the ppar receptor antagonist 2-chloro-5-nitro-n-benzamide also modulates hcv replication  <cit> . collectively, these observations implicate a direct role of cellular lipid metabolism in the hcv life cycle and suggest that further insight into host cell metabolic determinants for the hcv life cycle may help to define new strategies for the development of antiviral therapeutics.

gene expression profiling has been used to study hcv-associated liver pathologies, including cirrhosis  <cit> , fibrosis  <cit> , and hepatocellular carcinoma   <cit> . other researchers have used microarrays to elucidate the mechanism underlying ifn resistance  <cit>  and the molecular basis for treatment failure of pegylated ifnα plus ribavirin  <cit> . the progression of hcv infection has also been studied by transcriptional profiling of liver biopsies in acutely infected chimpanzees that developed persistent infection, transient viral clearance, or sustained clearance, and common as well as outcome-specific changes in gene expression were observed  <cit> . transient and sustained viral clearance was associated with the induction of ifnγ- induced genes, antigen processing and presentation genes, and genes associated with the adaptive immune response  <cit> . host genes involved in lipid metabolism were also differentially regulated during the early stages of infection and these genes correlated with the outcome of infection  <cit> . these observations are particularly important given that hcv-derived steatosis is correlated with more rapid disease progression and reduced response to antiviral therapy clinically  <cit> . herein we have performed gene expression profiling of huh- <dig> cells harbouring hcv replicons in the absence and presence of the mevalonate pathway inhibitor 25-hc  and examined which differentially regulated genes lead to an antiviral state in the replicon model. the changes in gene expression in the replicon model were compared with the gene expression profiles in hcv infected chimpanzees to evaluate their role in hcv pathogenesis.

RESULTS
we performed transcriptome profiling using u133a affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide arrays on rna samples prepared from huh- <dig> cells bearing hcv replicons in the presence of 25-hc, an inhibitor of the mevalonate pathway. the transcriptional profiling was carried out using crna prepared from four treatment groups:  naïve huh- <dig> cells;  naïve huh- <dig> cells treated with 25-hc;  huh- <dig> cells transiently transfected with pfk-i389neo/ns3-3'/ <dig>  or replicon rna from pfk-i389neo/ns3-3'/Δ5b replicon rnas ; and  huh- <dig> cells transiently transfected with pfk-i389neo/ns3-3'/ <dig>  or pfk-i389neo/ns3-3'/Δ5b replicon rnas and treated with 25-hc as indicated in fig. 2b. the experiments were performed analogously to previous studies of antiviral small molecules on hcv replication  <cit> . as previously reported  <cit> , the treatment of huh- <dig> cells bearing hcv replicons with 25-hc caused a dose-dependent decrease in hcv replication at non-toxic concentrations as measured by firefly luciferase activity in huh- <dig> cells transfected with hcv replicon rna from pfk-i389luc/ns3-3'/ <dig>  .

comparisons were conducted between each set of duplicate data to determine which genes were differentially expressed in 25-hc-treated huh- <dig> cells and in the 25-hc-treated hcv replicon cells. the ratios of average expression for 25-hc treated huh- <dig> cells/naïve huh- <dig> cells were used to compute the fold change values for the 25-hc treated column table  <dig>  similarly the 25-hc-treated hcv replicon column in table  <dig> was computed from the ratio of average expression values from /replicon samples. transcriptome profiling of huh- <dig> cells treated with 25-hc demonstrated that  <dig> genes were differentially regulated. forty-seven genes were downregulated,  <dig> of which are clearly related to the mevalonate pathway . a number of membrane proteins and oligonucleotide-binding proteins also appear to be downregulated . by contrast, only  <dig> upregulated genes were observed upon treatment with 25-hc . none of these genes are directly involved in the mevalonate pathway and there appears to be no functional relationship between the entries within table  <dig>  these observations suggest that 25-hc acts at the transcriptional level as a negative regulator of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis  <cit> , and that other changes in gene expression observed occur as secondary effects of 25-hc treatment. it is interesting to note that huh- <dig> cells treated with both hcv replicon rna and 25-hc did not show identical transcriptional profiles to cells treated analogously without hcv replicon rna or to those only treated with hcv replicon rna or replication-defective replicon rna . specifically,  <dig> genes were uniquely upregulated and  <dig> genes were uniquely downregulated in the 25-hc-treated hcv replicon harbouring cells . virtually all the genes in table  <dig> are hypothetical transcripts or genes of unknown function. collectively the global gene expression changes represented by tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  represent the transcriptional program that leads to an antiviral state within the host cell hepatocyte, at least for the subgenomic hcv replicon. one or more of these genes may serve as prognostic markers for hcv treatment. therefore, we performed further studies to investigate the importance of the observed gene expression changes in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> in other models for hcv pathogenesis.

a fold change was calculated from the average of two independent hybridizations on u133a affymetrix genechip arrays compared with an average expression value from analogous hybridizations from control cells that were not treated with 25-hc. fold change for 25-hc-treated column was determined from the ratio of expression in 25-hc treated huh- <dig> cells/naïve huh- <dig> cells and for the 25-hc-treated hcv replicon column from the ratio of expression values from /replicon. b italicized entries are known to be involved in the mevalonate pathway. dashes  indicate genes whose fold-change in gene expression did not exceed  <dig> -fold and hence were omitted from the analysis.

we examined the transcriptional profiles of the genes from this study in three previously studied chimpanzees that were infected with hcv resulting in different outcomes of infection  <cit>  and for whom genome-wide transcriptional analyses were performed during the course of infection  <cit> . briefly, one chimpanzee successfully cleared the virus , one became persistently infected but initially transiently cleared the virus , and the third chimpanzee developed an unrestrained persistent hcv infection  in the absence of both an intrahepatic antiviral immune response and ifn-γ induction  <cit> . genome-wide transcriptional profiling did suggest that the induction of both immunological and hepatocellular genes can influence the course and outcome of hcv infection  <cit> . both the sc and tc chimpanzees displayed an altered lipid metabolism profile during the initial rise in viremia following inoculation with hcv as revealed by gene expression profiling, whereas the ps chimpanzee did not  <cit> .

to determine which genes from our study were most relevant in the context of hcv infection in the chimpanzee model, we compared genes identified in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> with those of the chimpanzee data sets described previously  <cit> . to this end, we compared the replicon data sets  with the most representative chimpanzee data sets, those containing genes that changed significantly during the initial rise in viremia , since both involve an initial host response to viral rna and both involve the modulation of lipid metabolism genes. from the  <dig> differentially regulated genes identified here and the  <dig> genes derived from transcriptome profiling of infected chimpanzees during the initial rise in viremia  <cit> , we identified  <dig> overlapping genes. these genes were further analyzed based on outcome-specific gene expression profiles, fold-induction in chimpanzees during the initial rise in viremia, function as determined by bioinformatically and using the symatlas at , and using the ingenuity interaction software. the four genes selected for further study were prospero-related homeobox  <dig> , insulin induced gene  <dig> , natural killer cell transcript  <dig> , and diubiquitin , table  <dig> 

a comparisons were made with data collected from reference  <cit>  for transcriptional profiles of  <dig> chimpanzees with different outcomes of viremia. see reference  <cit>  for the details of the experiments for transcriptional profiling. the transcriptional profiling data from reference  <cit>  was simply mined for the relevant data presented in this table; b multiple insig <dig> accessions correspond to the three insig <dig> probes; c initial rise in viremia indicates gene expression levels at timepoint  <dig> after infection over timepoint  <dig> just prior to infection for each chimpanzee. dashes  indicate genes whose fold-change in gene expression did not exceed  <dig> -fold and hence were omitted from the analysis. n/a indicates transcripts that were not assessed in the chimpanzee gene expression profiles.

the prox <dig> gene is a transcription factor expressed in the adult human liver that is involved in hepatocyte specification, proliferation, differentiation, and migration  <cit> . it is also involved in control of bile acid synthesis and cholesterol homeostasis in vivo  <cit> . since hcv replication has been demonstrated to be linked with cellular lipid metabolism, and the prox <dig> gene was found to have interesting expression patterns in previous gene expression studies carried out in chimpanzee  <cit> , the prox <dig> gene was chosen for further validation in the hcv replicon cells. in the replicon data set, prox <dig> was downregulated in hcv replicon cells compared with naïve huh- <dig> cells . the prox <dig> gene is downregulated in replicon-harbouring cells compared to naïve huh- <dig> cells and represents a class of genes that may be negatively regulated during hcv replication. interestingly, prox <dig> is upregulated in tc and sc during the initial rise in viremia, but negatively regulated in ps .

the insig- <dig> is highly expressed in the adult liver and plays a role in sterol homeostasis. insig- <dig> was downregulated in 25-hc-treated hcv replicon cells compared with hcv replicon-harbouring cells . insig- <dig> represents a class of genes that are negatively regulated during hcv replication under metabolic conditions that are induced by the inhibitor of the mevalonate pathway, 25-hc. this transcript is also upregulated in an outcome-specific manner in the chimpanzee who experienced a clearance episode  but not in that which resulted in a persistent  infection .

the nk <dig> gene was chosen for further validation because its expression seems to be correlated with a clearance state in the chimpanzee and it was found to be upregulated in the 25-hc-treated hcv replicon cells compared with naïve huh- <dig> cells treated with 25-hc . unlike prox <dig> and insig <dig>  nk <dig> represents a class of genes that are induced upon hcv replication and appears to be modulated by treatment with 25-hc.

finally, the ubd gene was chosen for further validation because its expression was increased dramatically in the chimpanzees associated with sustained and transient clearance, 43-fold and 7-fold, respectively, and it was upregulated in 25-hc-treated hcv replicon cells compared with naïve huh- <dig> cells treated with 25-hc . ubd represents a class of genes that are induced during hcv replication when an antiviral state exists within the host cell, as demonstrated by the increase in expression in hcv replicon harbouring cells treated with 25-hc. this gene may serve as a prognostic marker for hcv infection.

next we examined the overall gene expression patterns for these four genes  in the tc, sc, and ps chimpanzees. the expression levels of the four genes in infected chimpanzees were plotted as a function of time alongside the hcv rna levels measured in the chimpanzees  <cit>  . the comparative analysis between the chimpanzee and replicon data sets was done based on the first three chimpanzee time points, which corresponded to the initial rise in viremia  <cit> . however, the expression of the four genes of interest was determined and plotted for the entire measured time course of infection for the chimpanzees in fig.  <dig>  in general, the gene expression levels of the four genes paralleled the hcv levels in the chimpanzees that displayed sustained clearance  and transient clearance  of hcv. the overall gene expression levels were lowest in the persistently infected  chimpanzee compared to the sc and tc chimpanzees. also, the overall gene expression levels were higher for all four genes in the tc chimpanzee, which also had the highest viral titres .

expression of prox <dig> in the hcv-infected chimpanzees early post-infection decreased slightly within the first six days for the sc chimpanzee, increased within the first eight days in the tc chimpanzee, and decreased within the first eight days in the ps chimpanzee . throughout the remaining course of infection, prox <dig> levels roughly correlated with hcv levels in the sc and tc chimpanzees, while in the ps chimpanzee the prox <dig> levels remained lower than the hcv levels. the expression level of insig- <dig> early post-infection increased in the sc and tc chimpanzees while it varied only slightly within the first eighteen days post-infection in the ps chimpanzee . thereafter, the insig- <dig> levels closely paralleled the hcv rna levels in the sc and tc chimpanzees and rose to meet the hcv level in the ps chimpanzee. the nk <dig> levels during the initial rise in viremia in the chimpanzees paralleled the rising hcv levels in the sc and tc chimpanzees . in contrast, in the ps chimpanzee the nk <dig> levels decreased within the first eight days of infection and then increased along with the rising hcv rna level. finally, the ubd pattern of expression basically paralleled the levels of hcv rna in the sc and tc chimpanzees with some variation in the absolute levels of expression relative to that of the hcv rna . in the ps chimpanzee, the ubd expression level remained close to baseline levels in the first eighteen days post-infection, and then the ubd expression steadily increased during the remaining time course of hcv infection.

to ascertain the importance of the four genes for hcv replication, sirna knockdown and overexpression studies were carried out in huh- <dig> cells harbouring hcv replicon rna. rt-pcr and northern blot analyses were used to confirm sirna and overexpression vector function in each case . huh- <dig> cells stably expressing neo/luc/ns3-3'/ <dig>  hcv replicons  <cit>  were treated with sirnas against the four genes in the absence or presence of 25-hc . as controls, the hcv replicon cells were also treated with gl <dig> and gl <dig> sirnas, a positive control that targets the luciferase gene expressed from the hcv replicon rna and a negative control, respectively, in addition to ifnγ treatment  <cit> . interestingly, although the prox <dig> sirna did not affect hcv replication on its own, it enhanced the inhibitory effect of treatment with  <dig> μm 25-hc when compared to mock-transfected replicon cells treated with  <dig> μm 25-hc  as indicated . overexpression of prox <dig> in replicon cells did not affect hcv replication . knockdown of insig- <dig> with homologous sirnas did not affect hcv replication in replicon cells either in the absence or presence of 25-hc . similarly, overexpression of insig- <dig> in replicon cells did not affect hcv replication . although the transcriptional profiling showed that nk <dig> was upregulated in replicon cells treated with 25-hc, sirna knockdown of nk <dig> did not affect hcv replication . however, overexpression of nk <dig> affected hcv replication in the presence of 25-hc treatment, causing a significant decrease in hcv replication compared to replicon cells that were transfected with the backbone β-gal control vector and treated with 25-hc . from the profiling data, ubd was upregulated in 25-hc-treated replicon cells compared with naïve huh- <dig> cells treated with 25-hc. however, neither knockdown of ubd using sirna duplexes  nor overexpression of ubd  had an affect on hcv replication.

to determine if sirna treatment or overexpression had any affect on the expression of the hcv nonstructural proteins ns <dig> and ns5a, huh- <dig> cells stably expressing neo/ns3-3'/ <dig>  replicons were transiently transfected with sirna or overexpression constructs and western blot analyses were conducted. as expected, sirna knockdown of prox <dig> gene expression resulted in complete loss of prox <dig> protein expression . however, knockdown of prox <dig> expression did not have any affect on ns <dig> or ns5a protein levels . corresponding to their negative effect on hcv replication, ifnγ and 25-hc treatment of replicon cells caused a decrease in the levels of ns <dig> and ns5a, with the effect being more pronounced for ns5a as we had previously reported  <cit> . interestingly, overexpression of insig- <dig> caused an increase in the levels of both hcv non-structural proteins . overexpression of nk <dig> and ubd had no effect on the levels of hcv non-structural proteins .

discussion
several examples now exist whereby hcv replication can be modulated or even cured by the targeting of host cell pathways rather than through the direct targeting of the virus  <cit> . any perturbation of a host cell pathway that is harnessed or diverted by hcv during its life cycle has the potential to be an antiviral target, particularly if it is not an essential pathway to cell function. small molecule probes have been used to block hcv replication by preventing the replication complexes from forming  <cit> , by the selective inhibition of host cell kinases  <cit> , by targeting nuclear hormone receptors  <cit> , and by blocking protein folding pathways  <cit> . 25-hc has been established to yield an antiviral state within huh- <dig> cells by modulating the mevalonate pathway  <cit> . to better understand the nature of the changes induced to the host cell, we performed global transcriptional profiling of huh- <dig> cells and huh- <dig> cells bearing hcv replicons. we identified unique sets of genes that are both up- and downregulated by 25-hc and established the transcriptional changes that lead to the inhibition of hcv replication in huh- <dig> cells. by comparing these transcriptional profiles  with the gene expression profiles of hcv-infected chimpanzees we identified a number of transcripts that may be important for hcv pathogenesis. these genes may also be prognostic markers for disease progression and outcome that are indicative of the antiviral state of the host cell. from the  <dig> overlapping genes, we identified four genes for further study , in an effort to establish a marker for hcv outcome that was linked to the transcriptional state of the host cell.

prox <dig> is a highly conserved transcription factor that is expressed in hepatocytes and is involved in proliferation and migration  <cit> . it is also involved in the control of bile acid synthesis and cholesterol homeostasis in vivo  <cit> . the down-regulation of prox <dig> in replicon cells compared to naïve huh- <dig> cells suggests that prox <dig> may negatively influence hcv replication but that this effect may only occur under certain metabolic conditions. the down-regulation of prox <dig> was observed in the hcv replicon cells treated with 25-hc. contrary to this, prox <dig> expression was observed to rise early post-infection in the sc and tc chimpanzees . the decreased expression of prox <dig> in the chimpanzee with a persistent hcv infection suggests that prox <dig> may be a predictor of the outcome of viremia. dysregulation of prox <dig> was also independently observed in another hcv-infected chimpanzee  <cit> . however, the fold changes observed for prox <dig> may in fact be too small to act as a reliable prognostic marker for clinical applications.

insig- <dig> is highly expressed in the liver and plays an essential role in sterol homeostasis. insig- <dig> inhibits the sterol-dependent retention of the scap/srebp complex in the er and accelerates the sterol-stimulated degradation of hmg-coa reductase, thus regulating the expression of cholesterol, fatty acids, and triglycerides  <cit> . early post-infection, the expression level of insig- <dig> increased in the sc and tc chimpanzees and slightly decreased in the ps chimpanzee , suggesting that this gene acts as an early metabolic predictor of outcome. like 25-hc, insig- <dig> is an hmg-coa reductase inhibitor and, therefore, it would be expected to decrease hcv replication. since we did not observe any change in hcv replication with the insig- <dig> sirna treatment, we can only conclude that the kinetics of sirna knockdown of insig- <dig> were too slow to give rise to significant changes in hmg-coa reductase during the course of the experiment, given that the insig- <dig> sirna sequences had been previously validated  <cit> . interestingly, overexpression of insig- <dig> caused an increase in the levels of hcv proteins ns <dig> and ns5a, which may be the result of a homeostatic response . the fold change values observed for insig <dig> may also limit its ability to serve as a prognostic marker.

nk <dig> was discovered by differential screening of a cdna library derived from human nk cells that were activated by interleukin- <dig>  <cit> . our observation that nk <dig> levels were increased early in viremia in the sc and tc chimpanzees  is consistent with a previous report of increased nk <dig> expression in an hcv-infected chimpanzee  <cit> . nk <dig> was also upregulated in replicon cells treated with 25-hc , suggesting that it may contribute to the suppression of replication caused by 25-hc. taken together, the data suggests that nk <dig> may be a co-factor in inhibiting hcv replication, but it is not sufficient on its own to clear the virus in a persistent infection.

diubiquitin  is an alternative and ubiquitin-independent targeting mechanism for degradation by the proteasome  <cit> . ubd expression is inducible with ifnγ and tnf-α  <cit> , both of which are well known antiviral cytokines. additionally, previous gene expression profiling in hcv-infected chimpanzees identified differential regulation of proteasome genes  <cit> . from the profiling data derived from the hcv replicon cells, ubd was upregulated in 25-hc-treated replicon cells compared with naïve huh- <dig> cells treated with 25-hc. this suggests that upregulation of proteasome degradation of hcv proteins may be an ancillary effect of 25-hc treatment. neither knockdown of ubd using sirna complexes nor overexpression of ubd had an affect on hcv replication in huh- <dig> cells , indicating that ubd is not a target for the development of potential therapeutic strategies for hcv infection. rather, the very large fold change values observed, particularly in the large animal model for infection, suggests that it is a good candidate prognostic marker for an antiviral state within the host cell.

CONCLUSIONS
herein we have established the transcriptional changes that give rise to an antiviral state that inhibits hcv replication within huh- <dig> cells after treatment with 25-hc. we identified four genes that can act as markers for hcv pathogenesis. the functional validation studies showed that none of these genes are likely to be useful as antiviral drug targets, they were identified as being linked to an antiviral state in the hcv replicon cells and in chimpanzee infections. not surprisingly, insig <dig> and prox <dig> transcriptional levels are related to regulation of the mevalonate pathway. the fact that these genes are differentially regulated in different models of hcv pathogenesis further supports their relevance. in the case of prox <dig> and nk <dig>  effects on hcv replication were observed in cell culture but only in certain metabolic states induced by the presence of 25-hc. the overall expression levels of all four genes were the lowest in the persistently infected chimpanzee which suggests that these genes may be predictors of the outcome of infection and might ultimately indicate a particular course of treatment on an individual patient basis. ubd appears to be the most promising since it was observed to have the largest changes in transcriptional levels in the chimpanzee model.
