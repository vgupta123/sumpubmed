BACKGROUND
huntington disease  is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded cag trinucleotide repeat that lengthens a polyglutamine tract near the amino terminus of the huntingtin protein  <cit> . the mutation involves a "gain-of-function" that leads to the selective loss of vulnerable neurons, most notably medium spiny neurons in the caudate nucleus, and results in characteristic progressive writhing movements, in addition to psychological changes and cognitive decline  <cit> . the age at onset of hd is variable, though the motor disturbance typically begins in mid-life, and is followed by an inexorable decline that ends in death after a course of 10â€“ <dig> years. the length of the expanded cag trinucleotide tract is the primary determinant of disease onset, although the mechanism whereby mutant huntingtin triggers the cascade of hd pathogenesis that eventually produces these symptoms is not yet clear  <cit> . like several other polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorders, there is a strong inverse correlation between the length of the polyglutamine tract and the age at neurologic onset, with the longest mutations leading to juvenile hd. indeed, the hd cag repeat length alone accounts for more than half of the overall variance in age at neurologic onset. we and others have showed that the remaining variation in age at neurologic onset of hd is highly heritable and that other genetic factors act to modify the pathogenic process  <cit> . identification and characterization of such modifiers is of critical importance, since their capacity to alter pathogenesis would make them potential targets for development of therapeutics for this currently untreatable disorder.

to date, one candidate genetic modifier of hd has been confirmed in multiple independent studies. an association between genetic variation at grik <dig> , encoding the glur <dig> subunit of the kainate receptor, and age at neurologic onset in hd was first reported by rubinsztein et al., based on  <dig> hd patients from the united kingdom  <cit> . a taa repeat polymorphism  in the 3' untranslated region  of grik <dig> accounted for 13% of the residual variance in onset age after accounting for the effect of the hd cag mutation. the  <dig> repeat allele  was found in those with younger than expected hd onset ages, leading to the suggestion that the taa repeat was a neutral polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with a functional variant in grik <dig>  or in a nearby gene. the grik <dig> association was confirmed in  <dig> unrelated u.s. hd patients, where the relatively rare  <dig> taa allele was associated with an approximate 5-year-younger age at onset  <cit> . subsequently, a modifier role for this locus has been demonstrated in hd populations from france, india, and italy  <cit> . to address the issue of a functional variant at or near the grik <dig> locus, we have tested whether a coding sequence variant explains the modifier effect, and subsequently, we have used analysis of polymorphisms in the grik <dig> region to implicate the taa repeat itself as the source of the genetic modification of onset age.

RESULTS
testing for a functional coding sequence variant in grik2
the grik <dig> taa repeat displays at least  <dig> alleles, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> taa units, though more than 90% of chromosomes have  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> repeats. the largest alleles,  <dig> and  <dig> taas, make up only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of chromosomes in our sample , respectively. our original confirmation of the grik <dig> modifier effect employed  <dig> unrelated affected individuals of known onset available to the massachusetts hd center without walls and did not account for subsequently defined effects of the normal hd cag allele and interaction between the mutant and wild-type cags  <cit> . we have now expanded this test population to  <dig> individuals, genotyped for both the hd cag repeat and the grik <dig> taa repeat. the variability in onset age attributable to the hd cag repeat, wild-type hd cag and interaction of the two  is r <dig> =  <dig> . when the presence of a  <dig> taa repeat allele is added to the model, a statistically significant amount of the variability in onset age is explained: r <dig> =  <dig> , . those genotypes that include a  <dig> allele have a mean age at onset approximately  <dig>  years younger than persons with only other grik <dig> alleles.

on the basis of these data, we selected three individuals who possessed a  <dig> taa allele and displayed much earlier onset of hd than expected based upon their respective cag repeats. gus <dig>  gus <dig> and gus <dig>  had cag repeats of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> units, respectively, which would typically be associated with onset between  <dig> and  <dig> years of age . however, they displayed onset of neurologic symptoms at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> years, respectively. these three individuals contributed strongly to the detection of the modifier effect above, since leaving them out of the analysis dramatically altered the p value for the effect . we also selected one individual, gus <dig> with a rare  <dig> taa allele, a hd cag repeat of  <dig> and an age at onset of  <dig>  for comparison, we also chose four individuals with equivalent cag repeats but a more typical age at neurologic onset. none of these four, gus <dig>  gus <dig>  gus <dig> and gus <dig>  who had cag repeats of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> units and exhibited neurologic onset at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> years, respectively, possessed either a  <dig> or  <dig> grik <dig> taa allele . to identify a functional polymorphism associated with the early onset phenotype, we sequenced the exons and exon boundaries for grik <dig> in all of these individuals.

grik <dig> comprises  <dig> exons spanning ~ <dig> kb in 6q <dig> , with alternative splicing capable of producing alternative carboxyl termini for the protein . sequencing of all exons revealed no coding sequence or boundary changes specific to patients with earlier than expected hd onset. in the eight hd individuals, we identified polymorphisms in the flanking sequences of exons  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and in the coding sequences of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  corresponding to known snps rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  and rs <dig>  respectively . neither of the coding sequence variants is predicted to alter an amino acid. the only other grik <dig> coding sequence snps reported in dbsnp are rs <dig> and rs <dig>  which are predicted to cause v>i and m>i changes in exons  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit>  we did not detect either of these in any of the  <dig> individuals tested.

testing for a common origin of the alleles associated with younger onset
in the absence of a coding sequence variant, we next tested whether the  <dig> taa allele might be in linkage disequilibrium with a functional variant in noncoding sequence or in an adjacent gene. this would predict that the particular chromosomes associated with the early onset phenotype would share a common ancestral origin. consequently, we typed  <dig> microsatellite markers across the grik <dig> locus. these locations are shown in figure  <dig>  with the genotypes for the individuals tested in table  <dig>  markers upstream from grik <dig> and in introns  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> gave no evidence for a common haplotype shared among the individuals with a  <dig> taa allele. indeed, for the markers in introns  <dig> and  <dig>  nearest the 3'utr, at best two of the  <dig> individuals  could have shared a two marker haplotype, '160' at d6s <dig>  and '216' at gata164h <dig>  however, genotyping of the mother and a sibling of gus <dig> revealed that the  <dig> taa allele was in coupling with the alternate gata164h <dig> allele,  <dig> . these data suggest that if the chromosomes bearing a  <dig> taa allele and capable of modifying onset age share a common origin, the shared ancestral region would be 3' to the markers in intron  <dig>  combining these data with the snp genotypes described above suggests further that a segment shared by the  <dig> allele chromosomes would be 3' to the missense snp in exon  <dig>  as gus <dig> and gus <dig> differ at this site on the  <dig> taa allele chromosome.

the  <dig> mb genomic region downstream from grik <dig> shows no known genes in the march  <dig>  assembly of the human genome sequence  <cit> . we tested the nearest polymorphic microsatellites, ~ <dig> mb from the grik <dig> 3'utr. the presence of a  <dig> allele for d6s <dig>  in gus <dig>  gus <dig>  and gus <dig> left open the possibility of a common origin for this ~ <dig> mb segment. to narrow this possibility to grik <dig> itself, we next sequenced the grik <dig> 3'utr region and the 3' portion of intron  <dig> in the same eight individuals, seeking additional polymorphisms that would help to delineate a potential common ancestral origin for the 3' end of the gene. upstream from exon  <dig>  we detected three known snps: rs <dig>  rs <dig>  and rs <dig>  though paschen et al. provided evidence that the taa repeat is present in the 3'utr, the full extent of the latter has not been well characterized and is not completely represented in current genome database annotations  <cit> . consequently, we examined a segment of ~ <dig> kb downstream from the taa termination codon of grik <dig>  we chose this segment based on sequence similarity with grik <dig> orthologues from xenopus, chicken, mouse, rat, dog and chimp  and its presence in mouse and rat grik <dig> mrnas. we found two novel snps, t>c at  <dig> bp and t>c at  <dig> bp 3' to the taa repeat, which have been designated rs <dig> and rs <dig>  respectively .

to simplify haplotype determination across the grik <dig> gene, we segregated the individual chromosome 6s from gus <dig> and gus <dig> in hybrid cell lines. as no lymphoblast cell line was available for gus <dig>  we also relied on genotyping two siblings of this individual in an attempt to limit possible haplotypes. we typed these hybrid lines and gus <dig> relatives for the taa repeat and the two new 3'utr polymorphisms, and we retyped selected polymorphisms reported above to directly confirm local haplotypes.

the haplotypes associated with the three  <dig> taa alleles and one  <dig> taa repeat allele from the individuals with earlier than expected onset of hd are shown in figure  <dig>  phasing of the alleles for the previously analyzed polymorphisms revealed that, on the chromosome associated with younger hd onset, all individuals differ for the haplotype of snps at exons  <dig> and  <dig>  this suggests that any potentially shared region responsible for the modifier effect would lie 3' to exon  <dig>  further, gus <dig> and gus <dig> differ from gus <dig> for the snps in intron  <dig>  suggesting that any ancestrally shared region would lie 3' to rs <dig>   <dig>  kb upstream from the taa repeat. however, gus <dig> differs on the  <dig> taa chromosome from the other individuals at snp rs <dig>  suggesting that any ancestrally shared region would lie 5' to this site,  <dig> bp downstream of the taa repeat. within the segment between snps rs <dig> and rs <dig>  which we sequenced in its entirety, only the taa repeat allele consistently distinguishes these chromosomes from chromosomes not associated with younger than expected onset of hd, suggesting that the length of the taa allele itself is responsible for the modifier effect.

discussion
grik <dig>  encoding the glur <dig> subunit of the kainate receptor, is abundantly expressed in the caudate nucleus, cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum in human. kainate receptors are one of three subtypes of ionotropic receptors for the excitatory amino acid transmitter l-glutamate. they both mediate excitatory synaptic transmission at primary afferent synapses and modulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release  <cit> . interaction of excitatory amino acids with their receptors can potentially cause toxicity that upsets ca++ homeostasis and damages energy metabolism, and such 'excitotoxicity' due to glutamate has long been postulated to be involved in hd pathogenesis  <cit> . however, a recent analysis of systemic 3-nitropropionic acid induced striatal lesions in grik2-/- mice showed no difference in final histopathology or motor impairment compared with similarly treated wild-type mice, suggesting that striatal glur <dig> kainate receptors do not play a critical role in determining neuronal pathology  <cit> . in this experiment, grik2-/- mice did display motor symptoms earlier than wild-type mice, despite the lack of difference in neuropathology, suggesting that the glur <dig> kainate receptors may have played some modulatory role in synaptic transmission rather than mediating excitotoxicity.

there is abundant evidence that genetic modifiers of hd pathogenesis exist, from studies performed before the hd gene was cloned through studies performed more recently with the benefit of molecular definition of the hd mutation  <cit> . grik <dig> is currently the only genetic modifier of hd that has been specifically identified and confirmed in more than two independent studies  <cit> . our findings indicate that 'modifier' chromosomes did not have a functional coding sequence difference that directly alters glur <dig>  rather, they shared the  <dig> taa allele but had different haplotypes for snps within a  <dig>  kb region encompassing the polymorphic repeat, suggesting that the taa allele itself, rather than a linked polymorphism, is responsible for the modifier effect. though the effect may be peculiar to  <dig> taa alleles, we cannot exclude that it is a length-dependent effect encompassing both  <dig> taa and longer alleles, as there are too few  <dig> taa alleles to test for a statistically significant modifier effect. however, the very early onset of gus <dig> suggests that  <dig> taa alleles may also have the potential to modify neurologic onset in hd.

it is likely that the 3' utr taa repeat modifier effect acts at the level of the grik <dig> mrna, with multiple opportunities for allelic alterations in regulation beyond considerations of translational efficiency and stability. indeed, with the exception of the immediate vicinity of the taa repeat, the 3'utr of grik <dig> is remarkably conserved across species, suggesting that it has an important regulatory role . grik <dig> displays alternative splicing of exon  <dig> that leads to two major splice variants encoding proteins with different carboxyl-termini. two other minor alternative splice forms, one skipping exon  <dig>  and one in which a cryptic splice site in exon  <dig> joins to exon  <dig> , have been described. moreover, three major a to i rna editing sites that can affect ion permeability of the receptor due to resulting amino acid substitutions i>v, y>c and q>r, respectively are located in exons  <dig>  and  <dig>  fully unedited receptors at the q/r site exhibit higher relative calcium permeability and higher channel conductance as compared to edited receptors  <cit> . interestingly, two alternative transcripts differing in the length of the 3'utr have been reported, only one of which includes the taa repeat  <cit> . the shorter mrna uses a polyadenylation signal located  <dig> bases after the stop codon, upstream of the taa repeat while the longer mrna extends beyond a putative polyadenylation signal  <dig> bases downstream of the stop codon, 3' to the taa repeat  <cit> . thus, numerous opportunities exist for the taa repeat polymorphism to potentially modify hd onset by virtue of an allelic regulatory effect on the production, polyadenylation status, alternative splicing, subcellular targeting, editing or stability of the grik <dig> mrna. the aforementioned grik2-/- mouse experiments also indicate that an effect on age at neurologic onset may not necessarily be mediated by excitotoxicity, but could occur due to an independent effect on motor function. the fact that grik <dig> is capable of modifying the pathogenic process in hd sufficiently to have a noticeable impact on onset age indicates that it is a potential target for development of an effective therapeutic intervention. however, it will be necessary to delineate of the precise basis for the grik <dig> modifier effect in order to effectively undertake a search for chemical compounds that delay, rather than hasten hd onset.

CONCLUSIONS
grik <dig> acts as a modifier of hd pathogenesis, not through a coding sequence polymorphism that changes the structure of the glur <dig> protein, but rather through a taa repeat polymorphism in the 3'utr. translating this knowledge into a treatment to delay hd pathogenesis will first require definition of the functional consequences of the taa repeat, possibly involving altered regulation of grik <dig> mrna.
