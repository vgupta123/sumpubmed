BACKGROUND
recently, mesenchymal stem cells  were proven to be present in dental tissues, including dental pulp, periodontal ligament and dental follicle. dental stem cells are multipotent mesenchymal stem cells that raised new found enthusiasm among the researchers because of their easy accessibility, high quality and the fact that their usage does not involve the same ethical concerns and controversies as embryonic stem cells do.

dental stem cells are post-natal stem cell populations that have mesenchymal stem cell like qualities, including the capacity for self-renewal and multilineage differentiation potential. these cells are derived from the neural crest, and thus have a different origin from bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, which are derived from mesoderm  <cit> .

the dental follicle , one of the multipotent tissues, is a fibrous ectomesenchymal tissue sac that surrounds the unerupted tooth  <cit>  and regulates the osteoclastogenesis and osteogenesis needed for tooth eruption  <cit> . dental follicle stem cells are the origin of the periodontium, including cementum, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone  <cit>  and this developmental cascade confirms the existence of stem cells in the dental follicle. cells from the dental follicle are able to differentiate toward cementoblasts, fibroblasts and osteoblasts   <cit> . precursor cells isolated from dental follicle express stro- <dig>  oct3/ <dig>  sox- <dig>  nanog, notch <dig> and nestin   <cit>  and are negative for markers of hematopoietic lineage cd <dig> and cd <dig>  and positive for cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd  <dig> and cd <dig>  indicating that those cells are mesenchymal cells  <cit> . dental follicle-derived stem cells have excellent proliferation rates and under specific culture conditions have the capacity to differentiate in multiple lineages cell types such as osteoblasts, cementoblasts, adipocytes and neuron-like cells  <cit> .

most people have an impacted third molar or canine that does not cause occlusion and usually have the impacted tooth extracted either to avoid inflammation or for orthodontic therapy. such extracted teeth usually contain dental follicle and are commonly discarded as medical waste. hence, the dental follicle is a candidate source for isolating stem cells.

studies in the literature have demonstrated the presence of stem cells in the dental follicle of wisdom teeth  <cit> , but there is no research related to the presence of these cell populations in the canine follicular bag included. another issue less studied is the use of follicular stem cells in improving bone regeneration on titanium implants surfaces. current approaches of solving bone defects using alloplastic materials  can involve important limitations, such as weakness of osseointegration in the case of long-term implants, inflammatory response at the implantation sites, biomechanical mismatch. these clinical problems determined further research in this field of implantology, including interventions on implants features in terms of biocompatibility  and also on behavior of cellular components implicated in osteointegration process.

given the above background, we aimed to demonstrate that dental follicle stem cells from impacted molars and canines can be used to improve the bone regeneration process on titanium implants surfaces. the study highlights the presence of stem cells in the dental follicle, their potential to differentiate into bone line cells and to adhere and differentiate into osteoblasts on different types of titanium surfaces.

RESULTS
in this study we present the harvesting technique of the dental follicle from an impacted upper left canine with palatal position. figure 1a illustrates the radiologic appearance of canine  <dig> with intra-osseous impactation from which the follicular sac was harvested. figure 1b shows the clinical appearance of impacted left and right upper canines. after disinfection of the surgical site under local anesthesia, we have performed a palatal incision along the cervical lines from tooth  <dig> to  <dig>  using a scalpel with a no. <dig> blade. we reflected the muco-periostal palatal flap, preserving the nasopalatine nerve. we removed the bone covering the crown of the impacted left canine. immediately after exposure of the impacted left canine, we harvested the follicular sac that was surrounding his crown. dental follicular tissue was harvested using a scalpel with a no. <dig> blade. the crowns of both impacted canines were exposed but no orthodontic brackets for traction of the teeth were placed . the area was then irrigated with saline solution and the flap was closed with interrupted sutures.fig.  <dig>

histological analysis of the harvested tissues
histological analysis of the harvested tissue from impacted third molar and canine reveals the typical aspect of dental follicle with ameloblastic cubic epithelium, malassez epithelium. first image  presents on the top of a vasculo-connective tissue forming the periodontal ligament, a small cluster of epithelial residual cells from hertwig’s epithelial root sheath . these cells are remains from epithelial cells located at cervical loop of the enamel organ in a developing tooth. they initiate the formation of dentin in the root of a tooth by causing the differentiation of odontoblasts from the dental papilla. second image  presents a fragment of detached ameloblastic epithelia part from a scratched dental follicle.fig.  <dig> histological aspect of the canine dental follicle harvested tissue. a. malassez epitelial rest and b. ameloblastic epithelia on periodontal ligament



establishment of cell culture from the dental follicle
after initiation of cell adhesion in first 24 h, cell proliferation was intensive, and after achieving of subconfluence within 3 days, the first passage was made. morphological aspect of the cells was a fibroblast type, spindle-like shape . these cells maintained a high proliferation rate even at advanced passages without modification of morphological aspect . cells culture needed passages at 2– <dig> days.fig.  <dig> morphological aspects of isolated cells from dental follicle in contrast-phase microscopy.  after 24 h rounded shape cells adhere to plastic surface;  migrated cells after 3 days from explants presented a fibroblast-like appearance;  morphologically homogeneous fibroblast-like cell population was observed at 2th passage;  cells maintained their high proliferation rate at passage 7th 



immunophenotypic analysis
immunocytochemical staining performed for isolated cells at third passage has shown strong positivity for specific markers of mesenchymal stem cells such as: ssea- <dig>  oct3/ <dig>  nanog, cd <dig>  d <dig>  and weak positivity for cd <dig> and cd49e. cells did not express cd  <dig> and cd <dig> .fig.  <dig> immunocytochemical staining for characteristic stem cells markers, nuclei were counterstained with dapi.  strong expression for cd  <dig> fitc and weak positivity for cd  <dig> pe;  negative staining for cd  <dig> fitc and cd  <dig> pe;  strong positivity for cd  <dig> fitc, weak expression of cd  <dig> pe;  strong positivity for early embryonic antigen ssea- <dig> fitc;  the self-renewal embryonic proteins oct3/ <dig> fitc strong expression and  nanog fitc positive in some cells 



similar results were obtained by flowcytometry analysis: negative staining for cd <dig> fitc, cd <dig> fitc and cd <dig> pe and positivity for cd <dig> fitc, cd <dig> pe, cd <dig> pe, cd <dig> pe, cd49e pe, cd <dig> pe .fig.  <dig>

rt-pcr analysis for stem cells gene expression
rt-pcr analysis performed in comparison with placental-derived mesenchymal stem cells, confirmed the phenotypic analysis. isolated cells from dental follicle showed strong expression of oct3/ <dig>  cxcr <dig>  scf , cbfβ, thy- <dig> tie- <dig>  vimentin, nanog, and hla-abc. these cells didn’t express htert, sox- <dig>  c-kit and hla-drα .

osteogenic differentiation of dental follicle stem cells in vitro
the advantage of simple osteogenic medium vs. complex osteogenic medium in inducing bone specific proteins
a comparative study was carried to determine the influence of culture medium composition on osteogenic differentiation of df stem cells. the simple osteogenic medium consisting of ascorbic acid, β glicero-phosphate and dexamethazone induced a more stronger expression of non-collagenous proteins osteocalcin , osteonectine , osteopontin  and alkaline phosphatase  as shown by immunocytochemical staining of cells after 3 weeks of cultivation. a certain difference is observed between oc and os medium, the cells cultivated with os medium expressed in a higher extent bone specific non-collagenous proteins op, on and oc . instead, for cells cultivated with oc medium we noticed a more intense staining for alp . cells exhibited a particular patch distribution of bone markers present both in intracellular and extracellular space, related with formation of the novo bone matrix. we also compared the df stem cells cultivated in standard stem cell medium for 3 weeks in terms of osteopontin and alkaline phosphatase expression. a weak expression is observed in these images for alp and negative staining for op as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> fig.  <dig> fluorescence images of immunocytochemical staining of df stem cells induced for osteogenic differentiation using simple osteogenic medium in upper panel:  osteocalcin ,  osteonectine ,  osteopontin  and  alkaline phosphatase . in the lower panel are illustrated the induced expression of same osteogenic markers when df stem cells were cultivated in presence of complex osteogenic medium:  oc fitc,  on-fitc,  op-fitc and  alp-fitc. nuclei were counterstained with dapi 



the complex osteogenic medium, that additionally contains growth factors  has proved less favorable in bone specific proteins expression, but with a more intensive expression of alkaline phosphatase .

cultivation on titan implants
cell adhesion and viability of df stem cells in short term cultures on titanium implants
we investigated the behavior of df stem cells cultivated on surfaces of titanium implants, in order to lay the foundation for finding a new way to induce bone regeneration on the titanium implant surface. the adhesion process was evaluated after  <dig> h of cultivation of df stem cells in standard stem cells medium on three types of titanium implants  using the fluorescein diacetate test . the highest fluorescence values were found for tiha and ti ctrl implants with statistically different values comparing with tisio <dig> implants . the most favorable substrate was proved to be titanium implants infiltrated with ha, especially in the first hour of cell adhesion process. the differences were statistically significant at  <dig> h after seeding the cells. at 48 h and at 7 days of cultivation the ha infiltrated titanium implants preserved the advantages for cell proliferation, but the differences were not statistically significant . microscopical analysis of fda stained df stem cells confirmed the increased number of cells after 48 h and 7 days for df stem cells cultivated on ti ctrl and tiha implants . cell viability and subsequent cell proliferation were evaluated by an additional viability test  in two conditions:  in standard stem cells medium and  in a comparative study between stem medium and differentiation medium os and oc. alamar test revealed as fda test that in the first day of cultivation the ti ha offers slightly increased df stem cells adhesion, but there are no differences between implants after  <dig> and 12 days in terms of viability and proliferation . these findings are strengthened by the results obtained for the cells cultivated with stem cell medium and osteogenic medium for  <dig> and 12 days. the differences appeared between stem cell medium and osteogenic differentiation medium, as inducing the osteogenic differentiation had caused, as expected, a decrease in cell numbers after  <dig> and 12 days of cultivation .fig.  <dig>

the influence of implants surface and culture medium on bmp- <dig> and osteopontin expression during osteogenic differentiation of df stem cells
we evaluate the influence of titanium implants chemistry and topography in combination with differentiation medium on df stem cells osteogenic differentiation. bmp- <dig> is implicated in stem cells differentiation into osteoprogenitor cells. bmp- <dig> de novo secretion was determined by elisa method, in conditioned media at  <dig>   <dig> and 21 days of df stem cells culturing on titanium implants. the tictrl implants induced the highest bmp- <dig> secretion at 14 days in os medium. a very similar behavior was observed for all types of control titanium implants cultivation mediums, by achieving a peak at 14 days and decreased values at 21 days.

for tiha implants the bmp- <dig> values were in a continuous increase for all types of mediums. we observed the maximum values in the samples with tiha in os medium  at 21 days, with values almost  <dig>  times larger compared to the highest levels obtained for tictrl and tisio <dig> samples. for stem cell  and oc medium  bmp- <dig> levels at 21 days were very close to the other measurements from the days  <dig> and  <dig>  we obtained statistical differences only at 21 day between values for os medium and stem cell medium, respectively oc medium .fig.  <dig>

for tisio <dig> the highest bmp- <dig> levels were recorded at 21 days of cultivation in os medium, while in stem cell bmp- <dig> values increased slightly and in the oc medium the bmp- <dig> values decreased at 21 days. differences in inducing bmp- <dig> secretion were observed between os, stem cell and oc mediums at 21 days of cultivation. statistical analysis was carried out using two-way anova bonferroni post test, and revealed statistical significant differences between the mediums for tiha and tictrl implants  .

osteopontin expression evaluated by elisa test, showed a maximum value in first 8 days of cultivation on titanium implants, especially for tictrl and tisio <dig>  the levels of osteopontin progressivelly decreased toward 21 days of cultivation. at 14 days the os medium sustained the highest osteopontin expression on tisio <dig> implants .

the mineralization process is in relationship with surface bioactivity of titanium implants and differentiation cell culture medium
the mineralisation process was assessed by determing the ca2+ levels from the supernatants obtained after 21 days of culturing df stem cells on titanium implants, in stem cell medium, simple and complex osteogenic medium. we also evaluated the ca2+ content at the surface of the titanium implants after 21 days of culture. the results are illustrated in fig.  <dig>  high levels of ca2+ can be observed in the supernatants obtained from cells cultured in the presence of simple and complex osteogenic medium especially on tisio <dig>  supernatants obtained from cells cultured on tictrl implants revealed increased ca2+ values regardless of the type of culturing medium . titanium surfaces coated with hydroxyapatite in the presence of stem cell medium and complex osteogenic medium proved to be the most favorable in terms of ca2+ deposition on the implants’ surface . titanium implants maintained for 21 days in stem cell medium without cells revealed also positivity for alizarin staining, more intensively for implants treated with hydroxyapatite. those implants were kept in the same conditions with implants seeded with cells and had time to adsorb on the surface of implants the existing calcium in basal medium and fbs.fig.  <dig> calcium quantification by the alizarin red method. a ca2+ levels in supernatants harversted after 21 days, from the df stem cell cultures on ti ctrl, ti ha, ti sio <dig> implants using standard stem medium, os and oc mediums  alizarin red staining of ca2+ deposition at the surface of ti ctrl, ti ha, ti sio <dig> implants, in same the conditions of cultivation for 21 days. 



scanning electron microscopy  has brought additional information regarding the changes of implants’ surface and cell behavior for long term cultivation. after 21 days of cultivation on titanium implants, we observed de novo matrix deposition especially on tiha and tictrl implants, in cultures with stem cell medium and os differentiation medium . the smooth surface of tisio <dig> implants has been changed in time by cultivation in the given microenviroment conditions with appearance of grooves that allowed the deposition of the newly formed matrix. for tisio <dig> samples, the most favorable medium seems to be the complex osteogenic medium .fig.  <dig> sem images of titanium implants seeded with df stem cells. left panel -tictrl, tiha, tisio <dig> implants without cells  tictrl with stem cell medium   tictrl with simple osteogenic medium   tictrl with complex osteogenic medium   tiha with stem cell medium   tiha with simple osteogenic medium   tiha with complex osteogenic medium  tisio <dig> with stem cell medium   tisio <dig> with simple osteogenic medium   tisio <dig> with complex osteogenic medium  



increased osteogenic differentiation of df stem cells cultivated on hydroxyapatite coated titanium implants in standard stem cells medium
we hypothesized that osteogenic df stem cell differentiation could be initiated in absence of main soluble osteogenic factors used in standard protocols, such as ascorbic acid, β-glycero-phosphate, dexamethazone, and growth factors. we used in these experiments as osteogenic inductors only the titanium surfaces with or without bioactive coatings. the expression of specific osteogenic markers collagen 1a , osteopontin  and alkaline phosphatase  were determined after 70 days of cultivation of cells on the three types of titanium implants surface. the first finding regarding immunocytochemical staining was the increased number of cells observed on tiha implants surface with a strong expression of alkaline phosphatase as shown in fig.  <dig>  the proliferation rate was lower for tictrl and tisio <dig>  but the cells expressed also strong alp positivity.fig.  <dig>

collagen expression was higher for cells cultivated on titanium implants with bioactive coatings . staining cells for osteopontin revealed that control titanium and tisio <dig> induced the greatest expression of this non-collagenous protein in df stem cells .

discussions
the goal of our research was to prove that dental follicle stem cells are a valuable cell source in improving bone regeneration on titanium implants surfaces. the dental follicle harvesting procedure is easy to undertake since it can be performed in relation to several surgical operations, impacted tooth extraction or even less invasive tooth disclosure. the search for alternative sources of mesenchymal stem cells  is of considerable importance because bone marrow aspiration is an invasive procedure  <cit>  and there are significant age-related decreases in the frequency and differentiation potential of bone-marrow-derived mscs  <cit> . compared to other stem cell sources from the oral cavity, as tooth pulp, the dental follicle is a considerably larger tissue  <cit> , is easily accessible and dental follicle stem cells have a higher proliferation capacity than stem cells from the tooth pulp  <cit> .

one innovative aspect of this study is that the follicular sac can be harvested by orthodontic exposure, thus making the odontectomy of the canines not needed for the harvesting. dental follicular tissue harvesting is easier when removing impacted teeth than in the case of orthodontic exposure of an impacted canine. after removing the impacted molar, the follicular sac can be easily exposed and harvesting can be done using scissors or scalpel with a no. <dig> blade. in case of impacted canine exposure for orthodontic reasons, harvesting of the dental follicle can be done only be scratching of the follicle sac from the crown of the impacted canine. only small fragments of follicle sac can be obtained by orthodontic exposure of impacted canine. a correct diagnosis of complete intrabone impacted canine/molar is a precondition of obtaining uncontaminated dental follicle. partial impacted canine/molar can lead to contamination of the follicular sac, thus compromising the harvesting procedure. this procedure is minimally invasive, and it allows stem cell harvesting during a surgical procedure that was needed anyway. easy harvesting of the follicular sac when coupled with minimal invasive surgery allows for stem cell harvesting during odontectomies/orthodontic exposure, as well as storage in a stem cell bank, as standard procedure  <cit> .

the dental follicle that we obtained from human impacted molars and canines had the same normal histological structure without pathological alterations as shown in fig.  <dig>  we demonstrated that the isolated cells by adherence property to plastic surfaces are stem cells with high proliferation rate, which suggests their remarkable capacity of self-renewal and propagation. reports about the increased proliferation rate and colony-forming capacity of df stem cells by comparison with dental pulp mscs, are considering that df stem cells have more advantages as a stem cells source  <cit> . their ability to differentiate into a wide variety of cell types, together with the possibility of obtaining a high number of cells, make them good candidates for the repair and regeneration of a large variety of tissue  <cit> .

in our research, intense positivity for markers as oct ¾, nanog, ssea- <dig>  cd <dig>  cd  <dig>  cd  <dig> and cd  <dig> negative staining for cd  <dig>  cd  <dig> and cd  <dig>  and low positivity for cd  <dig> and cd49e, along with the high proliferation rate, suggests an intermediate stage between embryonic and adult stem cells of obtained cells from the human dental follicle. the ability of df stem cells to differentiate into neuronal cells positive for neurofilaments as shown in additional file 5: figure s <dig> has demonstrated the plasticity of df stem cells. similar results of high positivity levels  for embryonic stem cells markers ssea- <dig>  oct- <dig>  tra 1- <dig>  tra 1- <dig>  and a lower percentage for cd  <dig> and cd  <dig> were reported and are arguments for df stem cells pluripotency  <cit> . morsczeck et al.  <cit>  and g.t.-j. huang et al.  <cit>  demonstrated the presence of undifferentiated cells using nestin and notch- <dig> as markers. ponnaiyan et al.  <cit>   reviewed the literature and tried to establish a distinct phenotypic fingerprint of each type of dental stem cells, to be more easy to identify and use in regenerative medicine. from this point of view, df stem cells compared with bone-marrow mscs expressed higher amounts of iff- <dig> transcripts and positivity for vimentine. an important observation in our experiments was the expression of oct- <dig>  nanog and rex- <dig>  transcription factors, which are considered to be specific for pluripotent stem cells  <cit> . rex- <dig> is involved in maintaining an undifferentiated state of escs and it is also expressed in bone marrow mscs, but its function in the dental follicle is unclear. as we are talking about a mesenchymal type of stem cells, it was not only expected, but necessary for them to express cd <dig>  and vimentin  <cit> . cd <dig> is an antigen which is present on cd34+ cells from human bone marrow, umbilical cord blood and fetal liver. the significance of cd <dig> expression on mscs as a possible marker for further osteoblastic differentiation is in debate.

using rt-pcr, we could identify the expression of scf and, faintly, of its receptor c-kit. these molecules mostly regulate the proliferation and survival of early hematopoietic cells, but also of germinal cells and melanocytes. the cells don’t seem to express the telomerase transcript , in agreement with their lack of immortality in culture. this can actually be viewed as a good thing, namely an almost nonexistent risk of malignant tumors after transplantation. df stem cells we have examined have a complete lack of hla-dr. this comes not only as a confirmation of their immune privileged status, but as an essential requirement for their definition as mscs  <cit> . the lack of expression of hla-dr offers immunosuppressive properties to these cells whit major impact in clinical transplantation. lack of rejection of df stem cells reduces the incidence of graft- versus host disease as shown by le blanc  <cit> , frank mh  <cit> . these data suggest once more that df stem cells are a valuable source of cells for tissue engineering. on the other hand, the immunomodulatory properties of df stem cells by inhibition of cytokine secretion, t and nk cells proliferation, b cell and dentritic cells maturation and activation, make them a very good cell source for cell based therapy of immune and inflammation-related diseases  <cit> .

a very important factor in elucidating the cellular basis of tissue regeneration is determining the multipotential capabilities of stem cells to differentiate into desire target tissue  <cit> . odontogenic tissues deriving from neural crest such as df stem cells, shows typical features of multipotency and are characterized by a high degree of plasticity, with capacity to differentiate in cells lines derived from all three germ layers  as d’aquino et al. demonstrated  <cit> . an intensively field of investigation have been focused on the role of mscs in bone formation, and on df stem cells in particular  <cit> .

in line with the international research carried out, we demonstrated that dental follicle stem cells have the capacity to induce mineralization in vitro and that new bone formation might be possible using df stem cells. based on existing information, we studied the optimal cell culture conditions and the biocompatibility of several substrates with df stem cells induced to differentiate into osteoblasts. exposure to osteogenic differentiation environment, such as soluble factors  induced osteogenic differentiation of df stem cells in our experiments. simple osteogenic medium without growth factors highly increased the expression of osteoblast main non-collagenous proteins  as shown by immunocytochemical staining. the expression of alp was increased in complex osteogenic differentiation medium containing bmp- <dig> and tgfβ <dig>  although alp is a membrane marker of all types of stem cells, is also a marker of osteogenic differentiation. in early stage of differentiation  an initial peak of alp is observed, followed by a gradual decrease. in this stage, collagen type i is deposited in de novo synthesized extracellular matrix. the final stage of osteogenic differentiation  is characterized by high levels of osteocalcin and osteopontin, and deposition of calcium phosphate  <cit> . cells’ response to growth factors in complex osteogenic medium observed in our experiments, can be explain by the expression of homeobox dlx <dig> transcription factor which regulates osteogenic differentiation via a bmp-2-dependent pathway in df stem cells. the osteogenic differentiation via a bmp- <dig> dependent pathway is activated in presence of bmp- <dig> as well as in presence of dexamethasone and insulin, as shown by viale-bouroncle et al. . bmp- <dig> induces the expression of dlx <dig> and, in turn, dlx <dig> induce bmp- <dig> expression. dlx <dig> maintains cells viability and morphology  and plays an important role in regulation of osteogenic genes and matrix mineralization  <cit> . this study reported that bmp- <dig> induced high activity of alp in df stem cells, but this alp activity was supposed to be directly coordinated by dlx <dig>  after overexpression of dlx <dig> in df stem cells, a late osteogenic transcription factor zbtb  <dig> is up-regulated, by a runx <dig> independent pathway  <cit> . in our study the presence of bmp- <dig> until 28 days in the complex osteogenic medium maintained the cells in an earlier stage of differentiation with a lower level of collagen and non-collagenous proteins and a higher expression of alp. we can suppose that bmp <dig> and dexamethasone induced the notch signaling pathway  via a negative bmp-2/dlx <dig> feed-back loop  <cit> .

due to their high proliferation features and capacity to differentiate into osteoblasts, df stem cells offer a great potential for the future of clinical dentistry  <cit> . lately, the research in the field of bioactive materials aims to develop improved materials with a higher rate of success in the osteointegration process and in inducing bone regeneration. the materials selected for tooth implants should be biocompatible with host tissue, and permit recruitment of endogenous stem cells  <cit> . combining mscs with biomimetic implants  represents an research area that aims to improve surface topography  <cit>  of dental implants, by that improving the osseointegration process. df stem cells were cultured on a β-tricalcium phosphate  scaffolds  <cit> , and the conclusion of these studies was that tcp supports osteogenic differentiation in dental follicle stem cells but also that it induces programmed cell death. recent studies, tested other substrates, biomaterials with certain surface topographical properties  capable to recruit bone marrow mscs and promote their osteogenic differentiation. cell adhesion and proliferation, expression of key osteogenic markers were induced on structured titanium with calcium phosphate coating  <cit> .

similar results were obtained in our study. we used titanium implants as scaffolds for df stem cells. different titanium implant surfaces  were evaluated for biocompatibility with df stem cells, using the fda viability test. the test showed that titanium surfaces treated with ha are more favorable to adhesion and proliferation.

we assessed the influence of titanium surfaces and differentiation medium on df stem cells osteogenic differentiation by bmp- <dig> and osteopontin level evaluation. figure  <dig> shows that df stem cells cultivated on titanium coated with hydroxyapatite with simple osteogenic medium, expressed the highest levels of bmp- <dig> at 21 days after the culture initiation. bmp- <dig> levels are found an increasing trend from day  <dig> to day  <dig> of cultivation in simple osteogenic medium for tiha and tisio <dig> implants. the complex osteogenic medium does not induce high levels of bmp- <dig>  additional bmp- <dig> does not allow stem cells to maturate into osteogenic cells, leaving them in a pre-osteogenic stage. based on that, we can conclude that bmp- <dig> fails to stimulate bone regeneration and osseointegration as also shown by chaudhari a. et al.  <cit> .

osteopontin levels reached a maximum value in the first 8 days of cultivation on titanium implants. the osteopontin levels presented a decreasing pattern of values toward day  <dig>  the high levels of osteopontin detected at 8–14 days of culture, indicate early stages of bone matrix formation. in this early stage of bone formation the secretion of bone proteins builds up a dense network of matrix proteins that helps cells anchor to the titanium surfaces  <cit> . the generated osteopontin will bind strongly to the available crystals and determine the mineralization of the extracellular matrix. alizarin red staining  for ca2+ quantification indicates the highest levels of ca for the implants treated with hydroxyapatite. titanium surfaces that were treated with sio <dig> present high levels of ca2+ in the supernatant and not on the surface of the implants, this can be explained by the release of silicic acid in culture medium  <cit>  leading to intense alizarin red positivity.

the immunocytochemical staining revealed that the highest numbers of cells were to be found on tiha implants with a high expression of alkaline phosphatase and collagen. sem has also correlated the previous finding. the electron microscopy images indicate the presence of cells on the surface of tiha with matrix deposition as shown in fig.  <dig>  in the authors’ opinion, coating titanium implants with hydroxyapatite determines a higher cell adhesion rate than when compared to control titanium surfaces or sio <dig> treated surfaces. our research is in line with the findings of vamze j et al.  who concluded that pure hydroxyapatite stimulates the potential of bone regeneration  <cit> .

long term culturing  of df stem cells in standard medium without soluble osteogenic inducers on ti6al7nb alloy,tiha and tisio <dig> surfaces, induced in all samples the expression of specific osteoblasts markers: alp, osteopontin and collagen. hydroxyapatite coating of titanium implants has been proved more favorable, with the acquisition of a more mature osteoblastic phenotype as shown by immunocytochemical staining . these findings demonstrated that even in absence of exogenous osteogenic factors, tiha implants and in a lesser extent tictrl and tisio <dig> implants can induce and sustain osteogenic differentiation of df stem cells, by their chemical and topographical properties.

the presented research aims to lay the groundwork for further clinical procedures of harvesting and storage of df cells in stem cells banks.

CONCLUSIONS
dental follicle stem cells have been easily obtained from clinically discarded canine or third molar extractions or orthodontic exposure, and can be frozen away for many years. dental follicle stem cells could be a potential cell source for a stem cell bank. in our work we have demonstrated that isolated dental follicle stem cells meet the necessary criteria to be called mesenchymal stem cells and that they have a remarkable osteogenic and mineralization potential, improved by collagen substrate or hydroxyapatite coating of titanium implants. our research demonstrated that dental follicle stem cells are an excellent source of cells for inducing bone regeneration on dental titanium implants.
