BACKGROUND
flowering, which refers to the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase, is one of the most crucial events in the plant life cycle. the precise timing of flowering is controlled by external environmental cues and endogenous developmental signals. correct timing is fundamental to successful reproduction and has dramatic significance for crop yields  <cit> . five genetic pathways relevant to flowering have been identified in the model species arabidopsis thaliana, namely, photoperiod, vernalization, gibberellic acid, autonomous and aging pathways  <cit> . photoperiod and vernalization pathways regulate flowering time by perceiving environmental changes, such as alterations in day length in the case of the former and prolonged low temperature in the latter. in contrast, gibberellic acid, autonomous and aging pathways responses to flowering are internally controlled  <cit> . nevertheless, increasing evidence is revealing that the genetically defined pathways that regulate flowering time are connected. for example, these pathways are integrated by a series of downstream flowering integrator genes, including flowering locus t  and suppressor of constans  <dig> , whose outputs are subsequently conveyed to floral meristem identity genes, such as apetala  <dig>  and leafy , that trigger flowering  <cit> .

flowering integrators are regulated in two completely opposite ways by two central upstream genes: constans  and flowering locus c   <cit> . one of the integrators, ft, is controlled by both co and flc  <cit> . co, a core component of the photoperiod pathway, encodes a zinc finger protein, acts as a floral activator and is mediated by the circadian clock  <cit> . flc, in contrast, encodes a mads-box transcription factor that acts as a repressor of flowering  <cit> . at present, many pathways have been reported to regulate flc via different chromatin pathways and co-transcriptional mechanisms involving cold-induced long antisense intragenic rna  transcripts  <cit> . one of these pathways is the autonomous pathway in which alternative processing of coolair transcripts leads to gene body histone k <dig> demethylation and flc down-regulation  <cit> . in another such pathway, the vernalization pathway, prolonged cold elevates coolair transcription and silences flc in a polycomb-mediated epigenetic process  <cit> .

vernalization is the process promoting flowering in plants after prolonged low temperature treatment   <cit> . in arabidopsis, the molecular mechanism of vernalization has been studied by identifying the functions of a set of vrn genes. vrn <dig> encodes a plant-specific protein that binds dna in a non–sequence-specific manner in vitro  <cit> . the vrn <dig> protein sequence possesses two b <dig> dna-binding domains that were first discovered in the maize protein viviparous <dig>   <cit>  as well as two putative pest protein-turnover domains  <cit>  and a nuclear localization signal sequence  <cit> . although over-expression of vrn <dig> causes early flowering in arabidopsis, vrn <dig> mutants of arabidopsis do not delay flowering time—they merely reduce vernalization response  <cit> . briefly, vrn <dig> regulates flowering time by stably repressing the floral repressor flc  <cit> . vrn <dig> is also involved in other processes essential for arabidopsis development  <cit> . other vrn genes participating in regulation of flowering time through the vernalization pathway have also been identified. vernalization  <dig> , which encodes a nuclear-localized zinc finger, is a homolog of the drosophila polycomb protein su <dig>  both vrn <dig> and vrn <dig> maintain the repression of flc epigenetically  <cit> . vernalization  <dig> , encoding a plant homeodomain finger protein, is only expressed during vernalization and represses flc  <cit> . compared with vrn <dig> and vrn <dig>  which maintain flc silencing, vin <dig> is essential for establishing flc repression during vernalization  <cit> . vernalization  <dig> , a vin3-related protein, is constitutively expressed  <cit> .

soybean , a typically photoperiod-sensitive plant, is classified as a short-day species. because of this photoperiod sensitivity, soybean cultivation has long been limited to a very narrow latitudinal range. the recent availability of the soybean draft genome sequence has accelerated the study of soybean flowering. comparative genomic analysis of soybean and arabidopsis flowering genes has revealed similar flowering pathways in these two species  <cit> . interestingly, vernalization pathway genes are also found in soybean, which does not need to undergo a prolonged low temperature treatment before flowering  <cit> . in our preliminary research, arabidopsis dreb1a driven by the 35s promoter was introduced into soybean, yielding transgenic plants that displayed delayed flowering  <cit> . an expression analysis of flowering time showed that the vernalization pathway gene, glyma11g <dig> was strongly up-regulated in the transgenic plants . we thus speculate that this gene may play important roles in the regulation of flowering time. in the study reported here, the functions of glyma11g <dig>  a homolog of arabidopsis vrn <dig>  were investigated for the first time. we found that glyma11g <dig> was responsive to photoperiod and low temperature in soybean and that heterologous expression of glyma11g <dig> in arabidopsis columbia- <dig>  caused early flowering. in transgenic arabidopsis, the expressions of fd and flower repressor flc obviously decreased and the expressions of vin <dig> and floral integrator ft increased significantly. these results imply that glyma11g <dig> is a functional protein similar to vrn <dig> in arabidopsis and may play a pivotal role in regulating flowering time through the vernalization pathway.

RESULTS
isolation and sequence analysis of glyma11g13220
as inferred from previous results in our laboratory involving atdreb1a-overexpressing soybean plants exhibiting delaying flowering  <cit> , glyma11g <dig>  may play important roles in flowering time regulation . sequence information for the flowering-induced gene glyma11g <dig>  was obtained from the phytozome v. <dig>  database  <cit> . although vrn <dig> was not the arabidopsis b <dig> protein having the highest similarity to glyma11g <dig> , glyma11g <dig>  was predict to be a homolog of arabidopsis vrn <dig> in accordance with previous comparative genomic analyses of soybean flowering genes  <cit> . to further characterize the function of glyma11g <dig> in regulation of flowering time, we isolated the gene from the soybean cultivar huachun <dig>  the glyma11g <dig> sequence was  <dig>  bp long and contained a 175-bp 5′ untranslated region , a 383-bp 3′ utr and a  <dig> -bp open reading frame. blast analysis indicated that this sequence was consistent with the william  <dig> soybean reference sequence. glyma11g <dig> was predicted to encode a protein of  <dig> amino acids. two putative b <dig> dna domains were also separately identified at amino acid residues 40– <dig> and 334– <dig> . phylogenetic analysis revealed that related homologs of glyma11g <dig> were mainly found in monocots and especially in leguminous plants, but not in lower plants, animals or microbes. this distribution pattern indicates that this type of gene is specific to higher plants . even though glyma11g <dig> shared only weak amino acid sequence identity with vrn <dig> in arabidopsis , both of these genes had two conserved b <dig> dna domains . the presence of these shared domains suggests that the function of glyma11g <dig> may be similar to that of arabidopsis vrn <dig> fig.  <dig> diagram of glyma11g <dig> and arabidopsis vrn <dig> domain organization. the two b <dig> domains of glyma11g <dig> are located between amino acids 40– <dig> and 334– <dig>  while those of arabidopsis vrn <dig> are positioned between amino acids 5– <dig> and 244–332

sequence analysis of the glyma11g <dig> promoter
in an attempt to elucidate the possible factors associated with the regulation of glyma11g <dig> expression, we analyzed the promoter region using the plantcare database  <cit>  and found several putative cis-elements. all of the identified cis-elements are listed in table  <dig>  the elements in this region included light-responsive elements , abiotic stress-responsive elements , and plant hormone-related flowering elements . the presence of many different potential cis-elements in the upstream region of glyma11g <dig> suggests that the gene is regulated by multiple external environmental and internal hormonal cues and especially by light conditions.table  <dig> putative cis-elements in the glyma11g <dig> promoter




transcript profiling of glyma11g <dig> in soybean
to study the underlying role of glyma11g <dig> in flowering during the soybean development process, we used quantitative real-time pcr  to analyze its transcription levels in multiple organs, including leaves, stems, roots, shoot apexes, flowers and pods, at different vegetative and reproductive growth stages under short-day conditions . glyma11g <dig> expression was readily detected in all organs at all monitored developmental stages. glyma11g <dig> transcript levels were higher in leaves and pods than in other analyzed organs. glyma11g <dig> expression levels gradually increased in leaves during the development period, reaching their maximum before flowering. in contrast, expression was very low in shoot apexes and stems. this observed pattern suggests that glyma11g <dig> plays a role prior to flowering.fig.  <dig> transcript profiling of glyma11g <dig> in soybean based on quantitative real-time pcr analysis of glyma11g <dig> in different organs at different developmental stages under short-day conditions. u, untrifoliate period; t <dig>  first trifoliate period; t <dig>  second trifoliate period; t <dig>  third trifoliate period; t <dig>  fourth trifoliate period; shoot apex ; f, flower; p, pod 14 days after flowering. expression levels are normalized to gmβ-tubulin . values are means ± sd of three biological replicates, with each measurement repeated three times



expression patterns of glyma11g <dig> in response to different light conditions
because we found many light-responsive cis-elements in the glyma11g <dig> promoter , we investigated whether glyma11g <dig> is photoperiod responsive. to examine the photoperiod sensitivity of this gene, we observed the phenotype of huachun <dig> and analyzed the time course-dependent expression patterns of glyma11g <dig> in soybean under both short- and long-day conditions. as can be seen in fig. 4a and additional file  <dig>  huachun <dig> plants flowered significantly earlier under short-day conditions than under long-day ones. approximately 53 days after emergence , soybean plants grown under short-day conditions were in the full of pods period, whereas plants under long-day conditions were still in the initial flowering period. this phenotypic difference demonstrates that huachun <dig> is sensitive to photoperiod. with respect to glyma11g <dig> expression over time, transcript levels remained unchanged during the initial period under short-day conditions; they subsequently increased sharply to a maximum at  <dig> dae and then decreased. under long-day conditions, in contrast, glyma11g <dig> expression was gradually up-regulated, showing a peak at  <dig> dae with reduced expression thereafter. at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dae, glyma11g <dig> expression existed significantly different between under short- and long-day conditions. this result implies that glyma11g <dig> is photoperiod responsive in soybean.fig.  <dig> expression patterns of glyma11g <dig> under different light conditions. all seedlings were grown under short-day conditions until 10 days after emergence , at which point half of the seedlings were transferred to long-day conditions. fully expanded trifoliate leaves were sampled from three individual plants growing under short- and long-day conditions 12 h after dawn at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dae. a image obtained approximately  <dig> dae . b quantitative real-time pcr analysis of glyma11g <dig> under short- and long-day conditions at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dae. expression levels are normalized to gmβ-tubulin . values are means ± sd of three biological replicates, with each measurement repeated three times. significant differences based on the t-test are denoted by asterisks: * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> 



subcellular localization of glyma11g <dig> protein
to understand the potential function of glyma11g <dig>  we examined the subcellular localization of glyma11g <dig> in rice protoplasts. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the enhanced green fluorescent protein  fluorescence signal of glyma11g <dig> clearly overlapped with the mcherry fluorescence signal, whereas no obvious fluorescence signal was detected in the cytoplasm. conversely, the egfp fluorescence signal of the empty control was distributed throughout the whole cell. the results of this experiment indicate that glyma11g <dig> is mainly a nuclear-localized protein.fig.  <dig> subcellular localization of glyma11g13220-gfp fusion protein. constructs 35s::glyma11g13220-egfp and 35s::egfp were separately co-transformed into rice protoplast cells with 35s::arf19iv-mcherry. the cells were observed under a confocal laser microscope. arf19iv-mcherry was used as a nuclear marker protein. scale bars, 10 μm



early flowering in arabidopsis caused by ectopic expression of glyma11g13220
we over-expressed glyma11g <dig> in arabidopsis  to evaluate the function of this gene in regulation of flowering time. three transgenic t <dig> lines with the most obvious flowering time phenotypes were chosen to assess the expressions of genes involved in flowering pathways. notably, over-expression of glyma11g <dig> resulted in obvious early flowering. the flowering times of transgenic arabidopsis lines l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> were respectively about  <dig>   <dig> and 3 days earlier than the wild type   and correlated with glyma11g <dig> expression levels . over-expression of glyma11g <dig> also led to remarkable changes in rosette leaf numbers of l <dig> and l <dig> . to further confirm the possible pathway by which glyma11g <dig> stimulated flowering, we evaluated the expressions of several genes involved in different flowering pathways. qrt-pcr analysis indicated that transcript levels of flc and fd in transgenic arabidopsis decreased significantly compared with the wild type , whereas vin <dig>  ft and ap <dig> noticeably increased . to summarize, the early flowering of transgenic arabidopsis may have been due to the decreased expression of the floral repressor flc.fig.  <dig> heterologous expression of glyma11g <dig> in arabidopsis. a phenotypic comparison between transgenic and wild-type  plants. one-month-old plants were photographed. b quantitative real-time pcr analysis of glyma11g <dig> in transgenic plants. nd, not detected. values are means ± sd of three biological replicates, with each measurement repeated three times. c rosette leaf numbers of transgenic and wild-type  plants during flowering. values are means ± sd; t-test: * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> . at least six plants were counted for each line. d days until initial flowering of transgenic and wild-type  plants. values are means ± sd; t-test: * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> . at least six plants were counted for each line

effects of low temperature treatment on glyma11g <dig> expression
to investigate whether glyma11g <dig> is affected by low temperature, soybean plants were exposed to a low temperature treatment  for 10 days and then returned to normal temperature conditions. compared with the flowering time of untreated plants, that of low-temperature-treated plants was delayed by approximately 8 days . after  <dig>   <dig> or 6 days of treatment, glyma11g <dig> expression in treated plants was up-regulated relative to untreated ones. by day  <dig> of treatment, glyma11g <dig> expression was highly significantly different between treated and untreated plants. after treatment for  <dig> or 10 days, glyma11g <dig> expression was decreased in treated plants compared with the untreated controls . these results imply that glyma11g <dig> can respond to low temperature and may play a role in low-temperature-induced delay of flowering of soybean.fig.  <dig> effects of low temperature treatment on glyma11g <dig> expression. a soybean plants during initial flowering. nt, no treatment; ltt, low temperature treatment. b quantitative real-time pcr analysis of glyma11g <dig> under no- and low temperature treatments at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 10 days after treatment. values are means ± sd of three biological replicates, with each measurement repeated three times. significant differences according to the t-test are denoted as follows: * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> 



discussion
research on the regulation of flowering time has been carried out for more than a century  <cit> . because it is sensitive to photoperiod, soybean is considered to be a typical photoperiodic model plant. many researchers have consequently focused on soybean photoperiod pathway genes, which give rise to the identification of the functions of photoperiod pathway genes such as gmfts and gmcos . comparative genomic analysis of soybean flowering genes following the release of the draft cultivated soybean sequence has revealed that the soybean genome contains flowering regulation pathways similar to those of arabidopsis  <cit> . interestingly, the soybean genome has retained vernalization pathway genes over the course of evolution, even though flowering in soybean does not require prolonged exposure to low temperature  <cit> . little is known, however, about the functions of these vernalization pathway genes in soybean and whether the pathway is redundant. in this study, we investigated the functions of glyma11g <dig>  a homolog of arabidopsis vrn <dig>  our generated data provide the first evidence to show that glyma11g <dig> is a functional protein that may regulate flowering time through the vernalization pathway in arabidopsis. our results also suggest that the preservation of vernalization pathway genes in soybean is meaningful and that glyma11g <dig> may play an important role in low-temperature-induced delay of flowering of soybean. in addition, we found that the function of arabidopsis vrn <dig> and glyma11g <dig> is both conserved and divergent.

vernalization is the process in which plants are induced to flower after exposure to prolonged low temperature  <cit> . recent studies have explored vernalization response at the molecular level in three plant families: poaceae, brassicaceae and amaranthaceae  <cit> . although designated by the same names, the genes related to vernalization response differ greatly in function among different plant families  <cit> . for example, wheat and barley vrn <dig> genes encode mads-box transcription factors  <cit> , whereas the arabidopsis vrn <dig> gene contains two b <dig> dna domains promoting flowering and is predicted to be involved in epigenetic repression of flc  <cit> . previous studies have revealed the conserved nature of flowering pathways between soybean and arabidopsis  <cit> . in our research on soybean, we also found that the vernalization pathway is apparently conserved between arabidopsis and soybean. in arabidopsis, vrn <dig> encodes two b <dig> dna domains and localizes in the nucleus  <cit> . overexpression of vrn <dig> causes early flowering and stably represses flc, the major vernalization pathway gene target, in arabidopsis  <cit> . glyma11g <dig> also encodes two b <dig> dna domains and is nuclear-localized according to our study . over-expression of glyma11g <dig> was found to result in early flowering in arabidopsis  . furthermore, heterologous expression of glyma11g <dig> caused down-regulation of flc, a floral repressor, and significant up-regulation of ft in transgenic arabidopsis . these altered expressions should be responsible for the early flowering phenotype of transgenic arabidopsis.

functional divergence exists between arabidopsis vrn <dig> and glyma11g <dig>  vrn <dig> is constitutively expressed in arabidopsis  <cit> , while glyma11g <dig> is mainly expressed in soybean leaves and pods . apart from this distinction, we found many light-responsive cis-elements in the glyma11g <dig> promoter , and our time course-dependent experiment demonstrated that glyma11g <dig> can respond to photoperiod . over-expression of vrn <dig> affected other phenotypes as well. vrn <dig> over-expression down-regulated flc, but only slightly, compared with the effect of glyma11g <dig> over-expression in arabidopsis. in addition, fd was down-regulated and ap <dig> noticeably up-regulated in transgenic arabidopsis . fd, a bzip transcription factor, is highly expressed at the shoot apex, and its levels decrease soon after the floral primordium begins to express ap <dig>  this transcription factor can also interact with ft protein at the shoot apex. a complex of ft and fd proteins activates floral identity genes such as ap <dig>  <cit> . ap <dig> up-regulation, which marks a commitment to flower formation  <cit> , was ultimately responsible for earlier flowering of transgenic plants compared with the wild type . interestingly, vin <dig> expression was found to be significantly induced in transgenic arabidopsis . previous studies have shown that vin <dig> is expressed only in arabidopsis during vernalizing cold and contributes to the establishment of flc repression during vernalization  <cit> . in other words, vin <dig> expression is a marker of vernalization, with flc repression not occurring until vin <dig> is induced  <cit> . in our transgenic lines, however, vin <dig> was significantly up-regulated without vernalization, implying that glyma11g <dig> may be associated with low temperatures. our subsequent experiment revealed that glyma11g <dig> can respond to low temperature . consequently, we speculate that glyma11g <dig> is photoperiod responsive at normal temperatures in soybean. glyma11g <dig> may play a pivotal role in the regulation of flowering time when low temperatures are suddenly encountered, thereby ensuring reproductive success.

CONCLUSIONS
the functional protein glyma11g <dig> may regulate flowering time through the vernalization pathway in arabidopsis and can respond to photoperiod and low temperature in soybean. although soybean does not need to be vernalized for flowering, the vernalization pathway gene of soybean is functional. finally, glyma11g <dig> and arabidopsis vrn <dig> have conserved as well as divergent functions.
