BACKGROUND
cd <dig> is a 55 kda glycoprotein expressed mainly on the surface of monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes  <cit> , which plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide   <cit> . currently, lps-induced cellular activation is thought to occur through signal complexes comprised of cd <dig> and either myeloid differentiation factor - <dig> or toll-like receptor   <dig>  <cit> . lps binding to these complexes facilitates activation of the tlr4/nuclear factor -κb inflammatory pathway, ultimately leading to the production of proatherogenic cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha , interleukin- <dig> , and il- <dig>  <cit> .

strategies aimed at inhibiting the expression of tlr <dig> complex genes have been used to analyze their contribution to inflammatory reactions  <cit> . in addition to inhibiting tlr <dig> expression, many cd14-deficient mice have also been established by cd <dig> knockout strategies  <cit> . when infected by live gram-negative bacteria or lps, cd14-deficient mice demonstrate reduced bacteremia and systemic inflammation  <cit> . thus, inhibiting signals through cd <dig> may limit the release of a broad range of inflammatory mediators, and prevent rapid bacterial dissemination following infection by gram-negative bacteria  <cit> .

numerous approaches using monoclonal antibodies, small molecule antagonists, and rna interference have demonstrated that inhibiting lps signals through lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, cd <dig>  md- <dig>  and tlr <dig> reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . for instance, small interfering  rna targeting cd <dig> in the mouse cell line raw <dig>  was found to inhibit the release of tnf-α, macrophage inflammatory protein- <dig>  il- <dig>  and the production of nitric oxide following exposure to lps  <cit> . thus far, most of our understanding about the role of cd <dig> during gram-negative bacterial inflammation comes from studies of mouse knockout models or mouse and human immune cells. however, because of the serious harm caused by bacterial infections such as mastitis and brucella in large livestock animals and huge resultant losses to the breeding industry, it is essential to establish knockout models of such animals to investigate the cd <dig> role in lps-induced inflammation. this would also be of benefit in the development of a practical and effective measure to prevent bacterial infection in livestock. based on our previous discovery of the effect of cd <dig> down-regulation in buffalo monocytes/macrophages  <cit> , the present study aimed to establish a transgenic mouse model to express bovine cd <dig> short hairpin  rna, and to determine the effect of endogenous mouse cd <dig> down-regulation on gene expression of the mouse tlr <dig> signaling pathway.

RESULTS
screening of shrna sequences targeting bovine cd14
given the importance of cd <dig> in lps signaling, we first sought to screen shrna sequences for their ability to inhibit bovine cd <dig> expression in vitro. using abi sirna online software , three different sites of the bovine cd <dig> mrna sequence  were used to design three cd <dig> shrna sequences . cd <dig> shrna lentiviral expression vectors with human u <dig> promoters were constructed , and lentiviral particles were produced using the calcium-phosphate method, with titers reaching 1 ×  <dig> . lentiviral particles expressing bovine cd <dig> shrna were used to infect hek  <dig> cells expressing cd <dig> at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig>  using a non-infected cell line as blank control, the scrambled shrna as negative control. the infected cells were harvested 72 h after infection and total rna was extracted for quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction  analyses. as expected, cells infected with the shrna-negative control showed no reduction in cd <dig> expression . compared with scrambled shrna- <dig>  shrna- <dig> and shrna- <dig> fragments were also unable to reduce bovine cd <dig> expression. however, the shrna- <dig> fragment significantly inhibited cd <dig> mrna expression in vitro  . shrna- <dig> nucleotides were highly conserved between cows, sheep, buffalos, and humans, indicating that this shrna fragment could potentially be used in related research of multiple species.figure  <dig>

shrna and construction of its eukaryotic expression vector. a. effect of designed bovine cd <dig> shrnas was detected by qrt-pcr analysis. the lentiviral particles expressing cd <dig> shrnas were used to infect hek  <dig> cells expressing bovine cd <dig>  non-infected cell line as a blank control, the scrambled shrna as negative control. the values for columns with different letters represent statistically significant differences, p <  <dig> . b. the inhibition effect of cd <dig> shrna- <dig> fragment was confirmed by western blot analysis. hek  <dig> cells stably expressing bovine cd <dig> were infected by shrna- <dig> lentivirus at two different mois , the negative control was hek  <dig> cells stably expressing bovine cd <dig> . c. identification of the psilencer™ <dig> -cd14-ires recombinant plasmid. m: 1 kb marker; lane1: psilencer™ <dig> -cd14shrna-ires plasmid: lane2: psilencer™ <dig> -cd14shrna-ires plasmid digested by sspi enzyme; lane3: psilencer™ <dig> -cd14shrna-ires plasmid digested by hpai and bamhi enzyme. d. map of psilencer™ <dig> -cd <dig> shrna-ires vector. e. confirmation of f <dig> generation transgenic mice by southern blot analysis. three f <dig> mice were selected, among them, two  were transgenic while the third was not  by rt-pcr analysis. the positive control was psilencer™ <dig> -cd <dig> shrna-674-ires plasmid. m: marker; lane 1: positive control; lane 2: offspring of 22# mouse; lane 3: offspring of 11# mouse; lane 4: offspring of 32# mouse.



to confirm if the shrna- <dig> fragment also reduced expression of the cd <dig> protein, we performed western blot analysis. at two different mois, the intracellular expression of shrna- <dig> completely abolished cd <dig> protein expression , which was consistent with rt-pcr analysis.

shrna transgenic mice demonstrated reduced cd <dig> expression
we next determined the effects of the shrna- <dig> fragment on cd <dig> expression in vivo. to avoid the biological safety problems of lentiviruses, the shrna- <dig> fragment was inserted into the eukaryotic shrna expression vector psilencer™ <dig> -cmv neo. internal ribosome entry site  elements were then ligated with the vector to construct the psilencer <dig> -cd <dig> shrna-674-ires plasmid . this plasmid was linearized with nhe i digestion and microinjected into the pronucleus of fertilized eggs from fvb mice to create cd <dig> shrna transgenic mice. after transferring two-cell stage embryos into pseudo-pregnant females, a total of  <dig> founder pups were obtained. transgene integration in f <dig> offspring was analyzed by amplifying egfp and neo genes that were both amplified in three founder mice : one male  and two females  that were regarded as transgenic. within the f <dig> generation ,  <dig> mice were born, of which  <dig> were found to be transgenic . in the  <dig> transgenic f <dig> mice,  <dig> was offspring of 11# f <dig> mouse,  <dig> and  <dig> were offspring of 22# and 32# mouse respectively. three of the 33 f <dig> mice were selected for southern blot analysis to confirm the pcr data. two  were transgenic while the third was not  . these findings were consistent with pcr results .

to further characterize the transgene insertion, organs of f <dig> transgenic mice  were analyzed for egfp expression by confocal microscopy. this protein was shown to be expressed in the liver, kidney, and spleen tissue of all transgenic mice, with the highest expression detected in the spleen. however, egfp expression was absent from heart and lung tissues. the expression pattern was similar in both male and female mice . together these data demonstrated that the transgenic mice were chimeric.figure  <dig>

to explore if the transferred shrna fragment affected the expression of endogenous cd <dig> mrna in vivo, we used qrt-pcr to analyze the relative expression of cd <dig> expression in tissues of f <dig> transgenic mice . compared with non-transgenic mouse rna samples, the expression of endogenous cd <dig> mrna in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney tissues of transgenic mice was reduced 8-, 3-,  <dig> -, 6-, and  <dig> fold, respectively . thus, the expression of endogenous cd <dig> mrna was inhibited in transgenic mice.figure  <dig>

we next examined the expression pattern of genes in the tlr <dig> signaling pathway. tlr <dig> demonstrated a significantly increased expression level in the heart and liver of cd <dig> shrna transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice , although there were no significant differences in expression in the spleen, lung, or kidney between transgenic and wild-type mice. md- <dig>  tnf-α, and il- <dig> transcripts showed similar expression patterns, except for the kidney, with significantly increased expression in the heart, liver, and lung , and significantly lower expression in the spleen  compared with wild-type mice. exogenous neo expression showed the same pattern as that of md- <dig> and il- <dig>  but with greater differences between transgenic and wild-type mice. together, these results revealed the successful generation of a mouse model expressing bovine cd <dig> shrna, and indicated that the inhibition of exogenous cd <dig> expression altered the expression levels of genes in the tlr <dig> signaling pathway in vivo.

discussion
several studies have previously demonstrated that cd <dig> plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response to lps  <cit> . in the cd14-dependent signaling pathway, cd <dig> binds to lps and facilitates activation of the tlr4/nf-κb inflammatory pathway  <cit> . upstream inhibition of the bacterial lps/tlr4/cd14-mediated inflammation pathway has been proven to be an effective therapeutic approach for attenuating dysfunctional immune activation  <cit> . however, very few studies have investigated the role of cd <dig> in lps-induced inflammation in large livestock animals such as sheep, cows, and buffalos. nevertheless, this is of particular importance because of the multiple reproductive and veterinary problems associated with these species, and the need to develop a practical and effective measure to prevent bacterial infections in livestock.

we previously found that knockdown of endogenous cd <dig> had clear regulatory effects on the signal transduction of tlr <dig> after stimulation with lps in buffalo monocyte/macrophages in vitro  <cit> . to determine if cd <dig> knockdown had similar effects in large livestock animals in vivo, it is first necessary to establish a mouse model expressing bovine cd <dig> shrna. this model would provide basic data about cd <dig> knockdown on animal development, gene expression in the cd14-dependent signaling pathway, and most importantly on toxicity experiments. future work could then build on these data and establish a larger animal model with the aim of developing novel therapeutic interventions to inflammatory diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
we successfully generated a mouse model expressing bovine cd <dig> shrna by pronuclear microinjection. moreover, we showed that the inhibited expression of exogenous cd <dig> shrna altered the expression levels of some genes in the tlr <dig> signaling pathway in transgenic mice.
