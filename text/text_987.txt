BACKGROUND
the precision and correctness of intron removal during pre-mrna splicing rely on the recognition of several discrete elements some of which, as the splicing donor and acceptor sites, are mostly invariant. however, many other loosely defined cis-acting elements such as the polypyrimidine tract, the branch site and several other sequences, both exonic and intronic, may contribute to exon recognition. recently, several reports have shown that exonic sequences are able to regulate splicing proficiency, and that nucleotide substitutions in these sequences, lead or may lead to abnormal splicing or exon skipping  <cit> . moreover, it has been demonstrated that aberrant splicing can occur as a consequence of mutations that disrupt exonic splicing enhancers  or create exonic splicing suppressors  . exonic splicing enhancers have been identified on the basis of exon mutations that block splicing, of computational comparison of exon sequences, and of the selection of sequences that activate splicing or that bind to specific regulatory proteins, most notably the sr  proteins. three web-based resources, esefinder  <cit> , rescue-ese  <cit> , and pesx  <cit>  have recently been developed to identify putative eses responsive to the human sr proteins and to predict whether exonic mutations disrupt such elements. these algorithms have identified eses that tend to colocalize with natural enhancers, and more frequently in exonic sequences rather than in introns. in a recent review, more than  <dig> nucleotide substitutions, that had previously been reported to cause exon skipping in vivo, were found to reduce or abolish at least one of these computer-identified eses  <cit> . therefore, a significant number of disease-associated point mutations or polymorphisms may lead to aberrant splicing. however, enhancer and silencer elements can be juxtaposed in specific exonic regions. thus, efficient splicing is the result of a plethora of quite complex interactions mediated by different splicing factors, each binding to its proper target sequence. we have recently investigated several mutations altering splicing in the mlh <dig> gene whose mutations are responsible for hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer   <cit> . patients with hnpcc usually have a family history of early onset of synchronous and metachronous colorectal cancers and an elevated risk of several other extracolonic malignancies, mainly of the endometrium, stomach, hepato-biliary tract and ovary. the disease is caused by germline mutations of genes within the dna mismatch repair  pathway. nearly 90% of families with an identified genetic defect harbor mutations in either mlh <dig>  or msh <dig> ,  <cit> . the insight database  <cit> , accessed in march  <dig>  lists a total of  <dig> different mlh <dig> and msh <dig> mutations. while the majority of these are either nonsense or frameshifting alterations with an obvious pathogenic influence on the resultant protein, 26% of the alterations listed in the database are missense mutations and therefore their consequences on biological functions are assumed to rely on the principle that the single change introduced in the amino acid sequence impairs the biological function or the structure of the encoded protein. a recent work  <cit>  has demonstrated that pathogenic missense mutations in the hmlh <dig> and hmsh <dig> genes, in contrast to polymorphic variants, tend to colocalize in ese sequences.

on the basis of all the above evidence, we decided to evaluate the  <dig> hmlh1/hmsh <dig> missense mutations listed in the insight database with the currently available ese prediction programs. we next investigated the consequences of  <dig> exonic missense mutations with different predicted effects on putative enhancer and suppressor sequences. we found that the splicing behaviour of these mutations cannot be evaluated only on the basis of their predicted localization in ese sequences.

to further extend our analysis, we assessed the effects of the  <dig> missense mutations in three different mammalian cell lines. we observed that some nucleotide changes affect splicing with a different degree of severity in different cellular backgrounds.

RESULTS
esefinder, rescueese and pesx identify non overlapping ese motifs
a recent survey of all the missense mutations and neutral polymorphisms reported in the insight mutation database for the hmlh <dig> and hmsh <dig> genes  <cit>  indicates that missense mutations, but not neutral polymorphisms, tend to occur where ese sequences are localized  <cit> . of the  <dig> different missense mutations reported in this paper,  <dig> were localized in ese sequences identified by ese finder. we analyzed the same mutation data set with rescueese and pesx that found respectively  <dig> and  <dig> mutations as lying in ese sites . a total of  <dig> mutations were identified as lying in ese sites by all the three algorithms. among these, only  <dig> caused the same type of predicted change . however, in only one case all the three algorithms equally predicted ese sites disruption without the concurrent creation of novel ese sites. since in our previous work we found that the abrogation of ese motifs identified by the first two algorithms does not always lead to a splicing defect  <cit> , we selected  <dig> hmlh <dig> and hmsh <dig> mutations with different predicted effects on eses . we examined their consequences in a splicing assay we already had available  <cit>  and previously reported to faithfully recapitulate in vivo splicing  <cit> . the criteria for selection were that the mutations should create or abolish one or more ese sites according to the predictions of at least one algorithm. all the minigene constructs were assembled in the pspl <dig> vector .

analysis of  <dig> hmlh <dig> and hmsh <dig> missense mutations shows that mutations altering splicing are situated preferentially in exon subjected to alternative splicing
it has to be said that the splicing assay demonstrated that exon  <dig> inclusion was only partial for all of these mutations, as it was for the wild type exon. this situation mimics what has been observed in vivo for hmlh <dig>  since alternative splicing of exon  <dig>  where the four mutations are located, has been reported by several authors  <cit> . in addition, mutation g1976c and its cognate g1976a were already reported to lead to aberrant splicing in vivo  <cit> . since this mutation does not alter any recognized enhancer or suppressor sequence, this data lend further support to the hypothesis of the presence of a different auxiliary element in this exonic region  <cit> . the other  <dig> mutations that in our splicing assay did change significantly the ratio of exon inclusion were c842t in hmlh <dig> exon  <dig>  c806t and c815t in hmsh <dig> exon  <dig>  and the two mutations in hmsh <dig> exon  <dig>  g1516t and c1600t . the splicing behaviour was correctly predicted by pesx and esefinder for four of these five, while rescue ese correctly predicted the consequences on splicing of the only mutation localizing in a sequence identified as a splicing enhancer by this algorithm. significantly all of these five mutations, as those in hmlh <dig> exon  <dig>  lie in exons that have been reported to be alternatively spliced in vitro  <cit> .

in conclusion, summarizing the results of the in vivo splicing analysis,  <dig> of the  <dig> mutations investigated caused a significant change in the splicing pattern and  <dig> led to a decrease of at least 50% of the rate of exon inclusion when compared to the wild type allele. the splicing consequences of these  <dig> mutations, correlated with esefinder predictions in  <dig> cases,  <dig> mutations were localized in ese or ess sequences identified by pesx which correctly predicted the splicing behaviour of  <dig> of them, while only  <dig> lie in ese sequences recognized by rescueese whose prediction correlated with the splicing behaviour of  <dig> of these  <dig>  furthermore, when exons were included or skipped completely in our assay they appeared to be insensitive to any change affecting ese or ess sequences. the higher correlation level of pesx predictions with the splicing pattern probably relies on the fact that, pesx differently from ese finder and rescue-ese predicts not only exonic enhancer sequences but also those with a suppressor effect. overall, the results of our splicing assay were comparable to the in vivo splicing profile of hmlh <dig> and hmsh <dig>  since exons normally presenting alternative splicing all showed an inclusion rate ranging from null to 73%, but never complete.

analysis of the  <dig> mutations with nnsplice, splicesite finder and genscan
the results of the transient transfection experiments demonstrated that the splicing pattern for the  <dig> selected mutations cannot be precisely predicted on the basis of esefinder, rescueese and pesx computations. we then decided to investigate their effects using additional in silico resources, namely the two splice site prediction programs nnsplice  <cit>  and splicesite finder  <cit> , and the gene prediction program genscan  <cit> . this latter program has been reported to reliably predict the splicing consequences of  <dig> different nucleotide substitutions in mlh <dig> and brca <dig> genes that caused an in vivo rna splicing defect  <cit> . the results obtained with these further computer analyses are reported in table  <dig>  of the  <dig> different missense mutations listed in the insight mutation database, only  <dig> led to a relatively large change  of genscan score. of these,  <dig> were in terminal exons,  <dig> were in the splicing junctions , while  <dig> were located in internal exons, far from the splicing sites. these latter mutations, g731a and g1976c, were both analyzed in our assay. the hmlh <dig> g731a mutation, that causes a consistent change of genscan score , is in the hmlh <dig> exon  <dig> that is not recognized as an internal exon by genscan and is skipped in the splicing assay regardless of the presence of the mutation. finally mutation g1976c which caused the largest decrease of genscan scores did lead to a significant increase in exon skipping . on the contrary, none of the mutations analyzed introduced any significant change in the splicing donor  and acceptor  site scores identified by nnsplice or in those calculated by splicesite finder for the sd and sa+bps sites.

alternative splicing and some mutations show a cell line specific effect
to investigate the possibility that some mutations may show tissue-specific differences, we used the same constructs analyzed in cos- <dig> cells to transfect two other cell lines, namely the cervical adenocarcinoma-derived hela cell line and the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line hep-3b. the rt-pcr results on rna extracted from these two cell lines  <dig> hours after transfection with the different mutated and normal constructs demonstrated a variable level of inclusion for the exons already reported to be alternatively spliced in vivo .

in particular, in the hela and hep-3b cells, the hmsh <dig> exon  <dig> inclusion level was decreased by 30% and 45%, respectively, compared to the level observed in cos- <dig> cells . the hmsh <dig> exon  <dig> and the hmlh <dig> exon  <dig> both showed a large increase in the rate of exon inclusion in hela cells compared to cos- <dig> . finally, the hmlh <dig> exon  <dig> inclusion was nearly halved in hela cells and decreased to one third in hep-3b.

we next analyzed the consequences on splicing of the mutations that had been able to cause splicing abnormalities when tested in cos- <dig> cells. although for the majority of the mutations analyzed the effects on the splicing proficiency were similar to those observed in cos- <dig> cells, for the mutations situated in the alternatively spliced exons there was an evident variability in the level of inclusion.

the most dramatic change was observed for the mutations g965a and g1012a in exon  <dig> of the hmsh <dig> gene. when transfected in cos- <dig> cells, these two mutations did not cause a change in the rate of exon inclusion compared to the normal allele, but in both hep-3b and hela cells, g1012a led to a 40% decrease in exon inclusion . since this mutation disrupts all three ese motifs identified by esefinder, it is possible that local changes in sr protein levels in both these two cell types cause the g1012a mutation to have an overt effect on splicing in hep-3b and hela cells but not in cos- <dig>  likewise, the hmsh <dig> exon  <dig> mutations g1516t and c1600t showed a decrease in the exon inclusion level by 70% in cos- <dig> and by 28% in hep-3b cells, but a very weak effect in the hela cellular background. the g1571c mutation in the same exon had no effect in cos- <dig> cells, while leading to a 60% exon inclusion increase in hep-3b and to a slight exon inclusion increase in hela . a further example of cell-specific effects was observed for the four hmlh <dig> mutations in exon  <dig>  all four mutations in this exon had a more severe effect when transfected in hela cells, compared to the consequences on splicing observed in cos- <dig> and hep-3b . in fact, the g1976c mutation consistently reduced the ratio of exon inclusion in all the three cell lines but led to almost complete exon skipping exclusively in hela cells. c1961t caused a slight increase in exon inclusion only in hela cells, while t1958g and a1963g both increased exon  <dig> inclusion levels in all three cell lines, with a higher rate of inclusion in hela cells.

discussion
evaluation of putative splicing mutations by computer programs
recent reports have shown that mutations in the coding region disrupting sequences recognized by splicing regulators such ese, ess or the recently identified composite exonic regulatory elements   <cit> , can be considered an additional mutation mechanism leading to disease in humans. this finding is particularly important for genetic counselling in hnpcc, where the pathogenicity assessment of any nucleotide substitution is crucial to correctly predict cancer risk.

several experimental or computational approaches, aiming to identify regulatory sequence motifs whose mutations are predicted to alter splicing, have been developed. all of these experimental approaches share the functional evaluation of short random oligomer sequences in reporter systems represented by short exons with weak splicing sites. however, these functional assays have been performed in highly purified in vitro systems that may not fully reflect in vivo splicing conditions. in addition, these sequences with a putative enhancer activity have not been tested in their natural context, which can be represented by clusters of several overlapping motifs with complex and often antagonistic interactions as already demonstrated for the cftr gene  <cit> . as a consequence, the ese sequences predicted by the algorithms developed using these strategies tend to overlap with true splicing enhancers only when they lie in short, weakly defined exons. however, human exons are on average  <dig> bp in size and 99% of them possess strong, well-defined splicing sites. the preferential colocalization of pathogenic mutations with ese sequences as compared with neutral polymorphisms has been reported  <cit>  but a systematic evaluation of missense mutations and neutral polymorphisms predicted to alter splicing have not been performed.

the splicing analysis we have performed suggests that the eses predicted by these algorithms are likely to act as real enhancer when mutations fall in short loosely defined exons that are more frequently expected to contain sequences promoting exon inclusion in the mature transcript. in fact, most of the nucleotide changes associated with altered splicing, lie in exons averaging  <dig> bp in size, well below the  <dig> bp dimension of a typical human exon  <cit> . furthermore, our data are supported from recent work  <cit>  that shows that the ability to function as an enhancer is dependent on its natural surrounding environment and ese position in the exon.

hence, thorough in silico analysis and the knowledge of the alternative splicing profile of the gene of interest may contribute to assign pathogenic significance. in this study we have analyzed all the pathogenic missense mutations reported in the hnpcc mutation database, with three ese prediction programs , then with two splice site prediction programs  and a gene prediction program . among the  <dig> mutations examined,  <dig> changed ese motifs scores predicted by esefinder, rescueese or pesx. of these,  <dig> were analyzed for their splicing proficiency with an in vivo splicing assay we had already used in the past. not surprisingly, the majority of mutations tested  did not alter the normal constitutive or alternative splicing pattern. indeed, most exons in the hmsh <dig> and hmlh <dig> genes are large and well defined with few notable exceptions. it is worthy of note that all of the  <dig> mutations that did affect splicing in the assay we used fall in exons for whom alternative splicing has been reported, or showing suboptimal splice site scores when analyzed with nnsplice and splicesite finder , or in exons not recognized by genscan . our data and a recent functional analysis performed on hmlh <dig> missense mutations  <cit>  suggest that most pathogenic substitutions in mmr genes impair the biological function of the protein rather than splicing proficiency. furthermore, when tested on mutations far from the splicing site, the prediction power of esefinder revealed a sensitivity lower than that recently reported  <cit> .

differences in the alternative splicing profile and in the mutations effects between cell types
a large amount of data is accumulating, supporting the hypothesis that the global alternative splicing profile reflects tissue identity, and that alternative splicing acts independently on different sets of genes, defining tissue-specific expression profiles. the expression levels of antagonistic splicing factors, such as hnrnpa <dig> and sf2/asf, have been shown to affect splice site selection  <cit> , and colon cancer progression  <cit> . thus, if a tissue-specific regulation of pre-mrna splicing exists and depends on local differences of the regulatory factors concentration, it is likely that some mutations may show tissue- or cell-specific effects. however, the presence of such variability has not been thoroughly investigated. we therefore decided to investigate whether the mutations analyzed in our in vivo assay showed a different splicing profile in three different cell lines. an invariant pattern of splicing was observed for the constitutive exons but intriguingly for the mutations lying in alternative exons, both the mutated and the normal alleles showed variability in the ratio of exon inclusion. in fact, differences were observed both in the level of inclusion of alternative normal exons and in the magnitude of changes caused by mutations localizing in these exons . these results confirm the recent findings based on microarray analysis, demonstrating that human tissues show rather divergent patterns of alternative splicing, yet correlated with differences in the splicing factor expression across tissues  <cit> . as a consequence, the net results of a mutation altering the splicing pattern might derive from local changes in the concentration of splicing modulators.

both mlh <dig> and msh <dig> genes show extensive alternative splicing with as many as eight different isoforms reported for mlh <dig> and seven for msh <dig>  <cit> . more than half of these alternative isoforms are predicted to give rise to truncated proteins. some of these isoforms have been reported to be expressed also in normal individuals and tissues  <cit>  but no studies have assessed quantitatively the expression of these splice variants at the rna level.

our systematic analysis of different mutations in the hmlh <dig> and hmsh <dig> genes in three human cell lines, shows that a single mutation can provoke quite diverse consequences in different cell types. similar results were obtained when the three cell lines were transfected with exons reported to be alternatively spliced in vivo, suggesting that cell specificity may nudge splice selection toward a variable ratio of exon inclusion vs skipping. in rapidly replicating tissues immunohistochemical analysis have demonstrated that mlh1/msh <dig> proteins are highly expressed  <cit> . therefore, in tissues where the requirements for protection from dna replication errors are inherently higher, the relative abundance of isoforms with different mmr proficiency may be critical in determining the time and the frequency of cancer pathogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
our study indicates that missense mutations in mlh <dig> and msh <dig> are likely to affect splicing only when located in weak alternative exons. however when they do so, they might modulate in a tissue specific manner cancer onset and its phenotypic manifestations.
