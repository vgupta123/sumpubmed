BACKGROUND
dna restriction-modification systems  are prokaryotic tools against invasion of foreign dnas into cells  <cit> . they play an important evolutionary role as subcellular barriers restricting horizontal gene transfer and thereby providing microbial biodiversity. usually, rms comprise of a restriction endonuclease  and modification dna methyltransferase  enzyme recognizing the same short 4- <dig> nucleotide sequence. rms functioning includes methylation of recognition dna sequences by mtase. all non-modified sites can be cut by a cognate rease  <cit> . type ii reases are indispensable tools in creating recombinant dna molecules  <cit> . their widespread practical application has stimulated research to discover and characterize more of these systems. currently, more than  <dig> different sequences corresponding to reases of type ii alone are listed in rebase, the database holding all known and many putative rms  <cit> .

the high number of known rms is reflected also in high diversity of their organization or functioning and, hypothetically, in multiplicity of their evolutionary pathways. one of these pathways could be fusion of preexisting orfs with formation of a gene capable of producing a protein with an array of new activities and functions. it could be suggested that type iic rms carrying both rease and mtase in a single polypeptide might appear by this mechanism  <cit> . here we report direct evidence how a fully functional type iic rease could appear by fusion of the appropriate genes as a result of a few point mutations.

as an object of our experiment eco29ki rms was chosen. this rms is carried by the natural plasmid peco <dig> found in clinical e. coli 29ki isolate  <cit> . on this plasmid there were genes coding for  <dig> aa rease and  <dig> aa dna mtase  <cit> . by nomenclature eco29ki rms belongs to iip group as one recognizing the palindromic site  <cit> . its rease contains giy-yig nuclease domain that was identified in homing endonucleases, dna repair and recombination enzymes, and restriction endonucleases  <cit> . recently its mechanism of action was established: r.eco29ki monomers dimerize on a single cognate dna molecule forming the catalytically active complex  <cit> . an eco29ki rms is organized in such a way that rease orf precedes mtase orf, and the rease stop codon and the mtase start codon overlap . similar organization is also characteristic to such well-known rms as sali and hindiii. using site-directed mutagenesis, eco29ki r and m orfs were fused to give a fully functional hybrid protein. it was purified and characterized. its biochemical properties, namely, rease and mtase specificities and the optima of reaction conditions were compared with those of the original enzymes.

apparently, a similar mechanism of gene fusion via natural point mutations/deletions/insertions/invertions/translocations could give type iic reases as well as bifunctional mtases like ssoii-related enzymes and bifunctional mtases like foki and llai  <cit> . apart from methyltransferase, these proteins also possess separate domains involved in transcriptional regulation  or methylation . it should be noted that gene fusion is facilitated by the head-to-tail gene orientation, which is quite common for many rms. for example, the following type ii rm systems are organized in this way: acci, bani, bsp6i, bsubi, cfr9i, ddei, eagi, ecopi, ecop <dig>  ecori, fnudi, haeiii, hgibi, hgici, hgicii, hgidi, hgiei, hgigi, hhaii, hincii, hindiii, hinfi, hpai, mboii, mwoi, ncoi, ndei, ngomi, ngopii, nlaiii, paer7i, rsri, sali, sau3a, sau96i, taqi, tthhb8i, xbai, and xmai, and many more can be found in rms database  <cit> . thus, their unidentified type iic bifunctional derivatives could exist in nature.

RESULTS
construction of overproducing strain and purification of rm.eco29ki
to construct an overproducing strain for the protein rm.eco29ki, orfs of eco29ki rease and mtase were amplified from the natural plasmid peco <dig> where they are oriented as shown in figure 1a <cit> ,. on this plasmid the stop codon of eco29ki rease and the start codon of eco29ki mtase overlap. subsequently they were cloned in the same orientation into the pet19mod vector. by site-directed mutagenesis their separating stop and start codons were substituted for  <dig> glycine codons, as shown in figure 1b, thus forming the eco29ki.rm gene. the resulting rm.eco29ki polypeptide contains both rease and mtase enzymes joint by a flexible  <dig> glycine hinge and  <dig> his-tag on its n terminus.

the purification scheme for rm.eco29ki was based on affinity  chromatography. from a ni-cam column rm.eco29ki was eluted by linear steps of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mm imidazole. finally,  <dig> ml of cell culture gave about  <dig>  mg of >98% purified enzyme  with a molecular weight of ~ <dig> kda.

when the stop codon of eco29ki rease gene was substituted for glycine without modifying the first methionine codon of eco29ki mtase gene, expression of m.eco29ki, but not rm.eco29ki, was detected . hypothetically, it might happen due to a pronounced secondary structure of mrna in the region corresponding to r.eco29ki orf or, as it was reported personally by m. nagornykh, to transcription initiation from an alternative promoter closely preceding m.eco29ki orf  <cit> .

characterization of rm.eco29ki rease activity
two enzymes, r.eco29ki and rm.eco29ki, purified to homogeneity, were assayed for their recognition specificity and catalytic reaction optimum at varied concentrations of nacl, kcl, temperature and ph. r.eco29ki was purified as described previously  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows hydrolysis patterns of φ80vir dna with r.eco29ki  and with rm.eco29ki . the patterns are the same, so the hybrid protein rm.eco29ki retained the specificity of r.eco29ki.

then the enzyme rm.eco29ki was assayed for catalytic reaction optimum. the maximal catalytic rease activity of the hybrid protein was observed at 0- <dig> mm nacl; 0- <dig> mm kcl,  <dig> mm mgcl2; ph  <dig> , at 30-37°c . table  <dig> presents reaction optimum comparison for r.eco29ki and rm.eco29ki. as seen, the optima were slightly changed:  <dig> mm less for nacl,  <dig> mm less for kcl, and  <dig> unit less for ph. it means that after fusion the biochemical properties of the rease part of the protein were changed, despite its intact amino acid sequence. under optimal conditions r.eco29ki had a specific activity of  <dig> au/pmol, whereas rm.eco29ki had  <dig> au/pmol amounting to 33% of the native value. thus, after fusion with m.eco29ki its activity was decreased by about  <dig> times.

characterization of rm.eco29ki mtase activity
the biochemical characterization of eco29ki mtase is presented in  <cit> . the enzyme methylates the second cytosine in the sequence ccmegcgg. specificity of rm.eco29ki mtase activity was proved to be the same, because there was no incorporation of labeled methyl groups into substrates pretreated with m.eco29ki enzyme and non-labeled adomet. the optima of reaction conditions also remained unchanged: both enzymes showed their maximal activities at  <dig> mm nacl;  <dig> mm edta; ph  <dig> - <dig> , and 37°c. under optimal conditions m.eco29ki had a specific activity of  <dig> au/pmol, whereas rm.eco29ki had  <dig> au/pmol amounting to 80% of the native value. thus, after fusion with r.eco29ki, activity of its mtase part was almost unchanged.

characterization of rm.eco29ki functioning in vivo
to characterize in vivo functioning of new rms, we performed phage restriction experiments. in these experiments 100-fold dilutions of phage λvir  were spotted on lawns of bacterial cells. the results are presented in figure  <dig>  bl21xp29k <dig> cells carry only gene coding for eco29ki mtase and lack eco29ki rease activity, which allows evaluating total concentration of infective phage λvir virions. bl21xpeco <dig> cells carry natural peco <dig> plasmid, having both mtase and rease activities of the wild type eco29ki rms. bl21xpeco29rm cells carry gene coding for rm.eco29ki enzyme on the natural peco <dig> plasmid. bl21xp29k11+p29rm cells carry genes coding for m.eco29ki and rm.eco29ki enzymes. as seen from the figure, rm.eco29ki induction by low concentration of iptg  led to a 102-fold cell protection against phage invasions, so that only one out of  <dig> virions could infect the cells. the same values were obtained for rm.eco29ki enzyme carried on natural peco <dig> plasmid . under the given conditions wild type eco29ki rms protected cells more effectively, giving a 104-fold restriction, so that only one out of  <dig>   <dig> virions could infect the cells. thus, the new rms protected its host cells  <dig> times less effectively than the wild type rms. but  <dig> phage restriction value reflects the ability of the new rms to protect cells against foreign dna invasion; so this function of the wild type rms was conserved in the rm.eco29ki rms.

characterization of rm.eco29ki behavior in vitro
to assess the in vitro interaction of the bifunctional enzyme rm.eco29ki with dna and the effect of adomet on its rease activity, we incubated this protein with phage φ80vir dna in conditions optimal for rease  and mtase  in the absence or presence of excess adomet . in mtase reaction mixture we substituted  <dig> mm edta for  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> to supply magnesium ions to the rease part of the enzyme. while in rease buffer the hydrolysis patterns looked identical both in the presence and absence of adomet, in mtase buffer with adomet a slightly incomplete hydrolysis could be observed even at the lowest enzyme dilutions , which could be explained by dna methylation with the mtase part of the enzyme. it follows from these results that in vitro rm.eco29ki enzymatic reaction is strongly biased towards dna hydrolysis, while only a small portion of dna can be modified in the same reaction mixture; and that adomet does not influence rease activity of the enzyme, unlike other type iic proteins known so far.

discussion
nomenclature of the rm.eco29ki enzyme
to date, the following  <dig> proteins have been proved to show both rease and mtase activities by one polypeptide chain: aloi, bcgi, bsemii, bseri, bsgi, bsplu11iii, cjei, eco57i, haeiv, mmei, ppii, and tsti  <cit> . they can be considered as members of the type iic rms group. their properties are given in table  <dig>  all of them also belong to iib  or to iig  groups of rms  <cit> . the rm.eco29ki protein also falls in the category of iic enzymes, but differs from its regular members by many features. it recognizes a true non-interrupted palindromic sequence; it cuts within the recognition site; its rease is not influenced by adomet; and its mtase belongs to m5c type, while others contain m6a type mtases. altogether, properties of rm.eco29ki expand the limits of type iic enzymes.

the role of gene fusion in molecular evolution of rms
in our study a fully functional hybrid polypeptide was generated by fusion of eco29ki rease and mtase proteins. new protein had rease and mtase specificities of the original enzymes. its mtase activity was almost unchanged and amounted to 80% of that of the m.eco29ki under optimal reaction conditions for both enzymes:  <dig> mm nacl;  <dig> mm edta; ph  <dig> , and 37°c  <cit> . its rease activity was decreased by three times, which could be attributed to increased steric hindrance in interaction with substrate. besides, the reaction optimum for rease activity of rm.eco29ki differed from that of the r.eco29ki as follows:  <dig> mm less for ,  <dig> mm less for , and  <dig> unit less for ph . the particular reason for this shift is unclear because many physical and chemical properties of the protein, such as molecular weight, isoelectric point, total charge, geometry of the protein, surface charge distribution, etc., were different from those of the original proteins. hypothetically, the gap between their properties could yield as a result of the natural selection, after many generations, a novel protein with altered biochemical properties and different functions in the cell.

this work presents experimental evidence for molecular evolution of rms or multifunctional proteins in general. it has been directly shown that a few point mutations can result in a protein with a novel combination of activities and altered properties. on the one hand, it may be considered as a molecular mechanism for appearance of type iic rms enzymes. figure  <dig> and  <dig> show a schematic gene organization of the described type iic rms. as seen, all of them could result from fusion of head-to-tail oriented endonuclease and methyltransferase orfs. possible involvement of gene fusion was proposed for the formation of aloi, bsemii, cjei, eco57i, haeiv, and mmei. the enzymes aloi, cjei, and haeiv probably resulted from fusion of hsds, hsdm and rease domains; eco57i - from mod and res subunits of type iii enzymes; while bsemii and mmei - from rease and mtase domains  <cit> .

it can be predicted that novel type iic rms may appear via fusion of genes from bipartite rms having head-to-tail gene organization. this type of gene organization is quite common for rms of all types. type i rms such as cfra, ecoa, ecob, ecod, ecoe, ecok, ecor <dig>  stysb, stysi, stysp, and stysq; type ii rms such as acci, bani, bsp6i, bsubi, cfr9i, ddei, eagi, ecopi, ecop <dig>  ecori, fnudi, haeiii, hgibi, hgici, hgicii, hgidi, hgiei, hgigi, hhaii, hincii, hindiii, hinfi, hpai, mboii, mwoi, ncoi, ndei, ngomi, ngopii, nlaiii, paer7i, rsri, sali, sau3a, sau96i, taqi, tthhb8i, xbai, and xmai, all have head-to-tail gene orientation, thus being good candidates for originating new type iic enzymes  <cit> . these possibilities could be facilitated by increased affinity of dna mtases for hemimethylated substrates in comparison with non-methylated ones, unlike their rease counterparts. therefore, if a fused rms appeared from preexisting bipartite rms and its mtase activity was lower of the original enzyme, its propagation would be facilitated by facts that all recognition sites in the host genome were methylated or, after replication, hemimethylated by the preexisting enzyme and that it had increased affinity to hemimethylated substrates. otherwise, decreased mtase activity of a new fused rms could lead to appearance of unprotected recognition sequences in host genome, which will be cut by rease, host cells will die and this rms will not propagate in a bacterial population.

on the other hand, this study provides an example of a more general mechanism for gaining new functions by existing proteins. hypothetically, any pair of orfs can be joint in-frame by point mutations/deletions/insertions/inversions/translocations or their combinations . then the newly generated polypeptide may serve as an evolutionary intermediate for the natural selection in improving old or accommodating new functions in the cell. for example, m.ssoii-related bifunctional enzymes, including its izoschizomers, with regulatory and mtase domains could arise by natural fusion of the appropriate orfs at some stages of their evolutionary history  <cit> . the latter suggestion is supported by the presence of nlax mtase, a close homolog of m.ssoii without the regulatory n-terminal domain. as shown in figure  <dig>  both polypeptides display high identity after  <dig> amino acids of the m.ssoii n-terminal domain known to be involved in its gene autoregulation  <cit> . similar fusion of preexisting head-to-tail oriented orfs coding for c-protein and endonuclease in bamhi, eco72i, muni, pvuii, smai rms, could give reases with transcription regulatory functions. depending on gene organization, there are also possibilities for fusion of two mtases from preexisting rms, such as dpnii and hgai, leading to bifunctional mtases like foki and llai  <cit> .

in principle, any other adjacent gene of appropriate orientation could be fused with the rease or mtase part of rms. in this case the fact that rms elimination is lethal for cells would defend the fused orf from being lost  <cit> . it occurs because long-lasting endonucleolitic activity results in multiple cuts on non-protected genomic dna, thereby killing cells that lack rms. thus, joining rms genes would promote maintenance of a fused orf and its spreading in bacterial populations, provided their functioning is not disturbed.

practical applications of gene fusion for generating reases with novel recognition sites
restriction enzymes are robust tools for the recombinant dna technology. despite the fact that more than  <dig> enzymes with different recognition sites have been isolated from various bacterial strains, many specificities have not been discovered  <cit> . to create enzymes with altered recognition specificities, methylation activity-based selection  and target recognition domain  reassortment  <cit>  approaches were proposed. using these techniques, bifunctional enzymes of type iic such as eco57i, aloi, ppii, and tsti were manipulated to yield a generation with novel specificities. most importantly, both of their activities operated on the same target sequence, thus providing a possibility to use the dna-modification activity of these enzymes for the selection of mutants with altered sequence specificity. to enlarge the list of enzymes available for these manipulations, a gene fusion approach, similar to one used in this work, could be applied. by this procedure, hundreds of bifunctional enzymes could be created, e.g., from type i and iii head-to-tail oriented rms, thus giving an opportunity of significant contribution to the existing recognition specificities.

CONCLUSIONS
altogether, our work presents an example of molecular mechanism for appearance of type iic restriction-modification and ssoii mtase-related enzymes as well as other multifunctional proteins. it demonstrates that gene fusion could play an important role in evolution of restriction-modification systems and be responsible for enzyme subclass interconversion. based on the proposed approach, hundreds of novel type iic enzymes could be generated from head-to-tail oriented type i, ii and iii restriction and modification genes. these new bifunctional polypeptides could be useful for creating enzymes with altered recognition specificities. lastly, our work shows that protein fusion can change biochemical properties of the involved enzymes, thus giving a starting point for their further evolutionary divergence, which, after many generations, gives a novel protein with both altered biochemical properties and different functions in the cell.
