BACKGROUND
ctpa proteins cleave peptide bonds at the carboxyl-terminus  of polypeptides, and are primarily involved in posttranslational protein processing, maturation or degradation in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells  <cit> . these enzymes belong to an unusual type of serine peptidases that carry a catalytic dyad  at the active site, instead of the well-known ser-his-asp catalytic triad commonly found in most serine proteases  <cit> . the first ctpa was described in escherichia coli albeit under different identities: either as tail-specific protease  or processing involving the c-terminal cleavage . this e. coli enzyme is an endopeptidase which cleaves peptide substrates containing apolar residues and a free α–carboxylate at the c-terminus  <cit> . to date, ctpa enzymes have been characterized in some higher plants, algae, and bacteria  <cit> . in photosynthetic higher plants and cyanobacteria, ctpa is an essential peptidase in photosystem ii  reaction center  <cit> , where the enzyme cleaves a precursor form of d <dig> protein, a key subunit of ps ii, at c-terminal extension which consists of typically 9- <dig> amino acid residues  <cit> . non-photosynthetic bacterial ctpa enzymes exhibit a great diversity in sequence, suggesting that they have gained different functions during evolution. the e. coli ctpa is a protein with an apparent mass of about 80 kda in maxicell and in vitro systems  <cit> . the enzyme cleaves a periplasmic penicillin-binding protein  <dig> in e. coli and is involved in thermal and osmotic stresses and pathogenesis  <cit> . in borrelia burgdorferi, ctpa processes outer-membrane proteins p <dig> and bb <dig>  <cit> , whereas the same enzyme functions in bacterial biofilm formation in rhizobium leguminosarum <cit> , and is involved in cell morphology and intracellular survival in burkholderia mallei and brucella suis <cit> . furthermore, biochemical traits of bacterial ctpa have indicated that these enzymes are resistant to a wide variety of conventional protease inhibitors  <cit> , which makes them potential good candidate proteases for biotechnology and industry application. proteases constitute one of the three largest groups of industrial enzymes, accounting for about 60% of the total sales of enzymes worldwide  <cit> , and they have been used in detergent, food, agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries  <cit> . microorganisms are the main resources of hydrolases from which most commercial hydrolases are derived  <cit> . this is mainly because microbes exhibit much greater diversity than multicellular organisms .

as aquaculture industry is a fast developing area in china, sediments of aquaculture ponds have developed into novel environmental niches that are very rich in different nutrients, allowing diverse microbes to thrive. recently a highly active esterase with exceptional resistance to organic solvents has been obtained from a sample collected from the environment  <cit> . here we screened for protease-producing bacteria from sediment samples collected from the same fishery ponds in shanghai, china, and found one of the isolates, paenibacillus lautus chn <dig>  exhibited a high protease activity. a ctpa gene was cloned from this bacterium and expressed in e. coli using the pet-28a expression system. the resulting recombinant ctpa protein was purified and characterized. our data indicated that p. lautus ctpa is a novel endopeptidase, exhibiting a strong application potential in biotechnology.

RESULTS
screening and identification of a protease-producing bacterium
we have developed a functional screening assay in which extracellular protease-producing bacteria form clear zones around their colonies on selective skim-milk agar plates . employing the assay to screen for protease-producing bacteria from a sediment sample of fishery ponds identified several positive colonies, among which the isolate chn <dig> produced very large clear zone of hydrolysis on the selective plate, suggesting that it could encode one or multiple highly active protease. its 16s rrna gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction  using the 27 f and 1492r primers, and the gene sequence was determined . database searches with the 16s rrna gene revealed that it displayed 96-99% nucleotide sequence identity with the corresponding genes derived from dozens of paenibacillus bacteria. the phylogenetic position of the isolate was studied by comparing the 16s rrna gene sequence with a selected set of paenibacillus bacteria retrieved from the genbank databases and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the mega <dig>  . strain chn <dig> fell into the clade of p. lautus, suggesting it was closely related to this species.

bacteria of paenibacillus species are widespread: they have been isolated from different environments including soil, plant, insect and aqueous samples. a very striking feature for these bacteria is that they exhibit great versatility in metabolic capacities. these bacteria produce various extracellular enzymes such as polysaccharide-degrading enzymes and proteases, several of which have shown strong potential in industrial applications  <cit> .

characterization of the p. lautus chn <dig> revealed the following: cells of this organism are gram-positive rods, oxidase- and catalase-positive, and form transparent non-pigmented colonies on nutrient agar media. it grows optimally at 30°c, ph  <dig>  and in the presence of 3% nacl. this strain was negative in the indole test, and did not produce h2s. neither did it hydrolyze or utilize starch, dextrin, d-xylose, d-galactose, d-ribose, inositol, maleic acid or sodium succinate. the bacterium was tested positive in the voges-proskauer, and methyl-red assays. more importantly, it could grow in the medium containing α /β casein, sucrose, d-frucose, lactose, d-sorbito or glycerol as the sole energy . in summary, this isolate showed a few distinct features such as utilization of d-sorbito and citrate, voges-proskauer test, h2s production and nitrite reduction, which deviated itself from the other known p. lautus strain  <cit> .

molecular cloning of a ctpa gene in paenibacillus lautus chn26
we were interested in studying proteases encoded in this bacterium. recently, the complete genome of paenibacillus sp.y412mc <dig> was reported   <cit> . to gain an insight into what gene product could be responsible for the hydrolytic activity of p. lautus chn <dig> in the skim milk assay, a few putative protease genes of paenibacillus were investigated, in which the c-terminal protease could be responsible for the observed activity .

p. lautus encodes only one putative c-terminal protease, although many other bacillus species  encodes two, namely ctpa and ctpb. a few ctpb enzymes have been characterized and it has been shown that these enzymes play important functions in cellular process such as sporulation  <cit> . however, to our knowledge, none of ctpa enzymes derived from a gram-positive bacterium have been characterized thus far.

the ctpa gene from p. lautus chn <dig> was amplified using the primer pair ctp1-f and ctp1-r  targeting the corresponding gene sequence of paenibacillus sp.y412mc <dig> , which was re-classed as p. lautus recently  <cit> . a pcr product of the expected size  was obtained from p. lautus chn <dig>  and the ctpa gene sequence of p. lautus chn <dig> was determined : an open reading frame of  <dig>  bp encoding a protein of  <dig> aa with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. the deduced amino acid sequence displayed high sequence identities to putative c-terminal proteases encoded in paenibacillus species , all of which have not been characterized. furthermore, p. lautus ctpa showed relatively lower sequence similarities  to all characterized bacterial ctpa proteins, including those encoded in e. coli, bartonella bacilliformis, b. burgdorferi, b. suis, b. mallei, and pseudomonas aeruginosa <cit> . these ctpa sequences were retrieved from the genbank database and analyzed by multiple sequence alignments. this analysis revealed that ctpa of the p. lautus  contains the catalytic dyad  and substrate-binding b domain, also designated as pdz motif  <cit> , both of which are highly conserved in all known ctpa proteins .

the multiple sequence alignments were also used to construct phylogenetic trees to gain an insight to their diversity and classification. this analysis revealed three families for ctpa enzymes, namely family i, ii, and iii . the ctpa enzymes of e. coli and p. aeruginosa belong to family i, the enzymes encoded in b. bacilliformis, b. burgdorferi, b. suis, b. mallei and synechocystis sp. fall into family iii, whereas ctpap forms family ii with several ctpa entries identified in the genbank databases. notably, family ii of ctpa proteins are derived from diverse bacterial species phylogenetically distantly related.

expression and purification of the ctpap protein in e. coli bl21
the ctpap structural gene  was amplified with the primer pair ctp1-f <dig> and ctp1-r <dig> . the pcr product was cloned into the expression vector pet-28a, giving pet28a-ctpap. the expression plasmid was transformed into e. coli bl <dig>  and kanr transformants were screened by colony pcr to test for the presence of pet28a-ctpap. positive transformants were cultured in lb-kanamycin medium, and the expression of ctpap gene was analyzed by sds-page. as presented in figure  <dig> , one band appeared at the size corresponding to the calculated molecular mass of ctpap in the pet28a-ctpap transformant, but absent from the e. coli bl <dig> cells carrying pet28a , suggesting that the protein band represented the recombinant ctpap resulting from episomic ctpap expression.

the recombinant ctpap protein with twelve his-tags was purified by affinity purification via a ni-nta his bind resin column. then, the purified enzyme was concentrated and desalted using an amicon ultra- <dig> centrifugal filter device. figure  <dig>  shows the purified ctpap protein with an apparent molecular mass of approximately  <dig> kda, giving a protein yield of about  <dig>  mg of per 1 g wet biomass and a relative activity of  <dig>  u/mg protein using β-casein as the substrate.

substrate specificity of the p. lautus ctpa enzyme
to examine protease activity of the recombinant ctpap protein, e. coli bl <dig> strain harboring the expression plasmid pet28a-ctpap was streaked on the skim milk agar plates containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and iptg, and incubated at 37°c for 36 h. clear zones of hydrolysis around the pet28a-ctpap transformant appeared on the selective agar plates. the colonies of e. coli bl <dig> containing only pet28a did not form any clear zones in the skim milk assay .

the purified ctpap enzyme was then assayed for proteolytic activity using two different casein substrates, β-casein and α s1-casein. the purified enzyme was incubated with each substrate at 30°c for  <dig> -6 h, and reaction products were analyzed by sds-page. as shown in figure  <dig>  ctpap cleaved β-casein into shorter fragments  as for other bacterial ctpa enzymes . notably, α s1-casein appeared to serve as a better substrate for ctpap degradation than β-casein, as the reaction with the former substrate was ca. 3-fold faster than the degradation of the latter substrate under the same reaction condition . this result is in a good agreement with the high protease activity of p. lautus chn <dig> in the skim milk assay since α s1-casein is a predominant component of the substrates in the assay.

to reveal the cleavage sites of ctpap on the casein substrates, we analyzed the digest products using a matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time of flight mass spectrometer  with the resulting data summarized in table  <dig>  ctpap cleavage of both substrates yielded multiple peptide fragments of different sizes, suggesting that cleavage by ctpap lacked stringency in site selection on each substrate. ctpap cleaved β-casein   <cit>  at four sites at the c-terminus, including glu210-pro <dig>  leu213-gly <dig>  gly214-pro <dig> and pro215-val <dig>  all of which are apolar amino acid residues. it has been reasoned that ctpa enzymes rely on the recognition of scissile bonds at c-terminus of the substrates for c-terminal protease activity, giving typically oligopeptide products of 9- <dig> residues. such cleavage preferences have been reported previously for e. coli ctpa enzyme  <cit> . similarly, for the α s1-casein substrate of  <dig> aa   <cit> , the enzyme recognized three peptide bonds at c-terminus and produced oligopeptides of 7- <dig> aa. however, interesting differences in site selection on α s1-casein were observed: all three cleavage sites of ctpap contain polar residues at c-terminus of the substrate , namely asn, ser and lys, which is in contrast to its site selection on β-casein where only nonpolar residues are sites of cleavage .

in addition, ctpap also cleaved at six sites on β-casein located more distantly from the c-terminus, including ala15-arg <dig>  gln69-thr <dig>  val107-met <dig>  gln175-ser <dig>  gln175-ser <dig> and gln182-ser <dig>  such internal cleavage also occurred for the α s1-casein substrate where five active sites were revealed for ctpap cleavage, including leu35-leu <dig>  phe38-phe <dig>  asn53-glu <dig>  ser130-ala <dig> and ala131-glu <dig>  to our knowledge, among all ctpa enzymes characterized to date, the e. coli ctpa represents the only one that also cleaves its substrate at multiple sites  <cit> . furthermore, the two ctpa enzymes show a great diversity in internal cleavage sites: the only site that is in common for them is ala15-arg <dig>  such functional diversity of ctpa enzymes is often advantageous for their application in biotechnology.

in contrast, several known ctpa enzymes have showed strong stringencies in site selection of peptide cleavage. for example, the amino acid residues  at the cleavage sites of c-terminus extension in pd <dig> are very well conserved in photosynthetic organisms  <cit> . we also tested ctpap cleavage on this substrate using a synthetic oligopeptide  comprising  <dig> aa  of the pd <dig> c-terminus. incubation of the s <dig> substrate with ctpap at 30°c for 3 h revealed that this bacterial ctpa enzyme partially broke down the substrate, yielding n <dig> and c <dig> oligopeptides . however, ctpap appears to be much less active on s <dig> than that on the casein substrates. in addition, ctpap failed to show any detectable haemolytic activity. taken together, ctpa enzymes fall into two distinct categories, in regard of site selection stringency. photosynthetic ctpa enzymes exhibit strong amino acid sequence specificity and play important cellular functions, whereas nonphotosynthetic ctpas, such as the e. coli ctpa and ctpap do not show a strong site preference in cleavage, and these enzymes degrade their substrates at multiple sites. apparently, ctpa enzymes of the latter category show a strong application potential in protein degradation at an industrial level.

effect of temperature and ph on p. lautus ctpa activity and stability
the temperature profile of ctpap was determined for the temperature range of 10°c to 80°c at ph  <dig>  using β-casein as a substrate. as illustrated in figure 7a, ctpap displayed maximum enzyme activity at 30°c, retaining up to  <dig> % of its initial activity at 20-35°c. the enzyme activity decreased steeply as the temperature increased above 50°c, indicating that the ctpap is a mesophilic enzyme.

to examine the effect of temperature on ctpap stability, aliquotes of the purified enzyme were incubated at various temperatures for 3 h, and the residual activity of the treated protein was assayed at 30°c, ph  <dig> . as shown in figure 7b, ctpap exhibited considerable stability and retained more than 95% of its initial activity after treatment at 10-30°c for 3 h. treating the enzyme at 50°c resulted in residual activity of 58%, and further elevating pretreated temperature  yielded a steep reduction of the enzyme activity, suggesting that ctpa is a mesophilic enzyme.

the effect of ph on ctpap activity and stability was studied at 30°c, the optimal reaction temperature. as shown in figure 7c, the enzyme displays a high activity at ph  <dig> - <dig> . the residual activity declined sharply at either higher ph or lower ph values. the similar ph dependency of enzyme activity has been reported for other recombinant ctpa enzymes  <cit> . the effect of ph on enzyme stability was assayed by pre-incubating the purified ctpap at various ph values for 12 h at 4°c. as shown in figure 7d, ctpap exhibited considerable stability at ph  <dig> - <dig> . however, the enzyme activity diminished more than 50% after prolonged incubation in either more acidic  or more alkaline  conditions.

to date, very few previous researches have reported activity of proteases at room temperature  <cit> . the high activity at room temperature and stability at an alkaline ph render ctpap as an ideal enzyme in a range of industry application.

effect of metal ions and protease inhibitors on p. lautus ctpa activity
to address the effect of metal ions on ctpa activity, aliquotes of the purified enzyme were individually incubated with zncl <dig>  cacl <dig>  mgcl <dig>  bacl <dig>  cucl <dig>  mncl <dig> and kcl at 1-10 mm concentration at 30°c for 1 h, and residual activities were measured under the standard assay condition . comparing to the control, mn2+ and ca2+ elevated ctpa activity by  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, whereas ba2+, cu2+ and zn2+ strongly inhibited enzyme activity, reducing the activity by 30-50%. these results resemble those reported for e. coli ctpa  <cit> .

tolerance to metal chelator  and protease inhibitors is very important for any enzymes to be explored in industrial application. as shown in figure  <dig>  ctpap displayed remarkable resistance to the conventional inhibitors of serine proteases, as no loss of activity was observed after treating the enzyme with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride  or diisopropyl fluorophosphate , indicating that the enzyme belongs to an unusual type of serine proteases. protease inhibitor tolerance has been reported for e. coli ctpa  <cit> . however, ctpap showed much stronger tolerance to the inhibitors tested, since it retained the maximal activity at inhibitor concentrations that were 5-20-fold higher than those reported for e. coli enzyme, further arguing for the diversity in biochemical properties of ctpa enzymes. in addition, treating the enzyme with 10 mm edta did not yield any effect on the enzyme activity, suggesting that ctpap is not a metalloprotease.

effect of detergents and organic solvents on p. lautus ctpa activity
in contrast to distinct stability of ctpap in the presence of protease inhibitors, detergents including sodium dodecyl sulfate , tween  <dig> and tween  <dig> greatly inhibited the enzyme activity, reducing about 53-62% of its activity at a final concentration of  <dig> % . likewise, ctpap was also sensitive to all the organic solvents tested in this study including acetone, acetonitrile, 1-butanol, ethanol, methanol, 2-propanol, dimethyl sulfoxide  and dimethylformamide , as it lost 42-72% activity under the treatments with each of the organic solvents at a final concentration of 1% .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a novel carboxyl-terminal protease gene was identified from a newly isolated paenibacillus lautus chn <dig> strain, designated ctpap. this gene encodes a mature protein of  <dig> aa with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda, displaying 29-38% amino acid sequence identity to a few characterized bacterial ctpa enzymes. ctpap was expressed as a recombinant protein in escherichia coli bl <dig> using the pet expression system. the purified ctpap protein displayed endopeptidase activity, and it effectively cleaves β- and α s1- casein substrates at either c-terminal or multiple internal sites. comparing ctpap with other characterized ctpa proteins revealed interesting diversity in their cleavage site selection, and ctpap also exhibited high activity at a room temperature with strong tolerance to protease inhibitors. the distinct biochemical properties positioned ctpap as a novel endopeptidase with an application potential in industry and biotechnological applications.
