BACKGROUND
white campion, silene latifolia , emits a diverse array of volatiles to attract sphingid, geometrid, and noctuid moths for pollination  <cit> . this species also shows a pronounced day-night rhythm in odor emission, with the key compounds predominately emitted during the night  <cit> . among commonly known pollinators for this species, hadena bicruris, a noctuid moth, is a specialist nursery pollinator and obligate seed predator  <cit> . female h. bicruris are not only attracted for nectaring but also for oviposition into female s. latifolia flowers  <cit> . the larvae nurture on developing seeds  <cit>  and consume almost one fourth of the fruits developed  <cit> . available experimental evidence indicates that the hadena-silene relationship can swing in between mutualism and antagonism  <cit> .

recently, the scent composition of s. latifolia and related species has been identified and studied for behavioral activity in the pollinators  <cit> . a large set of volatile compounds has been found in the s. latifolia floral odor bouquet  <cit>  and these compounds comprise three major categories: fatty acid derivatives, aromatics, and terpenoids  <cit> . using wind-tunnel bioassays, dötterl et al.  <cit>  investigated pollinators interaction with individual scent compound and uncovered that only seven  out of total produced compounds in s. latifolia flowers showed behavioral activity in h. bicruris. a further study based on scent composition analysis revealed that veratrole and lilac aldehydes emission is reduced four-folds after pollination, while other behaviorally active and non-active compounds remain unaltered  <cit> . therefore, apart from being involved in pollinator attraction, the decrease in veratrole and lilac aldehyde emission may slow down oviposition and subsequent seed predation by hadena following pollination. phenylacetaldehyde, one of the most abundant behaviorally active compounds, is involved in floral isolation of s. latifolia from the closely related species s. dioica <cit> . these investigations altogether imply that veratrole, lilac aldehydes, and phenylacetaldehyde are key odor compounds that play a central role in pollinator attraction and floral isolation  <cit> . it is presently unclear which compounds induce oviposition by hadena females into female s. latifolia flowers. h. bicruris rarely oviposits into s. dioica <cit> . however, the qualitative difference in floral volatile organic compounds  between s. dioica and s. latifolia involves only few compounds. veratrole, guaiacol, and benzyl benzoate are produced only in s. latifolia but a fatty acid derivative, nonanal is only emitted by s. dioica <cit> . therefore, besides quantitative scent differences  <cit> , three compounds produced in s. latifolia are involved in species differentiation and presumably in maintaining the hadena-silene latifolia relationship.

during the past two decades, molecular research on silene has primarily focused on sex-determination  <cit> , the evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes  <cit> , hybridization  <cit> , and est sequencing for species differentiation or marker development  <cit> . the production of copious amounts of behaviorally active volatile compounds also makes silene an ideal system for investigating genes underlying volatile biosynthesis. at present, though, scent biosynthetic pathways remain uncharacterized in silene. among several scent enzymes known so far, the plant o-methyltransferase  family of enzymes performs a prominent role in secondary metabolism and eliminates a methyl group from s-adenosyl-l-methionine to the hydroxyl group of the substrate  <cit> . besides playing a role in lignin biosynthesis  <cit> , anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> , and disease resistance  <cit> , these omts are also involved in volatile biosynthesis  <cit> . for instance, eugenol o-methyltransferase  and chavicol o-methyltransferase  methylate the substrates in order to synthesize methyleugenol and methylchavicol, respectively  <cit> . studies in roses reported the functional characterization of orcinol o-methyltransferases  genes that are involved in the formation of 3-hydroxy 5-methoxytoluene and  <dig>  5–dimethoxytoluene , two key scent compounds of rose varieties  <cit> . until now, several plant methyltransferases have been functionally characterized owing to their involvement in floral scent biosynthesis and flavoring properties  <cit> .

as part of an ongoing research project to characterize key genes involved in floral scent biosynthesis in silene species, we have recently developed a s. latifolia floral est resource of  <dig>  sequences by constructing one standard and two subtraction cdna libraries . the analysis of these sequences allowed us to characterize a wide range of candidate genes including several omts with high similarities to functionally characterized omts in other species. here we show that two full-length coding cdnas derived from these libraries represent s. latifolia guaiacol o-methyltransferase <dig>  and s. latifolia guaiacol o-methyltransferase <dig>  genes and address the following questions: 1) do heterologously expressed proteins catalyze the formation of veratrole in s. latifolia and s. dioica? 2) how do differences in veratrole emission between day and night in s. latifolia controlled? 3) are slgomt genes differentially expressed between floral and leaf tissues, and between sexes? 4) do slgomt and s. dioica o-methyltransferase  genes show evidence for selection?

RESULTS
isolation and characterization of gomt and gomt-like cdnas
a search of the est database constructed from s. latifolia flowers  for sequences homologous to known o-methyltransferases identified ests, and the sequence information in these ests led to the isolation of two coding cdna sequences of  <dig>  bp that we designated as slgomt <dig> and slgomt <dig>  these sequences encode peptide sequences of  <dig> amino acids and the molecular mass of both purified slgomt proteins was approximately  <dig> kd on sds-page, similar to other plant-based methyltransferases  <cit>  . slgomt <dig> and slgomt <dig> were nearly identical with the exception of two nucleotides differences that result in one amino acid difference at position  <dig>  this weak divergence suggests that the two sequences correspond to different alleles of the same locus. an alignment of the deduced slgomt <dig> and slgomt <dig> protein sequences with other characterized protein sequences is shown in figure  <dig>  the comparison of deduced amino acid sequences between slgomts  and biochemically characterized omts of other plants revealed the 54–55% identity with orcinol omts from rosa hybrida <cit>  and 54% identity with resveratrol omt from vitis <cit> . further blast searches also showed 45% identity with ocimum eugenol omt  <cit>  and 31% identity with solanum catechol omt  <cit> . based on primers designated for slgomt <dig> and slgomt <dig>  we were also able to obtain two gomt-like coding cdnas of  <dig>  bp long from rna extracted from s. dioica flowers and we designated them sdomt <dig> and sdomt <dig>  these both sequences shared 89–90% identity with slgomt <dig> and slgomt <dig>  

biochemical characterization of slgomts and sdomts
slgomts and sdomts were expressed in e. coli and the proteins tested for methylation activity with guaiacol, the presumed substrate of veratrole, as well as orcinol, the substrate of oomt, eugenol, the substrate of eomt, and catechol, a compound recently shown to be the substrate of a methyltransferase in tomato, which converts it to guaiacol  <cit> . methyleugenol, which has no hydroxyl groups that could be methylated, was used as a control . slgomt <dig> exhibited preferred activity with guaiacol and was efficiently able to methylate guaiacol to veratrole , with a km value for guaiacol of  <dig>  μm . slgomt <dig> had low levels of activity with several substrates, including guaiacol  and a km value for guaiacol,  <dig> μm, that is 51-fold higher than that of slgomt <dig> , resulting an enzyme that is 31-fold less efficient with guaiacol than slgomt <dig> . sdomt <dig> and sdomt <dig> did not methylate any of these tested substrates. 

purified slgomt <dig> and slgomt <dig> were assayed at room temperature under standard assay conditions by adding substrate at a final concentration of  <dig> μm and excess 14c-sam together. relative activity is expressed as the percentage of gomt <dig> activity with guaiacol as a substrate.

* specific activity was measured  <dig>  nmol/min/mg protein at saturating substrate concentrations.

veratrole emission
veratrole emission from both female and male flowers was 50– <dig> orders of magnitude higher during the night than during the day . as expected, there was no veratrole emission detected from leaf tissue, indicating that veratrole is a flower-specific compound . however, there was no significant difference in veratrole emission for male and female flowers .

gene expression analysis
to ascertain whether slgomt genes are differentially expressed between flowers and leaves in s. latifolia, qrt-pcr analyses were performed . our results show that slgomt genes are preferentially expressed in floral tissue, whereas no expression was detected in leaf tissues . surprisingly, there was no significant difference found in slgomt gene expression in flowers collected during day and night . however, slgomt expression is significantly  higher in males than in females during day and night .

evolutionary analysis
to analyze evolutionary relationships and patterns of sequence evolution in slgomts and sdomts sequences, we retrieved a total of  <dig> plant omt sequences from ncbi  following the criteria described in the methods section. these sequences were combined with our slgomts and sdomts sequences to construct a bayesian inference phylogeny. all identified silene sequences formed a separate clade and showed distant relationships with m. truncatula isoflavone7-o-methyltransferase  gene. a maximum likelihood-based analysis of synonymous versus non-synonymous mutations was performed to test for the signature of selection. our analysis revealed strong evidence for positive selection  along the branch leading to slgomt <dig> and slgomt <dig>  whereas no evidence for positive selection was found along the branch to sdomt <dig> and sdomt <dig> . purifying selection was found along the branch linking the slgomt and sdomt sequences .

discussion
in this paper, we report the identification of a novel enzyme that is responsible for the formation of veratrole  from guaiacol in silene latifolia. veratrole is widely found among plants and is known as a key compound for some plant-insect interactions. in s. latifolia and other silene species, veratrole is a key compound for pollinator attraction  <cit> . the related  <dig>  4-dimethoxybenzene volatile compound has been identified from the flowers of salix species and this compound serves as an attractant for an oligolectic bee  <cit> . schiestl & dötterl  <cit>  have also recently shown the evolutionary importance of methoxlated aromatics including veratrole in the association of araceae plants and their pollinators, but until our study, the molecular basis of veratrole synthesis was unknown in planta.

gomt and veratrole biosynthesis
the dioecious silene latifolia serves as a plant model system for several ecological and evolutionary topics due to its remarkable features including well differentiated heteromorphic sex chromosomes, its nursery pollination system, and the associated floral fragrances  <cit> . in s. latifolia, aromatic  and montoterpenoid  compounds comprise a significant part of the total floral scent emission  <cit> . genes involved in the synthesis of these few widespread floral volatiles have been characterized in a number of plants, mostly from hermaphroditic species. for instance, genes that are involved in the synthesis of phenylacetaldehyde have been characterized in petunia <cit> , rosa <cit> , lycopersicum <cit> , and arabidopsis <cit> . similarly, a large number of terpene synthase genes have been isolated and characterized in several plant species  <cit> . however, few scent genes have been examined in dioecious species, with one exception being the two terpene synthase genes that are accountable for the synthesis of some sesquiterpenes in actinia deliciosa flowers  <cit> . one of these two terpene synthase genes was found to possess conifer diterpene internal sequence  domain that is usually characteristic feature of many diterpene synthase and determines their activity  <cit> .

veratrole is a key attractant compound in the floral fragrance of s. latifolia and it is down-regulated, together with other compounds, subsequent to pollination  <cit> . our study in this dioecious plant species characterized two candidate "veratrole forming genes", slgomt <dig> and slgomt <dig>  analysis of the activities of the enzymes they encode showed that slgomt <dig> is an efficient and specific guaiacol methyltransferase  whose activity leads to the synthesis of veratrole. slgomt <dig> also had low levels of activity  with several other substrates, with the exception of catechol . slgomt <dig>  on the other hand, has low levels of activity with guaiacol compared to the activity of slgomt <dig> , and comparably low levels with several other substrates tested. therefore, it is not possible to conclude at this point that the presence of slgomt <dig> in the flowers would lead to the synthesis of veratrole, particularly since the km value of slgomt <dig> is relatively high compared with the corresponding value of slgomt <dig> . an examination of the internal concentration of guaiacol in flower tissue is required to resolve this issue.

it has recently been reported that catechol is the substrate of a methyltransferase in tomato fruit  that converts it to guaiacol  <cit> . thus, catechol may serve as a precursor of guaiacol in s. latifolia as well. although slgomt <dig> does show a relatively low level of amino acid similarity to tomato ctomt, we observed a moderate level of activity for slgomt <dig> with catechol . while this result is intriguing, additional work such as measuring catechol concentrations in s. latifolia flowers must be carried out to determine whether catechol is indeed the precursor of guaiacol in this system. in tomato, both catechol and guaiacol have been detected in the fruit, but in s. latifolia flowers, only guaiacol emission, but not catechol, have been observed  <cit> .

it is well established that in many species, flower scent emission is governed by a circadian clock and/or light, apparently as an adaption to the temporal activity of their pollinators  <cit> . our study and that of wälti et al.  <cit>  show that scent emission in s. latifolia differs between day and night. furthermore, slgomt expression in male flowers was 3– <dig> folds higher than in female flowers both during the day and night but this difference was not found for sex-specific veratrole emission. wälti et al.  <cit>  found significant higher veratrole emission in male compared to female s. latifolia plants and the lack of a significant sex specific difference in our study may be consequence of relatively low sample size combined with high variability in veratrole emission. it is worth noting, however, that nieuwenhuizen et al.  <cit>  found that a. deliciosa female flowers produce more scent than male flowers even though no difference in gene expression was found between flowers of the two sexes.

evolution of gomt
the observation that a single amino difference between slgomt <dig> and slgomt <dig> is responsible for a large difference in catalytic efficiency of veratrole synthesis in s. latifolia is intriguing. similarly, two duplicated gene copies were characterized for eugenol synthesis in clarkia breweri in which one copy is about  <dig>  fold more efficient than the other  <cit> .

in contrast to s. latifolia which emits veratrole in its floral odor, s. dioica emits no veratrole  <cit> . the two genes found in that species that are closely related to slgomts, sdomt <dig>  and sdomt <dig>  were found to be expressed in floral tissue, but, our data show that sdomt <dig> and sdomt <dig> do not have activity with guaiacol, catechol, or the other substrates tested in this study. it is possible that these enzymes contain mutations that render them inactive. koeduka et al.  <cit>  found that a single nucleotide substitution in the coding region of the petunia axillaris subsp parodii isoeugenol synthase  gene has resulted to the loss of the enzymatic activity and thereby, prevents isoeugenol emission from flowers. on the other hand, several studies on the plant omt family have revealed that one or a few amino acid changes can be responsible for novel substrate specificities, such as in the clarkia iso omt  <cit>  and ocimum phenylpropene-omts  <cit> . such amino acid changes in omt sequences have been found to evolve under positive selection  <cit> .

because the sequences of slgomt <dig> and slgomt <dig> are more similar to each other than to sdomt <dig> and sdomt <dig> , we do not know if they represent two alleles of the same locus, or a duplication that occurred after the split from s. dioica. the results of the sequence divergence analysis indicate positive selection on slgomt <dig> &slgomt <dig> , suggesting the recent acquisition of gomt activity in s. latifolia by a few amino acid substitutions. this evolutionary change could be brought about through selection for better discrimination by pollinators from its closely related sister species, s. dioica, leading to enhanced floral isolation  <cit> . alternatively, veratrole could be a key signal in the specific association of s. latifolia with its primary pollinator, hadena bicruris. pollinator-mediated selection is commonly occurring on scent compounds  <cit> . higher amount of veratrole emission can empower higher flower attractiveness from longer distances in s. latifolia <cit> . although there is no selection detected on sdomts, the evidence for purifying selection before in the branch leading to both slgomts and sdomts suggest a conserved role of the ancestral omt proteins, and it is therefore possible that the sdomt enzymes have another, as yet uncharacterized functions.

CONCLUSIONS
two novel flower-specific methyltransferase genes were characterized from s. latifolia that are capable of methylating guaiacol and is expressed differentially between male and female individuals. our study also provides the foundation for future silene scent molecular research. altogether, the information provided on genes responsible for scent production and its evolutionary signatures will be relevant for understanding pollinator-driven selection on floral scent variation in plants.
