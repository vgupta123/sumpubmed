BACKGROUND
the gram-negative, halophilic marine bacterium vibrio parahaemolyticus has emerged as a major cause of seafood-associated outbreaks throughout the world and become a significant concern of seafood safety  <cit> . shellfish, particularly oysters, has been frequently implicated in v. parahaemolyticus infections  <cit> . typically within  <dig> h after eating contaminated seafood, v. parahaemolyticus causes acute, self-limiting gastroenteritis characterized by diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills, which lasts for 1- <dig> days  <cit> . two hemolysins, the thermostable direct hemolysin  and the tdh-related hemolysin  are well-characterized virulence factors for pathogenic v. parahaemolyticus strains  <cit> . however, the majority of v. parahaemolyticus strains in the environment and seafood samples lack these two hemolysin genes  <cit> , thus the number of total v. parahaemolyticus has been used as an indicator for preventing v. parahaemolyticus infections from seafood consumption  <cit> .

traditional culture-based methods for isolating and enumerating v. parahaemolyticus from seafood samples involve the most probable number  technique  <cit> . although widely used, such methods are labor-intensive and time-consuming . molecular-based methods such as dna probe hybridization and pcr assays have been developed for v. parahaemolyticus and yielded rapid and specific results  <cit> . however, the probe hybridization procedure and the gel electrophoresis technique used to analyze pcr amplicons are tedious and time-consuming. recently, several real-time pcr assays have been developed for the detection of v. parahaemolyticus with increased speed and sensitivity  <cit> . nonetheless, these assays require a dedicated real-time pcr machine, which is rather expensive and not yet widely available.

loop-mediated isothermal amplification , a novel dna amplification technique invented in  <dig>  <cit> , has since been applied in detecting many bacterial and viral agents  <cit> . because the lamp assay was carried out under isothermal conditions, a simple heater that maintains a constant temperature  is sufficient. lamp assays were reported to be highly specific, sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective  <cit> . very recently, lamp was adopted to detect v. parahaemolyticus and yielded promising results  <cit> . however, in this lamp assay, primers were designed to target the v. parahaemolyticus thermolabile hemolysin gene , and an increasing number of hemolysin gene sequences with various levels of identity to this gene have been described in other vibrios such as vibrio harveyi and vibrio campbellii  <cit> . a search of the genbank also revealed significant homologies among these hemolysin genes http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/blast. additionally, croci et al.  <cit>  evaluated several pcr assays for the identification of v. parahaemolyticus by targeting different genes. among  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus and  <dig> other vibrio spp. strains examined, the two tlh-based pcr protocols  <cit>  obtained 100% inclusivity but had 50% and 91% exclusivity, respectively. in contrast, a toxr-based pcr assay  <cit>  simultaneously evaluated in the same study achieved 100% for both inclusivity and exclusivity  <cit> .

the toxr gene was initially described in v. cholerae as the regulatory gene for the cholera toxin and other virulence determinants  <cit> , and was subsequently found in v. parahaemolyticus  <cit> . although present in many vibrio spp., a membrane "tether" region within the coding sequence of toxr possesses significant heterogeneity and could be used to distinguish various vibrio species  <cit> . the objective of this study was to develop a highly specific and sensitive toxr-based lamp assay for the detection of v. parahaemolyticus in raw oyster samples.

RESULTS
specificity of the lamp assay
the v. parahaemolyticus toxr-based lamp assay run on two platforms by using either a real-time pcr machine or a real-time turbidimeter successfully detected  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus strains while showing negative results for  <dig> non- v. parahaemolyticus strains , indicating that the toxr-based lamp assay was highly specific. on the real-time pcr platform, mean cycle threshold  values for the  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus clinical and environmental strains ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  min, with an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min. the melting temperatures  for these strains consistently fell between  <dig>  and  <dig> °c, with an average mt of  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c. for the  <dig> non- v. parahaemolyticus strains, no ct value was obtained, with melting curve analysis showing no peaks, suggesting no amplification occurred.

sensitivity of the lamp assay
the two pcr assays used to test the same set of v. parahaemolyticus atcc  <dig> templates by using f3/b <dig> and toxr-pcr primers had the same level of sensitivity, approximately  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu per reaction tube , i.e., up to 100-fold less sensitive than the toxr-based lamp assay.

discussion
in this study, we designed a set of five lamp primers to specifically target the v. parahaemolyticus toxr gene, a gene previously shown to possess better specificity for v. parahaemolyticus detection by pcr than other target genes, such as tlh and gyrb  <cit> . we also developed real-time lamp assays using two platforms - a real-time pcr machine and a real-time turbidimeter to quantitatively detect v. parahaemolyticus in pure culture and spiked oyster samples. this is the first report demonstrating the efficacy of a toxr-based lamp assay for detecting v. parahaemolyticus in oysters.

the lamp primers were selected from regions of the v. parahaemolyticus toxr gene coding sequence that are highly specific to v. parahaemolyticus  <cit> . the five primers  targeted seven regions of v. parahaemolyticus toxr , providing additional levels of specificity compared to pcr primers . among a total of  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus and  <dig> non-v. parahaemolyticus strains tested, the toxr-based lamp assay run on both real-time platforms obtained 100% inclusivity and 100% exclusivity. this level of specificity was the same as that of two toxr-based pcr assays evaluated simultaneously in this study and that of a tlh-based lamp assay developed by yamazaki et al.  <cit> . future pairwise comparison of the two lamp assays  using an extensive collection of vibrio strains as done previously for pcr  <cit>  would be desired to further evaluate the performance of the two lamp assays on both inclusivity and exclusivity.

when comparing the sensitivity of lamp with pcr, the toxr-lamp assays were able to detect 47- <dig> v. parahaemolyticus cells per reaction tube, in contrast to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells for toxr-pcr. similarly, the tlh-based lamp assay for v. parahaemolyticus was reported to be 10-fold more sensitive than pcr, with a detection limit of  <dig> cfu per reaction for lamp  <cit> . in a recent report on the detection of pathogenic v. parahaemolyticus by targeting the tdh gene, both lamp and pcr were capable of detecting less than  <dig> cfu of tdh-producing v. parahaemolyticus in a reaction tube, although for different serotypes tested, slight difference in terms of sensitivity was observed  <cit> . additionally, several studies on the detection of other vibrio spp. also found lamp to be 10-fold more sensitive than pcr  <cit> .

running the toxr-lamp assay in a real-time pcr machine consistently achieved a lower limit of detection of  <dig> cells per reaction, whereas in a real-time turbidimeter, a detection limit of  <dig> cells was only occasionally achieved . in addition, the average time to positive results as indicated by ct  for the real-time pcr platform was markedly shorter than that of the real-time turbidimeter platform as indicated by tt , suggesting that the real-time lamp assay based on fluorescence was faster and slightly more sensitive than that based on turbidity. this finding agrees with a previous study which reported that a fluorescent intercalation dye -based real-time lamp was 10-fold more sensitive and faster than a turbidimetry real-time lamp  <cit> . however, in that report, the fluorescence-based lamp assay was found to generate anomalous and irreproducible results in low-concentration templates , which could be due to the effect of the intercalating dye on dna amplification efficiency  <cit> .

in this study, we chose syto- <dig> as the intercalating dye for the real-time pcr platform instead of the commonly used real-time pcr dye sybr green i. based on a previous study  <cit>  comparing the use of these two dyes in real-time pcr, syto- <dig> was found to generate highly reproducible dna melting curves over a broader range of dye concentrations than sybr green i and was far less inhibitory. we also evaluated the use of evagreen  as the intercalating dye on the real-time pcr platform for lamp, but found it to be inhibitory for lamp amplifications .

the strong linear correlation  between the number of v. parahaemolyticus cells in the lamp reaction and the associated ct or tt values over a dynamic range of template concentrations  illustrates the quantitative capability of the toxr-based real-time lamp assays when detecting this organism in both pure culture and spiked oysters. very few reports have examined the quantitative ability of lamp. one study monitoring ammonia-oxidizing bacteria using lamp also reported it to possess good quantitative capability between  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> dna copies  <cit> .

in spiked oyster samples, we found the detection limit of the toxr-based lamp assay to be  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus cells per reaction, which translates to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells per gram of oyster sample. in contrast, the detection limit of the tlh-based lamp in spike shrimp samples was reported to be  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/g   <cit> . the u.s. food and drug administration requires that all postharvest-processed oysters have lower than  <dig> mpn/g of either v. vulnificus or v. parahaemolyticus  <cit> . this indicates that without enrichment, dna amplification assays such as lamp, although potentially quantitative, lack the needed sensitivity when applied to food samples  <cit> . therefore, combining mpn overnight enrichment  <cit>  or pre-enrichment for  <dig> h  <cit>  with lamp or other dna amplification assays is a desirable approach to achieve the needed sensitivity.

when testing spiked oyster samples, we observed the time to positive samples  was delayed several minutes compared to pure culture samples and the detection limit was higher . nonetheless, no extensive sample preparation other than homogenization and two simple centrifugation steps was required. this significantly reduced the total assay time. combined with less than  <dig> h for the real-time lamp assay, the complete lamp detection system was markedly faster than either pcr or conventional methods.

CONCLUSIONS
the toxr-based real-time lamp assay developed in this study was a highly specific, sensitive, and rapid method for the detection of v. parahaemolyticus in oysters. future testing with natural or commercial oyster samples is desired to further evaluate the efficacy of the assay in detecting v. parahaemolyticus in oysters in a field setting.
