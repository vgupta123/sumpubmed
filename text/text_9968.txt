BACKGROUND
paratuberculosis  is caused by mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis  and induces a chronic enteritis in ruminants. the disease signs include weight loss, diarrhea, and decreased milk production. in the united states alone the economic burden of johne's disease is estimated at over $ <dig> million in lost annual revenue to the dairy industry  <cit> . prevalence studies in the united states have estimated that between  <dig> to 30% of dairy herds are infected with m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis  <cit> . neonatal calves are most susceptible to infection and are likely to become infected after ingestion of contaminated milk or colostrum  <cit> . during the subclinical stage of infection, the host cell-mediated immune response is robust and appears to control the infection. as the disease progresses from the subclinical to the clinical stage, the cell-mediated response diminishes, and a humoral immune response predominates  <cit> . vaccines are not completely protective, but have been reported to reduce fecal shedding and delay the onset of clinical disease  <cit> .

lipoproteins have long been considered immunomodulators and mycobacteria are especially rich in these post-translationally modified proteins. there are approximately  <dig> open reading frames identified in the m. tuberculosis genome that possess a characteristic amino-terminal acylation motif  <cit> . the 19-kda lipoprotein from mycobacterium tuberculosis is immunodominant in both mice  <cit>  and humans  <cit>  and has been shown to stimulate cd4+ t cell proliferation as well as the release of il- <dig>  ifn-γ, and il- <dig>  <cit> . acylation near the n-terminal portion of the 19-kda protein is believed to occur at amino acids 19– <dig> and contributes to its immunogenicity  <cit> . furthermore, glycosylation of the m. tuberculosis 19-kda protein inhibits innate immune responses, such as the release of tnf-α, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> from macrophages, but does not affect antibody binding  <cit> . the 19-kda protein was also shown to induce cd8+ cells to secrete ifn-γ and specifically lyse m. tuberculosis-infected monocytes  <cit>  as well as promote neutrophil priming and activation  <cit> . finally, b cell epitopes have been described that localize to the linear sequences of amino acids 11– <dig>  29– <dig>  61– <dig>  and 140– <dig>  as well as a conformation-dependent epitope at the amino and carboxy-terminal ends because of intramolecular disulfide bonding of cysteine residues  <cit> . experimental infection and staining of macrophages has shown that the 19-kda protein is secreted by live m. tuberculosis residing within the phagolysosomal compartment  <cit> . homologues of the 19-kda lipoprotein exist in m. bovis, m. avium, and m. intracellulare but are absent from m. phlei, m. smegmatis, m. fortuitum, m. gordonae, and m. leprae  <cit> .

despite decades of research, little is known about the m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis proteins involved in metabolism, cell wall synthesis, macrophage entry and survival, disease pathogenesis, or host immune evasion. however, several antigens have recently been identified and their immunogenicity examined by serodiagnostic and/or lymphocyte stimulation assays  <cit> . with the genome sequence of m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis recently defined  <cit> , all proteins produced by this pathogen are now identified and can be characterized. novel opportunities arising from the genome sequence of m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis enable us to select and characterize genes of interest. a major goal of this laboratory is to define a complete catalog of immunodominant antigens in m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. with the immunostimulatory capabilities of the m. tuberculosis 19-kda antigen in mind, the objective of this study was to determine if the 19-kda protein of m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis possessed a similar capacity. in this study, the 19-kda lipoprotein from m. avium subspecies paratuberculosis was cloned, expressed, and characterized. in addition, the purified recombinant protein was used to assess cellular immune responses in subclinically infected cattle as well as humoral immune responses in cattle with clinical johne's disease.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of the mycobacterial 19-kda coding region
the 19-kda coding sequence was identified from the m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis genome project as map0261c. comparison of amino acid sequences from other species of mycobacteria show that this gene product is conserved. sequence alignment shows the n-terminal half is more variable and the region between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> is highly conserved . map0261c displays a 95% amino acid identity in m. avium, 84% in m. intracellulare and 76% in m. bovis and m. tuberculosis. map0261c has a g+c content of  <dig> % and encodes for  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. the first  <dig> amino acids of the m. tuberculosis 19-kda protein are hydrophobic and were previously noted to represent a signal peptide that is post-translationally cleaved to expose an n-terminal cysteine  <cit> . signal peptidase cleavage analysis of map0261c  detected a signal peptide generated from a putative cleavage site between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  to expose an n-terminal serine . the signalp-nn  model assigned the highest cleavage probability values to amino acid  <dig>  with the predicted length of the signal peptide being  <dig> amino acids. this is slightly longer than most signal sequences which range from  <dig> to about  <dig> amino acid residues in length  <cit> . the predicted peptidase cleavage sight for m. tuberculosis is between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> and therefore falls within this range . despite a predicted signal peptidase cleavage site, psortb analysis software  could not predict if the protein was cytoplasmic or membrane located.

cloning and expression of the m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis 19-kda protein
in order to perform immunoassays with purified 19-kda protein, map0261c was amplified from m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis genomic dna and cloned into the pmal-c <dig> expression vector and transformed in e. coli. induced expression resulted in production of a maltose binding protein - <dig> kda fusion protein that was affinity-purified from e. coli lysates. mbp- <dig> kda was analyzed by sds-page  to assess yield, purity and size. the predicted mass of mbp alone is  <dig> kda, while the predicted mass of the mbp- <dig> kda fusion protein is  <dig> kda. the purified mbp- <dig> kda protein migrated to a position around  <dig> kda in sds-page . approximately  <dig> mg of purified protein was easily obtained from a 500-ml broth culture at o.d. <dig> nm =  <dig> . the purified protein was further characterized by immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody  that detects the mbp affinity tag . both the fusion protein and mbp alone are detected by the mab. in addition, the fusion protein is expressed at higher levels under inducing conditions.

immunoblot analysis of the 19-kda protein
the m. tuberculosis 19-kda protein is known to be immunodominant, therefore immunoblot analysis was performed to determine if cattle naturally infected with m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis produce antibodies against the 19-kda protein. immunoblots were probed with sera from  <dig> non-infected and  <dig> clinically infected cattle. sera from  <dig> of  <dig> non-infected cattle did not react with either mbp or mbp- <dig> kda, while  <dig> non-infected cattle weakly recognized both mbp and mbp- <dig> kda protein . by comparison, sera from  <dig> of  <dig> infected cattle reacted specifically with the 19-kda protein, but not mbp alone. antibody reactivity to the 19-kda protein from  <dig> clinical cows is shown in figure  <dig>  sera from the remaining five infected cattle detected both mbp and mbp- <dig> kda proteins. this result made it difficult to distinguish if sera from the animal recognized the map0261c gene product or if it simply recognized the mbp affinity tag. collectively, these data suggest that the 19-kda protein is detectable and immunogenic in cattle with johne's disease.

ifn-γ responses of infected cattle
as an indicator of the cell-mediated responses of infected cattle to the 19-kda protein, whole blood containing pbmcs from  <dig> control and  <dig> infected cows was stimulated with m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis sonicated whole cell lysate , mbp, or mbp- <dig> kda and ifn-γ production was assayed by elisa. these cattle were selected from a larger group because they showed no ifn-γ stimulation in response to mbp alone. ifn-γ production in response to wcl stimulation allowed for the segregation of infected cattle into three groups: suspect, positive, and high positive. after subtracting the ifn-γ responses of non-stimulated cells, suspect animals had less than  <dig>  absorbance units of ifn-γ production, positive animals had  <dig>  –  <dig>  absorbance units of ifn-γ production, and high positive animals had more than  <dig>  absorbance units of ifn-γ production. ifn-γ responses by blood mononuclear cells from infected cattle exceeded responses from control cattle for both the wcl and mbp- <dig> kda  were found between control and high positive groups for both wcl and mbp- <dig> kda protein stimulation. however, direct comparisons of the two antigen preps using mononuclear cells from the same animal clearly showed the wcl was a stronger stimulator of ifn-γ production .

discussion
a majority of the research on individual mycobacterial proteins has been performed in m. tuberculosis, whereas little is known about the m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis proteome. indeed, all currently available antigen-based diagnostic tests for johne's disease use an undefined mixture of proteins, such as purified protein derivative  or wcl, which may not be specific for m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. recent completion of the m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis genome has already advanced efforts to identify novel antigens  <cit> . furthermore, the genome will be a critical resource in proteomic studies directed at defining the proteins present in mixtures such as johnin ppd. the present study was performed in order to characterize the m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis 19-kda protein, as well as assess its immunostimulatory capabilities in cattle.

in this study, we show that the 19-kda protein of m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis can be readily overexpressed as a fusion protein in e. coli. this is not true for many other proteins encoded by m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis  <cit>  and suggests the putative lipoprotein is not toxic to e. coli. previous studies have suggested the m. tuberculosis 19-kda protein undergoes posttranslational modification by the addition of fatty acids to form a lipoprotein  <cit> . although not demonstrated directly by our studies, it is possible that the 19-kda was not posttranslationally modified by the heterologous e. coli host. it is unclear whether posttranslational modification of this protein would affect its immunological activity. the recombinant antigen was detected by sera from cattle with johne's disease; however, it was not as strong a stimulator of proliferative t-cell responses as has been reported for its counterpart in m. tuberculosis  <cit> . furthermore, the 19-kda protein from m. tuberculosis was shown to induce both cellular and humoral immune responses from mice and humans  <cit> . these studies, combined with the present study, may suggest that acylation is more important in cell-mediated immune responses than in the humoral immune response.

it is generally accepted that cellular and humoral immune responses of m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected cattle are biphasic, with ifn-γ responses detected early and antibody responses detected late in infection. however, evidence suggests that an unknown m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis protein can be detected by antibodies from cattle just  <dig> weeks after infection  <cit> . as a measure of cellular immune responses, blood mononuclear cells from infected cattle were stimulated with both the recombinant 19-kda protein and a whole-cell sonicated lysate of m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis , and ifn-γ production was measured. results from this study suggest that while the 19-kda protein is a stimulator of ifn-γ production, it is not as potent when compared to wcl. additionally, we found that a majority  of infected cattle produced antibodies to the 19-kda protein, as determined by immunoblot analysis. by comparison, sera from the majority of control, non-infected cattle  did not react to the 19-kda protein. the single non-infected cow that did show reactivity to the map0261c gene product may be attributed to exposure of environmental mycobacteria such as m. avium subsp. avium, which has a similar protein . sera from four clinical cows reacted to the mbp protein, but this reactivity was extremely weak. mbp is found in environmental e. coli and likely accounts for reactivity seen in some cattle. in order to avoid potential cross-reactivity with mbp, we attempted to cleave the mbp portion from the mbp- <dig> kda fusion protein, but cleavage was not 100% efficient .

the m. tuberculosis 19-kda protein was reported to contain a  <dig> amino acid n-terminal signal peptide  <cit> , however our signalp analysis for m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis identified a putative  <dig> amino acid n-terminal signal sequence. furthermore, the computer algorithm psortb predicts a putative signal sequence, but it cannot determine if the protein is actually secreted. antibodies will be produced against the recombinant mbp- <dig> kda protein to determine if the protein is secreted by m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis.

CONCLUSIONS
the results from this study show that the recombinant 19-kda protein stimulates a weak host immune response in infected cattle. the 19-kda protein may be used in conjunction with other antigens from m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis to identify infected cattle but should not be used as a "stand alone antigen" in new diagnostic assays.
