BACKGROUND
a major challenge in structural bioinformatics is the prediction of protein structure and function from primary amino acid sequences. this problem is becoming more pressing now as the protein sequence-structure gap is widening rapidly as a result of the completion of large-scale genome sequencing projects  <cit> . as an intermediate but useful step, predicting a number of key properties of proteins including secondary structure, solvent accessibility, contact numbers and contact order is a possible and promising strategy, which simplifies the prediction task by projecting the three-dimensional structures onto one dimension, i.e. strings of residue-wise structural assignments  <cit> .

however, the current state-of-art methods can only achieve a prediction accuracy of 76%-80%, for the three-state secondary structure prediction  <cit> . one of the main reasons for the limitation to accurate secondary structure prediction is attributed to the long-range residue contacts , which is often overlooked or under-represented in the current prediction methods. kihara examined the relationship between residue contact order and the prediction accuracy and found that there exists a negative correlation for the α-helices and β-strands  <cit> . their studies indicated that long-range residue contacts have significant effects on the secondary structure prediction. therefore, it is worthwhile incorporating these two-dimensional contact maps of residue contact orders in order to further improve the prediction performance. moreover, in addition to its significance to secondary structure prediction, residue contact order also has an important implication in protein folding rate prediction  <cit> . previous studies have well established that residue contact order has a strong correlation with folding rate and, more recently, punta and rost demonstrated that the two-state folding rates of a protein can be reliably estimated by predicting its residue-residue contacts even for the proteins of unknown structures  <cit> .

residue-wise contact order  is a new kind of one-dimensional protein structure representing the extent of long-range contacts, which is a sum of sequence separations between the given residue and all the other contacting residues  <cit> . relative contact order  was originally put forward by plaxco et al. to describe the complexity of protein topology and is often used to study the correlation between protein topology and folding rate  <cit> . based on this definition, kihara further defined the residue contact order , which was the average contact order of the residue of interest  <cit> . recently, kinjo et al. put forward a similar definition and introduced the concept of rwco  <cit> , which can be considered as a generalization of rco. in other words, rwco is the sum of the sequence separation of contacting residues, that is, for residue i, rwcoi = n × rcoi, where n is the number of contacting residues with residue i  <cit> . as discussed by kinjo et al., co is a per-protein quantity based on the whole protein level, while rwco and rco are per-residue properties based on the residue level. recent studies have indicated that it is applicable to use rwco, together with contact numbers and secondary structures to accurately recover the three-dimensional structures of a protein  <cit> . therefore, accurate prediction of rwco values in proteins would have many important applications, especially in protein structure prediction and protein folding rate prediction, as well as helping to determine protein homologous folds.

several methods have been developed so far to predict the rwco distributions from the primary amino acid sequences. kinjo et al. proposed a simple linear regression method to predict rwco values and the local sequence information with multiple sequence alignments in the form of psi-blast profiles was extracted using a sliding window scheme centered on the target residue. their method achieved a highest correlation coefficient  of  <dig>  between the native  and predicted rwco values using an unusual half window size of  <dig> . and the corresponding root mean square error  was  <dig> . this result was averaged on the test datasets by 15-fold cross-validation. they claimed that this long-range correlation reflected by the unusually long window size was a conspicuous property of rwco, which was distinctly different from any other one-dimensional structure prediction  <cit> . later they developed another method called critical random network  to refine this task using the same extra-large window size of  <dig> residues, and their accuracy was further improved to a cc of  <dig>  and rmse of  <dig>   <cit> .

in the present study, we proposed a novel method to predict the rwco profiles from amino acid sequences based on support vector regression . different from the linear regression approach, our method uses the non-linear radial basis kernel function  to approximate and determine the sequence-rwco relationship. we extensively explored seven different sequence encoding schemes and examined their different effects on the prediction performance. the results showed that introducing the predicted secondary structure by psipred program, in conjunction with the global information such as protein molecular weight and amino acid compositions, could significantly enhance the prediction performance. our method could predict rwco values with a pearson's correlation coefficient  of  <dig>  and root mean square error  of  <dig> . we compared our prediction accuracy with that of kinjo et al. using the same 15-fold cross-validation based on the same training and testing datasets. our results show that our approach is superior to the linear regression method and slightly better than the critical random network method in predicting protein structural profile values and describing sequence-structure relationships.

RESULTS
rwco distribution at four different radius thresholds
the rwco value for each residue in the dataset was computed by defining four different sphere radii rd centered on the cβ atom of the target residue, i.e. rd = 8Å, 10Å, 12Å and 14Å. for each given radius cutoff rd, we computed the average rwco distributions over the whole dataset using formula  and , which are displayed in figure  <dig>  the corresponding mean  and standard deviation  are listed in table  <dig>  there are significant correlations between the four different rwco distributions. the rwco values defined by four different radii cutoffs have correlation coefficients  all greater than  <dig>  . it can be seen that rwco distributions with large radius cutoffs  are close to gamma distributions  and even after the normalization step using equation , their normalized rwco distribution profiles retain the same tendency. since previous studies also indicated that larger radii rd = 12Å and 14Å have more significant meaning in protein fold recognition  <cit>  and because the directly related work  <cit>  also used a large radius cutoff of 12Å, we set rd = 12Å in the following analysis in order to be consistent with the previous work and make an objective comparison.

n¯
relationship between accessible surface area and rwco
since rwco is a per-residue quantity of amino acid  <cit> , it is natural to conjecture that there exists a relationship between rwco and the solvent accessibility profile of amino acid residue. in order to investigate their connections, we extracted the accessible surface area  values of each residue in our dataset using the dssp program  <cit> . the negative relationship between rwco and asa could be observed with a correlation coefficient of - <dig>  . this means that the larger the asa of a residue, the smaller the rwco value of that residue, which is consistent with the expectation that the residue with small asa has large numbers of contact residues in the structure space around itself.

predicting rwco values using multiple sequence alignment profiles
as many studies have indicated, the evolutionary information implicitly contained in the multiple sequence alignments could provide better prediction performance compared with the single sequence alone. in this study, the position-specific scoring matrix  generated by the psi-blast program  <cit>  served as the input to svr. the important evolutionary information is stored in these multiple sequence alignment profiles. for an objective comparison with the results of kinjo et al.  <cit> , we also performed the same 15-fold cross-validation test in this study, i.e.  <dig> proteins were randomly divided into two parts: the training dataset with  <dig> proteins and the testing dataset with the remaining  <dig> proteins  <cit> . this procedure was repeated  <dig> times, generating the final  <dig> combinations of svr training and testing datasets. at each cross-validation step, we built the svr model using the normalized training set, predicted the normalized rwco values using this model and then transformed to their absolute rwco values. four prediction performance measures the correlation coefficient , root mean square error devap, rmse_norm and rmse_raw are given in table  <dig> .

in the current work, rwco is normalized using the entire benchmark dataset. more specifically, rwco is normalized according to the formula  in the methods section using the standard deviation and mean raw rwco values that are computed based on the whole dataset. we first computed the normalized rwco values before svr training and testing, then replaced the raw rwco values by using these normalized values . after predicting the normalized rwco values for the test datasets, we restored the raw rwco values by transforming the predicted normalized rwco values to raw ones by using equation . the reason for using normalized rwco values instead of the raw values here is that this strategy can improve the prediction performance and is more robust than if raw values are used. as suggested by the reviewer, we tested the predictive performance of the same sequence encoding scheme "ls+w+aa+ss" based on both the normalized values and raw ones, whose result comparison is shown in table  <dig>  it is clear that the predictor using normalized rwco values is superior to that of using raw values- the cc improves from  <dig>  to  <dig> , whereas the values of devap and rmse_raw drop from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and from  <dig>  to  <dig> , respectively. this normalization step is important for achieving better prediction performance in the training and testing svr process.

it can be seen that the use of multiple sequence alignments for svr training and testing yields cc =  <dig> , devap =  <dig>  and rmse_raw =  <dig>  , which is already a statistically significant result. although lower than other sequence encoding schemes with a cc less by about  <dig> , using multiple sequence alignment in the form of psi-blast profiles as input to svr can still achieve a comparable prediction performance compared with other more complicated schemes. thus implying that multiple sequence profiles contain essential information for accurately predicting rwco values. this finding is also consistent with other studies such as predicting solvent accessibility  <cit> , b factor profiles  <cit> , contact numbers  <cit>  and disulfide connectivity  <cit> .

for a better understanding of the cc and rmse measures used here, we provided two prediction examples of well-predicted and badly-predicted proteins in figure  <dig>  this figure shows to what extent the predicted and observed rwco values match each other. protein integrin alpha-l  is well predicted with a cc of  <dig>  and a rmse of  <dig> . the majority of the regions of this protein are in good agreement with its corresponding observed values, except several separate positions at the tail end. in contrast, the transcriptional activator gcn <dig>  is poorly predicted with a cc of only  <dig>  and an rmse of  <dig> .

improving the prediction performance by incorporating global information such as protein molecular weight and amino acid composition, as well as the predicted secondary structure by psipred
the multiple sequence alignment profile used here is a kind of local sequence feature. however, we still need to take into account additional global features to further improve the prediction performance. kinjo et al. also pointed out that the global context has an effect on the prediction accuracy and it might be useful to include more global features of amino acid sequences  <cit> . on the other hand, protein molecular weight, as another global sequence feature, could considerably improve the prediction accuracy  <cit> . we thus divided the protein sequences into four subgroups with equal protein numbers according to their molecular weights. we also incorporated the amino acid composition as the input vector to svr.

in this work, we employed seven different encoding schemes, i.e. local sequence , local sequence plus molecular weight , local sequence plus amino acid composition , local sequence plus predicted secondary structure information by psipred , local sequence together with molecular weight and amino acid composition , local sequence together with molecular weight and predicted secondary structure , local sequence, molecular weight, amino acid composition and predicted secondary structure information . psipred is a program to generate the probability profiles for three secondary structure state  assignments for each residue of the predicted protein  <cit> . we extracted the  <dig> ×  <dig> =  <dig> matrix from the output file of psipred by selecting the sliding window size  <dig>  and incorporated this matrix into the svr model. for the last sequence encoding scheme "ls+w+aa+ss", a residue was encoded as a  <dig> × 20+1+20+ <dig> ×  <dig> =  <dig> dimensional vector. the prediction results for each subgroup are shown in table  <dig> 

as a kind of global feature using either the amino acid composition  or protein molecular weight  yields the better prediction performance compared with local sequence alone. however, in contrast to amino acid composition, it is worth noting that protein molecular weight here can give a more significant improvement. the significance of molecular weight on the prediction performance has been previously observed in the prediction study of protein contact numbers  <cit> . this effect is even remarkable when predicting proteins with relatively small molecular weights. for instance, for proteins with weights less than  <dig> daltons, "ls+aa" schemes can give prediction accuracy with a cc of  <dig> , devap of  <dig>  and rmse_raw of  <dig> , while "ls+w" can increase the cc to  <dig>  and decrease devap and rmse_raw to  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. furthermore, when combining the amino acid and molecular weight information, there is still a significant improvement in the final prediction performance. the encoding scheme "ls+w+aa" could predict rwco values with an overall cc of  <dig> , devap of  <dig>  and rmse_raw of  <dig> .

proteins with relatively large molecular weights are less well predicted than proteins with smaller molecular weights. for example, for proteins with molecular weights larger than  <dig> daltons, the "ls" encoding scheme could only predict their rwco values with a cc of  <dig> , devap of  <dig>  and rmse_raw of  <dig> , which is rather lower than for the other protein groups. even after adopting the "ls+w+aa+ss" encoding scheme, the resulting improvement is still not as significant as other protein groups, i.e. with a cc of  <dig> , devap of  <dig>  and rmse_raw of  <dig> . this might be attributable to the small numbers of large proteins in the current datasets which are under-represented when building svr models, while the availability of the training samples could in turn affect the predictive ability of built svm models to a large extent.

when compared with the global features such as amino acid composition  and protein molecular weight , however, the predicted secondary structure by psipred seems to be the most important determinant of our predictors. this is apparent by observing the significant performance improvement that the cc increases from  <dig>  using the "ls" encoding scheme to  <dig>  using the "ls+ss" scheme, whereas the values of devap, rmse_norm and rmse_raw decreases from  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. we can also draw the same conclusion by comparing the performance improvement of the "ls+w" encoding scheme with that of the "ls+w+ss" scheme. the cc improves from  <dig>  to  <dig> , while the devap and rmse_raw values decrease from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig> , respectively, after incorporating "ss" information in the encoding scheme "ls+w". as a result, our method achieved the overall best prediction accuracy after adopting the encoding scheme "ls+w+aa+ss", i.e. combing all the four kinds of information. the average cc, devap and rmse_raw scores are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

to visualize the prediction accuracy of individual protein, we plotted the cc against the corresponding protein molecular weight in figure  <dig>  it can be shown that most proteins tested are situated in the region with ccs larger than  <dig>  or more, while there also exist some separate proteins which are poorly predicted with ccs lower than  <dig> . these proteins that are poorly predicted are found to be mainly distributed on both sides of protein weights, suggesting that both some small and large proteins are less accurately predicted.

we also calculated the overall distributions of cc, devap and rmse of the testing proteins sequences for the seven different encoding schemes, which are depicted in figure  <dig>  the peak values of cc, devap and rmse are close to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. for the cc distribution, the rightmost curve in the plot represents the best prediction method, while for devap and rmse distributions, the leftmost curves denote the best method. all the three distributions of cc, devap and rmse indicated that the "ls+w+aa+ss" encoding scheme leads to the best performance.

the mean absolute errors  of residues with different rwco values are plotted in figure  <dig>  it can be seen that the "ls+w+aa+ss" encoding scheme leads to the least mean absolute error for the majority of the regions and thus could give the best prediction performance. residues with rwco value  <dig> are predicted with the least mean absolute errors, due to the fact that these proteins have the largest numbers in the current dataset and thus are adequately represented. on the other hand, residues with larger rwco values  have larger maes and are thus worst predicted.

comparison with other methods
we also compared our svr based method with other prediction methods, such as the linear regression method  <cit>  and critical random networks   <cit> . for an objective comparison, these methods are all measured on the same training and testing datasets using 15-fold cross-validation. the results are summarized in table  <dig> 

-the result can not be obtained from the relevant papers.

when selecting the sequence encoding scheme "ls+w+aa+ss", the svr method could achieve the best prediction accuracy with a cc of  <dig> , devap of  <dig> , and rmse_raw of  <dig> . the linear regression method is based on the simple linear regression scheme and achieved prediction accuracy with a cc of  <dig>  and devap of  <dig>   <cit> . crn predicted rwco values by defining a linear function of a state vector associated with a target sequence, namely, the position-specific scoring matrices  generated from psi-blast and achieved a best prediction performance with cc of  <dig>  and devap of  <dig>   <cit> . both linear regression and crn methods employed the same local window size of  <dig> residues to achieve their respective best performance. as can be seen, the svr method performed much better than the simple linear regression method and slightly better than that of the crn method with the same accuracy of cc and smaller devap values. these results suggest that the svr method is at least competitive with, if not better than, the previously developed methods.

discussion
residue-wise contact order, in conjunction with secondary structure, solvent accessibility, b factors and contact number, can provide complementary and indispensable information for the ultimate prediction of protein three-dimensional structures. due to the importance of residue contact orders on the protein folding and protein structure prediction, studies in this direction are receiving more and more attention recently  <cit> .

several ways may help to further improve the prediction performance in the future. the first approach is to use more accurately determined pdb structures with better resolutions. the second is to incorporate other informative and complementary features, such as protein solvent accessibility and contact numbers, which have been proved to have high correlations with rwco values in proteins  <cit> . the third strategy can focus on how to effectively represent those under-represented proteins with lower or higher molecular weights. increasing the ratio of these proteins in the whole dataset could also contribute to enhancing the prediction accuracy. further improvement is possibly achieved by using refined datasets and combining more informative multiple feature descriptors together.

as a new machine learning method, support vector regression has many attractive features and our study presented here has further enhanced its useful application in reliably predicting residue-wise contact orders in proteins. the present method may also be useful in protein structure prediction, protein folding rate prediction and protein engineering applications.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we have developed a novel approach to predict the residue-wise contact order in proteins using support vector regression based on the local protein sequence descriptor  and two global descriptors . the predicted secondary structure by psipred also served as input to the svr. for completeness, we introduced seven different sequence encoding combinations and investigated their effects on the prediction performance. we found that using the local sequence descriptor could provide benchmark prediction accuracy with a cc of  <dig> , devap of  <dig>  and rmse of  <dig> . furthermore, after adopting the sequence encoding scheme "ls+w+aa+ss" that combined the local sequence descriptor, global descriptors and the predicted secondary structure together, our method could yield the best prediction performance with a cc of  <dig> , devap of  <dig>  and rmse of  <dig> , a significant improvement over the accuracy based on local sequence information alone. our results indicated that both the local sequence context and the predicted secondary structure are important determinants in predicting residue-wise contact orders in proteins. we have demonstrated that the svr approach is competitive with other existing algorithms based on linear regression models. due to its attractive potential in condensing information and regressing value profiles, it is anticipated that the svr method will play a more important role in analyzing large-scale genome and proteome data as more biological data becomes available through genome sequencing projects.
