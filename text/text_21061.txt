BACKGROUND
cytokines comprise an extensive array of extracellular protein mediators best known for their traditional immunoregulatory functions, although their multiple roles in the orchestration of an array of physiological and pathological processes such as cancer, autoimmunity and cardiovascular disease are now well-recognized . many former reductionist studies have attempted to ascribe given physiological effects to the actions of one or small numbers of cytokines, but this strategy has met with conceptual difficulties stemming from the fact that their actions can be paradoxical at different concentrations and differ according to the prevailing hormonal milieu  <cit> . furthermore, the mechanistic insight offered by such studies in terms of relative cytokine interactions is also limited given that physiological responses are seldom governed by any one cytokine but rather by the combined influences of many. in this respect, these mediators are believed to operate as part of highly complex networks, wherein they exhibit antagonism, synergy and functional redundancy . it is therefore clear that gaining a fuller understanding of cytokine function in any biological or clinical scenario rests with clarifying their interactions at a network level rather than relying on the increasingly inadequate t helper cell type 1/ <dig>  paradigm  <cit> .

recent developments in high-throughput analytical platforms have revolutionized the quality and quantity of data available from in vivo experiments. the large number of analytes measurable in single samples provides the opportunity to explore their interrelationships in both physiological and pathophysiological processes  <cit> . in this regard, bayesian networks provide an attractive methodology for analyzing such complex biological data . given that many biologists are unlikely to be familiar with probabilistic graphical models, a word of introduction to bayesian networks is warranted. a bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph whose nodes are the variables of interest , each of which can have a range of quantitative values which are typically discretized into a small number of bins, such as ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’. the directed edges in the graph  reflect likely causal relationships between nodes. the nature of these causal relationships is captured by the graph’s underlying conditional probability table  which details the probabilities for any given node to fall into each of the different  bins given the status of its parent nodes . the underlying cpt does not change upon perturbation; rather the marginal probability of that node displaying a certain behavior changes . the illustrative bayesian network shown in fig.  <dig> has five variables . node e is not causally influenced by any of the others, nor does it causally influence them, so this node has no edges entering or leaving it . by contrast, nodes b and c are solely influenced by a, so each has a single connecting edge. however, they respond to a in quite different ways. based on the conditional probability tables, if the value of a is categorized into a low concentration bin, then b has a marginal probability of  <dig>  of falling into a high concentration bin, while c has a probability of  <dig>  of falling into a low one. the status of d is influenced by both b and c and accordingly has two incoming edges. this approach offers the scope for an intricate description of d’s behavior, based on the conditional probabilities associated with the allocation of its data to high or low concentration bins which, in turn, depends on the state of a, b and c. the conditional probability tables for each node represent relative  concentrations.fig.  <dig> illustrative bayesian network describing causal relationships between five variables, with their associated conditional probability tables. the values of each variable have been discretized into low , medium  and high  bins. the notation p refers to the probability of b being in the low value bin, conditional upon the value of a . note that with one parent only , both row and column probabilities sum to  <dig>  whereas with multiple inputs , only the rows sum to  <dig>  the nodes are colored green , white  and red  to illustrate in silico perturbation where a falls into a high concentration bin  and e falls into a low concentration bin . the implications of this are demonstrated through the conditional probability tables associated with each downstream node wherein having d in a given concentration state is dictated by the particular combination of states of its parents b and c as dictated by their corresponding overall  probabilities , as summarized in the histogram attached to each node. note that the overall marginal probability of d being in a particular state  is the sum as summarized in the histogram attached to each node. readers more familiar with bayesian networks will note that the sub-network structures  and  are both markov equivalent with the present one . when we condition on a, the other nodes b and c become independent no matter whether a is a tail-to-head or tail-to-tail intermediate node . in other words, these three sub-networks specify the same independent assumptions belonging to the same equivalence class and the true causal network can possibly be any one of the sub-network solutions. however, causal networks based on observation alone  can be still partially constructed. in the present study, prior knowledge seed network edge directionalities were assigned by a modified depth-first search algorithm which helped to choose the sub-network from an equivalence class containing more than one markov equivalent member as suggested here 



a bayesian network can be inferred from experimental data through the correlations between experimentally-measured quantitative values of different nodes. various machine learning techniques are used to undertake this inference process, which is often helped by the use of a prior-knowledge graph ‘seed’ incorporating well-recognized, literature-derived information which reduces the computational outlay required to learn networks from biological data. such prior knowledge speeds up the search and avoids local minima, improving performance and yielding statistically more robust networks, as described in djebbari and quackenbush   <cit> . moreover, this bias does not limit the process to learn new interactions between the nodes. accordingly, bayesian networks are well adapted to noisy data, small sample sizes and, most importantly, a lack of detailed knowledge about how causal interactions are implemented at a biological level. moreover, they also allow the effect of network perturbations to be explored in silico  <cit> . indeed, once the network structure is established, the impact of in silico perturbation of upstream nodes  can be tracked through the network structure to assess the changes in the conditional probabilities of the downstream nodes, thereby leading to specific, experimentally verifiable predictions. it is nonetheless possible to conceive more complex biological relationships which cannot be distilled into a bayesian acyclic graph. in this respect, bayesian networks are acyclic insofar as they do not allow for the portrayal of structural causal loops such as those which may arise from feedback relationships  <cit> . however, they offer a sensible compromise between capturing complex causal relationships and computational feasibility, and have thus been used in a wide variety of scientific contexts .

while most bayesian-based studies have focused on core biological processes using data from cell lines or tissue-based genome-wide expression microarrays, less attention has been paid to physiological or clinically relevant in vivo systemically-derived data  <cit> . as such, bayesian methodologies offer a valuable opportunity to define the nature of both known and novel mediator interrelationships in complex physiological processes such as immunity and inflammation. they are, however, correlative and their significance rests on the ability to draw causal inferences about the underlying biology from these relationships.

in order to validate the models learned through this methodology, both from a biological as much as from an analytical perspective, we developed two independent circulatory cytokine and hormone-based datasets: one drawn from lactating mice and the other from mice whose pups were removed at birth. with regard to the former network, murine lactation represents a unique model system to explore the dynamic physiological interactions between the hormonal environment and inflammation/immune function, with particular regard to the effects of prolactin , both a key driver of lactation and putative critical immunomodulator . since lactation prl levels can conveniently be abrogated in vivo by removal of the suckling stimulus, this offers an excellent strategy to verify predictions made by in silico perturbation of the lactation network by comparing it with an independently-generated in vivo pup-free network with a physiologically-induced prl abolition. these networks were further used to infer functionally significant nodes, such as ‘hubs’ and ‘drivers’, as well as characterizing the relationships between nodes, such as synergy and antagonism. to the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous attempts to employ bayesian network analysis to unravel dynamic protein interactions based on physiological in vivo data in such a mechanistic and qualitatively validated manner .

RESULTS
we chose to characterize the physiological putative changes in, and interactions between, systemic hormone and cytokine concentrations using murine lactation as a model, since this system offered the benefit of featuring both intimate and highly variable physiological immunoendocrine interactions . the benefits of this approach included not having to use multiple pharmacological agents/antibodies whose effects would require titrating to concentration , and not being subject to non-physiological interactions or inducing global changes unrelated to the system of interest. similarly, our approach deliberately aimed to avoid using multiple knockout models on both pragmatic and functional grounds given the compensatory redundancy of cytokine networks and/or the unknown postpartum traits of such models. our design was based on two independent data sets: one covering cytokine and hormonal profiles over  <dig> time points throughout lactation in order to generate a bayesian model of mediator interactions, and another abrogated lactation data set which provided a biological validation platform for assessing the predictive power of the former network in determining the physiological profile changes elicited by pup removal. the methodological workflow is described in fig. 2; please see the methods section for experimental details.fig.  <dig> experimental methodology utilized in the present study; initial biological analysis  was followed by development and exploration of bayesian networks. in vivo physiological perturbation was performed to validate the in silico networks.

cytokine and hormone profiles during lactation cluster into three distinct time-series
in order to reveal the temporal structure in the data, we examined correlations between analytes and clustered the time series. significant correlations were noted across the array of mediators investigated, except for e <dig>  il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig> , p <dig> and prl . these relationships were used to inform the cluster analysis  which revealed that analyte profiles fell into three clusters: cluster  <dig>  peaked around day  <dig>  and tailed off steadily thereafter. cluster  <dig> , il- <dig> , il- <dig>  mip-1β, rantes) started off low and increased steadily to plateau from day  <dig> onwards, while cluster  <dig>  behaved similarly but had a broad peak centered on day  <dig> of lactation.fig.  <dig> correlations between cytokine and hormone mediators; panel a heat map demonstrating the correlations between cytokines, e <dig>  p <dig> and prl. red coloring indicates positive correlations, while blue coloring indicates negative correlations. the strength of color reflects the strength of correlation  – numbers in brackets refer to cluster identities. panel b clusters indicating relationships between mediators. three clusters were identified: cluster  <dig> - il- <dig>  e <dig>  p <dig>  prl; cluster  <dig> - il-1α, il-1β, il- <dig> , il- <dig> , il- <dig>  mip-1β, rantes; and cluster  <dig> - eotaxin, g-csf, gm-csf, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifn-γ, kc, mcp- <dig>  mip-1α, tnf-α



development of bayesian networks
generation of the lactation prior network
in the search for a network graph, an initial prior network structure seed was used as a bias, and the final network was learned from the data. the space of possible networks was explored using the tabusearch algorithm and, at each iteration, the score was evaluated by adding, removing or reversing individual edges. the introduction of a prior network seed initiated the learning stage from all  <dig> data samples for  <dig> nodes as soft bias wherein the original seed edges were judged by the score in the same way as any other network edge. for each node, all prior probabilities  exceeded zero, enabling the construction of bayesian networks reflecting all possible nodal interactions. initiating the parameters  for each node at the beginning was achieved using a uniform distribution; and these changed with the data. details of the prior network  revealed that this featured  <dig> nodes,  <dig> of which appeared as parents.

the lactation bayesian network structure features six structural hubs
a bayesian network from the lactation dataset was generated incorporating a prior knowledge network  with experimental data, wherein node  interactions were portrayed as directed edges implying likely causal relationships. each node was associated with a set of conditional probabilities which determined its status  dependent upon the status of its parents. this network organized into two main branches, one with il- <dig>  e <dig> and eotaxin as the first-line parents and the other with il- <dig>  as the principal parent node . the network itself was assembled around six structural hubs  comprising ifn-γ, il- <dig>  mcp- <dig>  mip-1α, mip-1β, and rantes. the terminal node was tnf-α, which was connected - both directly and indirectly - to each of these hubs. a total of  <dig> directed edges  representing cytokine causal relationships connected all but one node: only il- <dig> was orphaned. e <dig>  p <dig>  and prl had a high probability of being present at elevated concentration relative to all other network components, with the exception of eotaxin and il- <dig> .fig.  <dig> bayesian network showing cytokine interrelationships in murine lactation. the nodes are color-coded according to the conditional probability of corresponding mediator relative concentrations being high , low  or medium  concentration given the state of their parent nodes; however, within the present network no nodes fell into the medium category. relative to the white color, the normalized concentration  determines the intensity of the node color. very high confidence level edges  are colored in green , based upon the confidence analysis of the bayesian result



there were more samples  than nodes  in the present study. this compares well with previous biological studies. djebbari and quackenbush   <cit>  learned a bayesian network with  <dig> features from  <dig> samples, while gao and wang   <cit>  developed a bayesian network learned with  <dig> features from  <dig> samples. ideally, the use of many more samples would have allowed us to create the most robust model, but this need had to be offset against making an ethical and appropriate use of animals. nonetheless, the highly stringent bootstrapping approach used herein ensured robustness of the model. its purpose was to resample the data with replacement in order to avoid over-fitting so as to address the issue of using a limited number of samples. the final network contained  <dig> nodes wherein the maximum theoretical number of parents for each node could be  <dig>  networks were learned for each generated pseudo-dataset. model averaging of these was then performed to obtain edge confidence scores. the overall bootstrap confidence was estimated by evaluating how many times relative to the total number of iterations a particular feature of interest  appeared. the final network had an overall confidence of  <dig>  . increasing the confidence threshold from  <dig>  to  <dig>  had no effect, confirming the result with high confidence . this was further confirmed by the fact that a variational bayesian state space model  network  revealed conservation of the core network structure, including hubs  akin to those obtained from the seeded bayesian models . il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ), il- <dig>  eotaxin and mip-1β were parents, and rantes and tnf-α were terminal nodes . these topological changes were expected given that the vbssm network only featured a subset of the original network nodes following automated construction . the inference process was performed without prior knowledge bias of mediator interactions. as indicated in table  <dig>  the f-score value, high number of true negatives, and the relatively high sensitivity value when compared to the seeded network in fig.  <dig> show that there is a relatively high topographical similarity between the two. this is further confirmed by the retention of major regulatory hubs and the fact that all the edges associated with tnf-α are incoming.table  <dig> sensitivity, specificity and f-score values for comparisons between lactation, pup-free and vbbsm networks

bayesian networks model conditional independence so that accurately removing arcs from all possible connections is an important measurement for accuracy. this is reflected in the specificity, which is close to one if true negatives  are high and false positives  are low. for the purpose of internal validation , the vbssm-based results obtained without prior knowledge were compared to those from seeded bayesian learning. it is important to note that vbssm results were derived under a strict confidence level check. however, we cannot expect a high agreement in true positives  for the structural comparisons performed for both the lactation and pup-free data but the high tn and specificity values are encouraging . the last column represents the network structural comparison within the vbssm analysis between lactation and pup-free data



exploration of networks
perturbation of prl in silico
prl perturbation in silico in the lactation model was chosen as a starting point given that this hormone is widely considered as having potent immunomodulatory properties. perturbation was achieved by allocating its low concentration bin a conditional probability of  <dig>  this perturbation revealed that, apart from a fall in p <dig> profile, the downstream nodes, hubs and edges remained qualitatively unchanged  in conditional probabilities such that nodal status also remained unchanged , an observation supported by the lack of correlation between prl and the majority of other mediators . the terms ‘increased’ and ‘decreased’ are used as less cumbersome terminology throughout this manuscript to describe changes in node conditional probabilities following perturbation . the only exceptions were il- <dig>  mcp- <dig> and il- <dig>  whose concentrations ‘increased’, indicating a degree of negative regulation of these cytokines by prl . due to the relatively minor influence of in silico prl depletion on the overall network , further perturbations were performed in order to explore the relative importance of other network elements.table  <dig> changes in conditional probability associated with perturbation of prl and structural hubs

conditional probabilities are given to each of three bins . highest conditional probability values in any given bin indicate a greater likelihood of the relevant mediator’s concentration being in that concentration bin. the large font denotes the node of interest; small font indicates the perturbed parent node; a ‘-’ sign indicates perturbation by reducing concentration while a ‘+’ sign indicates perturbation by increasing concentration



il- <dig>  mcp- <dig> and il- <dig>  are key driver nodes
as outlined above, il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> were selected for perturbation by allocating them to a high concentration bin with a probability of  <dig>  . they were perturbed both individually and in combination. increasing il- <dig> concentration caused extensive network changes, including a shift in mcp- <dig> and gm-csf to a higher concentration and ifn-γ to a moderately high concentration . the effects extended as far downstream as the terminal node: kc became medium and mip-1α, rantes and tnf-α became more medium. note that the term ‘medium’ is used herein as shorthand to refer to the intermediate, mid-range relative concentration ‘equal frequency’ bin based on the data discretization . increasing mcp- <dig> resulted in similarly extensive changes: among its children, gm-csf concentration increased markedly while mip-1β and rantes became medium . further downstream effects included mip-1α concentration becoming high, kc moderately medium-high, and ifn-γ and tnf-α both more medium. prl branch perturbation  also resulted in significant changes to downstream node conditional probabilities as far as the terminal node . similarly marked effects were noted for combined prl/il-13/mcp- <dig> perturbation, which resulted in marked changes in all downstream hub statuses and conditional probability values .

as a major parent of the second network branch , il- <dig>  was chosen for perturbation. il- <dig>  perturbation in silico  had a dramatic downstream impact: il-1β, il- <dig>  and kc concentration increased, mip-1α became moderately high, and mip-1β, ifn-γ and tnf-α became medium . combined perturbations of both network branches  and eotaxin) also affected common downstream nodes .

mcp- <dig> can act synergistically with il- <dig> and/or il- <dig> 
the combined perturbation of il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> on a background of low prl had particularly marked effects on ifn-γ, resulting in an increase in its high concentration bin conditional probability , an effect greater than that achieved by each parent perturbation in isolation . this suggests the presence of a synergistic interaction in which il- <dig> may co-opt mcp- <dig> given that it is also one of its parents . however, more striking still were the synergistic effects of mcp- <dig> and il- <dig>  in relation to mip-1α . conditional probabilities in the mip-1α high concentration bin were much greater when both were combined . comparable, though less striking effects were noted for mip-1β when il- <dig>  and mcp- <dig> were perturbed together, and for ifn-γ when il- <dig>  and il- <dig> were perturbed in combination .fig.  <dig> synergistic and antagonistic relationships between mediators. schematic representation of a mcp- <dig> and il- <dig>  synergy on mip-1α with associated conditional probability table, and b antagonism between prl and il- <dig> on il-13



il- <dig> and prl are potentially antagonistic
similar perturbations of the parent node il- <dig> were also performed. allocation of il- <dig> to low, medium and high concentration bins affected il- <dig>  il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> concentrations to some degree, although the most striking feature of these changes was that the greatest effects were noted when il- <dig> concentration was medium, rather than high or low . perturbing il- <dig> by allocating it to a high concentration bin resulted in an increase in il- <dig> concentration, as did perturbing prl to a low concentration. this suggested that, as parents, il- <dig> and prl may be antagonistic in terms of their effects on il- <dig>  a notion supported by the intermediate conditional probabilities for il- <dig> concentration resulting from high levels of both these parents .

mip-1β exhibits a biphasic response to eotaxin
allocating eotaxin to a high concentration bin had minor effects, causing little more than a shift in mip-1β towards a higher concentration . by contrast, allocating eotaxin to a low concentration bin had marked effects on its children: il- <dig> concentration was reduced whereas mcp- <dig> and mip-1β became more medium, an effect carried through downstream to gm-csf . intriguingly, the shift in mip-1β concentration was in the same direction, independent of whether eotaxin concentration was perturbed upwards or downwards, suggesting a concentration-dependent biphasic response.

in vivo validation
cytokine profiles fall when lactation is not established
in order to determine experimentally the impact of lactation on cytokine and hormone profiles relative to a baseline, samples were obtained from dams whose pups were removed at birth . this physiological perturbation resulted in a fall in maternal serum concentrations of il- <dig> and a rise in kc on day  <dig>  . by day  <dig> post-partum, the differences between females with and without pups were more pronounced: il-1α, il- <dig> , il- <dig>  ifn-γ, g-csf, e <dig> and prl levels were significantly higher in nursing dams . similar trends were also noted for il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> .fig.  <dig> systemic cytokine profiles following parturition with and without lactation. comparison of cytokine and prl/p4/e <dig> concentrations in mice with/without pups on a day  <dig> and b day  <dig> of lactation 



comparison of bayesian networks
lactation and pup-free networks share striking similarities
strikingly, the pup-free dam bayesian network retained the same core structural hubs as the lactation network , with il- <dig>  as the principal parent and tnf-α as the terminal node, despite expected differences in network topology . this second network featured an additional parent , three orphan nodes  unconnected to the main network and a total of  <dig> edges  which connected  <dig> of the  <dig> nodes. when the lactation and pup-free dam networks were compared using accepted measures of network comparison , the f-score was  <dig>  and the total complexities of these networks were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. these scores imply a striking similarity in terms of topology and complexity between both networks despite their being generated from entirely independent data sets.fig.  <dig> bayesian network displaying cytokine interrelationships associated with pup-free dams in vivo. color coding of both nodes and edges is as described for fig.  <dig>  symbols indicate if the nodal concentration bin was correctly categorized by in silico perturbation. ✓✓ - correctly/closely categorized by prl perturbation alone. ✓ - correctly/closely categorized by prl perturbation in combination with il- <dig> , il- <dig> and mcp- <dig>  or by any other single mediator perturbation. x – not correctly categorized by any perturbation. * - could not be evaluated due to being upstream of the perturbations performed



as noted for the lactation network, the vbssm variant for pup-free dams retained many of the core features of its bayesian counterpart, with the exception of eotaxin which became a terminal node . il- <dig>  and il- <dig> were principal parents, with ifn-γ and mip-1β displayed as structural hubs. as with the earlier case, the inference process was performed without bias of any prior knowledge of the interactions between the cytokines being studied. the associated f-core of  <dig>   is low, although this was expected given the relatively low number of edges and nodes observed  in comparison to the seeded network obtained in fig.  <dig>  the high true negative values and specificity  as well as the conservation of the major regulatory hubs again point to the relatively high topological similarity between the vbssm and seeded networks .

in silico perturbation can correctly predict in vivo responses
the most striking difference between the two physiological networks was that half of the nodes had moved to high concentration bins  in the pup-free scenario, echoing the node status distribution in the in silico perturbed network driven by high concentration il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> . based on a comparison between predicted  and monitored  effects, prl perturbation alone only categorized four nodes correctly/closely . however, combined prl/il-13/mcp- <dig> perturbation correctly classified the qualitative  nodal status of p <dig>  il-1α, il- <dig> , rantes, tnf-α , ifn-γ  and gm-csf . close categorization was noted for mip-1β , il- <dig> , il- <dig>  and mip-1α  . in addition to having mcp- <dig> as a parent, mip-1α, mip-1β and ifn-γ were also children of il- <dig> , and perturbing both of these parents by allocating them to a high concentration bin in silico led to their correct categorization in the pup-free network . only the qualitative profile of g-csf, kc, il- <dig> and il- <dig> in the pup-free network could not be predicted/validated by in silico perturbation of the lactation network . thus, the relative changes of levels  as encoded in the probability tables broadly agreed with overall states of the nodes in the physiologically perturbed pup-free network model.

discussion
this study aimed to characterize physiological cytokine:cytokine and cytokine:hormone interactions in murine lactation as a model of inflammatory/immune mediator regulation using a bayesian network-based approach. this method revealed a robust lactation network structure featuring two main branches organized around principal parents , il- <dig>  e <dig> and eotaxin), structural hubs  and a terminal node . these pivotal roles resonate with the central role reported for these mediators in the control of cytokine networks: ifn-γ in atherogenesis  <cit> , il- <dig>  in those governing t cell and macrophage responses  <cit> , il- <dig> in the pathophysiology of ulcerative colitis  <cit> , ifn-γ, il- <dig>  and mcp- <dig> in erdheim-chester disease  <cit>  and eotaxin, ifn-γ, mip-1α and mip-1β in asthma  <cit> . a second network was generated from data drawn from pup-free dams in which removal of the suckling stimulus physiologically prevented the rise in prl levels characteristic of the onset of lactation. this second bayesian network, which validated in vivo the predictions made in silico, had broadly similar topology  and total network complexity and, most significantly, featured the same conserved structural hubs. these findings suggest that these hub nodes connected by high confidence edges may act as structural lynchpins around which both networks assemble, potentially playing a role in integrating diverse upstream cytokine-mediated signals to induce coordinated downstream responses. in silico network perturbation allowed a more detailed analysis of the relative contribution of various nodes to the control of the overall network behavior. the results also pointed to the presence of ‘driver’ nodes . in this respect, one branch parent ) and two structural hubs  were responsible for orchestrating the most significant changes within the network, thereby reinforcing the proposed concept of a signal integration role played by the latter two cytokines.

the original premise underlying the choice of lactation as a model system was that this physiological setting would feature marked changes in prl, a hormone that has been proposed as a central regulator of cytokine networks  <cit> . surprisingly, prl functioned neither as a parent nor as a structural hub, and its only connection to the rest of the network via p <dig> was through a weak confidence edge. however, the cluster analysis demonstrated that most cytokine profiles clustered separately and peaked later than prl suggesting that these may be independently regulated in vivo, as reflected by the bayesian analysis. furthermore, when prl was perturbed  in silico, there were, with the notable exception of p <dig>  only minor qualitative shifts in conditional probability values in downstream mediators . these findings point to a limited role for prl as an immunoregulator in murine lactation, the presence of extensive functional redundancy for its actions and/or, possibly, reflect the fact that its purported effects on cytokine profiles are largely drawn from the in vitro setting. our findings are consistent with the observation that both prl and prl receptor knockout mice do not feature substantial immune dysfunction  <cit> . the effects of prl on mcp- <dig> are rather more unclear: in contrast to our findings, existing data implicate prl as an inducer of mcp- <dig> in ovarian luteolysis and lactational bone resorption  <cit> , although the systemic/circulatory relationship between these mediators in response to the prolactinaemia of lactation remains unknown. nevertheless, its effect on p <dig> supports prl’s reported role in increasing serum p <dig> in rats  <cit> .

in silico perturbation of downstream il- <dig>  by contrast, had marked effects on network response, suggesting that this cytokine had a threshold conditional probability at which downstream signaling was achieved which prl alone as an il- <dig> input function was unable to achieve. it is tempting to speculate that oxytocin, a lactation-related neurohypophyseal hormone which causes smooth muscle contraction during the let-down reflex, may represent an additional input given that the highest cytokine concentrations coincided with the period of maximal suckling/milk production . this would be consistent with oxytocin’s known modulation of cytokine production and receptor-dependent activity in a range of settings  <cit> , and the ability of il- <dig> to modulate oxytocin receptor expression  <cit> .

a principal aspect of this study focused on the ability of in silico perturbation to predict cytokine levels in a different physiological scenario in vivo. this premise’s biological validation was achieved by comparing in silico lactation network behavior following perturbation induced by pup removal and the consequent abrogation of lactation in vivo. strikingly, allocation of the driver nodes il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> to high concentration bins in silico  correctly  predicted the relative concentration status of  <dig> out of their  <dig> downstream cytokines in vivo. il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> perturbation less accurately predicted mip-1α and mip-1β’s response to pup removal . however, they were correctly categorized when their direct driver node parent  and mcp-1) perturbations were used instead. these findings are consistent with the documented effects of mcp- <dig> induction of mip-1α expression in murine aneurysm models and total il- <dig> induction of mip-1α in isolated human natural killer cells   <cit> . by contrast, in silico perturbation failed to predict the cytokine concentration response of the peripheral terminal cytokine kc correctly. these findings may be accounted for by the possibility that despite kc being connected to its parents via high confidence edges in the lactation network, its regulation may be under the control of additional mediators and/or involve changes in cell-specific receptor expression not measured as part of this investigation.

in silico lactation network perturbation also pointed to a recognized feature of cytokine interactions: synergy . previous studies have found il- <dig> to be a selective inducer of mcp- <dig>  <cit>  as supported by the present data. furthermore, we noted an additional and previously unreported synergistic relationship between these mediators in relation to ifn-γ concentration. when il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> were perturbed together , this resulted in a greater increase in ifn-γ concentration than that observed when either was perturbed alone. further, more striking evidence of synergy was noted following the combined perturbations of both network branches. il- <dig>  and mcp- <dig> perturbation independently increased the concentration of their direct child mip-1α, but this effect was markedly greater when these parents were perturbed together. analogous, though less pronounced synergistic interactions were also noted for combined il- <dig>  and il- <dig> perturbation which, independently, are both known to increase ifn-γ concentration  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, these synergistic functional relationships have not previously been reported in the literature and will form the basis of our future investigations into how widespread/conserved these relationships occur across different physiological/pathological settings, body compartments  and species.

in silico lactation network perturbation also revealed another functional property of inflammatory networks: antagonism . in this regard, il- <dig> and prl had opposing actions on il- <dig>  with il- <dig> seemingly increasing il- <dig> concentrations , such that when these parents were perturbed together , the effect on il- <dig> was greater than those induced by the independent perturbation of its parents .

another recognized property of cytokine networks is functional redundancy, wherein two independent mediators can fulfill the same role, thereby physiologically compensating for each other’s absence. in both in vivo scenarios, il- <dig> was peripheral to the main bayesian network despite tracking il- <dig> levels, as established by the cluster analysis. this feature suggests functional redundancy, which is consistent with the fact that il- <dig> and il- <dig> are known to operate through the same receptor system  <cit> . it is worth noting that il- <dig> and g-csf were also orphaned in the pup-free dam network. it is unclear whether this reflects true functional redundancy rather than simply the smaller sample size used to construct this particular network. however, even in the lactation network where a larger overall sample size was used, the edges connecting il- <dig> and g-csf to the rest of the network were of low confidence. this highlights the caveat that the interpretation of bayesian networks can benefit from additional a priori functional knowledge of the mediators investigated and that larger data sets - unsurprisingly - generate models which more accurately represent mediator inter-relationships, as demonstrated by the use of vbssm models.

another interesting phenomenon noted was the response of mip-1β to changes induced by in silico eotaxin manipulation. intriguingly, perturbing eotaxin to either high or low concentrations both resulted in mip-1β concentration being higher. concentration-dependent paradoxical effects are well recognized among cytokines and, in this instance, mip-1β responses point to a concentration-dependent biphasic response to eotaxin. the implications of this observation are currently unclear but we speculate that this relationship allows scope for homeostatic control, possibly through the existence of physiological feedback loops undetectable using bayesian methodologies. alternatively, this may, as outlined for kc, reflect the influence of unknown mediators not measured as part of this investigation.

the broad conservation of cytokine relationships across physiological scenarios points to their integrated regulation and indicates that changes in a small number of driver nodes can potentially affect the concentration of multiple downstream mediators. given their critical role in orchestrating cytokine networks, identifying driver nodes such as il- <dig> , il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> may prove valuable in the exogenous manipulation of inflammatory networks. major, more predictable network changes could thus be induced through the selective targeting of driver nodes . moreover, desired cytokine level modulation could be induced without causing major network disruptions in instances where terminal nodes are targeted instead. this would be consistent with current clinical practices such as the use of anti-tnf therapy in the management of a range of autoimmune disorders . interestingly, comparative trials of various agents in rheumatoid arthritis suggest that agents such as these  are superior to those targeting other cytokines such as il- <dig>   <cit> , which reside further upstream in our models. if analogous networks could be constructed using clinical data, there would be scope for developing novel, targeted therapeutic interventions with more predictable immune-related side effects.

this bayesian network-based analysis has proved valuable in clarifying the complex structure and causal murine systemic cytokine-hormone network relationships. however, these findings must be interpreted in the light of certain caveats. firstly, the present bayesian networks are necessarily incomplete by virtue of the fact that they do not contain the entire array of possible interacting mediators. secondly, the interpretation of predicted qualitative changes in network behavior must be considered in a context-specific manner in order to glean physiologically meaningful inferences from the data . thirdly, they do not represent all possible edges given that the methodology inherently precludes the use of structural loops  <cit> . this accounts for why the present networks consistently feature tnf-α as the terminal node, despite studies indicating that, for example, tnf-α can induce mip-1β expression in mice  <cit> . fourthly, these networks allow investigators to make valuable predictions about causality, although these may still require empirical verification through specific experiments in vivo and/or in vitro . nevertheless, the present findings are, to the best of our knowledge, the earliest available data providing a detailed characterization and assessment of cytokine networks in a whole animal model. the networks generated were statistically robust and independently corroborated many established cytokine interrelationships described in the literature  and ifn-γ)  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the identification of synergy, antagonism, functional redundancy and concentration-dependent biphasic responses within these networks lifts this method of analysis from being purely descriptive to mechanistic. this suggests that bayesian in vivo cytokine networks as shown herein describe real physiological changes in a non-biased fashion, in contrast to modeling endeavors performed on in vitro systems  or differential gene expression studies   <cit> . furthermore, the identification of conserved regulatory hubs points to the existence of a previously unknown core structure within these cytokine networks whose responses can be predicted with some accuracy. whilst we believe that the exciting findings of this study are a significant first step towards improving our understanding of complex systemic inflammatory/immune networks, we remain mindful that many of the relationships described herein remain to be individually and more fully validated in the in vivo setting. we accept that multiple approaches may be needed in this context in order to build a comprehensive picture of multiple interactions, such as the use of  knock-out animal models and infusions of cytokine traps, antibodies, cytokines and their soluble/decoy receptors. to this end, our future work will focus on establishing whether the network structures that we have identified herein appear to be conserved across both a range of pathophysiological scenarios  as well as across species.
