BACKGROUND
in  <dig> genome wide association studies  were published describing polymorphisms in a number of genes associated with an increased risk of developing alzheimer’s disease  including picalm   <cit> . picalm is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . subsequently, the large igap  study identified further genes encoding the endocytic proteins bin <dig>  and sorl <dig>  that reached genome-wide significance  <cit> . pathway analysis of the igap study  <cit>  identified a number of biological pathways associated with ad including the regulation of endocytosis, thus emphasising the importance of this pathway in the pathogenesis of ad and suggesting areas for development of new therapies  <cit> .

the amyloid cascade hypothesis is the leading theory to explain the aetiology of ad  <cit> , suggesting that understanding how the production of β-amyloid  from amyloid precursor protein  is controlled should improve intervention strategies. after synthesis, some app is transported via the secretory pathway to the cell surface and internalised by endocytosis for processing including cleavage by one of two routes  <cit> . in the amyloidogenic pathway, β-secretase  cleaves app to give two fragments, sappβ and c <dig> . the γ-secretase complex then cleaves c <dig> to produce aβ and a c-terminal fragment  . the alternative non-amyloidogenic pathway involves cleavage of app by α-secretase within the aβ region to release sappα and precludes the formation of aβ  <cit> . it is thought that most amyloidogenic processing of app occurs after endocytosis in the endocytic/lysosomal system  <cit> . endocytosis is thus central to the production of aβ as it controls where app is localised in the cell and which enzymes it encounters  <cit> .

altered cme has been described previously in ad. early endocytic changes  have been seen in post-mortem ad brains  <cit> . inhibition of cme in vivo in app transgenic mice and dynamin-dependent endocytosis in vitro lowered aβ levels  <cit> , while upregulation of endocytosis increased app metabolism and aβ secretion  <cit> . therefore endocytosis is strongly implicated in ad pathogenic processes.

picalm is involved in the recruitment of clathrin and other proteins to the membrane and thus regulates the formation of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles in cme  <cit> ; though how it might be involved in endocytosis in ad remains unclear. however, subjects carrying the ad risk alleles in picalm and clusterin show significantly poorer episodic memory, a marker for ad onset  <cit> . in yeast, deletion of picalm homologues protected against aβ-induced toxicity  <cit> . in contrast, the presence of picalm protective alleles appeared to be associated with an increase in picalm mrna expression in human brain  <cit>  and to protect against senile plaque development  <cit> . decreased picalm expression has been noted in ad brains along with abnormal cleavage fragments of picalm and the association of picalm with neurofibrillary tangles  <cit> . thus picalm may play an important role in ad, but the mechanism by which it does this is unclear. since the processing of app to aβ is dependent on cme, our study aimed to investigate the contribution of picalm to modulating the metabolism of app and whether endocytotic processes were involved in that modulation.

we used the human brain-derived h <dig> neuroglioma cell line that expresses endogenous levels of app as we wanted to look at the effects of picalm on physiologically relevant levels of app, more relevant to the situation found in ad patients. we found that these cells expressed picalm isoforms  <dig> and  <dig>  having depleted levels of picalm by sirna targeting all four isoforms, we showed that the levels of intracellular app, the intracellular β-c-terminal fragment  and secreted sappβ  were significantly reduced but aβ <dig> itself was not affected. functional cme measured by transferrin uptake was significantly reduced after both depletion of picalm and clathrin heavy chain . in contrast, depletion of clathrin did not affect app levels but did reduce those of β-ctf. picalm depletion altered the intracellular distribution of clathrin with less staining found in the perinuclear transgolgi region while clathrin depletion affected the subcellular pattern of picalm labelling. both picalm and clathrin depletion reduced the expression of bace <dig> mrna and picalm sirna reduced protein levels. in contrast to the findings for depletion of all picalm isoforms, individual depletion of picalm isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> by specific sirnas did not affect app levels. clathrin depletion had a more complicated differential effect on the isoforms, increasing isoform  <dig> protein and mrna expression while decreasing isoform  <dig> protein expression but not affecting mrna levels.

RESULTS
effects of sirna to total picalm on picalm mrna and protein expression
in h <dig> cells, we detected two bands for picalm using western blotting with molecular masses of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kda . four main isoforms  of picalm have been identified  <cit>  . it is likely that the  <dig>  kda band equates to isoform  <dig>  with a predicted mass of  <dig>  kda and the  <dig>  kda band to isoform  <dig>  with a predicted mass of  <dig>  kda. we saw no evidence of bands with a predicted mass of  <dig>  kda or  <dig>  kda, equating to isoforms  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, in our cells.fig.  <dig> picalm levels in h <dig> cells following sirna treatments. a representative immunoblot of picalm after transfecting h <dig> cells for 48 h with control sirna  or sirna targeting picalm  and b following densitometric analysis. data are presented as mean ± sem as a percentage of the untreated media control after normalisation to house-keeping protein levels, n =  <dig>  ***p <  <dig>  significantly different to gfp sirna with an unpaired student’s t test. c picalm mrna expression levels using quantitative pcr, normalised to the housekeeping gene 18s and relative to the untreated cells. data are presented as mean ± sem, n =  <dig>  **p <  <dig>  significantly different to gfp sirna with mann–whitney-u



using an sirna sequence directed against all the isoforms of picalm , we significantly reduced the total levels of picalm to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of levels in control cells incubated with sirna to gfp where picalm levels were unaffected . in parallel, picalm mrna levels were reduced to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of those in gfp control sirna cells . in immunocytochemistry, total picalm depletion greatly reduced the marked punctate cytoplasmic and membrane-associated staining for picalm seen in gfp control cells . there was no apparent perinuclear labelling seen for picalm in gfp control cells .fig.  <dig> picalm , clathrin , app  and bace <dig>  localisation after different sirna treatments. h <dig> cells were incubated for  <dig> h with control sirna , sirna targeting picalm  or clathrin heavy chain . proteins were detected using a biotinylated secondary antibody and an fitc-conjugated avidin construct , nuclei are counterstained with dapi . images were taken with a leica sp <dig> confocal laser scanning microscope and are representative from n =  <dig> . arrows indicate the reduced cytoplasmic and membrane-associated staining seen after treatment with picalm sirna  compared to gfp sirna

effects of sirna to total picalm on endocytosis
having demonstrated an extensive reduction in the levels of picalm, we investigated whether other proteins involved in cme were affected by sirna to picalm. figure  <dig> shows that neither levels of chc nor dynamin ii were significantly affected by the reduction in picalm levels. in addition, sirna to picalm had no significant effect on chc mrna with a reduction in mrna levels for chc to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of those in gfp control sirna cells . however, although clathrin levels overall were unaltered, we did see a reduction in the labelling for clathrin in the perinuclear region of cells depleted of picalm compared to control cells, probably representing the transgolgi network . furthermore, depletion of total picalm significantly reduced the uptake of transferrin to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of gfp levels after  <dig> and 30 min, respectively .fig.  <dig> clathrin and dynamin ii protein expression levels following sirna treatments. a representative immunoblots of clathrin and dynamin ii after incubating h <dig> cells for 48 h with media, control sirna  or sirna targeting picalm , b densitometric analysis of clathrin, n =  <dig> and c densitometric analysis of dynamin ii, n =  <dig>  data are presented as mean ± sem as a percentage of the untreated media control after normalisation to house-keeping protein levels

effects of sirna to total picalm on the metabolism of app
sirna to total picalm significantly reduced the expression of app to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of the gfp control levels in h <dig> cells . we repeated the experiment looking at app levels using a different, but equally effective, sirna to picalm  which reduced picalm levels to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of gfp control levels. this sirna had a similar effect on app expression, reducing it to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of gfp levels . reduced levels of app protein after picalm sirna were also seen by immunocytochemistry in h <dig> cells but the distribution of intracellular app did not appear to be affected . however, the levels of aβ <dig> were not affected by picalm depletion . aβ <dig> could not be measured in the h <dig> cells as the levels were below the detection limits of elisas . further investigation of the fragments of app found that sappα was unaffected by reducing picalm expression . in contrast, the proportion of sappβ to sappα  was significantly reduced by total picalm sirna to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of gfp control levels . βctf levels were significantly reduced to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of gfp levels . in contrast to the effect on protein expression, mrna levels for app were unaffected by treatment with sirna to picalm compared to gfp . however, picalm sirna significantly reduced the amount of bace <dig> mrna compared to gfp sirna to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % . there was also a significant decrease in bace <dig> protein levels to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of gfp levels as measured by elisa following treatment with picalm sirna . however, no apparent differences were detectable in the amount or distribution of staining for bace <dig> after picalm depletion .fig.  <dig> effects of picalm and clathrin sirna on app processing. h <dig> cells were incubated with media, control sirna , sirna targeting picalm  or clathrin heavy chain  for 48 h. levels of app after treatment with  and , c aβ <dig>  d sappβ:sappα, e βctf and h bace <dig> as detected by elisa. data are expressed as % of media control  and are mean ± sem, *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig>  significantly different to gfp sirna with an unpaired student’s t test, n =  <dig> , n =  <dig> , n =  <dig>  n =  <dig> , n =  <dig> , n =  <dig> . f app and g bace <dig> mrna expression levels measured using quantitative pcr, normalised to the housekeeping gene polr2a and relative to the untreated cells. data are expressed as mean ± sem, *p <  <dig>  significantly different to gfp sirna with one-way analysis of variance and dunnett’s multiple comparison test n =  <dig>  unless specified, cells were treated with sirna targeting picalm sequence a



association of picalm gwas snps with picalm isoform expression
using the gibbs et al.  <cit>  eqtl dataset  and the uk brain expression consortium eqtl dataset  <cit>   we found that the risk  allele of the most significant snp in picalm rs <dig>  <cit> , and the risk allele  of the most significant snp in picalm from igap rs <dig>  <cit> , are both associated with a significant decrease in picalm isoform  <dig> mrna expression in the frontal  and temporal cortex  and the medulla from the trabzuni dataset  <cit>  . however, there was no significant change in the expression of picalm isoform  <dig> mrna associated with either rs <dig> or rs <dig> 

effects of sirna to picalm isoforms on picalm mrna and protein expression
given that the picalm snps were associated with differential changes in the expression of the isoforms of picalm, we examined the contribution of the isoforms of picalm to its functions in endocytosis and potential involvement with the processing of app. we designed sirna to the two most abundant isoforms we identified in the h <dig> cells, isoforms  <dig> and  <dig>  figure 6a, b shows that an sirna to isoform  <dig> significantly depleted the expression of this isoform to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of gfp levels, without significantly affecting isoform  <dig>  it was very difficult to design an sirna for isoform  <dig> which did not have a significant effect on isoform  <dig> because of their overlapping sequences and the most selective sirna for isoform  <dig> produced a smaller significant reduction to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  of gfp levels, without affecting isoform  <dig> . mrna for isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> were both significantly reduced to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively, from gfp levels by sirna to total picalm .fig.  <dig> picalm levels following sirna treatments targeting isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> of picalm, total picalm and clathrin. a representative immunoblots of picalm isoforms after incubating h <dig> cells for 48 h with media or sirna targeting either total picalm , picalm isoform  <dig>  picalm isoform  <dig>  clathrin or gfp for 48 h. b densitometric western blot analysis of the levels of picalm, isoform  <dig> and c isoform  <dig>  data are presented as a percentage of the untreated media control after normalisation to house-keeping protein levels and are mean ± sem, n = 6– <dig>  *p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig>  significantly different to gfp sirna following one-way analysis of variance and dunnett’s multiple comparison test  or kruskal–wallis test and dunn’s multiple comparison test . d picalm isoform  <dig> and e picalm isoform  <dig> mrna expression levels measured using quantitative pcr, normalised to the housekeeping gene polr2a and relative to the untreated cells, n = 5– <dig>  ***p <  <dig>  significantly different to gfp sirna following one-way analysis of variance and dunnett’s multiple comparison test



effects of sirna to isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> of picalm on the metabolism of app
in contrast to the sirna to total picalm which significantly reduced app levels, neither sirna to isoform  <dig> nor isoform  <dig> significantly affected the levels of app . similarly, only the sirna to total picalm significantly reduced the cleavage of app to the βctf fragment with the sirna to isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> having no significant effect .fig.  <dig> effects of picalm sirna targeting isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> of picalm on app processing. levels of a app and b βctf in h <dig> cells, as detected by elisa following incubation with media, or sirna targeting either total picalm , picalm isoform  <dig>  picalm isoform  <dig> or gfp for 48 h. data are expressed as % of media control and are mean ± sem, *p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig>  significantly different to gfp sirna with a one-way analysis of variance and dunnett’s multiple comparison test, n =  <dig>  and, n = 4– <dig> 



effects of sirna to clathrin heavy chain on endocytosis and app expression
having shown that depletion of picalm affected functional endocytosis, clathrin localisation and app processing, we examined whether knocking down clathrin itself would have any effect on picalm or app processing. using sirna to chc and compared to gfp sirna-treated control cells, we significantly reduced the expression of chc protein to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % , chc mrna to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %  and greatly reduced cell staining for clathrin . this reduction in clathrin produced concomitant significant decreases in cme to  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of gfp levels after  <dig>   <dig> and 30 min, respectively . sirna to chc had no effect at all on the mrna for total picalm . it did not significantly affect the total amount of picalm at the protein level but did differentially affect the expression of isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> of picalm, resulting in a significant decrease in isoform  <dig> expression to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of gfp control levels . there was also a concomitant increase in isoform  <dig> but this did not reach significance . at the mrna level sirna to chc significantly increased isoform  <dig> mrna to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %  but had no significant effect on isoform  <dig> mrna . following sirna to chc, labelling for picalm was altered with more pronounced staining seen in the cytoplasm and less at the membrane . however, unlike the effect of the decrease in picalm on app processing, this reduction in chc expression did not significantly alter the levels of app  but did significantly reduce the levels of βctf to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of gfp levels . similarly to picalm sirna, mrna levels for app were unaffected by chc sirna  but bace <dig> mrna was significantly reduced by chc sirna to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % . bace <dig> protein levels measured by elisa were not significantly altered by chc sirna . the labelling for app and bace <dig> were not affected by sirna to chc .fig.  <dig> effects of clathrin sirna on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. h <dig> cells were incubated with media, control sirna  or sirna targeting clathrin heavy chain  for 48 h. a representative immunoblot of clathrin expression and b following densitometric analysis. data are presented as a percentage of the untreated media control after normalisation to house-keeping protein levels and are mean ± sem, n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  significantly different to gfp sirna with an unpaired student’s t test. c clathrin mrna expression levels using quantitative pcr, normalised to the housekeeping gene 18s and relative to the untreated cells. data are presented as mean ± sem, n =  <dig>  **p <  <dig>  significantly different to gfp sirna with mann–whitney-u. d h <dig> cells were incubated with 100 nm alexa488-tf for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  minutes then trypsinised and analysed by flow cytometry. mean fluorescent intensity  data are expressed as fold change over untreated control cells  and are mean ± sem *p <  <dig> ,**p <  <dig>  significantly different to gfp sirna with an unpaired student’s t test, n = 4–5

discussion
we have demonstrated that reducing the expression of picalm or clathrin inhibits cme to a similar extent and reduces β-secretase-mediated cleavage of app but only picalm sirna affects the levels of app. thus picalm can influence the processing of app via more than one route possibly contributing to its role as a risk factor for ad.

the gene for picalm gives rise to a number of isoforms  of which  <dig> appear to be the most common  <cit> . in the h <dig> cells we consistently found isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> with apparent higher expression levels of isoform  <dig> but did not detect isoforms  <dig> or  <dig>  therefore all further work concentrated on isoforms  <dig> and  <dig>  a similar pattern has been described by other authors with isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> being the predominant forms . our two different sirna sequences , directed against a region common to all four isoforms, consistently demonstrated a large reduction in the expression of picalm with no significant toxic effects from either measure. thus our data suggest that the reduction was specific to picalm and that picalm is not critical for cell survival.

reducing picalm expression by sirna significantly inhibited the uptake of transferrin by functional cme in the h <dig> cells suggesting that, in these cells, picalm is essential for normal levels of cme to occur, probably due to its involvement in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles  <cit> . these data agree with other findings on functional cme where reducing  <cit>  or increasing  <cit>  the expression of picalm resulted in changes in transferrin uptake. other studies have described no effect of sirna for picalm on transferrin uptake  <cit>  but all these studies only measured endocytosis at short time intervals of 5–10 min so would not have seen effects occurring up to 30 min. furthermore, this study used a quantitative assay in living cells unlike some other papers. it is also, however, possible that these findings could be explained by certain cells being capable of overcoming picalm depletion by increased reliance on its homologue, ap <dig>  <cit> .

the consequent decrease in functional endocytosis following picalm depletion does not involve dynamin or a change in the levels of clathrin since neither mrna nor protein levels for chc were altered by knockdown of picalm. however, the localisation of clathrin in the transgolgi network was reduced by picalm depletion possibly due to redistribution in the cell since overall protein expression was unaltered. a reduction in clathrin expression in the transgolgi network has been described previously for both decreasing  <cit>  and increasing  <cit>  the expression of picalm, suggesting that picalm is important for the correct localisation of clathrin in the cell. picalm itself was not present in the perinuclear region, confirming previous findings  <cit> , so it is most likely to have an indirect effect on the targeting of clathrin to different subcellular areas. the control of trafficking between the early endosome and the transgolgi network involves many proteins so depletion of picalm could affect multiple targets  <cit> . picalm is very important for controlling the endocytosis of r-snares  such as vamp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> which are necessary for the fusion of endocytic vesicles containing various cargoes with endosomes or the plasma membrane for recycling  <cit> . vamp <dig> is also involved with the tethering of endosomes to the transgolgi network  <cit>  so affecting vamp <dig> function by depleting picalm could reduce the amount of clathrin in the transgolgi network. depleting cells of clathrin using sirna to clathrin heavy chain significantly reduced transferrin uptake as expected  <cit> . interestingly, we saw a different time course for depletion of clathrin or picalm to affect significantly the uptake of transferrin. al soraj and co-workers  <cit>  found the largest effect of clathrin depletion was at early time points and suggested that, at later time points, the effect of reduced recycling of transferrin from endosomes became more important. thus the effects of picalm depletion may be affected less by recycling from endosomes.

consistent with previous findings showing that app is internalised by endocytosis  <cit>  and that picalm is involved in this process  <cit> , we saw a decrease in the expression of intracellular app after depletion of picalm. the specificity of this effect on app to picalm was confirmed using a second total picalm sirna sequence. xiao et al.  <cit>  did not see an effect on full-length app after depletion of picalm possibly due to their use of cells overexpressing app where normal physiological mechanisms might be affected. however, the consequence of depleting picalm on app levels is additional to an effect on the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles as reducing clathrin did not affect app levels. picalm can affect transcription  <cit> , but the levels of app mrna were not altered by depleting picalm so the change in app is very unlikely to be due to reduced protein synthesis. it was also not due to a change in the subcellular location of app in our cells. it is therefore more likely that this reduction in app is due to the disruption of r-snare proteins by picalm depletion. changes in vamp <dig> and vamp  <dig> have been postulated to explain the increased levels of total cellular cholesterol seen after picalm knockdown  <cit> . it is possible that the alterations in app we see after picalm sirna could also be partly due to changes in cellular cholesterol homeostasis.

depleting picalm expression decreased β-secretase cleavage of app as the levels of βctf were reduced and a decrease in the sappβ/sappα ratio was seen. α-secretase activity was unaffected by depletion of picalm. a role for picalm in targeting ctf fragments of app for degradation by autophagy has been suggested  <cit> . thus an increase in β-ctf levels would be expected if picalm levels are reduced but we saw the reverse. therefore the decrease in β-ctf levels must occur upstream of autophagic processes, most likely via an effect on β-secretase. although β-secretase cleavage was affected by knockdown of picalm, the levels of aβ <dig> were unaffected agreeing with other studies  <cit> . βctf is very likely to be involved in the development of the enlarged endosomes seen in both ad and down syndrome  <cit> . βctf is thought to activate rab <dig> via appl <dig>   <cit>  leading eventually to endosomal enlargement  <cit> . βctf may thus have an important role in the pathogenesis of ad  <cit>  and therefore decreasing picalm expression would be protective by lowering βctf production. the decrease in βctf we see is likely to be due in part to the reduction in endocytosis produced by picalm depletion decreasing the entry of app into the cells as it was also seen after knock down of clathrin. however, the effect of picalm depletion on βctf was greater than that produced by clathrin, providing further support for an effect of picalm on app independent of cme.

previous work has shown that picalm affects the endocytosis of γ-secretase and this was proposed to explain the effects of depletion of picalm on aβ generation  <cit> . however, we have clearly demonstrated here an effect on the cleavage of app by β-secretase after depletion of picalm probably due to less app being endocytosed into early endosomes to encounter β-secretase. there was no apparent effect on the distribution of bace <dig> in picalm-depleted cells compared to control cells. both picalm and clathrin depletion reduced the levels of bace mrna by about 20 % and picalm depletion reduced protein levels by  <dig>  % with a trend for a decrease of  <dig>  % seen with chc sirna, suggesting an effect on bace synthesis. the reduction in bace <dig> levels is unlikely to be due to an effect on endocytosis as it was seen at the mrna level and clathrin sirna, which reduced functional endocytosis, did not affect bace <dig> protein expression. however, this reduction in bace <dig> levels is unlikely to explain the 35–60 % decrease in βctf production obtained with picalm and chc depletion as a 50 % decrease in bace <dig> levels in transgenic bace1 ± mice resulted in reductions in aβ of no more than 12–40 %  <cit> . therefore it appears unlikely that a change in the levels of β-secretase itself is responsible for the effects of picalm and clathrin depletion on βctf levels.

having examined the effect of depletion of total picalm on app metabolism and, given that the expression of isoform  <dig> was lower than isoform  <dig> in h <dig> cells, we investigated whether the isoforms had differential effects on app endocytosis and processing. we depleted isoform  <dig> and  <dig> individually using specific sirnas which did not significantly affect the other isoform thus confirming that the two bands we saw in the h <dig> cells were indeed isoform  <dig> and  <dig>  interestingly, depletion of either isoform alone had no significant effect on the levels of app or βctf so both picalm isoforms must be involved in functional endocytosis in the h <dig> cells. however, the differential effect of clathrin depletion on the expression of the isoforms at both the mrna and protein level does suggest that they may have different roles in cme. clathrin depletion increased both the protein and mrna for isoform  <dig> but decreased isoform  <dig> protein without altering the mrna. the discrepancy for isoform  <dig> may be due to differences in mrna stability between the two isoforms. the increase in one picalm isoform and the decrease in the other may explain why clathrin depletion had no effect on app levels. the intracellular localisation of total picalm was altered by clathrin depletion which could reflect differential changes in the expression of isoforms  <dig> and  <dig>  we could not investigate this finding further to understand the mechanism involved as there are no commercial antibodies available which can distinguish between isoforms  <dig> and  <dig>  our findings from the eqtl data sets, showing an association between a decrease in isoform  <dig> mrna expression but no effects on isoform  <dig> mrna for the harold and co-workers  <cit>  and igap  <cit>  snps, are interesting given that we and others find that control cells generally have higher levels of isoform  <dig> than isoform  <dig>  these data suggest that the ratio of the two isoforms may be important physiologically. however, given that we found that both isoforms needed to be knocked down to decrease app and βctf expression, it is currently unclear how the differential association of the gwas picalm snps with isoform expression are related to the processing of app. our data suggest that the relationship between picalm and app processing is likely to be highly complex and requires further investigation. there are very few published studies examining the biological effects of manipulating the isoforms of picalm. kanatsu and colleagues  <cit>  looked at the effects of overexpressing isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> on aβ secretion but did not see any differences. other workers have shown reversal of the protective effect of depletion of picalm yeast homologue isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> by mammalian isoform  <dig>   <cit> . parikh et al.  <cit>  examined the association of mrnas for various splice variants of picalm with a snp encoding a polymorphism in the gene associated with ad and found increased total picalm expression correlated with the protective allele but there was no significant correlation with the splice variants.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that the depletion of picalm in h <dig> cells has significant effects on the processing of app, probably by reducing cleavage by β-secretase. the reduction in βctf production is particularly interesting as this is now increasingly thought to have toxic effects on cells independent of aβ. these effects are likely to be mediated by at least two processes, a reduction in cme and an alteration in the endocytosis of endocytic vesicles. based on our data and on evidence from the literature, we hypothesise that polymorphisms of picalm could alter the expression of the protein over the lifetime of an individual which would be associated with either an increased risk of developing ad or a protective effect. further studies are required to elucidate the relative importance of these different roles of picalm and the relevance of the isoforms to app processing.
