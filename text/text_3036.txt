BACKGROUND
the pancreas is an organ containing both exocrine and endocrine cell populations. the exocrine pancreas consists of acini and ducts that produce and transport enzymes and bicarbonate to the digestive tract. lineage tracing studies have revealed that both endocrine and exocrine cells are derived from pdx1-expressing progenitors  <cit> . the endocrine cells are organized in the islets of langerhans which contain five distinct cell types, each characterized by the production of specific peptide hormones  <cit> . endocrine cells begin to appear soon after the first morphological signs of pancreas formation which occurs approximately at the 25-somite stage in the mouse and chicken  <cit> . endocrine development depends on neurogenin <dig>  and is initiated by the onset of ngn <dig> expression in a subset of pancreatic progenitor cells  <cit> . all endocrine cells are derived from ngn <dig> expressing precursors and the vast majority, if not all, of the ngn <dig> expressing cells are committed to the endocrine lineage  <cit> 

several studies have demonstrated that notch signaling is involved in the development of endocrine cells in the pancreas. mice harboring mutations in the notch pathway genes dll <dig>  rbk-jκ, and hes <dig> all display precocious and excessive endocrine development as early as e <dig>   <cit> . at this stage there is an increase in the numbers of ngn <dig> positive cells in dll <dig> and rbp-jκ mutants, and at e <dig>  an increase in endocrine cells. ngn <dig> expression was not analyzed in hes <dig> mutants but these had increased numbers of glucagon-producing cells at e <dig> . together these studies suggest that notch signaling prevents endocrine differentiation through a mechanism known as lateral inhibition where the notch ligand dll <dig>  expressed in differentiating cells, signals through notch receptors on adjacent cells thereby keeping them undifferentiated or acquiring a secondary fate. however, notch signaling may act to regulate differentiation by controlling the proneural genes at the transcriptional level or notch signaling could act in already committed precursors by inhibiting proneural factors posttranslationally. these are not mutually exclusive mechanisms and indeed both have been proposed  <cit> . later studies have suggested that notch signaling not only regulates endocrine specification but also inhibits exocrine differentiation  <cit> . this was further supported by the finding that hes <dig>  a notch target gene, is active in exocrine precursors in the mouse pancreas and prevents their terminal differentiation, and that loss of notch signaling in zebrafish accelerate exocrine differentiation  <cit> . subsequently, jagged mediated notch signaling has been suggested to mediate a fate choice between exocrine and intrapancreatic duct fate from a common precursor cell in zebrafish  <cit> . this is most likely different from the situation in mice where duct cell progenitors and exocrine progenitors appear to diverge very early in development between e <dig>  and e <dig> , prior to expression of jagged- <dig>  <cit> .

here we show that the expression of pro-endocrine bhlh factors and notch pathway components is conserved in the embryonic chicken pancreas and identify hes6- <dig> as being expressed in the endocrine lineage in the embryonic pancreas. we demonstrate that inhibition of notch signaling results in increased endocrine differentiation, and that activated notch <dig>  blocks endocrine development and maintains proliferation of pancreatic progenitor cells in the embryonic chicken pancreas. we demonstrate that notch1icd is able to inhibit ngn <dig> activity as it prevents ngn <dig> induced endocrine differentiation, visualized by loss of neurod, myt <dig>  hes6- <dig>  pax <dig>  βiii-tubulin, and glucagon expression but, remarkably, without affecting delamination of the ngn3-expressing cells from the gut epithelium. we also show that neurod-induced endocrine development is sensitive to inhibition by notch. lastly, we show that forced expression of myt <dig> partly restores βiii-tubulin expression in notch1icd expressing cells. together, our results demonstrate that notch regulation of pancreatic endocrine development is conserved in chicken, and raises a possibility of notch mediated inhibition of ngn <dig> and neurod protein activity.

RESULTS
the embryonic chicken pancreas expresses pro-endocrine bhlh genes
pancreatic endocrine development in the mouse relies on the pro-endocrine genes ngn <dig> and neurod  <cit>  whose activity is, at least partly, controlled by hes <dig> and notch signaling  <cit> . to determine if these genes are expressed in the chicken pancreas we performed in situ hybridizations on sections of hh st.  <dig>  <cit>   and hh st.  <dig>  chicken pancreas . these timepoints correspond roughly to e <dig> and e <dig> of mouse pancreas development where the epithelium expands and the endocrine and exocrine differentiation peaks, respectively. at hh st.  <dig>  ngn <dig> was expressed in a few scattered cells within the epithelium  while neurod was expressed in clusters of endocrine cells located at the distal part of the dorsal pancreatic bud  as determined by co-staining for nkx <dig> , a marker of pancreatic progenitor cells as well as β-cells, and glucagon expressed by the α-cells . the chicken hes <dig> homologue, formerly known as hairy <dig>  <cit> , now hes <dig> after official nomenclature, was expressed broadly in the pancreatic epithelium at hh st.  <dig>  while hes6- <dig> was expressed in scattered cells within the epithelium . in the hh st.  <dig> pancreas, the overall expression patterns were similar to the hh st.  <dig> pancreas , but we consistently observed that hes <dig> expression levels varied between different regions of the epithelium such that areas with low levels of hes <dig> expression corresponded to regions where ngn <dig> and hes6- <dig> were expressed . to further define the cell types that expressed the four bhlh genes we used immunohistochemical detection of glucagon, amylase, and nkx <dig>  on sections previously subjected to in situ hybridization. we found that regions expressing high levels of hes <dig>  were devoid of glucagon , whereas amylase was readily detectable in hes1-expressing cells . ngn <dig> and hes6- <dig> were both expressed in pancreatic progenitor cells marked by nkx <dig>   <cit> , but absent from glucagon-producing cells . neurod expression was restricted to clusters of endocrine cells  adjacent to the nkx <dig>  positive epithelium . we also analyzed the expression of hes6- <dig> and hes5- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  <cit> , but could not detect any transcripts in the pancreas. lastly, using whole-mount in situ hybridization on micro-dissected hh st.  <dig> chicken pancreas we observed expression of delta <dig>  notch <dig>  and the chicken jagged- <dig> and - <dig> homologs serrate- <dig> and - <dig> , but due to technical limitations we were not able to further define the cell types that expressed these genes.

forced expression of notch ligands induces endocrine differentiation
expression of pro-endocrine and notch pathway genes suggests that notch signaling might regulate endocrine development in the chicken pancreas. if the function of delta <dig> is to signal to adjacent progenitor cells and prevent them from entering the endocrine differentiation program, then forced widespread expression of delta <dig> in the pancreatic epithelium should reduce the number of endocrine cells formed. to test this prediction, we introduced plasmids expressing delta <dig> upstream of an ires-gfp cassette into the endoderm of hh st. 10– <dig> and hh st. 13– <dig> embryos by in ovo endoderm electroporation  <cit>  and assayed pancreatic endocrine differentiation after  <dig> hours  by staining for gfp, insulin, and glucagon . embryos electroporated with an ires-gfp vector lacking the insert served as controls. we found that extensive expression of delta <dig> in both hh st. 10– <dig> and hh st. 13– <dig> embryos resulted in a marked increase in the fraction of gfp-expressing cells that differentiate into endocrine cells, compared to controls . at a first glance this result may seem paradoxical, but we speculate that a cell autonomous dominant negative action of high levels of delta <dig> on notch signaling  <cit>  results in increased endocrine differentiation. support for such a cell autonomous dominant negative effect comes from additional experiments where we introduced either serrate <dig>  or a c-terminally truncated form of serrate <dig>  , lacking signaling activity and previously shown to act in a cell autonomous dominant negative fashion  <cit> . such embryos showed an increase in endocrine differentiation that was comparable to that seen with delta <dig> regardless of whether full-length or truncated serrate <dig> was used , arguing that the differentiation inducing effects seen when over-expressing full-length delta <dig> and serrate <dig> is the result of a cell autonomous inhibition of notch signal reception. similar experiments using a truncated delta <dig> construct  were inconclusive as very few gfp+ cells remained  <dig> hours after electroporation and none were detectable after  <dig> hours. quantitatively, mis-expression of delta <dig> beginning at hh st. 10– <dig> or hh st. 13– <dig> resulted in an increase of the fraction of endocrine gfp+ cells from ~40% to ~75% and from ~20% to ~50%, respectively . in extreme cases pancreas morphology was severely altered with the dorsal pancreas adopting a tubular morphology with the epithelium composed almost exclusively of endocrine cells . notably, forced expression of delta <dig> had no endocrinogenic effect in the prospective duodenum . if the effect of the ligands were a cell-autonomous inhibition of notch signaling then this effect should be blocked by a constitutive activation of the notch pathway in the same cell. to test this, we co-expressed delta <dig> with a constitutively active form of notch <dig>  <cit>  in the chick pancreas by in ovo electroporation. in agreement with this model we found that notch1icd was able to reverse the effect of delta on endocrine differentiation such that most transfected cells were excluded from the endocrine area under these conditions .

to test if ectopic expression of the ligands also induced exocrine differentiation we compared the expression of the exo- and endocrine markers amylase and glucagon, respectively, in control and delta <dig> electroporated chicken pancreata . gfp-expressing cells were evenly distributed throughout the pancreas epithelium, including exocrine and endocrine cells in the control pancreas. in contrast, the majority of the gfp positive cells expressed glucagon and were excluded from the exocrine cells in delta electroporated pancreata. furthermore, the delta1-expressing pancreata were consistently smaller, suggesting that delta <dig> induces precocious endocrine differentiation at the expense of progenitor expansion and later born cell types such as the exocrine.

constitutively active notch <dig> prevents endocrine differentiation and maintains proliferation
the results above suggest that notch signaling inhibits endocrine differentiation in the chicken pancreas and that this inhibitory signal must be terminated before differentiation can occur. to test the effect of a constitutive activation of notch signaling on normal pancreas development we introduced notch1icd  <cit>  by in ovo endoderm electroporation at hh st. 13– <dig> and analyzed endocrine development after  <dig> hours . we found that gfp+ cells in embryos expressing the control vector readily contributed to α- and β-cells as determined by co-localization of gfp with glucagon and insulin , while gfp+ cells in notch1icd-expressing embryos were only rarely found to co-express glucagon or insulin . quantitative analysis revealed that only ~1% of the gfp+ cells in the notch1icd-expressing pancreas were endocrine compared to 8% for control embryos , demonstrating that notch1icd blocks endocrine differentiation also in the chicken pancreas. the few cells we did find co-expressing notch1icd and endocrine markers can be explained by the occasional electroporation of existing endocrine cells at the time of electroporation  <cit> .

in addition to reduced endocrine development we also observed that the morphology of the pancreas anlage in notch1icd-expressing embryos was disturbed compared to control embryos, such that the nkx <dig> + pancreas epithelium appeared expanded and highly folded compared to controls . we hypothesized that the folded epithelium we observed in notch1icd expressing pancreas could be the result of increased proliferation. we therefore analyzed proliferation of the nkx <dig> + pancreas epithelium using a monoclonal antibody against mpm <dig> which is a marker for mitotic cells  <cit> . we found that the fraction of notch1icd-expressing cells in the pancreas epithelium that expressed mpm <dig> was  <dig> -fold higher than for corresponding cells expressing the control plasmid , demonstrating that active notch signaling inhibits differentiation which is coincident with ongoing proliferation of pancreatic epithelial cells. these data lend further support to the notion of notch signaling acting primarily to maintain a progenitor state, rather than inducing an alternative differentiated cell fate  <cit> .

ngn <dig> induced cell cycle withdrawal and differentiation is antagonized by notch1icd
the results described above suggest that notch mediated control of endocrine pancreas development is conserved in chicken. previous results obtained in mice have indicated that notch signaling acts to repress ngn <dig> expression and thereby prevents endocrine differentiation  <cit> . however, it is also possible that notch signaling may additionally act in cells that already have initiated ngn <dig> expression by antagonizing the function of the encoded protein ngn <dig>  <cit> . to test if activated notch could interfere with the ability of ngn <dig> to induce endocrine differentiation we took advantage of the ability of ectopic ngn <dig> to induce endocrine differentiation in the chick endoderm  <cit> . we confirmed that ngn <dig> induced endocrine differentiation in the chick pancreas . most ngn <dig> positive cells were nkx <dig>  negative and pax <dig> positive, suggesting they had differentiated into α-cells . in agreement with this we found that many ngn <dig> positive cells expressed glucagon while insulin-expressing cells were rare . mitotic cells were extremely rare among the ngn3-expressing cells as judged by mpm <dig> immunoreactivity  similar to the situation in mouse where early endocrine cells are post mitotic  <cit> . to test if active notch signaling can prevent ngn3-induced endocrine differentiation in the chick pancreas, we co-electroporated hh st. 13– <dig> embryos with ngn <dig> and notch1icd expression vectors and assayed endocrine development after  <dig> hours. in contrast to embryos electroporated with the ngn <dig> vector alone we found that most co-electroporated cells maintained nkx <dig>  expression  and displayed a high percentage of mpm <dig> expression  whereas very few cells expressed pax <dig>  glucagon or insulin . this result demonstrates that activated notch <dig> can inhibit the function of the ngn <dig> protein.

hes5- <dig> and hes6- <dig> is inversely regulated by ngn <dig> and notch1icd
to begin to unravel the mechanism behind notch-mediated inhibition of endocrine development, we next investigated the expression pattern of hes <dig>  hes5- <dig>  hes6- <dig>  and neurod in the pancreas after introduction of ngn <dig>  notch1icd and ngn <dig> + notch1icd or control vector . the expression pattern of these genes was not affected in embryos electroporated with control vector . conversely, ngn <dig> electroporation led to loss of hes <dig> expression and a robust induction of neurod and hes6- <dig> in the electroporated area . in contrast, notch1icd repressed neurod and hes6- <dig> expression in the electroporated area . notably, we found no evidence to suggest that notch1icd up-regulated hes <dig>  and it even appeared to be down-regulated in the transfected area. instead, hes5- <dig>  another notch target gene  <cit>  not normally expressed in the pancreas epithelium, was strongly induced in notch1icd expressing cells . in the developing nervous system of the mouse, hes <dig> and hes <dig> are expressed in complementary patterns and hes <dig> expression is expanded in the hes <dig> null mice and vice versa indicating mutual cross repression  <cit> . hes <dig> expression is also induced in the endoderm of hes <dig> null mice  <cit> . in the chick embryo hes5- <dig> is known to repress the expression of other chicken hes genes  <cit>  and it is possible that it also respresses hes <dig> under these conditions. similar results were recently reported by matsuda et al. who found that ectopic expression of notch1icd in chick embryonic stomach endoderm failed to up-regulate transcription of hes <dig> and hairy <dig>  two hes homologues normally found to be expressed in this tissue  <cit> . when ngn <dig> and notch1icd were co-electroporated we observed a robust induction of hes5- <dig> expression while ngn3-induced neurod and hes6- <dig> expression was lost . hes <dig> also appeared down-regulated under these conditions.

activated notch <dig> inhibits ngn <dig> and neurod induced endocrine differentiation but not delamination
our finding that notch1icd inhibits both expression and function of ngn <dig> is consistent with previous reports showing that x-notchicd inhibits both the expression and function of the ngn <dig> related x-ngnr- <dig> during xenopus neurogenesis  <cit> . furthermore, since x-ngnr- <dig> can induce xneurod expression while the converse is not the case  <cit>  it appears that a unidirectional bhlh cascade regulates neural determination and differentiation . whether either or both of these processes are repressed by notch signaling is not fully understood. furthermore, it is still unknown whether neurod can induce ngn <dig> expression, and the sensitivity of these bhlh factors to notch mediated inhibition in endocrine development has not previously been investigated. to test if the neurogenin-neurod cascade is unidirectional in endocrine development we compared the effect of introducing ngn <dig> and neurod. we analyzed ngn <dig> expression by in situ hybridization in neurod electroporated cells but found no evidence to suggest that neurod induce ngn <dig> expression , consistent with similar studies in the nervous system  <cit>  and indicating that neurod activates the differentiation program independent of ngn <dig>  however, we cannot exclude a transient induction of ngn <dig> at earlier timepoints not analyzed. next we examined if notch1icd could block the differentiation induced by ngn <dig> or neurod by performing co-electroporation experiments . in these experiments we targeted the prospective duodenum where no endocrine development occurs at the stages examined unless ngn <dig> is induced and where delamination of differentiating endocrine cells is more readily scored  <cit> . we used an antibody to laminin to visualize the basal lamina of the endodermal epithelium and pax <dig>  glucagon, somatostatin and neuronal classiii β-tubulin  <cit>  specific antibodies as endocrine markers. in our experiments both ngn <dig> and neurod induced endocrine differentiation as evidenced by pax6-, glucagon-, somatostatin-, and neuronal classiii β-tubulin expression and delamination of the differentiated cells . however, when notch1icd was co-expressed with either ngn <dig> or neurod we found an almost complete loss of all these endocrine markers , showing that during forced endocrine differentiation both ngn <dig> and neurod function is sensitive to notch. delamination of ngn <dig> and neurod expressing cells still occurred under these conditions , showing that delamination and expression of differentiation markers can be uncoupled during endocrine development.

myt <dig> can partially antagonize the effects of notch1icd on ngn <dig> function
the above experiments demonstrate that activated notch <dig> can inhibit both ngn3- and neurod-induced endocrine development. since certain ngn3-induced gene products, such as hes6- <dig> and myt <dig>  have been reported to attenuate notch mediated inhibition  <cit>  we wanted to analyze if expression of any of these genes was insensitive to notch inhibition in the duodenum, thus possibly explaining the delamination observed in the presence of activated notch. as mentioned above , both native and ngn3-induced neurod and hes6- <dig> expression in the pancreas is sensitive to notch inhibition but delamination is not readily scored in the pancreas due to the branching of the epithelium. we therefore repeated the experiment in the duodenum and found that ngn3-induced expression of these two genes as well as myt <dig> was repressed by notch1icd also at that location . this result suggests that ngn <dig> can initiate a delamination program independent of the activity of these genes and that ngn <dig> may have actions insensitive to notch repression.

the levels of notch1icd resulting from forced expression are likely much higher than found during native notch signaling events. our experiments therefore do not rule out that hes6- <dig> and/or myt <dig> could render cells refractive to the action of more physiological levels of notch as seen in neurogenesis  <cit> . to test if forced expression of myt <dig> at high levels could antagonize notch1icd function we electroporated chicken endoderm with constructs encoding ngn <dig>  notch1icd and a flag tagged nzf2b isoform of myt <dig>  this is one of two myt <dig> isoforms resulting from alternative transcriptional start sites reported to be expressed at highest levels in the mouse pancreas. furthermore, it is the only isoform capable of initiating the endocrine differentiation program in the chicken endoderm  <cit> . we found that expression of myt <dig> led to a partial restoration of neuronal classiii β-tubulin expression , indicating that some aspects of endocrine differentiation have been rescued in these cells. expression of pax <dig>  glucagon and somatostatin was, however, not restored under these conditions , suggesting that other factors are needed to overcome the repression by notch1icd.

discussion
the pancreatic expression of bhlh genes and their sensitivity to notch mediated inhibition observed in this study suggests that endocrine development is highly conserved between mice and chicken.

overexpression of notch ligands leads to endocrine differentiation
the observed stimulatory effect of delta <dig> over-expression upon endocrine differentiation is in contrast to the effect of delta <dig> over-expression in the chicken retina where widespread rcas-mediated expression of delta <dig> inhibits neuronal differentiation  <cit> , and seemingly at odds with the proposed function of delta <dig> as a signal that inhibits endocrine differentiation. however, high level expression of notch ligands has previously been reported by a number of groups to result in cell autonomous inhibition of notch signal reception  <cit> , raising the possibility that the effect we observe is cell autonomous and the result of inhibition of notch signaling rather than stimulation of notch signaling in neighboring cells. in our experiments we used plasmid-based electroporation which results in multiple copies being taken up by the electroporated cells which combined with the very strong promoter used may result in expression levels exceeding those obtained by henrique and colleagues who used an rcas retrovirus-mediated delivery  <cit> . furthermore, expression of a truncated signaling-defective version of serrate- <dig> also resulted in enhanced endocrine development, arguing that the effects we observe with full-length delta <dig> and serrate- <dig> is the result of a dominant negative effect. this was further corroborated by the ability of notch1icd to reverse the effect of the ligands in a cell autonomous manner. however, in spite of the cell-autonomous effect on notch signal reception, we would expect that cells lying adjacent to cells expressing delta <dig> or serrate <dig> would be prevented from differentiating through the non-cell autonomous activation of notch signaling in neighboring cells, while this effect should not be observed for cells lying next to serrate-d1-expressing cells which are signaling defective. however, since differentiating endocrine cells delaminate from the epithelium we were not able to ascertain whether differentiation of cells initially lying adjacent to delta1- or serrate1-expressing cells was delayed or inhibited.

it is noteworthy that we always observe that a fraction of the ligand expressing cells fail to undergo endocrine differentiation and that this fraction increases with time. one possible explanation for this is that these cells are differentiating into acinar cells as premature acinar differentiation is observed in zebrafish with compromised notch signaling  <cit> ; however, we found no evidence to suggest that amylase expression occurred prematurely. it is also possible that such cells are committed to a non-endocrine fate and that inhibition of notch signaling therefore cannot induce endocrine differentiation. in this regard it is notable that forced expression of ngn <dig> also fails to induce endocrine differentiation of all the cells that express the introduced gene. however, a trivial explanation may be that the cells that fail to differentiate express the introduced genes at levels that are incompatible with endocrine differentiation.

the endocrinogenic effect of notch ligand expression was confined to the pancreatic endoderm. in spite of widespread expression in prospective duodenum we found no signs of endocrine development. this is most likely due to the restriction of ngn <dig> expression to the pancreas anlage at this stage, but apparently contrasts with recent data from gu and colleagues who found that forced expression of manic fringe in prospective duodenum led to endocrine development through inhibition of notch signaling  <cit> . the reason for this discrepancy is unclear at present but could be related to the different mechanisms by which manic fringe and high levels of delta <dig> inhibits notch signal reception.

activated notch inhibits endocrine promoting ngn <dig> activity
previous studies of notch function in pancreatic endocrine development have not considered a potential role for notch mediated inhibition of ngn <dig> and/or neurod protein function. several examples of post-translational inhibition of pro-neural function by notch have been described in the literature. the function of the exocrine bhlh factor p48-ptf <dig> has been shown to be inhibited via heterodimerization to hes <dig>  <cit> . in drosophila, several notch target genes of the e class have been shown to dimerize with pro-neural bhlh factors and antagonize the function of these  <cit> , in xenopus x-ngn <dig> function can be antagonized by activated notch <dig>  <cit> , and in human cell lines notch signaling has been demonstrated to lead to a rapid degradation of the human achaete-scute homolog hash <dig>  <cit> . it is possible that similar mechanisms regulate ngn <dig> function. it is also possible that regulatory sequences of genes induced by ngn <dig> also contain hes binding sites and that hes repressor activity is dominant over ngn <dig>  although our results do not prove that notch signaling is active in ngn3-expressing precursors they do raise the possibility that notch might have a second effect in endocrine differentiation in that it could regulate the levels and duration of ngn <dig> activity. a similar but not identical experiment has been conducted by murtaugh and colleagues who used ngn3-cre mice to conditionally mix-express notch1icd in endocrine progenitor cells which led to inhibition of endocrine differentiation  <cit> . however, since ngn <dig> expression was not investigated in that study it is unclear whether this block in endocrine development was caused by inhibition of ngn <dig> gene expression or ngn <dig> protein activity. recently, notch1icd was shown to re-direct endocrine progenitors to a duct cell fate when expression was induced in pax4-expressing cells  <cit> . presumably, this effect would require inhibition of ngn <dig> as pax <dig> is a target of ngn <dig> 

a surprising finding is that activated notch did not result in significant upregulation of hes <dig> in the pancreas but rather appeared to repress the expression of this notch effector gene. as discussed above this may be a secondary effect to the induction of hes5- <dig>  in a transgenic mouse expressing notch1icd under the pdx <dig> promoter, hes <dig> protein could not be detected in most of the notch1icd expressing pancreatic cells even though ngn <dig> expression was almost completely abolished throughout the epithelium <cit> . it was speculated that the hes <dig> protein is expressed at levels too low for detection by immunohistochemistry. an alternative interpretation is that the effect of notch1icd is mediated by other hes factors such as hes <dig>  or that notch signaling may be required but not sufficient for hes <dig> expression under normal circumstances.

surprisingly, ngn3-induced delamination still occurred in the presence of notch1icd. the molecular mechanism controlling delamination of endocrine cells is poorly defined but it is possible that ngn3-targets responsible for delamination are less sensitive to notch-mediated repression than targets genes involved in endocrine differentiation, e.g., if genes required for delamination lack hes binding sites in their regulatory elements. intriguingly, differentiation and delamination is also uncoupled in other circumstances. a mutant ngn <dig> protein carrying a missense mutation  is hypomorphic in regard to endocrine-inducing activity, but still capable of inducing delamination to the same extent as wild-type ngn <dig>  <cit> .

activated notch antagonize ngn <dig> as well as neurod function
conditional expression of notch1icd in mature insulin-producing beta cells has no apparent effect on the beta cell phenotype  <cit> . since neurod function is required for beta cell survival and function  <cit>  we speculated that neurod might be refractive to the effects of activated notch. however, endocrine differentiation induced by forced neurod expression in chicken endoderm was completely prevented by co-expression of notch1icd. this could reflect a mechanistic change in neurod function in mature endocrine cells compared to precursor cells. in agreement with this notion we found that a few endocrine cells in the pancreas expressed notch1icd probably reflecting the occasional transfection of existing endocrine cells at the time of electroporation. alternatively, it is possible that the rosa <dig> locus, used to conditionally express notch1icd by murtaugh and colleagues, results in appreciably lower levels of expression than we obtain by electroporation and that high level expression of notch1icd is required for repression of neurod function. neurod is also capable of inducing neurogenesis when expressed in xenopus ectoderm  <cit>  but it is unclear if activated notch can inhibit this function of neurod. in one study, x-ngnr- <dig> and xneurod were equally sensitive to inhibition by x-notchicd in side-by-side comparisons  <cit> , while in another study the number of neurons formed in response to x-ngnr- <dig> was reduced by x-notchicdwhich was not the case for xneurod induced neurons  <cit> . a number of observations support a similar function in pancreatic endocrine development; forced expression of either ngn <dig> or neurod in the pancreas can induce the endocrine differentiation program  <cit>  and ngn <dig> induces neurod expression  <cit> , while neurod cannot induce ngn <dig> expression  suggesting that a unidirectional bhlh cascade may also regulate endocrine determination and differentiation.

myt <dig> antagonism of notch1icd activity
during xenopus neurogenesis myt <dig> can in cooperation with x-ngnr- <dig> overcome the repressive activity of notch upon x-ngnr- <dig>  <cit> . we observe only a partial antagonistic effect of myt <dig> on notch mediated repression of ngn <dig> function. the reasons for this incomplete rescue is unclear but it is possible that the chicken electroporation system results in far higher levels of activated notch than seen with mrna injection in xenopus oocytes. it is possible that myt <dig> would have a greater effect if more physiological expression levels were used. nevertheless, the expression of known notch signaling modifiers such as hes6- <dig>  myt <dig>  and manic fringe in endocrine precursors  <cit>  suggests that notch signaling is finely regulated during the early stages of endocrine differentiation. however, conditional loss-of-function studies in mice are needed to further elucidate the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of notch signaling during these early stages of endocrine development.

CONCLUSIONS
together the data presented here establish that pancreatic endocrine development in the chicken relies in a conserved bhlh cascade under inhibitory control of notch signaling. while this may not be surprising it does lay the ground for further studies that take advantage of the ease at which chicken embryos can be manipulated.

our results also raise the possibility that notch could act in ngn3-expressing cells and delay their differentiation. to determine whether notch in fact does act upon ngn <dig> in vivo will require sophisticated conditional mutagenesis.

lastly, our results demonstrate that expression of differentiation markers can be uncoupled from the process of delamination of differentiating cells from the epithelium.
