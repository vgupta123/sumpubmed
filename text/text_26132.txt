BACKGROUND
comparative mapping is a powerful tool to transfer genomic information from sequenced genomes to closely related species for which whole genome sequence data are not yet available. such an approach was initially demonstrated by fujiyama et al.  <cit>  for the construction of the human-chimpanzee comparative map. in these closely related primate species, approximately 98% of chimpanzee bac end sequences  had significant blast hits to the human genome sequence allowing putative orthologues to be identified  <cit> . a similar approach was used for the construction of the human-mouse comparative map  <cit> . subsequently, this approach was extensively used in mammals including construction of the human-cattle, the human-horse, and the human-porcine comparative maps  <cit> . most recently, this approach was utilized one step further for the construction of the comparative genome contig -based physical map of the sheep genome  <cit> , where cgc is established based on anchorage of the sheep bes onto the genome sequences of dog, cow, and human. these successes depended on high percentage of blast hits and/or high levels of genome collinearity.

five teleost fish genomes have been fully sequenced http://www.ensembl.org/index.html including zebrafish , japanese pufferfish , green spotted pufferfish , medaka , and three-spined stickleback , while whole genome sequencing is also underway for tilapia http://www.cichidgenome.org; http://www.broad.mit.edu/science/projects/mammals-models/vertebrates-invertebrates/tilapia/tilapia-genome-sequencing-project. the availability of these whole genome sequences lends great opportunities for comparative genome analysis. recently, major genomic resources have been developed from a number of fish species such as atlantic salmon   <cit> , rainbow trout   <cit> , tilapia  <cit> , gilthead sea bream   <cit> , european sea bass   <cit> , and channel catfish  .

catfish is the major aquaculture species in the united states. it is one of the six species included in the u.s. national animal genome project nrsp- <dig>  a number of genome resources have been developed in catfish including a large number of molecular markers  <cit> , genetic linkage maps  <cit> , several hundred thousands of ests , microarray platforms  <cit> , bac libraries  <cit> , and bac-based physical maps  <cit> . to enable bac end sequence-based comparative genome analysis, we previously reported generation of  <dig>  bes in catfish  <cit> . in spite of the great value of those bes for the characterization of genome repeat structures  <cit>  and for the identification of microsatellite markers, our previous comparative genome analysis using bes revealed very limited conservation between the catfish and zebrafish genomes. of the  <dig> mate-paired bes with genes on both ends of the bac inserts, only  <dig>  were found in nearby genomic locations in the zebrafish genome, suggesting high levels of chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> . such findings were in strong contrast to the situations found between medaka-sea bream, tetraodon-sea bream, medaka-stickleback, tetraodon-medaka, stickleback-sea bream, tetraodon-stickleback genome comparisons where almost complete genome collinearities were found  <cit> . we speculated that our earlier inability to discover large extent of genome collinearity between catfish and zebrafish could be a result of the low numbers of bes and the lack of a physical map. therefore, in this study, we extended our efforts in bac end sequencing and generated additional  <dig>  bes, bringing the total to  <dig>  . using these catfish bes and its bac contig-based physical map  <cit> , genetic linkage mapping of bac end-anchored microsatellites, and the genome sequence of zebrafish, here we conducted extensive comparative genome analysis. we report the identification of conserved syntenies and demonstrate the construction of super scaffolds of contigs by genetic linkage mapping of bac end-associated microsatellites.

RESULTS
bac end sequencing
as shown in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  bac inserts  were sequenced from both ends, resulting in  <dig>  bes â‰¥  <dig> bp in length , including  <dig>  bes we previously reported  <cit> . mate-paired bes were produced from  <dig>  bac clones, while only a single bes was obtained from  <dig>  clones. the bes were of high quality as the q <dig> length ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, with an average q <dig> read length of  <dig> bp. all these bes have been deposited into the genbank gss database with consecutive accession numbers of . a total of  <dig> , <dig> bp of genomic sequences was generated from this study, representing approximately 4% of the catfish genome. analysis using the  <dig> , <dig> bp bes resulted in  <dig> % of base pairs masked using the danio repeat database, with the most abundant type of repeat being the dna transposons. we previously reported the assessment of repetitive elements in the catfish genome and the additional  <dig>  bes generated in this study confirmed our previous findings in general  <cit> . these bes  were also used for comparative genome analysis in this study.

in silico analysis of the bac-associated catfish genes on the zebrafish genome
tblastx searches using the  <dig>  catfish bes against the ensembl zebrafish cdna database with chromosome information resulted in  <dig>  significant hits . of the  <dig>  significant hits,  <dig>  unique zebrafish genes were hit by a single bes while  <dig>  unique zebrafish genes were hit by two or more catfish bes, making a total of  <dig>  unique zebrafish genes with significant hits from the catfish bes. the  <dig>  genes cover all  <dig> zebrafish chromosomes, with the largest number of gene hits being located on chromosome  <dig> , followed by chromosome  <dig> , chromosome  <dig> , chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig> ; and the smallest number of gene hits on chromosome  <dig> with  <dig> hits . the number of gene hits on various chromosomes was approximately proportional to the sizes of the zebrafish chromosomes with some exceptions. when the size of chromosomes was taken into consideration, chromosome  <dig> had the largest number of gene hits with  <dig>  hits per mb or one hit per  <dig> kb on average, followed by chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  hits per mb, respectively .

*: annotated genes only from ensembl.

one particular finding of these blast searches is the observation of many highly repetitive genes. out of  <dig>  unique genes,  <dig>  genes had hits from two or more bes. a single gene identity had hits from as many as  <dig> bes. a total of  <dig> genes had hits from at least  <dig> bes each ; an additional  <dig> genes had hits from 4- <dig> bes each;  <dig> genes had hits from  <dig> bes each, and  <dig> genes had hits from  <dig> bes each . some of the genes with hits from multiple bes may represent a whole array of related genes with similar functional domains. for instance,  <dig> bes hit nod3-like gene of channel catfish, which was just recently characterized; nod <dig> gene existed as a single copy gene in the catfish genome  <cit> , and apparently the multiple bes contained many related genes harboring domains present within the nod <dig> gene. theoretically, a fraction of genes should have hits by more than one bes, simply because of the genome coverage of the bac clones. we believe that overlapping  bac clones does account for some of the observed hits of genes by more than one bes , especially for those with 2- <dig> bes hits. however, the mathematical chances do not support multiple bes hits of a single gene unless the gene itself is repetitive in the catfish genome. additional research is warranted to fully understand the nature of these genes/sequences in the catfish genome, but clearly many of these represent classes of repetitive gene families such as dna polymerase gene that had hits from  <dig> bes.

establishing microsyntenies
among the teleost genomes with high sequence coverage, zebrafish is the most closely related species to catfish  <cit> . our initial blast searches of the catfish bes against the genome of the t. nigroviridis generated many fewer significant hits compared to those against the zebrafish genome. therefore, we concentrated our comparative analysis efforts with the zebrafish genome in this study.

conserved syntenies are most often established by comparing genome sequences of related species. however, the whole genome sequence is not yet available from catfish. in the absence of the whole genome sequence, we attempted to establish microsyntenies based on physical linkage of gene sequences. with the genome resources available in catfish, we have taken three approaches. first, if the genes were identified from both ends of a single bac clone, they are physically linked with a distance of the bac clone insert size. if the same two genes are found linked in the zebrafish genome in the same genome neighborhood, a microsynteny can then be established. these genes from mate-paired bes are physically linked with the average distances between them being the average insert size of the catfish bac library, i.e.,  <dig> kb. from the  <dig>  bes, a total of  <dig>  mate-paired bes were identified. of these,  <dig> mate-paired bes had significant blastn hits against the zebrafish genome sequence. however, only  <dig> of the  <dig> significant hit pairs were on the same zebrafish chromosome, allowing syntenic comparison. further tblastx searches against the ensembl zebrafish cdna database allowed identification of  <dig> mate-paired bes with genes on both sides. the genomic locations of these  <dig> mate-paired genes were determined from the zebrafish genome sequence. fifty pairs were found to be present in neighboring genomic locations within one million base pairs, while the other  <dig> were present in more distant locations  on the same chromosomes. the vast majority of the  <dig> mate-paired genes were found to be within  <dig> kb on the zebrafish genome sequence; only  <dig> of the  <dig> pairs had a distance of 500- <dig> kb , suggesting conserved syntenies of the involved genes.

catfish
we previously reported the relatively high levels of local region conservation. for instance, many genes within the bordering mate-paired genes were well conserved among catfish, zebrafish, and tetraodon, as determined by direct sequencing of the catfish bac dna using primers predicted from known genes in zebrafish or tetraodon  <cit> . we did not extend this part of the study, but all known genomic information suggested high levels of local genome conservation.

in addition to the  <dig> microsyntenies, we attempted to determine if significant gene hits in the same catfish bac contigs also fall on the same chromosome locations comparable to the contig sizes. as shown in table  <dig>  of the contigs with gene hits,  <dig>  contigs had only one gene hit, while  <dig> contigs had two or more gene hits within each contig. because the genes in the same contig are physically linked, their linkage in a comparable distance in the zebrafish genome would indicate a conserved synteny. as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> & <dig>  the vast majority of gene hits within the same contigs were found to be located on the same zebrafish chromosomes with comparable distances as estimated from the catfish bac contigs. using such an approach, a total of  <dig> conserved microsyntenies was identified . presence of multiple gene hits within large bac contigs would allow identification of extended large conserved syntenic regions. many of the microsyntenies were conserved with extended genomic distance to span over several million base pairs . for instance, large conserved syntenies were identified from chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . in spite of the identification of some relatively large conserved syntenic regions, the vast majority of the identified syntenies were microsyntenies. such highly segmented microsyntenies are not very useful for genome-wide comparative analysis. however, if scaffolds can be established by determining the relationships among the microsyntenies, large-scale genome comparison should be possible. we, therefore, used two zebrafish chromosomes as the query to demonstrate if super scaffolds can be established. chromosome  <dig>  one of the chromosomes with the highest number of significant gene hits, and chromosome  <dig>  one of the chromosomes with a large number of contigs having two or more hits , were chosen for further analysis using genetic linkage mapping.

genetic mapping of bac end-anchored microsatellites
in order to extend the scope of conserved microsyntenies, microsyntenies identified on zebrafish chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were genetically mapped to determine their chromosomal locations in the catfish genome. there were  <dig> significant blastn hits to zebrafish chromosome  <dig> involving  <dig> unique catfish bac contigs; and  <dig> significant hits to zebrafish chromosome  <dig> involving  <dig> unique catfish bac contigs. we, therefore, first identified microsatellites from these involved catfish bac contigs, and then mapped them to the linkage groups when the microsatellites were polymorphic in the resource family. a total of  <dig> pairs of microsatellite primers were tested, of which  <dig> from  <dig> contigs  were polymorphic in the resource family. further analysis using joinmap  <dig>  allowed mapping of  <dig> microsatellite markers, of which  <dig> microsatellites were from bes with significant similarity to zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig> microsatellites were from bes with significant similarity to zebrafish chromosome  <dig> 

mapping of microsatellites from contigs with hits to zebrafish chromosome  <dig> allowed identification of a highly conserved chromosome between catfish and zebrafish. as shown in figure  <dig>  of the  <dig> microsatellites from bes with high similarities to the zebrafish chromosome  <dig>   <dig> microsatellites from  <dig> contigs were mapped into a single linkage group, spanning approximately  <dig> centi-morgans, suggesting the conservation of a large segment of this chromosome. however, the entire chromosome is not conserved. the  <dig> microsatellites were mapped to a total of  <dig> linkage groups, with seven of the  <dig> linkage groups containing 4- <dig> markers .

similarly but to a much lesser extent, microsatellites from bes with similarities to the zebrafish chromosome  <dig> were mapped to three major linkage groups . once again, many smaller syntenic regions were mapped to various linkage groups, suggesting high levels of local conservation and low levels of chromosomal conservation. nonetheless, the significant aspect of this is that scaffolds can be established by linking various contigs together through linkage mapping. this will allow integration of genetic linkage and physical maps once microsatellites are identified from most contigs of the physical map. such scaffolds should guide genome sequence assembly in the future, and should also provide molecular length measurements of various polymorphic markers along the genome of catfish, providing guidance for the development of the snp chip technology in catfish. apparently, snp chips constructed from evenly distributed snps provide the best coverage of the catfish genome when conducting the whole genome association studies.

genetic linkage mapping of bac end-anchored microsatellites provided a level of validation of the physical map. discrepancies were found between the bac assemblage and the linkage map. of the  <dig> contigs with at least  <dig> markers,  <dig> contigs were mapped properly into the same linkage groups. however,  <dig> contigs were mapped into different linkage groups . of these  <dig> contigs,  <dig> are large contigs with at least  <dig> bacs. apparently, such discrepancy is indicative of mistakes in the bac assemblage. mapping additional bac end-anchored microsatellites is under way to integrate the genetic linkage and physical maps, and to correct any additional mistakes in the assembly of the physical map  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
some highly conserved chromosomes or chromosomal regions exist between catfish and zebrafish. high levels of local conservation were found, but a high level of chromosomal shuffling and rearrangements exists between catfish and zebrafish genomes. comparative genome analysis using zebrafish genome sequence is highly useful for regional comparisons, but not so useful at the chromosomal levels. the significance of comparative genome analysis in catfish is that it will allow more cost-effective structural genomic analysis, but more importantly, orthologues established through comparative genome analysis should facilitate functional assignment of genes. given that functional genomics is more difficult with non-model fish species, inference from orthologues should be one of the most efficient and reliable approaches for functional analysis of the catfish genome.

overall, the evolutionary syntenic conservation appeared to be relatively low between the catfish genome and the genomes of the zebrafish. this indicates many chromosome breakage and rearrangements among the fish genomes occurred during evolution. these findings are consistent with our previous findings that high levels of conservation were found within small genomic regions, whereas high levels of large-scale genome reshuffling were evident when comparing the genomes of catfish and zebrafish  <cit> . these conclusions, however, are based on the assumption that the zebrafish genome assembly is correct. apparently, due to the assembly mistakes in the zebrafish genome, some of the syntenic breaks may be due to the still poor assembly of the zebrafish genome. we also acknowledge that comparative genome analysis using a partial bank of sequences in catfish and a more complete databank in zebrafish could potentially lead to a bias. caution should be exercised when establishing concrete syntenic relations. such limitations themselves justify the need for whole genome sequencing in catfish.
