BACKGROUND
appropriate t- and b-cell migration and timely interaction with antigen presenting cells  are essential for the development of humoral immune responses  <cit> . specialized compartments within lymphoid tissues facilitate these interactions  <cit> . distinct populations of b-cells reside in these microenvironments, and, upon antigen stimulation, cells with appropriate antigen receptors differentiate and migrate among these compartments for a proper immunological reaction  <cit> . the initiation of a t-dependent b-cell response results from cognate interaction between a t-helper cell and a b-cell that primes the b-cell into two developmental pathways. an extrafollicular reaction takes place in the t zone and leads to the production of plasma cells with unmutated immunoglobulin  genes. the other pathway initiates a germinal center  reaction, whereby activated b lymphocytes originating from extrafollicular foci enter the gc and undergo a stringent process of positive selection and affinity maturation. the selected cells differentiate into either memory b-cells or plasma cells with mutated ig genes. the gc provides the important microenvironment for this crucial b-cell maturational process  <cit> .

in follicles with developing gcs, the resting b-cells that are not the part of the gc response are pushed outward to form the mantle zone  or corona around the gc b-cells. the mantle cell is a pre-gc, immunologically naïve b-cell that is also the putative cell of origin of mantle cell lymphoma  <cit> . these b-cells express unmutated immunoglobulin genes, sigdhigh, cd27-  <cit>  and are mostly restricted to the follicular mantle zone  <cit> . in the human spleen, there is a well defined zone between the follicular b-cells and the red pulp called the marginal zone  containing marginal-zone macrophages, granulocytes and dendritic cells that are specialized to capture blood-borne antigens and present them to the resident marginal zone b-cells  <cit> . unlike primary lymphoid follicles in spleen and lymph nodes, which contain mostly mature recirculating b-cells, non-recirculating b-cells are enriched in the splenic mgz. these cells are specially adapted to respond rapidly to t-independent  antigens and have a lower threshold than recirculating or immature b-cells for activation, proliferation and differentiation into antibody-secreting cells  <cit> . they may therefore provide the early rapid humoral response prior to the more refined but delayed response from the gc reaction. most adult human mgz b-cells have the igmhigh, igdlow and cd27+ phenotype, suggesting that this zone contains mainly memory b-cells  <cit> .

many previous studies  <cit>  have provided important information concerning the biology of the gc. while morphology and immunophenotype are useful in defining the various b-cell compartments of peripheral lymphoid organs, the molecular signals that affect the life span, survival, retention, migration and functions of the cells in these compartments have not been widely investigated.

we used the lymphochip cdna microarray  <cit>  to investigate the differences in gene expression profiles in the three different b-cell compartments, the mnz with mostly naïve b-cells, the mgz containing memory b-cells  <cit>  and specialized non-recirculating b-cells and the gc with a mixture of highly proliferative centroblasts and more differentiated and non-dividing centrocytes. for this study, we used both tissue compartments isolated by laser capture microdissection  and naïve and memory b-cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting . the microdissected samples contained the dominant b-cell population in each compartment as well as other cell populations in the physiological microenvironment, whereas the facs-sorted cells contained more uniform b-cell subsets. by comparing facs-sorted cells with the corresponding compartment from lcm, we have identified a stromal cell gene expression signature that may provide insight into stromal/b-cell interaction.

RESULTS
isolation of naïve and memory b-cells and different anatomic b-cell compartments
gc and mnz could be readily dissected from tonsillar frozen sections, but mgz could only be reliably obtained from the spleen . immunostaining was not applied on the sections to be microdissected because it was difficult to obtain cells from sections on charged slides and because immunostaining also led to a marked loss of amplifiable rna from the sections, even when a rapid procedure was used  <cit> . hence, immunostaining was performed on a consecutive section to guide the dissection. immunostaining by us and others has shown that the mnz contained over 90% b-cells, which are the igd+ cd27-, similar to facs-sorted naïve b-cells. the gc was easily recognizable and generally contained a higher percentage of non b-cells, including t-cells, macrophages and follicular dendritic cells . the mgz was obtained from a spleen with a morphologically clearly defined mgz containing mostly igm+ cd27+ b-cells, corresponding to the phenotype of facs-sorted memory b-cells  <cit> . the mgz also contained scattered t-cells and has been shown by others to contain specialized macrophages and fibroblasts  <cit> . the facs-sorted populations were over 90% pure, according to post-sort immunophenotyping .

gene expression profiling analytical approach
fifteen data sets corresponding to the five sample groups were generated. different hybridizations were correlated through a correlation matrix plot, and replicated hybridizations were shown to be closely related . the plots allowed us to check reproducibility of the microarray assay among different samples of each tissue . the number of genes showing differential expression between two compartments and the magnitude of difference calculated by t-statistics were further filtered by significance analysis of microarrays  approach, as described previously  <cit> . on the lymphochip, over 20% of the genes are represented by multiple clones, and, generally, several clones of same genes are selected by our analytical algorithm. the differentially expressed genes among the three compartments identified by sam were grouped according to their major functional attributes and then viewed through tree view.

confirmation of the microarray analysis with semi-quantitative rt-pcr and with real time quantitative pcr
the differential expression of some of the transcripts that had no previously reported association with any of the compartments was further validated by a semi-quantitative rt-pcr. no discrepancies were found with any of the selected genes. by pcr analysis, some of the transcripts had almost exclusive expression in one compartment: ark <dig> in gc, ccl <dig> in mnz and cmrf-35h in mgz. other transcripts were expressed in all compartments with a relatively high differential expression in one, such as set and faim in gc, cyclin g <dig> in mnz, and nm23-h <dig> and card <dig> in mgz .

some of the results of the semi-quantitative rt-pcr were further validated by the sybr® green real-time quantitative pcr . the results corresponded well with both microarray and semi-quantitative rt-pcr.

gene expression characteristics in anatomic b-cell compartments
genes controlling cell proliferation and quiescence 
comparing the gene expression profiles of lcm gc and facs-sorted gc b-cells  <cit>  revealed that the gc b-cell signature was largely represented in the microdissected gc profile. the gc gene expression profile was dominated by the increased expression of genes associated with proliferation , kinetochore association , functional components of mitotic checkpoints  and regulators of cell-cycle related events, including centrosome separation/segregation and cytokinesis , as expected from the known high proliferation rate of centroblasts. gc also highly expressed genes involved in dna repair , as expected from the frequent physiological double-strand dna breaks associated with somatic hypermutation and isotype switching. the gc profile also showed increased levels of transcripts involved in dna replication  and in transcription and translation .

the low expression of the cyclins ccna, ccnb1and ccnf and of cdc <dig>  is consistent with the resting state of the mnz and mgz b-cells. characteristically ccna expression is very low in go phase and begins to increase in early g <dig>  for the cell to enter the g2/m phase, an association with cdc <dig> is required  <cit> . the transition requires ccnb <dig> to form a complex with cdc <dig> and relocate to the nucleus. this nuclear localization is mediated by ccnf  <cit> . however, mnz and mgz b-cells may also employ different mechanisms in maintaining quiescence. cyclin g <dig>  was highly expressed in mnz cells as compared to either gc or mgz. the function of ccng <dig> differs from the conventional cyclins in negatively regulating the cell cycle  <cit> . studies on hela cells have showed that dna damage induces the production of cyclin g <dig>  which then arrests the cell cycle at the g1/s boundary, and this function is independent of p <dig>  cyclin g <dig> can directly interact with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2a  and prevent cell cycle progression. the low expression of card <dig> in mnz may also be part of the program in maintaining the quiescent state. card <dig> has been shown to be critical for immune receptor signaling of both t and b-cells through the activation of jnk and nf-κb  <cit> . the increased transcriptional level of cd <dig> may be involved in maintaining the quiescent state in mnz b-cells. cd <dig> contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif  in its cytoplasmic domain and functions as a negative regulator of b-cell signaling  <cit> . interestingly, many genes associated with proliferation were expressed at even lower levels in mgz than in mnz cells. these cells highly expressed growth inhibitory genes such as cmrf-35h  <cit> , cbl-b  <cit> , and gas <dig>  <cit> , which may contribute to the quiescent state in mgz b-cells.

apoptosis 
the markedly decreased bcl <dig> expression in gc b-cells makes them vulnerable to undergo apoptosis unless rescued by survival signals  <cit> . an increase in the expression of proapoptotic genes e.g. bik, fasl and pdcd <dig>  suggests a further increase in susceptibility to apoptosis in the gc. however, faim is overexpressed in the gc and may represent a protective mechanism in gc b-cells that have appropriate bcr signaling and cd40l stimulation with resultant upregulation of faim and increased resistance to fasl-mediated apoptosis  <cit> . presumably, gc b-cells with sig having poor antigen affinity will be ineffective in activating faim. in addition, a tnf receptor family member  which promotes the b-cell survival  <cit>  showed increased transcription in the gc. programmed cell death  <dig> , which functions mainly as an inhibitor of translation by inhibiting the activity of eif4a helicase, which helps to unwind the 5' end of mrnas, was markedly repressed in the gc b-cells  <cit> . this suggests that pdcd <dig> repression facilitates the rapid proliferation of centroblasts, which requires a high rate of protein synthesis. both mnz and mgz had higher expression of bcl <dig>  but have different profiles of other apoptosis/survival genes that may represent specific adaptation of these cells to their unique physiological states and microenvironment. the expression of bnip <dig>  encoding a proapoptotic protein of the bcl <dig> family <cit> , is markedly down regulated in mgz cells, perhaps providing additional protection against apoptosis in memory b-cells. on the other hand, tcl <dig> was upregulated in mnz only and may have an antiapoptotic role in that population.

there was increased expression of suppressor of death domains  in mgz cells, suggesting a complex regulation of signaling through the tnfr superfamily. sodd is associated with tnfr <dig> in vivo, maintaining the receptor in an inactive monomeric state. the release of sodd from tnfr <dig> permits the recruitment of proteins such as tradd and traf <dig> to the activated tnfr <dig> signaling complex  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that tnf-induced activation of nf-κb is accelerated in sodd-deficient cells. the high expression of sodd may be a major mechanism to dampen tnfr <dig> signaling in mgz b-cells in the resting state. the higher expression of card <dig> in mgz may have a pro-survival function, but it may also have a role in mgz organization. it has been shown that loss of card <dig> in mice resulted in the complete loss of cd5+ peritoneal cells and reduced number of igd high igm low mature splenic b-cells, indicating its role in b-cell development  <cit> . two closely related genes, nm23-h <dig> and nm23-h <dig>  which share an amino acid identity of 88%, were highly expressed in mgz. nm <dig> h <dig> is a granzyme a-activated dnase  that is inhibited by set  <cit> . the high expression of nm23-h <dig> and the low expression of its inhibitor set was opposite in their expression profile in the gc, suggesting that this expression may influence apoptosis in opposite directions in these two b-cell compartments.

chemokines, cytokines and their receptors 
chemokines attract primary b-cells and play an important role in the homing and localization of b-cell subsets at different stages of antigen-independent and dependent reaction  <cit> . our microarray data revealed that ccl <dig>  encoding a chemokine secreted by immature dendritic cells , is specifically upregulated in the gc compartment. our finding was supported by a recent report showing that ccl <dig> is produced by gc dc and can attract mnz b-cells towards gc  <cit> . the higher expression of ccl <dig> may be especially important during the onset of a gc reaction, the time point to recruit antigen primed pre-gc b-cells, which then interact with gc dc to initiate and maintain the gc reaction. the gc compartment showed increased expression of cxcl <dig> . which has pleiotropic effects, including stimulation of monocytes and t cell migration  <cit> .

the gc also showed increased transcriptional level of genes that may suppress or control inflammatory responses; e.g., socs <dig> limits cellular response to ifnγ, il- <dig> and il- <dig> <cit> . macrophage inhibiting cytokine  <dig>   <cit> , is only expressed by activated macrophages, but not by resting macrophages. its higher expression in the gc may reflect the presence of moderate numbers of macrophages and its possible role in suppressing the inflammatory response in the gc.

increased expression of the chemokine ccl <dig> was observed in mnz cells. human naïve and memory b-cells express the cognate receptor for ccl <dig>  cc-chemokine receptor  <dig>   <cit> . the high expression of ccl <dig> may play a vital role in naïve b-cell migration and localization in the mnz. the chemokine gene cxcl <dig>  is highly expressed in mgz cells. the receptor for cxcl <dig> is cxcr <dig>  which is present on cd34+ cells, myeloid cells, cd4+ t cells, b-cells, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and dendritic cells. in the bone marrow, stromal cells secrete cxcl <dig>  which is involved in the emigration of hematopoietic precursors to the marrow during embryogenesis  <cit> . in peripheral lymphoid organs cxcl <dig> may be involved in the migration of b-cells and possibly other cells, such as t cells and plasma cells, to the mgz. ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig>  were more highly expressed in the mgz. ccl <dig> can activate human monocytes via receptors that also recognize ccl <dig>  <cit> . ccl <dig> is a proinflammatory cytokine important in the clearance of viral infections and the stimulation of the innate immune response  <cit> . thus, the expression of this gene may be important in innate immunity in the mgz of the spleen. cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> were upregulated in both microdissected mgz and mnz compared with the facs-sorted b-cell populations. previous studies have established an important role for cxcl <dig>  in the development of peyer's patches  and many peripheral lymph nodes. it also controls b-cell migration and thus the organization of b-cell areas  <cit> . ccl <dig> , a stromal related chemokine, elaborated by activated t, nk and macrophages has been shown to interact with cd <dig> to activate the mapk pathway  <cit> . it is possible that ccl <dig>  under appropriate conditions, contributes to cellular activation that may be particularly relevant to mgz b-cells, in which rapid response on recognition of antigen stress signal is important.

a number of ifn-induced genes  were also preferentially expressed and may reflect the unique function of the mgz to provide the first rapid response to particulate or t cell-independent antigens. the mgz also showed increased expression of many members of g protein pathways consistent with more active chemotaxis, cell motility and secretory functions. in addition, mgz cells showed higher expression of il-7rα, consistent with the role of the il-7r in mgz organization  <cit> . aside from its role in b-cell differentiation and proliferation il-7rα expression is also required for the recruitment of precursor cells to develop in secondary lymphoid organs and for the proper structural organization of these organs  <cit> .

extracellular matrix and stromal signature 
cells function within the context of a three-dimensional  extracellular matrix  that participates in regulating cellular motility, proliferation and survival. in the gc, col9a <dig>  which encodes collagen ix  <cit> , and col2a <dig>  which encodes collagen xi  <cit> , were uniquely overexpressed. in the marginal zone col14a <dig>  col16a <dig>  col3a <dig> and col6a <dig> were expressed at higher level, which suggests a role for these genes in the synthesis of specific extracellular matrix. there was also a marked overexpression of macrophage metalloelastase  <dig> , encoding a metalloproteinase that preferentially degrades elastin and takes part in the remodeling of extracellular matrix. no collagen-specific gene was up-regulated in the mnz.

microdissected compartments contained a minor component of stromal t cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and fibroblasts whereas facs-sorted cells from lymphoid tissues comprise almost exclusively b-cells. thus, an insight into the gene expression profile of the stromal elements can be obtained by comparing the expression profile of facs-sorted and microdissected cells. we found a set of genes that likely represent the stromal signature. osteonectin , upregulated in lcm samples, encodes a matrix-associated protein that elicits changes in cell shape, inhibits cell-cycle progression, and influences the synthesis of extracellular matrix  <cit> . it regulates endothelial barrier function through f-actin-dependent changes in cell shape  <cit> . two members of the maf family  were also part of the stromal signature. the maf family of genes encode bzip nuclear transcription factors and play an important role in morphogenesis and cellular differentiation  <cit> . these genes are expressed in a variety of organs, including the spleen, in agreement with our finding. the mgz expressed elevated levels of icam <dig> and vcam <dig>  mgz b cells express the integrin lfa <dig> which binds to its ligands icam <dig> and vcam <dig>  and this interaction may control the localization of these b cells  <cit>  in this compartment. our results also showed elevated expression of vcam <dig>  itgal  and itga <dig> in the mnz, suggesting a role for these adhesion molecules in mantle cell localization as well. the kruppel-like transcription factor bcl11a , which is essential for normal b-cell lymphopoiesis, was upregulated in lcm cells only. interestingly, bone marrow from bcl11a-/- mouse can induce thymic lymphoma in wild type mice. thus, the increased expression of bcl11a in the mnz and mgz may be physiologically relevant to the function of lymphocytes in these regions  <cit> .

other differentially expressed genes 
many genes know to be specifically expressed in gc b-cells are found to be upregulated: e. g., bcl <dig>  cd <dig>  gcet <dig>  gcet <dig>  jaw <dig> and cd <dig>  a number of genes were clearly upregulated in the mnz or mgz but their functional significance is largely unknown. some of these would be interesting targets for further investigation. among the genes encoding surface molecules, cd <dig> was highly expressed in the gc. cd <dig> antigen is a small protein that inhibits complement-mediated pore formation or lysis by preventing the formation of membrane-embedded c <dig> multimers  <cit> . it is likely that the over expression of cd <dig> in gc can prevent complement-mediated damage to fdcs with entrapped immune complex. cd <dig> and cd <dig> are well established markers of gc b-cell and over expression of the corresponding mrna in the gc is expected  <cit> . notably, ciita was markedly down regulated in gc cells, associated with a general low expression of mhc transcripts.

CONCLUSIONS
the gene expression profiles of the three b-cell compartments reflect distinctive functional attributes of the resident b-cell populations. they also showed different molecular microenvironments that allow the different b-cell populations to differentiate and function properly. gc b-cells have a high proliferation gene signature, whereas mnz and mgz cells are characterized by signals that help to maintain the quiescent state. genes involved in the apoptosis pathway are differentially expressed in the three b-cell compartments, reflecting different adaptations for survival in different b-cell populations. expression of different chemokines, their receptors, and stromal molecules have been detected. many of these have been implicated in the establishment of the normal lymphoid architecture in peripheral lymphoid organs and in attracting distinct immune-cell populations to specific lymphoid areas. the expression of unique sets of genes may also reflect the functional adaptation of cells in a specific location, such as genes involved in dna repair in the gc and genes that are active in innate immune response to infection in the mgz. gene expression profiling of b-cell compartments has allowed us to obtain a global survey of the molecular signals that are functionally important in b-cell subpopulations as well as the respective microenvironments. one of the major challenges is to delineate the functions of the uncharacterized genes that are unique to each of the compartments. another challenge is to exploit these normal transcriptional profiles to further our understanding of the normal immune response and the derangements resulting in the corresponding lymphoid tumors.
