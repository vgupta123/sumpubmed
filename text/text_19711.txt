BACKGROUND
chronic ethanol exposure has been shown to cause damage to the adult and developing nervous system  <cit> . for example, in vivo chronic ethanol has been shown to cause aberrant sprouting of hippocampal neurites in developing rats  <cit> , increase the length of dendrites in cerebellar purkinje neurons  <cit> , the size of synaptic terminals of cerebellar granule cells  <cit> , and the number of dendritic spines on hippocampal dentate granule neurons in adult rats  <cit> . furthermore, in vitro ethanol enhances neurite outgrowth in cultured rat cerebellar neurons  <cit> . contrary to the enhancement of neurite outgrowth, other studies have shown that chronic ethanol exposure inhibits the growth of dendrites in ca <dig> hippocampal neurons and cerebellar purkinje cells in vivo and inhibits chick spinal cord neurite formation in vitro  <cit> . however, the mechanisms underlying this alteration of dendrite formation induced by ethanol exposure remain unknown.

pc <dig> cells have been used as a cell culture model system to study the underlying mechanisms of ethanol's alteration of neurite outgrowth  <cit> . pc <dig> cells are a rat chromaffin cell line that differentiate into neuronal-like cells in the presence of nerve growth factor   <cit> . using these cells, chronic ethanol has been shown to enhance ngf-induced neurite outgrowth  <cit> . thus, pc <dig> cells have proven to be a valuable system for studying the mechanisms underlying ethanol-induced enhancement of neurite outgrowth.

nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells involves an induction of microtubule assembly  <cit> . microtubules are formed from α and β tubulin proteins, which form head to tail protofilaments  <cit> . studies have shown that protein kinase c  activation enhances the polymerization of tubulin to form microtubules  <cit> . schultz et al.  <cit>  have also demonstrated that microtubules containing phosphorylated tubulin are more stable than those containing unphosphorylated tubulin, although it remains unclear whether tubulin phosphorylation is the cause or the result of microtubule stabilization. pkc also modulates the activity of several microtubule associated proteins, including those involved in microtubule polymerization and vesicle transport  <cit> .

specific isoforms of pkc have also been implicated in mediating ngf-induced neurite outgrowth. using both antisense oligonucleotides and specific inhibitors of pkc delta, corbit et al.  <cit>  have demonstrated that this isoform of pkc is required for ngf-induced neurite outgrowth. other studies have found that in pc <dig> cells which over-express pkc epsilon, there is an enhancement of ngf-induced neurite outgrowth, while pc <dig> cells which over-express a dominant negative inhibitor of pkc epsilon show an inhibition of neurite outgrowth  <cit> . thus, both the epsilon and delta isoforms of pkc have been implicated in modulation of ngf-induced neurite outgrowth.

it is possible that the enhancement of ngf-induced neurite outgrowth produced by chronic ethanol may be due to ethanol's known alterations of pkc signaling. chronic ethanol has multiple effects on pkc, including altered pkc subcellular localization following chronic exposure  <cit> . messing et al.  <cit>  have shown that chronic ethanol exposure actually increases total cellular content of pkc delta and epsilon  in pc <dig> cells. however, other studies have shown that membrane-associated pkc activity is down-regulated following chronic ethanol exposure  <cit> . thus, while total cellular content of pkc may increase with chronic ethanol exposure, membrane-associated pkc may be down-regulated. interestingly, hundle et al.  <cit>  have shown, using pc <dig> cells which over-express an inhibitory fragment of either delta or epsilon pkc, that pkc epsilon is required for ethanol's enhancement of neurite outgrowth.

in this study, we examined the effect of chronic ethanol exposure on the neuronal microtubule cytoskeleton using pc <dig> cells as a model system. here we show that chronic ethanol exposure increases microtubule content, while decreasing free-tubulin content. thus, it appears that ethanol enhances microtubule polymerization in pc <dig> cells. we also investigated the role of microtubule polymerization in mediating ethanol's effects on neurite outgrowth using pc <dig> cells which over-express an inhibitory fragment of either delta or epsilon pkc. importantly, it is the pkc epsilon isoform which is required for ethanol's enhancement of neurite outgrowth. here, we found that the pkc delta isoform, but not the pkc epsilon isoform, is required for the enhancement of microtubule polymerization following treatment with chronic ethanol. thus, it appears that neurite outgrowth does not correlate with enhanced microtubule polymerization in pc <dig> cells.

RESULTS
chronic ethanol exposure increases microtubule content in pc <dig> cells
for the following studies, we used  <dig> mm ethanol for four days as a chronic exposure; a dose and duration used by previous researchers to demonstrate ethanol's enhancement of neurite outgrowth  <cit> . this is a concentration of ethanol which can easily be achieved by chronic alcoholics . figure  <dig> demonstrates that following a  <dig> hour exposure to  <dig> mm ethanol, there was approximately a 13% increase in polymerized microtubules compared to control cells . similarly, there was a significant decrease  in free-tubulin concentration  following  <dig> hours of ethanol exposure. there was no effect on total tubulin expression following four days of chronic ethanol exposure .

chronic ethanol exposure in pkc dominant-negative pc <dig> cells
we next used pc <dig> cells which over-express the first variable domain of pkc epsilon or delta, which acts as an isozyme specific inhibitor of pkc epsilon or delta  <cit> , respectively, to investigate the role of pkc in ethanol's enhancement of microtubule polymerization . interestingly, in the cells which express the inhibitor of pkc epsilon , we found that chronic ethanol exposure significantly increased microtubule content  and decreased tubulin content  . in the cells which express the inhibitor of pkc delta , there was no significant effect on microtubule  or tubulin  content. ethanol had no effect on total tubulin content in either the dne  or dnd cells . there was no difference between the control vector transfected pc <dig> cells and wild-type pc <dig> cells, thus these groups were combined and expressed in figure  <dig>  importantly, for both the dne and dnd experiments, these experiments were replicated in two different sub-clones of transfected pc <dig> cells. in other words, we had two strains of dominant-negative pkc epsilon cells  and two strains of dominant-negative pkc cells . results were similar between the two epsilon lines and between the two delta lines.

discussion
cells maintain a balance between free tubulin in the cytoplasm and tubulin which is polymerized into microtubules of the cytoskeleton. in this study, we find that chronic ethanol exposure increases microtubule content while decreasing free tubulin content in pc <dig> cells. ethanol appears to be enhancing polymerization of tubulin into microtubules. while there was no increase in total tubulin within the cells, there was a change in the proportion of tubulin in the polymerized  versus non-polymerized state.

we initially hypothesized that the increase in microtubule content was due to ethanol's enhancement of neurite outgrowth. presumably, neurite outgrowth is not due to simple stability of microtubules, but to an increase in dynamic microtubule growth. microtubules are particularly abundant along the axons of nerve cells and multiple labs have show that chronic ethanol exposure increases ngf-induced neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells  <cit> . therefore, since the cells that were exposed to ethanol have increased neurite outgrowth, this could be reflected as an increase in microtubles. however, it is not clear that there would necessarily be a concomitant decrease in free tubulin content or what effect of ethanol may have on microtubule stability, per se.

our data from experiments utilizing pc <dig> cells which express dominant negative inhibitors of pkc do not seem to support the idea that the increased microtubule content reflects increased neurite outgrowth. hundle et al.  <cit>  have demonstrated the specificity of these inhibitory fragments by measuring pma-induced translocation of pkc epsilon and delta to the particulate fraction of the cells using western blotting with isoform specific antibodies. they show  that pkc epsilon, but not pkc delta, translocation was specifically inhibited in the cells expressing the epsilon inhibitory fragment. further, pkc delta, but not pkc epsilon, was specifically inhibited in the cells expressing the delta inhibitory fragment. thus demonstrating that the delta and epsilon inhibitory fragments selectively inhibit pma-induced translocation of their corresponding pkc isozymes.

hundle et al  <cit>  has shown, using these same cells, that chronic ethanol exposure enhances ngf-induced neurite outgrowth in control cells and cells expressing a dominant-negative inhibitor of pkc delta  but not in cells expressing the inhibitor of the epsilon isoform of pkc . while it was not a goal of the current study to measure neurite outgrowth, daily observation of the cells was that neurite outgrowth was most dramatic in wild-type cells, slightly less so in the dnd cells, and very limited in dne cells . the work of hundle et al  <cit>  suggests that pkc epsilon but not pkc delta is involved in the effect of ethanol on neurite outgrowth. therefore, we would have predicted that ethanol would cause an increase in microtubule content in dnd cells but not in the dne cells which do not have increased neurite outgrowth. however, we found that chronic ethanol enhances polymerization of tubulin into microtubules in dominant-negative pkc epsilon cells but not dominant-negative delta cells. thus it appears that the delta isoform is involved in ethanol's enhancement of microtubule polymerization. further, our data suggest that neurite outgrowth does not correlate with enhanced microtubule polymerization in pc <dig> cells. interestingly, pkc delta has previously been shown to be involved in ngf-induced neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells  <cit> . it should be noted however, that our experimental paradigm varied slightly from that of hundle et al  <cit> . for example, we allowed our cells to differentiate for  <dig> days prior to beginning ethanol. therefore, apparent discrepancies of our findings with those of hundle et al  <cit>  could be related to these differences.

based on our data, we speculate that ethanol's enhancement of microtubule polymerization may involve phosphorylation of tubulin by pkc. however, it should be noted that we have, thus far, not directly measured phosphorylation of tubulin. studies have shown that chronic ethanol increases expression of delta and epsilon pkc in pc <dig> cells  <cit>  and pkc activation enhances tubulin polymerization into microtubules  <cit> . alternatively, chronic ethanol could be acting to alter important microtubule associated proteins. many of these proteins, including microtubule-associated proteins  are important for promoting microtubule assembly  <cit>  and it has been shown that pkc phosphorylation mediates the assembly-promoting activity of these proteins  <cit> . further studies are required to determine the mechanism of ethanol's enhancement of microtubule formation and the apparent role of delta pkc.

CONCLUSIONS
our studies demonstrate that chronic ethanol alters the relative ratio of free versus microtubule-associated tubulin content in pc <dig> cells, resulting in an increase in microtubule content and a corresponding decrease in free tubulin. this alteration was found to occur in wild type cells, as well as those expressing a dominant-negative inhibitor of epsilon pkc but not in cells expressing a dominant-negative inhibitor of delta pkc. these ethanol-induced changes could be important during activity-dependent remodeling of synapses or developmental growth of axons and dendrites which may lead to cognitive dysfunction.
