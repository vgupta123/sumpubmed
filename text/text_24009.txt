BACKGROUND
in a case–control genome-wide association study , to detect the associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms , we need to conduct a test for each individual snp data, which are summarized as a 2-by- <dig> table. although pearson’s chi-square test can be used, it is usually less powerful than the cochran-armitage trend test  if the genetic model is known . however, if the genetic models are unknown or various, the optimal scores in the catts are difficult or unable to find. if we use a catt with fixed scores for all snps, we may lose power for some situations . to circumvent this disadvantage, in the literature, many robust association tests have been proposed . those tests do not rely solely on one specific genetic model; rather they consider several possible genetic models simultaneously. in addition, many of them are based on the assumption that the underlying genetic model is one of the following three: additive, recessive, and dominant. for example, the maxmin efficiency robust test  by gastwirth  <cit> , and the maximum of the three optimal catts under recessive, additive, and dominant models  have been studied  <cit> . zheng and ng proposed a two-phase procedure called genetic model selection  method  <cit>  which selects a genetic model from the three models in its first stage. on the contrary, joo et al. proposed a test which eliminates genetic models  <cit> . due to the environmental interaction, there are unlimited genetic models besides the three ideal models . chen and ng proposed a robust association test based on the generalized genetic model   <cit> , which includes the recessive, additive, and dominant models as special cases. their approach obtains a p-value from a one-sided test for each of the two possible disease alleles. with the uncertainty of the disease allele, the overall p-value is then approximated from the two dependent tests.

in this paper, we propose a new robust association test which utilizes the ggm and obtains a one-sided p-value based on the selected disease allele. the performance of the new test is compared with existing methods in terms of controlling type i error rate and detecting power. some real data applications are also used to demonstrate the use of the new test.

methods
ggm and existing methods
the data of a diallelic snp with alleles a and a in a case control gwas are summarized in table  <dig>  where r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig> are the frequencies of genotypes aa, aa, and aa, respectively, for the r cases; and s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> are the frequencies of genotypes aa, aa, and aa, respectively, for the s controls.table  <dig>

among the three genotypes aa, aa, and aa, the relative risks of genotypes aa and aa to aa are defined as:  <dig>  

under the null hypothesis that there is no association between the genotype and phenotype, we have Λ1 = Λ2 =  <dig>  regarding the alternative hypothesis, we assume the underlying genetic model is a ggm, which is also called order-restricted relative risks model  <cit> . for the case where a is the disease allele, ggm assumes Λ1 ≥  <dig> and Λ2 ≥ Λ <dig> with at least one of the inequalities is strictly greater than. it is easy to see that the aforementioned ideal models, recessive , additive /2), and dominant , are all special cases of the generalized model. if a, rather a, is the disease allele, ggm assumes 1 ≥ Λ <dig> and Λ1 ≥ Λ <dig> with at least one of the inequalities is strict.

suppose the frequencies for aa, aa, and aa are p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> for cases and q <dig>  q <dig>  and q <dig> for controls, respectively. under the null hypothesis that there is no association between the disease and the genotype, it is easy to show p1 
= q <dig>  p2 
= q <dig>  and p3 
= q <dig>  in this paper, we assume the cases and controls follow trinomial distributions tn and tn , respectively.

the test statistics for some well-known existing methods are summarized as follows:

the catt test statistic is  <cit> :  

they are the scores assigned to the three columns.

the statistic for max <dig> is  <cit> :  

the statistic for gms is  <cit> :  

where i is the indicator function, and the hardy-weinberg disequilibrium trend test  statistic is given by  <cit> :

 and c is a constant and usually chosen as  <dig> . here ni = si + ri , and n = n1 + n2 + n <dig> 

the statistic for mert is  <cit> :  

the proposed test
let , it can be shown that under the null hypothesis of no association, the mean of the vector e =  <dig>  and variance-covariance matrix is.  

we define the following “standardized” statistics:  <dig>  

it is easy to prove the following result.

theorem  <dig>  asymptotically, under the null hypothesis the statistics in  follow a multivariate normal distribution, z ~ mvn , where the variance-covariance matrix is.  

from theorem  <dig>   z <dig>  z <dig> and z <dig> are linear dependent; it is not difficult to show that asymptotically  z3 = az1 + bz <dig>  where , and . it can also be shown that under the ggm, if a  is the disease allele, the expectations of zi  in  are all greater  than  <dig>  in addition, under the ggm, if z <dig> is close to  <dig>  the genetic model is close to the recessive model. on the other hand, the genetic model is unlikely to be the recessive model if z <dig> is far from  <dig> 

we will select the disease allele based on the sign of z <dig>  and combine the two one-sided p-values obtained based on the selected disease allele. following the idea of combining p-values from independent studies using robust test  <cit> , we define the test statistic as follows:  <dig>  

where Φ is the cumulative density function  of the standard normal distribution ) and f-  <dig> is the inverse of the cdf of the chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom.

usually it is difficult to directly calculate the p-value  for statistic c in . however, the p-value can be easily estimated using resampling method. specifically, we first simulate two independent samples, z <dig>  and z <dig>  both from n. then we calculate , where ,  are the estimates of a and b, and  are the estimates for pi  from the data. next we calculate.

. we repeat the above steps k times and get k values for g. the p-value can then be estimated as /k, where c is the observed statistic calculated from data using .

RESULTS
simulation study
in this section, we will assess the performance of the proposed test by comparing it with existing methods in terms of controlling type i error rate and detecting power through a comprehensive simulation study. in the simulation study we assume that cases and controls in table  <dig> follow trinomial distributions with probabilities p =  and q = , respectively. it can be shown that, for given qi’s, and relative risks Λ <dig>  Λ <dig>  the values of the corresponding pi’s can be obtained as follows : , , and .

we first assume hardy–weinberg equilibrium  holds for controls, and the minor allele frequencies  are  <dig>  and  <dig> . the disease allele is either the minor or the major allele. the numbers of cases  and controls  are both set to be  <dig>  different pairs of Λ <dig> and Λ <dig> are used in the simulation to compare the performance of our proposed method with those of gms, mert, max <dig>  pearson’s chi-square test, and catt with x =  <dig> , which is the commonly used test under the assumption of additive genetic model. more specifically, we fix Λ <dig> to be  <dig>  and let Λ <dig> vary from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with increment  <dig> . therefore, the three special genetic models are included in the simulation study. to assess the robustness of the proposed test, we also simulate data from genetic models other than the ggm: over-dominant model  and under-dominant model . the significance level is set to be  <dig> , and the type i error rate and power are estimated by the proportions of rejections from  <dig> replicates. to estimate the p-value for the proposed test, we resample  <dig>  times . the p-values from max <dig>  gms, and mert are obtained by using the r package “rassoc”  <cit> .

when the null hypothesis is true , all methods have rejection proportions close to the preset significance level  <dig>  ; this indicates that they can control type i error rate. table  <dig> reports the empirical powers of each method when hwe holds for controls with maf equals to  <dig> , and the minor allele is the risk allele. the chi-square test is usually less powerful than the proposed test except for the condition where the genetic model is over-dominant, under which the proposed test is more powerful than other methods. the catt and mert perform relatively poorly when the genetic models are far from the additive model. max <dig> and gms perform similarly and have comparable power values with the proposed test; while the new test performs better when the genetic model is dominant or over-dominant. table  <dig> lists the power values when hwe holds for controls with maf equals to  <dig> , and the major allele is the risk allele. once again, the catt and mert lose power dramatically compared to other methods when the genetic model is recessive or under-dominant. the proposed test is more powerful than the max <dig> and gms when the genetic models are close to recessive model. the chi-square test is less powerful than the proposed test when the genetic models are between recessive and dominant.table  <dig>

the method based on ggm by chen and ng  has similar performance as the proposed test. however, if the disease allele is the minor allele, the new test is more powerful than the ggm method when the genetic model is dominant or over-dominant . in addition, unlike the proposed test, the ggm method doesn’t report the disease allele.

real data application
to illustrate the use of the proposed test, we apply it to some real data. the snp rs <dig> has been shown to be associated with parkinson disease  <cit> . table  <dig> lists the genotypic counts of cases and controls of this snp from fifteen sites  <cit> . we apply the proposed test and others to the data of each site to obtain p-values. table  <dig> reports the results along with the three statistics, z <dig>  z <dig> and z <dig>  out of the  <dig> populations,  <dig> have positive values for z <dig>  indicating the disease allele is a rather than g for this snp. recall the statistic z <dig> compares genotype gg to ga between controls and cases. a small z <dig> indicates the relative risk Λ <dig> is close to  <dig>  and therefore the genetic model is close to the recessive one. on the other hand, if z <dig> is large, the underlying genetic model is unlikely to be a recessive model. for population d, the estimated z <dig> is - <dig> , the genetic model is close to a recessive one, under which the catt test is less powerful than other robust methods. in fact, for this population catt obtains the largest p-value . similar observation can be found for population g. in contrast, z <dig> and z <dig> from populations h and o are both large, indicating the underlying genetic models are close to the additive model, under which the catt is more powerful than others. therefore, there is no surprise that catt obtains the smallest p-values from those two populations.table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
although catt has been widely used in case–control gwas with the assumption that the underlying genetic model is additive, its performance may be very poor if the true genetic model is not additive. therefore, robust but powerful association tests are more appropriate when detecting the associated snps. many existing association tests make the assumption that the genetic model is one of the three special genetic models , which may be a too strong assumption in practice. in this paper, we propose a robust association test without making strong assumption about the genetic model. our simulation results show that even the assumption of ggm is violated , the proposed test still has reasonable power; indicating it is a robust test. in terms of computational cost, the proposed test is reasonably fast. for instance, it took my desktop about 70 seconds to get the results in table  <dig> for the real data application. our simulation study also confirmed that the proposed test can control type i error rate with smaller cutoff p-value, e.g., 10- <dig> and 10- <dig> .

the test statistic in  is defined based on the idea of combining p-values from independent studies using chi-square distribution with  <dig> degree of freedom  <cit> . although there are many other approaches available in the literature , it remains a research topic to choose the best one if there is any. however, it should be noticed that for case control gwas, a robust method, such as the proposed test, is desirable due to the various underlying genetic models. in addition, when we combine the p-values from the  <dig> independent studies using the chi-square distribution with  <dig> degree of freedom  <cit> , the overall p-value is  <dig>  × 10- <dig> 

through simulation studies and real data applications, we have shown that the proposed test is robust and powerful. in addition, the three statistics, z <dig>  z <dig>  and z <dig>  may also provide useful information about the disease allele and the genetic model.
