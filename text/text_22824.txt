BACKGROUND
it is essential to understand the host immune response in order to boost or modulate the immune system in infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, allergies or cancer. this requires knowledge of the peptides selected and presented by class ii major histocompatibility complex  molecules and the rules governing their binding and presentation to cd4+ t cells. molecules of the mhc are surface receptors on immune cells that bind and present selected antigen as short peptides or epitopes to t cells with matching receptors. the peptides are produced by the proteolytic machinery of the antigen presenting cell. class i epitopes are generated from intracellular proteins  <cit>  and class ii epitopes are processed from vesicular, endocytosed and cytosolic proteins through the exogenous pathway  <cit> . processed peptides are loaded in intracellular compartments and transported to the cell surface where they are displayed for recognition by t cells. the unique design of the peptide binding region of the mhc and the vast polymorphism, through duplication, gene conversion and other genetic mechanisms, combine to generate hundreds of molecular variants at class i hla-a, -b, -c and class ii hla-d loci  <cit> . through these mechanisms mhc molecules are able to recognize and bind a vast array of peptides with fine distinction. each allele has a different peptide binding specificity.

the mhc receptor comprises a membrane distal peptide binding domain sitting on a scaffold or platform formed by two immunoglobulin domains juxtaposed in a characteristic fashion. the peptide binding domain consists of eight anti-parallel beta strands on top of which lie two anti-parallel alpha helices. this is a unique fold and the two alpha helices form the walls of the peptide binding cleft  <cit> . polymorphic residues in the beta sheet floor and in the alpha helical walls of the mhc form pockets that enforce genetic restriction and allele specificity  <cit> . peptides that bind to class i molecules have a restricted length, about eight to eleven residues. the bound peptide forms hydrogen bonds with conserved residues at either end of the cleft effectively sealing them. class ii molecules, on the other hand, are open at either end and allow peptides of nearly unrestricted length to extend over the termini of the binding groove.

the register of the peptide cleft or binding groove in both class i and class ii mhc molecules is nine residues  <cit> . the positions are labelled p <dig>  p <dig>  ..., p <dig>  relative to the large n-terminal pocket in class ii. pockets p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> are prominent pockets in class ii molecules; p <dig> and p <dig> are shallow shelves or minor pockets. bound peptides in class ii molecules adopt a polyproline type ii-like conformation  <cit> . this near helical conformation allows the bound peptide to engage the major polymorphic pockets with anchor residues lodged in p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> leaving peptide side chains at p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> simultaneously available for inspection by t cells. peptide binding energy derives from the engagement of the peptide anchor residues in the mhc binding pockets with additional contribution from hydrogen bonds from the peptide backbone to conserved residues within the class ii mhc molecule.

methods to identify peptides that are immunogenic are important in basic and applied research – for fundamental understanding and for designing new drugs and vaccines to treat disease. traditionally, this has meant synthesizing overlapping peptides covering the entire sequence followed by purification and direct or indirect assays of peptide binding to mhc molecules. this is time consuming and expensive. reliable computational screening followed by experimental validation provides a more rapid and less expensive alternative. this may be carried out for several alleles to cover a wide segment of the population.

the restricting mhc molecule imposes structural constraints on the peptide anchors through polymorphic residues within the pockets  <cit> . this defines the peptide binding motif  <cit>  for an allele. related alleles have overlapping peptide repertoire and share a similar motif or core sequence  <cit> . anchor motifs such as obtained through eluted natural ligands and phage display libraries have been useful in epitope prediction  <cit> . quantitative matrices are extended motifs. they are an improvement over simple motifs and provide more informational content. their coefficients describe the likelihood of an amino acid at a given location in a peptide to contribute to binding to an mhc allele  <cit> . they give high specificity, are fast, intuitive and easy to use.

quantitative matrices are typically  <dig> ×  <dig> in dimension reflecting the twenty natural amino acids and the nine residue register of the binding cleft of mhc molecules  <cit>  as has been determined by x-ray crystallography  <cit> . the overall binding energy of the peptide is assumed to be the linear sum of the contribution of individual side chains. the peptide backbone hydrogen bonding contribution is ignored. this scheme is the independent binding of side chains approximation  <cit> . equivalent matrices have been derived from the relative abundance of an amino acid at a given position from the sequence alignment profile of a library of known binders to an mhc allele  <cit> . epitope prediction by quantitative matrices has been useful in identifying antigens in allergens  <cit> , infectious agents such as mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> , and tumours  <cit> . reviews by korber and colleagues and by tsurui and takahashi give a current survey of the field  <cit> .

most prediction programs, whether they use quantitative matrices or machine learning methods, employ the canonical nine pocket binding register. there is growing appreciation that flanking residues influence peptide binding  <cit> . flanking residues at the c-terminus of the binding groove of class ii mhc molecules are polymorphic. the shelf formed at flanking position p <dig> makes potential sequence dependent contribution toward peptide binding energy. the equivalent flanking position at the n-terminus of the peptide groove is conserved; therefore the contribution of the position preceding pocket p <dig>  is ignored.

results from structural and binding studies using the peptide awcsdealplgsprcd in complex with hla-drb3* <dig>  show a contribution from position p <dig>  24-awcsdealplgsprcd- <dig>  from the n-terminus of human integrin α2βiiia is a major ligand of dr52a. a natural variant of the epitope widely distributed in the population is 24-awcsdealppgsprcd- <dig>  the leu33/pro <dig> dimorphism is the basis of the unidirectional alloimmune posttransfusion thrombocytopenia purpura  and fetal-maternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia , severe blood disorders in some dr52a subjects homozygous in pro <dig>  <cit> . while awcsdealppgs, or the second epitope 24-awcsdealppgsprcd- <dig> , does not bind to dr52a awcsdealppls  has been demonstrated to bind. this has been confirmed by crystallographic studies . these point to the contribution of leucine as an auxiliary anchor and the importance of position p <dig>  other studies of peptide-class ii mhc complexes show a sequence dependent role for p <dig>  <cit> .

in this study, we examine whether adding the contribution of position p <dig> improves prediction accuracy over a common 9-pocket matrix  <cit> . we construct two new quantitative scoring matrices for hla-dr <dig> extended to include the contribution of flanking position p <dig>  coefficients for position  <dig> were constructed from the peptide library aaysdqatpllxspr, where x at position p <dig> is one of the twenty natural amino acids. canonical anchor residues are in bold. the base peptide was derived from the n-terminal human integrin α2βiiia peptide used for dr52a studies and has been designed to bind in a specific frame to hla-dr <dig> by substituting well known anchor residues from the dr <dig> peptide binding motif and crystallographic studies  <cit> . a second peptide library was based on aaysdqatlllxspr where a proline has been replaced with leucine in order to avoid conformational effects due to proline. we find that the new matrix based on aaysdqatpllxspr  shows significant improvement over the original nine residue register matrix, p <dig>  the matrix based on aaysdqatlllxspr  does not show such improvement. the peptide libraries for the extended matrices differ in sequence at one position: proline versus leucine.

RESULTS
bioinformatic analysis
we have used ic <dig> values, obtained from binding assays of a variety of test peptides to dr <dig>  to construct coefficients to extend the hammer 9-register matrix  <cit>   to position  <dig> of the peptide binding cleft. the protocol is described under methods. the new extended matrices, p <dig> and pp <dig>  are validated in regression analysis of predicted values against experimental binding measurements of peptides from glutamic acid decarboxylase , islet cell antigens   <cit>  and varicella-zoster virus  . we compare these with results using the canonical 9-register matrix for dr <dig>  <cit> . the tepitope virtual matrices for dr <dig> and other alleles  <cit>  are based on this published matrix according to similarity in the pocket sequence profile. logarithm of ic <dig> values are plotted against predicted values and a function is fit to the data. a fitting function is chosen whose coefficients minimize the residuals.

the best fit was found to be a straight line. higher order polynomial functions were tried but gave worse results. low ic <dig> values correspond to good binding and high ic <dig> values correspond to poor binding, and negative predicted values. a flat fit has no predictive use. plots for gad <dig>  ica <dig> and vzv are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  in all three scoring methods, there are both false positives  and false negatives . false positives can be screened out in validation tests but false negatives are problematic. with these data sets, the scoring matrices show few false negatives. this is a useful property and the matrices can be used to screen large sequences without missing potential epitopes. a high threshold may be set to eliminate falsely predicted peptides.

in all three data sets, gad <dig>  ica <dig> and vzv, for the three matrices tested there is correlation between binding  and predicted values . this indicates predictive value in all three matrices, the two new extended basis matrices p <dig> and pp <dig> and the control matrix p <dig>  for gad <dig> , matrices of the original nine-residue matrix  and the extended matrices  perform about equally from the fits. using the slope m as a surrogate measure, pp <dig> is better than p <dig>  and p <dig> is in turn better than matrix p <dig> . the analysis is summarized in table  <dig>  for ica <dig> , pp <dig> and p <dig> have nearly the same slope  and better predictive power than p <dig> . the difference between the respective slopes of p <dig> and pp <dig> is not significant but the deviation between  <dig>  and  <dig>   and  <dig>  for p <dig> appears significant. using the coarse criterion of slope m for vzv , p <dig> is better than p <dig> . visual inspection of the graphs supports these assertions . interestingly, from table  <dig>  the difference in the absolute slope values between p <dig> and p <dig> for gad <dig> and ica <dig> data sets is  <dig> . difference in peptide-hla-dr binding assay sensitivity between different antigenic proteins, data sets, individual experiments and the nature of competition assays makes it difficult to establish absolute numbers, and comparison between different data sets is difficult. comparison within a data set is more valid as revealed by the plots.

the fit of prediction to binding has been calculated for each prediction method using measures of slope , sum of the square terms of the residual error  and r-square value  for peptide sequences from gad <dig>  ica <dig> and vzv. table 1a shows the statistics for the unedited data, and table 1b shows the equivalent statistics for the data edited to remove poor binding measurements.

figures 1a, b and 1c show that low binding peptides  are poorly predicted. this marks the limit of sensitivity of the experimental measurement. the analysis is repeated without these points: figures 2a, b and 2c show the same plots when data points representing poor ic <dig> values are ignored. it is not clear how significant the difference between p <dig> and p <dig> slopes is for gad <dig>  nevertheless, the conclusion that pp <dig> is superior is not changed. the vzv data set further reveals the difference in performance between p <dig> and p <dig>  the magnitude of the slope used this way calibrates closely the "structure" or "informational potential" within the data; a flat fit signifies random data and has neither "structure" nor predictive potential.

the predictive potential is more accurately captured in terms of variance  and residuals . residuals for the three data sets were calculated. a typical plot is shown in figure  <dig> for gad <dig> data set. the sum of the square of the residual values is calculated for each prediction matrix p <dig>  p <dig> or pp <dig>  finally, the quality of the fit is assessed through the r-square value:

  r2= 

j is the sum of the square terms of the residual error and s is the variance of the data. the analyses incorporating the slope m of the fitting function, residuals j, and r <dig> are shown in table  <dig>  r <dig> values range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the full data and  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the pruned set. the corresponding range for the magnitude of the slope is  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the full set and  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the edited set. the slopes shadow closely the respective r <dig> values .

from r <dig> values, prediction method pp <dig> again works the best in both gad <dig> and ica <dig> data sets: pp <dig> performs better than the control matrix p <dig> and is superior to the other extended basis matrix p <dig>  p <dig> is better than the control p <dig> matrix in gad <dig>  but not in ica <dig> . the ordering and conclusions are unchanged with filtered data. pp <dig> matrix has superior discrimination potential in terms of the slope m and also in terms of r <dig>  pp <dig> shows marked improvement over matrix p <dig> and pp <dig> is also better than p <dig>  while extended matrix p <dig> makes better prediction than p <dig> in gad <dig> it is worse than p <dig> in the edited ica <dig> data set. in vzv, matrix p <dig> shows no improvement over p <dig> in either the filtered or unfiltered data sets, according to r <dig>  overall, average r <dig> values of the raw data sets  are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively for p <dig>  p <dig> and pp <dig>  for comparison, reported average r <dig> value of a large-scale evaluation of class ii molecules using similar quantitative matrices is  <dig>  <cit> .

structural analysis
to gain structural insight into epitope prediction, and why matrix pp <dig> performs better than p <dig>  we examined peptides that bind well according to ic <dig> binding measurements. the best experimental binding measurement is for peptide  <dig> from gad <dig> . the same register frmvisnpa is predicted as a strong binder for both matrices, p <dig>  and pp <dig> . anchor residues at dominant pockets p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> are as expected for dr <dig>  <cit> . ala at position p <dig> is also predicted to contribute to favourable binding. incidentally, matrix p <dig> is in agreement: the same binding frame is predicted and ala at the extended position is also predicted to interact with the shallow shelf at position p <dig> for enhanced binding. the added contribution of ala is given greater weight in matrix p <dig>  than in pp <dig> . competition binding assay of the peptides used for the libraries shows that ala is a preferred residue at p <dig> for hla-dr <dig> 

a unanimous binding frame  is also predicted from peptide  <dig>  scskvdvnyaflhatdllpa, another strong binder. leucine at position p <dig> is predicted to contribute to greater binding affinity, in agreement with experiment. matrices p <dig> and pp <dig> predict the same frame  in peptide  <dig>  qvaqkftggignklcallyg . strong peptide anchor residues at p <dig> and p <dig>  compensate for poor anchors  at p <dig> and p <dig>  and the contribution of cysteine at position p <dig> is predicted to enhance binding from matrix pp <dig>  the predicted binding frame in matrix p <dig>  however, differs – ignklcally.

another example shows how the extended position changes the predicted binding frame between matrices p <dig> and pp10: in shfslkkgaaalgigtdsvi , lkkgaaalg is predicted to bind best by matrix p <dig> while fslkkgaaal is predicted by the two extended basis matrices. lkkgaaalg  has a good leucine anchor at p <dig> but three poor anchors at p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  for matrices p <dig> and pp <dig>  a strong phenylalanine anchor at position p <dig> in the peptide predicted combines with lysine at p <dig> and the auxiliary leucine anchor at position  <dig> to improve the score.

the peptide vetfrhraisdtwltvnrme from ica <dig> is another example where the extended matrix pp <dig> predicts a frame  different from that predicted by p <dig> . the better score predicted by pp <dig> may arise from an aromatic hydrophobic anchor in pocket  <dig> versus a relatively small aliphatic p <dig> anchor, valine, predicted by matrix p <dig>  in the latter, phenylalanine is disfavoured in pocket  <dig>  and likewise histidine in pocket  <dig>  in the frame predicted by matrix p <dig>  the other extended matrix p <dig> predicts the same frame as pp <dig> but with a much worse score . this implies a predicted negative contribution of tryptophan at position p <dig> for matrix p <dig> but a positive contribution of tryptophan for pp <dig>  experimental binding measurements support a positive contribution of tryptophan at pocket  <dig>  the binding frame predicted by matrix pp <dig> is structurally consistent with the measured binding affinity.

in peptide  <dig>  the ica <dig> peptide qcrteyrgallwmkdvsqel  is predicted to bind in a different frame  than that predicted for pp <dig> . non-ideal anchors  predicted by matrix p <dig> are compensated by good anchors . the frame predicted by pp <dig> possesses a large and favourable hydrophobic anchor  at p <dig>  a favoured small residue  at p <dig> but leu and lys at pockets p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively. leu and lys are disfavoured in these positions. the contribution at position p <dig> does not overcome these hindrances.

aihesfkgyqpyefttlksl and rkesssfktedgksilsald  are predicted as strong binders, in agreement with experimental data, and in the expected registers, fkgyqpyef and fktedgksi, for all three matrices. in peptide  <dig>  polar threonine is not favoured at position p10; this reduces the score slightly in both extended matrices. on the other hand, in peptide  <dig>  hydrophobic leucine anchor at p <dig> in the predicted fragment enhances the interaction between dr <dig> and the peptide ligand to give a slightly higher score for both extended matrices p <dig> and pp <dig> 

and in another example, the predicted register is shifted one position between matrices p <dig> and pp <dig> for peptide svvnkmqqrywetkqafika : vnkmqqryw and vvnkmqqryw . the added basis in pp <dig>  the increased number of parameters, has allowed better prediction accuracy.

finally, all three matrices unanimously select the same best frame ygafdplla from overlapping peptides  <dig> and  <dig> . the experimental pic <dig> values are  <dig>   and - <dig>   compared to predicted scores of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for p <dig>  p <dig> and pp <dig>  respectively. similarly, the same frame frkvqtqvrl is unanimously selected by the three matrices for peptides  <dig> and  <dig> . pic <dig> values are  <dig>   and  <dig>  . predicted scores are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for p <dig>  p <dig> and pp <dig>  respectively, for the unanimously predicted best frame for the two peptides. in the former pair of peptides, the experimental values are far apart while the computational scores are relatively close. in the latter set, the experimental values are close but the predicted scores show a big spread.

statistics for predicted scores are easy to obtain but similar statistics for binding measurements are difficult to obtain as little statistical data is given along with the experimental data. as is typical of such measurements, baseline values are determined on a case by case basis.

discussion
an important contribution to the binding affinity of peptide to class ii mhc is the aggregate of the interaction of individual peptide side chains with the polymorphic pockets. the contribution of backbone atoms is ignored as is formalized in the independent binding of pockets hypothesis  <cit>  that underlies epitope prediction algorithms based on quantitative matrices. methods of epitope prediction, including quantitative matrices, typically consider only the nine positions or pockets within the binding groove. there are reports that show, however, that sequences flanking the binding cleft affect peptide binding affinity  <cit> . this contribution when accounted for may therefore improve epitope prediction accuracy for class ii mhc alleles. the termini of the binding groove of class i molecules are sealed.

we constructed two matrices p <dig> and pp <dig> that incorporate flanking position p <dig> and tested them against experimental binding data. extended matrix pp <dig> showed significant improvement over the canonical 9-mer matrix, p <dig>  in validation tests of two typical data sets extended matrix pp <dig> showed superior performance  over the original p <dig> matrix . on the same test sets, extended matrix p <dig> performed no better  than p <dig> .

the superior performance of prediction matrix pp <dig> is best explained in terms of additional position p <dig> in the binding register. this explicitly increases the number of parameters. a major conclusion therefore is that incorporating the flanking position may improve class ii mhc epitope prediction. extended matrix pp <dig> also selects a more plausible binding register than what is predicted by matrix p <dig>  the relative poor performance of matrix p <dig> is best explained in terms of the difference in sequence of the peptide library it was based on. it is not clear the effect of the -lll- subsequence  on the peptide conformation. conversely, it is conceivable that the better performance of matrix pp <dig> derives from greater stabilization of the peptide polyproline ii-like conformation by the extra proline in the sequence of the peptide library.

the left handed polyproline ii helical conformation is found in structural proteins, in signalling molecules and as ligands in mhc complexes  <cit> . proline is unusual among natural amino acids. in a polypeptide, its φ torsion angle is restricted to -63°. the δ carbon of the proline ring interacts with the backbone n and constrains the preceding residue  <cit> . such influence of proline on the adjacent residue is contrary to the assumption of independent binding of peptide side chains and needs accounting in quantitative scoring matrices.

many lines of structural studies of peptide-mhc complexes suggest cooperative interactions between pockets  <cit> . peptide selection and binding may be compared to sampling the conformational space available to the complex of peptide and mhc. the path followed and the final structure adopted by the complex depend on sequence, and these involve cooperative interactions. the accompanying conformational changes are not accounted for in quantitative matrices. a related issue is the stability of the bound complex.

hydrogen bonds from the peptide backbone are a major contribution to peptide-class ii mhc binding. experimental structures show 12– <dig> such bonds from the peptide backbone to usually conserved residues in the class ii molecule. each such hydrogen bond is important for binding affinity and stability  <cit> . while, in principle, these backbone hydrogen bonds enable peptide binding regardless of sequence the number of such bonds may vary depending on the peptide sequence. proline residues in a peptide sequence can alter the pattern and number of such backbone hydrogen bonds. neither quantitative matrices nor the assumption of independent binding takes backbone hydrogen bonding into account.

further, a given peptide-class ii complex is best represented as a heterogeneous set of conformations of varying stability. these conformational dynamics are a function of the particular peptide in the mhc and reflect sequence, near neighbour and long range pocket interactions. this is another limiting factor in epitope prediction. already, sequence dependence is assumed in functional work and sequence sensitivity to selectivity and stability of class ii ligands has been demonstrated in the catalysis of peptide loading down to the level of hydrogen bonds  <cit> .

peters and colleagues have proposed the method of stabilized matrices  <cit>  to account for near neighbour and cooperative interactions between pockets. their calculated coefficients are used to augment the well known quantitative matrices used in tepitope  <cit> . the added terms are small, about a factor of  <dig> smaller than the entries of the original quantitative matrices. however, stabilized matrices improved prediction performance over the original quantitative matrix, and to a level equalling or exceeding that of general  methods.

this report does not address questions about peptides that are poorly predicted. experimental limitations are a factor in poor predictions but are difficult to quantify. measured ic <dig> values are relative to a reference peptide, and sensitivity may vary from assay to assay. it is also not always clear what is binding. if bound peptide is what is being measured, other questions arise such as in what frame. an examination of crystallographic structures of peptide-class ii mhc complexes shows that peptide anchors are not always fully engaged in binding pockets especially after pocket p6; in the collagen peptide complex with drb5* <dig>  <cit>  the peptide side chain at p <dig> is out of pocket and extends rather to the shelf at position  <dig>  in general, not all pockets need to be fully engaged for good peptide binding  <cit> . short of experimentally derived structures exactly how peptides bind in each complex, or whether they bind at all in the binding site, as measured in assays, has to be assumed. these issues are intimately linked with the biology of the system.

the biology and the experimental restriction of the system are important limiting factors in t cell epitope prediction accuracy. immunoassays need to become reliably quantitative in order to ensure accuracy in prediction. heterogeneity of peptide conformations also needs to be addressed. these are difficult issues but they must be taken into account in interpreting results from epitope prediction.

CONCLUSIONS
this study set out to find whether the contribution of flanking pocket  <dig> improves prediction accuracy. two matrices incorporating position p <dig> were constructed. tests showed that the contribution of the added basis describing position p <dig> may lead to improved prediction over the usual nine residue register matrix. the added dimension explicitly increases the parameters. the study also revealed the importance of sequence context.

the aim of modern biology is to explain physiological phenomena not only at the level of cells and tissues but also at the molecular level. this requires full knowledge of the coding sequence and the atomic structure of the molecules. nevertheless, the three dimensional representation of molecules of itself is inadequate. near neighbour interactions between residues, long range cooperative effects between domains and other tempo-spatial effects are just as important, hence a need for representations that capture these.

quantitative matrices used in epitope prediction are actually an example of such parameterization. a matrix coefficient contains parameterization of the physical chemical properties of pocket shape, peptide side chain to pocket interactions and electrostatics without explicit description. sequence dependence is considered on the basis of individual pockets. the approach followed here similarly aims at increasing the parameters of the scoring matrix by explicitly increasing the basis through flanking position p <dig>  the method of stabilized matrices has demonstrated a way of introducing small additional terms describing cooperative effects  <cit> .

comparing the performance of the two extended matrices described here has made evident implicit sequence bias in the matrices. proper accounting of sequence effect will further contribute to prediction accuracy. peptide libraries are implicitly optimized through the incorporation of favourable residues at anchor positions; these capture salient nonlinear features of peptide conformations. fuller understanding may lead to a judicious choice of basis, parameters or peptide library to construct scoring matrices that capture more of these cooperative interactions to improve prediction accuracy.
