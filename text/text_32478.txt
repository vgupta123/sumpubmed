BACKGROUND
the subgenus schizotrypanum harbors the type species trypanosoma cruzi, which is the causative agent of chagas disease in humans. other members of the schizotrypanum subgenus are often referred to as t. cruzi-like species as they are morphologically similar or indistinguishable from t. cruzi <cit> . with the exception of the human infecting parasite, members of schizotrypanum are restricted to bats  and occur in high prevalence among bats in latin america and elsewhere in the world
 <cit> . there is no evidence that t. cruzi-like parasites are harmful to bats, although this may reflect a paucity of data. most infected bats are insectivorous and infection is thought to take place either through ingestion of infected arthropods or via stercorarian transmission from bat-feeding bugs
 <cit> . the genetic diversity of t. cruzi-like species and their evolutionary relationships are yet to be determined.

trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei is a bat-associated subspecies of t. cruzi <cit> . the human infective parasite t. cruzi should accordingly be referred to as the nominate subspecies t. cruzi cruzi 
 <cit> . t. c. marinkellei is prevalent among bats in central and south america, which are its only known mammalian hosts
 <cit> . it differs from t. c. cruzi in terms of isoenzyme electrophoresis patterns and buoyant dna densities. t. c. marinkellei does not infect immunocompetent mice
 <cit> , nor does it provide immunological protection against challenge with t. c. cruzi <cit> , suggesting that the infection is characterized by distinct antigenic profiles. sequence-based phylogenies have confirmed a relatively close relationship with t. c. cruzi <cit>  and estimated the divergence time at ~ <dig> - <dig>  mya
 <cit> . cavazzana et al. reported that t. c. marinkellei was associated with phyllostomid species 
 <cit>  and transmission is thought to occur when triatomine bugs of the genus cavernicola feed on bats
 <cit> . however, the natural transmission cycle among bats is not well characterized and there might be other vectors or direct transmission mechanisms. some genetic substructure within the t. c. marinkellei population has been reported
 <cit> , but the strength of correlation between parasite lineage and host remains to be defined. moreover, bat-restricted parasites are of evolutionary interest, since it has been proposed that t. c. cruzi may have originated from an ancestral bat-lineage that jumped into terrestrial mammals
 <cit> . the present day human lineage, t. c. cruzi, has been in contact with humans for no more than  <dig>  to  <dig>  years, which is the period of human presence in the americas
 <cit> .

t. c. cruzi strains are currently sorted into six lineages or discrete typing units , which illustrate the genetic diversity of this parasite
 <cit> . several strains have to date been subjected to genome sequencing, among these are cl brener and sylvio x <dig>  the cl brener strain was selected for the original genome project and belongs to dtu vi. the size of the cl brener genome was ~ <dig> mb and it was assembled mostly with sanger paired-end reads. the cl brener strain was shown to be a genetic hybrid of two diverged haplotypes named esmeraldo-like and non-esmeraldo-like
 <cit> . the hybrid and repetitive nature of this genome complicated sequence assembly and finishing, leaving the genome in many gaped scaffolds and contigs. weatherly et al. later compiled scaffolds into more complete chromosome-wide sequences
 <cit> . second-generation sequencing facilitates more cost-effective and rapid sequencing efforts. recently, 454-sequencing was applied on the genome of the dtu i strain sylvio x10
 <cit> , revealing a slightly smaller but still repeat-rich genome.

little is known about genomic variation among organisms within the schizotrypanum genus. genomic insights can provide information on evolutionary adaptation of these parasites, as well as being useful for advancing population genetics. thus, exploring genomic diversity could reveal important genetic and biological characteristics, and potentially clues as to how these parasites relate to the human disease. here we describe the genome of t. c. marinkellei b <dig>  a bat-associated parasite originally isolated from a colony of the pale spear-nosed bat phyllostomus discolor roosting in a hollow tree
 <cit> . the parasite was isolated in são felipe, bahia state, brazil in  <dig> and has since then been stored under cryogenic conditions with occasional short periods of in vitro cultivation. we combined roche/ <dig> and illumina sequencing to generate a draft genome sequence of t. c. marinkellei. this is the first whole genome analysis of a t. c. cruzi-like species that is not associated with human infections. in addition, we also report re-assembly and re-annotation of the human infective strain t. c. cruzi sylvio x10
 <cit> , a commonly used reference strain of t. c. cruzi i
 <cit> , using additional sequence data.

the comparative analyses with t. c. cruzi revealed that the genomes contain the same repertoire of housekeeping genes. moreover, t. c. marinkellei contains an additional gene that appears to be an example of recent horizontal gene transfer. in addition, the genomes also exhibit copy number variation and diversification of gene families, which potentially give rise to a large number of strain-specific protein isoforms.

RESULTS
sequencing and assembly of t. c. marinkellei and t. c. cruzi sylvio x10
in the text, we refer to trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei as tcm, trypanosoma cruzi cruzi sylvio x <dig> as tcc x <dig> and trypanosoma cruzi cruzi cl brener as tcc clbr. genomic sequence reads were generated from tcm and tcc x <dig> using  <dig> and illumina sequencing .  <dig> sequencing  was performed on genomic dna from tcm, which produced sequence reads with an average length of ~ <dig> nt. the  <dig> data from tcc x <dig> was the same as previously described
 <cit> . in addition, one ~ <dig> kb insert library  was prepared for tcm and tcc x <dig> respectively, using a modified version of the illumina mate-pair protocol . the modified illumina protocol was chosen to enable  <dig> nt read lengths, as illumina does not recommend its own protocol for mate-pair sequencing with read lengths > <dig> nt. this generated  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> read-pairs from tcm and tcc x <dig> respectively. not all read-pairs translated to the expected insert size of ~ <dig> kb. long insert libraries often contain a significant proportion of short insert fragments . most often this is due to non-optimal biotin enrichment causing some fragments not to circularize and therefore become sequenced with much shorter insert. we determined the number of true mate-pairs from the obtained data using an r-script previously published by van nieuwerburgh et al.
 <cit> . the script determines the location of the loxp linker sequence in the read, and then uses this information to classify read-pairs as true mate-pairs, paired-end, single-end or linker-negative. true mate-pairs should contain the loxp sequence close to the 3′ end in at least one read, indicating that circularization has taken place. in our data, 32%  and 34%  of the read-pairs were classified as true mate-pairs from tcm and tcc x <dig> respectively . 38%  and 35%  read-pairs were classified as paired-end from tcm and tcc x <dig> respectively. the remaining read-pairs were either unpaired or loxp-negative, meaning that the linker was present in the unsequenced part of the fragment or that the fragment did not contain a linker. hence, despite an improved protocol, a substantial number of paired-end and single-end reads were obtained. the causes of this has previously been discussed

the  <dig> and illumina data were subsequently assembled . in order to take platform dependent sequencing artifacts into consideration,  <dig> and illumina reads were assembled separately using different assembly programs . insertion-deletion errors in the  <dig> assemblies were identified and corrected using alignments with illumina reads, which corrected  <dig>  and  <dig>  positions of tcm and tcc x <dig> respectively. the most common error was one or two missing bases . the resulting assemblies were subsequently merged into a non-redundant assembly. distance information from mate-pair reads was used to arrange contigs into scaffolds. where possible, the distance between two adjacent contigs in a scaffold was inferred by comparison with tcc clbr, i.e. if two contigs flanking each side of a gap could be aligned with one of the cl brener haplotypes, then the approximate gap length could be inferred from cl brener. as a final assembly step, both tcm and tcc x <dig> were subjected to gap closure using the image pipeline
 <cit>  and the sorted paired-end reads . prior to feeding scaffolds into image, paired-end reads were quality filtered. image uses iterative mapping of reads to contig ends, followed by local assembly and alignment to close gaps and extend contigs. eight image iterations were completed for each genome, which improved each assembly by adding  <dig>   and  <dig>   base pairs, which closed  <dig> and  <dig> gaps and extended  <dig>  and  <dig>  contig ends from tcm and tcc x <dig> respectively.

f contigs > <dig> bp.

the combined assembly lengths were  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb for tcm and tcc x <dig> respectively. the assembly size of tcc x <dig> was very similar to our previous estimate from extrapolation of unassembled data
 <cit>  and flow cytometry
 <cit> . flow cytometry analysis estimated the haploid size of tcm to ~ <dig> mb , which was close to the in silico assembly length. thus, assembly sizes were consistent with experimental measurements. moreover, this confirmed that the tcm genome was ~ <dig>  mb smaller than that of tcc x <dig>  the percentage of assembled bases in each assembly was very similar: tcm  <dig> % ; tcc x <dig>  <dig> % . we analyzed  <dig>  unused  <dig> reads of tcm with repeatmasker, which identified  <dig>  reads corresponding to kinetoplastid sequences. the remaining reads were analyzed with blast, showing them to correspond multicopy genes or other repeats.

 <dig>  and  <dig>  scaffolds were longer than  <dig> kb, which corresponded to  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb . the longest scaffolds were  <dig> kb  and  <dig> kb . some  <dig> gaps could be closed from the apparent overlap of adjacent contigs. compared with  <dig> reads alone, addition of mated reads provided longer contigs and scaffolds, corrected  <dig> sequence errors and allowed accurate estimation of genome heterozygosity and copy number variation.

comparison of heterozygosity and multicopy genes
the level of heterozygosity among populations of medically important trypanosomes is likely to reflect the impact of key evolutionary processes such as gene conversion and genetic exchange. in the present study we estimated the amount of heterozygosity in tcm and tcc x <dig> by aligning illumina and  <dig> reads back to the assemblies and subsequently identifying high quality mismatches between the consensus sequence and aligned reads. in order to increase the confidence, only nucleotide positions with  <dig> to 80x coverage were included and contigs shorter than  <dig> kb were ignored. this resulted in  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> positions of tcm and tcc x <dig> that permitted analysis, which represented  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of each genome respectively. furthermore, a mismatch had to be supported by at least  <dig> reads in order to call the position heterozygous. the search identified  <dig>  positions of tcm and  <dig>  positions of tcc x <dig> that were heterozygous. taken together, genome heterozygosity levels of tcm and tcc x <dig> were ~ <dig> %  and ~ <dig> % , of which  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  were located in protein-coding genes.  <dig>  and  <dig>  heterozygous positions of tcm and tcc x <dig> were located at non-synonymous sites. gene ontology analysis was performed on genes containing at least one polymorphism at a non-synonymous site, resulting in two significantly enriched categories : go: <dig>  and go: <dig> . overall, the estimated level of heterozygosity of tcc x <dig> was slightly higher than previously reported
 <cit> , likely due to the increased sequence depth in the present study. in order to identify regions with higher density of heterozygosity, i.e. clustering of heterozygous sites, we counted the number of heterozygous positions inside  <dig>  bp windows. this indicated that heterozygosity often, but not exclusively, was located in clusters . in conclusion, heterozygosity of the tcm and tcc x <dig> were ~ <dig> % and ~ <dig> %, with some regions exhibiting higher than average heterozygosity. in contrast, the heterozygosity level of tcc clbr was ~ <dig> to 4% . in comparison to other kinetoplastids, the heterozygosity level is similar to that of leishmania braziliensis but higher than l. major and l. infantum <cit> . the generally low levels of heterozygosity found in many protozoans is difficult to explain in terms of a strictly clonal propagation model
 <cit> . such organisms would be expected to observe extensive divergence of homologous genomic copies, which is the case for bdelloid rotifers
 <cit> . in perspective, the b lineage of the human parasite giardia intestinalis exhibits relatively high heterozygosity 
 <cit>  whereas a and e lineages exhibit low heterozygosity 
 <cit> . the genome of the free-living amoeboflagellate naegleria gruberi was described as mosaic of homozygous and heterozygous regions, with an average polymorphism rate of  <dig> %
 <cit> . interestingly, asexual lineages of daphnia exhibit low levels of allelic divergence and appear to employ ameiotic recombination to eliminate heterozygosity faster than it accumulates
 <cit> . the mechanism for maintaining low heterozygosity in trypanosomatids remains unknown, but could involve cryptic sexuality, frequent local gene conversion or chromosome-wide conversion. the former can be evaluated via an assessment of population-level inter-locus linkage disequilibrium. nevertheless, descriptive data may not be sufficient to explain the causes of this phenomenon.

t. c. cruzi contain several highly expanded and complex gene families
 <cit> , comprised of transcribed genes and pseudogenes. several of these families have been reported to vary in copy number between strains
 <cit> . in the present study we compared gene family content between tcm and tcc x <dig> using the depth of aligned short reads. initially, repeat boundaries were determined using repeatmasker. subsequently, the percentages of reads mapping to repeat families were calculated . the statistical significance was assessed in the following way: an empirical distribution of genome-wide read-depth differences was established using regions of homology between tcm and tcc x <dig> . the software promer was used to find homologous regions. in each homologous region, the percentage read coverage was calculated for tcm and tcc x <dig>  these numbers were then corrected for the genome size and the coverage difference for each homologous region was computed.  <dig>  regions were included, with mean  <dig> e- <dig> and standard deviation  <dig> e- <dig>  the logspline function of the r package with the same name was used to fit a smoothed density curve to the data, and the plogspline function was used to determine p-values. six out of eight examined gene families were expanded in tcc x10: trans-sialidase; mucin-associated surface protein; retrotransposon hot spot protein; tcmuc mucin; abc transporter; and rna binding protein. on the contrary, gp <dig> and dispersed gene family  <dig>  were contracted in tcc x <dig>  the observation that dgf was contracted in tcc x <dig> was consistent with previous data when tcc x <dig> was compared with tcc clbr
 <cit> , which suggests a recent loss of dgf-related sequences in the lineage leading to tcc x <dig>  further examination of several dtu i strains may resolve if this is a general feature of this lineage. it is clear that at least part of the genome size difference can be attributed to expansion and/or contraction of these gene families. we performed a closer examination of the tcmucii mucin gene family. tcmucii mucin genes of the same genome were frequently found to be too different to align. we constructed entropy plots from alignment positions that were deemed as accurate, which revealed, as expected that 5′ and 3′ termini were more conserved and the internal parts of these genes were hypervariable .

d se=significantly enriched. refers to if one genome contained significantly more of this gene family. the significance was determined from an empirical distribution of read depth differences from homologous regions of tcm and tcc x <dig>  corrected for genome size. the empirical distribution was used to calculate a p-value.

kinetoplastid dna 
the mitochondrial genomes  of t. c. cruzi strains x <dig> , esmeraldo  and clbr  have been sequenced, and have provided insights into the structure and organization of kinetoplastid dna of these strains
 <cit> . the t. c. marinkellei maxicircle was identified as a  <dig>  bp contig from the  <dig> assembly. the length of this sequence was slightly longer  than those previously reported, and the difference was attributed to variability in the repetitive region. the coding region of the tcm maxicircle was syntenic with the coding regions of the three complete t. c. cruzi maxicircle genomes, beginning with the 12s rrna gene and ending with the nd <dig> gene. the lengths of the individual genes within the tcm maxicircle coding region were comparable to those of the three t. c. cruzi strains . the length of the complete maxicircle coding region  for tcm was  <dig>  bp and began after  <dig>  bp of non-coding sequence. with respect to coding sequences, the average maxicircle nucleotide identity between tcm and tcc x <dig> was :  <dig> % ±  <dig> , between tcm and tcc clbr was  <dig> % ±  <dig>  and between tcm and tcc esmeraldo was  <dig> % ±  <dig>  . phylogenetic reconstruction of the maxicircles from tcm, tcc x <dig>  tcc clbr and tcc esmeraldo confirmed that the tcm maxicircle was slightly closer to tcc esmeraldo than tcc x10/clbr . the topology of the tree suggests that the esmeraldo maxicircle might represent the ancestral maxicircle lineage of t. c. cruzi.

the consensus maxicircle genome sequence is derived from the predominant nucleotide present across multiple read alignments at each position. however, this criterion disregards low abundance single nucleotide polymorphisms  and therefore masks minor maxicircle haplotypes , which has previously been reported from tcc x10
 <cit> . illumina reads were used to assess the presence/absence of minor tcm maxicircle haplotypes. in total, this identified  <dig>  reads that aligned to the tcm maxicircle. low levels of heteroplasmy were observed in the tcm maxicircle protein-coding region. twenty snps were identified among four genes  and one intergenic region . average read depth for each snp site was  <dig>  at heterozygous sites, the minor nucleotide was present among an average of  <dig> %  of reads. all snps were bi-variable except for at two intergenic positions, where two minor nucleotides were present. these observations imply the occurrence of at least two minor mitochondrial haplotypes.

gene content analysis and comparison
the tcm and tcc x <dig> genomes were annotated using a semi-automatic strategy, which relied on the previous annotation of the reference genome tcc clbr
 <cit> . gene models were transferred from tcc clbr to tcm and tcc x <dig> using perl scripts, reciprocal blastp searches together with positional information . in addition, gene prediction was performed and gene models were kept if one or more of the following criteria were satisfied:  the gene was conserved in a syntenic position in tcc clbr;  the gene shared homology with one or more gene families in tcc clbr; and  the gene was longer than  <dig> amino acids. gene models with complete overlap with another gene were discarded. the final annotations were manually inspected and refined with the artemis comparison tool
 <cit> . after this procedure, the genome sequences contained  <dig>   and  <dig>   protein coding gene annotations, of which  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  were syntenic with tcc clbr, tcm and tcc x <dig> respectively. with respect to coding sequences, the average nucleotide identity between tcm and tcc x <dig> was  <dig> % ±  <dig>  . when tcm was compared with tcc clbr esm and non-esm the average nucleotide identity was  <dig> % ±  <dig>  and  <dig> % ±  <dig> . these identities are based on a total of  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   orthologous gene pairs. ~86%  of the analyzed ortholog pairs had a nucleotide identity of 90% or higher. the ratio of non-synonymous and synonymous nucleotide substitutions  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in average , indicating as expected that most genes were under purifying  selection. a total of  <dig> genes showed ω values >  <dig> , indicating positive selection .

in order to identify isolate-specific genes, we compared the gene complements of the three genomes  using blast. initially, the predicted proteomes of tcm and tcc x <dig> were queried with blastp against the predicted proteome of tcc clbr using the e-value threshold 1e- <dig>  this resulted in  <dig>  and  <dig>  proteins longer than  <dig> amino acids that were not found in the tcc clbr proteome. these protein sequences were queried using tblastn against the tcc clbr genome to exclude the possibility that these putative genes were present as non-annotated open reading frames, using the same e-value threshold. this decreased the number of hits to  <dig>  and  <dig> . the composition of the  <dig> putative tcm-specific genes were as follows:  <dig> tcmucii mucin genes;  <dig> acetyltransferase ;  <dig> putative genes with weak hits to microbial sequences ; and  <dig> putative genes with no hits in public databases . for tcc x <dig>  one of the specific genes corresponded to a diverged mucin-associated surface protein . the remaining two putative genes did not show any significant hits in public databases . thus, the improved tcc x <dig> genome sequence facilitated the detection of two putative tcc x10-specific protein-coding genes not apparent in the earlier version. the two unknown genes were found to also be present in the previously reported draft genome sequence of tcc x10
 <cit> .

we used the same strategy to perform the reversed search, i.e. searching for genes specific for tcc clbr. this resulted in  <dig> and  <dig> protein sequences that were not found in tcm and tcc x <dig>  searches using tblastn towards tcm and tcc x <dig> further decreased this number to  <dig> and  <dig>  and of these  <dig> and  <dig> were mucin-associated surface proteins or tcmucii mucin.  <dig>  and  <dig>  contained low complexity repeats. the remaining  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were queried against the raw  <dig> reads of tcm and tcc x <dig>  which further decreased the number of tcc clbr specific genes to  <dig> that were not present in tcm . the  <dig> genes were uncharacterized . the tcc clbr-specific genes, compared with tcc x <dig>  were identical to those previously reported
 <cit> . in conclusion, the total number of specific genes was remarkably low in relation to the number of coding sequences in these genomes. as a perspective, comparative genomics of t. brucei brucei and t. brucei gambiense did not identify any gene that could explain the ability to infect different species, despite interspecific pathological variation
 <cit> .

a specific acetyltransferase gene in t. c. marinkellei
as mentioned above, a  <dig>  bp acetyltransferase gene  was found among the  <dig> unique genes in tcm. this gene was identified in a single copy on scaffold  <dig> and was missing in t. c. cruzi. alignment of scaffold  <dig> from tcm with tcc clbr showed that it aligned close to the end of chromosome  <dig> and was flanked by viper elements and an atpase gene . to exclude the possibility that moq_ <dig> was not properly assembled in t. c. cruzi, we searched raw 454/illumina reads from tcc x <dig> and raw sanger reads from tcc clbr. this confirmed that moq_ <dig> was not present in these genomes. domain searches of moq_ <dig> revealed the presence of a cas1p domain  and multiple trans-membrane domains. in genbank, the best hit from protein blast was to the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii, containing 44% sequence identity over  <dig> amino acids .  <dig> iterations of psi-blast resulted in hits to various species of plants and algae. the best ten hits were to the enzyme o-acetyltransferase, displaying protein identities between ~37-39% . this indicated that moq_ <dig> has either diverged since the transfer to tcm or that it has been transferred from a species not contained in genbank, of which the latter seems the most likely. furthermore, transcription of moq_ <dig> was detected with reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction .

a the best hit from the ncbi conserved domain database.

phylogenetic reconstruction of moq_ <dig> demonstrated that the closest known homologs were from various species of algae and plants , and the absence of exon-intron boundaries suggested that it was transferred as a spliced mrna. no homologs were found in trypanosoma rangeli , rhodnius prolixus  or myotis lucifugus . the gc content of moq_ <dig> was  <dig> %, which was significantly lower than the average of  <dig> % ±  <dig>  . the gc content of the first, second and third codon positions were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, in contrast to the global levels:  <dig> % ±  <dig>  ,  <dig> % ±  <dig>   and  <dig> % ±  <dig>  . hence, the gc content of moq_ <dig> was unusually low in relation to the global gc content of all tcm genes. in conclusion, this suggested that the nucleotide composition of moq_ <dig> was distinct compared with all other genes of the tcm genome. the unusual gc content can be interpreted as an imprint from the originating genome.

codon adaptation index  is a measure of synonymous codon usage bias and can be used to evaluate the extent of which codon usage of a supposed foreign gene is similar to highly expressed genes in the host genome
 <cit> . cai can range between  <dig> and  <dig> and values closer to  <dig> imply equal use of synonymous codons whereas values closer to  <dig> imply strong codon usage bias. moq_ <dig> displayed a cai value of  <dig>  . in contrast, the median cai across all genes was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . thus, cai was lower than the mean but still within the expected range, suggesting that the gene has conformed to the host genome.

overall, these findings point to that moq_ <dig> was acquired by the lineage leading to tcm rather than lost in t. c. cruzi and demonstrates an example of horizontal gene transfer between a photosynthesizing organism and a protozoan parasite. interestingly, a genome comparison of two strains of the protozoan giardia intestinalis also identified a strain-specific acetyltransferase
 <cit> . finally, the biological function of moq_ <dig>  if any, remains to be determined.

comparison of synteny reveals putative rearrangements
t. c. cruzi has previously been reported to exhibit extensive dna content and karyotype variability
 <cit> . we investigated sequence co-linearity of the assembled data and compared with the current chromosome-level assembly of tcc clbr. scaffolds > <dig> kb were extracted from the assemblies, which resulted in  <dig> and  <dig> scaffolds for tcm and tcc x <dig> respectively, amounting to  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the genomes. in order to identify putative inter- and intra-chromosome rearrangements, scaffolds were queried against tcc clbr  using the alignment program promer
 <cit> . the number of chromosome hits per scaffold was plotted and the results were inspected. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  scaffolds contained hits to more than one chromosome from tcc clbr. however, manual examination showed that the vast majority of these hits were to gene family members  or other repeats. hence, these were not likely to be rearrangements between chromosomes.  <dig> scaffolds were identified from tcm  and  <dig> from tcc x <dig>  that were involved in inter-chromosome rearrangements . moreover, tcm and tcc x <dig> both contained rearrangement in a region on chromosome  <dig>  containing a repeat-like composition in tcc clbr. scaffold  <dig> from tcm aligned with chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  scaffold  <dig> from tcc x <dig> aligned with chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  also, scaffold  <dig> from tcm aligned with the distal parts of tcc clbr chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  in tcm, viper elements were frequently found in regions where synteny was discontinued. regions where rearrangements had occurred were frequently found inside unidirectional gene clusters.

intra-chromosome rearrangements were searched for using the same strategy. this identified  <dig> and  <dig> scaffolds in tcm and tcc x <dig> respectively, where intra-chromosome rearrangements were identified. frequently, one or several genes were found to have shifted location and were found to be located distally on the same chromosome. in a few cases, a certain structural variant was present in tcm and tcc x <dig> but not in tcc clbr, suggesting that it was introduced in the lineage leading to tcc clbr. tcm scaffold  <dig> contained a large inverted region, flanked by viper elements. this inversion causes disruption of a head-to-head strand switch region. the larger number of structural rearrangements in tcm likely reflects its phylogenetic distance from t. c. cruzi.

pcr validation was performed in order to validate the accuracy of the assembly and some of the identified rearrangements. representative regions were selected from tcm, tcc x <dig> and tcc clbr and targeted for pcr amplification. the size of the pcr product was compared with the in silico expected size and confirm assembly consistency. in total,  <dig> of  <dig> genomic regions were successfully amplified from tcm,  <dig> of  <dig> from tcc x <dig> and  <dig> of  <dig> from tcc clbr . of which tcm yielded the following pcr product sizes:  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  kb. the first and second pcr products spanned across assembly gaps and therefore did not allow estimation of the expected sizes, but confirmed contigs to be accurately linked together. the third pcr reaction from tcm resulted in the expected product size of  <dig>  kb. tcc x <dig> resulted in pcr products of sizes  <dig>  kb and  <dig> kb, which were expected. the tcc clbr reaction resulted in the expected product size of  <dig> kb. two pcr reactions did not work, which could either be due to non-optimal pcr conditions, formation of primer-secondary structures/duplexes or misassembly.

it is important to note that the present analyses are limited by the sequence continuity of the particular scaffold and therefore the presented numbers of observed rearrangements are likely to be underestimates. in conclusion, the majority of analyzed genomic regions from tcm and tcc x <dig> exhibited conserved local synteny with tcc clbr. however, insertions, deletions or other types of structural alterations occasionally interrupted synteny. these observations suggest that different t. c. cruzi lineages contain distinct karyotypes and other types of structural features, which have been fixed in a certain lineage. the cause of these rearrangements could either be due to random processes, i.e. oxidative stress or mistakes introduced by spontaneous cellular processes or perhaps less likely, physiological processes. clearly, the presence of genetic variation other than snps provides an additional layer of complexity to studies of t. c. cruzi genetic variability.

widespread occurrence of copy number variation in tcm and tcc x10
copy number variation has been reported from t. c. cruzi strains
 <cit> . such variation may represent important strain-specific characteristics, yet little is known about how t. cruzi lineages differ in this aspect. in the present study we investigated the occurrence of copy number variation in tcm and tcc x <dig> using short read depth . rt-qpcr was used to confirm some of the identified variations. illumina reads were aligned to scaffolds > <dig> kb and a sliding window analysis was used to identify regions which exhibited higher than average coverage. coverage was calculated in  <dig> bp windows with  <dig> bp overlap, i.e. the coverage of each position in the window was summed and log10-scaled. the baseline coverage was determined for each genome and was used to assess if a region displayed elevated coverage compared to the rest of the genome. the baseline was calculated as the median and median absolute deviation  of log10-scaled coverage from all windows of one genome. this resulted in the baseline coverage   <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for tcm and tcc x <dig> respectively. a duplicated region was defined as a stretch of  <dig>  bp containing at least  <dig> windows above 2x the median standard deviation from the baseline. if two or more stretches were adjacent to each other, these were merged and counted as one region. this identified  <dig> and  <dig> duplicated regions in tcm and tcc x <dig>  the duplicated region was not always restricted to one gene. on scaffold  <dig> , the amplified region was  <dig> kb and contained four coding sequences, including a nucleoside transporter and a dynein gene . the same region was also found amplified in tcc x <dig> . interestingly, a nucleoside transporter has been implicated in drug resistance in trypanosoma brucei <cit> . housekeeping-genes were also found amplified, for example, paraflagellar rod protein  <dig>  from tcm gave rise to a cnv signal. rt-qpcr with primers targeting this gene resulted in ct= <dig> , compared with ct= <dig>  for 8-oxoguanine dna glycosylase , which lacked a cnv signal. moreover, the prostaglandin f <dig> alpha synthase gene  gave rise to a cnv signal, and rt-qpcr resulted in ct= <dig> . in tcc x <dig>  one example of cnv is in the epsilon tubulin gene , for which rt-qpcr resulted in ct= <dig> . surface antigens were frequently found amplified; a mucin-like gene on scaffold  <dig> , a surface protease gp <dig> on scaffold  <dig> . scaffold  <dig>  contains an amplification of cystathionine beta-synthase, scaffold  <dig>  contains an amplification of nad-dependent steroid dehydrogenase, scaffold  <dig>  contains an amplification of ferric reductase. there was also evidence of differential copy number variation, suggesting amplification in one genome but not the other. one example is the amplification of a pyruvate phosphate dikinase on scaffold  <dig> in tcm, which does not give rise to a cnv signal in tcc x <dig> 

in order to identify chromosomal aneuploidies, we calculated the baseline coverage for each scaffold. scaffolds with a median < <dig>  and median absolute deviation < <dig>  were extracted . this identified  <dig> scaffolds in tcm with a lower average coverage:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these genomic regions were homologous with chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in tcc clbr. no scaffolds with low overall coverage were identified in tcc x <dig>  this suggested the existence of monosomic chromosomes in tcm but not in tcc x <dig>  as expected, heterozygosity was absent in these putatively monosomic tcm regions. however, the homologous region in tcc x <dig> displayed heterozygosity. this further supported the likely monosomic state of these regions in tcm. genomic qpcr with a primer pair targeting scaffold  <dig> in tcm resulted in ct= <dig>  for the putative monosomic scaffold, whereas for putative disomic regions on scaffold  <dig> and  <dig> ct was  <dig>  and  <dig> . moreover, we searched for evidence of higher ploidy levels. scaffolds with median >  <dig>  were extracted. this identified  <dig> and  <dig> scaffolds in tcm and tcc x <dig> respectively, with an increased overall coverage. these scaffolds showed homology with large mega-base chromosomes from tcc clbr, suggesting that higher ploidy levels may be more common in larger chromosomes.

the presented analysis confirms that copy number variation is a common feature of the tcm and tcc x <dig> genomes. in theory, copy number variation would not be beneficial for the parasite as it increases the amount of dna that needs to be replicated and the energy cost of the cell. the evolutionary benefit of having such an excessive amount of genes would seem to be limited. it is possible that copy variation does not infer any evolutionary advantage for the parasite, but is only a consequence of sloppy or non-perfect dna replication mechanisms of these parasites.

retrotransposons, repetitive elements and low complexity repeats
transposons are present in most eukaryotes and contribute to genome size and plasticity
 <cit> . trypanosomatid genomes contain several families of dead and presumably active retrotransposons
 <cit> . tcm and tcc x <dig> were searched for  <dig> classes of repetitive elements, including retrotransposons.  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the assembled bases corresponded to repetitive elements in tcm and tcc x <dig> respectively .  <dig> of  <dig> repeat categories were more abundant in tcc x <dig>  with a total expansion factor of  <dig>  in this genome compared with tcm .

a the sum of masked base pairs in the assembly. the number inside parenthesis refers to the percentage of assembled bases.

b the percentage of short reads that was mapped on these features.

c se=significantly enriched. refers to if one genome contained significantly more of this gene family. the significance was determined from an empirical distribution of read depth differences from homologous regions of tcm and tcc x <dig>  corrected for genome size. the empirical distribution was used to calculate a p-value.

the long terminal repeat -like retroelement viper
 <cit>  belongs to the superfamily tyrosine recombinase retrotransposons
 <cit>  and was the most abundant element in tcm and tcc x <dig> respectively, representing  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the repetitive elements . the large amount of sequence related to these elements suggested that large-scale proliferation occurred before the split of t. c. cruzi and t. c. marinkellei. furthermore, phylogenetic reconstruction based on a multiple sequence alignment  indicated some substructure between tcc x <dig> and tcc clbr, whereas tcm in large formed a more distant clade . 69%  of the msa sites were too diverged to be included in the multiple-alignment, suggesting that these elements have been inactive for a substantial time. the human infecting lineage does contain a larger amount of these elements, possibly due to a loss of viper-related sequences in tcm. in conclusion, repetitive elements explain in part the smaller genome size of tcm.  <dig> repeat categories were on the contrary expanded in tcm; the  <dig> low-abundance repeats nartc and c <dig> and the abundant dire  element.

de novo repeat discovery was performed in order to identify unique sequence repeats, using the program repeatscout
 <cit>  and repeatmasker
 <cit> . repeatscout identified  <dig>   and  <dig>   repeats of variable lengths. these repeats were then filtered using these criteria; i) removal of repeats shorter than  <dig> bp, ii) removal of repeats containing more than 50% low complexity sequence, iii) removal of repeats with fewer than  <dig> genomic copies, iv) removal of known repeats . this decreased the number of hits to  <dig>  and  <dig>  using the outlined criteria. manual examination of the tcm repeats revealed that  <dig> corresponded to diverged tcc clbr sequences, including a spliced leader sequence and sequences related to masp and tcmucii mucin. we searched for these  <dig> repeats in the genome assemblies of tcc x <dig> and tcc clbr as well as in raw reads, which decreased the number of tcm-specific repeats to  <dig>  the length of the identified tcm-specific repeats varied between  <dig> to  <dig> bp, and blast searches resulted in non-significant hits to sequences of metazoan origin. these repeats were found exclusively on short contigs , corroborating the idea that the repetitive components of these genomes have evolved faster. we estimated the copy number of the two longest repeats, tcm-rep <dig>  and tcm-rep <dig>  from the depth of  <dig> read coverage mapped on these sequences. the average  <dig> read coverage  was then used to estimate copy number. the average read coverage was  <dig> reads/position for tcm-rep <dig> and  <dig>  reads/position for tcm-rep <dig>  hence, the estimated copy number became  <dig> and  <dig> for tcm-rep <dig> and tcm-rep <dig> respectively. taken together, these two repetitive elements contribute ~ <dig> kb of sequences to the tcm genome and also represent a large set of putative tcm-specific sequences. since the repeats were not found in tcc x <dig> and tcc clbr, it is possible that a loss has occurred in the lineage leading to the human infective t. c. cruzi.

t. c. marinkellei invades non-bat epithelial cells in small numbers and divides intracellularly
experimental infections were performed on three mammalian cell lines to further understand the potential of tcm to invade non-bat derived cells. the following lines of epithelial cells were used; vero cells , ok cells  and tb1-lu cells . tcm metacyclic trypomastigotes were incubated overnight with cells from each cell line . extra- and intracellular parasites were immunolabelled using tcm and tcc positive sera and anti-whole cell body antibody . in parallel, intracellular parasites were stained with giemsa dye. both experiments independently showed that tcm is capable of invading each of the three cell lines. tcm did not show a particular preference for the bat cell line.

we also investigated the ability of tcm to replicate intracellularly using the same cell lines. the human infective tcc was included as a positive control. infected cells were incubated over a  <dig> day time course, the development of intracellular amastigotes during this period indicated that tcm is capable of intracellular proliferation . amastigogenesis and amastigote proliferation of tcm following metacyclic invasion appeared to be analogous to tcc controls. these data suggested that tcm is capable of infecting other cells than strictly those from bats, and hence, that the infection is not blocked by species-specific host cell tropism mediated at the level parasite entry. in conclusion, the infection barrier must therefore arise in a different context, though whether this relates to different aspects of tcm specific biology or as physiological or immunological differences between hosts, or as a combination of both, remains to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first genome analysis of a non-human associated member of schizotrypanum. our aim was to identify genome sequence differences that may relate to host specificity or other phenotypical differences, as well as to further understand the evolution of these parasite lineages. we found a slightly smaller genome of t. c. marinkellei compared with the human infective strains, although it remains an open question if this is a general tendency among bat-associated trypanosomes. t. c. marinkellei and t. c. cruzi shared the same set of core genes, i.e. there were no missing coding sequences in terms of housekeeping genes. on the contrary, several gene families were expanded in t. c. cruzi sylvio x <dig>  contributing to the larger genome size. this suggested that t. c. cruzi sylvio x <dig> have a more versatile toolbox of surface antigens, which may reflect an adaptation to its host. interestingly, one subspecies specific acetyltransferase gene was identified in t. c. marinkellei, containing detectable homology with genes from photosynthesizing organisms. it appears likely that this gene was acquired after the split of t. c. cruzi and t. c. marinkellei, since the gene was missing from t. c. cruzi strains sylvio x <dig> and cl brener. the gene represents a rare example of gene transfer between distantly related eukaryotes and may provide additional functionality to t. c. marinkellei. future efforts will be required to understand its function. considering the divergence time between t. c. marinkellei and t. c. cruzi , remarkably few absolute gene differences were present. this suggests that the core gene content of t. cruzi lineages is relatively stable, whereas the repetitive component is allowed to undergo more rapid changes. the low number of subspecies specific genes suggests that phenotypic variation, like host specificity, might be encoded by more discrete variation, e.g. via non-synonymous nucleotide variants leading to specific protein isoforms. the difficulty to explain how the genome encodes phenotypes like host-specificity is further illustrated by our finding that t. c. marinkellei invades non-bat cells, which indicates that the machinery to invade host cells is functionally conserved. the two subspecies t. c. marinkellei and t. c. cruzi were on average ~ <dig> % diverged in coding sequences with respect to single nucleotide differences. the large number of small nucleotide differences may have implications on phenotypic variation via the formation of new alleles. the present study has provided many new candidate genes, including putative antigens that can provide starting points for functional investigation of phenotypic variation of these parasite lineages.

extensive copy number variation of various genes was identified. copy number variation has been suggested as means for the parasite to increase gene expression in the absence of transcriptional regulation. these findings are not surprising and are corroborated by the long-standing knowledge of genomic variability in t. c. cruzi <cit> . it is possible that phenotypes may be encoded at the transcriptional level. interestingly, the t. c. marinkellei and t. c. cruzi genomes also contained variation in the amounts of non-coding repeats, related to retroelements and other previously uncharacterized repeats. as these differences were substantial, it remains plausible that whole chromosomes or chromosomal chunks have been lost in t. c. marinkellei. none of the larger chromosomes were missing, suggesting that smaller chromosomes harboring surface antigens or other repeats have been lost. the plasticity of the t. cruzi karyotype is further demonstrated by the fact that certain chromosomes appear to be monosomic in one subspecies but not in the other. the existence of such monosomic chromosomes reduces allelic redundancy and might have implications on transcript abundance. karyotype variability therefore stands as another possible source of phenotypic variation. finally, the amount of intraspecific genetic variation identified in this study is likely to represent only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the actual genetic variation present in natural reservoirs.

taken together, the presented draft genomes raise further questions about genome evolution and diversity in this group of protozoa, and the putative functional implications of this variation. further exploration of the genetic diversity within schizotrypanum should therefore be a future priority as this may help to resolve complex relationships between parasites, vectors and hosts. the decreasing cost and time for whole genome sequencing should therefore pave the way for further large-scale efforts to understand the underlying genetic basis of these parasites.
