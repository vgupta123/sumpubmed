BACKGROUND
the large genotyping studies in the last decade have revolutionize genetic studies. our current ability to characterize the human genome is unprecedented  <cit> , and is contributing to improve our understanding of the genetic etiology of common diseases.

genetic admixture is one of the caveats for genetic association studies  <cit> , and has fostered the comparative study of the genetic structure of different human populations. a large number of studies are underway to identify the similarities and differences among existing human populations  <cit> . these studies started comparing the general human populations such as africans, asians and europeans, but have recently focused on the more specific subgroups within them  <cit> . it seems that, as genetically similar as humans are, we can now tune the genetic "microscope" so that subtle genetic differences among related subpopulations can be detected  <cit> , even among regions within a country  <cit> .

the neocodex biobank and genome research consortium is planning a number of genome-wide association studies  in several complex phenotypes. our basic and general strategy will consist in the systematic comparison of a well-characterized population-based control dataset against a number of datasets of complex phenotypes, such as metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, alzheimer's disease, colorectal cancer or multiple sclerosis. therefore, it is markedly important to select individuals representative of the genetic diversity co-existent in spain and to make an in-depth genomic characterization of these control individuals that will serve as a reference panel for future gwas studies.

as an initial step of our investigation, we decided to characterize the genetic structure of the spanish population using high density snp arrays. this study lays an essential base for future gwas, by identifying potential sources of bias that may affect experimental results and that could increase the noise and false positive rate of gwas in our population. furthermore, this work begins the characterization of common copy number variants  in our population that might interfere with association studies in discrete regions of the genome or that may be related to the phenotypes by itself.

in this study, we have analyzed linkage disequilibrium  patterns and haplotype blocks in the population of spain, and compared them to western and northern europeans. we have also estimated population stratification and substructure, and have identified cnvs in this sample of the spanish population.

RESULTS
 <dig> spanish individuals were genotyped with the affymetrix nsp i  <dig> k chip, from which  <dig>  snps passed the quality control filters, and were used in the ld, haplotypic and structure analyses described below. in addition, genotype data from the hapmap project were used for comparison purposes: we selected the genotypes from the same chip for  <dig> unrelated ceu individuals. moreover, subsets of hapmap individuals with european, african, and asian ancestry were employed in the principal components analysis.

allele frequencies
the average minor allele frequency  across all autosomal snps  was almost identical to that of the ceu hapmap sample . the distribution of maf is not uniform.  <dig> %  of the snps were monomorphic,  <dig> %  were rare alleles , and  <dig> %  were low-frequency alleles . the distribution of the remaining, common snps  was more uniform, although frequency declines as maf increases. figure  <dig> compares the maf distributions between the spanish  and ceu hapmap samples, showing that the frequency distribution of common snps  are very similar.

ld and haplotypic structure
it is well known that ld decreases exponentially with genetic distance, and this pattern is confirmed in the spanish population analyzed in this study. figure  <dig> represents visually this ld decay. specifically, for snps up to  <dig> kb apart, ld is large . for snps up to  <dig> kb apart, the average d' is  <dig>  . for markers between  <dig> and  <dig> kb apart, the average d' decreases to  <dig>  . moreover, for markers  <dig> kb- <dig> mb apart, the average d' is only  <dig>  . this general pattern shows, nonetheless, large variability . for example, maximal ld  can be exceptionally observed across pairs of markers several mb away. but in general, high ld  is very rare over distances of  <dig> kb or above. on the other side of the scale, low ld  can be observed in markers less than  <dig> kb apart. these values are similar to those obtained from the ceu hapmap nsp i 250k dataset, but ld is greater in the ceu sample, especially for markers farther apart  . this is possibly due to the smaller size of the ceu sample , where less chromosomes are represented, and thus less chances exist of a recombination event breaking long-range ld.

beyond pair-wise ld patterns, haplotype blocks give a more global description of ld structure. in this sample that represents the population of spain, we have estimated  <dig>  haplotype blocks in the  <dig> autosomal chromosomes. a list of haplotype blocks, including haplotype frequencies, ld between adjacent haplotypes, and multiallelic ld between adjacent blocks, is included as additional file  <dig>  each block covers  <dig>  snps on average, ranging from small blocks of only  <dig> snps to some very large blocks of as much as  <dig> snps. this largest block is located in chromosome 17q <dig> : <dig> ,235- <dig> , <dig>  between rs <dig> and rs <dig>  this 17q <dig>  region is a gene-rich region  exhibiting large ld blocks  in the hapmap phase ii dataset in all populations studied , and with an interesting evolutionary story involving a large inversion  <cit> .

the number of blocks  and block size  per chromosome, summarized in table  <dig>  is quite variable among the chromosomes. the block structure in the spanish population is in general similar to that of the ceu hapmap sample, but with important differences. the spanish sample exhibits more but smaller blocks than the ceu sample. this finding, again, may be a consequence of the difference in sample size. the more chromosomes represented in the spanish sample may reveal recombination events that break down blocks, while these same blocks in the ceu sample may extend further distances.

the number of blocks, total and average block size, and proportion of chromosome covered by blocks in the spanish  and ceu samples.

nonetheless, it is noteworthy that a larger portion of the genome is covered by blocks in the spanish sample , than in the ceu sample . again, the percentage of chromosomes covered by blocks is quite variable across the chromosomes, ranging between  <dig> % for chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> % for chromosome 6q.

population stratification
population stratification was analyzed with the structure and eigensoft softwares. two sets of snps were analyzed: subset a consists of  <dig>  unlinked snps, while subset b includes  <dig>  snps selected under less stringent criteria for marker relatedness.

analyzing the same subset of markers  with eigensoft resulted in similar conclusions. figure  <dig> shows the distribution of the  <dig> individuals according to the top  <dig> principal components. individuals from each recruiting center are coded by a different color. although recruiting centers are widely distributed across spain, the distribution of individuals from different geographic regions clearly overlap in the graph, suggesting there are no major differences between them. the tracy-wisdom test was borderline significant for the first pc  and non-significant for the second .

running pc analysis on marker subset b offers quite a different picture. as shown in figure  <dig> the distribution of individuals from the two most geographically distant recruiting centers  is quite different in this analysis. the province of málaga is located in the south of spain while vic  is north-east of spain, and they are located  <dig> km apart. we also observe a less striking gradient represented by individuals from arévalo , but not from the small number of individuals  from avilés  who geographically are located farther apart in this direction. all other centers are located both geographically and on this plot somewhere in between málaga and vic. as expected, when european hapmap datasets are included , spanish samples from different centers appear closer together in the graph. however the south to north-east axis  observed in figure  <dig> is still appreciated in this analysis and seems to correspond to a more general continent-wide south-west to north-east axis . figure  <dig> shows the result of the pc analysis when hap map datasets with african and asian ancestry are also included. returning to the analysis of the spanish population, and in order to evaluate graphically the resemblance of this genetic distribution to the geographic distribution of the recruiting centers, the pc axes have been flipped horizontally, rotated  <dig> degrees clockwise, and superimposed over a map of spain in which the location of the recruiting centers have been marked with large colored dots . to aid visualization, only individuals from recruiting centers contributing more than 10% of the total sample size are shown, according to the same two pcs from figure  <dig>  tracy-wisdom test were extremely significant for the top  <dig> pcs .

cnv
a total of  <dig>  cnvs were identified in our sample set . with the aim of avoiding as much false positive results as possible, we will only consider here those  <dig> cnvs present in, at least, three individuals .

overall, those cnvs span  <dig>  mb of human autosomal genome and chromosome x. mean  and median sizes for those variants are  <dig>   kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively, with a range of  <dig>  kb to  <dig> . <dig> kb. population frequency ranges from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, but only  <dig> cnvs have frequencies above 1%. most of the cnvs detected are copy number gains , followed by copy number losses , and copy number gains and losses . we did not detect any difference in mean population frequencies among copy number states. however, copy number losses are lower in size than copy number gains .

some of the cnvs identified in this study  overlap fully or partially with previously described structural variants. the mean  and median nucleotide coverage of identified cnvs by previous cnvs  are 60%  and 87%, respectively. there is a positive correlation among the population frequency of the cnvs and their base pair coverage by previously detected structural variants . we detected  <dig> new cnvs  and none of them were above  <dig> % of population frequency.

it has been proposed that genomic regions flanked by segmental duplications   are susceptible to structural variations by nonallelic homologous recombination   <cit> . to investigate whether nhr could account for some of the cnvs in our sample set, we calculated the percentage of cnvs included in genomic rearrangement hotspots. these regions were defined as dna stretches of  <dig> kb to  <dig> mb in length, flanked by intrachromosomal sd >  <dig> kb in size, in a similar way than sharp et al. . indeed we found that  <dig> cnvs  are included in rearrangement hotspots. interestingly, we observed that those cnvs are statistically more frequent than cnvs located out of rearrangement hotspots . in addition, the percentage of copy number states are statistically different among those two groups of cnvs, since those within rearrangement hotspots present a higher percentage of copy number gains and losses  when compared to cnvs out of these regions .

to analyse the impact of cnvs on genomic functional elements, we created a gene interval map comprising  <dig>  known genes  at autosomes and chromosome x.  <dig> cnvs  overlap at least one gene interval. it has been suggested that deletions are biased away from genes  <cit> . we observed that the median number of genes is lower in copy number losses  when compared to copy number gains  but this difference does not reach statistical significance in our sample set. we identified  <dig> cnvs overlapping  <dig> loci included at the morbidmap list ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/repository/omim/.

the impact of cnvs on genomic surveys was also assessed by analysing hardy-weinberg equilibrium  and missing genotype data. only a small proportion of the markers with hwe deviations  and markers with missing genotypes above  <dig>   are included in cnv regions.

discussion
this work has generated over  <dig> million genotypes, the largest study of this kind in spain. detailed information of the genetic structure of the spanish population will serve as a reference framework for future gwas studies in spain, and will be shared with other researchers via external national public health evaluation and approval.

we have characterized the genetic structure of the population of spain, describing genome-wide ld patterns, haplotype blocks, population structure and copy-number variants in a sample of over  <dig> unrelated spanish individuals. the individuals that participated in the study were recruited by a random sampling approach from a cross-sectional population-based epidemiological survey from eight locations in spain, representing different geographical locations across the country . the recruiting centers include both small rural clinics as well as large hospitals close to major metropolitan areas. individuals that reported a different nationality were not included in the study. therefore, the sample can be considered as representative of the general spanish population.

these samples were genotyped at neocodex with an affymetrix nsp i  <dig> k chip. the high call-rate  speaks of the high quality of the genotyping performed. although there are now commercial genotyping chips that provide a more complete coverage of the genome, at the starting point of this project this nsp i  <dig> k chip was the best possible choice, and provides enough genotype information for the current project.

ld and haplotypic structure
a major finding of the present study is that the spanish population is generally similar to the ceu hapmap sample , but also largely homogeneous within itself. numerous pieces of evidence point to this conclusion. for example, a significant proportion of the snps analyzed were monomorphic  or rare , even in this large sample of  <dig> individuals. in comparison, the ceu dataset yielded  <dig> % of monomorphic or rare snps, but in a much smaller sample of only  <dig> individuals . this large amount of snps with no or very little variability is a sign of the homogeneity of the spanish population.

the ld patterns observed in this sample of the spanish population is similar to the patterns observed in the ceu hapmap sample. this is not surprising since the level of genetic differentiation within europe is small  <cit> . we detect ld extending over large distances in the spanish population, but less than in the ceu sample. we have also found a large number  of haplotype blocks. these blocks are generally closely located to the blocks detected in the ceu sample, but in the spanish sample there are more blocks, and smaller on average. these findings could be an artefact due to the difference in sample size between the two samples, but may indeed be reflecting the more complex origin of the current spanish population  <cit> . indeed, these results confirm the suggestion that the spanish population has more haplotypic diversity than northern/western europeans  <cit> . this is a possible scenario, given that the iberian peninsula has been under large and long-lasting migratory influences, and admixture, from other european, mediterranean, and north african populations.

another interesting finding is that a larger portion of the genome is covered by blocks in the spanish sample , than in the ceu sample . this finding is again probably due to the larger spanish sample, so that the  <dig> chromosomes analyzed probably revealed more rare haplotypes, therefore enlarging the proportion of the chromosome covered by haplotype blocks. this extra block coverage in the spanish sample may turn useful for association studies, although this is probably a characteristic of other large homogeneous samples.

these results suggest that the general spanish population, as characterized in the present study by sampling from eight different cities widely-spaced across spain, is generally similar to other european populations, although more genetically diverse than western and northern europeans. moreover, the spanish population is remarkably homogeneous within itself in terms of global genetic structure. in view of these results, the population of spain is sufficiently genetically similar to the ceu sample so that the ceu hapmap dataset could be used to infer genotypes for the spanish population. nonetheless, in spite of their general similarity, there are substantial differences between these two european subgroups, and therefore imputed data from the hapmap study many not describe some particular genetic patterns of the spanish population. the dataset in this study can be extremely useful to compare allele and haplotype frequencies against the ceu sample, and to estimate the confidence of imputed genotypes in all regions of the genome. it is important to note here that some of the differences found between the spanish and the ceu samples may be due to the difference in size among both samples.

population stratification
the results of our population structure analyses are consistent with no major population stratification present in this sample of the spanish population. this result is reassuring since individuals reporting nationalities other than spanish were excluded from the study. both, structure and pc results with a set of  <dig>  uncorrelated snps showed no evidence of genetic diversity in the sample.

in addition, we were able to analyze fine structure within this sample by running pc analysis using a large set of markers . the results of this second analysis are also consistent with prior reports that were able to predict locations of origin within a  <dig> km radius using different european populations  <cit> , and other studies that found subtle differences between locations within a country  <cit> . in our sample, following a similar strategy, we were able to differentiate between the two more geographically distant centers. furthermore, these observed differences seem to correspond to the same geographical axis that has been previously found in european populations. this fine structure can be the result of genomic regions that show strong geographic variation  <cit>  and may be more evident in small, rural or isolated samples than in major cities where subpopulations tend to mix  <cit> . this potential source of bias should be taken into account in association studies. it is worth noting that our sample of the spanish population was quite homogeneous, and the genomic inflation factor , as estimated by the software plink  <cit> , was exactly  <dig>  as expected when only one population is being analyzed, but still specific genomic regions need to be carefully reviewed.

cnv
we have also defined the first cnv map in the spanish general population. according to our data,  <dig> % of the human genome  is susceptible to structural variants. this estimation is in range with previously published studies analysing structural variants with the affymetrix platform  <cit> .

we detected a wide range of cnvs population frequencies, although only  <dig> % of these variants had a population frequency above 1%.  <dig> of the cnvs described in this work are fully covered by previously described structural variants. in addition, another ten cnvs have 90% or more of their nucleotides represented in previous cnvs. these  <dig> cnvs are therefore supported by at least one independent study. the remaining  <dig> cnvs are also included in additional file  <dig> but for descriptive purposes only. these cnvs need to be confirmed in independent datasets. indeed, because we have analyzed  <dig> samples, some of these cnvs could be low frequency or population specific variants which went undetected in previous studies with smaller sample sets.

we have confirmed in this study that nonallelic homologous recombination  could explain the origin of about 33% of cnvs. interestingly, those cnvs are more frequent than other variants out of rearrangement hotspot regions and they represent  <dig> % of all cnvs detected in this study. regardless of the frequency of nhr events, we estimate that a considerable proportion of cnvs in the normal population may be a consequence of nhrs.

most of the cnvs detected in our study overlap with known genes, and of those,  <dig> cnvs  overlap with  <dig> disease loci. this observation is in agreement with previous results. for instance, the  <dig>  structural variant regions included in dgv overlap  <dig> disease loci. there exist several plausible reasons for these observations, such as the existence of false positives in cnv genome-wide surveys, inaccurate disease-frequency estimates, embryonic lethality effect for homozygous deletions of specific genes, misclassification of samples as normal controls, and rescue of the altered gene function by other related gene product  <cit> .

in our sample set, only  <dig>  cnvs overlapping disease loci have a population frequency above 1%, and none of them include homozygous deletions. from those, only three cnvs exceed 10% in population frequency and all of them are completely covered by previously described structural variants. two of these cnvs are contiguous on chromosomal region 15q <dig> , one of the most unstable regions in the human genome  <cit> . these two cnvs overlap the genes hect domain and rld  <dig>  associated with skin, hair and eye pigmentation , and bcl <dig> b-cell cll/lymphoma  <dig>  which has been implicated potentially in b-cell lymphoma . the third cnv is located at 19p <dig>  and overlaps with the gene rnaseh2a ribonuclease h <dig>  subunit a  whose mutations may be responsible for the aicardi-goutieres syndrome . interestingly, this is a severe autosomal recessive disorder that mimics in utero viral infections and therefore its real incidence could be underestimated  <cit> .

all these data suggest that some disease loci could be located within genomic regions that are prone to structural alterations. this observation has potential implications on the molecular diagnosis and on the disease frequency estimations of the phenotypes.

finally, our results suggest that structural variants could be responsible for a small percentage of the hardy-weinberg deviations and missing genotypes commonly observed in genome-wide surveys. therefore, it is advisable to consider the existence of such structural variants for specific snps when genome wide association studies are  performed.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have performed a deep characterization of our reference control population for gwas and confirmed that the spanish population is sufficiently homogeneous to conduct genetic association studies with minor risk of population stratification. in addition, the results obtained, together with other concomitant efforts underway in other european countries, will be useful to shed light on the nature of european genetic diversity and the spanish population genomic history. complete data and further details of our study, including raw genotypes, can be accessed after external ethical committee review and public administrative authorisation.
