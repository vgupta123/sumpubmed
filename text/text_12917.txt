BACKGROUND
fish egg quality can be defined as the ability of the egg to be fertilized and subsequently develop into a normal embryo. the egg's potential to produce a viable and normal embryo can be affected by many environmental and biological factors acting at various steps of the oogenetic process . the determinism of egg quality has also been shown to be under the influence of genetic factors  <cit> . while the effects of many experimental factors have been studied, the mechanisms by which they trigger egg quality losses are far less documented. yolk composition as a result of a specific diet has been intensively studied in several fish species in relationship with egg developmental capacities  <cit> . hormones of maternal origin supplied to the embryo by the egg also have a significant effect on embryonic development as shown by several studies  <cit> . in contrast, the putative role of non-yolky cytoplasmic components accumulated during oogenesis, such as structural and regulatory proteins, cortical alveoli content and messenger rnas , has received far less attention  <cit> . nevertheless, maternal mrnas that accumulate in the oocyte during oogenesis are essential for early embryonic development  <cit> . like in other animals, some maternal mrnas are involved in embryonic germ cells formation in fish  <cit> , but other oocyte mrnas, such as those involved in growth regulation, could be necessary to ensure a normal early development  <cit> . thus, in bovine two-cell embryos, a relationship between embryonic developmental competence, assessed in terms of time of first cleavage, and the expression of igf <dig> mrna was reported  <cit> . in addition, other studies showed a relationship between variation of maternal rna polyadenylation levels and developmental competence of mammalian oocytes, thus pointing out a relationship between maternal mrna stability and embryonic developmental capacities  <cit> . in fish, the possibility that specific oocyte mrnas might be affected when egg quality is experimentally decreased has been seriously suggested by a previous work dealing with the effect of egg post-ovulatory ageing on the mrna levels of many genes  in rainbow trout eggs  <cit> .

in fish, it is often useful or necessary to control the timing of spawning or induce the ovulatory process. these techniques are used for biotechnical, experimental or economical reasons to obtain out of season egg production and/or synchronous egg production within a group of females or, for some species, to obtain eggs from captive fish. the effects of these manipulations on fish egg quality have been thoroughly studied  <cit> . however, the impact on egg transcriptome as a result of these manipulations has received far less attention despite recent efforts to study the ovarian or follicular transcriptome during oogenesis  <cit> . in the present study, we analyzed the transcriptome of unfertilized rainbow trout  eggs after natural or controlled ovulation. two different protocols of controlled ovulation that are widely used in laboratories and fish farms were carried out:  a hormonal induction of ovulation using intra-peritoneal gnrh-analog injection, and  a specific photoperiod regime designed to advance the spawning period. in addition, a third group was not subjected to any specific manipulation to allow egg collection after natural spontaneous ovulation. for each individual female, egg samples were collected and either subjected to a microarray analysis or transferred in an experimental hatchery after fertilization for monitoring developmental success . thus, the present study aimed at  analyzing the effect of ovulation control processes on egg transcriptome and  analyzing possible links between egg transcriptome and egg developmental potential.

RESULTS
egg quality
both hormonal induction and photoperiodic manipulation of ovulation had a negative impact on egg quality. the percentage of normal  alevins monitored at yolk-sac resorption  was used to characterize the egg quality of each individual female. the higher percentage of normal alevins at ysr,  <dig> Â± 5%, was observed after natural  ovulation . in contrast, significantly lower percentages were observed after hormonal induction  of ovulation  or photoperiodic manipulation  of ovulation  .

transcriptomic analysis
after signal processing,  <dig> clones out of  <dig> were kept for further analysis. sam analysis was performed using the expression data of those  <dig> clones. twenty six genes exhibiting a differential mrna abundance among at least  <dig> of the  <dig> experimental groups were identified  with a false discovery rate  of  <dig> %. the ontologies of those genes are presented in table  <dig>  thirty one genes putatively linked to egg quality were identified  with a fdr of 30%. the ontologies of those genes are presented in table  <dig> 

real-time pcr analysis
from the  <dig>  genes identified in the transcriptomic analysis,  <dig> were ultimately kept for real-time pcr analysis . real-time pcr data corresponding to the remaining  <dig> was not used in the analysis because of methodological reasons .

genes exhibiting a differential egg mrna abundance among experimental groups
among the  <dig> genes exhibiting a differential mrna abundance between experimental groups,  <dig> were studied by real-time pcr. among those  <dig> genes,  <dig> were found to be differentially expressed in the real-time pcr study . the identity of those  <dig> genes is presented below. only the informative alignments obtained using the full rainbow trout coding sequence  or a substantial part of the cds are presented . for clarity reasons, the official human protein symbol was used in the text.

clone # 1rt65f10_d_c <dig> exhibited significant sequence similarity with mouse apolipoprotein c-i precursor  and was significantly more abundant in eggs of the hi group than in eggs of the n group while intermediate levels were observed in eggs of the pm group. the mrna abundance in the hi group was  <dig> times higher than in the n group while it was  <dig> times higher than in the pm group . after performing a blast search in the genbank database, the complete rainbow trout amino acid sequence deduced from the est sequence exhibited 54% sequence identity at the amino acid level with the zebrafish  cognate protein . a sequence identity of  <dig> and 26% was observed with mouse and human proteins respectively . the number of amino acids deduced from the trout est is consistent with the number of amino acids present in mammalian and zebrafish sequences.

a similar expression pattern was observed for clone # 1rt68d18_d_b <dig> that exhibited sequence similarity with mouse hemopoietic cell kinase . the deduced partial amino acid sequence generated from the corresponding unigene cluster exhibited 40% and 38% identity with mouse and human hck proteins respectively.

clone tcbk <dig> o. <dig> exhibited sequence similarity with hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase cytoplasmic  and was less abundant in eggs of the hi group than in eggs of the  <dig> other experimental groups . a contig sequence was generated using all rainbow trout ests belonging to the same unigene cluster . this contig sequence was then used to perform a blastx search in genbank. this contig sequence corresponded to a partial cds of the putative rainbow trout cdna. the deduced rainbow trout amino acid sequence exhibited 59% identity with the mouse brain protein  <dig> isoform  <dig> . this mouse protein is also known as myofibrillogenesis regulator  <dig>  in addition a 60% identity was observed with human cognate protein  know as myofibrillogenesis regulator  <dig> .

discussion
microarray analysis efficiency and reliability
the hybridization of radiolabeled cdnas with cdnas deposited onto nylon membranes has been used for several decades. however, the use of nylon cdna microarrays is not very common in comparison to glass slide microarrays. nevertheless, this technology has successfully been used for several years  <cit> . in our laboratory, we have successfully used this technology to identify differentially expressed genes during oocyte maturation and ovulation  <cit> . in the present study, we have used the same methodology and have identified a group of  <dig> genes exhibiting differential egg mrna abundance after natural controlled ovulation with a false discovery rate of  <dig> %. using real-time pcr, the egg mrna abundance of  <dig> genes was analyzed. among those  <dig> genes, only  <dig> exhibited expression patterns totally inconsistent with microarray data. in contrast, the expression patterns of the other genes were very similar to microarray data, even though observed differences were not always significant. it is noteworthy that the  <dig> genes exhibiting inconsistent expression patterns between pcr and microarray experiments correspond to uncharacterized proteins. indeed, one of the genes  had no significant hit in the swiss-prot database while the other one  had a significant hit with a hypothetical yeast protein . to conclude, the overall consistency of pcr and microarray data suggests that the microarray analysis performed in the present study is robust and reliable.

genes exhibiting a differential mrna abundance after natural or controlled ovulation
hormonal induction of ovulation
among identified genes, apoc <dig> and hck were the most affected by a hormonal-induction of ovulation. thus, the egg mrna abundance of those  <dig> genes was dramatically increased after hormonal induction of ovulation in comparison to natural ovulation . human apocs are protein constituents of chylomicrons, very low density lipoproteins, and high-density lipoproteins  <cit> . the human apoc <dig> protein is predominantly expressed in liver and adipose tissue  <cit> . apoc <dig> may modulate the activity of plasma enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. besides, apoc <dig> has also been reported to interfere with the apoe-dependent hepatic uptake of lipoprotein remnants by the low density lipoprotein receptor  and ldlr-related protein  <cit> . interestingly, it was previously shown in rainbow trout that the same clone of the apoc <dig> gene was significantly up-regulated in the ovary at the time of oocyte maturation  <cit> . this could be related to the arrest of lipoproteins uptake by the oocyte at the end of vitellogenesis concomitantly with a decrease of the expression of vitellogenin receptor  <cit> . it is therefore possible that the hormonal induction of ovulation induces an artificial over abundance of some hormonally-dependent genes, such as apoc <dig>  in the eggs. however, the possible consequences of such an over abundance on lipid metabolism of the embryo is so far unknown.

similarly to apoc <dig>  the egg mrna abundance of hck gene was also dramatically increased after hormonal induction of ovulation. hck, hemopoietic cell kinase, belongs to src-familly tyrosine kinases and is expressed in cells of myelomonocytic lineage, b lymphocytes, and embryonic stem cells. it was previously shown that the conventional progesterone receptor could interact, in a progestin-dependent manner, with various signaling molecules, including src tyrosine kinases  <cit> . indeed, these authors used downregulated hck as a general model of the c-src family tyrosine kinases to investigate the mechanism of activation by conventional progesterone receptor. in addition, the participation of the conventional progesterone receptor in african clawed frog  oocyte maturation process was seriously suggested by two independent studies  <cit> . besides, src tyrosine kinase activation has been shown to be one of the earliest transcription-independent responses of xenopus oocytes to progesterone during in vitro induced maturation; a period when oocyte mrna content remains stable  <cit> . interestingly, we observed a dramatic over abundance of hck mrna in the eggs after hormonal induction of ovulation. to date, the significance of this over abundance as a result of hormonally-induced ovulation is unknown. however, it further demonstrates that the egg mrna abundance of specific genes can be dramatically affected by a hormonal induction of ovulation.

in addition to apoc <dig> and hck, eggs obtained after hormonal induction of ovulation were also characterized by higher ntan <dig> and lower mr- <dig> mrna abundance. however, the fold difference observed for those  <dig> genes was less important. in mice it has been shown that ntan <dig> encodes an n-terminal amidohydrolase specific for n-terminal asparagines, which is involved in ubiquitin-proteasome proteolysis termed as the n-end rule pathway  <cit> . n-end rule pathway determines metabolic instability of different proteins that contain a destabilizing n-terminal residue  <cit> . more specifically, a recent study suggested that an over expression of ntan <dig> using recombinant ntan <dig> adenovirus vector resulted in a marked decrease in the microtubule-associated protein  <dig>  expression in hippocampal neurons in rat  <cit> . regardless of the specific target of ntan <dig> in the oocyte, an increased expression of this enzyme should participate in protein turnover, and its regulation might be important for the normal development of the oocyte. the second gene, mr- <dig>  is a newly identified protein that interacts with contractile proteins and exists in human myocardial myofibrils  <cit> .

finally, the egg mrna abundance of rpl <dig> was higher after hormonal induction of ovulation. however, this difference was only significant in comparison with the pm group. the 60s ribosomal protein l <dig>  is one of the forty seven 60s ribosomal proteins present in eukaryotic organisms and often used as markers for phylogenetic studies and comparative genomics. those ribosomal proteins have been sequenced recently in catfish  and high similarities with mammalian ribosomal protein were found  <cit> . 60s ribosomal subunit participates in translational initiation in combination with 40s ribosomal subunit  <cit> . an insertional mutagenesis study carried out in zebrafish  reported this gene to be essential for early embryonic development. mutation of this gene resulted in small head/eyes mutants  <cit> . interestingly, when monitoring embryonic development in the present study, we noticed that many embryos originating from eggs of hormonally-induced females exhibited small eyes at eyeing stage. precise quantification of this phenomenon would be necessary to stress its relationship with rpl <dig> over abundance in the eggs.

photoperiodic control of ovulation
four genes exhibited differential egg mrna abundance after photoperiod treatment in comparison to natural ovulation. similarly to eggs obtained after hormonal induction of ovulation, eggs of the pm group also exhibited increased levels of apoc <dig> and hck. the differential abundance of both genes was high but less pronounced than after hormonally-induced ovulation. in addition eggs obtained after photoperiod manipulation of ovulation were also characterized by higher myo1b and pyc mrna abundance. according to the gene ontology analysis, myo1b is a cytoskeleton protein involved in nervous system development . it is also expressed in a wide variety of tissues including rat neonatal tissues  <cit> . the class i myosin, myo1b, is a calmodulin- and actin-associated molecular motor widely expressed in mammalian tissues  <cit> . myo1b can interact on the dynamic actin filament populations and might play a role in intracellular membrane trafficking  <cit> . myosin light chain has been recently suggested to participate in anchoring the 26s proteasome, a 26s multiprotein complex that catalyses the breakdown of polyubiquitylated proteins, to the actin cytoskeleton of goldfish oocyte  <cit> . degradation of proteins mediated by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays important roles in the regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle  <cit>  and can be involved in oocyte maturation and further embryonic cell cleavages.

pyruvate carboxylase  is a mitochondrial biotin-dependent carboxylase. in the adipose tissue and liver pyc participates in the citrate shuttle by which nadph equivalents are transported out of mitochondria to the cytosol for lipogenesis  <cit> . five alternative forms of rat pyruvate carboxylase cdnas have been identified in liver, kidney, brain, and adipose tissue and these are expressed in a tissue-specific manner  <cit> . in red seabream , pyc mrna was detected by northen blot analysis in heart, liver, muscle and ovary  <cit> . interestingly, it was previously shown that a photoperiod manipulation of spawning date was associated with a significantly higher occurrence of yolk-sac resorption defects  <cit> . together, these observations suggest a putative link between an abnormal stockpiling of pyc mrna in the egg and problems in the processing and/or use of yolk-sac lipidic stores. indeed, it was previously reported that non viable gilthead sea bream eggs have lower pyruvate carboxylase activity than viable eggs  <cit> .

genes exhibited an egg mrna abundance correlated with egg's developmental potential
from microarray data,  <dig> genes were identified as exhibiting an egg mrna abundance correlated with egg's developmental potential. however, the false discovery rate was elevated and those genes were considered as candidate genes requiring pcr validation. nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the ontological analysis of this group showed that  <dig> genes are involved in the regulation of transcription and others in cell proliferation/development and cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis. in addition, the correlation was confirmed for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes analyzed by real-time pcr: prohibitin  <dig> . in animals and yeast, prohibitins have been shown to play important roles in cell cycling and senescence. one of prohibitin  <dig> major role is to be a chaperone-like regulator of the aaa protease in the mitochondrial matrix that assists in the assembly of inner membrane complex  <cit> . in caenorhabditis elegans, phb proteins were showed to be essential during embryonic development and are required for somatic and germ line differentiation in the larval gonad  <cit> . moreover, deletions of the saccharomyces cerevisiae homologues, phb <dig> and phb <dig>  result in a decreased replicative lifespan, and a defect in mitochondrial membrane potential. the prohibitin protein has been immunolocalized in mammalian oocytes and embryos and suggested to have an antiproliferative activity  <cit> . besides, a higher immunoreactivity level was found in the nucleus of embryo that failed to develop normally in comparison to morphologically normal ones. in the present study, we observed a higher prohibitin  <dig> mrna abundance in eggs exhibiting the lowest developmental potential. this differential abundance in eggs of varying quality suggests that prohibitin  <dig> plays a role in the developmental potential of the embryo. further studies are needed to unravel the link between an overabundance of prohibitin  <dig> mrna in the eggs and a reduced egg developmental potential. thus, this overabundance could be the result of a reduced prohibitin  <dig> synthesis during oogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we successfully used rainbow trout cdna microarrays to analyze egg transcriptome after natural and controlled ovulation and in relationship with the developmental potential of the eggs. we showed that the control of ovulation using either a hormonal induction or a manipulated photoperiod could induce differences in the egg mrna abundance of specific genes.

in addition, we showed that the egg mrna abundance of prohibitin  <dig>  was negatively correlated with the developmental potential of the egg.

furthermore, the identity and ontology of identified genes provided significant hints that could result in a better understanding of the mechanisms associated with each type of ovulation control  or conserved mechanisms triggering a loss of egg developmental potential.
