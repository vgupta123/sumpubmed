BACKGROUND
adaptive divergence, driven by local adaptation to heterogeneous environments, has long been a fascinating topic in ecology and evolutionary biology  <cit> . local adaptation not only leads to adaptive divergence between populations, but may also drive the process of speciation, i.e., ecological speciation  <cit> . it is often difficult to determine the extent of genetic differences associated with divergent selection. however, recent advances in genomic approaches such as genome scans and targeted resequencing provide illuminating ways to discover genes and genomic regions that might be involved in divergent selection  <cit> . for example, using genome-wide scans, genes that might be responsible for adaptation to high-elevation hypoxia were found in human tibetan populations  <cit> . in addition, genes that might be associated with adaptation to serpentine soil have also been identified by genomic sequencing at the population level in the plant arabidopsis lyrata <cit> . moreover, targeted resequencing in a specific chromosome region implied a selective target locus between diversifying ecotypes  of the african malaria mosquito anopheles gambiae <cit> . those studies provide fresh insights into the genetic basis of adaptive evolution. however, genomic approaches are often applicable only to human or other model organisms for which genomic information is available. although the cost of de novo genomic sequencing is much reduced by innovative sequencing technologies , it is still out of the reach of studies of most non-model organisms which collectively represent the diversity and complexity of life forms.

to sequence a subset of the genome of a non-model organism, for example, the transcribed dna within a given set of tissues under specific developmental stages or environmental conditions  may be a good alternative approach. sequences of the transcriptome were used to develop polymorphic markers, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms  and simple sequence repeats , e.g.  <cit> . because markers developed from the transcriptome are associated with expressed genes, they may better reveal intra- and inter-populational functional variations and are therefore suitable for studies of adaptive diversification or local adaptation  <cit> . recent developments in rna sequencing technology , which take advantage of the deep sequencing power of ngs  and efficient bioinformatic computations  <cit> , have greatly enhanced the process of transcriptome characterization, and have turned transcriptome sequences into promising genetic resources for non-model organisms.

herein, we report the characterization of the transcriptome of an ecologically important avian species in east asia, the vinous-throated parrotbill . the vinous-throated parrotbill is one of the most widely distributed resident avian species in east asia  <cit> . it has a broad latitudinal and elevational distribution covering geographic ranges from northern indochina to southern siberia and from the eastern edge of the tibetan plateau to coastal china and the island of taiwan. it occupies various types of habitats in china, while its island subspecies  is also considered to occupy the widest niche of any bird species in taiwan with an extraordinary elevational distribution from sea level to  <dig> m  <cit> . a steep elevational gradient can lead to high environmental heterogeneity  within a short horizontal distance, which is considered a ‘natural laboratory’ with many resources that can be used to examine adaptive responses of populations to different environmental contexts  <cit> . the wide elevational distribution of p. w. bulomachus may provide a good system for addressing how divergent selection pressures posed by a steep elevational gradient may drive adaptive differentiation between populations living at different elevations.

in this study, we attempted to characterize the transcriptome sequenced from a single individual of p. w. bulomachus and explored its potential utility, for example, in developing genetic markers for use in future adaptive genetic studies. specifically, we assembled and annotated transcriptome from illumina short-read sequences and assigned them to different gene ontology  categories. putative genetic markers such as snps and ssrs were also identified from the transcriptome. despite only sequencing a single individual’s transcriptome, snps were identified through heterozygous sites of the assembled contigs. we then identified genes in our transcriptome database which also appeared in an a priori list of candidate genes that might respond to hypoxia  <cit>  and be involved in climate-related adaptation  <cit> , and matched them to specific go terms associated with environmental adaptation. sequences of these genes can be used to design targeted gene-resequencing experiments to detect the genetic signature of elevational adaptation in the vinous-throated parrotbill. our results demonstrate that transcriptome sequences, even from a single individual, can serve as a rich genetic resource to investigate ecological and evolutionary processes.

RESULTS
transcriptome assembly
we received approximately  <dig>  ×  <dig> base pairs  of sequence data, composed of  <dig> , <dig> reads with an average length of  <dig>  bp. base call accuracy for most of the reads  reached a threshold of 99% . in total,  <dig>  contigs were assembled by a two-step approach. first,  <dig>  contigs were mapped to their zebra finch  orthologues . this implies that we retrieved the majority of functional genes for p. w. bulomachus from a mix of transcriptomes of the cerebrum and liver. an additional  <dig>  contigs were mapped to their chicken  orthologues. a further  <dig>  contigs were assembled de novo .


 <dig> contigs filtered with coverage of >  <dig> x.

 <dig> contigs filtered with similarity  and alignment length  with their best matches used to analyze the top-hit species distribution.

after filtering out contigs with an average base coverage  of < 10x, we retained  <dig>   unique contigs for subsequent analyses, including  <dig>  and  <dig> contigs from the zebra finch and chicken mrna reference-guided assemblies respectively and  <dig>  contigs from de novo assembly . distributions of length and base coverage for the retained contigs are shown in figure  <dig>  in general, contigs assembled under guidance of the zebra finch rna sequences tended to be longer than  <dig>  bp , whereas contigs under chicken rna guidance and de novo assembly tended to be shorter  . the large number of contigs produced by de novo assembly indicates that there might be some novel genes in the p. w. bulomachus genome. the longest contigs in the zebra finch and chicken mrna reference-guided assemblies were  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp long, respectively, and that for de novo assembly was  <dig>  bp long. we divided the lengths of the contigs in the reference-guided assemblies by the lengths of their mapped references, and found most to have a ratio of >  <dig>  . only  <dig> contigs had a ratio of <  <dig>   . this implies that the deep sequencing power of rna-seq had efficiently recovered full-length or nearly full-length transcripts. the base coverage of contigs from different assemblies was generally within a range of 10 ~ 100x . however, contigs with high base coverage of > 100x) occurred more than twice as frequently in the zebra finch mrna-guided assembly  than in the chicken mrna-guided assembly  and de novo assembly .


because of similarities of the genomic structure and chromosomal organization among different species of birds  <cit> , we assumed the genome size of p. w. bulomachus to be similar to that of the zebra finch at approximately  <dig>  gbp  <cit> . the unique contigs retained in this study covered  <dig> , <dig> bp and represented approximately  <dig> % of the p. w. bulomachus genome. the reported rna sequences  of the zebra finch and chicken respectively represent approximately  <dig> % and  <dig> % of their total genomes according to the ncbi database.

blast, top-hit species distribution and go annotation
all contigs retained after filtering for base coverage  were blasted against the ncbi non-redundant  protein database using blast2go  <cit> . accessions of blast hits were then used to retrieve associated sequence descriptions and go terms.

in total,  <dig>  contigs  were returned with at least one hit with an e-value of <  <dig> e− <dig>  over half of these contigs  had a strong homology with their best hit  . about 64% of the contigs  had a mean similarity with their hits of > 80%, while only 12% of the contigs  had a mean similarity with their hits of < 60% . higher proportions of longer contigs gained ncbi nr blast matches than shorter contigs:  <dig>  or 69% of the  <dig>  contigs of >  <dig>  bp were matched against the ncbi nr database, while the proportions of matches fell to levels of  <dig> % ~ 61% in the other length categories .


to reduce low-quality blast matches, we filtered out those with sequence similarities of < 90% and alignment lengths smaller than  <dig> amino acid residues to retain a total of  <dig>  contigs . the top-hit species distribution of these filtered contigs is summarized in table  <dig>  the filtered species list may better reveal the interspecific transcript homology than an unfiltered one because only the best matches with high sequence similarities and long alignment lengths are retained. this is important since, without filtering, similarity introduced merely by sharing short but highly conserved functional domain between sequences of different species can be mistaken for genealogical homology. the vast majority of top matches of filtered p. w. bulomachus transcripts were with sequences from avian species . of those species, matches with the zebra finch  and chicken  were most frequent. top-hit species other than birds were mostly vertebrates including  <dig> mammals , five reptiles , two amphibians , and four fish . one contig was found to have its top hit to a butterfly species. another  <dig> contigs  had their best matches to the parasitic protozoan, trichomonas vaginalis, a causative agent of human trichomoniasis. we also found that  <dig> contigs had their best matches to sequences of four plant species including three crops  and one grape species. since we had a set of relatively stringent criteria to filter out the most unspecific species hits, these matches might reflect a similarity to some longer but conserved protein functional domains. however, it is also possible that they might be due to some aerosol contamination of pollen from unknown plants or contamination from food.

among all contigs with nr blastx hits,  <dig>   were associated with at least one go term . annotated sequences with a length of >  <dig> bp  were deposited in ncbi under accession nos. jr863647 ~ jr <dig>  in total,  <dig>  go terms were mapped, with a mean of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   per contig. the distribution of go terms mapped per contig is shown in figure 5a. we used go-slim to report a simpler functional schema of the p. w. bulomachus transcriptome. in total,  <dig> go-slim terms  were assigned, which included biological process , molecular function  and cellular component . the distribution of assignment counts of second-level go terms within the three major categories is summarized in figure 5b. of the six second-level go terms grouped under ‘biological processes’, those assigned to the largest numbers of contigs were regulation of biological process . of the  <dig> second-level go terms grouped under ‘molecular function’, ‘binding’  was the most common term assigned to the contigs. in ‘cellular components’ , most contigs were assigned to ‘cell parts’ .


identification of snps and ssrs
polymorphic genetic markers are important tools for detecting population structure, following an organism's demographic history, and answering various important questions in ecology and evolution  <cit> . herein, we demonstrated that the development of various genetic marker systems can be facilitated by the deep sequencing power of rna-seq. in this study,  <dig>  snps were identified from the transcriptome of p. w. bulomachus  by the snp detection algorithm implemented in the clc genomics workbench . to validate these results, we used the genome analysis toolkit  to independently detect snps. the gatk detected fewer snps  in the zebra finch reference-guided assembly than in the clc genomics workbench . this might have resulted from the more stringent setting in the gatk, as a result of which only variants with phred scores of >  <dig>  were reported as snps. in total, the two results contained  <dig>  overlapping sites in  <dig>  contigs with a mean snp density of  <dig>  snp per thousand base pairs . these snps represent promising snps for further study. overlapping snps which have at least  <dig> bp long of 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences , were deposited in the ncbi dbsnp. they will be publicly available when dbsnp build b <dig> are released . in these snp-containing contigs, we found one contig with an extraordinarily high snp density of  <dig>  snps/kbp. this contig mapped to the ring finger protein  <dig> . assuming it is a single-copy gene in the p. webbianus genome, the high variation of the heterozygous genotype indicated that its two haplotypes must have highly diverged and possibly suggests that high balancing selection has acted on it. validation rates of putative snps were reported to be more than twice as high for those expressed as heterozygotes in a single individual than for those expressed as different homozygous alleles in multiple individuals  <cit> . screening heterozygous snp sites of a single individual may, therefore, be a more-efficient way to identify valid snps. however, some of the snps detected could indeed have been of duplicated genes that share high identity  <cit> .


using msatcommader  <cit> , we found  <dig>  di-, tri-, or tetra-nucleotide ssr regions with a minimum of seven continuous repeats in all contigs . di-nucleotide repeats were the most abundant ssrs  in the p. w. bulomachus transcriptome while tri- and tetra-nucleotide repeats were only present at smaller frequencies . these ssrs could provide a rich source for further development of a polymorphic marker system for all p. webbianus populations.

discovering candidate genes for hypoxic and climatic adaptations in the transcriptome of p. w. bulomachus
in order to understand how the genetic context of p. w. bulomachus populations might have adapted to harsher highland environments, we matched our annotated contigs with  <dig> candidate genes for high-elevation  <cit>  and climatic adaptations  <cit> . we found  <dig> matches:  <dig> for hypoxia, six for climatic adaptation and two for both hypoxia and climatic adaptations . among the  <dig> hypoxia-related candidate genes, we found five genes  that are associated with the hypoxia-inducible factor  pathway and which were suggested to be under recent positive selection for human high-elevation adaptation  <cit> . we also identified eight genes  that may be correlated with thermal adaptation in humans  <cit> . an additional  <dig> genes  that may underpin environmental adaptation were found by searching go terms of oxygen binding, response to hypoxia, response to cold and response to heat from the p. w. bulomachus transcriptome database. in total, we identified  <dig> genes that can serve as a priori candidates to investigate how populations of p. w. bulomachus have adapted to diverse ecological environments along an elevational gradient.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, transcriptome information was obtained from a single individual of the taiwan endemic subspecies of p. webbianus. the vinous-throated parrotbill, which occupies broad elevational and latitudinal ranges in east asia, is an excellent organism to interpret adaptation to diverse environments. the various potential genetic markers obtained can be directly applied to understand how genetic contents can change and diversify under heterogeneous elevational environments in p. w. bulomachus, and they can also be applied to understand how the genetic structure may respond to the wide range of latitudes in which p. webbianus is found. the causal effect of natural selection on genetic aspects of ecological adaptation can be judged and compared from both vertical and horizontal environmental dimensions in a single species and may provide insights into adaptive evolution in natural populations. this is the first study providing transcriptomic information for species in the species-rich avian superfamily, the sylvioidea  <cit> . therefore, the genomic resources of p. w. bulomachus can be used for various ecological and evolutionary studies across different parrotbill species   <cit> , and can also be extended to the sylvioidea that comprises more than  <dig>  avian species in the world and is the most species-rich avian superfamily in asia  <cit> .
