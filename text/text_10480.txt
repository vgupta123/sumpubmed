BACKGROUND
during oocyte development, inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase  signaling causes arrest at meiotic prophase i. subsequent maturation, which results in breakdown of the germinal vesicle  and assembly of the meiotic spindle, requires relief of mapk inhibition. in caenorhabditis elegans, this relief is provided by major sperm protein , budded off from sperm stored in the spermatheca  <cit> . msp displaces ephrin bound to oocyte vab- <dig> receptors, resulting in mapk activation and oocyte maturation. msp also binds non-vab receptors on oocyte and gonadal sheath cell membranes, inducing ovulation of the mature oocyte into the spermatheca, the site of fertilization. fertilization activates the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome , triggering progression past anaphase i  <cit> . concomitantly, fertilization signals the rapid assembly of a chitinous eggshell that surrounds the developing embryo until hatching.

the nematode eggshell can have up to five layers, although in most species, including c. elegans, it is a trilamellate structure, comprised of an outer vitelline layer, a middle chitin-containing layer and an inner lipid-rich layer  <cit> . detailed ultrastructural studies of the c. elegans eggshell are lacking. however, electron micrographic studies of ascaris lumbricoides  <cit>  revealed that shortly after sperm penetration, the outer plasma membrane-like layer separates from the egg cytoplasm, resulting in a dense outer vitelline layer. underlying the vitelline layer is a structureless zone that subsequently becomes filled with chitin and protein, resulting in the formation of the mechanically resistant middle layer of the shell. specific proteins in this middle layer have not been identified, but proteins with chitin-binding domains are likely candidates. in c. elegans, these include t10e <dig> , f23f <dig> , m03e <dig> , r02f <dig> , k04h <dig> a, c39d <dig> , w03f <dig> , w02a <dig> , h02i <dig> , b <dig>  and cej- <dig>  proteins predicted to have peritrophin-a domains, a conserved chitin-binding domain found in peritrophic matrix proteins of insects and in animal chitinases  <cit> . two of these proteins, cej- <dig> and b <dig> , have recently been shown to bind chitin and to be modified by chondroitin addition  <cit> . moreover, chondroitin deficiency in squashed vulva  mutants results in embryos in which the space between the eggshell and the embryo is missing, and in which cytokinesis at the one-cell stage is defective  <cit> . these results suggest that cej- <dig> and b <dig>  are likely to play an important role as components of the eggshell.

coincident with the deposition of chitin and protein into the middle layer of the shell, the inner proteolipid layer of the eggshell  is formed by extrusion of embryonic cytoplasmic refringent granules, and the first polar body is extruded into this layer. by the time of pseudocleavage in the one-cell embryo, the trilamellate eggshell is separated from the embryo plasma membrane by a clear zone, which may be the precursor of the perivitelline fluid  that surrounds later stage embryos. in 3-day-old ascaris suum embryos, the pvf has been shown to contain a number of proteins, including the fatty acid-binding protein, as-p <dig>  which has been suggested to play a role in maintaining the barrier function of the inner eggshell layer  <cit> .

chitin n]) is polymerized from the sugar nucleotide donor, uridine diphosphate-n-acetylglucosamine , synthesized by the hexosamine pathway   <cit> . eggshell chitin production places a sudden and high demand on this pathway, with as much as 50% of embryonic glycogen proposed to be required for udp-glcnac synthesis in ascaris megalocephala  <cit> . the c. elegans eggshell can be removed at the two-cell stage, without interrrupting development, at least until gastrulation  <cit> . this has led to the suggestion that the function of the chitinous eggshell is restricted to mechanical support of the developing embryo from gastrulation onwards. however, an earlier embryonic lethal phenotype results from rna interference , with enzymes catalyzing any one of the five hexosamine pathway steps leading to chitin synthesis   <cit> . furthermore, transcripts for two key enzymes in this pathway, glucosamine-6-phosphate n-acetyltransferase - <dig> and glutamine synthetase - <dig>  are tightly regulated by the germline translational repressor, gld- <dig>   <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that the chitinous eggshell is developmentally essential before the two-cell stage.

many of the developmental events that follow fertilization require asymmetric or focal actomyosin contraction, which may depend on eggshell assembly. for example, polar-body cytokinesis is highly asymmetric and depends on non-muscle myosin - <dig> enriched at the contractile ring  <cit> . polar-body extrusion also requires the actin/myosin cross-linking protein, ani- <dig>  the myosin light chain homologue, mlc- <dig>  and the microfilament organizing proteins, profilin - <dig> and cyk - <dig>  <cit> . following polar-body extrusion, the embryonic cortex undergoes a period of membrane ruffling that is dependent on focal enrichment of the actomyosin cytoskeleton at the base of the ruffles  <cit> . ruffling requires ani- <dig>  nmy- <dig>  pfn- <dig> and cyk- <dig>  and is coincident with cytoplasmic flow and the movement of the sperm pronucleus/centrosome complex  towards the cortex  <cit> . spcc-cortical association marks the posterior of the embryo  <cit> , and is associated with the initiation of anterior-posterior  polarization, which culminates in an asymmetric first cell division, generating two daughter cells  with distinct developmental potentials  <cit> . coincident with spcc-cortical association is the local clearing of nmy- <dig> foci and local relaxation of actomyosin contraction. the resultant non-contractile cortex expands anteriorly to the approximate halfway point, terminating in the pseudocleavage furrow, which demarcates the smooth par -2/par-1-binding posterior cortex from the contractile par-3/par-6/pkc-3-binding anterior cortex  <cit> . this highly asymmetric contraction and p-a cortical flow is associated with an opposing a-p cytoplasmic flow, which transports cytoplasmic determinants, including p granules, to the posterior  <cit> .

cortical and cytoplasmic flows at polarization are dependent on par- <dig> , par- <dig> , par- <dig> , par- <dig> , and mex- <dig> and mex- <dig>  two related cytoplasmic zinc-finger proteins  <cit> . par- <dig>  appears dispensable for flows, but is required later to negatively regulate the activity and stability of mex-5/mex- <dig>  and to restrict p granules and pie- <dig> to the posterior  <cit> . par- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> are asymmetrically distributed, and par-3/par- <dig> polarization requires cdc- <dig>  a member of the rho family of guanosine triphosphatases  that, in mammalian axons, causes actin reorganization and elongation  <cit> . in addition to polarizing the cortex and the cytoplasm, c. elegans pars are required for the unequal pulling forces on the anterior and posterior mitotic spindle poles that result in an asymmetric first cell division  <cit> . polarization and asymmetric division also require the dyrk-related minibrain kinase- <dig> . mbk- <dig> stimulates the cul-3/mel- <dig> e <dig> ubiquitin ligase-dependent destruction of mei- <dig> and mei- <dig>  two katanin-related microtubule-severing proteins. mei- <dig> and mei- <dig> maintain the smaller meiotic spindle, and their destruction is required to permit polymerization of the larger mitotic spindle  <cit> . mbk- <dig> also targets the oocyte maturation factor, oma- <dig>  for cul-2/zyg- <dig> e <dig> ubiquitin ligase-dependent destruction. this relieves the oma- <dig> block to cul-2/zif- <dig> e <dig> ubiquitin ligase-dependent destruction of pie- <dig>  which contributes to the destruction of pie- <dig> in the anterior of the embryo  <cit> .

progression past meiosis metaphase i requires activation of the apc/c. complete loss of function of genes encoding apc subunits results in mat  embryos with either no polarization or reversed polarization  <cit> . partial loss of function of apc can support the completion of meiosis, but results in embryos with combined polarity and osmotic-sensitivity defects   <cit> . the pod class is diverse, including not only apc subunit genes, but also genes encoding a coronin-like actin-binding protein , two genes encoding enzymes required for fatty-acid biosynthesis  and a gene encoding the rho family gtpase, cdc- <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we identify gna- <dig> as a novel pod mutant, and demonstrate that eggshell chitin and two functionally redundant chitin-binding proteins, cej- <dig> and b <dig> , are essential for error-free segregation at meiosis, for extrusion of the polar bodies and for spcc association with the cortex. these results form the basis of a model of c. elegans embryonic development that includes an essential role for the eggshell in actomyosin-dependent events at the one-cell stage.

RESULTS
gna- <dig> is udp-glcnac-deficient, and genetic rescue results in a him phenotype
the c. elegans genome has two gna homologues, gna- <dig> and gna- <dig>  rnai with gna- <dig> results in a wild-type phenotype, while rnai with gna- <dig> is embryonic lethal (). to explore the role of gna- <dig> in c. elegans development, we isolated , an allele lacking the entire coding sequence .

gna- <dig> males are fertile, and hermaphrodites are viable but 100% penetrant for the maternal effect embryonic lethal  phenotype. an extrachromosomal array containing the coding sequence for gna- <dig>  partially rescued the gna- <dig> embryonic lethal phenotype and resulted in a high incidence of males  phenotype. hatchling numbers/hermaphrodite, % him and number  of hermaphrodites assayed were as follows.  wild type with no extrachromosomal array:  <dig> hatchlings,  <dig> % him, n = 10;  wild type carrying an extrachromosomal array of the visible rol <dig> marker, prf4:  <dig> hatchlings,  <dig> % him, n = 10; and  two independent lines of gna- <dig> carrying the visible rol <dig> marker, prf <dig>  and also carrying an extrachromosomal array bearing a translational fusion of gna-2::gfp . in adult gna- <dig> hermaphrodites, udp-glcnac was undetectable , and its epimer, udp-galnac, was decreased to 19% of wild-type levels . three alleles  of a single suppressor  of gna- <dig> were identified, and sup- <dig> required gna- <dig> for suppression of lethality, suggesting that udp-glcnac synthesis is essential for embryonic development . furthermore, the gna- <dig> mel phenotype was partially rescued by injection of 50– <dig> mm udp-glcnac into the distal germline . these results demonstrate that the mel phenotype of gna- <dig> results from loss of gna- <dig> catalytic activity, which causes udp-glcnac deficiency in the germline or early embryo. thus, de novo synthesis of udp-glcnac is essential for early development in c. elegans. the udp-glcnac end product, chitin, was markedly reduced in embryos dissected from gna- <dig> hermaphrodites  embryos) , as was reactivity with the lectins wga, lea, sta and sba . in wild-type embryos, wga staining revealed transient cortical-membrane punctae that appeared by the first meiotic division and disappeared by the two-cell stage . lea, sta, sba and cbd-f staining were not punctate, indicating that wga reactivity in wild-type embryos reveals a non-chitin glycoconjugate . wga binds with high affinity to α2–3-linked sialic acids in mammalian cells. however, these structures are absent in c. elegans, and natsuka et al  <cit>  have shown that wga binding in c. elegans most likely reflects α-galnac modification of mucin-type glycoproteins.

meiosis and polar-body extrusion are defective in gna-2
live in utero recordings of gna- <dig> embryos expressing tubulin::gfp showed meiotic spindles that wax and wane with normal timing . meiosis i+ii was almost identical for wild type  and gna- <dig> . furthermore, the time during which a meiosis ii spindle could be visualized in wild type  and gna- <dig>   is consistent with the timing for wild type reported by liu et al <cit> , , but very different from the timing for cul- <dig> , which has a perdurant meiosis ii spindle.

as an independent measure of meiotic timing, we examined embryos expressing histone h2b::gfp . results for wild-type meiotic timing  were similar to those previously reported for wild type   <cit> . furthermore, gna- <dig> had meiosis i and meiosis ii timings similar to wild type. this is very different from results reported for cul- <dig> or zyg- <dig>  in which meiosis i timing was normal, but meiosis ii time was extended   <cit> . combined with the tubulin::gfp results, the histone h2b::gfp results support the conclusion that gna- <dig> does not have a perdurant meiosis ii spindle. using the histone h2b::gfp, we detected stray chromatin  in 8% of gna- <dig> embryos at anaphase i, and 15% of gna- <dig> embryos at anaphase ii, suggesting chromosome nondisjunction . additionally, a polar body was not extruded following anaphase i, and all maternal dna entered meiosis ii, resulting in  <dig> sister chromatid pairs at prophase ii , rather than the normal number of  <dig> . a second polar body formed after anaphase ii, but was not extruded . whereas polar-body extrusion was defective, maternal and paternal pronuclei decondensed and met with normal timing . the unextruded second polar body  often migrated to meet the pronuclei, although its migration usually lagged behind that of the maternal pronucleus.

live in utero recording also showed that the spcc failed to associate closely with the cortex in gna- <dig>  . in wild-type embryos, spcc-cortical association correlates with the initiation of polarization, which results in the anterior spread of a par- <dig> -binding smooth posterior cortex that culminates in the pseudocleavage furrow. in addition to showing failed spcc-cortical association, a pseudocleavage furrow was never observed in gna- <dig> . furthermore, cortical polarity was defective in gna- <dig> embryos, as indicated by a failure to segregate par- <dig> to the anterior cortex , and cortical par- <dig> was reduced and mislocalized following gna- <dig> depletion by gna- <dig> rnai . cytoplasmic polarity was also defective, as posterior localization of p granules was not observed and pie- <dig> was undetectable .

a par-2::gfp was examined in single-cell embryos in which  <dig> discrete hoechst-staining structures were in close proximity to one another in the cytoplasm. gna- <dig>  chs- <dig> and cej-1+b <dig>  fail to extrude the 2nd polar body; therefore, a 3rd hoechst-staining structure could often be discerned. numbers are % of embryos displaying phenotype

differential interference contrast  imaging  revealed that gna- <dig> embryos had some form of eggshell ; however, the shell was deficient in chitin and other lectin-reactive glycoconjugates  and did not maintain a rigid oval shape in the uterus. gna- <dig> embryos were also osmotically sensitive, swelling in h2o and shrinking in  <dig> mm kcl, and were permeable to the lipophilic dye, fm 4– <dig>  consistent with an osmotic/permeability barrier defect . together with the polarity defects, this identifies gna- <dig> as a novel pod mutant. it is possible that polarization defects in pod mutants might be secondary to osmotic defects, as has been shown for the cytokinesis defect of cyk- <dig> mutants  <cit> . as such, the chitinous eggshell may be essential to provide an osmotically appropriate environment for a-p polarization. to determine if gna-2-deficient embryos could polarize if provided with synthetic osmotic support, worms expressing par-2::gfp were subjected to gna- <dig> rnai, and embryos were dissected and incubated in minimal embryonic growth medium   <cit> . egm provided little rescue of polarization , suggesting that polarization defects in gna-2-deficient embryos may be dissociable from osmotic sensitivity. however, it is also possible that egm did not provide adequate and/or timely osmotic support.

rnai with chitin synthase- <dig> phenocopies gna-2
the c. elegans genome encodes two chitin synthase  homologues. chs- <dig> is expressed in the pharynx and head neurons of larvae and adults, and chs- <dig> is expressed in the hermaphrodite germline, in eggs and in dauer larvae  <cit> . consistent with its expression during early development, chs- <dig> rnai blocked eggshell chitin production and resulted in a highly penetrant embryonic lethality that resembled gna- <dig> . embryos were fragile, osmotically sensitive and fm 4–64-permeable . meiotic timing was normal , but embryos failed to extrude the polar bodies and had  <dig> sister chromatid pairs at meiosis ii . furthermore, stray chromatin detected at anaphase ii  suggested meiotic chromosome segregation defects . additionally, the spcc failed to associate closely with the cortex  and a pseudocleavage furrow was not detected  . par- <dig> and p granules were mislocalized and pie- <dig> was undetectable , showing that polarization was defective. moreover, par-2::gfp was undetectable or mislocalized, and incubation in minimal egm did not rescue localization . the nearly identical phenotypes of gna- <dig> and chs- <dig> support the conclusion that chitin deficiency is responsible for the gna- <dig> mel phenotype. the pod phenotype of hypomorphic alleles of genes encoding apc subunits might suggest that apc activity is required for chitin synthesis. however, while mat- <dig> embryos at the non-permissive temperature  were arrested at meiotic metaphase i, they still produced a chitinous eggshell, showing that chitin synthesis does not depend on apc activity . this result also indicates that the pod phenotype of hypomorphic apc alleles does not result from chitin deficiency.

cej-1+b <dig>  phenocopies gna- <dig> and chs-1
cej- <dig> and b <dig>  encode proteins predicted to be secreted mucins with multiple chitin-binding peritrophin-a domains . furthermore, cej- <dig> and b <dig>  are targets of the germline translational repressor gld- <dig>  and combined cej- <dig> and b <dig>  rnai ) has an embryonic lethal phenotype that resembles gna- <dig>  <cit>  . these results suggested that cej- <dig> and b <dig>  might be required for eggshell assembly or function. cej-1+b <dig>  did not prevent eggshell chitin deposition , and meiotic timing was normal . however, embryos had stray chromatin at anaphase i  and anaphase ii , failed to extrude the polar bodies , and had  <dig> sister chromatid pairs at meiosis ii  . moreover, spcc-cortical association failed , and a pseudocleavage furrow was not detected  . additionally, par- <dig> and p granules were mislocalized, pie- <dig> was undetectable, par-2::gfp was undetectable or mislocalized, and par-2::gfp localization defects were not rescued by incubation in minimal egm . furthermore, like gna- <dig> or chs- <dig>  cej-1+b <dig>  resulted in embryos that were osmotically sensitive and fm 4–64-permeable . these findings support a model in which gna- <dig> is required for chs-1-dependent synthesis of eggshell chitin, which binds cej- <dig> and b <dig> , proteins with essential but overlapping roles in meiotic chromosome segregation, polar-body extrusion, osmotic barrier function and polarization.

mbk- <dig> localization requires chs- <dig>  but not cej-1/b <dig> 
the dyrk-related kinase, mbk- <dig>  is required for polarization and asymmetric division. furthermore, like wga-g , it is cortically localized in oocytes in the proximal germline, and in the embryo its cortical distribution changes from uniform to dramatically punctate during meiosis  <cit> . to determine if mbk- <dig> and wga-g colocalize, hermaphrodites expressing mbk-2::gfp were dissected, and germline and embryos were costained with a gfp antibody and wga conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine-5--isothiocyanate . wga-g and mbk- <dig> colocalized in the cortex of oocytes in the proximal germline and in the cortex of newly fertilized embryos . furthermore, cortical wga-g and mbk- <dig> punctae were completely coincident at anaphase of meiosis i . mbk- <dig> localizes to centrosomes and chromosomes  <cit>  by first mitosis, at which point, wga-g punctae are no longer detected.

wga-g and mbk- <dig> colocalize in the germline, and wga-g was intact in mbk- <dig> , a putative null allele, suggesting that wga-g could be required upstream of mbk- <dig> localization. in that case, disruption of embryonic wga-g by chs- <dig> rnai might also prevent mbk- <dig> localization. hermaphrodites expressing mbk-2::gfp were subjected to chs- <dig> rnai, and germline and embryos were costained with a gfp antibody and wga-tritc. cortical mbk- <dig> was undetectable in oocytes and in embryos following chs- <dig> rnai . in contrast, neither mbk- <dig> nor wga-g was mislocalized following cej-1+b <dig>  . chitin was not detected in oocytes in the germline, using the highly specific chitin-binding probe, cbd-f , but chs- <dig> rnai disrupted oocyte localization of mbk- <dig>  the simplest explanation for these findings is that chs- <dig> rna or chs- <dig>  rather than chitin itself, is required for mbk- <dig> localization. in this regard, chitin synthases  <cit>  and the homologous vertebrate hyaluronan synthases  <cit> , are unusual in their localization to the plasma membrane, rather than the endoplamic reticulum/golgi apparatus. saccharomyces cerevesiae chitin synthase-iii is found in membranous organelles called chitosomes, and chitin synthase activation probably requires both enzyme phosphorylation and transport of chitosomes to the plasma membrane  <cit> . therefore, one possibility is that mbk- <dig> may be localized to the oocyte cortex by virtue of its association with a chs-1-containing compartment. alternatively, chitin may be present in oocytes in the germline at a level that was too low to detect, or in a form that was masked by binding to a germline-expressed chitin-binding protein.

chs- <dig> rnai disrupts mbk- <dig> localization, including the cortical patches that presage mbk-2-dependent apc degradation of mei- <dig> and mei- <dig>  furthermore, chs- <dig> and mbk- <dig> both fail to localize p granules  <cit> , suggesting that mbk- <dig> deficiency might contribute to the chs- <dig> phenotype. however, failed spcc-cortical association in chs- <dig> may be sufficient to explain p-granule mislocalization. furthermore, cej-1+b <dig>  embryos mislocalize p granules, but mbk- <dig> localization is preserved. taken together, these results suggest that mbk- <dig> mislocalization is not responsible for p-granule mislocalization in chs- <dig>  similarly, while chs- <dig> and mbk- <dig> both exhibit a multinucleated phenotype, cej-1+b <dig>  shares this phenotype; therefore, it is probably not attributable to mbk- <dig> mislocalization. the apparent insignificance of disruption of mbk- <dig> in chs- <dig> may reflect the earlier and/or more severe developmental defects in chs- <dig> 

discussion
the eggshell is required for actin-dependent events at meiosis
treatment of c. elegans embryos with latrunculin a, a drug that inhibits actin polymerization by sequestering g-actin, prevents polar-body extrusion and results in a phenotype of  <dig> sister chromatids at meiotic metaphase ii  <cit> . embryos deficient in pfn- <dig>  an actin-binding protein, have a similar phenotype  <cit> . here we demonstrate that in spite of normal meiotic timing, gna- <dig>  chs- <dig> or cej-1+b <dig>  embryos have a latrunculin a-like meiotic phenotype, with failed polar-body extrusion, and  <dig> sister chromatid pairs at meiosis ii. therefore, a critical role of the eggshell in meiosis appears to be support of actin-dependent polar-body extrusion.

c. elegans males arise at a frequency of about  <dig> %, by non-disjunction of the x chromosome, and a phenotype showing a high incidence of males  is a common finding in mutants with meiotic chromosome-segregation defects  <cit> . gna- <dig> rescued by extrachromosomal array was him, and stray chromatin was detected at meiosis i and meiosis ii, in some gna- <dig> embryos. furthermore, chs- <dig> or cej-1+b <dig>  embryos also had stray chromatin at meiosis. these findings indicate that the eggshell is required for faithful meiotic chromosome segregation. meiotic spindles localized to the embryonic cortex in gna- <dig>  chs- <dig> or cej-1+b <dig>  embryos and meiosis occurred with normal timing, suggesting that gross meiotic spindle defects did not underlie the chromosome-segregation defects. however, it is possible that more subtle defects in spindle microtubule structure could explain the lagging chromosome phenotype. in starfish, and perhaps also in xenopus and mouse  <cit> , actin is essential for chromosome capture by the spindle during chromosome segregation. therefore, the chromosome segregation defects identified in this study may also reflect a requirement for the eggshell in supporting actin-dependent chromosome capture.

fm 4– <dig> dye permeability is a reliable indicator of osmotic sensitivity in pod mutants, and in wild-type embryos treated with a laser pulse to perforate the eggshell  <cit> . in wild-type embryos, the first polar body stained with fm 4– <dig>  demonstrating that it is external to the barrier. therefore, meiosis i and extrusion of the first polar body precede development of the osmotic/permeability barrier. accordingly, the defects in meiosis i segregation and first polar-body extrusion in gna- <dig>  chs- <dig> and cej-1+b <dig>  are not likely to be secondary to osmotic defects. cej- <dig> and b <dig>  bind chitin  <cit> ; furthermore, they are substituted with chondroitin chains and are predicted to be mucins, which are highly hydrophilic and hydrating glycoproteins  <cit> . chondroitin proteoglycans are required in the c. elegans hermaphrodite to prevent collapse of the developing vulva  <cit> . furthermore, they are essential for polar-body extrusion and for the separation of the embryonic plasma membrane from the eggshell  <cit> . therefore, analogous to the role of chondroitin-proteoglycans in the developing vulva, cej-1/b <dig>  may support actomyosin-mediated cytokinesis of polar bodies by generating a hydrated matrix.

the eggshell is required for polarization, an actomyosin-dependent process
spcc-cortical association failed in gna- <dig>  chs- <dig> and cej-1+b <dig> , and pseudocleavage furrow formation was not detected. furthermore, in fixed embryos, cortical par- <dig> was not asymmetric, cortical par- <dig> was reduced and mislocalized, cytoplasmic p granules were not confined to the posterior, and cytoplasmic pie- <dig> was undetectable. a perdurant meiotic spindle has been proposed as a possible explanation for reversal of polarization in cul- <dig>  <cit> . however, in this study, we determined that meiotic spindle duration and meiotic timing were normal; therefore, the polarization defects associated with deficiency of eggshell chitin or cej-1/b <dig>  cannot be a consequence of an extended meiosis ii and/or a perdurant meiosis ii spindle.

the importance of actomyosin contraction in polarization is underscored by the previous observation that loss of function of actin-associated proteins, such as pod- <dig>  nmy- <dig>  mlc- <dig> or pfn- <dig>  prevents both cytoplasmic flow and polarization  <cit> . our results demonstrate that actomyosin-dependent polarization also requires eggshell chitin and cej-1/b <dig> . while most gna- <dig>  chs- <dig> and cej-1+b <dig>  embryos showed failed spcc-cortical association, in a few embryos the spcc appeared to associate closely with the cortex, but pseudocleavage was not seen. these results suggest that in addition to being required for spcc movement to or association with the cortex, the eggshell may also be required subsequently for the anterior-directed cortical-domain movement that follows spcc-cortical association.

pod mutants and the osmotic barrier
par mutants are polarity-defective, but osmotically insensitive. therefore, polarization is not required for development of the osmotic barrier. in contrast, polarity is usually defective in osmotically sensitive mutants, and the pod phenotype results from deficiency of a diverse group of proteins, including pod- <dig> , apc subunits , enzymes required for fatty-acid synthesis   <cit> , a ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase required for actin-dependent processes   <cit>  and proteins required for eggshell synthesis  . these results indicate that polarization may require an osmotically appropriate environment, and that pod-class polarity defects could be secondary to osmotic sensitivity. the results of our study, and those of rappleye et al <cit>  for emb- <dig>  emb- <dig>  pod- <dig> or fatty-acid synthase , showing that polarization was not rescued by incubation in isotonic medium, suggest that in some pod mutants polarity defects may not simply be a consequence of osmotic defects. intriguingly, rappleye et al <cit>  also determined that pod- <dig> supplemented with long-chain fatty acids  were normally polarized when dissected in isotonic medium. unfortunately, however, in that study it was not reported whether polarity was defective in embryos dissected in non-isotonic medium, probably reflecting the fact that osmotically sensitive embryos often burst  without osmotic support. therefore, while the results showed that a combination of lipid supplementation and osmotic support rescued polarization in pod- <dig>  it is not clear whether the rescue was provided by the lipids or by the isotonic medium. additionally, the osmotically sensitive mutants emb- <dig> and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a  reductase  were normally polarized when dissected in isotonic medium but no data were presented for embryos dissected in non-isotonic medium. as such, the question of whether or not polarization defects of pod mutants are secondary to osmotic sensitivity remains unresolved.

as has been suggested for the ascaroside layer in ascaris species  <cit> , a role of the osmotic barrier in the c. elegans embryo may be to prevent desiccation after the egg is laid. the molecule responsible for this barrier has not been identified. it may include lipid molecules of the inner eggshell layer playing a role analogous to that of ascarosides. however, em images of pod- <dig> showed that all three eggshell layers appeared intact, but embryos were osmotically sensitive and dye-permeable  <cit> . therefore, it seems likely that the c. elegans permeability barrier resides inside the inner eggshell layer, as suggested by our results showing that the first polar body  stains with fm 4– <dig>  while the second does not. a deficiency of hmg-coa reductase causes osmotic sensitivity, suggesting that the c. elegans osmotic barrier requires cholesterol  <cit> . furthermore, as long-chain fatty acids  were insufficient to rescue the osmotic sensitivity of pod- <dig>  <cit> , the barrier may require shorter-chain fatty acids or other malonyl coa-derived molecules. in this study, we determined that chs- <dig> or cej-1+b <dig>  embryos have defects in the osmotic/permeability barrier. these results suggest that the chitinous middle layer of the eggshell is required for synthesis/extrusion of the inner eggshell layer, which could be the osmotic barrier itself, or is required for subsequent synthesis/extrusion of molecule comprising the osmotic barrier.

the eggshell may provide a "skeleton" to support actomyosin contraction in the one-cell embryo
the eggshell is required for multiple early developmental events, including meiosis, polar-body extrusion, osmotic barrier function and polarization. however, while the eggshell is physically associated with the embryonic plasma membrane at meiosis i, by polarization, additional layers separate the chitinous eggshell from the embryonic plasma membrane. this indicates that the embryonic plasma membrane is in contact with different extracellular molecules at different stages in the development of the one-cell embryo, which may suggest that the eggshell serves distinct functions at different stages. for example, during meiosis i, when it is closely associated with the plasma membrane, the eggshell might act as a physical scaffold for cortical molecules overlying the meiotic spindle. subsequently, during polar-body extrusion, the eggshell might provide a fluid space into which the polar bodies can be extruded. additionally, from second polar-body extrusion onwards, the eggshell could be required primarily to provide an osmotic barrier. moreover, as long-chain fatty-acid supplementation suggests that membrane properties are crucial for polarization  <cit> , the eggshell might be required during polarization for integrity of the plasma membrane. while these or other distinct, separate roles could underlie the requirement for the eggshell in multiple early developmental processes, a common feature of these events may explain, at least in part, the requirement for the eggshell. specifically, as meiosis, polar-body extrusion and polarization all appear to be actomyosin-dependent, it seems likely that the eggshell supports actomyosin-dependent contractile events.

at both the cellular and the whole-animal level, some form of skeletal support usually facilitates contractile events. for example, in motile mammalian cells, dynamic adhesion to the extracellular matrix supports the pulling forces of the actomyosin network that move the cell forward  <cit> . at the whole-animal level, skeletal-muscle contraction is facilitated by a skeleton, which can be internal or external, and rigid or hydrostatic. for example, in vertebrates and "hard-shelled" arthropods, contraction requires muscle attachment to the bony skeleton or to a rigid exoskeleton, respectively. in animals that lack a rigid skeleton, a hydrostatic skeleton can provide a zone of incompressible fluid to transmit the force of muscle contraction . by way of example, coelomic fluid in annelids is propelled forward by a wave of contraction of circular and longitudinal muscles, which results in a net movement of the worm in the direction of coelomic fluid flow  <cit> . furthermore, while crustaceans normally depend on a rigid exoskeleton for body muscle contraction, a hydrostatic skeleton is used during the post-molt, soft-shell stage  <cit> . hydrostatic skeletons can also be utilized within the context of a rigid 'container'. for example, fluid in the gut of the nematode aphelenchoides acts as a hydrostatic skeleton that facilitates movement either of gut contents or of the whole animal, depending on the coordination of body-wall muscle contraction. specifically, when localized regions of dorsal and ventral body muscles contract in phase, gut contents are moved; conversely, a wave of alternating dorsal and ventral contraction results in sinusoidal locomotion of the worm.

cej- <dig> and b <dig>  bind chitin, and it is possible that they also bind, directly or indirectly, to plasma-membrane molecules that link to the actomyosin cytoskeleton. in this way, the eggshell and/or molecules in the pvf could act as a dynamic adhesive matrix to anchor focal actomyosin contraction during meiosis, polar-body extrusion and polarization, analogous to the role played by the extracellular matrix in supporting focal adhesion in migrating cells or extending axonal growth cones. conversely, or additionally, as cej- <dig> and b <dig>  are chondroitin-modified and have multiple mucin domains, their role may reflect an ability to generate a fluid-filled space. in this case, transmission of actomyosin contractile forces in the one-cell c. elegans embryo may depend on the hydrated eggshell/pvf acting as a hydrostatic skeleton. this would be analogous to the situation in jumping spiders, where it has been proposed that a hydrostatic skeleton within a rigid exoskeleton allows application of a large amount of force to a small deformation, resulting in a forceful and quick movement  <cit> . in the case of polar-body extrusion, localized asymmetric force application may facilitate cytokinesis. similarly, during the actomyosin-dependent ruffling stage that is coincident with movement of the large spcc to the cortex, fluid translocated into the ingressing ruffles  might be required to generate sufficient force to propel the spcc to the cortex.

CONCLUSIONS
methods
standard methods were followed for molecular biology and nematode culture  <cit> . unless otherwise stated, wild type refers to n <dig> worms fed op <dig> bacteria.

gna- <dig> isolation, rescue and suppressors
gna- <dig> was isolated by screening a chemical deletion library -treated n <dig>  generated in the laboratory of j. culotti) by nested pcr using the primer pairs 5'-actccgcccccaatcttgttgc-3' and 5'-aaccagcgtaccgcacagttgc-3' and 5'-ttgtcgaaggaaggggaggagc3' and 5'-aatcattgtggcggcgaggagg-3'. deletion breakpoints were established by sequencing the truncated pcr product. the gna- <dig> allele, qa <dig>  was outcrossed  <dig> times to yield strain xa <dig> /unc-109i). the gna-2-bearing chromosome was marked by recombination with unc- <dig> and balanced with gld- <dig> to produce xa <dig> /gna- <dig> unc-55i). stable transformation rescue of gna- <dig> was demonstrated with a fragment of the cosmid t23g <dig> sub-cloned into pbsks- to yield the construct pwj <dig>  pak42- <dig>  a rescuing gna-2::gfp translational fusion, was generated by inserting the gfp coding sequence of ppd <dig>   into pwj <dig> just prior to the stop codon of gna- <dig> . transgenic animals were generated by gonad injection  <cit> . rol- <dig>  was used as the visible co-injection marker, and empty pbsks- was used to bulk out the arrays. injections were conducted using a total dna concentration of  <dig> ng/μl and a plasmid ratio of 1:9: <dig> rescuing construct: pbsks-:prf <dig>  for pwj <dig>  wild-type hermaphrodites were injected, and arrays were passed into a gna- <dig> unc-55i background. for pak42- <dig>  gld-1/gna- <dig> unc- <dig> hermaphrodites were injected, and rolling uncs were selected. to confirm rescue, individual fertile, rolling unc worms were genotyped for the deletion by pcr.

to identify suppressors of gna- <dig> an f <dig> screen was performed. gld-1/gna- <dig> unc- <dig> l <dig> hermaphrodites were mutagenized using ems . f <dig> progeny were fed gna- <dig> rnai to enrich for suppressors, and unc- <dig> f3s were picked and pooled . plates were examined for fertility and lines were established from hermaphrodites throwing only unc progeny. a minimum of  <dig> haploid genomes was screened. the recovered alleles were outcrossed  <dig> times, subjected to complementation analysis, and mapped to linkage group i. qa <dig> and qa <dig> were isolated from gna- <dig> and then reconstructed with gna- <dig> by recombination, with the aid of unc- <dig> 

additional strains
the following additional strains were also constructed: xa <dig> /gna- <dig> unc55i; unc- <dig> ruis <dig> iii), xa <dig> /gna- <dig> unc55i; unc- <dig> iii; ruis <dig> ), xa <dig>  unc-55i; qaex <dig> ), xa <dig>  unc-55i; qaex <dig> ), xa <dig> i), xa <dig>  unc <dig>  sup-46i), xa <dig>  unc <dig>  sup-46i), xa <dig> i) and de <dig> . we also obtained the following cgc strains: n <dig>  cb <dig>  az <dig> ; ruis <dig> iii), az <dig>  iii; ruis <dig> , dr <dig> i), dr <dig> unc- <dig> i), ds <dig> ii), jk1466/dpy-5unc-13i), jh <dig> iii; axis <dig> ), jh1580mbk-2iv/nt <dig>  and kk <dig> .

rnai and hatchling number determination, and biochemical rescue
rnai was performed by feeding  <cit> . the following rnai feeding vectors were produced by cloning pcr-generated genomic sequence into the sma <dig> site of ppd <dig>  : pak57- <dig> , pak56- <dig> , pak55- <dig> . the gna- <dig> rnai feeding vector, pak38- <dig>  was a pcr-generated cdna fragment  cloned into the bamh <dig> and xbai sites of ppd <dig> . double-stranded rna production was induced in liquid culture, and bacteria were collected by centrifugation and spread on ngm plates supplemented with ampicillin, tetracycline and isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside . escherichia coli strain op <dig> on unsupplemented ngm was used as a control, unless otherwise stated. for combined rnai , approximately equal amounts of each bacterial preparation were mixed before spreading on the plates.

to determine hatchling number, single l1/l <dig> larvae  were transferred to individual plates and allowed to lay eggs. total hatchling number/hermaphrodite was determined by aspirating f <dig> larvae prior to adulthood. for experiments quantifying % him, the po was transferred to a new plate each day until no new hatchlings were observed, and the sex of the hatchlings on each progeny plate was determined at the l <dig> or adult stage. results were analysed by one-way analysis of variance  followed by tukey's multiple comparison test. hatchling number was determined, rather than brood size or % of brood that hatched, because brood-size measurements would have been inaccurate for the following reasons:  embryos with a defective eggshell are fragile and sometimes break as they are laid; these embryos would have be excluded from the brood count;  embryos with a defective eggshell are often laid as part of a large cohesive mass, which precludes accurate quantification of the number of embryos in the mass; and  gna- <dig> and chs- <dig> embryos are pale brown and non-refractile, making them easily confused with  oocytes.

to test biochemical rescue of the gna- <dig> mel phenotype, young adult unc- <dig> hermaphrodites were picked from gld-1/gna- <dig> unc <dig> i plates. udp-glcnac was dissolved in water  and injected into the rachis of a single gonad arm as described previously  <cit> . the number of hatchlings from each injected hermaphrodite was quantified by transferring individual hatchlings to single plates. hermaphrodites throwing any wild-type or gld- <dig> progeny were excluded from further analysis.

hplc
for hplc analysis  <dig> adult hermaphrodite wild type or gna- <dig> were collected in m <dig> buffer, washed three times in m <dig>  incubated for  <dig> min at room temperature , washed three times in h2o, resuspended in  <dig> μl h2o, frozen in dry ice/ethanol and stored at -80°c for no longer than  <dig> week. samples were thawed rapidly, sonicated for  <dig> seconds, centrifuged, and the supernatant filtered and injected onto an anion exchange column . detection was by ultraviolet absorption at  <dig> nm. udp-glcnac, udp galnac, udp-glc and udp-gal were quantified and udp-glcnac and udp-galnac were expressed as a percentage of udp-glc + udp-gal

microscopy
for fixed embryos, young adult hermaphrodites were washed in  <dig> mm kcl and transferred to  <dig> % poly-lysine-coated slides. embryos were released by cutting at the gonad, or gonads were released by cutting just behind the pharynx, followed by freeze-fracture  <cit> . slides were fixed in 4°c meoh for  <dig> min , in -20°c meoh for  <dig> min  or in -20°c meoh for  <dig> min . after fixation, slides were washed for  <dig> min in phosphate-buffered slaine , and for  <dig> min in pbs with  <dig> % tween- <dig> , and were blocked in pbs containing 10% goat serum and 1% bsa  for  <dig> min at rt. primary antibodies were diluted in pbgs and applied overnight at 4°c at the following dilutions: anti-pgl- <dig>  <cit> , 1:10000; anti-pie- <dig>  1: <dig>  <cit> ; anti-par- <dig> 1: <dig>  <cit> . par-2::gfp and mbk-2::gfp , were detected by an anti-gfp antibody . the following secondary antibodies  were used: goat anti-mouse -fluorescein isothiocyanate  ; goat anti-rabbit -rhodamine ; gar-fitc . lectins  were diluted in pbgs  and applied overnight at 4°c. the chitin-binding probe ; gift of y. zhang, new england biolabs, inc., ipswich ma) was diluted 1: <dig> in pbgs and applied overnight at 4°c. dna was stained with hoechst , then slowfade  was added prior to mounting, and fluorescence was detected on a leica leitz dmrb microscope. to test osmotic sensitivity, living embryos were dissected in h2o,  <dig> or  <dig> mm kcl, transferred to the appropriate  2% agarose pad on a glass slide, and viewed by dic. compression by the glass coverslip was prevented by depositing embryos into the fluid-filled space that was created by removing a central disc from the pad. to test whether osmotic support could rescue par- <dig> polarization wild-type worms expressing par-2::gfp were fed gna- <dig> rnai, chs- <dig> rnai or cej-1+b <dig>  cornai, and embryos were dissected quickly in  <dig> mm kcl followed by freeze-fracture , or were dissected in minimal egm  <cit>  and incubated at 22°c for  <dig> min before freeze fracture. instead of m <dig>   <dig> mm kcl was used as a control because gna- <dig>  chs- <dig> or cej-1+b <dig>  embryos dissected in m <dig> are very fragile and usually break, whereas the kcl provides some osmotic support. however, dissection and freezing was completed in < <dig> min, which should not allow for reversal of polarity defects.

to examine meiotic spindles, meiotic dna segregation, polar-body extrusion, spcc-cortical association, pseudocleavage furrow formation and pronuclear migration, wild-type or gna- <dig> hermaphrodites expressing tubulin::gfp or histone h2b::gfp were transferred to agarose pads, and embryos were examined in utero, using a leica dmlsfa confocal microscope. the effect on meiotic dna segregation, polar-body extrusion, spcc-cortical association, pseudocleavage furrow formation and pronuclear migration of chs- <dig> or cej-1+b <dig>  was also determined in worms expressing histone h2b::gfp. for meiosis duration , timing was defined as follows:

• meiosis i: time from entry into the spermatheca until tubulin::gfp waned to a small spot . time from entry into the spermatheca was used instead of nuclear envelope breakdown  because it is easily and objectively assessed without dic optics, and because it excludes any oocytes that undergo nebd but fail to be ovulated  in a timely manner.

• meiosis ii: time from the end of meiosis i  until the meiosis ii spindle waned to a very pale structure.

• meiosis i + ii: time from entry into the spermatheca until the meiosis ii spindle waned to a very pale structure.

as an additional way to determine meiotic timing, we also examined chromosome segregation using histone h2b::gfp. timing was defined as follows:

• meiosis i: time from entry into the spermatheca until chromatin masses were separated .

• meiosis ii: time from entry into the spermatheca until chromatin masses were separated a second time .

• pronuclear meeting: time from entry into the spermatheca until maternal and paternal pronuclei met.

failure of the spcc to associate closely with the cortex was scored as any embryo in which the sperm pronucleus  failed to come within half of the sperm pronuclear diameter of the cortex. results were analysed by t test  or one-way anova followed by tukey's multiple comparison test . lipophilic dye permeability was tested by dic/uv microscopy of living embryos dissected in  <dig> mm kcl containing  <dig> μm fm 4– <dig> .
