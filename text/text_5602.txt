BACKGROUND
among pattern recognition receptors , toll-like receptors  are prominent as cellular sensors of extracellularly encountered whole microbes or viruses, or pathogen associated molecular patterns   <cit> . infection of hosts is associated with release of immune-stimulatory pamps such as lps upon gram-negative bacterial infection or lipoproteins and dna upon virtually any bacterial infection  <cit> . systemic presence of pamps at high concentrations and subsequent overamplification of immune responses through tlrs is recognized as a major cause of sepsis for which high serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators such as nitrogen monoxide and tnfα, as well as consequent hypotension and disseminated coagulation are characteristic. sepsis frequently culminates upon multi-organ failure in fatal septic shock  <cit> . chronic inflammation for which persisting infection is viewed as one major trigger might be maintained through prr activation  <cit> . targeting of prrs such as cd <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig> in models of acute infection within which deliberate short term antagonism is achieved by systemic application of neutralizing mabs has been shown to effectively inhibit unwanted immune responses  <cit> . however, strategies aiming at sustainable prr antagonism have not yet been brought forward.

as opposed to blockade of the ligand binding domain of prrs, inhibition of intracellular translocation of tlrs from the endoplasmatic reticulum  to the cell surface or endosomal compartment would require a cytoplasmic entry to inhibit tlr function and rely on an alternative strategy. since intracellular antibodies  can be targeted to specific subcellular compartments upon fusion to specific signal peptides  or expressed inside the cytoplasm, they might be helpful for targeting prrs. inside the subcellular compartment the intrabody binds its cognate target  <cit> . thereby intrabodies might supplement knock-down approaches such as antisense rna or rnai/sirna/shrna application potentially inducing off-target effects  <cit> . major advantages of intrabodies include high specificity, substantial length of active half-life, opportunity of targeting protein domains or epitopes, as well as inhibition of post-translational modification. an intrinsic prerequisite of the intrabody technique is availability of a mab against a specific target protein. if this need is met, cloning of the two dna sequences encoding the variable domains of the specific mab allows construction of a single chain fv intrabody construct fused to specific signal peptides for targeting of specific subcellular compartments.

intrabodies residing within the er due to an er retention peptide fused to the c-terminus of the respective intrabody, have been shown to efficiently block translocation of otherwise secreted or cell surface bound molecules to the cell surface  <cit> . er intrabodies have been applied successfully for inactivation of oncogenic receptors as well as inhibition of virus envelope proteins and virus-receptor molecules expressed on the surface of host cells. recent reports provide examples for blockade of translocation from the er to the cell surface of specific antigens such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptors   <dig> and tie <dig>  the human immunodeficiency virus   <dig> coat protein gp <dig>  as well as the hiv- <dig> coreceptor cc-chemokin-receptor   <dig>  <cit> . in addition several receptors of the immune system have been knocked down with er intrabodies .

specifically, er intrabodies carrying c-terminally the er retention peptide kdel or sekdel bind to er retention defective   <dig> receptor localized at the inner surface of the er and at the same time recognize their specific antigen. the er intrabody-target protein complex is recycled via the cis golgi network apparatus to the er  <cit> . the intrabody-antigen complex retained in the er is then being degraded possibly inside the er  <cit>  or by a cytoplasmic proteosome-dependent  <cit>  or proteosome-independent pathway . intrinsically, er intrabodies are folded correctly due to interaction with molecular chaperones and the oxidizing environment of the er, which favors intra-domain disulfide bond formation  <cit> .

here we describe the generation and characterisation of an anti-tlr <dig> scfv er intrabody . αt2ib binds intracellularly and specifically to tlr <dig> as shown by co-immunoprecipitation as well as efficient retention and accumulation of tlr <dig> inside the er upon overexpression of αt2ib. as a consequence, tlr <dig> surface expression and tlr2-specific activation of murine macrophages is inhibited in vitro and ex vivo. our data indicate a therapeutic potential of αt2ib since it sustainably prevents tlr2-driven inflammatory immune responses.

RESULTS
αt2ib expression and functionality upon transient overexpression in hek <dig> cells
the sequence of the αt2ib expression construct was as illustrated . cmv promoter driven αt2ib expression in transfected hek <dig> cells was detected by immunoblot  and immunofluorescence . the apparent molecular weight of αt2ib was approximately  <dig> kda . in order to analyse αt2ib function, nf-κb driven reporter gene activity in hek <dig> cells overexpressing both mtlr <dig> and αt2ib upon tlr <dig> specific challenge was determined. transfection of αt2ib expression plasmid dna effectively inhibited tlr <dig> activity . in contrast, cellular activation through either tlr4-md- <dig>  tlr <dig>  or tlr <dig> was not influenced by αt2ib coexpression . another er intrabody recognizing vascular endothelial growth factor receptor   <dig> did not diminish tlr <dig> activation . in addition, an αt2ib dose-dependent inhibition of tlr <dig> cell surface expression was observed . moreover, the control-intrabody αvr-ib hardly diminished tlr <dig> cell surface expression to a detectable extent .

colocalization of αt2ib and tlr <dig> inside the er compartment and intracellular binding of αt2ib to tlr2
fluorescent labeling revealed colocalization of αt2ib with mtlr <dig> indicating complex formation of both molecules . the αt2ib-mtlr <dig> complex resided within a lattice structure identical with the er compartment. this interpretation was supported by costaining of the intrabody-tlr <dig> complex with the er resident marker calnexin . overexpression of αt2ib led to strong accumulation of tlr <dig> inside the er. this accumulation was not seen when tlr <dig> was coexpressed with the unspecific control-intrabody . specific intracellular binding of tlr <dig> and αt2ib was indicated further by co-immunoprecipitation . lack of immunoprecipitation of tlr <dig> with control intrabody  in lysates of hek <dig> cells expressing respective protein pairs demonstrated αt2ib specificity for its cognate antigen.

adenoviral αt2ib expression and effects in macrophages
to increase overexpression of αt2ib in macrophages and mice, we constructed an adenoviral vector and generated advαt2ib particles. myc-tag specific immunoblot analysis of lysates of raw <dig>  macrophages that had been infected with advαt2ib or the control virus advgfp  <dig> days before revealed an apparent size of adenovirally transduced αt2ib of approximately  <dig> kda . adenovirus mediated αt2ib expression resembled that of αt2ib expressed upon dna plasmid or dna adenoviral cosmid transfection in respect to resultant protein size . next, we analysed intrabody expression and bicistronically expressed egfp by immunofluorescence determination through both, flow cytometry and microscopy. both adenoviral constructs advgfp and advαt2ib transduced raw <dig>  macrophages equally effectively . challenge of advgfp or advαt2ib infected raw <dig>  macrophages with tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> agonists for  <dig> h did not alter their egfp-driven fluorescence . infection rates of raw <dig>  macrophages were in the 80% range as revealed by egfp and myc-tag specific elisa of cell lysates . in order to analyse the effect of αt2ib expression on cell surface tlr <dig> expression, we performed flow cytometry of cells left uninfected and those formerly infected either with advαt2ib or advgfp. tlr <dig> cell surface expression was well detectable on non-infected hek <dig> cells stable overexpressing murine tlr <dig>  as well as on murine raw <dig>  macrophages . furthermore, adenovirally overexpressed egfp had no substantial impact on cell surface tlr <dig> expression by hek293/mtlr <dig> cells, raw <dig>  macrophages, as well as primary macrophages . however, neither both of the two different cell lines, nor primary macrophages expressed surface tlr <dig> to a detectable degree given they had been infected with advαt2ib before . next we determined αt2ib specificity by comparative analysis of surface tlr <dig> expression. both hek <dig> cells overexpressing a flag-tagged mtlr4-md- <dig> complex as well as raw <dig>  macrophages displayed significant tlr4-specific staining  which was reduced in hek <dig> cells possibly due to reduced mtlr4-md- <dig> complex expression in favor of expression of tranduced egfp . notably, tlr <dig> expression was not different to a significant extent on the cell surface of both cell lines given they were infected with either advgfp or advαt2ib before  indicating specificity of αt2ib for tlr <dig>  furthermore, αt2ib did not interfere with expression of the macrophage marker cd11b on raw <dig>  cells .

inhibition of tlr <dig> specific signal transduction through αt2ib expression
aiming at analysis of αt2ib effects on cell activation at the mrna level we challenged raw <dig>  macrophages with tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> specific agonists upon specific adenoviral infection. later, mrna levels were determined by rt pcr. within the time period of  <dig> h pam3csk <dig> and lps challenge induced increase of cellular accumulation of both tnfα and il- <dig> mrna regardless of whether cells were left uninfected or had been infected with advgfp . cells infected with advαt2ib responded similarly if challenged with lps. in sharp contrast, neither il- <dig> mrna, nor tnfα mrna were found in pam3csk <dig> challenged macrophages that expressed αt2ib upon adenoviral infection . asking for tnfα induction on the protein level, we performed intracellular flow cytometry of intrabody expressing raw <dig>  cells upon gating on gfp positive cells. as shown in fig. 7b, αt2ib expression inhibited intracellular tnfα accumulation whereas tlr <dig> specific activation induced through lps challenge was not affected in respect to tnfα production. adenoviral infection as such had no effect on constitutive or tlr ligand induced tnfα expression since advgfp infected cells produced as much of intracellular tnfα as non-infected macrophages . thus, release of tnfα depended on tlr specific challenge. while noninfected cells responded to tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> specific challenge by releasing tnfα at substantial amounts which was true to an almost equal degree for cells infected with advgfp, cells that were infected with advαt2ib were unable to respond to a tlr <dig> specific challenge accordingly as shown for raw <dig>  and peritoneal macrophages .

effectiveness of systemic αt2ib transduction
we proceeded with analysis of cells from systemically αt2ib transduced mice. therefore, mice were adenovirally infected by i. v. injection of virus particles.  <dig> days after infection viable splenocytes were analysed for expression of bicistronically expressed egfp by flow cytometry . whereas splenocytes from non-infected mice were devoid of egfp expression, mice infected with control virus or virus driving αt2ib expression expressed egfp to well detectable degrees in their splenocytes . next we analysed cd11b+ peritoneal wash out cells from mice that had been adenovirally infected either i. v. or i. p. upon thioglycolate injection  <dig> days earlier for egfp expression. while peritoneal macrophages from mice that had not been infected expressed no detectable egfp, those of i. v. infected mice contained egfp+ cells. in contrast, in those mice that had been infected i. p. the entirety of the peritoneal macrophage population displayed increased egfp expression as compared to cells from control mice . consequently, peritoneal macrophages from mice formerly infected i. p. with advαt2ib but not from advgfp or non-infected mice were impaired in their ability to respond to low dose tlr <dig> agonist challenge while they were fully responsive to control stimulant . similarly, splenocytes that descended from mice that had formerly been infected with advαt2ib but not from those infected with advgfp displayed diminished responsiveness to tlr2-specific but not to tlr7-specific challenge .

discussion
means for prevention of excessive inflammatory immune actions are of substantial medical interest  <cit> . a major trigger of inflammation is infection, which is sensed through pattern recognition receptors  by the host. among signal transducing prrs are tlrs, which as type i receptors mediate specific signals from the extracellular milieu into the cytoplasm  <cit> . cellular prrs such as cell surface expressed cd <dig>  tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> have been blocked by application of soluble antagonists carried by the serum. however, antagonism of extracellular domains is only transient due to turn-over of surface receptors and limited half-time of serum contents. treatment of long lasting or chronic inflammatory disease, however, might rely on sustained receptor blockage. likewise, blockage of intracellularly localized prrs would require an alternative approach. referring to this, intrabodies have accomplished both persistent and intracellular blockade of receptors involved in cell cycle progression or cell growth  <cit> . therefore, we generated an er-bound intrabody towards tlr <dig> to evaluate its propensity for tlr <dig> blockade by tlr <dig> arrestment in the er. αt2ib was derived from an antagonistic mab towards both human and murine tlr <dig>  <cit>  and inhibited translocation of tlr <dig> to the cell surface and tlr <dig> specific signal transduction both in vitro and ex vivo.

the variable domains of t <dig>  were fused via a peptide linker and linked at the construct's c-terminus to the myc epitope followed by the er retention peptide to a scfv-fragment named αt2ib . αt2ib expression was normal as compared to expression levels of previously generated intrabodies. having an apparent size of  <dig> kda, αt2ib specifically inhibited tlr <dig> driven cell activation since αt2ib effectiveness depended on tlr <dig> agonist dose and αt2ib did not inhibit activity of other tlrs such as tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  notably, αt2ib did not only inhibit cell surface expression and function of murine tlr <dig>  but also of ectopically expressed human tlr <dig> . furthermore, a control intrabody towards vegfr <dig> did not interfere with activity of any of the tlrs tested. αt2ib dose dependently inhibited tlr <dig> cell surface expression whereas the transfection of a control intrabody  expression plasmid only marginally affected tlr <dig> cell surface expression.

αt2ib-driven inhibition was due to retention and accumulation of the formed intrabody-tlr <dig> complex inside the er mediated by the er retention sequence. we showed colocalisation of tlr <dig> and αt2ib inside the er compartment upon synchronous staining with the er-resident marker calnexin as well as specific binding of αt2ib to tlr <dig> by co-immunoprecipitation.

aiming at effective transduction of murine macrophages we subcloned the αt2ib expression cassette into an adenoviral vector which drove bicistronic egfp expression aside of αt2ib expression. infection rates of raw <dig>  macrophages were in the 80% range as revealed by egfp. human macrophages specifically human alveolar macrophages have been reported to express low levels of car  <cit> . nevertheless other authors used also adenoviral vectors to study biological effects in raw  <dig>  macrophages or peritoneal mouse macrophages  <cit> . recently it was shown that the scavenger receptor a is responsible for uptake of adenovirus type  <dig> in j <dig> macrophages  <cit> . the exact mechanism of the entry of recombinant adenovirus in raw  <dig>  macrophages has not yet been studied. since the raw  <dig>  macrophages also express the scavenger receptor a, entry of the adenovirus might be mediated by it. we suggest that it might be possible that the efficient transduction could also be due to macropinocytosis or phagocytosis triggered by the recombinant adenovirus  <cit> .

the size of αt2ib expressed upon advαt2ib infection was similar as compared to αt2ib expression which was driven by transfected plasmid or cosmid. notable, advαt2ib infection reduced surface tlr <dig> expression to almost baseline levels. peritoneal macrophages infected ex vivo by adenovirus to express control protein expressed tlr <dig> at their surface to similar extent compared to non-infected macrophages. however, advαt2ib infection resulted in abrogation of tlr <dig> cell surface expression. lack of interference of adenovirally transduced αt2ib with surface tlr <dig> expression emphasized tlr <dig> specificity .

inhibitory effects of αt2ib extended to tlr <dig> induced signal transduction since tlr <dig> specific induction of gene activities was ablated in addition to diminished surface tlr <dig> expression. in contrast, macrophages infected with advαt2ib did increase inflammatory cytokine mrna accumulation upon lps challenge . at the same time house keeping gene expression was not impaired. namely, both intracellular tnfα accumulation and cellular release of tnfα upon tlr2-specific challenge were at background level if αt2ib was expressed and in both cases tlr <dig> specific cellular challenge was unimpaired. these findings indicated both high effectiveness, as well as high specificity of tlr <dig> retention in the er.

to translate results of our analyses in vitro to the systemic level, we infected naive mice with advαt2ib by i. v. injection, as well as mice that had been thioglycolate challenged  <dig> days earlier by i. p. injection of the adenovirus.  <dig> d after infection egfp expression as an indication of αt2ib expression was evident upon infection i.v. in splenocytes regardless of whether mice had been infected with advαt2ib or advgfp. even peritoneal washout cells expressed egfp to a detectable degree regardless of whether mice had been transduced by infection through the i. v. or the i. p. route before. consequently, those macrophages that originated from mice that had been infected with advαt2ib were refractory of responsiveness specifically to tlr <dig> specific challenge in vitro similar to cells from uninfected tlr2-/- mice.

to our knowledge these data are first to show that intracellular arrestment of a tlr by an er intrabody inhibits specific tlr activity. the specificity of mabs might be an advantage outweighing potentially competing approaches such as application of agents that interfere with gene activation at the mrna level  <cit> . whether other vectors might accommodate the αt2ib encoding nucleic acid more appropriately remains an open question  <cit> . new approaches including transcriptional and transductional targeting are promising in this context  <cit> . yet, our data clearly indicate highly effective function of αt2ib that extends from nearly abolished tlr <dig> cell surface expression to low cytokine release from cells upon confrontation with tlr <dig> agonists. consequently,  <dig> d after initiation of systemic adenoviral transduction immune cells were resistant to tlr <dig> specific challenge. further analysis will determine the time frame of αt2ib activity from adenoviral infection on. intrabody mediated prr blockade as compared to regular mab mediated prr blockage might not only constitute an exclusive way to target intracellularly localized receptors using mabs but also be advantageous for blockade of those prrs a possibly minor portion of which is expressed superficially such as tlr <dig>  an obvious field of anti-tlr intrabody application might be chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, or arthritis because it might call for sustained anti-inflammatory action. tlrs have been implicated as initial signal transmitters under such clinical conditions  <cit> . a future perspective is the evaluation of the efficacy of αt2ib in mouse models of chronic infections. furthermore the intrabody strategy might be used to block tlr <dig> specific tnfα secretion of myeloid cells induced by factors secreted from tumour cells promoting metastasis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we generated and characterised an anti-tlr <dig> er intrabody that inhibits specifically and very efficiently macrophage surface tlr <dig> expression and tlr2-driven cell activation in vitro and ex vivo. this indicates a therapeutic potential of αt2ib for treatment of tlr2-driven chronic inflammatory disease.
