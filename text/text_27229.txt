BACKGROUND
modern biological sciences rely on the worldwide interchange of results published in peer reviewed journals and indexed in a freely accessible database such as pubmed, provided by the  national center for biotechnology information . pubmed currently  contains over  <dig> million abstracts, and grows at a pace of one more abstract per minute. retrieving pertinent information from this vast resource requires cutting-edge text mining methods capable of resolving the meaning of ambiguous words which are widely spread in the biological literature. genome-wide approaches are largely used to search for genes that cause diseases or regulate physiological conditions of interest. these techniques often identify many hundreds of candidate genes. selection of the most probable of these candidate genes for further empirical analysis requires integration of data-mining of gene expression data and text-mining of biomedical literature. when searching information about genes or proteins in the biomedical literature, two main problems arise. one is to relate information in different documents that refer to the same gene but use different symbols. querying pubmed using only the official gene symbols will produce only a subset of the actual text corpus associated with that gene and relevant information may be skipped. the other problem, probably more intricate, is to recognize the contextual meaning of single gene symbols that may refer to multiple genes, or may also be the abbreviation of terms with completely different, non-gene meanings  <cit> . to provide the reader with an idea about the relevance of these two problems, it has been estimated that at least 30% of human genes are affected by homonymy  <cit> . the challenging task of resolving these ambiguities is further aggravated by the fact that only 30% of the gene symbols in pubmed abstracts are accompanied by a matching long form  <cit> .

a wide variety of approaches have been proposed to assign proper sense to an ambiguous term. in the biological field, supervised machine learning methods have been proposed for disambiguation of gene names/aliases  <cit> . a drawback of these methods is that they require a number of training examples for each of the possible senses. these training sets are often difficult to obtain. for example, podowski et al  <cit>  used bayesian classifier models to disambiguate gene symbols found in locuslink. their system can distinguish between gene and non-gene meanings of a symbol. in their proof of concept experiment using  <dig> manually curated gene symbols, they reached an accuracy of 90%, but only when more than  <dig> abstracts per gene meaning were available for training. alternatively, schijvenaars and cols.  <cit>  developed a method which relies on a thesaurus to find biomedical concepts in text containing gene symbols. this strategy consists in “concept fingerprinting” reference documents associated with a given gene name and then comparing the “concept fingerprints” of the reference set with those of documents in the test set.

we present herein an original method for estimating the ambiguity level of individual aliases in large gene terminologies based exclusively in their name-specific vocabulary fingerprints automatically extracted from the literature. these vocabulary fingerprints are extracted from text corpora of pubmed abstracts using a previously published algorithm  <cit> . the method can deal with the two major problems restricting the usage of current text mining tools: 1) different names associated with the same gene; 2) and one name associated with multiple genes, or even with non-gene meanings. moreover, this method does not require training examples which is a major advantage compared to supervised approaches.

RESULTS
the final text corpus
the initial gene terminology comprised  <dig> entrezgene official gene symbols and  <dig> aliases, accounting for  <dig> cases. the casuistic of the study was meant to reflect the scale of a typical literature or pathway mining exercise in support of a focused gene expression analysis. pubmed abstracts were retrieved for  <dig> official gene symbols and  <dig> aliases, forming a text corpus of  <dig>  abstracts with 21% redundancy . redundancy may be in part explained by the same document being retrieved with different synonyms of a same gene. however, in some cases the same abstract refers to different genes, suggesting functional associations between them, despite the fact that they had been randomly chosen in this study. the full list of official gene symbols and aliases used in this study is presented in additional file 1: entrezgene official symbols with pubmed abstracts and its aliases classified by the algorithm, and in additional file 2: entrezgene official symbols without pubmed abstracts and their aliases.

* the algorithm requires the official gene symbol, and at least one alias and one internal control to produce text corpora of pubmed abstracts. additionally, the algorithm requires an informative group-specific vocabulary to pass the filters for ubiquitous terms.

** five official gene symbols, namely derl <dig>  kcna <dig>  kcnj <dig>  med <dig>  and tbrv4- <dig>  did not fulfil the algorithm’s requirements since their aliases produced no pubmed abstract.

because we aimed to assess the ambiguity level of a gene alias in the context of its group, the algorithm requires the official gene symbol, at least one alias and at least one internal control to produce text corpora of pubmed abstracts. additionally, the algorithm requires an informative group-specific vocabulary to pass the filters for ubiquitous terms, as described in the “methods” section. twenty-seven genes were automatically excluded because they produced no text corpora, even though  <dig> of their aliases had abstracts in pubmed . other  <dig> aliases whose official gene symbols had abstracts in pubmed did not produce text corpora when used to query pubmed and were automatically excluded from the analysis, and thus were not classified neither as synonyms, nor as ambiguous. their exclusion did not affect the analysis of their respective genes, i.e., their official gene symbols and aliases with abstracts . alias h <dig> of the hmx <dig> gene  had pubmed abstracts but was excluded because its informative vocabulary did not pass the filters for ubiquitous terms. hmx <dig> had one alias classified as synonym: “homeo box  1”. five genes  out of  <dig>  whose official gene symbols produced text corpora were excluded because none of their aliases had pubmed abstracts .

fine tuning the algorithm’s parameters
we assessed the effect of increasing the stringency of vocabulary filtering by testing three thresholds of baseline cut-off , i.e.:  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . this means that any term which frequency in the baseline abstract collection was equal of greater than  <dig>   <dig>  or 1%, accordingly to the c value chosen, was automatically excluded from the vocabulary of the group. these terms are considered broadly spread in the unspecific literature and might not be useful to discriminate any specific entity. increasing the stringency did not influence the number of genes  in the final dataset  and had only a minor effect on the number of aliases passing the filters . increasing the stringency to  <dig>  significantly reduced the size of the group-specific vocabularies . however, this effect was not accompanied by any significant increase in the delta of the jaccard distance between the official gene symbols and their respective aliases, and between the official symbols and the internal controls .

proof of concept using the baseline cut-off =  <dig> 
the average number of aliases per gene in the final dataset was  <dig>  . jaccard distances were calculated between the official gene symbol and its aliases or unrelated internal controls in the group in order to enable the determination of the ambiguity of a symbol. in this proof of concept study, we classified an alias as “ambiguous” when its jaccard distance to its respective official gene symbol was equal of greater than the jaccard distance between its official symbol and any internal control . using this threshold we were able to disclose  <dig> “ambiguous” aliases for  <dig> genes . after excluding the “ambiguous” aliases, the average number of synonyms per gene in the dataset shrunk to  <dig>  . .

the average number of abstracts retrieved per official gene symbol was  <dig>  . combining the abstracts obtained querying pubmed with official gene symbols and their respective aliases classified as “synonyms” increased the average size of text corpora to  <dig>  abstracts / gene. redundancy accounted for only  <dig>  % of the global text corpus  . in overall, querying pubmed with official gene symbols and “synonym” aliases allowed a  <dig> fold increase in the number of unique documents retrieved.

we estimated the algorithm’s performance by measuring the frequencies of official gene symbols in the abstract collections retrieved querying pubmed with their respective aliases classified as “synonym” or “ambiguous”. official gene symbols occurred in  <dig>  %  of the abstract collections retrieved with their respective “synonyms”. no official gene symbol was mentioned in any abstract collection retrieved with its respective “ambiguous” aliases. these results confirm that the present method is able to distinguish between unambiguous and ambiguous gene aliases based exclusively on the vocabulary present in their associated literature. acknowledging official gene symbols are not necessarily mentioned in the literature of their respective gene aliases, the percentages above should not be mistaken as a measure of the sensitivity / specificity of the method.

two case studies to assess the enrichment in relevant information about a gene obtained by querying pubmed with “synonym” aliases
querying pubmed with the official symbol fads <dig> produced a text corpus comprising  <dig> abstracts all related to this gene . in this text corpus we found that the delta- <dig> desaturase, encoded by fads <dig>  is a rate-limiting enzyme in the desaturation of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid  <cit> , which is incorporated in phospholipids and is a precursor of molecules involved in inflammation and immune response. indeed, fatty acid composition of serum phospholipids is genetically controlled by the fads <dig> fads <dig> gene cluster  <cit> . hepatic desaturase activities have been implicated in insulin resistance, obesity and dyslipidaemia  <cit> . nevertheless, fads <dig> is differentially expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit>  and its methylation has been reported in primary gastric cancer  <cit> .

when the alias d5d, classified as "synonym" by our method, is used to query pubmed,  <dig> abstracts were retrieved . only one abstract  was indexed in pubmed to both the official gene symbol fads <dig> and the “synonym” alias d5d. ten out of these  <dig> abstracts were not related to fads <dig> . however, in the remaining abstracts indexed only to d5d we found that: a) d5d expression is dual regulated by srebp-1c and pparalpha in mice  <cit> ; b) and by dietary vitamin a and exogenous retinoic acid in liver of adult rats  <cit> ; c) the ratio of administered n <dig> to n <dig> fatty acids regulates the transcription of fads <dig> in human hepatocytes  <cit> ; d) in hl <dig> cells, a promyelocytic cell line resembling human leukocytes, when the supply of fatty acids is limited, the intracellular content of n <dig> and n <dig> fatty acids decreases and this leads to up regulation of d5d  <cit> ; e) intake of high saturated fatty acids and monosaturated fatty acids appears to increase expression of d5d in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, whilst essential fatty acids intake appears to decrease expression of d5d  <cit> ; f) low d5d activity is associated with metabolic syndrome independent of lifestyle factors such as smoking, physical activity, etc  <cit> ; g) peroxisome proliferators , besides increasing fatty acid degradation, induces fads <dig> as a compensatory response to an increased demand for unsaturated fatty acids  <cit> .

eight abstracts in pubmed were indexed to the "synonym" alias "fatty acid desaturase 1" ; five out of them were indexed to both fads <dig> and the "synonym" alias "fatty acid desaturase 1" . among the remaining three abstracts indexed only to “fatty acid desaturase 1”, the first one reported decreased expression levels of “fatty acid desaturase 1” in women under treatment with estrogen  <cit> . the second abstract reported “fatty acid desaturase 1” up regulation in dystrophic muscles of patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy  <cit> . the third abstract reported that fatty acid desaturase  <dig> from capsicum annum  may play a role in hypersensitivity response induced by infection with tabacco mosaic virus. the authors demonstrated that suppression of “fatty acid desaturase 1” caused blocking of cell death induced by bcl2-associated x  protein in tabacco plants  <cit> .

finally, three abstracts  were indexed in pubmed to the alias tu <dig> classified as “ambiguous” by our method; none of them are related to fads <dig>  it became clear from these findings that tu <dig> had been erroneously assigned as an alias of fads <dig> in the gate terminology used in this study.

llcdl <dig> and fadsd <dig>  two aliases of fads <dig> which were present in the initial gene name list  extracted from gate had no abstracts in pubmed and thus, could not be classified by the algorithm which is based on literature profiling.

thus, querying pubmed with the official gene symbol fads <dig> and its aliases classified as “synonyms” by our method lead to a  <dig>  fold increase in the number of unique and relevant abstracts retrieved compared to the situation when only the official gene symbol is used to compose the query . important information was found only in the additional abstracts indexed to the “synonym” aliases but not to the official gene symbol. on the contrary, the “ambiguous” alias produced only documents that were not related to fads <dig> 

in a second case study, the gene add <dig>  encoding the adducing  <dig> isoform a, was analyzed. adducins are cytoskeletal actin-binding proteins and take part in the junctional complexes. among their various know functions, they are constituents of synaptic structure  <cit>  and play a role in cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis  <cit> . adducins alpha and beta  have been implicated in hypertension  <cit>  and renal dysfunction  <cit> . when the official gene symbol  was used to query pubmed,  <dig> abstracts with pertinent information were retrieved . curiously, one abstract  indexed by pubmed to add <dig> refers to arrested development  in arabdopsis. querying pubmed with the synonym alias “adducing  <dig> isoform a” produced a text corpora with  <dig> abstracts  from which only one was not pertinent ; another abstract  was also present in the text corpus of the official gene symbol add <dig>  this means an information increment of ~ <dig>  fold when using the official gene symbol and the synonym alias to query pubmed. the ambiguous alias addb had  <dig> abstracts in pubmed , but none were related to add <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the method presented herein estimates the ambiguity level of gene aliases based on their vocabulary fingerprint extracted from their respective abstract corpora downloaded from pubmed. this original approach does not require training sets of manually curated documents and only needs to be loaded once to a whole gene terminology. no information is lost because, since the aliases have been scored, customized cut-off thresholds can be applied to specific aims. the method could be used in the generation of more powerful queries to retrieve literature of significance to the study of a particular gene.
