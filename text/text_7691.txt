BACKGROUND
hepatocellular carcinoma  is the most common liver malignancy and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. its incidence has been especially prevalent among asian populations. due to hcc being the top cause of cancer death worldwide, research on its cause, diagnosis, and treatment continues into the post-genomic era. however, the carcinogenesis of hcc still remains poorly understood.

in the post-genomic era, advances in tools and technologies have provided an excellent opportunity to better understand the complex interaction of hepatocarcinogenesis. for example, genome-wide microarray technologies, which are widely used to monitor global gene expression in cancer  <cit> , have identified numerous differentially expressed genes and enable cancer research to succeed where traditional methods have faltered. these high-throughput analyses have revolutionized the way that hcc is diagnosed and classified. it is generally believed that microarrays are well able to shed light on the identification of disease markers for diagnosis and potential targets for treatment. however, there are several bottlenecks associated with moving from microarray profiling to target identifications. the challenges include:  infrastructural challenges, such as the creation of data models and databases for storing data, the integration of data with external databases and the extraction of information from natural language text;  information overload, where there are many hcc-related microarray studies  <cit> , the gene annotations are scattered across different databases and the content is difficult to update or improve. moreover, an exponential growth in both the number and the size of specialized biological databases has also made the task of performing cross-site browsing or iterative querying very tedious and challenging. there have been several attempts, such as genewebex  <cit>  and gena  <cit>  to integrate cross-site information, but these often lack adequate annotation related to hcc. all this calls for the establishment of an infrastructure that can collect such scattered annotations, present them in a user-friendly way, and allow viewers to participate actively in its making.

to embrace the paradigm shift to the next generation of the web and to provide web-based services, we have designed an information harvesting infrastructure, encyclopedia of hepatocellular carcinoma genes online, dubbed ehco, which employs softbots  to collect scattered gene annotations either by mining data sources directly or by querying publicly accessible databases. to overcome the obstacles that ehco reports merely descriptive results from various studies, we notice that protein bindings from gene ontology analysis represent the largest proportion  in the molecular function category. by using available protein-protein interaction datasets, a highly interactive biological network and novel hubs can be revealed among these seemingly random hcc inventories.

RESULTS
the architecture of ehco
ehco adapts the plone platform, an open source content management system  with a workflow engine, pre-configured security and a set of content types, to create an infrastructure to support flexible storage and presentation . the advantage of using plone is that plone supports wiki so that ehco can be extended beyond the context of hcc research. one example is liver fibrosis  <cit> , a sister site of ehco, which provides liver necroinflammatory and fibrosis-related gene knowledge  <cit> . both sites shared the same server, same plone, the same mysql database, and most of the python codes. the uniqueness of ehco lies in its ability to allow registered users to contribute their own work to ehco to create an integrated biological information portal for efficient information sharing and extensive aggregation of research-related topics. to achieve the uniqueness, ehco uses zwiki as its content management and presentation platform. zwiki is one of many open-source wiki platforms freely available online. with zwiki, users can collaboratively create their new web pages to enrich the contents of ehco.

the differentially expressed gene set collections in ehco
a fundamental part of ehco is the collection of eight gene sets related to hcc either from pubmed or diverse high-throughput studies . since different labs obtained all gene sets independently at different time, they used a wide variety of gene ids and appeared in many cases with different gene names, resulting in difficulty in gene id comparisons. therefore, we established gene name service  <cit> , a comprehensive gene name cross-reference database, to unify all of the aliases automatically. since the amount of biomedical literatures available on the web is rapidly increasing, manual information extraction from search results is usually unable to identify articles of interest immediately. therefore, in the pubmed section, we had extracted  <dig>  genes  from approximately  <dig>  abstracts in the pubmed category  . for those genes that either do not have hugo-approved gene names or fail to be included from pubmed search, they were placed under tablex when reading the articles. among the hcc-related microarray studies, ehco was further reorganized into five gene sets. differentially expressed hcc-related gene sets were collected from four major studies, including chen et al.,  <cit>  , neo et al.,  <cit>  , lee et al.,  <cit>  , and kim et al.,  <cit>  , and ten additional reports  <cit> , which were manually keyed in and are referred to as tablex_mrna. the differentially expressed genes collected from these sets ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . similarly, eight proteomics reports  <cit> , which represented relatively small collections of  <dig> proteins, were also manually keyed in and are referred to as tablex_protein. in addition, the sage dataset  <cit>  was collected from cgap library by using a 2-fold difference in tumor vs. non-tumor sample as criteria, resulting in a gene set of  <dig> genes.

intersection genes
among the eight gene set collections, there are  <dig> non-redundant genes in total. figure 2a shows the intersection between each gene set. the biggest intersection, which contained  <dig> genes, appeared between smd <dig> and pubmed. interestingly,  <dig> % smd <dig>  and  <dig> % pubmed  collections  had not been reported in other gene sets. similarly, a comparison was made that revealed 77% genes were only counted once among each gene set , suggesting that tremendous efforts will be needed to characterize the relationship between hcc and these genes generated from diverse measurements. a cross-dataset comparison of sage and five microarray datasets  revealed the top  <dig> intersection genes, which appeared at least  <dig> times in ehco, among each gene set.  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes shared consistent gene expression patterns   . in contrast,  <dig> genes had discrepancies in hcc expression patterns . this might be the result of changes in gene expression associated with different pathophysiological states, the type of sample collected, etc. fortunately, three out of four had pubmed records, including fabp <dig> , igfbp <dig> , and sgk . since we did not have an unbiased method to distinguish the accuracy of nnmt, q-rt-pcr was applied to evaluate the expression patterns by using  <dig> pairwised hcc patient specimens. the down-regulation profiles were observed in  <dig> out of  <dig> paired samples analyzed . in addition to nnmt, we chose peg <dig>  <cit> , which also had contradictory expression patterns in our collections, and performed q-rt-pcr to validate the gene expression signatures. figure 3b showed that overexpression of peg <dig> was observed in  <dig> out of  <dig> hcc patient samples. altogether, the majority of ehco collections  appeared only once and there were some discrepancies among gene sets, indicative of a need for an immediate further validation of these different measurements by using different hcc samples. therefore, we especially welcome other investigators to contribute their validation data to our ehco data warehouse.

pathway and chromosome assignments
pathway information is important for an understanding of the functionality of genes and proteins. ehco integrated two well-known pathway databases, kegg  <cit>  and biocarta  <cit> . figure 2c and 2d show the top five kegg and biocarta pathways that have the most hcc-related genes associated with them in these two public accessible pathway collections. out of ehco's current collections,  <dig> genes were identified as part of the associated pathways from kegg. the most associated pathway is cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, which has  <dig> genes associated with it. the most associated pathway in biocarta is the mapk signaling pathway, which has  <dig> genes associated with it. interestingly, these two public accessible pathway analyzers did not have a similar dataset for their top  <dig> collections except for the mapk signaling pathway. this is probably due to the fact that the primary areas of kegg collections are metabolic pathways whereas the coverage areas of biocarta are signaling pathways. moreover, analysis of chromosome distribution indicates that the largest proportion belongs to chromosome  <dig> , whereas y chromosome contains the least genes, namely only  <dig> ehco genes .

harvesting gene annotations through softbots and weblinks
the disease specific gene/protein expression pattern can provide important clues about gene function. currently, ~ <dig> genes-related to hcc are in our pubmed collections . to date, ehco has extended the hcc-related gene collections to  <dig>  genes. the study of these genes can be accelerated by functional annotations.

to organize diverse hcc-related datasets, the annotation handler stepped in to annotate the ehco collected gene sets. we use softbots  <cit>  to harvest gene annotations from various web resources. a softbot is an intelligent software robot that acts, on behalf of the user, to achieve certain goals. given the resources, which can be online websites, databases, or documents, a softbot extracts the information that it has been targeted to. since softbot can be fragile against changes to the online resources, we used a java program, called agent toolbox  <cit>  to create and maintain these softbots. agent toolbox 'learns' the information extraction rules from users' labels on the web page with a machine-learning algorithm  <cit> . as a result, we can efficiently repair and maintain our softbots. in this study, individual softbots were used to mine different targets. these programs will periodically update the latest information from ncbi databases and download them into ehco. finally, we created a presentation engine integrating all the information into a single user-friendly page view as "gene info" . as a result, each gene annotation webpage displays the most up-to-date information from various databases, e.g. ebi  <cit> , and smart  <cit> .

to rapidly interrogate the expression patterns of our collection, two gene sets  were used as templates to annotate our ehco collections. firstly, smd-hcc dataset reports not only those differentially expressed gene in smd <dig>  but also records the expression patterns of other genes , which are not statistically significant in the original data analysis. inclusion of this on-line quantitative evaluation of gene expression provides a rapid visualization of global trends in gene expression. secondly, we applied a natural language processing technique to extract information from the abstracts, followed by a summary table illustrating the gene and disease relationship. toward this goal, we have developed a tool, as described in the method section, to annotate genes, diseases, and other hcc-related information  from pubmed abstracts to provide a brief summary of each ehco genes.

detection of inferred biological network of hcc
the availability of hcc-related gene catalogs now enables elucidation of molecular mechanisms governing hepatocarcinogenesis at the systems level. however, these gene catalogs give no direct clues, at least not immediately evident from the gene symbols, to the underlying carcinogenesis processes. gene ontology  analysis  <cit> , which allows the identification of functional related clusters, indicates that protein binding from molecular function  and cellular physiological process from biological process  represent the largest proportion , respectively, in either category. this analysis raises the possibility that these hcc-related genes might not act alone randomly, but have a propensity to associate physically or functionally to perturb the fundamental biological processes of the liver.

to uncover the potential interaction networks or synergistic effects of these seemingly unrelated hcc-related genes, we employed each up-regulated gene set as queries and searched for their interaction partners by accessing our previously established protein-protein interaction  data  <cit> . figure 4c summarizes the analysis results. we used gis dataset as the first example because all tissue samples in the study were hbv-associated hcc patients. gis consists of  <dig> overexpressed genes, but  <dig> of them have no ppi information. of the remaining  <dig> queries,  <dig> of them  could interact with each other  and form  <dig> ppis. moreover,  <dig> queries serve as "hubs" , which are referred to as queries interact with more than one query in a given ppi network . next, we used lee_nih as the second example because this study was using mouse model to recapitulate the hcc and may provide novel insight toward the hepatocarcinogenesis. similarly, of  <dig> queries with available ppi data,  <dig> of them  can interact with each other to constitute  <dig> ppis and  <dig> hubs can be revealed . both queries in the inferred networks belong to primarily cellular physiological process and metabolism from biological process in go. together, transformation of these seemingly random genes into their corresponding ppi reveals the intrinsic dys-regulated biological network in hcc and highlights the potential new hubs for discovery of the potential hcc markers or therapeutic targets.

evaluation of "hubs" in the conserved hcc network at the systems level
it has been illustrated using the yeast ppi network that this network is scale-free, in which some proteins have many more interactions than others  <cit> . a survey of the yeast protein interaction network has revealed that proteins with more interactions are more important than those with fewer interacting proteins  <cit> , suggesting that hub degree is an indicator for essentialness in a network. however, it is difficult to address the essentialness of these newly identified hubs  from the inferred biological network as described in figure 4d and 4e. therefore, we employed the comparative genomics approach for the availability of knockout phenotype from various model organisms. to reduce the complexity, we focused on those genes only conserved in evolution, which may represent, at least in part, the dys-regulation of essential cellular physiological roles in hepatocarcinogenesis as concluded in go analysis . based on the homologene orthologues database ,  <dig> genes, consisting of  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated genes, out of  <dig> ehco collections are conserved range from h. sapiens, m. musculus, c. elegans, d. melanogaster, to s. cerevisiae . of  <dig> queries,  <dig> queries with ppi data were individually subjected to search for their interaction partners.  <dig> out of  <dig> queries  were associated with each other and there were  <dig> hubs  in this network. by using the available phenotypic information from wormbase  <cit> , flybase  <cit> , and sgd  <cit> , the percentage of nonviable phenotypes, e.g. embryonic or larval lethality, or sterility, in these  <dig> hubs was higher than those  <dig> queries . moreover, of these  <dig> hubs with more interaction proteins, the ratio of nonviable phenotype in yeast seemed to be higher than those with fewer interaction proteins . this analysis seems to be able to shed light on which research can be based to study potential new players in hcc research in the post-genomic era through the systems biology approach.

CONCLUSIONS
the collected genes or associated pathways in ehco may represent only small part of the whole genome or our understanding of hepatocarcinogenesis. this network construction supporting the view that well coordinated interaction networks may be required for these aberrant hcc-related genes to modulate hepatocarcinogenesis. targeting multiple hubs and/or disruption of the network formation could offer an excellent opportunity to reveal potential strategy for hcc treatment.
