BACKGROUND
digital dermatitis  is currently one of the main problems of the underfoot in cattle, both because of its high prevalence as well as because of it is painful and leads to significant welfare problems and economic losses for the livestock industry  <cit> . the disease was first reported in italy by cheli and mortellaro  <cit> , and has since then been recognized as an universal cause of lameness in cattle in many countries all over the world  <cit> .

the disease is characterized by a superficial dermatitis of the distal part of the foot. lesions present as painful, circular or oval erosions and may become granular, strawberry-like or rapidly progress to filiform warts with matted hair  <cit> . finally, healing is characterized by the presence of a dry, painless crust tightly adherent to the underlying healthy skin  <cit> . lesions are mostly located at the skin bordering the interdigital space on the palmar/plantar aspect of the foot, especially the hind foot, at the skin–horn junction of the heel bulbs or along the coronary band  <cit> . the skin bordering the dorsal interdigital cleft of the foot may also be involved  <cit> . in some papers, typical dd lesions are described also in the area of the dewclaws  <cit> . döpfer et al.  <cit>  classified clinical dd lesions into five different stages , mainly based on visual inspection of the lesions. m <dig> represents the normal digital skin without dd lesions; m <dig>  is characterized by an early small pink area of <  <dig> cm in diameter; m <dig>  is characterized by an acute classical ulcerative lesion > <dig> cm in diameter; m <dig>  represents the healing stage where the lesion typically is covered by a firm scab; and m <dig> represents the late chronic stage where the lesion is characterized by dyskeratosis or a proliferative overgrowth or both. few papers describe the histopathology of dd lesions. representative lesions are reported to be characterized by a thickening of the epidermis with superficial necrosis and hyperkeratosis, elongation of the rete ridges, and infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and eosinophils in both the epidermal and dermal layers  <cit> . until now however, these histopathologic features have not been matched with the clinical staging as described by döpfer et al.  <cit> .

digital dermatitis is considered a multifactorial disease with a strong bacterial component  <cit> . best candidate etiological bacterial agents of dd are treponema spp <cit> . epidemiologic studies indicate the presence of an excessive amount of mud or a generally moist environment as a paramount risk factor  <cit> , which was recently confirmed in a successful experimental infection model  <cit> . dairy cows appear to be at a significantly higher risk in comparison to beef cows, the incidence of the lesions being highest near peak lactation  <cit> . although the difference in incidence between dairy versus beef cows may be caused by differences in housing, recent studies suggest differences in susceptibility to be partly based on genetic backgrounds  <cit> .

although the disease is known for almost  <dig> years and a lot of papers have been dedicated to examining this disease, the exact pathogenesis is still not completely clear  <cit> . in this context, currently a lot of attention goes towards the reaction of the host in the establishment of the typical lesions, and in this respect the genetic makeup of the afflicted animal has recently been suggested to be of considerable importance  <cit> .

the main aim of the present study was to histopathologically and immunologically examine representative dd lesions belonging to the different clinical stages , in order to get a better insight into the host response associated with the typical lesions, in an attempt to further elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease.

methods
tissue collection
samples  representing the normal  and four different clinical stages of dd  were collected from feet of slaughtered cattle at the slaughter house. the history of the slaughtered cows and collected dd lesions was unknown. collected samples were taken as soon as possible after slaughter  either from the dorsal skin  or from the palmar/plantar skin  bordering the interdigital space. the number of m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> samples examined was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> respectively. classic full-thickness skin biopsies  from the dd lesions were taken for both histopathological  and immunological analyses .

histopathology
tissue specimens were embedded in paraffin wax, and sections of  <dig> μm thickness were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin  and examined by light microscopy. total epidermal thickness, the keratin layer thickness, and the length of the rete-ridges were measured at 25× or 50× magnification at  <dig> different randomly selected parts of the lesion . neutrophils and eosinophils, identified by their morphology under the light microscope, were counted in twenty randomly selected fields at 400× magnification. cells were counted as proportion of the total cell number in the dermis just underneath and along the basal layer of the epidermis.

immunohistochemistry
serial paraffin sections were cut at  <dig> μm thickness and mounted onto apes-coated glass slides. after de-paraffination and rehydration, antigen retrieval was achieved using sodium citrate. hydrogen peroxide was used to block the endogenous peroxidase activity for  <dig> minutes. sections were incubated  <dig> min at room temperature with anti-hcd <dig>  or anti-hcd <dig> . for detection of il <dig>  sections were incubated with anti-sheepil <dig>  overnight at 4°c. thereafter, slides were incubated with envision+system-hrp  for  <dig> min. finally, sections were covered with dab  for  <dig> minutes. counterstaining with hematoxylin was performed and sections were dehydrated and mounted for microscopic examination. negative control staining was performed by the same procedure except that the primary antibodies were replaced by buffer. for t and b lymphocyte counting, ten random fields at 400x total magnification were taken from each slide stained for cd <dig> and cd <dig> respectively. cells were counted in the dermal area adjacent to the epidermis.

rna extraction, cdna synthesis and quantitative real-time pcr
rna extraction, cdna synthesis, and quantitative real-time pcr  were performed as described in mihi et al.  <cit> . briefly, trizol  was used to extract the total rna from the homogenized frozen tissue samples. total rna was purified using the rneasy mini kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. thereafter, genomic dna  was removed using rnase-free dnase set . genomic dna contamination was checked using intron-spanning primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase . finally, one μg of total rna was converted to cdna using the iscript cdna synthesis kit , following the manufacturer’s instructions.

quantitative real-time pcr  was performed to detect the gene expression for the following genes: chemokine receptor- <dig> ; interleukin-1β ; interleukin- <dig> ; interleukin- <dig> ; interleukin- <dig> ; interleukin- <dig> ; interleukin- <dig> ; interleukin- <dig> ; interleukin- <dig> ; interferon γ ; transforming growth factor beta ; tumor necrosis factor alpha ; and ribosomal protein large po . the primers used in the pcr work were designed using the primer <dig> software  and are shown in table  <dig> 

f: forward primer.

r: reverse primer.

amplification reaction was carried out using the steponeplus real-time pcr system  using the sybr green master mix . relative changes in the gene expression of the different tested genes for both the normal and diseased groups were carried out by using the 2-ΔΔct method  <cit> . ct values were transformed into relative quantity  using the delta ct method and q values of the tested genes were normalized against that of a housekeeping gene . normalized q values were used in the statistical analysis.

statistical analysis
data were statistically analyzed using graphpad prism software. the nonparametric mann whitney u test was used to determine variations in the gene expressions between diseased groups versus the normal one. for the histopathological measurements and cell counts, the effect of the clinical stage was investigated using the one way anova test. pair-wise comparisons were made using the tukey's multiple comparisons test. results were formulated as . spearman's rank correlation was used to investigate the relationships between the gene expressions, histopathological measures, and cell counts. in all cases, an associated probability  of <  <dig>  was considered significant.

RESULTS
measurements of total epidermal and keratin layer thickness and rete ridges length
results show that the thickness of the total epidermis and keratin layer, and the length of the rete ridges increased gradually from m <dig> up to m <dig> and subsequently tended to decrease again in the m <dig> stage . small focal ulcerative areas were detected both in m <dig> and m <dig> stages.

significant increases in total epidermal thickness were found in m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> when compared with m <dig> and m <dig>  m <dig> samples, when compared with m <dig> and m <dig>  were characterized by a significant increase in the thickness of the keratin layer. the length of the rete ridges in m <dig> and m <dig> was significantly increased in comparison with m <dig> 

counting immune cells 
hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemically stained sections showed a high number of infiltrating immune cells  in the reticular dermis . numbers of both eosinophils and neutrophils reached a maximum in the m <dig> stage and subsequently decreased in the m <dig> and m <dig> stage. the number of neutrophils measured in the m <dig> stage was significantly higher than in the m <dig> stage. high numbers of t lymphocytes were counted in all dd stages including m <dig> without any significant difference between the different stages. the number of b-lymphocytes was highest in the m <dig> stage although differences found between the different m stages were not significant.

quantitative real-time pcr
the gene expression of  <dig> cytokines, one chemokine, and one chemokine receptor was measured by quantitative real-time pcr  both in the normal as well as in the diseased groups and the results are shown in table  <dig>  cytokines included in the analysis were classified into pro-inflammatory cytokines , th <dig> type cytokines , th <dig> type cytokines , t regulatory cytokines  and th <dig> type cytokine . besides, a chemokine receptor- <dig>  and proinflammatory chemokine  were also analyzed.

il1b and il <dig> transcription levels were observed to increase, reaching a peak at the m <dig> stage, without significant differences between the other disease stages. moreover, a highly significant increase in the transcriptional level for il <dig> was observed, with significant increases of  <dig> and  <dig> fold at the m <dig> and m <dig> stages, respectively. on the other hand, the expression levels for il <dig>  il <dig>  and tnf-α did not seem to be affected.

the transcriptional levels for il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  and ccr <dig> were down-regulated in the diseased versus the control group. the same was true for the transcriptional level of tgf-β, while ifn-γ was not detectable by qrt-pcr.

immunohistochemical staining for il8
the highly significant increase in the transcriptional level for il <dig> in samples of both m <dig> and m <dig> lesions motivated us to examine which cell types were responsible for this increase. immunohistochemical  stainings revealed that the viable keratinocytes located in the epidermis and not the cells located in the stratum corneum or dermal cells were the source of the elevated il <dig> levels .

discussion
the present manuscript describes a study performed to further unravel the pathogenesis of dd in the bovine by examining the inflammatory pattern and the host response in the typical skin lesions that are associated with this painful disease.

on the he stained sections, small ulcers in between the hypertrophied epidermis areas were detected in both m <dig> and m <dig>  but not in the other stages. coupled with the admittedly limited examination of immune cells, these data suggest that blood cells ooze out of the surface via these ulcers, either or not precipitating on the surface, giving rise to the clinical picture of a completely ulcerated lesion, or a lesion covered with a scab, as is the case in m <dig> according to döpfer  <cit> . this suggestion would be consistent with gomez et al.  <cit>  as they stipulated the existence of either exposure of the stratum spinosum or ulceration of the dermis in lesions referred to as typical dd lesions. also, previous studies have shown either a total loss of the epidermis with complete ulceration in severe cases  <cit> , or no ulcerations but only partial loss of the epithelium in m <dig> and complete loss of the stratum corneum in m <dig> lesions  <cit> .

immunohistochemistry also indicated a trend in t and b cell lymphocyte distribution with the former appearing highest in normal skin and the latter in the most chronic dd stage, but this finding warrants further study. in accordance with previous studies  <cit> , we found hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis of the epidermal and keratin layers and elongation of the rete ridges occurred in all diseased groups when compared with the healthy m <dig> samples. these findings can be attributed to a higher proliferation rate of the keratinocytes due to the acute inflammatory reaction of the skin, without a concomitant increase in differentiation and desquamation. the latter causes the epidermis in the m <dig> stage to be significantly increased in thickness in comparison with the m <dig> and m <dig> stages. also the healing stage  has a significantly thicker keratin layer in comparison to the m <dig> and m <dig> stages. the latter can be attributed to the formation of a firm scab during the healing process which makes the keratin layer thicker in comparison to other dd stages  <cit> .

infiltration of different immune cells, mainly neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes was found in the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin. this observation agrees with previous work  <cit> . the m <dig> stage was characterized by the highest increase in the number of infiltrating neutrophils and eosinophils. interestingly, some skin diseases in humans, such as psoriasis, in which the immune reaction of the host is known to play a decisive role in the pathogenesis, are also characterized by a hyperplasia of the epidermis with the infiltration of different immune cells, mainly t lymphocytes and neutrophils  <cit> .

the study showed for the first time a strong transcriptional upregulation of il <dig> in the m <dig> and m <dig> stage, identifying keratinocytes as the source of this increased il <dig> level.

this chemokine il <dig> is known to be produced early in the inflammatory response and has a key role in the recruitment and activity of neutrophils  <cit> . il <dig> is also known to have a stimulatory effect on the migration  <cit>  and proliferation  <cit>  of keratinocytes, which may explain the hyperplasia and thickening of the epidermal layer of the skin. the massive increase of il <dig> is considered to be due not only to increased numbers of producing cells, but also to an upregulation of the expression. previous work on psoriatic patients demonstrated that an elevated il <dig> expression plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of this human skin disease  <cit> . currently, the role of il <dig> in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases in the bovine is receiving considerable attention, since both the existence of divergent il <dig> promoter heliotypes  <cit>  as well as polymorphisms of its receptors  <cit>  have recently been demonstrated. this has been shown to significantly influence the susceptibility to infectious disease and the pattern of the concomitant inflammation reaction and clearly also deserves attention in dd.

CONCLUSIONS
main finding of the present histopathologic study of the different clinical stages  of dd in cattle, was the epidermal hyperplasia being present in all clinical stages. concomitantly with this hyperplasia, there was a massive upregulation of the expression of il <dig> in the keratinocytes which was remarkably obvious in the m <dig> and m <dig> clinical stages. the latter points to a strong stimulation of the innate immune response throughout most of the clinical stages and a delayed response of the adaptive immune reaction. based on similarities with human skin diseases, we think that this finding may contribute to the full elucidation of the pathogenesis of this widespread disease and open the way to new treatment options.
