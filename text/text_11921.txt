BACKGROUND
burkholderia mallei is an obligate parasite of horses, mules and donkeys and no other natural reservoir is known  <cit> . the organism is a nonmotile gram-negative bacillus that is closely related to burkholderia pseudomallei and burkholderia thailandensis. b. pseudomallei is a pathogenic microbe that causes the glanders-like disease melioidosis  <cit>  and b. thailandensis is a weakly pathogenic soil saprophyte  <cit> . while a handful of burkholderia virulence determinants have been identified using rodent models of infection  <cit> , research on the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis is still a fertile area. b. malleib. pseudomallei, and b. thailandensis are able to survive and replicate inside phagocytic cells in a process that involves escape from the endocytic vacuole, replication in the cytosol, intra- and intercellular spread by actin polymerization, and fusion with uninfected cells to form multinucleated giant cells   <cit> . gram-negative pathogens often use secretion systems to deliver virulence factors to the cytosol of host cells, where they modulate cell physiology to favor the microbe. the exploitation of host phagocytic cells by b. pseudomallei involves two type iii secretion systems   <cit> , a type v secretion system   <cit> , and the cluster  <dig> type vi secretion system   <cit> . t6ss- <dig>  occasionally referred to as tss- <dig> <cit> , is also important for host cell interactions and virulence in b. mallei and b. thailandensis <cit> .

small mammal models of infection have long been employed to characterize virulence factors of bacterial pathogens, but over the last decade there has been an increase in the use of surrogate hosts to study the pathogenic mechanisms of bacteria  <cit> . several surrogate hosts have been used as alternatives to mammals to study virulence factors and host-pathogen interactions with b. pseudomalleib. mallei, and b. thailandensis, including galleria mellonella larvae   <cit> , dictyostelium discoideum   <cit> , caenorhabditis elegans   <cit> , and solanum lycopersicum   <cit> . these alternative hosts have allowed the identification of new burkholderia virulence determinants and have confirmed the importance of virulence factors previously characterized using rodent models of infection.

insects are popular alternatives to mammalian hosts in large-scale screening studies, owing largely to the high degree of similarity between the innate immune systems of insects and mammals  <cit> . in both, the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns  by toll receptors  and toll-like receptors  results in the production of antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . furthermore, insect hemocytes and mammalian neutrophils can both engulf and kill most invading microorganisms  <cit> . insects are also afforded protection from microorganisms through the coagulation and melanization of hemolymph, but they do not have an adaptive immune system.

in addition to biological similarities, several logistical issues contribute to the recent adoption of insects as alternative hosts for bacterial pathogens. insects can be readily obtained, housed, and cared for at considerable cost savings compared to mammals. moreover, the use of insects is not governed by animal use regulations or committees and even very large-scale experiments using insects are considered ethically acceptable. as a possible insect alternative to mammalian models of infection, we tested several b. pseudomallei, b. mallei, and b. thailandensis strains against juvenile madagascar hissing cockroaches  obtained from a commercial vendor . mh cockroaches are readily available, easily cultured, and reproduce rapidly. they are larger than wax moth larvae, slow moving compared to other species of cockroaches, and have a substantive carapace. these characteristics make them easier to manipulate and inoculate with known numbers of bacteria compared with other species of insects commonly used for similar studies. mh cockroaches thrive at 37°c, a characteristic that is essential for the analysis of mammalian pathogens.

in this study, we found the mh cockroach to be a suitable surrogate host for b. pseudomallei, b. mallei, and b. thailandensis. burkholderia type vi secretion system mutants were attenuated in mh cockroaches, which is consistent with what is seen in rodent models of infection  <cit> . b. pseudomallei multiplied inside mh cockroach hemocytes and may be the primary mechanism by which this pathogen avoids elimination by the mh cockroach innate immune system. the results suggest that mh cockroaches are a good alternative to mammals for the study of burkholderia species and possibly other mammalian pathogens.

RESULTS
b. pseudomallei is virulent in the mh cockroach and t6ss- <dig> mutants exhibit attenuated virulence
in an attempt to determine if the mh cockroach might serve as a surrogate host for b. pseudomallei, we challenged juvenile mh cockroaches  with k <dig> and t6ss mutant derivatives. t6ss- <dig> is a critical virulence determinant for b. pseudomallei in the hamster model of infection  <cit> , while t6ss- <dig>  t6ss- <dig>  t6ss- <dig>  t6ss- <dig>  and t6ss- <dig> are dispensable for virulence in hamsters. groups of eight mh cockroaches were challenged by the intra-abdominal route with 101- <dig> bacteria and deaths were recorded for 5 days at 37°c .

a ld <dig>  50% lethal dose  <cit> ; b nd, not determined.

b. pseudomallei Δvgrg15’ and Δvgrg13’ are k <dig> derivatives that have deletions within the gene encoding the tail spike protein  of the t6ss- <dig> structural apparatus  <cit> . these mutants were more virulent than b. pseudomallei Δhcp <dig> in the hamster model of infection  <cit> , but were less virulent than k <dig> . there was no difference in the ld <dig> of Δvgrg15’Δvgrg13’, and k <dig> in mh cockroaches , however, there was a slight but not statistically significant difference in the time to death with these strains. in general, it took longer for mh cockroaches infected with Δvgrg15’ and Δvgrg13’ to die relative to k <dig> . thus, these strains appear to have an intermediate virulence phenotype in both mh cockroaches and in hamsters .

we next examined the relative virulence of the b. pseudomallei Δhcp <dig>  Δhcp <dig>  Δhcp <dig>  Δhcp <dig>  and Δhcp <dig> mutants in mh cockroaches  <cit> . these mutants are each deficient in one of the other five t6sss present in b. pseudomallei and all are virulent in the hamster . figure  <dig> shows that these strains are also virulent in the mh cockroach and all exhibit a clear dose response. the majority of mh cockroaches infected with a challenge dose of  <dig> bacteria were dead by day  <dig> , but most were dead by day  <dig> with a challenge dose of  <dig> bacteria . interestingly, the ld <dig> results with these strains are remarkably similar in both mh cockroaches and hamsters .

the virulence of two additional isolates of b. pseudomallei and two isolates of escherichia coli were also tested in the mh cockroach. the ld50s of b. pseudomallei 1026b and mshr <dig> were < <dig> bacteria and the ld50s for e. coli mc <dig> and b/r were > <dig> bacteria, the highest dose tested . the results suggest that virulence for the mh cockroach is common among b. pseudomallei isolates and that not all gram-negative bacteria are pathogenic for this surrogate host .

taken together, the results demonstrate that b. pseudomallei is highly virulent in the mh cockroach and indicate that this insect might serve as a surrogate host for high throughput virulence screening assays. in addition, the mh cockroach challenge results are consistent with what is seen in the hamster model of infection and suggest that the primary function of the t6ss- <dig> is to evade the innate immune system.

the mh cockroach can serve as a surrogate host for b. mallei and b. thailandensis
we also evaluated the virulence of b. mallei and b. thailandensis in the mh cockroach. the ld50s for b. mallei sr <dig>  and b. thailandensis dw <dig>  were <  <dig> bacteria  and the number and rate of deaths increased as the challenge dose increased from  <dig> to  <dig> bacteria . interestingly, b. mallei killed the mh cockroaches at a slower rate than b. thailandensis . it took only 2 days for b. thailandensis to kill 75% of the mh cockroaches with a dose of  <dig> bacteria, whereas it took b. mallei 5 days . similar trends were apparent with challenge doses of  <dig> and  <dig> bacteria . b. mallei does not kill rodents as quickly as b. pseudomallei and it is more fastidious than b. pseudomallei and b. thailandensis, so it may not be too surprising that it took longer to kill mh cockroaches  <cit> . these experiments demonstrate that b. mallei and b. thailandensis are both virulent in the mh cockroach and suggest that the mh cockroach might serve as a surrogate host for these bacterial species.

as mentioned above, b. thailandensis is considered to be avirulent in humans and exhibits a higher ld <dig> in mammalian models of infection than b. mallei and b. pseudomallei. mammals, unlike mh cockroaches, possess both an innate and an acquired immune system. the fact that b. thailandensis is highly virulent in the mh cockroach may suggest that the acquired immune system plays an important role in defence against b. thailandensis. b. mallei and b. pseudomallei, on the other hand, may have developed mechanisms to subvert the acquired immune response in mammalian species.

t6ss- <dig> is a critical virulence determinant for b. mallei in the hamster model of infection  <cit>  and for b. thailandensis in the c57bl/ <dig> mouse model of infection  <cit> . we challenged mh cockroaches with b. mallei and b. thailandensis hcp <dig> mutants and found that they were highly attenuated in this surrogate host . the ld50s for b. mallei Δhcp <dig> and b. thailandensis hcp1- were >  <dig> bacteria on day  <dig>  which was at least  <dig> times higher than their respective parental strains . the b. mallei results were indistinguishable from what was previously described for sr <dig> and Δhcp <dig> using the hamster model of infection  <cit> . while the b. thailandensis strains used in this study have not been tested in hamsters, a b. thailandensis t6ss- <dig> mutant was recently shown to be avirulent in c57bl/ <dig> mice by the aerosol route of infection  <cit> . interestingly, myd88−/− mice were susceptible to the b. thailandensis t6ss- <dig> mutant, which suggests that t6ss- <dig> plays a role in evading the innate immune response  <cit> . the fact that b. thailandensis hcp1- was attenuated in an insect host, which lacks an adaptive immune response, further supports the notion that the function of the t6ss- <dig> is to evade the eukaryotic innate immune system.

b. pseudomallei replicates inside mh cockroach hemocytes
hemocytes are a key component of the mh cockroach innate immune system and we next examined if b. pseudomallei might be exploiting these phagocytic cells to gain an upper hand in the host-pathogen interaction. a group of eight mh cockroaches were infected with ~ 103b. pseudomallei k <dig> and closely monitored for 48 h. mh cockroaches that appeared weak and lethargic were immediately separated from the others and hemolymph was obtained. the mh cockroach hemolymph, which contains phagocytic hemocytes, was fixed and stained with dapi. figure 5a shows a representative field containing the blue-staining nuclei from multiple hemocytes. as expected, the non-nuclear regions of most hemocytes could not be visualized with this fluorescent dna stain. interestingly, each field also contained one or two hemocytes in which the nucleus and the surrounding cytosol could be easily visualized . we speculated that these particular hematocytes might contain cytosolic b. pseudomallei and we stained the hemolymph with a polyclonal antibody that reacts with b. pseudomallei. figure 5b and 5 c show a representative micrograph of a hematocyte engorged with cytosolic b. pseudomallei, suggesting that the bacteria are multiplying to high numbers inside these cells. free bacteria can also be visualized in the hemolymph outside the hemocyte, but it is unclear if these cells are alive or dead . some infected hemocytes appear to have multiple nuclei and may be multinucleated giant cells  . mngc have been observed in cases of human melioidosis  <cit>  and are often formed when b.pseudomallei infects murine macrophage-like cell lines in vitro  <cit> . the formation of b. pseudomallei-induced mngcs in vivo in mh cockroaches is an exciting finding and indicates that mngcs can form in non-adherent cells freely flowing within the hemolymph.

based on these results, we hypothesize that b. pseudomallei is able to survive the innate immune system of the mh cockroach by establishing an intracellular niche within the hemocyte. infected hemocytes harboring numerous cytosolic bacteria may fuse with uninfected hemocytes to form mngcs, which may serve as a reservoir for continued bacterial replication and protection from the antimicrobial peptides present in the surrounding hemolymph. the amplification of bacteria within phagocytic hemocytes, and their subsequent release, may eventually overwhelm the mh cockroach and lead to death.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that the madagascar hissing cockroach can serve as a surrogate host for the analysis of host-pathogen interactions with b. pseudomallei, b. mallei, and b. thailandensis. using this system, we were able to detect virulence differences between parental strains and t6ss- <dig> mutants that were consistent with what was seen in rodent models of infection. b. pseudomallei k <dig> demonstrated the ability to multiply inside insect hemocytes and form mngcs, which may be the primary mechanism by which it avoids killing by the mh cockroach innate immune system. the mh cockroach will probably be useful for high throughput virulence screening assays with these burkholderia species as well as other bacterial pathogens.
