BACKGROUND
embryo implantation is a necessary stage in fetal development: in order to gain access to nutrients and gas exchange, the embryo attaches to the uterine epithelium and invades into the endometrium. it is a multi-step process that consists of: the hatching of the blastocyst from the zona pellucida, adhesion of the blastocyst to the uterine epithelium, stromal invasion and reorganization. this process is orchestrated through the coordinated, reciprocal interaction between the embryo and uterus and is mediated via a variety of molecules including steroid hormones, cytokines, adhesion molecules, proteinases and their inhibitors  <cit> .

proteinases of different classes have been hypothesized to give the blastocyst its invasive character and/or participate in the remodelling of the uterine stroma. alfonso et al  <cit>  have reported that cysteine proteinases play a critical role in implantation, and there have been several reports implicating matrix metalloproteinases  in this process  <cit> . different serine proteinases are also known to be expressed in a finely regulated pattern during implantation, including urokinase-type plasminogen activator  and proprotein convertase spc5/ <dig>  <cit> . however, the targeted disruption of several murine proteinase genes, presumed essential for implantation, has indicated that many are dispensable, suggesting that other distinct proteinases may be involved  <cit> .

in order to discover additional serine proteinases with potential involvement in implantation, we identified two novel implantation serine proteinase genes . these were found to be co-expressed in mouse uterine endometrium throughout the peri-implantation period and tandemly organized within a bed of tryptase genes on mouse chromosome 17a <dig>   <cit> . isp <dig> gene expression was first detected in pre-implantation embryos  <cit> . antisense disruption of isp <dig> gene expression prevented embryo hatching and outgrowth in vitro  <cit> . both isp <dig> and  <dig> gene expression was also detected in the uterine endometrial gland, under the positive influence of progesterone  <cit> . using immunoblotting, both isp proteins were detected in the uterine fluid on day  <dig> of pregnancy, just prior to the commencement of implantation  <cit> . this appearance of protein in the glands and uterine fluid seems to be negatively regulated by estrogen, such that both isp proteins appear in the uterine fluid shortly after the estrogen spike synchronizes uterine-embryo receptivity and the commencement of implantation  <cit> . interestingly, antibodies directed against isp <dig> protein have recently been found to abrogate implantation, suggesting an important role for the isps in implantation  <cit> .

mast cell tryptases are known to exist in multimeric form  <cit> . since the isps are co-expressed in endometrial glands, we previously hypothesized that they exist as hetero-tetramers, a theory that was supported by protein modelling studies  <cit> . in this study, we have purified a heterodimeric  <dig> kd isp enzyme complex from day four pregnant mouse uterus, which is comprised of isp <dig>  and isp <dig>  monomers. the same enzyme complex was detected in uterine fluid and pre-implantation embryos. enzyme kinetic studies have demonstrated the affiliation of isp enzyme complex with s <dig> proteinases, having trypsin-like substrate specificity. immunohistochemistry suggests the isp enzyme complex localizes to the site of embryo invasion during implantation. gabexate mesylate, a potent tryptase inhibitor, was found to inhibit isp activity, and arrest hatching and outgrowth of embryos in vitro, and implantation in utero. these results demonstrate that isp enzyme complex plays a critical role in initiating murine implantation.

RESULTS
characterization and purification of the isp1-isp <dig> enzyme complex
we have characterized the expression of the isps in uterine tissue, uterine fluid and blastocysts. uterine tissue homogenate and intra-uterine fluid from cd <dig> mice at the peri-implantation period were probed for the presence of isps using mabs . under denaturing conditions, monomers of both isp <dig>  and isp <dig>  proteins were found in highly enriched uterine tissue homogenates and uterine fluid. in addition to the monomers, an upper band , presumably a complex of isp <dig> and isp <dig> was also obtained when either anti-isp <dig> or anti-isp <dig> mab were used to probe . this  <dig> kd band exhibits proteolytic activity in gel when n-benzoyl arginine p-nitroanilide  is used as a substrate . the other two bands obtained  were identified as igg light  and heavy  chains by mass spectrometry analysis. the existence of iggs in the uterine tissue homogenates and uterine fluid can be explained by the vascular nature of pre-implantation uteri, such that blood serum products are found in high abundance. a similar enzyme complex was also detected in mouse blastocysts in western blots using denaturing conditions . as we had previously not detected isp <dig> expression in the embryo, we used rt-pcr to confirm that isp <dig> was indeed expressed in the preimplantation embryo . following upon our previous observation of isp <dig> and isp <dig> co-expression in uterine glands  <cit>  and now embryos , as well as this higher molecular weight complex in the gels, we used co-immunopreciptation to investigate the possibility that isp monomers formed hetero-dimeric complexes. co-ips were performed by cross-linking anti-isp mabs to activated agarose beads followed by affinity purification of the respective proteins from the uterine tissue homogenates. the bound antibodies were able to precipitate their cognate protein targets , as well as their corresponding opposite isp . these results lend credence to the idea that isp <dig> and isp <dig> hetero-dimerize to form a higher molecular weight enzyme.

enzyme kinetics
to determine the substrate specificity of the isp complex and to classify it into a subclass of the s <dig> family of serine proteinases, enzyme assays were carried out using different p-nitroanilide linked peptide  substrates. these included chymotrypsin-like  site), trypsin-like , elastase-like , and subtilisin-like  substrates. the results obtained are shown in figure 4a. in order to compare affinity of specific substrates and derive michaelis menton constant  values, the kinetic curves were plotted . a trypsin-specific substrate, n-benzoyl phe-val-arg p-nitroanilide, showed the best affinity towards the isp enzyme complex.

many general serine proteinase inhibitors were tested in order to identify suitable isp inhibitors when bapna was used as a substrate. these included benzamidine hydrochloride, 4--methane-sulfonyl fluoride , l- <dig> chloro-3- -7-amino-2-heptanone. hcl , trypsin soybean inhibitor , bis  methane , gabexate mesylate, nafamostat, and the kunitz family serpins uterine plasmin-trypsin inhibitor  and secretary leukocyte proteinase inhibitor .

only inhibitors specific for trypsin-like serine proteinases were able to inhibit the isps . ic <dig>  values were obtained by plotting inhibition data, which were extrapolated into cheng and prusoff's  <cit>  equation to derive the dissociation constant .

uterine horns of  <dig>  dpc pregnant dams were injected with  <dig> ul each of saline  or the gabexate mesylate . animals were sacrificed and examined for pregnancies at  <dig>  dpc. % rate of pregnancy was calculated by assuming the rate of pregnancy in controls as 100%.

hatching and implantation studies
previously we have determined that both embryo hatching and outgrowth in vitro were inhibited by antisense oligonucleotides, which abrogated isp <dig> gene expression  <cit> . in further immunohistochemistry experiments, we have determined that both isp <dig> and isp <dig> localize to the embryo-uterine boundary during implantation .

in order to define a physiological role for the isps, the effect of inhibiting isp activity upon embryo hatching, outgrowth  and implantation  was investigated. blastocysts were first cultured in the presence or absence of anti-isp mabs or selected inhibitors. different concentrations of anti-isp antibodies and inhibitors  were tried in order to eliminate their toxic concentrations from influencing results . figure 7a demonstrates the effect of two different concentrations of gabexate on the hatching of blastocysts in comparison to controls. here, an incremental decrease in the rate of hatching is noticeable with increasing gabexate concentration. although kinetic studies showed that babim was a more effective inhibitor  than gabexate , limited quantities of this inhibitor prevented a significant in vitro hatching/outgrowth analysis. similarly, the effect of varying concentrations of anti-isp <dig> and anti-isp <dig> mabs was studied both individually and together . the results obtained clearly show that anti-isp mabs can efficiently arrest blastocyst hatching compared to controls .

implantation was simulated in vitro by growth of the hatched blastocysts in culture plates coated with the extracellular matrix derived from mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which can be invaded by outgrowing embryos . different concentrations of anti-isp antibodies and gabexate were tried as shown in figures 7b, d, f and 7h. the effect of gabexate on blastocyst outgrowth is also incremental with increasing concentration of gabexate . individually, anti-isp <dig> and anti-isp <dig> mabs did not seem to have a significant effect on embryo outgrowth . however, when administered together, anti-isp antibodies led to an arrest/delay in embryo outgrowth . gabexate also had a significant effect on embryo implantation in vivo. when administered topically to the uterus by injecting into the lumen at  <dig>  dpc, the rate of pregnancy drops to very low in comparison to controls . a similar result was not observed for individual or combined mabs, possibly owing to the abundance of isp enzyme that occurs within the uterine fluid.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we have previously demonstrated that the isps are tandemly linked genes, which are co-regulated in the uterine endometrial gland during the peri-implantation period  <cit> . isp gene expression leads to the secretion of both isp <dig> and isp <dig> into uterine fluid at the time of hatching and initiation of implantation  <cit> . in this report, we show that the isps are also co-expressed in pre-implantation embryos, consistent with the idea that they may also be co-regulated in the pre-implantation embryo. these observations are consistent with our observation that isp <dig> and isp <dig> form a hetero-dimeric complex. upon purification of isp enzyme complex from pregnant uterus and confirmation by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry, we determined its molecular weight to be ~ <dig> kd, with the isp <dig> and isp <dig> monomers being ~ <dig> and  <dig> kd, respectively. these molecular weights are consistent with our previous study, where we characterized the appearance of isp monomers in uterine fluid during the peri-implantation period  <cit> . however, our results contradict a previous report of isp <dig> as having a molecular weight of  <dig> kd  <cit> .

we have suggested that the isps are members of the mast cell tryptase family  <cit>  and have demonstrated that the isp genes reside in a tryptase cluster on mouse chromosome 17a <dig>   <cit> . in this study we have used synthetic substrates to classify isp enzyme complex based on its enzymatic activity. consistent with our previous suggestions, we have sub-classified isp enzyme complex as being trypsin-like since; it does not show any reactivity with synthetic serine proteinase substrates specific for chymotrypsin, subtilisin or elastase. hence, isp enzyme can only cleave peptides that contain arginine or lysine at the p <dig> position, with arginine being the preferred choice. amongst the substrates tested, bpvana has the highest affinity towards the enzyme  demonstrating preference of a tripeptide having valine at p <dig> position and phenylalanine at p <dig> position over the other peptide substrates. currently, work is in progress to further define the substrate preferences of isp using phage display peptide mimetics.

the isp genes are most closely related to their neighbours mmcp <dig> and  <dig>  which have previously been shown to exist as homo-tetrameric enzymes  <cit> . based on previous in silico molecular modelling, we have postulated that isp <dig> and isp <dig> exist as hetero-tetramers  <cit> . following on our finding that the isps do not seem to tetramerize in vitro, we have examined the properties of tryptases, which promote tetramer formation. although the isps possess the hydrophobic domain containing eight trp residues important for tetramer formation  <cit> , they lack two of the three surface-exposed his residues that are necessary for mmcp <dig> tetramerization  <cit> . interestingly, in this regard, at least one other tryptase in this cluster, tryptase γ, has been speculated to form only dimers  <cit> . although we demonstrate at this time that isp <dig> and isp <dig> form heterodimers, we do not know if this is exclusive, or whether the isps can also homodimerize. our observation that isp <dig> and isp <dig> mabs can block embryo hatching and/or outgrowth, only when applied in combination, suggests the possibility that homo-dimers not only exist, but can also function in embryo hatching and invasion.

previously, we have reported that the antisense abrogation of isp <dig> expression in blastocysts resulted in the inhibition of hatching from the zona pellucida and in vitro outgrowth into extracellular matrix  <cit> . we have suggested that embryonic isp enzyme represents the murine hatching enzyme strypsin, which is secreted from blastocysts and predicted to be ~ <dig> kd based on autoradiography  <cit> . in this study, several general trypsin inhibitors including benzamidine, apmsf, tlck, gabexate mesylate, babim and tsi showed an inhibitory influence on isp activity. amongst them tsi exhibited the highest affinity for the isp enzyme complex . our results agree with the previous characterization of stypsin, which demonstrated that trypsin inhibitors had a significant inhibitory effect on blastocyst hatching. like isp, tsi was the strongest inhibitor of strypsin activity. like strypsin, isp demonstrates the highest affinity towards inhibitors of 'trypsin like' activity; and doesn't catalyse the cleavage of chymotrypsin or elastase substrates.

in this study, we have confirmed a role for isp in embryo hatching and outgrowth. when exposed to gabexate mesylate, a synthetic inhibitor of tryptases  <cit>  and isp , both in vitro embryo hatching and outgrowth were almost completely inhibited. similarly, administration of anti-isp <dig> and anti-isp <dig> monoclonal antibodies also led to a delay in hatching and outgrowth in vitro. together these results suggest that isp plays a vital role during embryo implantation, likely at the level of zona pellucida lysis and the initiation of invasion into uterine endometrium.

interestingly, immunohistochemistry of implanting embryos shows that isp enzyme complex surrounds the invading embryo, highlighting their importance in implantation. at this time, it is not clear whether this peri-implantation isp staining is strictly from the embryo or whether isp complex that resides in uterine fluid is also recruited to sites of embryo invasion. however, inhibition of isp activity in vivo via the topical application of gabexate had a significant negative effect on implantation. although we cannot rule out the involvement of other proteinases in the process of hatching and implantation at this time, isp appears to be an essential link in the cascade of events. presently, we are disrupting the isp genes to genetically confirm their role in hatching and implantation. we are also characterizing the substrates and protein targets of isp in order to better understand the process of implantation. this could in turn lead to the design of more specific synthetic inhibitors of isp and the development of new and more potent contraceptives.
