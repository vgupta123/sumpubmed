BACKGROUND
maintenance of proper gene expression in differentiated cells is essential for the development of multicellular organisms and epigenetic regulation is an important player in this process reviewed in:  <cit> . one family of proteins with deeply conserved functions in epigenetic regulation is the polycomb group . the pcg was first discovered in drosophila melanogaster as repressors of the hox genes  <cit> . several pcg complexes exist in both plants and animals, each with distinct functions in epigenetic silencing reviewed in:  <cit> . however, only the polycomb repressive complex  <dig>  has been well characterized in multiple plant models reviewed in:  <cit> . the main function of the prc <dig> complex is trimethylation of lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig> , a histone modification known to suppress gene expression  <cit> . the prc <dig> contains four core proteins; the histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste ), and three other proteins thought to enhance prc <dig> binding to nucleosome  <cit> . these include suppressor of zeste  <dig> 12) and extra sex combs , known respectively as embryonic flower  <dig>  and fertilization independent endosperm  in plants, and multi-copy suppressor of ira  <dig>  reviewed in:  <cit> . the e lineage in plants has experienced an ancient duplication such that most angiosperms have at least two paralogs, known as curly leaf  and swinger   <cit> . many plant species have additional duplications in the core prc <dig> loci that allow them to form several prc <dig> complexes often with distinct developmental functions  <cit> .

prc <dig> is involved in a number of important developmental transitions. in the plant model system a. thaliana, these functions include endosperm development, early repression of flowering to allow proper vegetative development, the eventual transition to flowering, and flower organogenesis  <cit> . in grasses, the prc <dig> complex plays roles in floral induction , flower development , suppressing cell divisions in the unfertilized ovule , and endosperm development   <cit> . in the moss model physcomitrella patens, prc2-dependent remodeling appear to be required for the switch from gametophyte to sporophyte development  <cit> .

in addition to its role in developmental transitions, prc <dig> has been suggested to function in lateral organ development in a. thaliana. in fact, the first description of a plant prc <dig> function was discovered with the characterization of the clf mutant in a. thaliana <cit> . the clf plants had severely curled leaves, smaller narrower sepals and petals, and partial homeotic transformations of sepals and petals towards carpel and stamen identity, respectively. two mads box genes, the c class member agamous  and the b class representative apetala <dig>  were shown to be over-expressed in clf mutants, suggesting that the prc <dig> complex was required for stable repression of these genes  <cit> . this was particularly interesting because mads box genes regulate homeotic floral organ identity in plants somewhat analogously to the way hox genes regulate segment identity in animals  <cit> . further studies have subsequently shown that the e class mads sepallata <dig>  is similarly up-regulated in clf mutants  <cit> . prc <dig> has also been shown to regulate the expression of the class i knox genes during vegetative development. the class i knox genes are a family of homeobox domain-containing loci in plants that have conserved roles in promoting pluripotency in the shoot apical meristem and in compound leaf development  <cit> . katz et al  <cit>  found that in addition to the phenotypes reported in clf mutant plants, fie cosuppressed plants also had loss of apical dominance and fasciated stems, rolled leaves with varying degrees of serration, loss of phyllotaxy in the inflorescence, and many problems with ovary and ovule development. they further demonstrated that several class i knox genes, including brevipedicellus , knotted-like from arabidopsis thaliana  <dig> , and shootmeristemless , were over-expressed in rosette leaves of fie silenced plants. in clf mutants, stm and knat <dig> were over-expressed but bp was not, possibly because the clf paralog swn was acting redundantly. the class i knox genes moss knotted1-like  <dig> and  <dig>  were also shown to be over-expressed in ppfie mutant gametophytes  <cit> , suggesting that prc <dig> targeting of the class i knox genes may be deeply conserved.

while the functions of the floral abc class and type i knox genes are thought to be conserved across angiosperms, comparative studies of their regulation have largely focused on upstream transcription factors, such as leafy or arp family members  <cit> . in order to begin addressing the question of whether prc2-targeting interactions are similarly conserved, we have examined the functions of prc <dig> members in lateral organ development of the emerging model system aquilegia. the genus aquilegia is a member of an early diverging lineage of the eudicotyledonous flowering plants, the ranunculales, that arose before the radiation of the core eudicots reviewed in:  <cit> . it therefore can be used as a rough phylogenetic midpoint between a. thaliana and model systems in the grasses  <cit> . additionally, many ecological, evolutionary and genetic studies have been conducted in aquilegia over the past 50 years. these have taken advantage of its small genome  as well as a number of more recent genomic tools, including the fully sequenced aquilegia x coerulea genome  reviewed in:  <cit> . the reverse genetic tool virus-induced gene silencing  has been optimized in several species of aquilegia <cit>  for both leaf and floral development  <cit> . previously we examined the evolution and expression of the prc <dig> family in aquilegia <cit>  and found that the genome contains a simple complement of prc <dig> homologs: one copy each of the two plant e homologs, aqclf and aqswn; an esc homolog, aqfie; a su <dig> homolog, aqemf2; and a copy of msi <dig>  aqmsi <dig>  we initially assessed gene expression throughout aquilegia vulgaris development due to its strong vernalization dependency and found no obvious tissue or stage specialization. furthermore, the ancient paralogs, aqclf and aqswn, are not imprinted in aquilegia endosperm as is seen in other plant species  <cit> .

in the current study we have used vigs to knock down the expression of aqfie  and aqemf <dig>  in unvernalized and vernalized aquilegia coerulea ‘origami’ plants using the anthocyanin synthase  as a marker gene. due to limitations of the vigs approach, it is not possible to assess many life cycle transitions, most notably flowering time, but lateral organ development can still serve as a useful model for prc <dig> function. we find that prc <dig> plays a role in leaf and floral organ development in a. x coerulea, particularly via down-regulation of the floral mads box genes. this has allowed us to identify prc <dig> targets that appear to be conserved between arabidopsis and aquilegia as well as some novel prc2-regulated pathways.

methods
virus-induced gene silencing
the aquilegia vigs protocol was preformed as described previously  <cit> . trv2-aqclf-aqans, trv2-aqswn-aqans, trv2-aqfie-aqans and trv2-aqemf2-aqans constructs were prepared by pcr amplifying approximately 300 bp regions of each gene using primers that added ecor <dig> and xbai restriction sites to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the prc products . the pcr products were then purified and cloned into the trv2-aqans construct  <cit>  and electroporated into agrobacterium strain gv <dig>  a. x coerulea seedlings were grown to approximately the  <dig> to  <dig> leaf stage and then either treated as described in gould and kramer  <cit>  for unvernalized samples or as described in sharma and kramer  <cit>  for plants that had been vernalized for approximately 4 weeks at 4°c  <cit> . the trv2-aqans and trv2-aqfie-aqans constructs were each used to treat approximately  <dig> plants over  <dig> rounds of vigs. approximately  <dig> of these plants were vigs treated before vernalization and approximately  <dig> of these plants were treated after vernalization. the trv2-aqemf2-aqans construct was used to treat approximately  <dig> plants; roughly  <dig> of these plants were treated before vernalization and  <dig> were treated after vernalization. leaves, petals, and sepals showing aqans silencing were photographed, collected, and stored at -80°c for rna analysis.

rt-pcr
rna was extracted from control  and experimental  tissue. one half of the aqans silenced  leaves were from separate unvernalized plants  and half were from separate vernalized plants . five of the trv2-aqfie-aqans treated leaves were from separate unvernalized plants  while three were collected from separate vernalized plants . all of the trv2-aqemf2-aqans leaves were collected from separate vernalized plants . sample numbers do not indicate order of leaf appearance but were collected at roughly the same stages of development. we selected a variety of observed phenotypes for each set of samples. for leaves, the rneasy mini kit  was used. for petals and sepals rna was extracted using the pure-link plant rna reagent small scale rna isolation protocol . rna was treated with turbo dnase  and cdna was synthesized from 1 μg of total rna using superscript ii reverse transcriptase  and oligo  primers. cdna was diluted 1: <dig> prior to use.

amplification was performed using accustart pcr supermix . the amplification program began with 1 minute activation step at 94°c, followed by a 20 second denaturing step at 94°c, a 15 second annealing step at 55°c, and a 15 second extension at 72°c, repeated for 30 cycles. this cycle number was chosen for optimal detection of aqfie and aqemf <dig>  which are expressed at relatively low levels in mature organs, especially compared to the high expression levels of aqipp <dig>  all primers used are listed in additional file  <dig>  amplification of isopentyl pyrophosphate:dimethylallyl pyrophosphate isomerase <dig>  was used as a positive control  <cit> . to test for expression of apetala3- <dig> , apetala3- <dig> , apetala3- <dig> , and ful-like-  <dig>  in vigs-treated leaves, cdna from several leaves were pooled together prior to amplification. the control pool consisted of aqans-silenced control leaves c1- <dig>  the aqfie vigs-treated pool consisted of aqfie leaves f3- <dig>  and the aqemf <dig> vigs-treated pool consisted of aqemf <dig> leaves e1- <dig> 

qrt-pcr
cdna was prepared from vigs-treated tissue as described above. for the carpel sample, carpels were collected from  <dig> anthesis stage wild type plants and pooled together. rna was extracted using the rneasy mini kit  and treated as described above. cdna from vigs-treated tissue was then pooled together and diluted 1: <dig>  the control sepal pool consisted of aqans-silenced control sepals c1- <dig>  the control petal pool consisted of aqans-silenced control petals c1- <dig>  the aqfie sepal pool consisted of aqfie vigs-treated sepals f <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the aqfie petal pool consisted of aqfie vigs-treated petals f <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the aqemf <dig> sepal pool consisted of aqemf <dig> vigs-treated sepals e <dig>   <dig>  and 4 s, and the aqemf <dig> petal pool consisted of aqemf <dig> vigs-treated petals e <dig> and e <dig>  qrt-pcr was performed using perfecta qpcr fastmix, low rox  in the stratagene mx3005p qpcr system to study the relative expression of aqag <dig> and aqag <dig>  aqipp <dig> expression was used for value normalization. all primers are listed in additional file  <dig> 

microscopy
petals from wild type, aqans vigs-treated, and aqemf <dig> vigs-treated plants were stored at -80°c and then warmed to room temperature and mounted whole on glass slides in water. cells were visualized in the harvard center for biological imaging on a zeiss axioimager z <dig> microscope using trans-illumination with white light. images were taken using a zeiss axiocam mrc digital camera.

RESULTS
we treated both unvernalized and vernalized plants with trv <dig> constructs containing either aqans-aqfie or aqans-aqemf <dig> fragments. trv2-aqans treated plants were used as controls throughout. phenotypes of aqfie and aqemf <dig> silenced plants were equivalent and will be discussed together. we also treated a small number of unvernalized plants with aqans-aqclf and aqans-aqswn vigs constructs. phenotypes from these plants were similar to those seen in aqfie and aqemf <dig>  but were weaker , most likely due to partial redundancy between aqclf and aqswn. thus we chose to focus on aqfie and aqemf <dig> vigs-treated tissue. as is common for vigs-treated plants, we recovered a range of phenotypes in a small percentage of vigs-treated plants   <cit> . in the current experiment there is the added component that phenotypes are likely due to mis-expression of prc <dig> target genes, and are therefore likely to have an added complexity due to ectopic expression of a potentially wide range of target loci.

vegetative phenotypes
wild type aquilegia leaves are compound, typically bearing three leaflets that are themselves divided into two to three lobes . although these leaflets are often relatively deeply lobed, they do not generally produce elongated, higher order petiolules within the leaflets. however, a. x coerulea does display heteroblasty over the course of its lifespan, varying leaf morphology as the individual progresses from the vegetative to the reproductive stage . in late reproductive adult stages, higher order petiolules may be observed in which the central lobe of each leaflet becomes itself a separate leaflet borne its own petiolule . using the terminology of kim et al.  <dig>  <cit> , all of these leaf forms are non-peltately palmate in that the leaflets are not radially positioned around the terminus of the primary petiole.

we observed aqans silencing in 10-15% of treated plants across the aqfie- and aqemf2-vigs experiments. in addition to the aqans-silencing, the leaves of these plants showed a complex set of phenotypes. the most consistently observed perturbation was curled or ruffled laminae that typically curled toward the abaxial surface  . we also observed an increased frequency of higher order branching in which fully formed petiolules developed within the leaflet, creating as many as ten or twelve distinct leaflets rather than the usual three . while we have never observed such higher order branching in control leaves, either in the context of these experiments or others  <cit> , we obtained  <dig> leaves from a total of  <dig> aqfie- and aqemf2-treated plants that exhibited increased branching. when quantified , the presence of higher order petiolules is significant at p <  <dig>  for unvernalized lateral leaflets but not significant for the other stages/leaflet types. however, it is obvious that there is much more branching variation in silenced leaflets than in controls. in many cases, the margins of the laminae had additional lobing relative to control leaves   and, in a small number of cases, the central lobe of the terminal leaflet was severely reduced  . laminar area was highly variable with some leaflets appearing to have expanded area   while others seemed reduced  . in two plants, ectopic finger-like projections were observed on the adaxial surface of laminae , which was never observed in control leaflets.

floral phenotypes
wild type a. x coerulea flowers possess five organ types: sepals, petals, stamens, staminodia and carpels  <cit> . we have focused on the sepals and petals because they showed strong phenotypes in the silenced flowers. wild type sepals are flat and ovate with an entire margin . the petals are notable for the presence of a long hollow nectar spur, which forms near the attachment point . this feature divides the organ into two regions, the proximal spur and the distal limb. spurs in a. x coerulea are typically 5-6 cm in length and slightly curved. the limb region is relatively flat with a rounded, weakly lobed margin . in  <dig> flowers from vernalized aqfie- and aqemf2-treated plants, we observed sepals that were narrower than wildtype organs and dramatically folded towards the adaxial surface . in severely affected flowers, petals were narrowed and stunted  or exhibited sharply bent spurs . in two aqemf2-silenced flowers, the sepals exhibited chimeric petal identity including ectopic spur formation . perhaps most surprising, many of the perianth organs had a definite yellow hue, with the petal limbs showing particularly intense yellow coloration  . such coloration was not observed in aqans-silenced control flowers . examination of the aqfie- and aqemf2-silenced organs under high magnification reveals that yellow pigment is deposited in plastids , consistent with carotenoids rather than the vacuole-based aurones that are produced in some aquilegia species  <cit> .

assessment of aqfie and aqemf <dig> down-regulation
due to limited rna availability, we used standard rt-pcr to assess target gene down-regulation in leaves, sepals and petals compared to their expression in aqans silenced control tissue. even in aqans silenced  tissue, aqfie and aqemf <dig> are expressed at low levels relative to the loading control aqipp <dig>  the experimental samples  were selected to represent all of the observed phenotypes and were derived from separate plants. this analysis demonstrated that in the trv2-aqfie-aqans treated plants, aqfie was strongly down-regulated, being undetectable in a number of samples . likewise, aqemf <dig> expression is reduced to undetectable levels in most tested aqemf2-silenced samples . we also tested for aqemf <dig> in aqfie-treated plants and vice versa, and found that aqemf <dig> levels are often reduced in aqfie-treated leaves, although the reciprocal is generally not true . furthermore, we tested the other prc2-complex members, aqclf and aqswn, and found no consistent evidence of their down-regulation in either type of silenced tissue .

assessment of candidate gene expression
we tested for ectopic expression of a wide panel of potential target genes, with a focus on the floral organ identity loci and type i knox homologs . we again compared the expression of these genes to expression in aqans-silenced control tissue. one of the two a. x coerulea the c class mads box genes, agamous  <dig>  , is consistently up-regulated in silenced leaves and floral organs. the second agamous homologs, agamous <dig>  may also be slightly up-regulated in some of the leaves, although aqag <dig> shows basal expression in control floral organs . the three a. x coerulea sepallata paralogs  are somewhat difficult to assess because they are variably expressed in control leaves but aqsep <dig> in particular seems to be up-regulated in aqemf2-silenced leaves . these genes were not assessed in floral organs because they are already broadly expressed in these tissues. a. x coerulea also has three paralogs of the b class mads box gene, apetala <dig> . the petal-specific aqap3- <dig> locus is highly up-regulated in aqemf2-silenced sepals, which also showed chimeric sepal/petal identity in several cases . additionally two of the three ap <dig> paralogs are moderately up-regulated in prc <dig> vigs-treated leaves , but the expression of aqap3- <dig> and aqap3- <dig> is unaffected in mature sepals and petals . we also looked at the expression of ful-like  <dig> , which is normally expressed in early leaves, but no ectopic expression was detected .

next, we tested for up-regulation of three of the five a. x coerulea class i knox genes. no significant ectopic knox gene expression could be detected in the leaves. weak expression of the shootmeristemless  <dig>  and knotted  homologs is detected in aqemf2-silenced leaves , however, we also occasionally detected comparable expression of these genes in control  leaves, so it is difficult to ascribe significance to this expression. given the lack of clear up-regulation in leaves and due to a limited amount of floral rna, class i knox gene expression was not tested in the floral organs.

although aqag <dig> is consistently over-expressed in aqfie and aqemf <dig> silenced sepals and petals, we never saw any evidence of carpel identity in these organs. we therefore pooled cdna from several aqans- , aqfie-, and aqemf2-treated petals and sepals and used qrt-pcr to further examined the expression of aqag <dig> and aqag <dig> in these organs as well as in wild type carpels . we found that while aqag <dig> was clearly up-regulated in aqfie and aqemf <dig> silenced organs compared to the controls, aqag <dig> expression was still much lower than in wild type carpels . in contrast, aqag <dig> expression was similar in control and prc <dig> silenced tissue, but much lower than in wild type carpels.

lastly, in an effort to investigate the carotenoid production, we identified the likely a. x coerulea homologs of a range of components of the carotenoid pathway in a. thaliana, including enzymes involved in production  and carotenoid isomerase ) and breakdown  and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase  <dig> ) of carotenoids  <cit> . a. x coerulea has two copies ccd <dig>  and two genes that are closely related to a. thaliana psy . previous studies in a. thaliana have indicated that both crtiso and nced <dig> are positively epigenetically regulated by other set domain containing proteins so we were particularly interested in the expression of these genes in aqfie and aqemf <dig> down-regulated tissue  <cit> . we used rt-pcr to examine the expression of these six genes in aqans- , aqfie-, and aqemf2-treated petals . given the observed phenotypes, we might expect the expression of aqpsyl <dig>  aqpsyl <dig>  or aqcrtiso to be up-regulated or aqccd <dig>  aqccd4l, or aqnced <dig> to be down-regulated. unfortunately, no clear patterns are apparent from these reactions.

discussion
aqfie and aqemf <dig> vigs-treated plants displayed a range of lateral organ phenotypes. silenced leaves often had ruffled or curled lamina, additional lobing, and an increased frequency of higher order branching. the perianth organs were generally narrower than wild type organs. sepals were also curled and petals were stunted or had bent spurs, while petal limbs also had a particularly intense yellow coloration seemingly due to an accumulation of carotenoid pigments in these cells. many of the phenotypes we observed are similar to those seen in clf mutants and fie cosuppressed a. thaliana, including curled leaves and narrow perianth organs  <cit> . unlike clf mutants and ag over-expressers in a. thaliana, dramatic transformation towards carpel identity was not observed in the aqfie- and aqemf2-treated sepals or petals. however, the level of aqag <dig> expression in these organs was much less than what is seen in wild type aquilegia carpels. interestingly, the distinct folded morphology of the sepals may suggest slight transformation towards carpel identity as silenced leaves were folded towards the abaxial surface while the sepals were dramatically folded towards the adaxial surface, which is similar to the folding pattern of the aquilegia carpel  <cit> .

it is interesting to note that in aqfie silenced leaves, aqemf <dig> is also down-regulated. the reverse is not true in aqemf <dig> silenced leaves, and aqemf <dig> expression is not affected in aqfie silenced floral organs. this result suggests that prc <dig> may be directly or indirectly regulating aqemf <dig> expression in a. x coerulea leaves, which could account for the generally more severe phenotypes observed in aqfie silenced leaves compared to aqemf <dig> silenced leaves. aqemf <dig> is the only member of the complex that appears to be prc2-regulated as the expression of aqclf and aqswn is not affected in prc <dig> down-regulated leaves. in general, the potential for this type of cross-regulation is relatively unexplored in a. thaliana and, therefore, bears further study.

in our analysis of candidate target genes, we found that aqag <dig> is often ectopically expressed in prc <dig> down-regulated tissue. aqap3- <dig> and aqsep <dig> are also up-regulated in some organs, but expression of the class i knox genes and several candidate genes involved in carotenoid production or degradation seem largely unaffected. mutations in ag and sep <dig> are known to suppress the curled leaf phenotype in clf mutant plants while over-expression of these mads box genes, which themselves function together in a complex  <cit> , is thought to be the cause of the curled leaf phenotype  <cit> . it is, therefore, possible that over-expression of aqag <dig> and aqsep <dig> is similarly responsible for many of the observed phenotypes in aqfie and aqemf <dig> silenced leaves. these findings lead us to conclude that prc2-based regulation of ag and sep <dig> homologs is deeply conserved in eudicots. it has recently been shown that several chromatin remodeling factors associate with mads complexes and one model is that an important function of mads domain complexes may be to recruit chromatin remodeling complexes to target loci in order to alter transcription of these genes and direct organ development  <cit> . for example, relative of early flowering  <dig>  was enriched in protein complexes that were isolated via immunoprecipitation using tagged abce class mads box proteins  <cit> . ref <dig> has been shown to specifically demethylate h3k27me <dig>  the histone modification deposited by prc <dig>  <cit> . activation of sep <dig> by apetala <dig>  in a. thaliana results in the reduction of h3k27me <dig> at the sep <dig> promoter, suggesting that ap <dig> may recruit ref <dig> to the sep <dig> promoter in order to help induce sep <dig> gene function  <cit> . our data suggests that this key dependency on epigenetic regulation for the switch from vegetative to floral development may be important outside of a. thaliana. there are some complications, however. of the two a. x coerulea ag homologs, only one, aqag <dig>  is strongly regulated by prc <dig>  perhaps consistent with this observation, sequencing of the aquilegia genome  reveals that aqag <dig> does contain the large regulatory second intron that is common to ag homologs  <cit>  while aqag2’s second intron is much smaller. these results suggest that prc <dig> regulation can be directed in a paralog-specific fashion and may even play some role in the distinct expression patterns observed among these gene copies  <cit> .

the class i knox genes are directly or indirectly regulated by prc <dig> in both a. thaliana and physcomitrella, however, we detected little or no increase in knox gene expression in our aqfie and aqemf <dig> silenced leaves. this is somewhat surprising because of the higher order branching that we observed in silenced leaves, including several of the tested rna samples. the class i knox genes are thought to play a role in compound leaf development in a number of species. in many, but not all, compound leafed taxa where knox gene expression has been studied, including aquilegia, it has been shown that the genes are expressed in the shoot apical meristem and down-regulated in incipient leaf primordia , but subsequently turned back on in early leaf primordia  <cit> . down-regulation of class i knox genes in the leaves of models such as tomato or cardamine causes reduced branching while over-expression leads to increased branching  <cit> , suggesting that knox genes act to maintain indeterminacy in compound leaves and promote leaflet initiation.

there are several possible explanations for why we did not observe significant ectopic knox gene expression in our vigs-treated leaves. first, it is possible the knox genes were ectopically expressed early in leaf development when the higher order branching actually developed, but were later down-regulated by redundant mechanisms, such as asymmetric leaves  <dig> -mediated repression  <cit> . in a. thaliana as <dig> mediated silencing of some of the knox genes has been shown to require the prc <dig> complex and it is thought that as <dig> and as <dig> directly recruit the prc <dig> complex to knox loci  <cit> . however, it is important to remember that in other taxa with compound leaves, the knox and as <dig> homologs have lost their mutually exclusive regulatory interactions and are expressed together at later stages  <cit> . this may suggest that the as1-dependent epigenetic silencing of knox genes that has been described in several simple-leafed models  <cit>  does not hold for plants with compound leaves. along these lines, it is also possible that the increased branching phenotypes are due to other factors, such as accelerated phase change or novel genetic mechanisms regulating leaflet branching in aquilegia. for instance, a recent functional study of the gene aqfl <dig> in a. x coerulea revealed that it promotes proper leaf margin development, a unique finding for homologs of this gene lineage  <cit> . this raises the possibility that factors other than the knox genes contribute to compound leaf branching in aquilegia.

in addition to the conserved role in regulating ag, ap <dig>  and sep <dig>  a. x coerulea prc <dig> may target novel pathways, including those regulating carotenoid production or degradation. in a. thaliana patches of yellow anther-like tissue are observed on clf mutant petals  <cit> . however, the yellow pigmentation we observed is due to the accumulation of carotenoids in the plastids rather than to a partial homeotic transformation. while genes in the carotenoid pathway are not known to be suppressed by prc <dig>  some loci are positively epigenetically regulated in a. thaliana. previous studies have shown that a major enzyme in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, crtiso, requires the chromatin modifying enzyme set domain group  <dig>  to maintain its expression  <cit> . nced <dig>  an enzyme that cleaves some types of carotenoids as a part of abscisic acid  synthesis, is similarly epigenetically regulated by the a. thaliana trithorax homolog atx <dig>  <cit> . while none of the genes we tested were consistently up- or down-regulated in aqfie and aqemf <dig> silenced petals, carotenoid production is very genetically complex and we were unable to test all of the candidate loci  <cit> . thus, it seems likely that prc <dig> regulates an as yet unidentified enzyme in this pathway in a. x coerulea.

CONCLUSIONS
• a critical role for prc <dig> in maintaining the repression of ag, sep <dig>  and possibly ap <dig> appears to be conserved across eudicots. this conservation underscores the importance of chromatin remodeling factors in regulating the floral transition and the proper localization of floral organ identity.

• class i knox genes are not ectopically expressed in prc <dig> down-regulated tissue in a. x coerulea, possibly due to a regulatory shift associated with the evolution of compound leaves.

• a. x coerulea prc <dig> plays a significant role in regulating the carotenoid pathway in floral organs, which has not been observed in other taxa.

• this study, the first to examine prc <dig> function in angiosperms outside a. thaliana or the grasses, highlights how little we still know about the general conservation or targeting mechanisms underlying prc <dig> function in major developmental transitions.

petals. a. high magnification views of epidermal cells in a. x coerulea petal limbs. from left to right: anthocyanin of untreated petal limb , almost complete lack of color in aqans-silenced petal limb, and punctate pattern of carotenoid deposition in plastids of aqemf2-silenced petal limb. b. expression of several a. x coerulea homologs of genes important in carotenoid production  and degradation  in aqans-silenced control petals  and aqfie  and aqemf <dig>  treated petals. petals with strong yellow pigment are highlighted in dark yellow  and petals with pale yellow pigment are highlighted in light yellow . the expression of these genes is not consistently affected in the aqfie and aqemf <dig> silenced petal samples. it is possible that other genes in the carotenoid pathway are being misexpressed. scale bars: 10 μm.

additional candidate gene expression in prc <dig> vigs-treated leaves. a. expression of aqclf and aqswn in aqfie- and aqemf2-treated leaves. although aqemf <dig> appears to be down-regulated in some aqfie-silenced leaves, the expression of aqclf and aqswn in these leaves is not affected. b. expression of aqag <dig>  aqfl <dig>  aqap3- <dig>  aqap3- <dig>  and aqap3- <dig> in pooled aqans silenced control leaves  and aqfie  and aqemf <dig>  silenced leaves. aqap3- <dig> aqap3- <dig> and aqap3- <dig> is moderately up-regulated in both aqfie and aqemf <dig> silenced tissue while agfl <dig> expression is unaffected.
