BACKGROUND
nonhuman primates are commonly used in scientific research as animal models of human behavior and disease. although their use in research is overshadowed by the availability of less expensive and more abundant animal models such as rodents and zebrafish with easier husbandry, these animal models do not always provide the best translational medicine when trying to elucidate human pathologies. nonhuman primates represent an alternative to these animal models and provide distinct advantages owing to their phylogenetic proximity to humans that lends itself to greater genetic, physiological, neurological, and behavioral similarities  <cit> . historically this has been most strongly recognized in pharmacokinetic studies  <cit> . more recently, species differences have been pushed further with nonhuman primates showing increased translational validity in, for instance, regenerative medicine utilizing induced pluripotent stem cells  <cit>  and antiviral antibody therapy development  <cit> . macaque species are the most common nonhuman primate model, including the rhesus macaque  and the long-tailed macaque , also commonly known as the crab-eating or cynomolgus macaque.

despite a number of advantages to using nonhuman primates in biomedical research, there are distinct disadvantages that make studies in these animals difficult. captive nonhuman primates harbor greater genetic heterogeneity, as these animals are outbred relative to laboratory strains of rodents, which is complicated by another distinct disadvantage which is that studies are often comprised of much smaller sample sizes inherent in the increased costs required for acquisition and husbandry  <cit> . because it has become increasingly apparent in humans, and to a lesser extent macaques, that small changes in a gene or regulatory region can have large effects on the function of that gene, better information regarding genetic variation in these research models has become a necessity. the effects of genetic stratification or cryptic population substructure on studies, particularly where samples sizes are small, are significant  <cit> . in macaques, population differences have been identified with regards to behavior  <cit> , physiology  <cit> , susceptibility to infectious disease  <cit> , and toxicology  <cit> . therefore a priori genetic information on nonhuman primates used in research can aid in more informed selection of individuals for studies and better translational models.

the cynomolgus macaque is one of the most commonly used models in biomedical research  <cit> . these animals are particularly beneficial in common studies relating to toxicology and preclinical therapy development in which the closer ancestry of nonhuman primates to humans is desired . furthermore cynomolgus macaques specifically from the island of mauritius may provide the best alternative to indian origin rhesus macaques for studying hiv/aids based on a high level of mhc class i allele sharing  <cit> , and may be the only nonhuman primate animals for the study of hepatitis b virus as the virus is naturally occurring and transmissible only in this population of macaques  <cit> .

cynomolgus macaques originated in southeast asia and maintain a wide subtropical distribution ranging from vietnam, cambodia, thailand and malaysia to island populations in indonesia, the philippines and, more recently, mauritius. animals used in research are sourced from many of these locations and, while subpopulation differences are still minimally studied, potentially important genetic differences between populations are already recognized  <cit> . mauritian macaques are attractive for biomedical research for a number of reasons. one is their putative genetic homogeneity. the history of cynomolgus macaques on mauritius is largely undocumented, but many believe they arrived along with portuguese or dutch sailors sometime in the 16th century  <cit> . recent molecular work suggests these macaques derive from individuals from java, indonesia  <cit>  or more likely sumatra, indonesia  <cit> . cynomolgus macaques are broad generalists like their rhesus macaque sister species  <cit> . on the island of mauritius these macaques primarily exploit the human disturbed habitats and are an invasive species and a disruptive “pest”  <cit> .

with many cynomolgus macaques used in research sourced from mauritius, here we utilized a pseudogenomic approach to investigate population homogeneity in this group of macaques. although previous work has found little genetic heterogeneity  <cit> , recent work from our lab  <cit>  and others  <cit>  suggests population substructure in mauritian macaques that may have been missed. this study was therefore designed to follow-up on preliminary findings in the goswami et al.  <cit>  study and to utilize single nucleotide polymorphisms  from the study to develop a panel that differentiates between the two putative populations to screen a larger sample size. population genetic structure in mauritian cynomolgus macaques would be significant given the limitations of nonhuman primate research and would suggest that better care should be given to the selection of these animals for translational scientific research.

RESULTS
previous work  <cit>  found a signature of genetic substructure in  <dig> unrelated cynomolgus macaques on the island of mauritius. because the original study was not designed to detect population substructure, the variation it identified was not entirely evolutionarily neutral nor independent. while initial studies using bootstrapping showed the substructure to be robust, it remained unclear if there was a cryptic artifactual source. because substructure between geographically disparate cynomolgus macaque groups is well-established   <cit> , we first evaluated whether animals from the initial study were in fact mauritian-derived.

using mitochondrial  and y-chromosome dna , we tested whether the  <dig> animals from the goswami et al. study  <cit>  clustered with known mauritius-origin animals or with cynomolgus macaque populations from other parts of the species range including southeast asia, the philippines and indonesia. phylogenetic analysis of mtdna of  <dig> individuals  revealed  <dig> variable sites overall and  <dig> that were parsimony informative. from  <dig> of the  <dig> cynomolgus macaques in the initial study we obtained 794 bp of mtdna sequence data and from the last 721 bp. consistent with previous studies of mtdna variation in macaques our phylogenetic analysis distinguishes with high support cynomolgus macaques as a monophyletic clade distinct from m. mulatta, m. cyclopis, and m. fuscata . this analysis also distinguishes a vietnam clade, philippines clade and mauritius clade of cynomolgus macaques, with  <dig> of the initial subset of animals sharing a single haplotype,  <dig> differing from the common haplotype by a single nucleotide, and one with  <dig> unique singleton mutations, and all falling within the mauritius clade.figure  <dig>

analysis of the ydna revealed similar findings. combined sry and tspy sequence data of  <dig> individuals  revealed  <dig> variable sites overall and  <dig> that were parsimony informative. from the  <dig> cynomolgus macaques we obtained 612 bp of sry sequence data from each individual, and 2172 bp of tspy sequence data from  <dig> of the  <dig> individuals. for the rest at least  <dig> % of the full sequence length was covered. again consistent with previous studies, our phylogenetic analysis distinguishes the fascicularis group of macaques from other macaque species, with m. fuscata and m. cyclopis clustering with a clade of cynomolgus macaques from mainland southeast asia as well as m. mulatta . our analysis also distinguishes few but consistent mutations between the “continental” and “insular” clades  of cynomolgus macaques with the initial subset of animals clustering with other mauritius individuals in the “continental” clade , represented by only a single haplotype.figure  <dig> 
y-chromosome phylogeny of macaques. maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree derived from ~2850 bp of the sry and tspy genes to confirm provenance of cynomolgus macaques in the original goswami et al.  <cit>  study. notable clades are highlighted according to previous work on the subject  <cit>  and additional macaque groups are identified based on tosi et al.  <cit>  and defined in supplemental additional file 2: table s <dig>  including the monospecific arctoides  and sylvanus  groups, the sinica group, and the silenus group. animals from goswami et al.  <cit>  are highlighted in red and fall within the “continental” clade of cynomolgus macaques that includes those from mauritius, supporting that they derived from mauritius.



these mitochondrial and y chromosome dna analyses confirm that the initial subset of animals were indeed of mauritius-origin and that the genetic substructure identified is relevant to the island and not of a more general origin. it remains, however, that this initial study was not conceived as a population genetics, but rather as a functional genetics, study. the variation that was used in this initial analysis was not independent, was not entirely randomly distributed across the genome, and was not necessarily selectively neutral. in order to test the generalizability of the population substructure we sought to replicate the findings using a much larger pool of mauritian-origin cynomolgus macaques with specific snps chosen that would be more suitable to population genetic studies.

although we acknowledge the ascertainment bias, to further test the validity of these data we created a targeted snp panel of selected snps from the goswami et al.  <cit>  study prioritizing snps with the greatest differences in minor allele frequencies  between the two putative populations, an approach utilized previously in the literature for similar research . snps were further selected to be distributed relatively evenly across the  <dig> autosomes and were >150 kb apart  to enhance selection of independently inherited mutations and limiting selection of snps in physical linkage  <cit> . particular attention was also paid to selection of snps in selectively neutral regions although given the scope of the original paper, loci in untranslated regions  and coding regions could not be avoided and these are likely in regions that are under purifying selection. of the  <dig> assays designed to target the selected snp loci,  <dig> failed,  <dig> were deemed low quality assays, and  <dig> had call rates below our 95% cutoff level. an additional  <dig> were apparently monomorphic. it is unclear if these represent technical failures or identification failures. regardless, all these assays were excluded from the analysis. a total of  <dig> loci were therefore analyzed on additional cynomolgus macaques acquired from two primary sources of mauritius-origin cynomolgus monkeys  for a total of  <dig> individuals, including the  <dig> individuals in the original study.

structure analysis of the snp data on the  <dig> individuals supports the two population model suggested by goswami et al.  <cit> ; however, this dataset also suggests the possibility that three populations are represented by the data . the “correct” or “true” number of clusters has traditionally been identified by identifying the maximal value of log likelihood value, however, it has been established that log likelihood will plateau or increase incrementally at higher values of k once the “true” value is reached  <cit> . a difficulty lies in identifying at what point this plateau begins. evanno et al.  <cit>  proposes using the modal value of Δk, the second order rate of change divided by the standard deviation. here, both approaches are presented.figure  <dig>

the first approach used the informal guidelines outlined for structure v <dig>   <cit> . one hundred independent runs assuming admixture and correlated allele frequencies  with an mcmc length of  <dig>   converged on a k of  <dig> , where  <dig> is the smallest value of k when ln pr  plateaus. second, we used the more formal approach outlined by evanno et al.  <cit> . this approach suggests the “true k” exists where the second order rate of change of ln pr  with respect to k  is the greatest; in our dataset, this occurs at a k of  <dig>  . both interpretations of the dataset were consistent when estimating lambda  and when the mcmc length was increased to  <dig>   . given that the correlated allele frequencies model has the potential to overestimate k  <cit> , data was also run using the independent model even though it may not be appropriate for these data, and results did not change . it is therefore conservative to infer two subpopulations of cynomolgus macaques exist on the island of mauritius, but these data do not exclude a three subpopulation model.figure  <dig>

following these analyses, we were then able to revisit our snp panel. for each snp the minor allele frequencies in each subpopulation were determined from the structure analysis and we were able to recalculate Δmaf . perhaps as expected we saw a number of snps that did not differentiate between the subpopulations. for k of 2;  <dig> had Δmaf values less than 1% and  <dig> less than 2%. nevertheless, the overall median Δmaf for the  <dig> snps was  <dig> % and  <dig> of the  <dig> had Δmaf values greater than 10%. for k of  <dig>  only  <dig> snps do not show a Δmaf greater than 2% for at least one pair of subpopulations. the median maximum Δmaf is  <dig> %, while the median pairwise Δmaf are  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %. we also examined whether Δmaf values were correlated with chromosome and they are not , or snp position relative to gene, and again they are not . we are confident then that while this snp panel may not be of maximal power, it is free of artifactual biases.table  <dig>

data for two  and three  subpopulations is shown. some snps failed to differentiate between the subpopulations and are emphasized; given a k of  <dig>  Δmaf values less than 1% are highlighted in dark grey and Δmaf values between 1% and 2% are highlighted in light grey. minor allele designation is made relative to the population as a whole; some subpopulations may have minor allele frequencies greater than  <dig> . Δmaf: difference in minor allele frequencies between subpopulations.



to confirm the findings of the structure analysis, a second approach, discriminant analysis of principal components , was also performed to analyze the data. this methodology uses an approach conceptually similar to principal component analysis  with a focus on minimizing sources of within group variation  <cit> . k-means clustering on principal components derived from allele frequencies we compared using bayesian information criteria  . as with structure, results suggest two or three subgroups with k-means clustering slightly favoring the latter. using dapc with either k of  <dig>  or k of  <dig>  it is possible to visualize membership within these groups. though there is a real question of overfitting of the data with dapc, it is clear that the findings of structure hold up across different methodologies.figure  <dig> 
discriminant analysis of principal components  to infer population substructure. a. bayesian inference criterion  values versus number of clusters  b. inferred ancestry with k =  <dig> c. inferred ancestry with k =  <dig>  results support structure analysis findings that suggest the data are best represented by two or three subpopulations. this analysis however suggests three subpopulations may be more likely than two given the lower bic value when k =  <dig> 



regardless of whether there are two or three subpopulations, moderate admixture  is observed and suggests either reproductively isolated populations with hybrid zones or historic isolation that no longer exists. previous work on mauritian cynomolgus macaques has suggested genetic substructure with a putative northern and southern population based on microsatellite loci  <cit> . unfortunately capture location data on all the individuals in this study could not be acquired and therefore it is difficult to evaluate whether we see a similar pattern. capture location data provided by bioculture mauritius/charles river laboratories however on the original subset of  <dig> macaques does not support an obvious physical barrier to gene flow or geographic pattern , but does not exclude the potential for an unrecognized ecological “barrier.” these data further do not support population differences based on source/dealer; cynomolgus monkeys from both cynologics ltd. and bioculture mauritius ltd. are represented in each of the subpopulations .

importantly, it seems that despite this population substructure most animals are significantly admixed and the structure may be decaying. unlike other subpopulations of cynomolgus macaques, such as those from the various “continental” and “insular” location, or the indian-origin and chinese-origin rhesus, the two subpopulations of mauritian macaques appear largely admixed. this can be envisioned similarly to the collaborative cross of laboratory mouse strains  <cit> , chinese-indian hybrid colonies of rhesus macaques  <cit> , or even admixed human populations such as african-americans  <cit>  or latinos  <cit> . admixed populations can offer demographic challenges similar to other sources of cryptic population substructure, but can also be important in the mapping of quantitative traits  <cit> . in the preclinical studies where mauritian cynomolgus macaques are often used, this can mean both that there may be cryptic genetic effects on phenotypes of study, potentially confounding experimental and control groups, and that it may be more straightforward to identify functional genetic variation associated with the phenotypes. to do so would, naturally, require a higher density of genetic variation than we have made use of here, but with next generation sequencing costs becoming increasingly more tractable, this is perhaps a fertile area for future study.

the underlying cause of this apparent population stratification remains unknown. an ecological separation remains possible, but there is little evidence to support this hypothesis and the likelihood of it causing pervasive genome wide effects in such a relatively short time seems minimal. what may be more likely given the relatively recent introduction of macaques to mauritius by mariners is that these data may suggest either two or three independent founding events and/or, knowing that significant genetic structure exists among cynomolgus macaques outside of mauritius  <cit> , founding individuals derived from two or three different locales in their native range. it is also possible that these data simply reflect more traditional founder effects, particularly if effective founding populations among extant animals were lower than previously appreciated.

CONCLUSIONS
animal models are an important component of preclinical biomedical research and critical to the translational success of new drugs and therapies. just as the importance of cryptic substructure in human studies became increasingly recognized, so too now do we recognize its importance in animal models. in laboratory mice and rats, animals are almost always inbred and genetically identical, but non-human primates are outbred and can harbor genetic variation often exceeding that seen in humans. moreover, an increasing number of studies have identified segregating common variation with explicit functional effects on many of the characteristics under study in these animals. it is important, therefore, that the genetic substructure of populations be taken into account.

cynomolgus macaques are among the most widely used of non-human primate model species, particularly in industry, and among cynomolgus macaques those sourced from mauritius are particularly prevalent. moving into the post-genomic era, it has become increasingly possible to tease apart the complex demographic history and extant genetic difference among this population. although there are no obvious or otherwise documented phenotypic  differences among these subpopulations of cynomolgus macaques on the island of mauritius, given the results of our study it is entirely possible that observed phenotypic variability among mauritian cynomolgus macaques  <cit>  may accompany the genetic substructure. and while the substructure does not appear to be as stark or as significant as that between, for instance, chinese- and indian-origin rhesus macaques or subpopulations of cynomolgus macaques from vietnam, indonesia, and the philippines, it has nevertheless aroused interest and investigation into these differences would be a meaningful avenue of future research.

here we demonstrate at least two, and possibly three, subpopulations of cynomolgus macaques on mauritius. we propose that this stratification is suggestive of either an unknown and previously unrecognized barrier to gene flow, or the remains of genetic substructure among mauritian cynomolgus macaques following distinct founding events and/or founding individuals approximately 500 years ago. this effort has served to not only elucidate the natural history of cynomolgus macaques on mauritius, but to also better inform studies that use these animals.
