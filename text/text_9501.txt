BACKGROUND
inorganic polyphosphates and the exopolyphosphatases/pyrophosphatases involved in their hydrolysis play an important role in the phosphate and energy metabolism of all living organisms  <cit> . the polyphosphates, linear polymers ranging from two to hundreds of phosphate residues linked by high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds, are mostly concentrated in specialized organelles, the volutin granules or acidocalcisomes  <cit> . they serve as osmotically inert phosphate and energy stores that also contain high concentrations of divalent cations and basic amino acids. hydrolysis by polyphosphatases and pyrophosphatases provides phosphate in periods of phosphate limitation  <cit>  or to control osmotic stress  <cit> . besides these roles that require massive amounts of polyphosphates, both molecular species, polyphosphates and pyrophosphate, may also exert more subtle cytosolic functions, such as e.g. gating the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  <cit> .

the polyphosphatases belong to the large superfamily of the dhh phosphoesterases  <cit> . this superfamily is divided into two subfamilies that share four n terminal signature motifs. they differ in their c-terminal moieties where subfamily  <dig> carries two additional conserved motifs. subfamily  <dig> includes the bacterial recj nucleases, while subfamily  <dig> members fall into three functional groups, the pyrophosphatases, the exopolyphosphatases and the closely related "prune-type" exopolyphosphatases. the exopolyphosphatase/pyrophosphatase groups and the prune group can be readily distinguished since members of the former group carry the sequences dhn and dhh in their motifs ii and iii, respectively, while all prunes carry the sequences dhh and dhr at the respective positions  <cit> . within the prune group, vertebrate prunes are distinguished from their non-vertebrate homologues by the acquisition of a c-terminal extension of about  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . this region contains a proline-rich and a helical domain which are essential for the physical interaction of human prune with nucleoside diphosphate kinase a  and glycogen synthase kinase 3b  <cit> . human prune is a short-chain selective exopolyphosphatase that preferentially hydrolyzes tri- and tetrapolyphosphates, as well as nucleoside 5'-tetraphosphates  <cit> .

the kinetoplastids, a group of unicellular eukaryotes that comprises many important pathogens, contain prominent polyphosphate storage organelles, the acidocalcisomes. these acidic, electron-dense compartments contain the major part of the cellular polyphosphate, as well as high concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, zinc, iron and the basic amino acids arginine and lysine  <cit> . the polyphosphate content of the acidocalcisomes changes rapidly under conditions of hyper- or hypoosmotic stress  <cit> . in t. brucei, an acidocalcisomal pyrophosphatase tbvsp <dig> was characterized  <cit>  and a series of inhibitors against this enzyme were developed  <cit> . this pyrophosphatase preferentially hydrolyzes inorganic pyrophosphate, with gradually decreasing activity against polyphosphates of higher chain lengths. in l. major, an exopolyphosphatase, lmppx, was identified which exhibited a preference for short-chain polyphosphates. this enzyme appears to be located both in the cytosol and in the acidocalcisomes  <cit> . similar results were also obtained with its homologue of t. cruzi, tcppx  <cit> . this enzyme does not hydrolyze long-chain inorganic polyphosphates or atp. it is highly active against polyphosphates of short chain length , with strongly decreasing activity for longer chain polyphosphates. overexpression of the enzyme delayed the regulatory volume decrease after hypoosmotic shock, suggesting that it may play a role in osmoregulation. the selectivity of all known kinetoplastid polyphosphatases for short chain polyphosphates is in line with the observation that the average polyphosphate chain length in these organisms is only  <dig> to  <dig> residues  <cit> . a preliminary report also documented the recombinant expression and refolding of a t. brucei exopolyphosphatase and provided initial data on its activity  <cit> .

the current study provides a general overview over the pyrophosphatases and exopolyphosphatases of the kinetoplastida, and it identifies, localizes and characterizes the exopolyphosphatase tbrppx <dig> from t. brucei. furthermore, it demonstrates that tbrppx <dig> does not contain a cyclic-nucleotide specific phosphodiesterase activity, as had been reported earlier for the human prune enzyme  <cit> .

RESULTS
identification of exopolyphosphatases and pyrophosphatases in the kinetoplastids
tbrppx <dig> was identified by blastp searching of the t. brucei database with the amino acid sequence of human prune . a single copy gene  was identified on chromosome  <dig> . tbrppx <dig> is a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig> da and a pi of  <dig> . the polypeptide contains a dhh domain  and a dhha <dig> domain  that identify it as a member of the dhh superfamily. the dhh domain contains the characteristic four motifs i - iv, while domain dhha <dig> contains the two additional motifs v and vi that identify tbrppx <dig> as a member of subfamily  <dig> of the dhh superfamily . tbrppx <dig> is predicted to be a exopolyphosphatase due to the presence of the conserved motif g27negg <dig> <cit> . all exopolyphosphatases carry an asparagine in the position corresponding to n <dig> of tbrppx <dig>  while this residue is replaced by a histidine in the pyrophosphatases. this histidine is part of the first of two metal binding domains in pyrophosphatases. furthermore, in motifs ii and iii, tbrppx <dig> contains the sequence motifs dhn and dhh, respectively, which set it apart from the prune subfamily that contains the motifs dhh and dhr at the respective positions  <cit> . characteristically, tbrppx <dig> also lacks the c-terminal extension of about  <dig> amino acids that is present in all vertebrate prunes, but is absent from the invertebrate prune homologues  <cit>  and from the exopolyphosphatases.

blast searching of the genomic databases of t. congolense, t. vivax, t. cruzi, l. major, l. infantum, l. brasiliensis and l. tarentolae with tbrppx <dig> demonstrated the presence of one orthologue of tbrppx <dig>  in each genome . the identical set of genes was also retrieved when searching the databases with the s. cerevisiae exopolyphosphatase scppx <dig> . all these tbrppx <dig> homologues  share extensive sequence conservation and consist of about  <dig> amino acids, with calculated isoelectric points of about  <dig> . for several of them, an exopolyphosphatase activity has been experimentally demonstrated .

group  <dig> contains the exopolyphosphatases, and group  <dig> consists of the acidocalcisomal inorganic pyrophosphatases. for both groups, the activities of representative members have been experimentally determined. group  <dig> represents a homogeneous group of predicted, putatively cytosolic inorganic pyrophosphatases for which no experimental data are available so far. designations are by gene name , by the trembl database nomenclature and by gene identification number . total amino acid numbers and calculated molecular mass and pi values are also given.

analysis of the kinetoplastid genomes for the presence of additional poly- or pyrophosphatases resulted in the identification of two additional groups . group  <dig> represents the kinetoplastid-specific acidocalcisomal pyrophosphatases, one of which  has been experimentally characterized  <cit> . their lengths vary from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, with isoelectric points between  <dig>  and  <dig> . they are all characterized by an inorganic pyrophosphatase domain  which, in tb <dig> . <dig> extends from amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  finally, group  <dig> represents yet uncharacterized, putatively cytosolic pyrophosphatases, with lengths from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and pis varying from  <dig>  to  <dig> . their sequences also contain the inorganic pyrophosphatase domain, extending from about amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  interestingly, no recognizable genes coding for endopolyphosphatases were detected in any of the kinetoplastid genomes.

expression and subcellular localization of tbrppx1
rt-pcr and northern blotting demonstrated that the tbrppx <dig> gene is expressed at similar levels both in bloodstream and in procyclic forms. the major transcripts in both stages carry a very short 5'-untranslated region of only  <dig> nucleotides length .

to establish the subcellular localization of tbrppx <dig> in procyclic and bloodstream form trypanosomes, one allele was c-terminally tagged with a triple c-myc tag  <cit> . the correct integration of the tagging construct was verified by southern blot analysis of genomic dna, and the expression of the tagged protein was confirmed by western blotting. immunofluorescence microscopy of procyclic cells showed an intense but diffuse cytosolic staining throughout the entire cell body, but not in the flagellum .

in the bloodstream form, staining was also found throughout the cell body, but was significantly more granular . staining of the cells with an antibody against the tbv-h+-ppase, an acidocalcisome marker  <cit>  visualized the well defined acidocalcisomes throughout the cell . in procyclics, the distinct localization of the acidocalcisomes clearly contrasted with the homogeneous, diffuse distribution of tbrppx <dig>  in the bloodstream form, both tbrppx <dig> and acidocalcisomes show defined, punctate localizations, which however do not colocalize. these observations are similar to what was found with the l. major homologue lmppx  <cit> , suggesting that the protein is similarly localized in both species. no fluorescence was observed in control wild type procyclic  <dig> and bloodstream  <dig> cells incubated with mouse monoclonal antic- myc antibody, and in control parasites incubated only in the presence of the secondary fluorescein-labelled goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit igg. triton-fractionation of procyclic and bloodstream trypanosomes showed that tbrppx <dig> is fully triton-soluble and is not an integral part of the cytoskeleton .

knocking out tbrppx <dig> in procyclic trypanosomes
in order to assess the function of ppx <dig> in procyclic t. brucei, a gene knockout was performed. the first tbrppx <dig> allele was replaced by a neomycin resistance and the second allele was replaced by a hygromycin resistance gene. the homozygous deletion of tbrppx <dig> in two independent clones was confirmed by genomic pcr and by southern blot . the knock-out strains exhibited only a subtle growth phenotype. the mean generation time of the knock-out clones was determined in two independent experiments for each clone. when compared to wild type procyclic  <dig> cells, it was increased by  <dig>  h and by  <dig>  h for clones c2- <dig> and c2- <dig>  respectively. growth of wild-type cells and knock-out clones in hypoosmotic medium  did not appreciably change the generation time of either strain . to determine if ppx <dig> might be involved in regulating the cellular energy level, total cellular atp was determined. interestingly, the two independent knock-out clones exhibited different atp contents, but in either case this was lower than that of wild type cells  for wild type vs  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  for clones c2- <dig> and c2- <dig>  respectively). dapi staining revealed that clones c2- <dig> and c2- <dig> had a normal nucleus/kinetoplast ratio when . the number and size of acidocalcisomes as well as their subcellular distribution seemed to remain unchanged between wild type cells and the two knock-out clones . similarly, the cellular polyphosphate content remained unaltered between wild-type and tbrppx <dig> knock-out clones .

bloodstream trypanosomes are not sensitive to rnai against tbrppx1
attempts to construct viable tbrppx <dig> knock-outs in bloodstream forms failed repetitively. therefore, rnai was attempted as an alternative procedure. northern blot analysis of tbrppx <dig> rnai strains in the presence or absence of  <dig> μg/ml tetracycline demonstrated that the rnai constructs were functional and that the level of target mrna was strongly reduced . nevertheless, rnai-mediated gene knock-down of tbrppx <dig> in the presence of tetracycline did not result in a significant change of growth rates in culture . no changes in cell morphology could be observed. when rnai was induced for  <dig> h against ppx <dig> in both clones, a <dig> and a <dig>  no change in either atp concentration or polyphosphate content was observed. both clones were then used in two independent experiments to infect mice that had received tetracycline in their drinking water to induce rnai. no difference in virulence was observed between mice receiving tetracycline and control animals. in conjunction, these data suggest that tbrppx <dig> may not be an essential gene in bloodstream form t. brucei, neither in cell culture nor during an in vivo infection.

characterization of recombinant tbrppx1
tbrppx <dig> was expressed in e. coli bl <dig> cells as a fusion protein with either an n-terminal gst tag or an n-terminal mbp tag, using the pgst- or pmbp parallel <dig> vectors  <cit> . induction of protein expression with  <dig>  mm iptg overnight at 15°c resulted in mostly soluble fusion protein. the recombinant proteins were isolated by passage over glutathione- or amylose-resin. both recombinant proteins migrated with the expected molecular masses . initial activity measurement using pentasodium triphosphate as a substrate demonstrated that the gst-fusion protein was active, while the mbp fusion construct was completely inactive. in contrast to what was observed with lmjppx <dig>  <cit> , recombinant tbrppx <dig> was stable after purification, and could be frozen and thawed repeatedly without loss of activity when kept in elution buffer containing 10% glycerol and  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>  as expected from its sequence, tbrppx <dig> proved to be an exopolyphosphatase. its km for pentasodium triphosphate as a substrate is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm , and its kcat is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s- <dig> .

sodium pyrophosphate  and polyphosphate  are neither substrates nor inhibitors. the activity of tbrppx <dig> is entirely dependent on divalent cations, and it is not affected by camp, deoxynucleoside triphosphates, atp, sodium pyrophosphate, by basic amino acids that are enriched in the acidocalcisomes such as arginine, or by long polyanions such as heparin or rna . also, tbrppx <dig> is not inhibited by a series of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as ro-20- <dig>  sildenafil, zaprinast, papaverine or etazolate, or the sodium salts of vanadate, fluoride or sulfate. zn2+ is a strong inhibitor with an ic <dig> value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  when the reaction is run in the presence of  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> .

lack of camp-pde activity in endogenous tbrppx1
human prune, a closely related exopolyphosphatase  <cit>  was reported to also contain a camp-specific phosphodiesterase activity  <cit> . if true, this finding would have the potential to profoundly alter the current paradigms of eukaryotic camp signaling, which are largely based on class  <dig> cyclic nucleotide-specific phosphodiesterases as the only mechanisms for rapidly disposing of camp  <cit> . to investigate if tbrppx <dig> might show a similar activity, recombinant tbrppx <dig> was tested for possible camp phosphodiesterase activity. no camp hydrolysis could be detected. to ascertain that the observed lack of pde activity was not due to the fact that a recombinant protein was used, tbrppx <dig> was also analyzed after immunoprecipitation from trypanosome lysates. 3× c-myc tagged tbrppx <dig> protein from ~  <dig>  ×  <dig> procyclic cells was immunoprecipitated, and the precipitates were assayed for pde catalytic activity. control precipitates were done with lysates from cells expressing the 3× c-myc tagged phosphodiesterase tbrpdeb <dig>  the results demonstrate that immunoprecipitated tbrppx <dig> does not exhibit detectable pde-activity while such an activity is easily detected with an immunoprecipitated control pde . these findings agree with those obtained with the recombinant protein, and they support more recent experiments with human prune that also failed to detect an intrinsic pde activity  <cit> .

a third approach attempting to demonstrate phosphodiesterase activity in tbrppx <dig> used a very sensitive in-vivo complementation system for phosphodiesterase activity  <cit> . the assay consists in the reversion of a phosphodiesterase-deficient, and therefore heatsensitive strain of s. cerevisiae to heat-shock resistance through the introduction of a heterologous phosphodiesterase activity. the assay is exquisitely sensitive for camp-phosphodiesterase activity and allows its detection even under conditions where no activity can be biochemically measured in the corresponding yeast cell lysates  <cit> . western blot analysis of the yeast lysates demonstrated that tbrppx <dig> is stably expressed in all of the five yeast clones tested . nevertheless, tbrppx <dig> did not restore the heat shock resistance phenotype to the pde-deficient indicator strain , whereas tcrpdec, a control phosphodiesterase from trypanosoma cruzi  <cit> , did fully restore this phenotype. the results of these complementation experiments further support the view that tbrppx <dig> protein does not contain camp-phosphodiesterase activity.

discussion
the currently available genomes of kinetoplastids all harbor genes for three different groups of polyphosphatases that belong to subfamily  <dig> of the dhh superfamily. group  <dig>  comprises the cytosolic exopolyphosphatases  that are related to those e.g. of the ascomycota such as s. cerevisiae. group  <dig> enzymes have been characterized in t. cruzi  <cit>  and in l. major  <cit> , and preliminary report has indicated a corresponding activity in t. brucei  <cit> . group  <dig> contains predicted acidocalcisomal pyrophosphatases  that are specific for the kinetoplastids, and group  <dig> consists of putative inorganic pyrophosphatases  for which no experimental evidence is yet available. the two latter groups share extensive sequence identity among themselves as well as with the fungal inorganic pyrophosphatases throughout their catalytic domains. the group  <dig> enzymes  all contain an additional n-terminal extension of  <dig> -  <dig> amino acids. these extensions are highly similar between all kinetoplastids species and may contain the information for their acidocalcisomal localization. in t. brucei, the group  <dig> pyrophosphatase tbrvsp <dig> has been characterized experimentally  <cit> .

the cytosolic exopolyphosphatases  enzymes are encoded by single-copy genes in all kinetoplastid genomes, with the exception of t. cruzi whose genome contains three such genes. tbrppx <dig> of t. brucei encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and a pi of  <dig> . interestingly, no gene for endopolyphosphatases have yet been detected in the kinetoplastid genomes. these might not be required since the average length of the polyphosphates in these organisms is so short  that they could be efficiently handled by exopolyphosphatases alone. in addition, the demonstrated capacity of pyrophosphatase tbrvsp <dig> to slowly hydrolyze even long-chain polyphosphates might be sufficient for taking care of the occasional long-chain polyphosphate.

analysis of the subcellular localization of tbrppx <dig> demonstrated that it is present throughout the cell body, in agreement with the ppx <dig> enzymes being cytosolic exopolyphosphatases in other organisms as well. in procyclic trypanosomes, it is homogeneously distributed throughout the entire cytoplasm, with no evidence for specific co-localization with the acidocalcisomes. this is similar to the subcellular localization observed with its homologue in l. major  <cit> . in the bloodstream form, tbrppx <dig> is localized in more granular structures throughout the cytoplasm, suggesting that its subcellular organization might be lifecycle stage dependent. nevertheless, these granules exhibit no specific co-localization with the acidocalcisomes. in both stages, tbrppx <dig> is excluded from the flagellum. upon cell fractionation of either procyclic or bloodstream cells with the non-ionic detergent triton x- <dig>  tbrppx <dig> partitions quantitatively into the soluble phase, demonstrating that it is not firmly associated to cytoskeletal structures in either life cycle stage. this is in agreement with the observation that tbrppx <dig>  similar to lmppx  <cit> , lacks an n-terminal signal sequence, suggesting that it does not enter the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated secretory pathway, but is synthesized on free polysomes and then kept in the cytosol.

tbrppx <dig> is an active exopolyphosphatase that accepts inorganic pentasodium triphosphate as a substrate, but neither nucleoside triphosphates nor inorganic pyrophosphate. the marked inhibition of tbrppx <dig> by zn2+ ions even in the presence of a large excess of mg2+ is reminiscent to what was reported for its l. major  <cit>  and t. cruzi  <cit>  homologues.

several experimental approaches have demonstrated that tbrppx <dig> definitely does not contain an endogenous camp-phosphodiesterase activity. this is in agreement with recent similar findings with human prune  <cit>  for which such an activity had initially been postulated  <cit> . also, the exopolyphosphatase activity of tbrppx <dig> is not inhibited by several inhibitors with specificities against different human cyclic nucleotide-specific phosphodiesterases. these findings support the central paradigm of camp signaling in eukaryotes which posits that the cyclic nucleotide-specific phosphodiesterases represent the only mechanism for a rapid disposal of camp.

tbrppx <dig> is not essential in t. brucei, neither in the procyclic nor in the bloodstream form. gene ablation by genetic knock-out or knock-down by rnai only slightly prolonged the generation time. furthermore, in-vivo rnai in a mouse model did not abolish the virulence of two independent rnai clones. the absence of a dramatic phenotype is in agreement with the observation that the overall polyphosphate content of wild type versus tbrppx1-knockout cells was not changed, suggesting that tbrppx <dig> is not involved in the quantitative management of polyphosphate stores. the overall polyphosphate content measured for t. brucei in this study is in good agreement with earlier findings with t. cruzi  <cit> . the observed lack of a significant phenotype in the tbrppx <dig> knock-outs is also in good agreement with similar findings in s. cerevisiae, where inactivation of the exopolyphosphatases ppx <dig> and ppn <dig> did not prevent the utilization of polyphosphates as a phosphate reserve  <cit> . knocking out ppx <dig> does only slightly downregulate the cellular atp content, indicating that ppx <dig> is not a major contributor to the cellular energy balance. these findings are in marked contrast to what was observed with a group  <dig> enzyme, the acidocalcisomal pyrophosphatase tbrvsp <dig>  <cit> , which clearly is an essential enzyme, also for in vivo infections. in conclusion, the cytosolic exonuclease tbrppx <dig> seems to play only a modulatory role in the overall polyphosphate metabolism of t. brucei, and it plays no significant role in the overall energy balance of trypanosomes. it might possibly fulfil a specific role in handling local cytoplasmic pools of polyphosphates that are quantitatively minor compared to the acidocalcisomal polyphosphate stores.

alternatively, tbrppx <dig> might be crucial to optimize the phosphate metabolism in specific situations or life cycle stages, but might have no major role for cell proliferation during the easy life in the affluent environment of a culture medium or a mammalian host.

CONCLUSIONS
the genomes of all kinetoplastida sequenced to data contain a similar set of genes that code for polyphosphatases. the group  <dig> enzymes, including tbrppx <dig>  are exopolyphosphatases . groups  <dig> and  <dig> represent pyrophosphatases, where the group  <dig> enzymes are located in the acidocalcisomes  <cit> , while the group  <dig> enzymes are most likely cytoplasmic, though no experimental data on any of them are available yet. tbrppx <dig> is an exopolyphosphatase which is specific for inorganic polyphosphate, and it exhibits a km value of around  <dig> μm for pentasodium triphosphate. it does not hydrolyze, nor is it inhibited by organic polyposphates such as atp, or by na-pyrophosphate. the enzyme activity is completely inhibited by edta, and it is also strongly inhibited by zn2+, even in the presence of a large molar excess of mg2+. an important aspect in the context of intracellular signaling is the observation that tbrppx <dig> does not exert cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity, as has been postulated earlier for the human prune exopolyphosphatase  <cit> . while the current study was in progress, this claim for the human enzyme has been essentially retracted  <cit> . immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that tbrppx <dig> is localized throughout the cytoplasm, without a recognizable association with subcellular structures. a genetic knockout of tbrppx <dig>  or its knock-down via rna interference do not produce dramatic phenotypes. in agreement, the overall polyphosphate content in the various mutants is not significantly different from the respective wild type cells. combined with the observation that tbrppx <dig> is localized in the cytoplasm and is not associated with the major polyphosphate stores, the acidocalcisomes, the data indicate that tbrppx <dig> may not be involved in the phosphate/polyphosphate metabolism on a quantitative scale. rather, it might exert modulatory functions based on cytoplasmic polyphosphate that cannot be identified by simple genetic knock-out experiments.
