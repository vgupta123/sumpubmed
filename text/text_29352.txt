BACKGROUND
metabolic engineering is the enabling technology for identification of targeted genetic modifications such as gene deletion, over-expression, or modulation. the genetic engineering implemented in a host microbial cell factory ideally will lead to re-direction of fluxes to enhance production or robustness of a given product or organism, respectively  <cit> . metabolic engineering through systems biology has been complimented, and its application expanded in both scope and success. systems biology is a multi-disciplinary approach to quantitative collection, analysis, and integration of whole genome scale data sets enabling construction of biologically relevant and often predictive mathematical models  <cit> . genome sequencing of industrially relevant organisms, including s. cerevisiae strain s288c, the first eukaryote genome sequence reported, provided a framework for gene annotation through functional genomics. more relevant to metabolic engineering, an annotated genome sequence was a prerequisite for genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions  <cit> . such reconstructions offer a biochemical model describing the formation and depletion of each metabolite that by providing mass-balance boundary conditions makes possible constraint based simulations of how the metabolic network operates at different conditions. in simpler terms, using basic stoichiometry these models can be used to predict the relationships between gene functions in the cellular metabolic network. with nearly  <dig> years elapsing since the s. cerevisiae strain s288c genome sequence was made available, and more than  <dig>  laboratories participating in functional genomics efforts, there are still  <dig> and  <dig> open reading frames  classified as uncharacterized and dubious, respectively, according to the saccharomyces genome database   <cit> . furthermore, since  <dig> there have been published five major s. cerevisiae genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions, with the most recent models encompassing between 13-14% genome coverage  <cit> . the opportunity to further extend genotype to phenotype annotation is abundant.

industrial biotechnology is dominated by efforts to confer a desirable phenotype onto strains using different methods of directed evolution and random mutagenesis, requiring screening and selection. this approach, while providing little to no mechanistic understanding of which specific genetic perturbations lead to improved strains so they could be further exploited, has proven to be commercially successful as illustrated by the more than  <dig>  fold improvement in penicillin titer by penicillium chrysogenum  <cit> . as industrial biotechnology applications expand, and the desire to custom-engineer microbial cell factories with novel architecture for native and heterologous metabolic pathways increases, the necessity on a genome-wide level to understand direct genotype to phenotype relationships has rapidly increased. within the same time period of approximately the last  <dig> years, the technologies and costs associated with whole genome sequencing have advanced and decreased, respectively. there are several excellent reviews of genome sequencing technologies, and their applications to functional genomics, strain engineering, and other investigatory biology efforts  <cit> . prior work, specifically focused on characterizing genome-wide analysis of nucleotide polymorphisms in s. cerevisiae utilized 25mers oligonucleotide microarrays  providing random and redundant coverage of the s. cerevisiae genome  <cit> . this analysis included single nucleotide polymorphism  identification between s288c and the commonly used laboratory strain s. cerevisiae cen.pk, where a total of  <dig>  snps were identified. however, this approach is unable to identify the exact nucleotide substitution, and consequently whether the transcribed snp results in an amino acid substitution, presumably required to confer a change in enzyme and/or protein function. more recently a collaborative project, the saccharomyces genome resequencing project  between the sanger institute and institute of genetics, university of nottingham, completed the abi sequencing of haploids of  <dig> s. cerevisiae strains to a coverage of 1-3x. furthermore, illumina-solexa genome sequencing of four of the  <dig> s. cerevisiae strains, one of which included s288c, was completed  <cit> . this sequencing effort was focused on exploration of genomic variation in the context of evolution, thereby using multiple strains from different saccharomyces species. it is a demonstration of a recent genome sequencing technology, referred to as illumina-solexa sequencing, compared to larger read methods such as sanger or  <dig> sequencing. illumina-solexa sequencing is an ultra-high-throughput technology that performs sequencing-by-synthesis of random arrays of clonal dna colonies attached to the surface of a flow-cell. the approach used in this study generates short,  <dig> base pair  reads , that must then be aligned to and assembled using a reference genome  <cit> .

in this work we propose that high-throughput genome sequencing and annotation, integrated with a genome browser and snp viewer of s. cerevisiae may serve as a commonplace tool, complementary to transcriptomics and physiological characterization, to extract direct genotype to phenotype information. firstly, whole genome illumina-solexa sequencing of each strain was completed and then annotation was performed. to access annotated genome sequences and detected snps of cen.pk113-7d, a genome browser and snp viewer were developed. snps strictly related to metabolic genes were identified, characterized, and amino acid level analysis performed. in order to directly link genotype to phenotype cellular behavior was characterized in well-controlled batch fermentations on glucose and galactose, complimented with transcriptome analysis. more specifically, we demonstrate that s288c, the strain utilized for the publically available s. cerevisiae genome sequence, exhibits atypical s. cerevisiae behavior related to central carbon metabolism as compared to cen.pk113-7d, a common laboratory strain for industrial biotechnology applications  <cit> .

there were clear correlations between physiology and metabolic pathway enrichment of nonsynonymous snps observed, suggesting that sequencing and the annotated genome may assist in reducing the genetic target space for metabolic engineering applications. the analysis presented here serves as a foundation for comparative metabolic engineering snp analysis, wherein the future reference strains may be compared to their metabolically engineered derivatives that use directed evolution in order to answer the age-old question: what changed in our strain that makes it a preferred microbial cell factory?

RESULTS
genome sequencing and annotation
the genome sequencing of s. cerevisiae strain cen.pk113-7d and genome re-sequencing of strain s288c were accomplished using the illumina/solexa technology. according to the manufacturer's recommendations , raw sequence reads of strain cen.pk113-7d and strain s288c were accumulated to approximately 18× and 15× depth coverage, respectively. reads were mapped on the s288c as reference genome using maq software http://maq.sourceforge.net. based on genome sequence analysis and annotation , the  <dig>  mb genome was predicted to contain a total of  <dig>  genes encoding proteins. the genome was predicted to comprise  <dig> chromosomes by pair-wise comparison against the  <dig> different chromosomes of the public reference strain s288c from the saccharomyces genome database . interestingly, we found that genome characteristics of strain cen.pk113-7d are very similar to s288c for genome parameters that include total size, chromosome length, gc content, and the number of predicted genes. table  <dig> summarizes illumina genome sequencing and annotation results.

genome browser and snp viewer
to visualize genome sequences, annotated genes, and detected snps of s. cerevisiae cen.pk 113-7d, a php-mysql-based genome browser and snp viewer were developed and deposited on the web-site . the basic genome browser functionality, as seen in figure  <dig>  can provide genome annotation views with an overhead bar providing a visual indication of chromosome position. it is possible to navigate by dragging the display left or right creating a smooth panning effect. alternatively, one can navigate directly to a region  of interest by providing the region coordinates or typing a feature name into the quick search box. the browser can display basic genomic features of interest . similarly, for the snp viewer one can visualize nucleotide and amino acid polymorphism data between s. cerevisiae strains. the whole gene containing a snp  can be displayed by dragging left or right button , and also highlight the mutated position , silent snp ) between s. cerevisiae strains.

snps identification in metabolism
based on whole genome sequencing, data that includes the number of reads, average coverage relative to the sgd reference genome, total number of non-ambiguous snps, and total number of filtered snps and detected snps error are presented in table  <dig>  not surprisingly, s288c had relatively few snps compared to cen.pk113-7d given that the reference genome from sgd is based on s288c version  <dig>   <cit> . furthermore, the  <dig>  filtered snps identified using the maq software is consistent with the previously estimated  <dig>  snps for cen.pk113-7d based upon dna hybridization to 25mers olignonucleotide microarrays  <cit> . table  <dig> also presents the results for metabolic snp detection, where a total of  <dig> metabolic genes as defined by sgd were used to query for snps in both the s288c and cen.pk113-7d genome sequences. a total of  <dig> metabolic snpc of s288c,  <dig> of which are nonsynonymous, were identified across  <dig> independent metabolic genes . a significantly higher number of metabolic snps,  <dig>  were detected in cen.pk113-7d and distributed across  <dig> unique metabolic genes,  <dig> of which contained a total  <dig> nonsynonymous snps.

notes: base pairs .  filtered snps determined based on cut-off criteria within the mapping and assembling with quality  software environment.  detected snps with estimated error <  <dig> %  the total number of genes classified as metabolic was based on the saccharomyces genome database, strain s288c, version  <dig> . the "s288c" designation in table  <dig> refers to the resequencing of s. cerevisiae s288c using illumnia/solexa sequencing technology.

in an effort to characterize the nonsynonymous metabolic snps identified in cen.pk113-7d with biological significance, gene ontology  process categorization was performed and presented in figure  <dig> ranked according to statistical significance . the most significant categories include carboxylic acid, organic acid, and carbohydrate metabolism, followed by nitrogen, amino acid, lipid, aromatic compound, and glycoprotein metabolism. additional file  <dig> figure s <dig> presents the go function and component categorization, and as expected the highest significant concentration of nonsynonymous snps  distributed across a specific enzyme class is for transferases. notably, the background genes used for go enrichment analysis were the complete gene set available in sgd . go enrichment analysis uses a hypergeometric distribution with multiple hypothesis correct to calculate p-values and correct for multiple sampling.

a graphical representation of all silent and nonsynonymous snps mapped to their specific metabolic pathways is presented in additional file  <dig> figure s <dig>  figure  <dig> highlights two metabolic pathways, galactose uptake and ergosterol synthesis, where an enrichment of nonsynonymous and silent snps was observed. specifically, gal <dig>  gal <dig>  erg <dig>  and erg <dig> contained nonsynonymous snps, while gal <dig>  erg <dig> and hmg <dig> contained silent snps. the specific snps are identified as well the resulting amino acid substitutions.

in addition to identifying snp enriched metabolic pathways in cen.pk113-7d, an analysis intended to determine the prevalence of the snp across the top  <dig> homologous sequences resulting from a multi-alignment pfam query was performed. to better quantify those results, the parameters cen.pk match frequency, dominant aa frequency, s288c match frequency, and conservation distance were defined and calculated . the conservation distance, bound between - <dig> and  <dig>  is a measure of whether the snp identified in cen.pk113-7d is more prevalent amongst homologous pfam sequences , or if s288c  is more prevalent . additional file  <dig> figure s <dig> presents the conservation distance across nonsynonymous snps identified, with the average value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , indicating that there is virtually no bias between s288c or cen.pk113-7d as compared to their homologues. extending this approach further, each amino acid polymorphism was characterized across a multi-alignment pfam homologue search, and categorized according to standard amino acid properties . for example, figure  <dig> presents snps identified in erg <dig> at nucleotide positions  <dig> and  <dig>  the resulting amino acid partially encoded by position  <dig> was 75% polar, 25% non-polar, 25% hydrophobic, and 75% hydroxylic looking across the top  <dig> pfam homologous sequences. lastly, and of most relevance to understanding the amino acid functional changes resulting from a snp, the same categorization is presented for the s288c v. cen.pk113-7d sequence. for example, the snp at position  <dig> of erg <dig> resulted in changing the encoded amino acid from non-polar  to polar , and from hydrophobic  to hydroxylic . this approach is extended to all the erg <dig> nonsynonymous snps as an example of extending nucleotide level changes to amino acid functional changes . furthermore, additional file  <dig> figure s <dig> highlights functional changes for all metabolic nonsynonymous snps identified.

physiological characterization
the s. cerevisiae strains s288c and cen.pk113-7d were physiologically characterized in both batch glucose and galactose supplemented fermentations. on glucose, cen.pk113-7d exhibited a 32% higher specific growth rate than s288c, correlating with the 33% higher specific glucose consumption rate . the cen.pk113-7d extracellular metabolic specific productivity rates were  <dig> %, 392%, and  <dig> % higher for ethanol, acetate, and glycerol production compared to s288c, respectively, while the specific oxygen consumption rates were nearly equivalent . following complete glucose fermentation, as indicated by the peak carbon dioxide evolution rate , both strains underwent a diauxic shift, clearly identified by the transition of the respiratory quotient  from >  <dig> to <  <dig>  and ethanol accumulated during glucose fermentation  was respiro-fermented. the ethanol respiro-fermentation  phase  was clearly distinguishable in the cen.pk113-7d compared to s288c, where both cer and oxygen uptake rates  linearly increased, corresponding with the increase in biomass . on the contrary, during the erf phase for s288c there was a growth deficiency, clearly indicated by non-linear and significantly reduced cer and our rates, corresponding with a much lower increase in biomass . the significantly decreased erf phase in s288c compared to cen.pk113-7d is also evident from the total time required to exhaust the ethanol .

notes: a. . the term "n/a" refers to not applicable.

a similar characterization was performed using batch galactose supplemented fermentations. cen.pk113-7d demonstrated a slight lag-phase compared to glucose fermentation; however, sustained a galactose specific growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> and galactose uptake rate of  <dig>  c-mmol g-dcw- <dig> h- <dig>  representing a 34% and 77% reduction, respectively, compared to glucose . all extracellular metabolic specific productivity rates were significantly decreased , with the exception of our, which was 47% higher on galactose compared to glucose, leading to an effectively lower rq of  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  during glucose cultivation. furthermore, given the significantly lower rq during the exponential phase of galactose fermentation, relatively little ethanol was produced , resulting in a short erf phase  . similarly, s288c was cultivated on galactose; however, a significant deficiency in the strain's ability to metabolize this carbon source was observed. a total of  <dig> h post-inoculation elapsed with no increase in biomass as compared to cen.pk113-7d where after  <dig> h post-inoculation two cell doublings were observed. at  <dig> h post-inoculation a glucose bolus of  <dig> g l- <dig> was added to promote growth, and rapidly, glucose fermentation, a diauxic shift, and ethanol respiro-fermentation were observed . both co-consumption of galactose and ethanol, and a galactose only respiro-fermentative  growth phase were observed. during co-consumption the specific growth rate was  <dig>  h- <dig>  while on galactose only the specific growth rate was  <dig>  h- <dig>  similarly, the extracellular specific metabolite productivity rates were nearly zero when only galactose consumption was considered . ethanol was consumed by  <dig> h post-inoculation, and in the period from  <dig> h to  <dig> h, only galactose consumption was observed, and biomass increased from  <dig>  g-dcwl l- <dig> to  <dig>  g-dcw l- <dig>  representing a doubling time of  <dig> h compared to  <dig>  h for cen.pk113-7d.

for each cultivation condition and strain, ergosterol measurements were performed and presented in figure  <dig>  at the same time of transcriptome sampling, which occurred during mid-exponential phase of glucose fermentation , a total ergosterol of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg g-dcw- <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg g-dcw- <dig> for cen.pk113-7d and s288c, respectively, was measured. subsequently, the diauxic shift and erf phase was characterized by two ergosterol samples during early and mid-erf phase, and followed by a final  sample post-ethanol exhaustion. s288c ergosterol content was significantly higher during ethanol metabolism as compared to cen.pk113-7d, but post-ethanol metabolism cen.pk113-7d exhibited a significantly higher ergosterol content  as observed during glucose fermentation. for galactose cultivations, ergosterol content was only measured during transcriptome sampling, which occurred at  <dig> h for s288c , and  <dig> h for cen.pk113-7d. the total ergosterol content on galactose was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg g-dcw- <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg g-dcw- <dig> for cen.pk113-7d and s288c, respectively.

transcriptome characterization
differential gene expression between s288c and cen.pk113-7d, cultivated on both glucose and galactose, is summarized in table  <dig>  the go characterization  for the comparative conditions s288c v. cen.pk113-7d cultivated on glucose, and s288c v. cen.pk113-7d cultivated on galactose, and divided into log2-fold change  >  <dig> and <  <dig>  is presented in additional file  <dig> figure s <dig> and figure s <dig>  the metabolic pathway expression maps for each comparative condition are included in additional file  <dig> figure s <dig> and figure s <dig>  lastly, all genes exhibiting statistically significant differential gene expression  and having either a silent or nonsynonymous snp are included in additional file  <dig> table s <dig> and table s <dig> 

notes: single nucleotide polymorphism . standard deviation . nonsynonymous snps defined as a nucleotide modification results in a translated amino acid modification.

for the condition s288c v. cen.pk113-7d cultivated on glucose, the top  <dig> differentially expressed genes, ranked according to padj value are characterized into go process terms largely dominated by responses to stimuli and pheromone, with the dominant metabolic process categories being trehalose metabolism, steroid metabolism, and amino acid transport. specific genes consistent with this categorization high in padj value rank and lfc >  <dig> are gsy <dig>  and for lfc <  <dig> is hmg <dig> . for the condition s288c v. cen.pk113-7d cultivated on galactose, the top  <dig> differentially expressed genes, ranked according to padj value are characterized into go process terms response to simuli and stress, carbohydrate metabolism, and transport. specific metabolic genes noteworthy in this category, high in padj value rank amongst genes with lfc >  <dig> include mdh <dig> , fbp <dig> , gad <dig> , gdh <dig>  gsy <dig> , and icl <dig> . similarly, specific metabolic genes high in padj value rank amongst genes with lfc <  <dig> include are <dig> , and cyb <dig> .

in an effort to further investigate if larger regulatory mechanisms could be identified the list of genes exhibiting significant differential expression were submitted to the yeast search for transcriptional regulators and consensus tracking  curated repository of associations between transcription factors and target genes in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . the transcription factor, tec1p, was identified as directly regulating  <dig> % of the total submitted gene list , and was  <dig> -fold higher expressed in cen.pk113-7d compared to s288c . tec1p was the only identified transcription factor to be significantly differentially expressed, and strongly regulates flo <dig>  a flocculin gene required for invasive growth, and pseudohyphal formation  <cit> . the transcription factors regulating the highest percentage of the differentially expressed genes, yet not being differentially expressed themselves, were sok2p and ste12p, with  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, of submitted genes being directly regulated. sok2p and ste12p are transcription factors negatively regulating pseudohyphal differentiation  <cit> . a similar analysis was performed for galactose; however, similar results were obtained, with sok2p and ste12p directly regulating  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes . the transcription factors differentially expressed themselves were msa1p  and msa2p , putative g1-specific cell cycle transcription activators, and usv1p, a putative zinc finger transcription factor regulating growth on non-fermentable carbon sources. usv <dig> expression was  <dig> -fold higher in cen.pk113-7d compared to s288c . although relatively little is known about usv1p, it has been shown to be induced post-diauxic shift, consistent with the deficiency in post-diauxic shift metabolism observed in s288c  <cit> . with the exception of usv1p, all transcription factors identified are more closely related to the significant difference in growth rates between strains rather than their respiro-fermentative metabolism. metabolic snps identified and subsequent analysis did not identify clear correlations or pathway enrichment that could explain the lack of respiro-fermentative metabolism in s288c. metabolic genes containing nonsynonymous snps in cen.pk113-7d, significantly differentially expressed on galactose, and related to oxidative metabolism included acs <dig> , gad <dig> , yat <dig> , and ccp <dig>  which were  <dig> -fold,  <dig> -fold,  <dig> -fold, and  <dig> -fold higher in cen.pk113-7d, respectively .

discussion
the physiological characterization clearly suggests that s288c has a deficiency in metabolism of respiro-fermentative carbon sources, such as ethanol and galactose, when compared to cen.pk113-7d. inspection of the significantly differentially expressed genes between strains cultivated on glucose or galactose did not reveal an obvious gene cluster that would explain this significant physiological difference. this is supported both by the go characterization and pathway expression mapping.

there were two central carbon metabolic pathways enriched with nonsynonymous snps that also correlated with significant differences in phenotype. s. cerevisiae cen.pk113-7d exhibited significantly higher ergosterol content during growth on glucose, and to a lesser extent, galactose. this is consistent with previous work where cen.pk2-1c had very high ergosterol/erg-ester  and triacylglycerols content  compared to  <dig> other s. cerevisiae strains, including fy <dig>  which is isogenic to s288c  <cit> . the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway had significant nonsynonymous snps identified in erg <dig> and erg <dig>  and silent snps identified in erg <dig> and hmg <dig>  both erg <dig> and erg <dig> were not significantly differentially expressed, either in glucose or galactose, suggestive again that phenotypic observations, consistent with genome sequence variations, are not necessarily directly manifested at the transcriptome level. both erg <dig>  and erg <dig>  are essential cytosolic enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of isoprenoids and sterols , including ergosterol, from mevalonate  <cit> . the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway is highly regulated through feedback inhibition mechanisms and by several rate-controlling steps, including that catalyzed by hmg-coa reductase, encoded by hmg <dig>  <cit> . under both glucose and galactose, hmg <dig> expression was significantly down-regulated in s288c compared to cen.pk113-7d by  <dig> -fold  and  <dig> -fold , respectively, correlating with the significantly less ergosterol content in s288c cultivated on glucose and to a lesser extent, on galactose. furthermore, erg <dig> has been previously identified as also having a regulatory role  <cit> , consistent with the hypothesis that a nonsynonymous snp resulting in altered protein function could affect ergosterol synthesis. erg <dig> on the other hand has not been explicitly shown to have a regulatory function, yet, when the specific activity of  <dig>  μmol min- <dig> mg- <dig> is compared to other ergosterol synthetic enzymes such as erg <dig> , erg <dig> , erg <dig> , and especially the known regulator hmg1/hmg <dig> , it is suggestive that erg <dig> is likely a rate limiting step  <cit> . there were a large number of nonsynonymous snps that encoded significant changes in amino acid classes, further suggestive that erg <dig> is a strong metabolic engineering target for understanding the significantly higher ergosterol content in cen.pk113-7d. lastly, the observation that neither erg <dig> nor erg <dig> were differentially expressed under glucose or galactose, suggests their potential affect on phenotype is likely post-translational.

similar to ergosterol biosynthesis, the galactose uptake pathway phenotype in s288c was vastly lower rate compared to cen.pk113-7d, correlating with the nonsynonymous snp enrichment in gal <dig> and gal <dig>  and silent snps in gal <dig>  neither gal <dig>  nor gal <dig>  were significantly differentially expressed during growth on galactose; however, on glucose gal <dig> was significantly up-regulated ,  <dig> -fold in cen.pk113-7d. both Δgal <dig> and Δgal <dig> mutants are unable to grow on galactose as sole carbon sources  <cit> . the significant number of nonsynonymous snps in both essential galactose genes suggests obvious targets for explanation of why s288c is incapable of galactose respiro-fermentative metabolism. furthermore, it should be noted that s288c has been described as Δgal <dig> , which may be ascribed to the presence of  <dig> snps between cen.pk113-7d and s288c in the coding region, and  <dig> snps in the upstream region that result in a poor functional gal2p. however, clearly, s288c is able to co-metabolize galactose with ethanol and this may be ascribed by galactose transport by e.g. the hexose transporters.

a further metabolic engineering benefit of whole genome sequencing was the detection of a nonsynonymous snp resulting in a stop codon of pad <dig> . pad1p is essential for decarboxylation of aromatic carboxylic acids conferring resistance to cinnamic acid, and a nonsynonymous snp was detected at nucleotide position  <dig> , resulting in a stop codon   <cit> . although pad <dig> relevant phenotypes were not explored, the transcriptome response on glucose revealed significant differential expression of pad <dig> , with  <dig> -fold higher expression in s288c compared to cen.pk113-7d. this is consistent with the stop codon detected in cen.pk113-7d at position  <dig>  noting that the total orf genomic dna sequence is  <dig> nucleotides, and therefore unlikely to be transcribed and detected.

CONCLUSIONS
whole high-throughput genome sequencing of s. cerevisiae s288c and cen.pk113-7d resulted in identification of  <dig>  filtered snps in cen.pk113-7d, with a total of  <dig> snps detected across  <dig> unique metabolic genes,  <dig> of which contained a total of  <dig> nonsynonymous snps. there were two central carbon metabolic pathways enriched with nonsynonymous snps that also correlated with significant differences in phenotype. s. cerevisiae cen.pk113-7d exhibited significantly higher ergosterol content during growth on glucose, and to a lesser extent, galactose. the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway had significant nonsynonymous snps identified in erg <dig> and erg <dig>  and silent snps identified in erg <dig> and hmg <dig>  the flux through the galactose uptake pathway was much lower in s288c compared with cen.pk113-7d, correlating with the nonsynonymous snp enrichment in gal <dig> and gal <dig>  and silent snps in gal <dig>  more globally, the physiological characterization clearly suggests that s288c has a deficiency in metabolism of respiratory carbon sources, such as ethanol and galactose, when compared to cen.pk113-7d. inspection of the significantly differentially expressed genes between strains cultivated on glucose or galactose did not reveal an obvious gene cluster that would explain this significant physiological difference. in summary and perhaps not surprisingly, transcriptome analysis did not provide a clear hypothesis for major phenotypes observed, suggesting that genotype to phenotype correlations are manifested post-transcriptionally or post-translationally either through protein concentration and/or function. clearly, future work must validate these correlations through genetic engineering of identified snps in either s288c or cen.pk113-7d to see if desired phenotypes, such as increased galactose uptake or ergosterol synthesis in s288c, are observed. future work must also expand on the metabolic snp analysis presented to include all  <dig>  snps, realizing phenotypic observations may not necessarily be linked directly to metabolic snps, but rather snps affecting larger regulatory mechanisms and networks, such as those governed by transcription factors. certainly, as s. cerevisiae continues to be exploited, particularly for metabolic engineering applications, the integration of physiological characterization, transcriptome analysis, and metabolic snp detection with high-throughput whole genome sequencing provides direct correlations between observed phenotypes and genotypes and offers high probability of success metabolic targets.
