BACKGROUND
the free fatty acid receptors  belong to group a of the g protein-coupled receptor  family and are activated endogenously by free fatty acids of different chain lengths with varying levels of specificity  <cit> . the free fatty acid receptor  <dig> , previously known as gpr <dig>  has a preference to bind the long-chain fatty acids with more than  <dig> carbon atoms  <cit> . the free fatty acid receptor  <dig> , previously known as gpr <dig>  and the free fatty acid receptor  <dig> , known as gpr <dig>  respond to short-chain fatty acids that have less than  <dig> carbon atoms  <cit> . ffas have more than 30 % sequence identity.

the recent discovery of ffas involvement in glucose and lipid homeostasis, adiposity and inflammation has raised great interest to find small molecule ligands modulating the function of these receptors and probe them in the treatment of various metabolic and inflammatory conditions including obesity, type  <dig> diabetes, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, ulcerative colitis, crohn’s disease and irritable bowel disease .

several ffa <dig> agonists including gw <dig>  tak-875/fasiglifam, amg- <dig>  am <dig>  am <dig> , ly <dig>  jtt- <dig> and p <dig> were developed by industry using high-throughput screening and subsequent medicinal chemistry. some of these agonists were tested in clinical trials but removed due to toxicity  <cit> . small selective ffa2/ffa <dig> carboxylic acids derived from the endogenous fatty acids  have been developed as ffa2/ffa <dig> agonists by academia, though with poor potency  <cit> . a series of synthetic agonists has been patented by euroscreen with potency up to 13nm  <cit> . amg <dig>  also referred to as 4-cmtb, is a ffa <dig> selective allosteric agonist  that was discovered by amgen to inhibit lipolysis  <cit> , yet, unfavourable pharmacokinetic properties of amg <dig> prevented this compound from progressing to clinical trials  <cit> . no highly potent orthosteric agonists have been developed at ffa <dig> to date. a series of ffa <dig> selective molecules, for example  <dig>  was reported by arena pharmaceuticals to act as positive or negative allosteric modulators  <cit> . it is evident that a few available ligands of ffas have various limitations for clinical tests and the development of novel ffa ligands presenting drug-like properties is an emerging challenge to validate the role of ffas modulation in the therapy of metabolic and immune disorders.fig.  <dig> agonists of the free fatty acid 1– <dig> receptors. the potency of compounds was taken from ref.  <dig>   <dig> and 13



understanding the structural basis of ligand binding at ffas would benefit discovery of potent and selective small molecule modulators. until recently, homology modelling in conjunction with mutagenesis has been used in non-direct identification of ligand interactions in ffas  <cit> . the structure-based approach using the validated ffa <dig> homology model together with ligand-based approaches have been probed in in silico search of orthosteric binders  <cit> . however, the crystal structure of ffa <dig> in complex with the ago-allosteric ligand, tak- <dig> has been recently published  <cit> , providing the first direct information of ligand binding at ffa <dig>  in this work we first compare previous homology models of ffa <dig>  <cit>  with the ffa <dig> crystallographic structure and use the experimental structure for docking of orthosteric and allosteric agonists to further delineate the agonist binding mode at ffa <dig>  we next use the ffa <dig> structure to build novel homology models of ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> and compare the agonist binding site of the receptor subtypes. throughout the study we link novel structural models of ffas with available mutagenesis and structure-activity relationships  data. our work extends the application of the recent ffa <dig> crystal structure, further predicts agonist binding regions at ffas and suggests amino acid residues for mutagenesis to verify their role in binding of orthosteric and allosteric agonists. our work provides general suggestions in modelling of distantly related gpcrs.

free fatty acid receptor 1
structural models
we evaluate the earlier homology models of ffa <dig> built by tikhonova et al.  <cit>  and sum, et al.  <cit>  based on rhodopsin and β <dig> adrenergic  receptor crystal structures, templates with 16 % sequence identity to model the ligand binding site with the ffa <dig> crystal structure. in addition, the homology model based on the protease-activated receptor  <dig>  crystal structure  <cit> , the available template with the highest sequence identity, 26 % is constructed and included to the analysis. the backbone superimposition of helices of the crystal structure and homology models is shown in fig.  <dig>  the root-mean-square deviation  value for the helix backbone is  <dig>  Å for the rhodopsin-based and  <dig>  Å for β2- and par <dig> -based ffa <dig> homology models. in the upper side of the helical bundle forming the ligand binding site a significant deviation is observed for helices  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with a backbone rmsd of 2– <dig>  Å.fig.  <dig> the superimposition of the ffa <dig> crystal structure and homology models base on the backbone of the helices in the extracellular side. the crystal structure, rhodopsin, β <dig> adrenergic and par1-based homology models are in yellow, cyan, pink and grey colour, respectively. residues predicted to be important for ligand coordination based on mutagenesis and residue k <dig> , representing the possible anchoring point for allosteric ligands are shown in stick-like representation. the green arrows indicate the large movement of helices  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the ffa <dig> crystal structure compared to the homology models



the earlier ffa <dig> homology models and mutagenesis  <cit>  have predicted that an agonist binding site is located between helices  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  involving ay <dig> , h <dig> , r <dig> , l <dig> , y <dig> , n <dig>  and r <dig>   <cit>  . the position and orientation of y <dig> , n <dig>  and r <dig>  are similar between modelled and crystal structures with a rmsd approaching  <dig>  Å. in contrast, the rmsd of y <dig> , h <dig> , r <dig>  and l <dig>  has a larger value of 2– <dig> Å. in the homology models, y <dig>  is more pointed toward helices  <dig> and  <dig>  whereas it faces helix  <dig> forming interactions with y <dig>  in the crystal structure. we noted that helix  <dig> in ffa <dig> has a proline kink at position  <dig>  causing a slightly outward position of the helix in the crystal structure, which appears to create space for y <dig>  to orientate toward and interact with y <dig>  .

h <dig>  is pointed inside the helical bundle in the rhodopsin and par <dig> -based models, whereas it is more outside in the crystal structure. as noted by srivastava et al.  <cit>  helix  <dig> in ffa <dig> has glycine at position  <dig>  and does not contain the frequently conserved proline at position  <dig> , providing some flexibility to the upper part of helix  <dig>  and thus explaining the different position of h <dig> .

r <dig>  and l <dig>  are similarly oriented inside the helical bundle in the modelled and crystal structures but there is a  <dig> Å shift in the backbone position of these residues, the result of a more inward position of helix  <dig> in the ffa <dig> crystal structure . this brings r <dig>  closer to r <dig>  allowing charge pairing of guanidium side chains. none of built homology models had these interactions.

the network of interactions involving two arginines and two tyrosines in the ffa <dig> crystal structure closes the access to the deeper cavity at ffa <dig>  whereas the absence of this network of interactions in the homology models provides a large cavity between helices  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . this difference has a major impact on ligand orientation in the modelled and crystal structures.

in the crystal structure the carboxyl group of tak- <dig> forms direct interactions with r <dig> , r <dig> , y <dig>  and y <dig>  through h-bonding  <cit>  . although homology modelling in conjunction with mutagenesis predicted direct interactions with these residues for linoleic acid, gw <dig> and tak- <dig>  interactions with y <dig>  and y <dig>  were predicted through aromatic and hydrophobic contacts   <cit> . the deep cavity inside the helical bundle  in the earlier homology models locks agonists within the helical bundle allowing the hydrophobic tail of the ligand to interact with the tyrosines. in this position, gw <dig> was predicted to form aromatic and amino-aromatic interactions with h <dig>  and hydrophobic interactions with l <dig>  . these interactions are not observed with tak- <dig>  h <dig>  and l <dig>  are at the distance of > <dig> Å from tak- <dig> in the crystal structure. instead, the hydrophobic part of tak- <dig> interacts with f <dig> , f <dig> , w174el <dig> and l <dig>  and is pointed between helices  <dig> and  <dig> facing lipids in the experimental structure . this docking position could not have been predicted in the homology models as the space between helices  <dig> and  <dig> is  <dig> Å narrower and residues f <dig>  and l <dig>  create an obstacle to the interhelical space. in contrast, docking is to some extent biased to the cavity formed by helices  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as the hydrophobic moiety of ligands in the crystal structures of rhodopsin and the β <dig> receptor is in this location. docking to the ffa <dig> homology model based on the par <dig> receptor crystal structure predicts a different position for the hydrophobic part of an agonist compared to the rhodopsin- and β <dig> -based templates. thus, the hydrophobic tail of the ligand is between helices  <dig> and  <dig> with the possibility of interacting with lipids . this orientation is also similar to the position of the ligand in the par <dig> receptor crystal structure. clearly, the choice of a template for homology modelling is critical for establishing the size and shape of the binding cavity which, in turn, influences ligand docking solutions.fig.  <dig> the ligand binding mode at the ffa <dig> crystal structure and homology models. a: the binding model of tak- <dig>  the ago-allosteric ligand in the ffa <dig> crystal structure, the ligand is pointed between helices  <dig> and  <dig> . b: the binding mode of gw <dig>  the high potency agonist in the previous rhodopsin-based homology model of ffa <dig>  the model was obtained from ref  <dig>  c: the binding mode of tak- <dig> in the par1-based model of ffa <dig>  hydrogen bonds are in black



the second extracellular loop  was challenging to model due to the absence of any sequence similarity with the available templates, though modelling has predicted h-bonding between e172el <dig> and r <dig>  correctly   <cit> . e145el <dig> has been anticipated to be important in receptor activation by interacting with r <dig>  in the homology models  <cit>  but has h-bonding with s178el <dig> in the crystal structure .

in the crystal structure no water molecules are present in the tak- <dig> binding cavity, however there are water molecules that are involved in the h-bond network of interactions with the residues of the ffa <dig> binding cavity. a water molecule  forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond network of interactions with n <dig> , r <dig>  and s <dig>  . the residue n <dig>  predicted to be important for agonist binding through hydrogen bonding in the earlier models contributes to agonist binding indirectly via coordinating anchoring arginines. in addition, several water molecules connect el <dig> and helices  <dig> and  <dig> via interactions with w <dig> el <dig>  e <dig> el <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig>  . the site map search predicts the binding cavity within this area .

we noted that k <dig>  faces the binding cavity in the ffa <dig> crystal structure , similar to the corresponding residue in the peptide , lysosphingolipid  and nucleotide  receptor crystal structures, whereas it is at front of the lipid side in the earlier homology models. the location of a residue at position  <dig>  in the binding site is due to proline at position  <dig>  that causes the kink altering the packing of neighbouring residues. the role of k <dig> , an additional positively charged residue in the binding cavity of ffa <dig> is unknown and mutation of this residue could be of a great interest to explore its role in ligand binding. it is tempting to suggest that k <dig>  could be involved in interacting with allosteric modulators, thus the site map search suggests the binding cavity near k <dig>  .

in summary, the low-resolution homology models were helpful in establishing the location of the ligand binding site within helices  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and the key residues for ligand anchoring. however, homology models were not accurate in predicting the nature of all ligand-receptor contacts and the precise ligand-binding mode. it appears that the position of helices  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> affects docking solutions. it should be noted that the crystal structure of ffa <dig> is only available in the complex with the ago-allosteric ligand, which is assumed to bind in the overlapping region of the allosteric and orthosteric binding sites, thus binding of orthosteric agonists could be distinct from tak- <dig> binding.

ligand docking
because the crystal structure of ffa <dig> is available only in a complex with tak- <dig> we next explore docking of a linoleic acid and synthetic agonists in the experimental ffa <dig> structure. initially, we validate a docking protocol of the glide program  <cit>  by re-docking tak- <dig> to the crystal structure to examine whether it can reproduce the experimental binding pose of tak- <dig>  in all generated poses, the glide standard docking protocol  <cit>  has reproduced the position of tak- <dig> close to the crystal structure position with a rmsd value of  <dig>  Å. notably, alanine at position  <dig>  in the crystal structure  is a mutation being used together with l42a, g103a and y202f to thermostabilise the protein  <cit> . the alanine is located ~ <dig> Å from tak- <dig>  whereas phenylalanine at this position in the wild type could be at distance of  <dig> Å. given its potential impact on a ligand position we rebuilt the wild type of ffa <dig> and docked tak- <dig> .fig.  <dig> the superimposition of the ffa <dig> crystal structure and the homology model of the ffa <dig> wild type bound to tak- <dig>  the ffa <dig> wild type model was constructed from the ffa <dig> crystal structure using prime  <cit> . tak- <dig> was docked to the wild type model using glide  <cit> . phenylalanine mutation at position  <dig>  is shown in pink



the ligand is docked in the similar orientation but with the higher rmsd of  <dig> Å, mainly for the biphenyl tail. to achieve this result, the docking protocol with van der waals radius of protein atoms soften from  <dig> to  <dig>  Å was used. we anticipate that mutation at position  <dig>  in the crystal structure could correct the agonist position. it appears this change however is not dramatic for the tak- <dig> binding affinity  <cit> . linoleic acid and gw <dig> were placed similar to tak- <dig> in the binding site. the docking position of gw <dig>  as an example is shown in fig. 5a.fig.  <dig> two proposed binding modes for the gw <dig> agonist in ffa <dig>  a: mode  <dig>  similar to the binding of tak- <dig> in the ffa <dig> crystal structure. b: mode  <dig>  the alternative pose derived from flexible docking. hydrogen bonds, π- π and π-cation interactions are in black and blue, respectively. the binding site residues, e <dig> and e <dig> of the second extracellular loop predicted to form salt bridges in the earlier models and k <dig>  predicted here to form the allosteric binding site are shown



to account for flexibility of side chains in the binding site we use the inducedfit docking protocol  <cit> , where initial ligand docking is followed by side-chain sampling and final re-docking into newly-generated receptor conformations. interestingly, we found that tak- <dig>  linoleic acid and gw <dig> have two binding modes in one of which the hydrophobic tail of the agonists, similar to the co-crystalized tak- <dig>  is pointed in the space between helices  <dig> and  <dig>  , whereas in another one the hydrophobic tail of the agonists is pointed in the space between helices  <dig> and  <dig> , fig. 5b. short simulations of the agonist-receptor complexes show that the ligands maintain stably the binding mode obtained in docking studies. in both modes of binding, the carboxyl group of ligands forms h-bonding with two arginines and two tyrosines. in mode  <dig>  gw <dig> is able to form aromatic and hydrophobic interactions with h <dig>  and l <dig>  predicted to be important in the earlier homology models. thus, phe and ala mutations of h <dig>  reduce the potency of gw <dig> by 28- and 100-fold, respectively  <cit> . phe mutation of l <dig>  lowers the potency of gw <dig> by 30-fold  <cit> . our docking experiments show that this binding mode dominates in the ffa <dig> wild type.

to further explore the induced fit, we conducted conformational search of the ffa <dig> binding site residues of the crystal structure without a ligand and found the side chain of f <dig> , f <dig> , l <dig>  and w174el <dig> residues closing the interhelical space of helices  <dig> and  <dig> in many generated conformations . notably, glide and inducedfit docking to these receptor conformations gives mode  <dig> as a favourable solution. based on our flexible docking experiments we hypothesize the possibility of an alternative binding mode for orthosteric agonists.

next, we explored glide and inducedfit docking of other agonists - tug- <dig>  <cit> , amg <dig>  am <dig> and am <dig>  <cit>  of ffa <dig>  tug- <dig> is a highly potent agonist demonstrating profound effects on glucose tolerance in mice  <cit> . amg <dig> is a partial agonist, whereas am <dig> and am <dig> are full agonists; all three appear to elicit activation through distinct binding sites  <cit> .

our docking results show different docking preferences. mode  <dig> in glide docking could be obtained with low energy only for amg <dig> . the inducedfit docking predicts both modes of binding with some preference toward mode  <dig> for am <dig> and tug- <dig> . the different preference in docking modes could provide some structural insight into a distinct response of amg <dig> and am <dig> to mutation of arginines at positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  in pharmacological studies  <cit> . mode  <dig> for tug- <dig> could be helpful in interpretation of the sar studies, indicating the preference of meta- over ortho- position of a substituent in the terminal ring. this is because in this mode the ligand with the meta-group has an extra interaction with h <dig>  . the bulky am <dig> compound  could not be docked in the specified docking site involving two arginines and two tyrosines. indeed am <dig> is unaffected by arginine mutations  <cit>  in pharmacological assays. we hypothesise here that am <dig> could bind to the binding site of the receptor involving k <dig> .

to further validate the ligand binding modes at ffa <dig>  mutagenesis of the residues lining the interhelical space of helices  <dig> and  <dig> as well as helices  <dig> and  <dig> will be beneficial. thus, the receptor with single or multiple mutations could be constructed, where the replacement is made to bulky residues or residues with opposite physicochemical property to prevent binding to one of the regions. analysis of such receptor mutants on a panel of agonists with similar and different chemical scaffolds as well as pharmacological properties  may decipher precise binding modes of agonists chemically distinct from the co-crystallized tak- <dig> 

from docking to the ffa <dig> crystal structure we predict the alternative ligand binding mode at the interhelical space between helices  <dig> and  <dig>  which could accommodate the orthosteric agonists. this binding mode can explain mutagenesis results for h <dig>  and l <dig>   <cit> .

free fatty acid receptors  <dig> and 3
structural models
the sequence identity of the ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> helical bundle with ffa <dig> is 32 % and 33 %, respectively, which is less than the sequence identity between the subtypes of the adrenergic, muscarinic and opioid receptors , suggesting more structural differences between the ffa receptor subtypes. the sequence identity is higher between ffa <dig> and ffa <dig>  49 %. sequence alignment of the ffa receptors is in figure 6s .

among other currently available gpcr templates for homology modeling , the highest sequence identity of ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> within the transmembrane helices is with the purinergic p2y <dig> receptor for ffa <dig>  and the par <dig> receptor for ffa <dig> . the first models of ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> to study the ligand-receptor interactions were constructed using the β <dig> receptor crystal structure with the sequence identity of 17 %  <cit> . we here evaluate the ffa1-based template in modeling of the ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> binding site and ligand-receptor interactions.

examination of the sequence alignment shows that unlike ffa <dig> helices  <dig> and  <dig> in ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> don’t have proline and glycine in the upper side, indicating possible variation of the helix position from ffa <dig> 

similar to ffa <dig>  residue mutagenesis at ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> shows that the conserved arginines at positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  and histidine at position  <dig>  are important for coordinating the binding of short chain fatty acids at ffa <dig> and ffa <dig>  <cit> . unlike other  <dig> available templates for homology modelling , the ffa <dig> template provides a favorable starting position of the lengthy arginines in the ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> homology models for ligand docking. manual side chain adjustments to bring the arginine residues together for the interaction with the carboxyl group of a ligand are needed when using other templates. figure 8s  shows the superimposition of ffa <dig> homology models built using  <dig> gpcrs with available crystal structures, with the visualized arginine residues to appreciate various positions of the arginine side chain. it is therefore expected that the ffa1-based homology models will be more suitable for characterizing the ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> binding site compared to the p2y <dig> and par <dig> –based homology models.

comparison of ffa <dig> with ffa <dig> structure reveals a more intensive network of interactions within the ffa <dig> binding site due to extra hydrophilic and aromatic residues . thus, y165el <dig> in ffa <dig>  and y <dig>   contribute to aromatic and h-bond networks of interactions with conserved y <dig> , r <dig> , y <dig>  and r <dig> . residue h <dig>   forms an h-bond with r <dig>  and aromatic and hydrophobic interactions with y <dig>  and y <dig> . in addition, residues k <dig> , e <dig>  and e166el <dig> contribute to an h-bonding network within the binding site. the major difference with the previous ffa <dig> homology models  <cit>  is that we didn’t observe this intensive network of hydrogen bond and aromatic interactions. the higher quality ffa <dig> homology model suggests that the binding site is more packed and less opened from the extracellular side.fig.  <dig> the ligand binding site of the free fatty acid 1– <dig> receptors a: the binding site in the ffa <dig> crystal structure; b and c: the binding site in the ffa1-based homology model of ffa <dig> and ffa <dig>  respectively. the side chain of the binding site residues in ffas is shown in blue, pink and green, respectively. h-bonding, π- π and π-cation interactions are shown in black, blue and green dotted lines, respectively



the interhelical space between helices  <dig> and  <dig> is less accessible in ffa <dig> compared to ffa <dig> as it is filled by residues f <dig>  , i <dig>   and f <dig>  . in addition, s <dig>   and c <dig>   are in very close proximity to form an h-bond, further closing the hole between helices. non-conserved residues such as v <dig>  , v <dig>   and f168el <dig>  also change the entry to the interhelical space between helices  <dig> and  <dig> in ffa <dig>  overall, the binding cavity is smaller in ffa <dig>  than in ffa <dig>  , providing a geometrical reason to a preference in binding of short  over medium  and long chain  ffas.table  <dig> properties of the binding cavity formed by helices 3–7

sasa is the solvent accessible surface area of the residues forming the binding cavity, sasa with subscript: phil, phob, aliph and arom is sasa of the hydrophilic, hydrophobic, aliphatic or aromatic residues, respectively



similar to ffa <dig>  the interhelical space between helices  <dig> and  <dig> is less opened in ffa <dig> due to non-conserved residues, f <dig>  and y <dig> , filling the interhelical space . compared to ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> the h-bonding network at ffa <dig> including residues at positions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  has a different arrangement likely as a result of the non-conserved residues l171el <dig>  and phe at position  <dig>   that are unable to form h-bonding. overall, smaller number of h-bonds is observed in ffa <dig> compared to ffa <dig>  the binding cavity in ffa <dig> is larger  compared to ffa <dig> but smaller than in ffa <dig> . the new models suggest that y165el <dig> in ffa <dig> and y170el <dig> in ffa <dig>  which corresponds to l <dig> el <dig> in ffa <dig> are located in the center of the ffa orthosteric site and contributes to reduction of the volume in ffa <dig> and ffa <dig>  playing likely an important role in subtype selectivity between ffa <dig> and ffa2- <dig> 

we characterize the physicochemical properties of the ligand binding sites at ffas by calculating the solvent accessible surface area  of the hydrophilic, hydrophobic, aromatic and aliphatic residues of the binding cavity at ffas . as expected, the sasa of the hydrophobic residues is significantly higher compared to the sasa of the hydrophilic residues in all the receptors. the higher percent of hydrophilicity is in ffa <dig>  compared to ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> . the sasa of aromatic residues has the higher value for ffa <dig>   <dig> Å <dig>  whereas it is  <dig> and  <dig> Å <dig> in ffa <dig> and ffa <dig>  respectively. the sasa of aliphatic residues has the higher value for ffa <dig>   <dig> Å <dig> compared to  <dig> and  <dig> Å <dig> in ffa <dig> and ffa <dig>  respectively. it appears that several distinct binding regions within the binding cavities of ffas could be mapped that were not so clear in the earlier models.

the el <dig> of ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> is six- residues shorter than the el <dig> of ffa <dig>  there is some similarity in the el <dig> sequence after the disulfide bridged cysteine. the el <dig> sequence identity is higher between ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> . compared to other available templates, the el <dig> of ffa <dig> is the most suitable template for el <dig> modeling of ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> 

residues l173el <dig>  y165el <dig> and e166el <dig> of ffa <dig>  known to be important for agonist binding from mutagenesis  <cit>  face the binding cavity in the new ffa <dig> model and likely contribute to agonist binding through a network of interactions with a ligand or residues of the helices. the residue q148el <dig>  gives substantial loss in the potency of  <dig>  in ffa <dig> when it is mutated to glutamate and contributes to ligand selectivity in the pharmacological studies  <cit> . the new ffa <dig> model suggests that q148el <dig> is situated outside of the binding site and contributes to ligand binding likely indirectly through potential h-bonding with nearby d170el <dig> or d174el <dig> . the glutamate substitution of q148el <dig>  <cit>  might therefore lead to repulsion and subsequent change in the el <dig> conformation, which can affect the ligand binding. d170el <dig> and d174el <dig> are non-conserved in ffas and could be of interest for mutagenesis. the conformation of el <dig> in ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> cannot suggest a possible ionic salt bridge of g159eel <dig> mutation in ffa <dig> or d158el <dig> in ffa <dig>  with one of the arginines of the binding site, holding the receptor in the inactive state, as it was proposed for interpretation of the reduced constitutive activity of the receptors in functional essays  <cit> . these residues are far away from arginines in the new structural models of the receptors. it should be noted that the low similarity of the el <dig> sequence in this region with ffa <dig> does not allow to model a precise position and interactions of q148el <dig> in ffa <dig> and g <dig> el <dig> in ffa <dig> 

overall, the new homology models reveal the role of non-conserved residues in defining a distinct network of interactions in the ligand binding cavity of ffas, which appears to be influential for ffa subtype selectivity.

ligand docking
docking of the selective short carboxylic acids  <cit> , ffa2-selective tiglic acid and ffa3-selective 1-mcpc to the ffa1-based model of ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> indicates that the carboxyl group of the fatty acids is anchored by conserved r <dig> , r <dig> , y <dig>  and y <dig> . the non-conserved residues at positions  <dig>  and e166/l171el <dig> predicted to be important for ffa2/ffa <dig> selectivity together with the residue at position  <dig>  in the earlier homology models contribute more to the shape of the binding cavity rather than direct interactions with a ligand . instead, the non-conserved residue at position  <dig>  is at distance of  <dig> Å enabling it to form van der waals interactions. the hydrophobic part of the tiglic acid forms hydrophobic contacts with y <dig> , y <dig> , c <dig> , i <dig> , v <dig>  and y165el <dig> in ffa <dig>  whereas 1-mcpc interacts with f <dig> , l <dig> , v <dig> , r <dig> , m <dig>  and f173el <dig> in ffa <dig>  the new structural models suggest a small binding cavity in ffa <dig> due to bulky aromatic residues and an intensive h-bonding network, structurally explaining a preference in binding of carboxylic acids with sp <dig> hybridized α-carbons to ffa <dig>  whereas a larger binding cavity in ffa <dig> with a lesser network of interactions could be a reason for a preference in binding of carboxylic acids with sp <dig> hybridized α-carbons to ffa <dig> as observed in pharmacological studies  <cit> . we predict that the residues that determine subtype selectivity between ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> are y <dig> , i <dig>  and e166el <dig> in ffa <dig> and the corresponded f <dig> , y <dig>  and l171el <dig> in ffa <dig> fig.  <dig> ligand binding in ffa <dig> and ffa <dig>  a: the binding mode of tiglic acid at ffa <dig>  b: the binding mode of 1-mcpc in ffa <dig>  c: the binding mode of  <dig> in ffa <dig>  ffa2- <dig> homology models are based on the ffa <dig> crystal structure. h-bonding and π- π interactions are shown in black and blue dotted lines, respectively



in addition, we have docked  <dig>  a highly potent synthetic agonist to the ffa1-based model of ffa <dig> to compare with the earlier ligand binding mode predicted from the β2-receptor-based homology model and mutagenesis  <cit> . both glide and inducedfit protocols dock  <dig> to the new ffa <dig> model in a similar fashion. in particular, the carboxyl group of the ligand contributes to a network of interactions through h-bonding involving y <dig> , y <dig> , r <dig> , y <dig> , h <dig>  and r <dig>  , similar to tak- <dig> binding in the crystal structure of ffa <dig> and different from earlier predictions, where tyrosines had hydrophobic interactions with  <dig>  the aromatic moiety of the agonist is pointed between helices  <dig> and  <dig> forming aromatic interactions with h <dig>  and hydrophobic contacts with v <dig>  and l <dig> . similar to ffa <dig>  histidine at position  <dig>  has some notable effect on the activity of fatty acids in ffa <dig> and ffa <dig>  <cit>  and greatly reduces the activity of  <dig>  a highly potent synthetic agonist in ffa <dig>  <cit> . this orientation is different from the position of the tak- <dig> hydrophobic tail but similar to predicted agonist binding mode  <dig> in ffa <dig>  the cyclopropyl group of  <dig> forms hydrophobic interactions with v <dig> , v <dig>  and r <dig> , and the cyclopentyl group makes contacts with c <dig> , v <dig> , i <dig>  and f168el <dig>  the importance of residues at positions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in binding of  <dig> is supported by mutagenesis  <cit> . the new model suggests the residues at positions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and f168el <dig> are now involved in direct interactions with  <dig> 

allosteric agonists, amg <dig>  <cit>  of ffa <dig> and  <dig> of ffa <dig>  <cit>   have been recently identified. alanine mutation of arginines at positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  does not affect the binding of these ligands in the corresponding receptors, indicating that a binding site of these ligands is distinct from free fatty acids  <cit> . several residues of the ffa <dig> receptor extracellular cavity predicted based on the β <dig> homology model have been mutated to identify the binding site of amg <dig> but none of the mutations substantially affected the potency of amg <dig>  <cit> . it has been only shown experimentally that the allosteric property of amg <dig> is prevented by the l173ael <dig> mutant or substitution of el <dig> with that of ffa <dig>  <cit> . in the new ffa <dig> model, l173el <dig> faces the binding cavity and links the el <dig> loop with helix  <dig>  potentially involved in the ligand binding process and subsequent conformational changes leading to activation. similar to ffa <dig> allosteric ligands, we hypothesize that the extracellular side involving helices  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with the positively charged residue at position  <dig>   could form the allosteric binding site in ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> .

in summary, the novel ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> models further delineate the orthosteric agonist binding site by interpreting the few available mutagenesis data. importantly, the novel models highlight non-conserved residues lining the orthosteric binding site at ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> that could be used for further mutagenesis studies. interestingly, unlike ffa <dig>  the ffa <dig> agonists cannot be easily docked to the interhelical space between helices  <dig> and  <dig>  however we cannot exclude this option. similar to ffa <dig>  mutagenesis of residues in helices  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and binding studies with different agonists would help in establishing ligand binding modes at ffa <dig>  the higher quality homology models could be now probed in in silico structure-based design, helping to discover the first ffa <dig> orthosteric ligands. finally, novel models suggest the location of the allosteric agonist binding site.

CONCLUSIONS
the free fatty acid receptors are recently discovered g protein-coupled receptors with potential impact to improve the life of patients suffering from diabetes, obesity and immune diseases. however, the absence of a large pool of various small molecule modulators with high potency and selectivity as well as acceptable pharmacokinetic properties create an obstacle to characterize ffa biology and physiology and subsequent validate these drug targets in the clinics. the published crystal structure of ffa <dig> in the complex with tak- <dig> in the last year  <cit>  represents the first direct structural knowledge of binding at the ffa <dig> receptor and facilitates the exploration of the binding sites at ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> 

our comparison of the previous models and the crystal structure of the ffa <dig> receptor shows that the homology models based on templates with 16–18 % sequence identity were useful in locating the binding site at ffas and identifying key residues for binding but not accurate in establishing the precise network of ligand-protein interactions and the ligand binding mode. furthermore, modelling of el <dig> is a challenging task to complete and this challenge still remains for ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> as there is low sequence similarity with ffa <dig>  our findings are in the line with conclusions made from community-based assessments of gpcr modelling on the example of the adenosine a2a, dopamine d <dig>  chemokine cxcr <dig>  serotonin 5ht1b and 5ht2b and smoothened receptors .

from modelling of the ffa <dig> receptor we posit that when the sequence identity is low  with respect to the receptors with available crystal structures, it is useful to explore several templates for homology modelling. thus, crystal structures of templates with differing positions of a ligand in the binding cavity can help to examine various ligand binding modes in docking studies. care should be taken with helices containing proline and glycine as these residues can remarkably change side chain packing and vary the position of the extracellular tips of the helices creating a distinct shape and size of the binding cavity, thus affecting docking conditions. furthermore, multiple templates could help in exploring various orientations of the side chain of lengthy residues within the binding site. thus, one of the challenge for ffa modelling was to predict a favourable position of the arginines for ligand docking. the importance of multiple templates for gpcr modelling has been discussed in literature using other receptors as a case study  <cit> .

docking to the ffa <dig> crystal structure predicts an alternative binding mode for agonists, in which the ligand hydrophobic tail is at the interhelical space between helices  <dig> and  <dig>  a similar mode of binding is predicted for ffa <dig> agonists. this binding mode can be linked with the available mutagenesis data. the ffa1-based models of ffa <dig> and ffa <dig> suggest hydrogen bonding of the agonist carboxyl group with two tyrosines at positions  <dig>  and  <dig> , in addition to two anchoring arginines. overall, the new structural models of ffas give more details on molecular reasons for the preference in binding of long or short chain fatty acids by highlighting the difference in the network of interactions between the receptors and identifying the position of non-conserved residues, which contribute to the shape and volume of the binding sites. in particular, we predict residues at positions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and two residues followed the disulfide bridged cysteine in the second extracellular loop play a central role in ffa subtype selectivity.

novel structural models of ffas suggest the location of an allosteric binding site. thus, the cavity between helices  <dig> and  <dig> and el <dig> with a putatively anchoring role of the residue at position  <dig>  is predicted. this residue has not been appreciated in earlier homology models as it was pointed outside of the helical bundle. to validate the importance of this residue in binding of allosteric modulators will require mutagenesis experiments. interestingly, this positively-charged residue in helix  <dig> makes the ffas binding cavity somewhat similar with the ffa <dig>  receptor – the receptor with a preference in binding of the long chain fatty acids, which has the positive-charged residue at position  <dig>  coordinating the carboxyl group of agonists  <cit> . despite binding the long chain fatty acids like ffa <dig>  this receptor has substantially low sequence identity with ffas .

ffa structural models provide more details on receptor-agonist interactions and suggest novel predictions for mutagenesis and medicinal chemistry. further insights in ligand binding modes at ffas will be fuelled by availability of receptor mutagenesis data for various ligands, including orthosteric and allosteric agonists and antagonists in the short term and validated by new crystal structures of ffas bound to different ligands in the long term.
