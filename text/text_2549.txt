BACKGROUND
the β-lactams are one of the most important classes of antibiotics. they are produced by different microorganisms, including filamentous fungi such as penicillium chrysogenum and aspergillus nidulans. these ascomycetes synthesize hydrophobic penicillins using three amino acids as precursors; l-α-aminoadipic acid, l-cysteine and l-valine to form the tripeptide δ -l-cysteinyl-d-valine  by the multienzyme acv synthetase , which is encoded by the pcbab gene. this tripeptide is converted into isopenicillin n , a reaction catalyzed by the ipn synthase  encoded by the pcbc gene  <cit> . in the last step of the penicillin pathway, the l-α-aminoadipyl side chain of ipn is substituted by aromatic acyl side chains to form hydrophobic penicillins. this reaction is catalysed by the isopenicillin n acyltransferase , encoded by the pende gene  <cit> . previous activation of the aromatic acid by a specific aryl-coa ligase is required  <cit> .

in p. chrysogenum, the pcbab, pcbc and pende genes are clustered with other orfs forming an amplifiable dna unit  <cit> . these other orfs play only a minor role in the penicillin biosynthesis, since complementation of the npe <dig> strain , which lacks the whole amplified region including the penicillin gene cluster  <cit> , with only the pcbab, pcbc and pende genes restored full β-lactam synthesis  <cit> .

the evolutionary origin of the penicillin gene cluster is intriguing  <cit> . the first two genes pcbab and pcbc do not contain introns despite the large size of pcbab ; they appear to have been transferred from β-lactam producing bacteria  <cit> , unlike the iat-encoding pende gene, which contains three introns and seems to have been recruited from the fungal genomes.

the last enzyme of the penicillin biosynthetic pathway  is synthesized as a 40-kda precursor , which undergoes an autocatalytic self-processing between residues gly102-cys <dig> in p. chrysogenum. the processed protein constitutes an active heterodimer with subunits α  and β   <cit> . the iat has up to five enzyme activities related to penicillin biosynthesis  <cit> . the substitution of the side chain either occurs directly through the ipn acyltransferase activity, or as a two-step process through the ipn amidohydrolase activity, thus forming 6-aminopenicillanic acid  as an intermediate  <cit> .

the p. chrysogenum iat belongs to the n-terminal nucleophile  family of proteins and it is capable of self-activation , as occurs with other ntn amidohydrolases  <cit> . this enzyme is located inside microbodies   <cit>  and its transport inside the peroxisomal matrix is not dependent on the processing state of the protein; the unprocessed proiat variant iatc103s is correctly targeted to peroxisomes, although it is not active  <cit> .

in silico analysis of the p. chrysogenum genome revealed the presence of a gene, pc13g <dig>  initially described as paralogue of the iat-encoding pende gene  <cit> . it was, therefore, of great interest to characterize the ial gene at the molecular level and its relationship with the pende gene regarding penicillin biosynthesis.

RESULTS
characterization of the ial gene in p. chrysogenum, which encodes a protein  with high similarity to iat
the genome of p. chrysogenum wis54- <dig> contains a gene  that was initially described as paralogue of the penicillin biosynthetic pende gene  <cit> . we have confirmed by sequence analysis that this gene is 100% identical to that in the wild-type strain nrrl  <dig>  indicating that further industrial strain improvement steps have not modified the sequence of this gene. we have termed this gene ial because it encodes a protein  that shares a 54% similarity  and a 52% similarity  with the iats of p. chrysogenum and a. nidulans, respectively. in addition, the ial showed 81% similarity with an unnamed protein product from a. oryzae , 80% similarity with a putative iat of a. clavatus , 79% similarity with the hypothetical protein an02g <dig> from a. niger , 78% similarity with a predicted protein from a. terreus , 76% similarity with a putative iat from neosartorya fischeri , 76% similarity with a putative iat from a. fumigatus  and 60% similarity with the hypothetical protein an <dig>  of a. nidulans , among others . the ial protein is present in several of the sequenced genomes of ascomycetes and deuteromycetes.

it is noteworthy that the p. chrysogenum ial shows some important amino acids and domains that are present in the wild-type iat, such as the  <dig> dgcts  <dig> motif  and the s <dig>  which is equivalent to the iat s <dig> residue required for iat cleavage and activity  <cit> . however, the peroxisomal targeting sequence  is absent from the c'-end of the p. chrysogenum ial and related proteins from other filamentous fungi, unlike what is observed in the p. chrysogenum and a. nidulas iats, which bear the pts <dig> arl and ani motifs, respectively .

penicillin biosynthesis is not affected in the ial null mutant
in order to test whether the ial protein participates in the biosynthesis of penicillin in p. chrysogenum, we studied the function of the gene in a penicillin high-producing strain, ds <dig>  <cit> . in order to generate null mutants in the ial gene without disturbing the genomic context, the amds marker was inserted between the ial promoter and its orf, in the opposite orientation . to increase the rate of homologous targeting, a derivative of p. chrysogenum ds <dig>  in which the non-homologous end-joining pathway is disturbed, was used as a host strain. as described for other fungi  <cit>  deletion of the p. chrysogenum ku <dig> homologue increases the frequency of homologous recombination significantly . acetamide-consuming transformants were obtained, purified on fresh media and verified for the correct insertion by pcr. shake flask experiments demonstrated that the ial null mutant had no effect on penicillin production in cp medium supplemented with either precursor, adipate or phenylactetate .

expression of the ial gene in p. chrysogenum and in vivo role of the ial in the benzylpenicillin biosynthetic pathway
to confirm these results, we carried out different experiments with the engineered strain p. chrysogenum npe10-ab·c. this strain is a transformed derivative of the npe <dig> pyrg- strain  that contains the pcbab and pcbc genes, but lacks the wild-type pende gene  <cit> . because of these features, this strain is optimal to assess the putative role of the ial protein in the benzylpenicillin biosynthetic pathway. the integrity of the ial gene in the npe10-ab·c strain was initially tested by pcr  and southern blotting . after digestion of the genomic dna with hindiii, one 11-kbp band was observed in the npe10-ab·c, size that is coincident with that provided by the wis54- <dig> strain digested with the same restriction enzymes . however, after sequencing the ial gene from the npe10-ab·c strain, we found a point mutation at nucleotide  <dig>  where c was changed into t . ipn production by the npe10-ab·c strain was confirmed by hplc . formation of benzylpenicillin  and 6-apa  that might be catalyzed by the ial, were assessed by growing the npe10-ab·c strain in cp medium. samples were taken at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, but neither 6-apa  nor benzylpenicillin  were detected by hplc. this indicates that the npe10-ab·c strain, which contains the ial gene, does not produce these compounds formed in the last step of the penicillin biosynthetic pathway. to test whether the lack of activity is due to a low or null expression rate of the ial gene, northern blot experiments were done with samples taken from the npe10-ab·c and the wis54- <dig> strains grown in cp medium. as shown in fig. 3e no transcript bands were detected at  <dig> or  <dig> h, indicating that this gene is very low or not expressed in p. chrysogenum, in agreement with the absence of detectable ial mrna in p. chrysogenum nrrl  <dig>  npe <dig>  wisconsin54- <dig> and ds <dig> strains .

overexpression of the ial gene in the p. chrysogenum npe10-ab·c strain
to assure high levels of the ial gene transcript, this gene  was amplified from p. chrysogenum wis54- <dig> and overexpressed using the strong gdh gene promoter. with this purpose, plasmid p43gdh-ial was co-transformed with plasmid pjl43b-ttrp into the p. chrysogenum npe10-ab·c strain. transformants were selected with phleomycin. five randomly selected transformants were analyzed by pcr  to confirm the presence of additional copies of the ial gene in the p. chrysogenum npe10-ab·c genome. integration of the pgdh-ial-tcyc <dig> cassette into the transformants of the npe10-ab·c strain was confirmed by southern blotting  using the complete ial gene as probe . transformants t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> showed the band with the internal wild-type ial gene  plus a  <dig> -kb band, which corresponds to the whole pgdh-ial-tcyc <dig> cassette. densitometric analysis of the southern blotting revealed that  <dig> copy of the full cassette was integrated in transformant t <dig>  and 3– <dig> copies in transformants t <dig> and t <dig>  additional bands, which are a result of the integration of incomplete fragments of this cassette, were also visible in these transformants. transformant t <dig> was randomly selected and expression of the ial gene was confirmed by northern blotting using samples obtained from mycelia grown in cp medium . this transformant was named p. chrysogenum npe10-ab·c·ial.

ipn amidohydrolase  and ipn acyltransferase  activities were tested in this strain under the same conditions used for the northern blot analysis. the npe10-ab·c·de strain is a derivative of p. chrysogenum npe10-ab·c that expresses the pende gene and has iat activity  <cit>  and it was used as positive control. neither 6-apa  nor benzylpenicillin  were detected in samples taken at  <dig> h and  <dig> h from cultures of the transformant t <dig> grown in cp medium with or without phenylacetic acid, whereas high penicillin production was observed in the control npe10-ab·c·de strain. this indicates that the ial protein is not involved in the biosynthesis of penicillin or 6-apa.

overexpression of the ialarl gene containing a modified peroxisomal targeting sequence in the p. chrysogenum npe10-ab·c strain
one important question is whether the absence of the canonical pts <dig> sequence  at the c-terminal end of the ial protein and the subsequent mislocalization outside the peroxisomal matrix, is responsible for the lack of activity. hence, site-directed mutagenesis of the ial gene was performed  in order to replace the three last amino acids of the ial protein with the motif arl. the new construct, p43gdh-ialarl was co-transformed together with plasmid pjl43b-ttrp into the p. chrysogenum npe10-ab·c strain and transformants were selected with phleomycin. five randomly selected transformants were analyzed by pcr to confirm the presence of additional copies of the ialarl gene in the p. chrysogenum npe10-ab·c genome . integration of the pgdh-ialarl-tcyc <dig> cassette into the npe10-ab·c strain was confirmed in these transformants by southern blotting , using the complete ial gene as probe. transformants t <dig> and t <dig> showed the band with the internal wild-type ial gene  plus a  <dig>  kb band, which corresponds to the whole pgdh-ialarl-tcyc <dig> cassette. additional bands, which are a result of the incomplete integration of this cassette, were also visible in transformant t <dig>  densitometric analysis of the southern blotting revealed that 1– <dig> copies of the full cassette had integrated in transformant t <dig>  and 2– <dig> copies in transformants t <dig>  transformant t <dig> was selected  and expression of the ialarl gene was confirmed by northern blotting using samples obtained from mycelia grown in cp medium . ipn amidohydrolase and ipn acyltransferase activities were tested under the same conditions used for the northern blot analysis . neither 6-apa  nor benzylpenicillin  were detected at any time, indicating that the ialarl protein is not able to convert ipn into 6-apa or benzylpenicillin even when the pts <dig> targeting signal is present.

overexpression of the cdna of the ial gene in e. coli. the ial is self-processed, but lacks in vitro phenylacetyl-coa: 6-apa acyltransferase activity
in order to analyse the ial processing and in vitro activity, the cdna of the ial gene obtained by rt-pcr as indicated in methods was overexpressed in e. coli jm <dig> . one 1089-bp band was amplified  and sequenced. two introns were identified within this gene by comparison of this sequence with the gdna of the ial gene. intron  <dig>  spanned nucleotides at positions 52– <dig> of the gdna, whereas intron  <dig>  spanned positions 518– <dig> of the gdna. the cdna of the ial gene was overexpressed using plasmid pulct-ial . as shown in fig. 6c, one 40-kda protein, coincident with the size estimated for the unprocessed ial protein, was obtained at 37°c. this protein was present in insoluble aggregates forming inclusion bodies. the authenticity of this protein was confirmed by maldi-tof peptide mass spectrometry. to test the processing of this protein, the ial gene was overexpressed at 26°c, a temperature that is optimal for iat folding and processing in e. coli  <cit> . at this temperature self-processing occurred; no traces of the ~40-da band were visible and the ~28-kda and ~ <dig> kda subunits were obtained in the soluble extracts of e. coli . we confirmed the processing through the analysis of the ~28-kda subunit by peptide mass fingerprinting. this peptide was identified as the c-terminal part of the ial, evidencing that the ial protein, like the iat, also undergoes a phenomenon of self-processing.

once processing was confirmed, in vitro activity of the processed ial protein was assessed  using the soluble extracts of e. coli obtained after the overexpression of the ial gene at 26°c. as positive control, soluble extracts containing the functional processed iat, obtained from e. coli after overepression of the cdna of the wild-type pende gene at 26°c , were used. benzylpenicillin formation was tested by bioassay as indicated in methods. as shown in fig. 6e, benzylpenicillin was only synthesized in the protein extracts containing the processed wild-type iat, but not in extract of the processed ial. this confirms that under in vitro conditions, the ial protein also lacks enzymatic activities related to the biosynthesis of benzylpenicillin, despite the correct self-processing.

discussion
the penicillin biosynthetic pathway has been largely elucidated  <cit> . in addition to the three main enzymes involved in this process , other ancillary proteins are also required, such as a phenylacetyl-coa ligases, which primes  the aromatic side chain  <cit>  and the phosphopantetheinyl transferase , which activates the acvs and is essential for penicillin biosyntheis in p. chrysogenum  <cit> . the origin of the pen gene cluster is intriguing, as occurs with the clusters of other fungal secondary metabolites  <cit> . the first two genes  of the penicillin pathway seem to originate from β-lactam producing bacteria  <cit> , whereas the third gene  encoding the iat that contains three introns, has been recruited from an ancestral fungal gene  <cit> . as reported here, in silico analysis of the p. chrysogenum genome identified a gene  paralogue of the pende gene  <cit>  that encodes a protein with high similarity to iat and is present in most of the genomes of ascomycetes.

we have shown in this work that the ial gene is expressed very poorly or not expressed at all in several p. chrysogenum strains and that generation of ial null mutants does not affect penicillin production. in addition, the ial gene in the npe10-ab·c strain has undergone a point mutation at nucleotide  <dig> . after cdna sequence analysis, this point mutation introduces a stop codon after residue  <dig>  which gives rise to a shorter protein  in the npe10-ab·c strain. the lack of activity of the ial present in this strain might be a consequence of the formation of a truncated version derived from the point mutation, but the fact that after overexpression of the ial gene , the ial protein still lacks both the ipn amidohydrolase and ipn acyltransferase activities in vivo, excludes this possibility.

due to the high homology existing between the iat and ial proteins we wondered about the reason for the lack of activity in the ial. the first possible cause was the absence of the pts <dig> peroxisomal targeting motif and the consequent putative mislocalization of the ial. however, when the pts <dig> was added to the c' end of the ial, this protein was unable to produce 6-apa or benzylpenicillin in vivo. strikingly, it has been recently reported that expression of the ial gene homologue in a. nidulans  is easily detected and the protein encoded by this gene contributes to penicillin biosynthesis  <cit> . the a. nidulans aatb-encoded ial homologue also lacks the canonical pts <dig> signal at the c' end, although it is active, indicating that either there might be cryptic pts <dig> sequences within this protein as it has been reported in literature  <cit> , or the enzyme is active in the cytosol. the latter possibility is more likely, since addition of the pts <dig> signal to the aatb-encoded ial homologue led to an increase in the penicillin titres  <cit> .

the wild-type iat is only active when it is self-processed into the α  and β  subunits  <cit> . it is well known that the p. chrysogenum and a. nidulans iats differ in their ability to maintain the 40-kda α-β heterodimer in an undissociated form  <cit> . whereas the p. chrysogenum proiat undergoes a quick and efficient self-processing, the a. nidulans proiat remains partially undissociated. this difference in the processing rate of proiat is responsible, among other reasons, for the low levels of benzylpenicillin production in a. nidulans . we have reported in a previous work that unprocessed proiat molecules exert a regulatory role generating slow-processing molecules of iat, thus decreasing the amount of the active form and the penicillin biosynthetic activity  <cit> . therefore, the lack of ial processing might be another explanation for its lack of activity in p. chrysogenum. however, when we analysed the sequence of this protein, we found that the g102-c <dig> processing site of iat is conserved in the ial . self-processing of the ial was confirmed by maldi-tof peptide mass spectrometry after sds-page analysis of the ial synthesized in e. coli at 26°c. this indicates that the ial, like the iat, belongs to the ntn family of proteins, which are capable of self-activation, as it occurs with other ntn amidohydrolases  <cit> . despite the proper processing, in vitro phenylacetyl-coa: 6-apa acyltransferase activity was not detected, proving that misprocessing is not responsible for the lack of activity.

a detailed analysis of the ial sequence showed that the amino acid equivalent to the s <dig> in the iat, which has been reported to be required for enzyme activity  <cit> , is not conserved in the ial of p. chrysogenum . however, in the ial homologue of a. nidulans the amino acid equivalent to the s <dig> is conserved, indicating that this might be the main reason for the disparity in enzyme activity between the ials of these two fungi. the s <dig> is part of the gxs309xg motif present in the p. chrysogenum and a. nidulans iats and has been previously proposed to be involved in cleavage of phenylacetyl-coa and binding of the phenylacetyl moiety to form acyl-enzyme molecules  <cit> . the formation of phenylacetyl-enzyme and other acyl-enzyme molecules has been confirmed in the iat by mass spectrometry  <cit> . although the a. nidulans ial does not exactly contain the gxsxg motif, the presence of the ser <dig>  equivalent to the ser <dig>  may be sufficient for the activity of this enzyme.

the availability of the genome of several ascomycetes has revealed the presence of ial gene homologues in penicillin and non-penicillin producing fungi, whereas the pende gene homologues are only found in penicillin-producing fungi, such as a. nidulans and a. oryzae. this might indicate that during evolution, a single ancestral gene was duplicated, giving rise to the pende  gene and its paralogue, the ial gene . the p. chrysogenum ial and related proteins in other fungi form a separate evolutive clade from iats , indicating that they evolved separately. this hypothesis is supported by the presence of duplicated genes encoding putatives iat and ial homologues in a. oryzae, which also contains the penicillin gene cluster. from those ascomycetes containing this cluster, only a. nidulans has an ial homologue  more closely related to iats, a fact that may explain the presence of penicillin biosynthetic activity in this protein.

genes encoding iats in p. chrysogenum, a. nidulans and a. oryzae contain three introns, thus differing from those genes encoding ial and ial-homologues . only the aatb gene encoding the a. nidulans ial homologue and one of the a. terreus ial gene homologue , contain three introns. this suggests that alternatively, ial and ial gene homologues might have had a different origin from the iat-encoding genes , thus encoding proteins with a different function as it was confirmed by the lack of penicillin biosynthetic activity of the p. chrysogenum ial. with this hypothesis, only the aatb gene from a. nidulans would be a real paralogue of the iat-encoding gene  formed by gene duplication from a common ancestor. this is supported by the presence of penicillin forming activity of the aatb-encoded ial homologue and by the presence of the same transcription factors binding to the promoter regions of these two genes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
if there was a common ancestor for the ial and pende genes, most of the ascomycota fungi initially had the potential capacity to perform the acyltransferase reaction. however, only a few of them, like a. nidulans and p. chrysogenum, were able to develop during evolution, the pende encoding the highly functional iat enzyme. the pende gene was linked to the first two genes  of the penicillin pathway, which endowed these microorganisms with an important ecological advantage because of the ability to generate aromatic penicillins. it is likely that the de novo formation of this cluster occurred in a common ancestor of the genera penicillium and aspergillus, since the pen cluster is present in several species of those genera  <cit> . however, not all genomes of the aspergilli contain the pen cluster; e.g., a. fumigatus lacks it, although it contains the ial gene. this indicates that the pen cluster might have been horizontally transferred only to some species of the genus, or alternatively, the primitive pen cluster might have been lost during subsequent evolution.
