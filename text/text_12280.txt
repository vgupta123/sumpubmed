BACKGROUND
alternative splicing of precursor messenger rna  is an important post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism that enhances the transcriptome plasticity and proteome diversity. alternative splicing produces multiple transcripts from a single gene by varying the selection of the include/exclude regions. the different splicing products of a single gene produce different protein isoforms with different functions and effects . alternative splicing can also introduce premature stop codons, which cause down-regulation of expression of the corresponding gene by nonsense-mediated decay  of mrna  <cit> .

the five basic types of alternative splicing are as follows: 1) exon skipping, if an exon is either included in or excluded from the pre-mrna; 2) intron retention, when an intron is either retained or excised from the pre-mrna; 3) alternative 5′ splice sites and 4) alternative 3′ splices site allow the extension or shortening of a particular exon, depending on the use of a proximal or distal 5′ and 3′ splice site, respectively; 5) mutually exclusive exons occur when two or more adjacent cassette exons are spliced such that only one of them is included at a time in the mrna  <cit> .

alternative splicing events are not rare, but quite common in eukaryotes. in human, ~95% of all intron-containing genes are alternatively spliced, ~60% in drosophila melanogaster, ~25% in caenorhabditis elegans and ~61% in arabidopsis thaliana  . the real percentages might even be higher than reported, because they correlate with the number of sequenced ests. an increased number of sequenced ests frequently reveal additional alternative splicing events because more and more rare splicing variants from genes with low expression become sequenced. for arabidopsis the reported percentage of alternatively spliced genes increased dramatically within a decade: it was  <dig> % in  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> % in  <dig>  <cit> , more than 30% in  <dig>  <cit> , 42% in  <dig>  <cit>  and 61% in  <dig>  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, the most frequent alternative splicing variant is intron retention   <cit> . most alternative splicing events in arabidopsis, i.e.  <dig> %, occur in the coding region and about 50% of which produce a premature termination codon that is a potential target for nmd  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> % of all alternative splicing events occur in the 5′-untranslated region  and  <dig> % in the 3′ utr  <cit> . in humans, the allocation is quite different from arabidopsis: the most common alternative splicing variant is exon skipping , whereas intron retention forms only a small fraction  of all alternative splicing events  <cit> .

two main factors that affect the occurrence of alternative splicing are intron lengths and the nucleotide composition of the introns  <cit> . intronic nucleotide composition has been shown to affect splicing efficiency of intron retention . compared to the average length of human introns, which is 3365 bp, arabidopsis introns are much shorter and show an average length of only 170 bp  <cit> . in human introns the at content is only  <dig> %  <cit> , while plant introns show a high at content: in arabidopsis it is 67% and in rice it is 73%  <cit> . moreover, the nucleotide composition of plant introns is also different between dicots and monocots. in rice, for example, the introns are longer and have a higher gc content than in arabidopsis, which might be an indication for a different impact of alternative splicing in these organisms .

alternative splicing produces protein isoforms that differ from each other with regard to localization, enzymatic activity, signaling effects and protein stability . in plants, alternative splicing was shown to be involved in signal transduction and timing of flowering  <cit> . alternative splicing can also act as a gene regulatory mechanism during developmental processes or in response to environmental conditions . various biotic and abiotic stress factors are known to influence alternative splicing . relevant abiotic stress factors are heavy metals, cold and heat. for example, the splicing of polyubiquitin and hsp <dig> mrnas in maize is affected by a heat shock  <cit> . biotic stress factors that influence alternative splicing are viral and bacterial pathogens  <cit> . plants even seem to regulate their transcriptome post-transcriptionally in response to quickly changing environmental conditions and pathogen attacks by using alternative splicing mechanisms  <cit> .

like in higher plants and animals, alternative splicing also is a common mechanism for increasing transcriptome diversity in much simpler organisms like algae. previous studies in volvocine green algae, which include unicellular forms like chlamydomonas reinhardtii  to colonial and multicellular forms with increasing complexity like volvox carteri , revealed a number of genes that undergo alternative splicing. examples include algal-cam
 <cit>  and rbr1/mat3
 <cit>  in volvox and cop1
 <cit>  and cge1
 <cit>  in chlamydomonas. a recent study about alternative splicing in chlamydomonas indicates that about 3% of all genes in chlamydomonas undergo alternative splicing  <cit> , which is much lower than recent reports from higher plants   <cit> . the analysis of a large est dataset of chlamydomonas resulted in  <dig> est clusters that show  <dig> alternative splicing events  <cit> . the results indicated that  <dig> % of the alternative splicing events in chlamydomonas  are alternative 5′ splice sites,  <dig> % are alternative 3′ splice sites,  <dig> % show both alternative 5′ and 3′ splice sites and  <dig> % show exon skipping. like in arabidopsis, the most frequent alternative splicing event in chlamydomonas is intron retention, which accounts for 50% of all events  <cit> .

based on molecular-phylogenetic studies, volvox and chlamydomonas probably diverged ~  <dig> million years ago from a common unicellular ancestor  <cit> . on the time-scales of evolution, the transition from unicellular to multicellular life in volvox is thus a quite recent occurrence when compared to other shifts to multicellularity. other transitions to multicellularity, such as the ones that gave rise to plants and animals, occurred deep in the past, approaching a billion years ago  <cit> . the evolution of multicellular live in volvocine algae required several developmental traits including asymmetric cell division and embryonic morphogenesis. most probably, the first multicellular volvocine algae were just small colonial organisms  without differentiated cells. later size, cell number and overall complexity increased and a tendency to cell differentiation evolved . finally, even a complete division of labor between somatic cells and germ cells developed   <cit> . comparative analyses of the volvox and chlamydomonas genomes revealed that the overall sequence divergence between these organisms is comparable to that between human and chicken  and arabidopsis and poplar . moreover, despite conserved synteny between the genomes, volvox and chlamyomdonas show higher rates of genomic rearrangement than vertebrates and eudicots do  <cit> . the nuclear genome of chlamydomonas is  <dig> mbp in size and that of its multicellular relative volvox is composed of  <dig> mbp. the larger genome of volvox  is attributed to its higher content of transposons and repetitive dna  <cit>  because both species have almost identical protein-coding potentials, i.e.,  <dig>  and  <dig>  protein-coding genes in chlamydomonas and volvox, respectively. only a few gene families, i.e., the pherophorin genes, the vmp genes  and the cyclin-d related genes have more members in volvox than in chlamydomonas
 <cit> . this suggests that the transition from a unicellular, chlamydomonas-like ancestor to multicellular volvox did not take major changes in gene content  <cit>  but mainly alterations in the mechanisms of genetic regulation. thus, development of organismal complexity might be mainly caused by evolutionary innovations of pre-existing proteins  and their binding sites, inventions of noncoding rnas, innovations in the mechanism of alternative splicing and increase of alternative splicing events . alternative splicing can produce different protein isoforms from a single gene, which has produced only a single protein in an ancestor; in this way, diversity increases. together with differences in selection pressures within a population, appearance or changes in alternative splicing can lead to speciation.

interestingly, two key factors that affect the splicing mechanism are different between the genomes of chlamydomonas and volvox: the intron length and the nucleotide composition. with an average length of 491 bp, the introns of volvox are clearly larger than chlamydomonas introns, which span only 371 bp on average  <cit>  . bioinformatic analyses showed that exons flanked by longer introns are more frequently subject to alternative splicing events than exons flanked by short introns  <cit> . furthermore, the genome of volvox shows a lower gc content  than the genome of chlamydomonas   <cit> , which might cause differences between the two species in alternative splicing  <cit> . based on these two key differences between both genomes, a detailed investigation of alternative splicing may reveal new insights into the gene regulation mechanisms that have been required for the evolutionary transition from unicellular chlamydomonas to multicellular volvox, while the number of genes remained about the same during this transition.

here we report the analysis of alternative splicing in the multicellular green alga volvox. after bioinformatic analysis of  <dig>  ests, we identified  <dig> alternative splicing events corresponding to  <dig> genes. we show the distribution of the different types of alternative splicing events in volvox and compare it with other species. to confirm our bioinformatic results, several alternatively spliced genes have been selected as representatives for experimental verification. after confirmation of alternative splicing variants by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction , the relative expression level of each splice variant was determined using quantitative real-time rt-pcr.

our results indicate that alternative splicing is a widespread process for generating protein isoform diversity in volvox, which suggests an important role of alternative splicing for expansion of organismal complexity during evolution of multicellularity and cell differentiation in volvocine algae.

RESULTS
genomic mapping of ests
the genome-wide analysis of alternative splicing in volvox and its comparison with both a closely related unicellular alga  and a more distantly related higher plant  required both extensive genomic and est sequence data. these data were obtained from the corresponding databases of volvox
 <cit> , chlamydomonas
 <cit>  and arabidopsis
 <cit>  . the data sets of the three species were treated in the same way to provide the necessary comparability.

all available ests of the three species were aligned to the corresponding genomic contigs and genome sequences using blat, a blast-like alignment tool  <cit> . only the best alignment was used to avoid double counting of paralogs. est sequences with less than 95% identity to any sequence in the corresponding genome were removed from further analysis. the resulting alignments were then clustered by their genomic location. in this process a cluster arises from the set of all ests, which overlap at a given genomic location.

subsequently, the splice site consensus sequences were identified for all splicing events. the vast majority of introns in protein-coding genes of volvox and of any other previously investigated eukaryote are canonical, which means that they have a gt dinucleotide at their 5′ end and an ag dinucleotide their 3′ end  <cit> . only about 1-2% of the introns are non-canonical. to compensate for artefacts that may occur in further analysis, we omitted alternative splicing events that involved introns with non-canonical splice site dinucleotides .

then, alternative splicing graphs of potential splice variants were constructed for each cluster in the three genomes. an intron was constructed in a given splice graph when there was est evidence of a transcript with canonical splice sites.

a representative sample of one alternative splicing locus out of  <dig>  loci in volvox is shown in figure  <dig>  at the  <dig>  loci we identified  <dig>  exons. this gives an average of  <dig>  exons per locus.figure  <dig>

alternative splicing analysis and abundance of splicing events
after genomic mapping of all available ests, we identified the alternatively spliced isoforms for each locus in volvox, chlamydomonas and arabidopsis. isoforms with alternative transcription starts or ends were not considered further in this paper, because we focus here on alternative splicing events. the alternatively spliced isoforms were divided into four major groups of events: exon skipping, intron retention, alternative 5′ and alternative 3′ splicing. in addition, there were instances of more complex splice forms, which were not covered by the above four simple alternative splicing events. to obtain splicing events with a high quality, we complement our predictions by a quality value to penalize the spurious events with poor est support.

the bioinformatic analysis identified  <dig> alternative splicing events in volvox in a total of  <dig> genes. thus, about  <dig> % of all ~ <dig>  protein-coding volvox genes are subject to alternative splicing. this percentage is more similar to the one observed in higher plants than to that in the closely related unicellular relative chlamydomonas; considering the number of analyzed ests.

the analysis of the different types of alternative splicing revealed that  <dig> % of all alternative splicing events show exon skipping in volvox,  <dig> % show intron retention,  <dig> % alternative 5′ splice sites and  <dig> % alternative 3′ splice sites . thus, the predominant type of alternative splicing in volvox is intron retention followed by alternative 3′ splice sites, alternative 5′ splice sites and exon skipping.figure  <dig> 
distribution of the different types of alternative splicing events. the percentage and total number  of splicing events is shown for each type of alternative splicing, i.e., intron retention , exon skipping , alternative 5′ splice site  and alternative 3′ splice site . asterisks  indicate the percentage of other, more complex alternative splicing types. the distribution is given for the species volvox
, chlamydomonas
, arabidopsis
 and human . the total number of alternative splicing events is  <dig> in volvox,  <dig> in chlamydomonas and  <dig>  in arabidopsis.



in the closely related alga chlamydomonas, the intron retention also is the most common type of alternative splicing , followed by alternative 3′ splice sites , alternative 5′ splice sites  and exon skipping  . in arabidopsis, the prevalence of different alternative splicing types shows the same distribution as in volvox and chlamydomonas, i.e. the percentage decreases in the following order: intron retention > alternative 3′ splice sites > alternative 5′ splice sites > exon skipping . in contrast to non-plant model organisms like human , exon skipping is the rarest simple form of alternative splicing in all of the three investigated species .

localization of alternative splicing events
in volvox, the majority of all alternative splicing events  affect the coding regions. another  <dig> % occur within non-coding regions  . the results from volvox were again compared with the genome and est data of chlamydomonas and arabidopsis
 <cit> , which were treated in the same way as the data from volvox . in chlamydomonas,  <dig> % of the alternative splicing events were detected in 5′ utrs and  <dig> % in 3′ utrs . in arabidopsis,  <dig> % of the alternative splicing events were localized in 5′ utrs and  <dig> % in 3′ utrs . in both organisms, the majority of alternative splicing events occur within the coding region, just as observed in volvox. more precisely, it was  <dig> % in chlamydomonas and  <dig> % in arabidopsis .figure  <dig>

experimental verification of alternative splicing events
to validate the quality of both the used ests and our bioinformatic analysis, ten sample genes with identified alternative splicing events were selected for experimental verification by rt-pcr and quantitative real time rt-pcr . the decisive factor in the choice of a sample gene to be tested was the potential modification of protein domains or protein sequence motifs by alternative splicing. strong est support, however, was not relevant for our selection. as a consequence of this approach, for some of the selected sample genes, like the genes for the mitochondrial translation elongation factor tu  and the selenocysteine-specific elongation factor   <cit> , only one supporting est for a given alternative splicing variant was available. by contrast, for other genes, like the gene for the oxygen evolving enhancer protein  <dig> , more than one hundred ests existed .

the statistical evaluation of the data obtained from our bioinformatic analysis of alternative splicing indicates that splice variants of genes that show exon skipping lead more frequently to changes in protein properties  than genes showing any other type of alternative splicing . for that reason, the following seven sample genes with exon skipping and  differences in the properties of the protein variants were selected: clpr <dig> , efg <dig> , hyd <dig> , lsg <dig> , mgmt , nrnp <dig>  and seleff  . of particular interest was the experimental verification of the splicing products of efg <dig> and seleff because of their uncommon gene structures with extremely long introns, which were 10772 bp  and 16365 bp  in length .figure  <dig>

. cyn23
 has mutually exclusive exons, oee1
 shows intron retention and ppi1
 uses alternative 5′ splice sites. in the second splice variant  of ppi <dig>  21 bp at the 5′ side of the intron are retained .



in addition to exon skipping, we chose three further sample genes with other types of alternative splicing, which also lead to changes in protein properties. the selected genes were cyn <dig> , which shows alternative splicing via mutually exclusive exons, oee <dig> , which is an example for intron retention, and ppi <dig> , which produces protein isoforms through alternative 5′ splice sites .

to allow for a distinction of the different splice variants of a given gene, we named the variants “first” and “second” splice variant. more precisely, the variant that shows an exon-intron structure identical or similar to a gene structure predicted as part of the volvox genome project  <cit>  or in a database entry  was called “first splice variant” and another splice variant was called “second splice variant”.

verification of exon skipping
the first of the seven sample genes with exon skipping was clpr <dig>  this gene codes for a highly conserved, atp-dependent serine protease  <cit> , which shows 86% identity to chlamydomonas clpr <dig> in an overlap of  <dig> amino acid residues  <cit> . clp proteases are involved in many cellular and extracellular processes such as degradation of misfolded proteins, cell signaling and removing of short-lived regulatory proteins  <cit> . the clpr <dig> gene of volvox is  <dig>  bp in length  and includes  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns . in the second splice variant of clpr <dig>  exon five that is 135 bp in length is excluded from the mrna by exon skipping . the first splice variant encodes a 284-residue polypeptide whereas the second splicing variant encodes a 239-residue polypeptide . the structure of the clpp protein isoform encoded by the second splice variant probably differs from the reported protein structure of clpp  <cit> , which is encoded by the first splice variant . the conserved amino acid residues f <dig>  n <dig>  y <dig> and l <dig>  which are involved in the α/β-type fold of the protein  <cit> , are lacking in the second protein variant of clpr <dig> . both splice variants of clpr <dig> have been amplified by rt-pcr to confirm the results of the bioinformatic analysis. for it, total rna was isolated from synchronously growing female volvox cultures at the stage of hatching. pairs of primers were established to amplify each splice variant separately. for amplification of the first splice variant of clpr <dig>  one primer, on <dig>  resides on exon  <dig>  which is lacking in the mrna of the second splice variant; the second primer is on <dig> on exon  <dig> . for verification of the second splice variant, one primer, on <dig>  only binds to the exon-exon junction of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which emerges only after removal of a 659 bp fragment between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> by splicing; the second primer was on <dig> on exon  <dig> . a 134-bp cdna fragment was predicted for variant  <dig> and a 117-bp fragment for variant 2; the rt-pcr yielded fragments of the expected sizes . it was also possible to amplify both variants in one and the same reaction using only a single pair of primers . fragments of 278 bp  and 143 bp  were expected and actually obtained in the rt-pcr ; it should be mentioned that in addition to the correct fragments, some non-specific side products were amplified . subsequently, the relative expression levels of both splice variants were measured by quantitative real-time rt-pcr, which is a sensitive method for analyzing relative expression levels of alternative splicing variants . as a reference gene for the quantitative real-time rt-pcrs the actin gene was used. the actin gene already has been used in previous studies as a reference in rt-pcr and quantitative real-time rt-pcr expression analyses . the primer pairs on15265/on <dig> and on15265/on <dig> were used to amplify the first and the second splice variant separately. both primer pairs did not produce any non-specific fragments during rt-pcr reactions and the fragment sizes were between  <dig> and 200 bp which is the optimal fragment size for quantitative real-time rt-pcr  <cit> . the expression levels were calculated using the ∆∆ct-method as described previously  <cit>  and the results are shown in figure 7a. the expression of the first splice variant of clpr <dig> is ~ <dig>  fold less than actin and ~ <dig>  fold higher than the expression of the second splice variant .figure  <dig>

the second exon skipping candidate was efg <dig> . this gene codes for the mitochondrial elongation factor ef-tu and it is localized at the mating type locus of volvox
 <cit> . ef-tu elongation factors belong to the large family of gtp-binding elongation factors  <cit> . the first splice variant of efg <dig> encodes a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acid residues, including three elongation factor domains, i.e. ef-tu, eftu-ii and eftu-iii . all three domains are essential for the elongation phase in protein synthesis  <cit> . the first domain, ef-tu, is the catalytic domain, which is responsible for the binding to the guanine nucleotide  <cit> . the non-catalytic domains ii and iii show a beta-barrel structure with six anti-parallel strands, which appear to be tightly associated to the catalytic domain  <cit> . interestingly, six exons are excluded in the second splice variant, which reduces the length of the mrna by  <dig> nucleotides and the encoded polypeptide chain by  <dig> amino acid residues . in the second variant,  <dig> amino acid residues of the catalytic ef-tu domain are lacking, which will in all likelihood affect the binding properties of the domain. moreover, gtp-binding proteins usually have two conserved sequences with the consensus sequences asn-lys-x-asp  and ser-ala-leu/lys , which are important for the binding to a guanine nucleotid  <cit> ; both motives are lacking in the second variant . the first part of the eftu-ii domain also is absent in the second variant, which should cause altered binding properties and, thus, affect its activity in rna translation  <cit> . for amplification of the first splice variant of efg <dig> by rt-pcr, the primer on <dig> resides on exon  <dig> and primer on <dig> is located on exon 6; both exons are lacking in the mrna of the second splice variant. for verification of the second splice variant, one primer, on <dig>  only binds to the exon-exon junction of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which emerges only after removal of a large fragment  between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> by splicing; the second primer was on <dig> on exon  <dig>  a 151-bp cdna fragment was predicted for variant  <dig> and a 176-bp fragment for variant 2; the rt-pcr yielded fragments of the expected sizes . it was also possible to amplify both variants in one and the same reaction using only a single pair of primers . fragments of 664 bp  and 154 bp  were expected and actually obtained in the rt-pcr . the relative expression levels of both splice variants of efg <dig> could not be determined by quantitative real-time rt-pcr because non-specific side products defeated the analysis repeatedly .

the third sample gene was hyd <dig>  this gene codes for an iron hydrogenase, which catalyzes the reversible conversion of molecular hydrogen to protons and electrons  <cit>  . the first splice variant of hyd <dig> encodes a polypeptide with a large fe-only hydrogenase domain, which is  <dig> amino acid residues long . in the second splice variant,  <dig> amino acid residues are lacking at the n-terminal end of the polypeptide , including  <dig> amino acid residues of the fe-only hydrogenase domain  <cit> . the x-ray crystal structure of the fe-only hydrogenase from clostridium pasteurianum could show that the amino acid residues  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> are essential to form β sheets around the active site  <cit>  . lack of this part in the second splice variant should change the protein structure and, as a consequence, the enzyme characteristics. in contrast, the actual active site is present in both variants of the fe-only hydrogenase  <cit>  . there are three conserved protein sequence motifs in the active site of variant  <dig>  motif  <dig> , motif  <dig>  and motif  <dig> , and variant  <dig> contains exactly the same motifs except for the very first amino acid residue of motif  <dig>  for amplification of the first splice variant of hyd <dig> by rt-pcr, one primer, on <dig>  resides on exon  <dig>  which is lacking in the mrna of the second splice variant; the second primer was on <dig> on exon  <dig> . for verification of the second splice variant, one primer, on <dig>  only binds to the exon-exon junction of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which emerges only after removal of a 818 bp fragment between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> by splicing; the second primer was on <dig> on exon  <dig> . a 128-bp cdna fragment was predicted for variant  <dig> and a 102-bp fragment for variant 2; the rt-pcr yielded fragments of the expected sizes ; the band of variant  <dig> showed a lower intensity than the band of variant  <dig>  it was not possible to amplify both variants of hyd <dig> in one and the same reaction, instead only one of both variants was amplified . however, the relative expression levels of both splice variants could be determined by quantitative real-time rt-pcr. the expression of the first splice variant of hyd <dig> is only ~ <dig>  fold higher than the expression of the second splice variant . compared to actin, both splice variants are expressed at a very low level, i.e. hyd <dig> variants  <dig> and  <dig> account for only  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, of the actin expression level .

the fourth exon skipping candidate was lsg <dig>  this volvox gene codes for a matrix metalloproteinase; lsg <dig> was shown to be expressed with an above-average rate during the late developmental stages in somatic cells  <cit>  . lsg <dig>  shows 31% identity to the gamete lytic enzyme  of chlamydomonas in an overlap of  <dig> amino acid residues. gle of chlamydomonas is a proteinase, which degrades cell walls of gametes during mating  <cit> . for enzymatic degradation, it contains a large peptidase m <dig> domain  the m <dig> domain is conserved among several metalloproteinases including vmps  <cit> . the typical hexxhxxgxxh motif, which contains four histidine residues for zinc binding in the active site of the enzyme  <cit>  can be found in variant  <dig> of lsg <dig> . another motif, which is believed to be responsible for the binding to calcium, is also conserved in variant  <dig> of lsg <dig> . in contrast,  <dig> amino acid residues of the peptidase m <dig> domain are lacking in the polypeptide encoded by the second splice variant, because exon nine  is excluded by exon skipping . for amplification of the first splice variant of lsg <dig> by rt-pcr, one primer, on <dig>  resides on exon  <dig>  which is lacking in the mrna of the second splice variant; the second primer was on <dig> on exon  <dig> . for verification of the second splice variant, one primer, on <dig>  only binds to the exon-exon junction of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which emerges only after removal of a 2285 bp fragment between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> by splicing; the second primer was on <dig> on exon  <dig> . a 137-bp cdna fragment was predicted for variant  <dig> and a 131-bp fragment for variant 2; the rt-pcr yielded fragments of the expected sizes . it was also possible to amplify both variants in one and the same reaction using only a single pair of primers . fragments of 482 bp  and 173 bp  were expected and actually obtained in the rt-pcr ; it should be mentioned that in addition to the correct fragments, some non-specific side products were amplified . quantitative real-time rt-pcr showed that both splice variants are expressed at a very low level in comparison to actin. however, the expression of the first splice variant of lsg <dig> is ~ <dig> fold higher than the expression of the second splice variant .

the fifth sample gene was mgmt. this gene codes for a putative 6-o-methylguanine dna methyltransferase . the o-6-methylguanine-dna methyltransferase is essential for viability because it reverses dna alkylation damage by removing the offending alkyl group . the first splice variant of mgmt encodes a polypeptide with  <dig> amino acid residues in length  and contains a dna binding domain, which is  <dig> amino acid residues long  <cit>  . as a result of the exon skipping event,  <dig> residues are lacking in the dna binding domain of the second variant . some of these  <dig> amino acid residues were previously shown to be involved in dna binding  <cit> . for example, the tyrosine residue at position  <dig> of variant  <dig>  has been shown to be a key residue involved in recognition of the o6-alkylguanine lesion through a hydrogen bond with the n <dig> atom of the modified base  <cit> . furthermore, the arginine residue at position  <dig> of variant  <dig>  is necessary for the repair of base damage in duplex dna  <cit> . the absence of these two amino acid residues most probably affects the binding characteristics of the second protein variant. for amplification of the first splice variant of mgmt by rt-pcr, one primer, on <dig>  resides on exon  <dig>  which is lacking in the mrna of the second splice variant; the second primer was on <dig> on exon  <dig> . for verification of the second splice variant, one primer, on <dig>  only binds to the exon-exon junction of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which emerges only after removal of a 276 bp fragment between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> by splicing; the second primer was on <dig> on exon  <dig> . a 173-bp cdna fragment was predicted for variant  <dig> and a 165-bp fragment for variant 2; the rt-pcr yielded fragments of the expected sizes ; in the pcr of variant  <dig> also two larger, non-specific side products were amplified, as verified by cloning and sequencing. it was also possible to amplify both variants in one and the same reaction using only a single pair of primers . fragments of 310 bp  and 223 bp  were expected and actually obtained in the rt-pcr ; it should be mentioned that in addition to the correct fragments, a larger, non-specific side product was amplified .

the sixth exon skipping candidate was nrnp <dig>  this volvox gene codes for a polypeptide with two rna recognition motif  domains, also known as rna binding domains . the rrm domain is by far the most abundant type of eukaryotic rna-binding motif. this domain is involved in different cellular processes like mrna and rrna processing, rna export and rna stability . the first splice variant of nrnp <dig> encodes a polypeptide with  <dig> amino acid residues; the rrms are localized at amino acid residues  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> . the protein product of the second splice variant is  <dig> amino acid residues shorter than the first variant . in the second variant, the first rrm domain is lacking and the second rrm domain is truncated, i.e.,  <dig> amino acid residues are lacking . the crystal structure analysis of the rrm domain previously showed that the first part of the domain is important for correct folding  <cit> . the complete elimination of the first rrm and the truncation of the second rrm domain most probably change the rna binding capacity significantly in the second variant. for amplification of the first splice variant of nrnp <dig> by rt-pcr, one primer, on <dig>  resides on exon  <dig>  which is lacking in the mrna of the second splice variant; the second primer was on <dig> on exon  <dig> . for verification of the second splice variant, one primer, on <dig>  only binds to the exon-exon junction of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which emerges only after removal of a 542 bp fragment between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> by splicing; the second primer was on <dig> on exon  <dig> . a 116-bp cdna fragment was predicted for variant  <dig> and a 107-bp fragment for variant 2; the rt-pcr yielded fragments of the expected sizes . it was also possible to amplify both variants in one and the same reaction using only a single pair of primers . fragments of 342 bp  and 152 bp  were expected and actually obtained in the rt-pcr ; it should be mentioned that in addition to the correct fragments, a larger, non-specific side product was amplified .

the seventh and last exon skipping candidate was seleff, which is localized at the mating type locus of volvox
 <cit>  . this gene codes for a putative selenocysteine-specific elongation factor . such translation factors are necessary for the incorporation of selenocysteine into proteins; seleffs probably replace ef-tu for the insertion of selenocysteine directed by the uga codon  <cit> . in the first splice variant of seleff, a very short exon  is flanked by two very large introns,  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp in length . this exon is excluded from the second splice variant by exon skipping and thus, an intron of  <dig>  bp is spliced out. this intron seems to be the largest intron reported so far in volvox. the alternative splicing event in the second variant also introduces a premature stop codon into the open reading frame . unfortunately, no information about the structure of seleff proteins is available, but the elimination of  <dig> amino acid residues in the second splice variant means that the length of the polypeptide is almost halved relative to the first variant and this significant cut-off probably affects the structure and characteristics of this translation factor. for amplification of the first splice variant of seleff by rt-pcr, one primer, on <dig>  resides on exon  <dig>  which is lacking in the mrna of the second splice variant; the second primer was on <dig> on exon  <dig> . for verification of the second splice variant, one primer, on <dig>  only binds to the exon-exon junction of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which emerges only after removal of a 16365 bp fragment between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> by splicing; the second primer was on <dig> on exon  <dig> . a 196-bp cdna fragment was predicted for variant  <dig> and a 166-bp fragment for variant 2; the rt-pcr yielded fragments of the expected sizes ; in addition to the correct fragments, a larger, non-specific side product was amplified in the rt-pcr for the second variant. it was also possible to amplify both variants in one and the same reaction using only a single pair of primers . fragments of 357 bp  and 301 bp  were expected and actually obtained in the rt-pcr ; in addition to the correct fragments, some non-specific side products were amplified .

verification of mutually exclusive exons
the sample gene for mutually exclusive exons was cyn <dig>  which encodes a cyclophilin-related protein . cyclophilins are ubiquitous proteins that belong to the family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases   <cit> , also known as immunophilins. these immunophilins are proposed to function in protein folding, protein degradation, stress response, signal transduction and pre-mrna splicing . the cyn <dig> gene contains two alternate mutually exclusive exons, exons  <dig> and  <dig>  because both exons are  <dig> nucleotides in length , the number of amino acid residues of the two protein isoforms is identical. however, the two isoforms differ from each other at  <dig> amino acid positions: a125g, g127y, g128d, n129d, k130p, g132s, a133g, r134a, v139i, e150q, a152t, i153a and g155a . some of these residues, like alanine at position  <dig>  have been reported to be part of the cyclosporin-binding site  <cit> . moreover, exchange of amino acids between positions  <dig> and  <dig> by site-directed mutagenesis was shown to affect the binding properties of cyclophilins  <cit> . therefore, the differences in amino acid sequence between the two isoforms might produce isoforms with different binding properties. for amplification of the first splice variant of cyn <dig> by rt-pcr, one primer, on <dig>  resides on exon  <dig> and the second primer is on <dig> on exon  <dig> . for verification of the second splice variant, one primer, on <dig>  resides on exon  <dig> and the second primer again was on <dig> on exon  <dig>  a 145-bp cdna fragment was predicted for variant  <dig> and a 146-bp fragment for variant 2; the rt-pcr yielded fragments of the expected sizes . due to the almost identical fragment sizes and the resulting identical migration distances in the gel, both variants were not amplified in one and the same reaction. quantitative real-time rt-pcr showed that both splice variants are expressed at a very low level in comparison to actin. however, the expression of the first splice variant of cyn <dig> is ~ <dig>  fold higher than the expression of the second splice variant .

verification of intron retention
the candidate gene for verification of intron retention was oee <dig>  which codes for a subunit of the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem ii . previously, it was demonstrated that oee <dig> is subject to germline-specific expression in volvox
 <cit> . the first splice variant of oee <dig> encodes a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acid residues , which shows 87% identity to oee <dig> of chlamydomonas in an overlap of  <dig> amino acid residues  <cit> . it includes a large manganese-stabilizing protein  domain , which is required for photosystem ii assembly, stability and photoautotrophy  <cit> . in the second splice variant of oee <dig>  the first intron  is retained by alternative intron retention , which potentially leads to an n-terminally truncated protein isoform with a shortened mps domain .

for verification of the first splice variant of oee <dig> by rt-pcr, one primer, on <dig>  only binds to the exon-exon junction of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which emerges only after removal of intron  <dig>  by splicing; the second primer was on <dig> on exon  <dig> . for amplification of the second splice variant, one primer, on <dig>  resides on the retained intron sequence , which therefore is lacking in the mrna of the first splice variant; the second primer was on <dig> on exon  <dig> . a 111-bp cdna fragment was predicted for variant  <dig> and a 158-bp fragment for variant 2; the rt-pcr yielded fragments of the expected sizes . quantitative real-time rt-pcr showed that the expression of the first splice variant of oee <dig> is ~ <dig> fold higher than actin; whereas the expression of the second variant is ~ <dig> fold less than actin .

the bioinformatic analysis of est sequences revealed a third splice variant of ooe <dig>  for verification of this variant by rt-pcr, one primer, on <dig>  only binds to the exon-exon junction of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which emerges only after removal of a 356 bp fragment between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> by splicing; the second primer was on <dig> on exon  <dig> . a 112-bp cdna fragment was predicted for variant  <dig>  however, we were not able to confirm this variant by rt-pcr .

verification of alternative 5′ splice sites
the sample gene for alternative 5′ splice sites was ppi <dig>  which codes for a protein with an ypi <dig> domain . the ypi <dig> domain is a saccharomyces cerevisiae type  <dig> protein phosphatase inhibitor  <cit> . the gene ppi <dig> of volvox is a quite small gene with a single intron, which is 100 bp in length. the first splice variant of ppi <dig> encodes a 100-amino-acid polypeptide, which shows 82% identity to the fap <dig> protein of chlamydomonas. fap <dig> is a flagellar associated protein found in the flagellar proteome  <cit>  . in the second splice variant, 21 bp at the 5′ side of the intron are retained and thereby a premature stop codon is introduced . as a consequence, a shortened protein isoform with a truncated ypi <dig> domain is produced .

for verification of the first splice variant of ppi <dig> by rt-pcr, one primer, on <dig>  only binds to the exon-exon junction of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which emerges only after complete removal of the 100 bp of intron  <dig> by splicing; the second primer is on <dig> on exon  <dig> . for amplification of the second splice variant, one primer, on <dig>  resides on the retained 21 bp of intron  <dig>  which therefore is lacking in the mrna of the first splice variant; the second primer was on <dig> on exon  <dig> . a 140-bp cdna fragment was predicted for variant  <dig> and a 141-bp fragment for variant 2; the rt-pcr yielded fragments of the expected sizes ; the band of variant  <dig> showed a lower intensity than the band of variant  <dig>  quantitative real-time rt-pcr showed that the expression of the first splice variant of ppi <dig> is ~70% higher than the expression of actin and even ~1000% higher than the expression of variant  <dig> 

discussion
a comparative view on alternative splicing in volvox
this work provides a bioinformatic analysis of  <dig>  ests in relation to alternative splicing events in the multicellular green alga volvox. the results show that  <dig> % of the alternative splice events are within the coding region  and thus have an effect on the protein sequence and, as a consequence, frequently also on protein structure and function. the remaining  <dig> % of all alternative splice events in volvox were within the 5′ and 3′ utrs , which is higher than reported data  from arabidopsis , mouse and human  and this study). thus, utrs in the alga volvox are more frequently target of alternative splicing than utrs in the land plant arabidopsis . alternative splicing of utrs can play a key role both in regulation and in the production of mrna diversity  <cit> . moreover, changes in mrna secondary structure can affect rna processing, mrna stability and translation of the messenger . in addition, it possibly creates phenotypic variability  <cit> . in multicellular organisms, regulation of mrna stability plays a crucial role in development, growth and differentiation  <cit> . that data indicate that there might be more variability and diversity through alternative splicing in volvox utrs than in arabidopsis utrs .table  <dig>

the distribution scheme of the different types of alternative splicing in volvox shows that intron retention is the predominant type, while exon skipping is only a smaller part . interestingly, the situation in human is just opposite to the situation in volvox: there are only 1% intron retention events and  <dig> % exon skipping events . these highly differing distributions could result from different genome features. for example, the introns in human are much longer than in volvox, or to be more exact, the median sizes of introns are  <dig>  bp versus 358 bp  <cit> . the size of introns is crucial factor in the mechanism of intron retention, i.e., short introns were shown to be much more frequently retained than longer introns . on the contrary, an increase in intron length correlates positively with promotion of the exon skipping mechanism  <cit> . therefore, intron length is the determining factor for the switch from the intron definition mechanism, in which the 5′ and 3′ splice sites are initially recognized and paired across the intron, to the exon definition mechanism, in which splice sites are paired first across the exons, with spliceosome assembly proceeding through subsequent pairing of exon units  <cit> . thus, a plethora of short introns is volvox is probably recognized and spliced out through the intron definition mechanism, while in human the exon definition mechanism is dominant because a vast number of exons is flanked by long introns  <cit> . it should be noted that the introns of chlamydomonas are even somewhat  shorter than those in volvox, i.e., the average lengths are 491 bp and 373 bp, respectively , but the calculated intron retention rate is about the same in both organisms . however, the intron lengths of both species can be considered as short and therefore the intron definition mechanism seems to apply for both species to the same extend.

our analysis of ests in volvox revealed that  <dig> % of all volvox genes undergo alternative splicing, which is similar to the reported 3% for chlamydomonas
 <cit> . the absolute numbers of alternative splicing events were  <dig> for volvox and  <dig> for chlamydomonas . however, it should be noted that the absolute numbers and percentages have been calculated based on different total est numbers, i.e., the number of analyzed ests in chlamydomonas  was almost twice that of volvox   even if the total number of protein-coding loci is about the same in volvox  and chlamydomonas   <cit> . because the total number of ests is a critical value for detection of alternative splicing events, probably more alternative splicing events remained undetected in volvox than in chlamydomonas. these results and considerations indicate that actually the rate of alternatively spliced genes is higher in volvox than in chlamydomonas and, thus, also the variability and diversity through alternative splicing appears to be higher in volvox. however, the data presented here are not corrected for the amount of transcript evidence available.

the number of ests analyzed in volvox  is similar to the number of ests analyzed in arabidopsis  in a study by zhu et al. in  <dig>  <cit> , which came to a value of  <dig> % alternatively spliced genes for arabidopsis . as mentioned above, nine years later, after sequencing countless more ests, the rate was calculated to be 61%  <cit> . therefore, in actual fact, alternative splicing in the alga volvox might be just as common as in higher eukaryotes like arabidopsis, drosophila or even human  <cit> 
.

some striking alternative splicing events in volvox
during our genome-wide analysis, we found some genes with remarkable alternative splicing variants regarding the size or number of excluded introns and exons.

one of these genes is efg <dig>  which is subject to exon skipping . the first splicing variant of efg <dig> contains  <dig> exons. in the second splicing variant even six consecutive exons  are skipped at once. these exons are quite short, i.e., between  <dig> and 121 bp in size, and also the sequences between the exons are short . however, two extremely long introns flank the skipped sequence: the introns  <dig>  and  <dig>  are  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp in length, respectively . thus, in the second splicing variant an intron of  <dig>  bp is spliced out, which contains exons 5- <dig> and introns 4- <dig>  this spliced fragment of the second variant is one of the longest introns identified in volvox so far . in arabidopsis and maize, the longest reported introns are about  <dig> and 7 kb in length, respectively . the longest introns among all plants have been identified in tobacco and rice, which are about  <dig> and 28 kb in length, respectively  <cit> . in general, especially long introns can contain regulatory elements to control gene expression under certain conditions   <cit> .

the seleff gene is also subject to exon skipping. the first splicing variant of seleff contains  <dig> exons. in the second splicing variant a single small exon , only 56 bp in length, is skipped. this exon is flanked by two extremely long introns, which are  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp in length, respectively . thus, in the second splicing variant an intron of  <dig>  bp is spliced out , which contains exon  <dig>  intron  <dig> and intron  <dig>  this spliced ~16 kb fragment of the second variant is one of the longest introns identified in the plant lineage so far; it is longer than any intron in arabidopsis or maize.

alternative splicing and organismal complexity
alternative splicing is a major mechanism for generating proteome diversity, which probably was co-opted in evolution of multicellular complexity  <cit> ; it plays a critical role in differentiation and development of multicellular eukaryotes  <cit> . because volvox only has about the same number of protein-coding genes compared to its unicellular relative chlamydomonas, alternative splicing could have contributed to an increase in proteome diversity when a unicellular chlamydomonas-like ancestor evolved to the multicellular volvox alga with its differentiated cells. in more concrete terms, the transition to multicellularity in volvocine algae required a proteome with an increased capacity to address new traits and tasks like multicellularity, cell differentiation, multicellular motility and phototaxis as well as egg and sperm formation. alternative splicing seems to be particularly important for the generation of new or modified regulatory proteins, which are indispensable in the evolution of multicellular complexity  <cit> . especially transcription factors and signal transducers that act as key regulators in complex, multicellular systems seem to be subject to extensive alternative splicing  <cit> .

in our analysis we found some evidence that alternative splicing actually affects key regulators. for example, the retinoblastoma gene rbr1/mat <dig>  which codes for a key cell cycle and cell size regulator  <cit> , is only subject to alternative splicing in the multicellular alga volvox; no such event has been reported its close unicellular relative chlamydomonas
 <cit> . this gene also shows gender-specific splicing in volvox and it is believed to be involved by the evolution of oogamy  <cit> . also worth mentioning is the general distribution of alternatively spliced genes in volvox in relation to its unicellular relative chlamydomonas. for it, we took one-hundred alternatively spliced genes from volvox and compared them with the corresponding orthologs in chlamydomonas. ten of these one-hundred genes were those that were selected for experimental verification and another ninety alternatively spliced genes were randomly selected. the results are shown in figure  <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig>  the comparison demonstrates that the largest fraction of alternatively spliced genes in volvox  does not exhibit alternative splicing in the unicellular alga chlamydomonas. the lack of alternative splicing events for those genes in chlamydomonas is not due to poor est support, because the total number of ests is lower for the volvox genes than for their orthologs in chlamydomonas . this observation supports the idea that alternative splicing events increased during evolution from the unicellular ancestor to the multicellular alga volvox in order to expand the transcript diversity and, as a consequence, the proteomic diversity. recently, the group of urrutia also demonstrated a strong association between alternative splicing and organism complexity  <cit> . in addition to alternative splicing, gene duplication followed by divergence also increases proteome diversity  <cit> . during evolution of multicellular volvocine algae, the number of members in several protein families increased significantly through gene duplication. the families with the most extensive expansions are the vmps, the pherophorins and the cyclin ds, which are involved in the  biosynthesis of the extracellular matrix and in the regulation of cell division program during development  <cit> .figure  <dig>

however, in contrast to the extent of gene duplications, which remains invariant after sequencing of the genome, it can be expected that the percentage of alternatively spliced genes will increase strongly in volvox when more and more est data and full-length cdna sequences become available, just as it happened earlier in arabidopsis
. in all probability, deep sequencing of the volvox transcriptome during asexual and sexual development, during embryonic cleavage divisions and cellular differentiation and under various environmental conditions  will yield numerous new splicing variants. thus, it is becoming increasingly clear that alternative splicing is not an exception, but relatively widespread in volvox and other eukaryotes. this degree raises quite difficult questions: do all splice isoforms have functional significance? how big is the noise in the splicing process? at which extent do truncated and misfolded proteins play a role in cellular regulation? which amount of inadvertently produced isoforms can be tolerated by a cell? however, frequently alternative splicing seems to be part of molecular mechanisms that allow  cells of an organism to decrease the concentration of certain  proteins without changing the transcription rate of the corresponding genes. instead, shortened or modified non-functional mrna variants are generated by alternative splicing. in this way, specific cellular and physiological processes can be attenuated, altered or even intensified at the post-transcriptional level.

in human, splicing error rates of  <dig> to  <dig> percent have been calculated  <cit> , but it remains difficult to distinguish between functional and non-functional isoforms because also truncated proteins might have a function. in several studies, criteria like abundance, conservation of splicing events across species, tissue specificity and developmental stage specificity have been used to assess functionality  <cit> . different models proceed on the assumption that the splicing machinery makes mistakes at a constant error rate, is dependent on the number of introns or is determined by the number of introns and transcript abundance  <cit> .

however, the noise in the splicing process should not be considered as a collateral damage of splicing. noise in splicing might have been an important factor in the evolution of multicellularity in volvocine algae because it creates a landscape of opportunities in which novel biological activity can be explored at very little cost  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the approach for prediction of alternative splicing events in volvox was accurate and reliable. moreover, quantitative real-time rt-pcr appears to be useful for analyses of relationships between the appearance of specific alternative splicing variants and different kinds of physiological, metabolic and developmental processes as well as responses to environmental changes.
