BACKGROUND
cellular function is accomplished by the accurate, regulated transcription of genes in the genome. the quantity of transcribed mrna of protein-coding genes varies, and the regulation of transcription is carried out by a wide variety of nuclear factors on the chromatin structure. one of the key regulatory mechanisms is the control of the activation of rna polymerase ii   <cit> .

rnapii transcribes all protein-coding genes and many non-coding genes, and the activity of rnapii correlates with the phosphorylation state of rpb <dig>  the large catalytic subunit of rnapii  <cit> . rpb <dig> has an unusual c-terminal domain  that consists of repeats of the heptapeptide consensus sequence n-tyr1-ser2-pro3-thr4-ser5-pro6-ser7-c, of which there are  <dig> copies in mammals  <cit> . the amino acids in these repeats are potential targets for modification, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation. during transcriptional regulation, free hypophosphorylated rnapii is recruited to gene promoters. rnapii's escape from the promoter requires tfiih, a general transcription factor that mediates phosphorylation of ctd ser <dig>  <cit> . after promoter escape, rnapii can move downstream of the transcription start site   <cit> ; however, pausing factors, such as nelf and dsif, prevent productive elongation of mrna  <cit> . this phenomenon is known as promoter proximal pausing  <cit> . productive elongation of mrna is coupled with phosphorylation of the ctd ser <dig> residue  <cit> . the influence of promoter proximal pausing of rnapii may contribute to the control of gene expression levels  <cit> . it is possible that full length mrna cannot be detected because of pausing, and that a wide variety of expression levels, including high expression, are regulated by pause site entry and escape of rnapii  <cit> . recent studies revealed that rnapii could bind to the promoter region of inactive genes in human fibroblasts  <cit> , as well as in es cells  <cit> . additionally, in mouse es cells, ser <dig> phosphorylated and ser <dig> unphosphorylated rnapii accumulates around the tsss in bivalent genes  <cit> . these genes, as differentiation markers, can be detected at low levels, despite their association with pluripotency  <cit> . high throughput sequencing technology and cdna analysis have emerged as revolutionary tools in recent years, but whether these sequencing data come from active transcription or pausing state genes, and the genome-wide phosphorylation status of rnapii in vivo, have not been studied. several genes in which rnapii is in the pausing state play key role in differentiation  <cit> ; therefore, understanding the correlation of rnaseq and rnapii phosphorylation state is very important. to evaluate the phosphorylation status of rnapii for all genes identified with rnaseq, we have to exclude free rnapii, in which ser <dig> and ser <dig> residues are not phosphorylated, and distinguish actively transcribed genes, for which both of ser <dig> and ser <dig> residues are phosphorylated, from pausing state genes, for which ser <dig> residues are only phosphorylated. evaluation of the relationship between the phosphorylation state of rnapii and mrna expression level will permit the identification of those genes that are actively transcribed and those that are pausing.

a variety of techniques have been developed to quantify and analyze gene expression levels, such as northern blotting, rt-qpcr, sage, and microarrays. recently emerged deep sequencers enable the analysis of mrna expression with much less bias compared with previous technologies, by reading tens of millions of tags in a single run   <cit> . rnaseq can clarify the amount of previously identified transcripts  <cit> , identify novel transcripts  <cit> , and analyze tissue-specific alternative splicing  <cit> . rnaseq is  <dig>  times more sensitive than microarrays for quantifying transcripts, and appears to be the best currently available tool for the evaluation of mrna  <cit> . however, rnaseq has its own limitations. one such limitation is the need for reference sequences. the deep sequencer examines 25- <dig> bp short fragments, unlike previous technologies, and sequences tens of millions of fragments in a single run. these fragments, also known as 'reads', are mapped to a reference transcriptome to identify gene expression. however, because the transcriptomes are incomplete, even for well-studied species such as human and mouse, analysis of rnaseq data is restricted by the reference sequence, and requires another calculation to identify novel transcripts. tophat  <cit>  does not depend on a reference transcriptome, and provided a new way to evaluate novel transcripts, including new splicing sites. in addition, cufflinks  <cit>  can map reads to a reference genome and identify all transcripts quantitatively per kilobase of nucleotides and considers splicing. the weak point of quantification by these mapping techniques is the comparatively short sequence tag used to map to the reference genome. success in mapping a sequence depends on the structure of the mrna; it may have homologs that have a common structure, which may introduce bias to the statistical results. therefore, to overcome these biases, it is necessary to use not only unique information, where one tag is mapped to one genomic region, but also multiple hit information, where one tag is mapped to two or more genomic regions. in tophat the parameter 'max multihits' controls how many regions one tag is allowed to map to, thereby optimizing mapping efficiency. however, a detailed evaluation of the influence of this parameter setting on the identification of mrna has not been performed.

thus, we used a deep sequencer to clarify how various mrna expression levels are controlled, by analyzing the regulation of rnapii through ctd phosphorylation. we categorized gene expression by identifying the phosphorylation control of rnapii for all genes. in addition, by combining these data with genome-wide gene expression data that were obtained from rnaseq using the optimized 'max multihits' parameter, we clarified the correlation between various mrna expressions and rnapii phosphorylation.

RESULTS
the accuracy of rnaseq is improved by permitting a small number of 'multihits'
to understand the transcriptional regulation mechanisms mediated by rnapii, it was necessary to evaluate mrna expression as accurately and quantitatively as possible. many mrnas possess high sequence similarity to their homologs in the genome, and when an increased number of 'max multihits', one of parameters of tophat, are permitted, we predicted that a greater number of genes would be identified. figure 1a shows rnaseq analysis data in hela cells, a popular human cell line for which there are abundant existing microarray data and reference sequence information, and shows the number of fpkm >  <dig> genes  identified with increasing max multihits. it is clear that higher numbers of genes are identified when 'max multihits' is increased, which means the sequences of two or more genes are taken forward for analysis. figure 1b shows spearman's correlation coefficient plotted against increasing 'max multihits' for three previously published expression microarray data sets: gsm <dig>  <cit> , gsm <dig>  <cit> , and gsm <dig>  <cit> , and the value of fpkm. though they are independent data sets, they show a high level of correlation that is not inferior compared with previously published analyses  <cit> . the correlation coefficient shows a tendency to rise with increasing 'max multihits'. however, when 'max multihits' becomes ten or more, both the number of identified genes  and the correlation coefficient between the expression microarray and rnaseq  hardly changes. this takes into account the fact that if a moderate multihit limit were not allowed, homologous sites would be excluded from rnaseq analysis. conversely, increasing multihits too far introduces the danger of counting genes that were not originally expressed. to identify any negative influences of increasing 'max multihits', we analyzed rnaseq data taking into account splicing. tophat performs an alignment to the genome by dividing the cdna sequence, and when it matches the genome, tophat presumes that place to be a splice junction. figure 1c shows the number of splice junctions found by tophat in known genes or fpkm >  <dig> genes plotted against increasing 'max multihits'. the proportion of splice sites found in genes other than already-known genes, or fpkm >  <dig> genes, increases as 'max multihits' increases. in addition, we examined the influence of increasing max multihits  on the number of genes present in a range of fpkm values . the figure shows that the only significant change was an increase in the number of genes in the fpkm 0- <dig>  group. from these results, we determined that the optimum setting for 'max multihits' was  <dig>  this identified the maximum number of genes, saturated the correlation between rnaseq and past expression microarray data sets, and reduced the possibility false positives. the accuracy of this optimization was reinforced by performing rt-pcr on genes with a small fpkm value  when 'max multihits' was set to  <dig>  and confirming the mrna expression .

the distribution of phosphorylated rnapii
it has been reported that rnapii transcribing activity correlates with the phosphorylation status of rnapii  <cit> . systematic and genome wide evaluation for the separation of pausing and active transcription states of rnapii has not been done with the most frequently used antibodies, which recognize the phosphorylation state of rnapii. some of these antibodies were characterized as having limited activity to specific phosphorylation states  <cit> . thus, we produced antibodies that specifically recognized ser-2-phosphorylated  or ser-5-phosphorylated  rnapii to analyze the relationship between transcriptional levels and rnapii phosphorylation for chipseq. stock et al.  showed that rnapii could be classified into hyperphosphorylated rnapii, in which ser <dig> and/or ser <dig> residues of the c-terminal domain are phosphorylated, and hypophosphorylated rnapii, in which neither were phosphorylated, by western blotting analysis. figure 2b shows that, in whole cell lysate of hela cells, the antibodies to ser2p and ser5p specifically recognized hyperphosphorylated rnapii, while antibody sc- <dig>  which was raised against the n-terminus of rnapii, recognized rnapii regardless of its phosphorylation status. monoclonal antibodies against the ctd can be influenced by the context of the antigen and the phosphorylation status of surrounding peptides  <cit> . thus, to confirm the specificity of our antibodies to phosphorylation of ser <dig> or ser <dig>  elisa was performed using the ctd repetitive sequence  phosphorylated at ser <dig>  ser <dig>  and ser <dig>  as an antigen . the antibody to ser2p recognized only ser2p of rnapii and was hardly influenced by phosphorylation of surrounding ser <dig> or ser <dig>  by contrast, the antibody against ser5p was influenced by ser7p on the downstream side, but not by ser2p. thus, our antibodies specifically recognized ser2p and ser5p of the ctd under suitable conditions. next, to evaluate the distribution of rnapii on the genome, chipseq  and deep sequencing to analyze dna-protein interactions) was performed with these antibodies. all genes containing a region that coincided with part of a peak that was judged to be a significant peak under the condition of false discovery rate  <  <dig>  and p-value <  <dig>  by peakseq  <cit>  were selected. for these genes, using a previous model of analysis  <cit> , detected gene body tags of chipseq were confirmed for all tags, and the total number of tags relative to input per one gene was calculated. figure 2c shows the antibody to ser5p exclusively detects high peaks around the transcription start site , and the antibody to ser2p detects high peaks over the entire gene body, particularly around the transcription end site . these results agreed with those of a previous study  <cit> . while relative tag count per one gene was almost the same for anti-ser2p and anti-ser5p around the tes, the total of relative tag count of ser5p around the tss was about ten times higher than that of ser2p. these results indicate that these antibodies could distinguish between hyperphosphorylated rnapii in the promoter proximal pausing state  and the active transcription state , and they also indicate that rnapii performs genome wide movement, as previously described  <cit> .

rnaseq can detect the expression of most genes, even in the "pausing" genes
in embryonic stem  cells, ser5-phosphorylated rnapii already exists on bivalent genes and pauses at the promoter proximal region  <cit> . this may suggest that pausing genes have a key role at the beginning of differentiation. however, to date, no report has established which phosphorylation state of rnapii corresponds to the gene expression identified by rnaseq. how many genes defined as 'pausing' genes actually express mrna and how much mrna from 'pausing' genes is transcribed is also still unclear. to examine how many active transcribing genes and pausing genes were identified by rnaseq, we constructed a venn diagram  from chipseq and rnaseq data. when the parameter of 'max multihits' was expanded, the genes detected only by rnaseq, but not by rnaseq and chipseq, increased . increasing multihits too far introduces the risk of counting silent genes; therefore, we used the optimized parameter 'max multihits = 10', and used genes with fpkm >  <dig>  peaks that conformed to p-value <  <dig>  and fdr <  <dig>  were assumed to be positive peaks using peakseq  <cit> , a peakcaller in chipseq. although an rnapii that pauses around the promoter could be bound only to the region upstream of the tss, a previous report demonstrated that a pausing rnapii extends over the coding region  <cit> . therefore, we defined that the association of ser2- and/or ser5-phosphorylated rnapii with a gene was positive only when a part of the positive peak corresponded to a part of the gene body, to prevent the risk that other genes were mistakenly selected from very gene-dense genomic regions. all  <dig>  human genes defined by refseq were evaluated. as a result,  <dig>  genes  of all genes had an fpkm >  <dig> in rnaseq or were judged to be positive for ser2- and/or ser5-phosphorylated rnapii in chipseq.

among  <dig>  genes in which ser2p is positive,  <dig>  genes  were assumed to be ser5p positive too. on the other hand, among the  <dig>  genes in which ser5p is positive,  <dig>  genes  are assumed to be ser2p positive. this result indicates that ser <dig> and ser <dig> of rnapii have to be sequentially phosphorylated for active transcription, as described previously  <cit> . however,  <dig>  genes  are ser2p positive only. when these genes are observed in the ucsc genome browser  , ser2p single positive genes appear in the comparatively gene-dense areas. moreover, when the chip-qpcr data were verified , for instance, for sox <dig>  which is judged to be a ser2p single positive, more ser2p was identified around the tss than around the tes, although the amount of ser2p did gradually increase towards the tes . these results suggest that ser2p single positive genes are false positives caused by the influence of surrounding genes or non-annotated transcripts in these regions. rnapii with an unphosphorylated ctd is first recruited to a promoter region and is then released when its ser <dig> is phosphorylated. active transcription is then initiated when ser <dig> is phosphorylated; however, rnapii keeps running until its termination, even if transcription ends  <cit> . this results in the deterioration of the resolution of chipseq and it may be one factor that causes false positives in gene-dense areas. to overcome this limitation, we set a criterion in which we scored a peak as positive only when the peak extended over the gene body. although this may affect the detection of rnapii that is in the state of promoter proximal pausing, ser5-phosphorylated rnapii that is pausing around the tss seems to be sufficiently detected when using this condition .

interestingly, rnaseq detected highly expressed genes not only in the state of active transcription , but also in the state of promoter proximal pausing , in the majority of fpkm >  <dig> genes. these results indicated that the phosphorylation of ser <dig> and ser <dig> correlates with gene expression in two stages. it also indicates that rnaseq, because of its high sensitivity, disregards the background epigenetic expression adjustment machinery associated with rnapii phosphorylation. some of the differentiation markers that were ser5p single positive showed low mrna expression in mouse embryonic stem cells  <cit> . however, we should take note of the expression of differentiation markers, as interpreted by rnaseq, in stem cells, because some of these genes could be identified as a result of rnaseq's high sensitivity.

among the  <dig>  genes which rnaseq judged to have an fpkm value >  <dig>   <dig>  genes  are ser2p and/or ser5p positive. the remaining  <dig>  genes  with fpkm >  <dig> in rnaseq, were identified as neither ser2p nor ser5p in chipseq. among  <dig>  genes which chipseq judged to be ser2p and/or ser5p positive,  <dig>  genes  were fpkm >  <dig> genes in rnaseq.

to further investigate functional relationship among pausing/active genes and gene functions, we analyzed significant associations using gene ontology  <cit>  and fishers' exact test. hundreds of go terms were calculated to be significant for active genes, and some of go terms associated with mitochondorial genes were judged to be significant for pausing genes. neither calculation seemed to give significant enrichment of specific genes, except for housekeepking genes.

gene expression levels reflect the level of phosphorylation of rnapii
to assess how much the phosphorylation of the ctd of rnapii correlates with genome-wide gene expression, we examined the amount of mrna expression by rnaseq in each part of the venn diagram . to validate results in independent data, expression microarray data sets, gsm <dig>  <cit> , gsm <dig>  <cit> , and gsm <dig>  <cit> , were evaluated at the same time. a heatmap  and a histogram  were then produced using the data of rnaseq and the expression microarrays. the amount of mrna expression was the highest in the area representing ser2p and ser5p double positive by chipseq, and decreased in the order of ser5p single positive, ser2p single positive, and ser2p/ser5p double negative, for fpkm >  <dig> genes . however, in genes judged to be fpkm =  <dig>  no high levels of expression were observed in any of the three expression microarray data sets. in addition, we extracted genes at random and performed qpcr to validate the data . qpcr generated similar results to figure 4a, and expression was confirmed for all of the genes judged fpkm >  <dig> by rnaseq. the amount of expression tended to decrease in the order of ser2p/ser5p double positive, ser5p single positive, ser2p single positive, and ser2p/ser5p double negative. moreover, qpcr confirmed the results for three of the six fpkm =  <dig> genes , despite their low expression levels . generally, rnaseq seems to be more sensitive than chipseq for detecting mrna, because sequence tags of rnaseq concentrate on exons, and more genes could be detected by rnaseq than by chipseq . however, the results shown in figure 4c indicate that some gene expressions that could not be confirmed with rnaseq were identified with chipseq. chipseq has the advantage of being able to map rnapii to an intron or utr that has few homologs and does not need to consider splicing; therefore, for certain genes, chipseq could have higher sensitivity than rnaseq. on the other hand, we also examined whether there was a correlation between the height of the peak of rnapii and the amount of mrna , but no such correlation was found. these data indicated that in terms of the quantification of the amount of mrna, rnaseq has a much higher sensitivity than chipseq.

rnapii status can be classified into three categories for transcribed genes
the analysis of expression data from rnaseq allowed us to classify genes into ser2p/ser5p double positive, single positive, and double negative, according to their different levels of expression. however, this was only for the data from peaks judged to have a p-value <  <dig>  and fdr <  <dig>  according to chipseq, and did not assess the comparison of accumulated amounts of tags in chipseq nor tags accumulated in genes outside of this peak. thus, to re-evaluate the phosphorylation state of rnapii between these gene categories, we did not utilize the threshold of p-value and fdr and counted tags in each part of the gene body that were covered by ser2p and/or ser5p and how frequently they existed in each gene. figure  <dig> and supplementary figure s <dig> show in which part of gene the ser5p-associated tags accumulated . the data for ser2p-associated tags are shown in figure 5b and supplementary figure s <dig> b, which assumes that gene body is from  <dig> to  <dig>  considering ser5p tag counts, although fpkm > 0/ser2p/ser5p genes and fpkm > 0/ser2p/ser5p genes have similar levels of ser5p tags around the tss, of the number of ser5p tags associated with ser5p single positive genes decreases around the tes compared with ser2p/ser5p double positive. even if only the existence of ser5p around the tss and tes is considered, the classification of our gene groups clearly distinguishes two states of rnapii, i.e. promoter proximal pausing and active transcription. moreover, the genes which rnaseq judged fpkm >  <dig> and chipseq judged not to be ser5p positive, because of the condition of p-value <  <dig>  and fdr <  <dig> , have ser5p around the tss compared with fpkm = 0/ser2p/ser5p genes, though at a low level, when the tags are collected and counted.

when tags were summed for genes with fpkm > 0/ser2p/ser5p, the number of ser2p tags tended to be high . however, for these genes, the tag count outside of the gene  for ser2p and ser5p are also higher than for other gene categories, and this may indicate that they were picked up from the background noise generated by surrounding genes. the ser5p tags showed a small peak around the tss of these genes , and when the background was excluded, the shape of the graph obtained from fpkm > 0/ser2p/ser5p genes was approximately the same as that from fpkm > 0/ser2p/ser5p. these results suggest that the genes whose expression is confirmed by rnaseq can be classified into three categories by combining chipseq data concerning ser2p/ser5p: 'high pausing, high elongation ', 'high pausing, low elongation ', and 'low pausing, low elongation '.

control of mrna expression is correlated to phased phosphorylation of ser <dig> and ser5
the amount of mrna expression of the genes grouped by phased phosphorylation of ser <dig> and ser <dig> of rnapii had a tendency to increase with the level of phosphorylation, leading the predicted three category mode: 'high pausing, high elongation', 'high pausing, low elongation', and 'low pausing, low elongation'. thus, a gene could be categorized by its fpkm value using logistic regression analysis.  <dig>  genes judged to have fpkm values >  <dig> by rnaseq became the object of the analysis. as mentioned before, false positives could arise by the influence of surrounding genes, and was thought to be about  <dig> genes ; therefore, these genes were counted in this analysis in addition to the ser2p/ser5p double negative group. whole model test and parameter estimates are shown in table  <dig>  in addition, the phosphorylation status of ser <dig> and/or ser <dig> of rnapii was observed for each gene examined according to the fpkm value, and a probability plot was produced . as the value of fpkm obtained by rnaseq rises, the probability that rnapii is phosphorylated  rises. finally, half of the genes with an fpkm value of about  <dig> belong to the 'low pausing, low elongation' group, in which the existence of phosphorylated rnapii cannot be proven. however, among the genes for which the existence of phosphorylated rnapii could be proven, more than half of the genes for which the fpkm value was one or less were ser5p single positive. the probability of ser5p single positive genes increases until their values of fpkm rise to about  <dig> . it can be said that the genes whose fpkm is relatively high have an unexpected high possibility of being judged as 'pausing' genes. the number of genes associated with ser2p/ser5p double positive rnapii increased with increasing fpkm value, finally reaching  <dig> percent or more. our analysis presumes a qualitative value, like the phosphorylation of ser <dig> and ser <dig>  from a various amounts of gene expression . although each group's borderline, which inclines sideways in the probability plot of the logistic regression analysis, indicates the existence of another factor, it seems that the phosphorylation of rnapii correlates with the gene expression level. this is the first model of various mrna expressions using epigenetic factors. ultimately, the amount of mrna expression could be explained using a similar model in combination with other epigenetic factors, such as transcription factors and histone modification.

CONCLUSIONS
we studied the association between mrna expression level and rnapii phosphorylation state in hela cells using a deep sequencer for rnaseq and chipseq analysis. during verification to improve the accuracy of rnaseq, we found that the correlation between rnaseq and past expression microarray data could be increased by adjusting the 'max multihits' parameter. we optimized this parameter such that it minimized the risk of reading genes that are not simultaneously expressed. we also produced an antibody against the phosphorylated form of rnapii, which allowed the genome-wide visualization of the state of rnapii phosphorylation using chipseq. rnaseq and chipseq showed a very high correlation, and the existence of rnapii on approximately 82% of genes that were detected with rnaseq was confirmed in chipseq. in addition, when we examined the relationship between the phosphorylation state of rnapii and the level of mrna expression, phosphorylation of both ser <dig> and ser <dig> of rnapii was confirmed for almost all highly expressing genes. when only ser <dig> of pnapii was phosphorylated, low mrna expression was detectable by rnaseq, in spite of the pausing state. moreover, when tag counts of ser5p were counted for genes identified only with rnaseq, the existence of a slightly higher level of ser5p was detected compared with the negative control. this indicated that transcriptional adjustment is performed in two stages: promoter escape and active elongation. we also provide a hypothesis that gene expression can be classified into three groups according to the phosphorylation state of rnapii.
