BACKGROUND
verticillium dahliae kleb.  is a ubiquitous soil-borne fungus that penetrates plant roots, enters the plant vascular system, and causes vascular wilt diseases collectively known as verticillium wilts  <cit> . v. dahliae can infect more than  <dig> plant species, including important crops, flowers, vegetables, trees, and shrubs, causing economically significant losses each year  <cit> .

verticillium wilt is a threat to smoke tree  stands in china. smoke trees are of primary importance as ornamentals, highly valued for the brilliant red leaf scenery that these trees provide in the beijing region during autumn, especially in fragrant hills park, a  <dig> hectare forest park in beijing. vascular wilt in smoke tree was reported in fragrant hills park as early as  <dig>  and subsequently the disease spread to other smoke tree growing areas in beijing  <cit> . symptoms of vascular wilt in smoke trees include stunted growth of the stem, early senescence of leaves, and early mortality. without adequate control, the famous “red leaf scenery” of fragrant hills and other areas is threatened by the detrimental effects of the verticillium wilt. currently available fungicides and other control measures are not effective in controlling the disease due in part to the ability of the fungus to survive for long periods in soil.

the survival of v. dahliae in soil depends on the production of melanized, multicellular structures known as microsclerotia   <cit> . melanin deposition and a thickened cell wall enable the ms of the pathogen to resist uv irradiation, temperature extremes, enzymatic lysis, and fungicidal activities  <cit> . the ms can survive in soils in the absence of a host plant for as long as 10 years, and are the primary infectious propagules of the verticillium wilt disease  <cit> . the ms germinate to form hyphae in the soil, and penetrate the plant roots, where the fungus colonizes the xylem tissue of the plant vascular system. as wilt symptoms progress, v. dahliae produces ms in dying plant tissues, which are returned to the soil to initiate new primary infections. thus, the production of ms represents a significant developmental event in the life cycle of v. dahliae <cit> .

the morphological events of ms formation have been well studied by both light and electron microscopy . in the early stages of ms development, hyphae become swollen, vacuolated, and form numerous septa. subsequently, clusters of hyphal cells form in the swollen hyphae that resemble the microsclerotial initial  <cit> . in the final phase of ms formation, melanin particles are extruded into the interhyphal spaces of the microsclerotium, and peripheral microsclerotial cells are killed by autolysis  <cit> . the genes involved in melanin biosynthesis have been identified and their functions have been characterized . the results indicate that melanin is necessary for the formation of fully functional ms  <cit> . however, little is known about the molecular pathways involved in ms formation.

genome-wide identification of genes expressed during ms formation is a first step in elucidating the pathways and molecular mechanisms underlying ms formation in v. dahliae. methods for genome-wide expression analyses include expressed sequence tag  analysis  <cit> , suppression subtractive hybridization   <cit> , serial analysis of gene expression   <cit> , massive parallel signature sequencing   and rna-sequencing  . next-generation sequencing  technologies have provided new platforms for comprehensive transcriptional studies . transcriptome sequencing is an efficient means to generate transcriptomic data, and rna-seq is one approach transcriptome profiling that provides highly accurate measurements of gene expression by counting the number of sequencing reads, which map to a genome or annotated transcripts  <cit> , and further enable genome-wide identification of coding sequences, gene structure, alternative splicing  <cit> . transcriptomic data produced by rna-seq methods have increased our understanding of gene expression involved in growth and development of pathogenic fungi . for example, transcriptional analysis of appressorium formation in the rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae revealed the role of autophagy, lipid metabolism and melanin biosynthesis, and a pmk <dig> mapk kinase as a key global regulator in appressorium differentiation  <cit> .

resources available to facilitate transcriptome analyses of ms formation include transcript data for  <dig>  genes and the  <dig>  mb genome sequence for v. dahliae, strain vdls. <dig>   <cit> . subsequent characterizations of this sequence resource also provide useful information to place transcriptomic studies in context. for example, comparison of the genome structure of v. dahliae strain vdls. <dig> to that of the verticillium alfalfae strain vams. <dig> revealed four lineage-specific  regions of about 350 kb in length present in vdls. <dig> but absent in the vams. <dig> strain. the vdls. <dig> ls regions encoded  <dig> predicted genes, some of which had been associated with virulence and host range specificity. only about  <dig> % the ls genes encode predicted secreted proteins, and the ls regions were nearly devoid of “housekeeping” type genes  <cit> . additional comparative genomics analyses of multiple v. dahliae strains indicated that the ls regions are diverse in length and gene content, enriched for in planta-expressed genes, and that chromosomal rearrangements associated with ls regions in v. dahliae are common  <cit> . an additional valuable resource includes expressed sequence tag  libraries previously used to identify expressed genes in v. dahliae during pathogenic growth and ms development in v. dahliae <cit> . neumann and dobinson  <cit>  obtained about  <dig> ests, many of which corresponded to melanin biosynthetic enzymes, exclusive to the developing ms culture type. the analysis of genes associated with specific ests has accelerated molecular characterization of ms formation. recently, duressa et al. performed a rna-seq analysis between ms producing cultures and those not producing ms in v. dahliae, revealing over  <dig> significantly expressed genes involved in melanin synthesis and other processes  <cit> . while this work focused on up- or down-regulation of gene expression between these two culture types, the focus was not on assessing gene expression associated with gradual developmental changes during ms formation.

in addition to those resources, several individual genes involved in ms formation have been characterized in v. dahliae. vdh <dig>  encoding a class ii hydrophobin, is one of the many genes significantly differentially expressed during ms formation, and vdh <dig> is required for ms formation of v. dahliae <cit> . vmk <dig>  encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase, modulates ms formation  <cit> ; mutation of vdgarp <dig>  encoding a glutamic acid-rich protein, significantly delays development of melanized ms  <cit> . the non-ls copy of vdhog <dig>  a homolog of the high osmolarity glycerol response protein kinase, positively regulates ms formation , and the g protein β subunit negatively controls ms formation  <cit> . functional characterizations of these individual genes have provided valuable insight into the genetic control of ms formation, yet there remain major gaps in our understanding of the molecular determinants that trigger and regulate ms formation in v. dahliae.

the objectives of this work were to  examine developmental stage-specific gene expression during ms formation in v. dahliae and  to identify genes differentially expressed in this developmental process. to accomplish these aims, extensive microscopy analyses were carried out to initially characterize four different stages of ms development in a smoke tree strain of v. dahliae. rna-seq analyses were employed to analyze transcript profiles of  <dig>  genes  and global patterns of gene expression in v. dahliae using four identified ms developmental stages as reference points. this enabled identification genes significantly differentially expressed during stages of ms development, revealing major metabolic processes and signal pathways associated with ms development in v. dahliae. elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that govern ms formation in v. dahliae may be useful in designing novel strategies to control verticillium wilt, not only for the smoke tree pathogen, but also related pathogenic strains and other verticillium spp. that produce ms  <cit> .

RESULTS
microscopic analyses of ms development
the dynamics of morphogenesis and pigment production were examined by light microscopy during ms development to chart cellular changes relative to gene expression during ms formation. six stages were selected for these analyses based on phenotypic changes that were observed during ms formation. the stages of ms formation, as determined by light microscopy, were named ms <dig>  ms <dig>  ms <dig> and ms <dig> . at  <dig> hpi  or at ms <dig>  cell clustering and swelling resembling the microsclerotial initial was observed at the margins of the cellulose membrane. this initial stage of ms development  gave rise to small masses of microsclerotial initial cells  that were bright yellow. at  <dig> hpi , developing ms were easily visible, and microsclerotial mass consisting of an accumulation of brown and lightly-pigmented cells appeared on the membrane . at  <dig> hpi , many pigmented ms were visible and the microsclerotial mass consisted of an accumulation of dark cells across the entire membrane. at  <dig> dpi , mature and darkly pigmented ms were apparent. the individual cells of mature ms also possessed a thickened cell wall surrounded by melanin. in addition to these four stages of ms development, two additional morphological stages of the fungal conidia  and germinating conidia  were sampled for rna-seq and comparisons of differential gene expression.figure  <dig>

overview of the v. dahliae transcriptome
the pipeline of rna-seq analysis is shown in figure 1b, rna libraries derived from the samples were pair-end sequenced using an illumina high-throughput sequencing platform. after stringent quality checks and tag cleaning, we obtained a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads from the six libraries with an average of  <dig> , <dig> reads in each sample, ranging from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> reads . the v. dahliae  genome assembly and the  <dig>  predicted genes of this strain were used as a reference sequence   <cit> . in total,  <dig> % of the total reads  from all six samples were aligned to the genome of v. dahliae, strain vdls. <dig> by tophat with less than 2 bp mismatches  <cit> . the total mapped reads represented about 423-fold coverage of the genome and 955-fold coverage of the annotated v. dahliae transcriptome. approximately  <dig> % of total reads did not map to the genome, likely reflecting either sequence differences between strains , gaps in the current assembly, sequencing errors, or alternative splicing that exists in the reference genome of the broad institute.table  <dig>

gene expression levels were determined by fragments per kilobase of gene per million mapped fragments . mapping revealed that  <dig>   predicted genes were expressed, ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>   among the six libraries . approximately  <dig> %  – <dig> %  of genes were expressed with fpkm > <dig>  expression patterns identified by rna-seq were validated by reverse transcription quantitative real-time pcr  analysis of selected genes from each group. analysis of the rna-seq and qrt-pcr data sets revealed correlation between the two . to examine the correlation of gene expression patterns among the six samples, the pearson relationships of paired samples were calculated with fpkm of all expressed genes. samples sharing similar gene expression patterns were clustered together according to the pearson correlation. this correlation analysis revealed that stages ms <dig>  ms <dig> and ms <dig> shared similar expression patterns as stage gc in the larger clade, while the expression patterns in stages ms <dig> and co were distinct from each other. furthermore, the pattern of gene expression in stages ms1-ms <dig> and gc clustered together, while the stage of co was in a distinct clade . principal component analysis  was employed to examine the six samples according to their gene expression profiles. principal components  <dig> and  <dig> explained  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the variance, respectively. stage co was distinct from the other five samples. ms <dig>  ms <dig> and ms <dig> were clustered together and belonged to a cluster with gc. stage ms <dig> was distinct from stages ms1- <dig> . therefore, the pca result was consistent with the hierarchical clustering.table  <dig>

clustering analysis reveals enrichment of particular gene categories expressed during ms formation
to elucidate dynamic changes in the v. dahliae transcriptome during ms formation, the clustering affinity search technique  was employed to generate clusters  <cit> . cast analyses of the  <dig>  expressed genes revealed  <dig> clusters, with gene numbers within clusters ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  most of the clusters had no more than  <dig> genes. however, each of the top  <dig> clusters contained more than  <dig> genes , and contained about  <dig> % of the total detected genes, illustrating the major gene expression clusters . increased transcript levels were observed in clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in stages ms1-ms <dig> as compared with stage co, and comprised  <dig> % of the total expressed genes  whereas genes in clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were down-regulated in stages ms1-ms <dig> compared to stage co, and comprised  <dig> % of the total expressed genes.figure  <dig>

according to the gene expression pattern described earlier, and the cluster analysis results, a large variety of genes were differentially expressed during ms formation. to ascribe gene functions to those genes displaying differential expression patterns, gene ontology  enrichment analysis was performed for genes from the top  <dig> clusters shown in figure 3b by blast2go with fisher’s exact test, and compared with the whole genome background filtered with false discovery rate  correction . the results of enriched go terms revealed an overrepresentation of different gene functions in certain clusters. for example, genes encoding protein metabolic processes, such as ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, primary metabolic processes, and stress responses, were enriched in cluster  <dig>  which was expressed at increased levels at each stage compared to the co stage . the genes in cluster  <dig> function mainly in signaling pathways, and increased in expression until ms <dig>  at which point there were declining levels of expression . genes of cluster  <dig> were functionally enriched in transport. the functional enrichment of cluster  <dig> revealed cofactor metabolic processes, oxidation-reduction processes, and chromosome segregation. however, analyses did not reveal functional enrichment in other clusters, such as clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the full list of enriched go terms and corresponding genes are provided in additional file 3: table s <dig> 

several gene families identified in other fungi, including in v. dahliae, have established functional roles of importance in growth, development, and pathogenesis. to further understand the expression patterns of these gene families,  <dig> different families or groups were selected and analyzed further . the results of this analysis illustrated diverse expression patterns, but relative to the gc stage, there was up-regulation of genes encoding products involved in fatty acid oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle , calcium and gpcr-mediated signaling , selected classes of transcription factors , as well as secreted proteins and transporters  during ms formation . as shown, selected branches of energy production pathways including glycolysis/gluconeogensis, tca cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid oxidation and glyoxylate cycle were up-regulated in ms formation compared to the co stage , while genes encoding proteins typical of signaling pathways, such as mapk pathway members were slightly up-regulated during ms formation . the genome-wide expression analysis of transcription factors of v. dahliae suggested that certain transcription factors were also down-regulated in gc stages and up-regulated in stages ms1-ms <dig> . furthermore, more than  <dig> genes encoding secreted proteins showed an up-regulated pattern of expression in stages ms1-ms <dig> ; some of these genes were highly expressed  in ms formation, and  <dig> of these genes encoded small, cysteine-rich secreted proteins  .figure  <dig>

gene expression profile during ms development
rna-seq provides digital readings of gene expression levels  <cit> . to determine which genes were expressed at each developmental stage, we examined the dynamics of gene expression throughout ms development in the genome-wide transcriptomic data. the distribution of gene expression values was different among the six stages studied. nearly  <dig> % of the expressed genes were detected with low expression values  in stages co and gc, while only  <dig> %  were detected in stages ms1-ms <dig>  suggesting that many genes expressed with 0 < fpkm ≤ <dig> in co or gc stages were elevated transcript levels during the ms formation. however, the number of genes with moderate expression values  or high expression values  in stages ms1-ms <dig> were increased relative to stages co or gc, suggesting up-regulation of genes to meet the requirements of ms formation . the number of expressed genes with fpkm > <dig> were gradually increased, from  <dig>   to  <dig>   .

to determine which genes were differentially expressed during ms formation, pairwise comparisons were performed using counts of the significantly up- or down-regulated  genes. the number of significantly up-regulated genes was dramatically increased in stages ms1-ms4; however, the number of significantly down-regulated genes was reduced compared with the co stage . ms <dig> represented the stage with the largest number of significantly up-regulated genes and the least number of down-regulated genes compared with the co stage, consistent with the distribution of gene expression at this stage. we further examined the expression level and log <dig>  distribution analysis of genes that were significantly differentially expressed at ms1-ms <dig> and gc stages compared with stage co . the number of genes with log <dig>  >  <dig> in each stage was consistent with that of significantly up-regulated genes. ms1-ms <dig> stages consisted of more genes with log <dig>  > <dig> as compared with stage co . using this approach,  <dig> significantly up-regulated genes and  <dig> significantly down-regulated genes  were identified , and these were considered as candidate genes involved in ms development.figure  <dig>

go analysis was performed for the  <dig> genes significantly differentially expressed in ms formation compared to the co stage to examine potential molecular mechanisms regulating ms formation. of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes were annotated with go terms. go analysis of the up-regulated genes identified processes related to metabolism, catabolism, transport, and the functions related to catalytic, transporter, hydrolase activities . in addition, go enrichment analysis was performed with the  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes compared with the whole genome with p value < <dig> . genes significantly up-regulated represented functional enrichment in structural molecules , peptidase , protein kinase , hydrolase  activities, and enrichment in processes including cellular carbohydrate metabolism , cellular protein metabolism , ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis , macromolecule biosynthesis  and cellular component biogenesis . on the other hand, the  <dig> significantly down-regulated genes represented functional enrichment in transporter  and oxidoreductase  activities, and in the transport processes  . in conclusion, the  <dig> up-regulated genes in the ms stages were mainly involved in protein metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and biosynthetic processes, including the macromolecule  biosynthesis.table  <dig>

differential expression of ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism and cell death-associated genes during ms development
some of the ms cells undergo autolysis or death during ms formation in v. dahliae <cit> . according to the go categories and enrichment analysis, there were more than twenty genes involved in protein metabolic processes, most of which participated in proteolysis. among the genes involved in protein metabolic processes, five were involved in proteasome formation, and included vdag_ <dig> , vdag_ <dig> , vdag_ <dig> , vdag_ <dig> , vdag_ <dig>  . genes encoding products involved in protein modification processes were also enhanced during ms formation, such as ubiquitination, important for proteasome-mediated degradation of proteins  <cit> .

we identified  <dig> genes involved in ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic processes in v. dahliae using homology searches . expression profiles of the ubiquitin-dependent genes showed that almost  <dig> % of these genes were up-regulated during ms formation , suggesting that ubiquitination and subsequent protein degradation might play an important role in ms formation. the autophagy-related genes atg <dig>  atg <dig>  atg <dig>  atg <dig> and atg <dig> are involved in ubiquitin-like protein  degradation processes  <cit> . orthologous genes were identified in v. dahliae, such as vdag_ <dig> , vdag_ <dig> , vdag_ <dig> , vdag_ <dig> , vdag_ <dig> . figure 6b shows the expression patterns in which the genes of the left branch of the ubl protein degradation process showed small changes in expression during ms formation, while those genes on the right branch showed relatively large expression changes, especially vdag_ <dig>  these results suggest that the proteolysis process was induced during ms formation, potentially contributing to protein degradation during ms formation.figure  <dig>

other genes involved in autophagy and cell death in v. dahliae were identified. in total,  <dig> autophagy genes were identified in v. dahliae, which were then divided into two groups, nonselective autophagy and selective autophagy  <cit> . expression profiles of these genes showed stable expression patterns across developmental stages examined, except vdag_ <dig>  and vdag_ <dig> , which were up-regulated during ms formation . in addition, some genes encoding the het domain were up-regulated during ms formation in v. dahliae, although over  <dig> % of the het-related genes were neither up- nor down-regulated during ms formation . vegetative incompatibility is an apoptotic-type heterokaryon incompatibility, and proteins containing a het domain mediate the apoptotic-type pathway . potentially, cell death observed during ms formation in v. dahliae <cit>  is regulated through mechanisms that also mediate vegetative incompatibility.

analyses of lineage-specific gene expression during ms development
there exist four lineage specific  regions in v. dahliae strain vdls. <dig>  and these regions are of interest since they encode  <dig> predicted protein-encoding genes that play important roles such as secondary metabolism, transcription, and pathotype specificity  <cit> . to reveal changes in the expression of genes located in ls regions in the transcriptome during ms formation, the global gene expression profile in the v. dahliae genome in the six samples was visualized by circos  <cit> . the genome-wide analyses of gene expression indicated that the majority of genes were expressed with fpkm values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  and the expressed genes were uniformly distributed in the v. dahliae genome . however, the non-expressed genes were mainly distributed in the supercontig  <dig>  supercontig  <dig> and supercontig  <dig> on chr  <dig>  and supercontig  <dig> on chr  <dig> in all the six stages . interestingly, the four ls regions in vdls. <dig> are located within these particular supercontigs .figure  <dig>

transcription factors encoded within the ls regions potentially regulate gene expression of not only ls-associated genes, but also other core genes in the genome of v. dahliae that have roles in ms development. we followed the expression patterns of bzip transcription factors to ascertain a potential role of these genes in regulating development in v. dahliae. among  <dig> bzip transcription factor-encoding genes of v. dahliae, strain vdls. <dig>  five genes  are located within the ls regions and were separated in a distinct clade with other bzip transcription factors in a phylogenetic analysis , similar to those results previously reported  <cit>  all five homologs of these ls-encoded genes, with the exception of vdag_ <dig>  were not differentially expressed during ms formation in the smoke tree strain of v. dahliae. furthermore these genes are verticillium-specific .

expression profiles of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and melanin biosynthesis during ms formation
genes involved in carbohydrate metabolic process were significantly up-regulated during the ms formation based on go annotation analysis. to further study the dynamics of hexose metabolism during ms formation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, tricarboxylic acid, pentose phosphate and glyoxylate pathways were examined . expression profiles showed that genes controlling hexose metabolism pathways were differentially expressed during ms formation . for example, two key enzyme encoding genes vdag_ <dig>  and vdag_ <dig>  in glycolysis were significantly up-regulated during ms1-ms <dig> stages, indicative of an up-regulation of glycolysis during ms formation. conversely, two genes that are critical for gluconeogensis  were down-regulated.

acetyl-coa is an important intermediate product of metabolism and plays a very important role in the cell’s energy requirement, metabolic pathways, and appressorium formation in rice blast disease  <cit> . rna-seq analyses of genes expressed in ms formation revealed up-regulation of four genes in strain xs <dig> of v. dahliae  that are candidate genes involved in catalyzing the pyruvate to generate acetyl-coa, suggesting an increase in the amount of acetyl-coa during ms formation.

the polyketide pathway is one of the most important metabolic processes involved in the growth, development, and pathogenicity in filamentous fungi. melanin is a prevalent polyketide in pathogenic fungi, and melanin biosynthesis is well studied in pathogenic fungi  <cit> . genes involved in melanin biosynthesis were identified in v. dahliae by homology searches, including polyketide synthase , scytalone dehydratase  and hydroxynaphthalene reductase . expression profiles of these and other genes encoding enzymes of the melanin biosynthesis pathway are shown in figure  <dig>  vdag_ <dig>  vdag_ <dig> and vdag_ <dig> homologs in strain xs <dig> were all highly expressed and significantly up-regulated  during the ms formation as compared with stage co . the expression profile was consistent with phenotypic observations of ms formation, during which the accumulation of melanin was dramatically increased at stages ms <dig> and ms <dig> . decreases in the expression levels of vdag_ <dig>  vdag_ <dig>  vdag_ <dig> and vdag_ <dig> were observed in ms <dig> as compared to ms <dig> in strain xs <dig>  at the completion of melanin deposition in the ms .figure  <dig>

discovery of alternative splicing
alternative splicing  for the creation of new gene transcripts can increase regulatory complexity and control of developmental programs in higher organisms. a software splicingviewer  <cit>  was employed to identify putative as events in the six different developmental stages of v. dahliae that were examined in this study. this analysis tool enabled detection of potential splicing junctions and identification of seven putative types of as events, such as skipped exons , mutually exclusive exons , alternative 5′ splicing sites , alternative 3′ splicing sites , alternative first exons , alternative last exons  and retained intron   <cit> . more than  <dig> %  expressed genes were detected in the existing as events representing  <dig>  as events in the six stages examined . four primary types of as events, namely, retained intron , skipped exons , alternative 5′ splicing sites , alternative 3′ splicing sites  were common in v. dahliae. the other three types of as events were sporadic, and mutually exclusive exons  were rarely observed in v. dahliae. furthermore,  <dig> %  of the as genes produced more than two isoforms . more than ten alternative transcripts were identified for a single gene, such as the vdag_ <dig> homolog, encoding a cysteine-rich-protein that contains  <dig> exons. there were  <dig> different isoforms of vdag_ <dig> that were observed, as concluded from all the six developmental stages examined. over  <dig> % of the as events were ri in all stages, and the other as events consisted of less than  <dig> %, respectively , suggesting that the ri was the most common event observed in v. dahliae. we performed rt-pcr to validate the ri events of three genes, i.e. for homologs of vdag_ <dig>  vdag_ <dig>  vdag_ <dig>  all three genes exhibited alternatively spliced transcripts, consistent with the results of rna-seq .figure  <dig>

discussion
the formation of ms in v. dahliae is critically important for survival and propagation of this fungus, representing a significant developmental event in the disease cycle. the long term survival of the ms in soil poses a major obstacle for effective control of verticillium wilts through cultural practices such as crop rotation. the structure of the ms, including a thickened cell wall and heavy melanin deposition, protects the pathogen from various environmental assaults and even fungicidal activity  <cit> . this study was undertaken to begin elucidating of the genetics and biochemical processes underpinning ms development, which may yield insight into control strategies to combat vascular wilt disease of smoke trees, and other plant hosts of economic or aesthetic importance.

in this work, rna-seq was performed on samples from six developmentally distinct stages, ranging from conidia  and germinating conidia  through four stages of ms formation and maturation . due to the actual difficulties of obtaining ms from real condition such as in plant or soil, especially during ms development, we obtained ms in vitro. the rationale for this approach was to define ms-associated gene expression during ms formation. analyses of ms formation on an artificial surface ensured that gene expression data were exclusively from the fungus, rather than the smoke tree host. it is also technically difficult to sample different developmental stages of ms in plant tissues and soil. likewise, mj neumann and kf dobinson  <cit>  employed a method to collect ms samples for studies of gene expression during ms development in v. dahliae using est analyses from in vitro cultures. given the limitations of est-based analyses and advancements in ngs technologies, the dynamics of transcriptome expression during ms formation were studied using the relatively new ngs technology of rna-seq. this technology enabled identification of metabolic pathways of interest, as well as alternative splicing. analyses of these transcriptome data revealed that this was an effective approach, providing an extensive catalog of expression values over the range of six distinct developmental stages. moreover, of the  <dig>  million sequenced reads,  <dig>  million reads uniquely mapped to the genome without mismatch, and  <dig>  million reads mapped perfectly to the annotated genes of the v. dahliae strain vdls. <dig> sequence.

the increased expression of particular genes observed in this study was expected; including those involved in melanin biosynthesis, or selected genes that were previously identified as important in ms formation. melanin biosynthetic genes in v. dahliae were expressed at relatively high levels during ms formation consistent with the culture phenotype  observed. in addition, vdh <dig> , a hydrophobin protein-encoding gene, is involved in ms formation, and vdh <dig> is specifically expressed in developing microsclerotia  <cit> . in concurrence with the results of that study, the expression level of vdh <dig> was significantly increased in the stages of ms1-ms <dig>  especially in ms <dig> and ms <dig> . the finding of the developmentally regulated expression of vdh <dig> in this study may also explain the lack of differential expression of vdh <dig> observed in rna-seq analyses of gene expression in which only 10 day ms-producing cultures and 10 day cultures not forming ms were compared  <cit> . in the study of duressa et al.  <cit>  stages equivalent to ms <dig> or ms <dig> were not analyzed.

analyses of go functional category enrichment indicated that carbohydrate and protein metabolic processes, and ribonucleoprotein biosynthetic processes were significantly enriched among up-regulated genes, while transport processes were significantly enriched among down-regulated genes. functional classification revealed that peptidase, protein kinase, and hydrolase activities were significantly up-regulated during ms1-ms <dig> stages. among the carbohydrate metabolic processes, several genes involved in energy production were enriched; such as vdag_ <dig> , vdag_ <dig> , and vdag_ <dig> . these results suggested that these differentially expressed genes are involved in a broad range of physiological functions, especially in proteolysis, protein modification, during ms formation. enrichment of peptidase activity may also accompany processes associated with cell death or autolysis in ms formation  <cit> . on the other hand, most genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, such as the polysaccharide lyase and carbohydrate esterase gene families, showed low expression levels during ms formation. the carbohydrate-binding module  <dig> gene family, which is significantly enriched in v. dahliae relative to most other fungi  <cit> , also showed low expression at the ms developmental stages analyzed in this study.

stage-specific differences were extensive in v. dahliae at the gene regulatory level during ms development. among the genes annotated in v. dahliae, strain vdls. <dig>  dozens of genes that were differentially expressed during ms formation were identified . this indicated that ms-stage-specific gene regulation occurs at the transcriptome level during ms formation. these data provided a basis for further assessing the roles of individual genes, especially those ms-specific genes potentially involved in cellular differentiation and ms formation.

the four major lineage-specific  regions identified in the genome of strain vdls. <dig> of v. dahliae are thought to contribute to adaptation to different host niches  <cit>  and encode virulence factors  <cit> . while the total ls region contents differ between strains of v. dahliae <cit> , a total of  <dig> genes are located in the four ls regions of strain vdls.17; and some of these genes encode proteins involved in lipid metabolism, plant-fungal interactions, and transcriptional regulation  <cit> . interestingly, analyses of three est libraries produced under low nutrient or complete medium revealed the ls genes of vdls. <dig> were significantly up-regulated compared to genes in the genome core sequence. furthermore, recent work indicates enrichment for in planta-expressed ls genes in the v. dahliae strain jr <dig>  <cit> . in this study, the majority of genes in ls regions of v. dahliae were either not expressed or showed low expression in ms <dig> to ms <dig>  suggesting that genes of the ls regions are suppressed at the developmental stages examined relative to those of the genome core, and also may be influenced by the differing gene content of ls regions between different strains examined. consistent with this hypothesis, expression of vdag_ <dig>  encoding a high osmolarity glycerol response  protein, and located in ls region  <dig>  was not detected in all six developmental stages examined in this study. the other copy of the hog <dig> gene  from the smoke tree strain resulted in significantly reduced and delayed production and developmental progress of ms in vitro . additional analyses revealed that genes encoding ls region-associated bzip transcription factors were not expressed, or showed low expression in the stages of ms formation, while other bzip transcription factors located in non-ls regions were expressed during ms formation.

the rna-seq analysis provided useful information on alternatively spliced transcripts in v. dahliae. these analyses are critical for studies that aim to assess gene regulation and gene function in ms development and in other developmental processes. the number of genes undergoing as were mainly estimated based on overlapping introns, which does not take intron retention and splice junctions into account  <cit> . over  <dig> % as events were due to intron retention. as in other fungi, such as aspergillus oryzae and ustilago maydis, ri is the predominant form of as  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  genes underwent as events, while there was an average of  <dig>  genes that underwent as events in each stage. this suggests that stage-specific genes undergo as at different times during ms development. further screens of these genes are required to increase understanding the role of as in the development and pathogenesis in the smoke tree wilt fungus. assembly of transcription from short sequencing reads remains a computational challenge. therefore, it is essential to validate the predicted as events by laboratory and field experiments.

in summary, an rna-seq strategy was employed to gain insight on the biology and molecular basis of ms development of smoke tree vascular wilt fungus, v. dahliae. functional categories of genes such as those involved in carbohydrate metabolism, proteolysis, and cell death were differentially regulated during ms formation. comprehensive, high-resolution gene expression maps enabled detection of a large number of as events that provide a key resource for further studies that aim to understand the molecular underpinnings of ms development and other developmental processes in this fungus. further, de novo assembly of transcripts from rna-seq data represents a potential avenue for gene annotation . the analysis of splicing events detected herein may shed light on alternate splicing in v. dahliae, and help to understand the roles of as in ms formation and other developmental processes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have conducted a rna-seq analysis of the ms developmental process in smoke tree wilt fungus v. dahliae xs <dig>  a global view of gene expression profiles and a large-scale stage-specific transcriptome alterations during ms development are revealed. further analysis show that genes involved in glycolytic pathway, melanin biosynthesis and protein catabolism are dramatically up-regulated in ms stages. in addition, a large number of as events are detected among co, gc and ms stages. our results provides a key resource for understanding the biological and molecular basis of ms development of v. dahliae.
