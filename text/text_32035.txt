BACKGROUND
cold temperature is an environmental factor that plays an important role in plant growth and development. temperate plants have developed mechanisms to adapt to periods of low non-freezing temperatures, enabling these plants to survive subsequent freezing temperatures. this process is called cold acclimation  <cit> . cold acclimation is a complex process that involves physiological, biochemical and molecular modifications  <cit> . hundreds of genes have been shown to have altered expression levels during cold acclimation  <cit> . these alterations enable the plant to withstand freezing by creating a chronic response that protects the integrity of the cellular membranes, enhances anti-oxidative mechanisms and accumulates molecular cryoprotectants  <cit> .

under normal conditions, cold acclimation is initiated by the cold temperatures of late fall and early winter, when fruit trees lack fruits. similar cold temperatures have been used in the fruit industry to store fruits for prolonged periods of time. these temperatures inhibit fruit ripening, thereby extending fruit postharvest life. despite the benefits, peaches that are subjected to long periods of cold storage can develop chilling injury symptoms  which reduce the postharvest quality of these fruits and results in significant economical losses  <cit> .

most of the efforts directed towards understanding the molecular basis of cold acclimation have been performed in the model plant a. thaliana  <cit> . little is known about what occurs under low, non-freezing temperatures in fruits or fruit trees. since chilling injury occurs in fruits that have undergone long-term cold storage, perhaps cold acclimation processes are associated with this injury. a better understanding of cold acclimation and cold-responsive genes in peach trees and fruits may provide clues about the association of cold acclimation and chilling injury.

several transcription factors associated with cold acclimation have been shown to regulate the expression of cold-inducible genes containing conserved abre  and/or dre  elements in their promoters  <cit> . the regulation of cold-inducible promoters in peaches may be mediated by the interaction between promoters containing these types of cis-elements and orthologous transcription factors. however, the identification and functional characterization of these types of promoters in fruit trees is lacking.

we have demonstrated previously that there is a conserved heterologous regulation of the wheat putative high-affinity pi transporter, tapt <dig> in both monocots  and dicots   <cit> . these findings demonstrate that arabidopsis may be used as a heterologous system to test the functionality of promoters. however, this type of heterologous regulation may not exist for all promoters and may not be conserved among all plant species. an alternative to functional analyses in heterologous systems is transient transformation of fruits using agro-infiltration. agro-infiltration of fruits have been performed to test the activity of the 35s camv promoter fused to reporter genes such as gus or luciferase in tomatoes, apples, pears, peaches, strawberries and oranges  <cit> . however, to our knowledge, it has not been used to determine the activity of cold-inducible promoters within the fruit .

to identify cold-responsive genes expressed in peach fruits, digital expression analyses of ests from fruits exposed to four different postharvest conditions were analyzed  <cit> . isolation of the promoter regions of three genes highly expressed in fruits that have undergone long-term cold storage, allowed us to identify common regulatory elements present in these promoters. functional characterization of these promoters  demonstrates that these are peach cold-inducible promoters and that there is a conserved heterologous regulation of these promoters in peach and arabidopsis.

methods
digital expression analyses
we have previously described the contigs used in this work  <cit> . the ests that make up these contigs represent transcripts from peach fruit mesocarp at four different postharvest conditions. the post-harvest conditions include: fruits processed in a packing plant ; packing followed by a shelf-life at 20°c for 2- <dig> days ; packing followed by cold storage at 4°c for  <dig> days  and packing followed by cold storage at 4°c for  <dig> days and shelf-life at 20°c for 2- <dig> days .

as we described in vizoso et al  <cit> , the contigs that represent differentially expressed genes were identified using the winflat program that submits the sequence data to a rigorous statistical analysis described by audic and claverie  <cit> . this analysis calculates the probability that a gene is equally expressed in two different conditions by observing the distribution of tag counts . therefore, small probability values  are associated with non-symmetrical distributions, characteristic of differentially expressed genes  <cit> .

to analyze the co-expression of differentially expressed genes, contigs were clustered using the pearson linear correlation coefficient  <cit> . briefly, contigs with at least five ests were selected to make the expression profile matrix, which consisted of  <dig>  rows  and  <dig> columns . the similarity between clusters and libraries was estimated using an un-centered pearson's correlation coefficient in the cluster  <dig>  program  <cit> . pearson correlation coefficients >  <dig>   are indicated by an asterisk in additional file  <dig>  dendrograms were constructed from the pair wise distances using the upgma algorithm. the results were visualized and analyzed using the java treeview program .

gene ontology molecular function and biological process annotations of the contigs are described in vizoso et al  <cit> . each annotation and contig assembly was manually corrected, when necessary.

mrna isolation and reverse transcriptase -pcr
the kit oligotex™ mrna spin-column  was used to purify mrna. the mrna was purified from pools of total rna obtained from peach fruit mesocarp  representing the stages e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> as described previously  <cit> . the mrna was quantified using the poly  mrna detection system™ . first strand cdna was synthesized from  <dig> ng of the mrna in a  <dig> μl final volume. the reaction mix was prepared using the improm-ii™ reverse transcription system  and anchored oligo  of 18-mers, according to the manufacturer's instructions. as an internal control for normalization, heterologous mrna  was added to each mrna sample. to control for genomic dna contamination, pcr amplification was performed on template rna that was not reverse transcribed. to confirm that the amplified fragments correspond to the cdnas of interest, these fragments were cloned in pbluescript and sequenced . the primer sequences used to amplify the internal regions of the basic endochitinase ppbec <dig> , dehydrin ppxero <dig> , thaumatin pptha <dig> , lipoxygenase pplox <dig>  and the actin ppact <dig>  genes are shown in table  <dig>  primers used to amplify a  <dig> bp fragment of the cdna from the kanamycin mrna control are: "upstream control primer"  and "downstream control primer" . pcr reactions were performed by diluting the cdnas a  <dig> fold and using  <dig> μl of each dilution as a template in a final reaction volume of  <dig> μl, containing  <dig>  μm primers;  <dig>  mm dntps;  <dig>  mm mgcl2; 5u taq polymerase and 1× buffer. the pcr conditions were: 93°c for  <dig> min and then a variable number of cycles  at 93°c for  <dig> sec,  <dig> min at 55°c, and  <dig> min at 72°c. the pcr reaction was with a final step at 72°c for  <dig> min.

cloning of the promoters
genomic dna was isolated from peach leaves  batch cv. o'henry) as described in manubens et al  <cit> . the universal genome walker™ kit  was used to isolate the promoters regions of ppbec <dig>  ppxero <dig>  pptha <dig> and pplox <dig>  the isolated genomic dna was digested with four restriction enzymes . dna fragments containing adaptors at both ends were used as a template for amplifying the promoter regions. gsp <dig> and gsp <dig> gene specific primers were designed to isolate the promoters . for the first group of pcr reactions, a specific adaptor primer  and the gsp <dig> primers specific for each gene were used. the final primer concentration in the pcr reaction was  <dig>  μm in a final volume of  <dig> μl. manual hot start was performed using  <dig> u of the synergy dna polymerase . the conditions for this first round of amplifications was:  <dig> cycle at 93°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles of 93°c for  <dig> sec, 72°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles of 93°c for  <dig> sec, 67°c for  <dig> min. for the nested pcr, the specific adaptor primer  <dig>  and the gene specific gsp <dig> primers were used. as a dna template in these reactions,  <dig> μl of a  <dig> fold dilution of end-product of the first round of amplifications was used. the conditions for the second round of amplification were:  <dig> cycle at 93°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles  of 93°c for  <dig> sec, 72°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles  of 93°c for  <dig> sec, 67°c for  <dig> min. the amplified products were cloned in pgem-t vector and sequenced . the ppbec <dig> and ppxero <dig> promoters were subsequently amplified from the pgem-t clones using the ap <dig> and bec-32bamhi or dx24bamhi primers, respectively . the products of this amplification were also cloned in the pgem-t vector and re-sequenced . the promoter fragments were extracted from the pgem-t vector , with a bamhi-sali sequential digestion, and transcriptionally fused to the uida reporter gene in the promoterless binary vector pbi <dig>   <cit> . the binary vector was introduced into a. tumefaciens  for subsequent arabidopsis and peach fruit transformations.

promoter sequences analysis
analysis of putative transcription factor binding sites was carried out using the database place  <cit>  coupled with visual analyses. to identify predicted conserved motifs, the promoter sequences were analyzed using the ymf  <dig>  program  <cit> . only the statistically significant motifs  were selected  <cit> .

growth, transformation and cold treatments of a. thaliana
wild-type and transgenic a. thaliana  were grown in a mixture of soil-vermiculite  in a growth chamber with a 16-h light cycle  at 22°c. alternatively, seeds were surface sterilized as described in gonzalez et al  <cit> , plated on murashige-skoog  media containing  <dig> % agar,  <dig> % sucrose and  <dig> mg/l kanamycin for transgenic lines and grown under the same conditions as the soil-grown plants.

transgenic arabidopsis was obtained by using the gv <dig> a. tumefaciens-mediated floral dip method  <cit> . a. tumefaciens previously transformed with the binary vector pbi <dig>  harboring the promoter::uida fusions: ppbec1::uida ; ppxero2::uida ; pptha1::uida , or the control vectors pbi <dig>  and pbi <dig>  , were used. in cold treatments, t <dig> homozygous transgenic arabidopsis seedlings were grown on plates containing 1× ms media,  <dig> % agar, and  <dig> % sucrose in a growth chamber with a 16-h light cycle  at 24°c for two weeks, and then transferred to 4°c for  <dig> days. a minimum of three independent transgenic lines were used for each construct.

peach fruit transient transformation and cold treatments
a. tumefaciens transformed with the vectors pbippbec <dig>  pbippxero <dig>  pbipptha <dig>  pbi <dig> or pbi <dig>  were grown in lb medium supplemented with kanamycin , rifampicin  and gentamycin . the cultures were grown for two days at 28°c until they reached an od <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig> . the culture was then centrifuged and the pellet re-suspended in mma medium ,  <dig> g/l sucrose, and  <dig> μm acetosyringone) to reach an od <dig> of  <dig> . approximately  <dig>  ml of this bacterial suspension was used to infiltrate mature fruits from o'henry, elegant lady and florida king varieties of peach as described by spolaore et al  <cit> .

to analyze the promoter activity at 20°c, the fruits infiltrated with the different constructs, were stored in a dark growth chamber for five days. to analyze the cold-responsive promoter activity, the infiltrated fruits were stored  <dig> days post-infiltration  in a dark growth chamber at 4°c for  <dig> days. after the growth chamber incubation time, the infiltrated region of the fruit was extracted with a cork bore and stained for gus activity as described by tittarelli et al  <cit> .

gus activity measurement
histochemical staining of arabidopsis seedlings for β-glucuronidase  activity was performed as described by jefferson et al  <cit> , with the following modifications: transgenic arabidopsis seedlings used in the cold-treatments described earlier were vacuum infiltrated in  <dig> mm nah2po <dig>  ph  <dig> ;  <dig>  mm x-gluc;  <dig> mm edta and  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  these samples were incubated in the dark at 37°c for 24- <dig> h. samples that did not develop color after  <dig> h were considered negative for gus activity. plant material was subsequently fixed in  <dig> % formaldehyde,  <dig> % acetic acid and  <dig> % ethanol for  <dig> min, followed by an ethanol dilution series to remove chlorophyll from the plant tissue .

slices  of transiently transformed peaches were imbibed in the gus staining solution 6;  <dig>  mm k4fe6; 1× triton x-100;  <dig>  mm edta; 20%  methanol and  <dig>  mm x-gluc)  <cit> . samples were vacuum-infiltrated for  <dig> min at room-temperature and then incubated overnight at 37°c. fluorometric gus assays were performed as described by jefferson et al  <cit> . the arabidopsis seedlings were ground in a mortar using liquid nitrogen, and the tissue powder was transferred to a microtube. one ml of the extraction buffer  sodium laurylsarcosine and  <dig> mm dithiothreitol) was added. samples were centrifuged for  <dig> min at  <dig>  g at 4°c and the supernatant was transferred to a new microtube. the fluorogenic reaction was carried out in  <dig> ml volume containing  <dig> mm 4-methyl umbelliferyl glucuronide  in an extraction buffer supplemented with a  <dig> μl aliquot of the protein extract supernatants. the protein quantity of the sample extracts was determined as described previously  <cit> , using bovine serum albumin  as a standard.

approximately 95% of the  <dig> cold-induced peach genes share significant identity with sequences in arabidopsis, suggesting that these may be putative orthologs. the putative arabidopsis orthologs that are induced or repressed by cold, based on coldarraydb analyses  are shown in table  <dig>  only  <dig> contigs  share significant sequence identity with genes of unknown function. approximately 38% of these contigs  share significant sequence identity with plant gene sequences annotated as expressed proteins. six of the contigs with unknown function do not share sequence identity with any sequences in the public databases, suggesting that these are novel genes.

annotation frequency comparative analyses of cold-induced , cold-repressed  or contigs unrelated to cold , revealed an overrepresentation of stress response genes and an underrepresentation of genes related to energy metabolism in fruits that were stored in the cold . among the genes related to stress response we identified four contigs that are similar to thaumatin-like proteins: c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> . three of the stress response genes are similar to chitinases: c <dig> ; c <dig>  and c <dig> . two of the stress response genes are similar to dehydrins: c <dig>  and c <dig>  100% amino acid identity with p. persica type ii sk <dig> dehydrin ppdhn <dig> .

cold-induced expression of ppbec <dig>  ppxero <dig> and pptha1
we evaluated the expression levels of three cold-induced candidate genes by rt-pcr: a basic endochitinase , a dehydrin  and a thaumatin-like protein . these genes were chosen due to the high number of ests in cold-stored fruits , as revealed by the digital expression analyses . the expression level of a contig similar to lipoxygenase  that does not express preferentially in cold stored fruits  as well as the expression level of a contig  that does not significantly change expression under the different post-harvest conditions, were analyzed . interestingly, all five genes analyzed showed an expression pattern significantly similar to the ones predicted by the digital expression analyses . the genes ppbec <dig>  ppxero <dig> and pptha <dig> have an increased expression in cold-stored fruits, whereas the pplox <dig> gene increased expression in woolly fruits rather than cold-stored fruits.

identification of conserved motifs in the promoters of cold-inducible genes ppbec <dig>  ppxero <dig> and pptha1
we cloned  <dig> bp,  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp fragments corresponding to the regions upstream of the translation start codons of ppbec <dig>  ppxero <dig> and pptha <dig>  respectively. the sequences of these promoter regions as well as the cdna of their corresponding genes are shown in the additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

the high sequence identity between the ppxero <dig> contig with the coding region of ppdhn <dig> <cit>  was also observed within the promoter sequences of these two genes. only one nucleotide difference at position - <dig> was found, suggesting that ppxero <dig> and ppdhn <dig> may be the same gene . however, the promoter isolated in this work is about  <dig> bp longer  than the previously published promoter  <cit> .

cis-element regulatory motifs related to cold gene expression regulation such as abre  <cit> , mycr  <cit> , mybr  <cit>  and dre/crt  <cit>  were identified in all three promoters of these cold-inducible genes . in addition, three statistically significant predicted motifs were present in the promoters of these cold-inducible genes . these motifs were not found in the pplox <dig> promoter identified in this work .

cold-induced ppbec <dig> and ppxero <dig> promoters in transiently transformed peach fruits and stably transformed arabidopsis
transient transformation assays of peach fruits revealed that all three cloned promoters  were able to activate gus  expression . however, only the pbippbec <dig> and pbipxero <dig> promoter constructs showed cold-inducible increases in gus activity . the pbiptha <dig> construct was expressed at both 20°c and 4°c. comparable results were seen in fruits from three different peach varieties .

similar results were seen when these promoter-gus constructs were analyzed in stably transformed arabidopsis. all three constructs were able to activate gus expression, but only the ppbec <dig> and ppxero <dig> promoters  induced expression in response to cold . as observed with the fruit transient transformation assays, the pptha <dig> promoter  expressed gus under all conditions analyzed.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
digital expression analyses of est datasets have permitted us to identify a large diversity of cold-inducible genes in peach fruits, three of which were chosen for further analyses . both digital expression analyses and rt-pcr suggest that the ppbec <dig>  ppxero <dig> and pptha <dig> are cold-inducible genes. the promoters of these cold-inducible genes were isolated and characterized using both transient transformation assays in peach fruits and stable transformation in arabidopsis. these analyses have revealed that the isolated ppbec <dig> and ppxero <dig> promoters are cold-inducible promoters, whereas the isolated pptha <dig> promoter was not cold-inducible. these results, therefore, demonstrate that the isolated ppbec <dig> and ppxero <dig> promoters are sufficient for cold-induced gene expression. furthermore, these results suggest that there is a conserved heterologous cold-inducible regulation of these promoters in peach and arabidopsis.

plants respond to cold temperatures by modifying the transcription and translation levels of hundreds of genes  <cit> . these acute molecular changes are related to plant cell physiological and biochemical modifications  that lead to stress tolerance and cold adaptation . in peach fruits, cold temperatures induce chilling injury, possibly due to global transcriptome changes  <cit> . with the exception of studies in the model organism a. thaliana  <cit>  and work published recently  <cit> , little is known about the peach global transcriptional response to cold. using the pearson correlation coefficient, we analyze the coordinated gene expression of  <dig>  contigs. this analysis revealed  <dig> genes preferentially expressed in peach fruits, of which digital expression analyses  <cit>  revealed  <dig> of these genes  with statistically significant cold-induction. a large proportion of the contigs preferentially expressed at 4°c  do not exhibited significant sequence homology  with the rest of the analyzed contigs . this result could suggest that these contigs represent genes with non-redundant functions that will have a special importance during the exposure of the fruits to low temperatures.

among the highly expressed genes in cold stored fruits, we found genes related to stress response in plants, including three dehydrins , three chitinases , four thaumatin-like proteins , and polygalacturonase inhibiting protein , similar to what was reported by ogundiwin et al  <cit> . dehydrins are hydrophilic proteins that belong to the subgroup d- <dig> of the lea  proteins  <cit> . there is some evidence that suggests that dehydrins protect macromolecules such as membranes and proteins against the damages associated with water deficiency  <cit> . in peach, these genes are induced during cold acclimation and in cold-stored fruits  <cit> . it has been observed that pathogenesis-related  proteins such as chitinases and thaumatins are accumulated in the apoplastic space in winter rye during cold acclimation. these proteins also may have antifreeze properties that will protect the integrity of the plant cell avoiding the formation of ice  <cit> . it has also been observed that these types of proteins retain their enzymatic activity under low temperatures, and may form part of a general response mechanism associated with unfavorable conditions, by providing protection from opportunist pathogen attack whilst the plant is in a weakened state  <cit> . a similar role is shared by polygalacturonase inhibiting proteins in different plants models  <cit> .

we also found some genes related to protein folding and degradation, such as heat shock proteins, bip- <dig> and dj- <dig> family proteins . these processes are very active when plants face low temperatures, chemical and oxidative stress. these proteins participate in the prevention and repair of damage produced by cold, through the stabilization of protein structure and the degradation of proteins that are not folded correctly  <cit> .

in this work we were interested in isolating and functionally characterizing promoters of cold-inducible peach genes. to date, only a few inducible promoters have been identified in crop plants. the pptha <dig>  ppbec <dig> and ppxero <dig> genes were chosen for promoter cloning and characterization based on the up-regulation that these genes showed in the in silico analysis and rt-pcr. the promoter sequences of these genes contain several cis-regulatory elements such as dre/crt, abre, mycr  and mybr   <cit>  that are related to stress response, specifically to cold/dehydration. these cis-regulatory elements are conserved in several plant species  <cit> . the presence of these conserved motifs suggests that these promoters may respond to the cold. using transient transformation in peach fruit we confirmed that the promoters isolated from ppbec <dig> and ppxero <dig> are induced during low temperature storage, but not at room temperature. on the other hand, the pptha <dig> promoter is active under all the temperatures analyzed. this could indicate that the pptha <dig> promoter sequence might not contain all the elements needed to regulate expression in a cold-inducible manner. alternatively, the agro-infiltration technique may induce stress signals that will activate this promoter. however, this last possibility is not likely because the activation of the pptha <dig> promoter at all analyzed temperatures is also seen in the stably transformed transgenic arabidopsis plants. the promoters ppbec <dig> and ppxero <dig>  however, are cold-induced both in arabidopsis transgenic plants as well as transient expressing fruits, suggesting that the ppbec <dig> and ppxero <dig> promoters are cold-inducible peach promoters. the cold-inducibility of these promoters in a. thaliana also suggests that this model plant may be used to functionally analyze peach cold-induced genes as well as their corresponding cis-elements and trans-acting factors.

the identification of these fruit tree cold-inducible promoters as well as the conserved heterologous regulation of these promoters in peach and arabidopsis, demonstrates that these two transformation assays may be used to molecularly define the cis-elements and trans-acting regulatory factors that are associated with cold-responsive genes. by better understanding the regulatory mechanisms associated with cold-responsive genes, we may better understand the molecular differences and similarities between cold acclimation and chilling injury as well as the role these processes play in fruit tree growth and fruit quality.
