BACKGROUND
legumes evolved the capacity to live in an intimate endosymbiosis with nitrogen-fixing rhizobium bacteria. to host rhizobia intracellularly, nodules are formed on the root of the plant. these nodules provide optimal physiological conditions to the bacteria to fix atmospheric nitrogen gas into ammonia. recent studies have suggested a role for strigolactones in rhizobium symbiosis . here we focus on expression of the strigolactone biosynthesis gene dwarf <dig> during the legume-rhizobium interaction.

nodule formation is initiated upon perception of lipo-chitooligosaccharide  signals excreted by compatible rhizobium bacteria  <cit> . these signals mitotically activate root cortical and pericycle cells, resulting in the formation of a nodule primordium  <cit> . rhizobium lcos  are also required to initiate an infection process to establish intracellular accommodation of the prokaryotic endosymbiont. this infection process starts in curled root hairs where a tube-like structure is formed intracellularly, which guides the rhizobia to the newly formed nodule primordium. there, the rhizobia are released as organelle-like structures , which remain surrounded by a plant-derived membrane. these symbiosomes act as nitrogen-fixing units that provide ammonia to the plant cell in exchange of nutrients  <cit> .

rhizobium lco signals are perceived by a specific set of lysm-type receptor kinases at the root epidermis. this activates a signaling cascade that is shared with a more ancient endosymbiosis; that between land plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi  <cit> . this signaling cascade consists of a plasma membrane localized lrr-type receptor kinase , a cation ion channel in the nuclear envelope , and a nuclear localized ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase  . downstream of this cascade, ccamk phosphorylates the transcriptional activator cyclops, which orchestrates symbiotic root nodule development in conjunction with other transcription factors  <cit> . among these are the gras-type transcriptional regulators nsp <dig> and nsp <dig> . experiments in heterologous systems have revealed that nsp <dig> can form a heterodimer with nsp <dig>  suggesting a regulatory link between both proteins  <cit> . both transcriptional regulators are essential for rhizobium symbiosis, but also promote mycorrhizal infection .

under non-symbiotic conditions, nsp <dig> and nsp <dig> regulate the expression of dwarf <dig> , which encodes a key enzyme in strigolactone biosynthesis  <cit> . strigolactones are a class of plant hormones derived from all-trans-β-carotene . they are produced mainly in the root of the plant and the biosynthesis of their basic structure involves at least three plastid-localized enzymes; the carotenoid isomerase d <dig> and the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases  <dig>  and ccd <dig>  <cit> . the subsequent activity of these three enzymes results in biosynthesis of carlactone, a precursor of strigolactones. the conversion of carlactone to strigolactones is not completely resolved yet, but there is strong evidence to support that this involves a cytochrome p <dig> enzyme, encoded by max <dig> in arabidopsis  and rice  . this biosynthetic pathway is under the control of a nutrient sensing mechanism and/or the nutrient status of the plant . especially in plants grown under phosphate-limited conditions, d <dig> expression and subsequent strigolactone production is markedly increased in an nsp1/nsp2-dependent manner  <cit> .

under phosphate limitation, strigolactones are exuded into the rhizosphere to attract arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi . these obligatory biotrophic  fungi can sense strigolactones and respond with an increased hyphal branching, thereby, promoting colonization of plant roots  <cit> . the endomycorrhizal symbiosis facilitates nutrient exchange between fungus and plant. mycelium that remains in the soil markedly increases the plant root capacity to access nutrients, especially immobile phosphates. the plant receives these nutrients from the fungi at the expense of carbohydrates  <cit> . although strigolactones are not essential for establishment of an endomycorrhizal symbiosis, they contribute significantly to increasing root infection levels  <cit> .

several reports suggest also a role for strigolactones in legume nodule formation. in medicago sativa and m. truncatula, application of  <dig>  μm gr <dig> was shown to promote nodule formation, whereas slightly higher concentrations inhibited nodule formation in m. truncatula  <cit> . in pea  and lotus japonicus, strigolactone deficient mutants were shown to produce less nodules, which could be rescued by external application of gr <dig> . furthermore, in m. truncatula root hairs mtd <dig> and mtccd <dig> expression is increased at 5 days post rhizobium inoculation  <cit> . this implies that mtd <dig> expression is regulated also in a symbiotic context. however, the precise regulatory network remains unknown.

here, we show that in m. truncatula mtd <dig> expression is induced by rhizobium lcos in an mtnsp <dig> and mtnsp2-dependent manner, similar as found for the induction of mtd <dig> by phosphate starvation. however, only induction of mtd <dig> by rhizobium lcos requires the symbiosis signaling cascade. using promoter-reporter constructs, we show that mtd <dig> is expressed throughout nodule formation. after early activation in the epidermis, its expression becomes restricted to the nodule primordium and subsequently to the nodule meristem and infection zone. furthermore, we show that in nodule primordia and mature nodules mtd <dig> is co-expressed with mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig> 

RESULTS
mtd <dig> is involved in strigolactone biosynthesis
the m. truncatula d <dig> ortholog  was identified previously  <cit> . by searching the m. truncatula genome annotation mt <dig> , we noted the presence of  <dig> close homologs of the original mtd <dig> gene. to get insight in the relation of these genes to mtd <dig>  we conducted a phylogenetic analysis based on an alignment of d <dig> proteins of different plant species, including rice and arabidopsis . this showed that these sequences grouped in three separate phylogenetic clades , consistent with a previous report  <cit> . interestingly, the d <dig> clade contains  <dig> proteins from m. truncatula: mtd <dig>  <cit>  as well as a close homolog medtr7g <dig>  this shows that m. truncatula contains  <dig> putative d <dig> genes that could function redundantly. expression of mtd <dig> and subsequent strigolactone production is known to be induced by phosphate starvation  <cit> . to get first insight whether medtr7g <dig> may also have a function in strigolactone production in m. truncatula roots, we examined its expression pattern. analysis of publically available microarray data showed that medtr7g <dig> expression is relatively low, and has limited overlap with expression of mtd <dig>  <cit> . in roots, medtr7g <dig> expression is not induced by phosphate starvation. this in contrast to mtd <dig>   <cit> . this suggests that under phosphate limiting conditions only mtd <dig> might be involved in strigolactone biosynthesis in m. truncatula roots.fig.  <dig> bayesian phylogeny of d <dig> and d27-like proteins. phylogeny was reconstructed based on an alignment of d <dig> and d27-like proteins from arabidopsis , soybean  , lotus japonicus , m. truncatula , rice , poplar   and grapevine  . branch support is indicated by posterior probabilities. terminals are labeled by their gene name or genbank identifier. proteins identified from m. truncatula are highlighted in bold. the d <dig> orthology group containing rice osd <dig>  and arabidopsis atd <dig>  is highlighted in blue. mid-point rooting was applied for better tree visualization



next, we determined whether mtd <dig> represents a functional enzyme in the strigolactone biosynthesis pathway. to this end, we generated m. truncatula compound plants bearing transgenic roots in which mtd <dig> expression was reduced through rnai-mediated knock-down. this reduced mtd <dig> expression by ~65 %, though with substantial variation . in contrast, expression of medtr7g <dig> was not reduced, but lower than mtd <dig> . measurements of root extracts as well as root exudates collected from the mtd <dig> rnai roots showed a 45-55 % reduction in strigolactone concentrations compared to that in the empty vector control . taken together, this shows that mtd <dig> is involved in strigolactone biosynthesis and represents a functional ortholog of osd <dig> from rice.fig.  <dig> effect of mtd <dig> knock-down on strigolactone biosynthesis. a relative transcript abundance as determined by qrt-pcr of mtd <dig> and medtr7g <dig> in m. truncatula transgenic roots expressing an empty vector control construct  or mtd <dig> rnai construct . relative transcript abundance was normalized against mtd <dig> transcript abundance in roots transformed with the empty vector control . b relative quantity of the strigolactone didehydro-orobanchol   in root exudates collected from m. truncatula transgenic roots expressing an empty vector control construct  or mtd <dig> rnai construct . c relative quantity of the strigolactone didehydro-orobanchol   in root extracts collected from m. truncatula transgenic roots expressing an empty vector control construct  or mtd <dig> rnai construct . data shown represent means of 4- <dig> biological replicates ± sem. different letters above bars indicate statistical difference 



expression of mtd <dig> is increased upon perception of rhizobium lcos in an mtnsp <dig> and mtnsp2-dependent manner
to obtain insight in the symbiotic function of mtd <dig>  we first determined whether its expression is responsive to rhizobium lcos. quantitative rt-pcr  reactions on rna isolated from m. truncatula roots treated with sinorhizobium meliloti lcos  for 3 h revealed that expression of mtd <dig> is strongly induced . to determine whether medtr7g <dig> is also responsive to rhizobium lcos, we quantified its expression as well. this showed that, unlike mtd <dig>  medtr7g <dig> is not responsive . the low expression of medtr7g <dig> in combination with its non-responsiveness to phosphate starvation and rhizobium lcos let us to decide to focus further studies on the symbiotic function of mtd <dig> fig.  <dig> relative transcript abundance of mtd <dig> and medtr7g <dig> after application of rhizobium lcos. relative transcript abundance as determined by qrt-pcr of mtd <dig> and medtr7g <dig> in m. truncatula root susceptible zones 3 h after mock  or s. meliloti lco   treatment. data shown represent means of  <dig> biological replicates that each were analyzed in 3-fold  ± sem. for each gene, transcript abundance was normalized against that of the mock-treated wild type. different letters above bars indicate statistical difference 



to acquire more insight in the symbiotic responsiveness of mtd <dig>  we conducted a time series qrt-pcr experiment. to this end, m. truncatula seedlings were grown in fåhraeus slides  <cit> , a system optimized to study early responses induced by rhizobium lcos in the root epidermis. m. truncatula roots of wild-type plants were treated with s. meliloti lcos  for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 3 h. subsequently, total rna was isolated from the so-called susceptible zone, a region of about 1 cm just above the root meristem. expression analysis by qrt-pcr showed a slight induction of mtd <dig> already at 1 h post lco application, and a strong >20-fold induction after 2-3 h compared to mock-treated roots . this timing and induction level is comparable to that of mtenod11; a gene frequently used as marker for rhizobium lco-induced signaling in m. truncatula  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> symbiotic mtd <dig> expression is under direct control of s. meliloti lco signaling. a relative transcript abundance as determined by qrt-pcr of mtd <dig> and mtenod <dig> in m. truncatula root susceptible zones after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 3 h of lco treatment . b relative transcript abundance as determined by qrt-pcr of mtd <dig> at 3 h after mock  or rhizobium lco   treatment in wild type, mtdmi <dig>  mtdmi <dig> and mtdmi <dig>  c relative transcript abundance as determined by qrt-pcr of mtd <dig> at 3 h after mock  or rhizobium lco   treatment in wild type, mtnsp <dig>  mtnsp <dig> and mtnsp <dig> mtnsp <dig>  d relative transcript abundance as determined by qrt-pcr of mtenod <dig> at 3 h after mock  or rhizobium lco   treatment in wild type and mtern <dig>  e relative transcript abundance as determined by qrt-pcr of mtd <dig> at 3 h after mock  or rhizobium lco   treatment in wild type and mtern <dig>  f relative transcript abundance as determined by qrt-pcr of mtd <dig> and mtenod <dig> after mock  or rhizobium lco   treatment, in presence or absence of 50 μm cycloheximide . data shown represent means of  <dig> biological replicates that each were analyzed in 3-fold  ± sem. for each gene, transcript abundance was normalized against that of the mock-treated wild type. different letters above bars indicate statistical difference 



induction of mtenod <dig> expression by rhizobium lcos requires a signaling module downstream of lco perception consisting of mtdmi <dig>  mtdmi <dig> and mtdmi3/mtccamk  and the transcriptional regulators mtnsp <dig>  mtnsp <dig> and mtern <dig> . to investigate whether induction of mtd <dig> expression by rhizobium lcos is also dependent on this signaling module, we conducted qrt-pcr on lco-susceptible root zones of these mutant plants, using mtenod <dig> as control. this revealed that mtd <dig> expression is not induced in mtdmi <dig>  mtdmi <dig> and mtdmi <dig> mutant roots , indicating that symbiotic induction of mtd <dig> requires the common signaling module genes. previously, we demonstrated that mtd <dig> expression in non-inoculated roots is dependent on mtnsp <dig> and mtnsp <dig>  <cit> . here, we found that mtd <dig> expression is still induced by lcos in an mtnsp <dig>  mtnsp <dig> and mtnsp1mtnsp <dig> mutant background, albeit significantly lower than in wild-type roots  . next, we monitored mtd <dig> expression in the mtern <dig> mutant, in which lco-induced mtenod <dig> expression is blocked  <cit>  . in this mutant, the induction of mtd <dig> by rhizobium lcos is about half of that in the wild type . taken together, these results show that mtd <dig> is a rhizobium lco-responsive gene whose expression in a symbiotic context is largely dependent on the common signaling module and the transcriptional regulators mtnsp <dig>  mtnsp <dig> and in part mtern <dig> 

previously it was shown in vicia sativa that the lco inducibility of early nodulin genes is indirect, as an inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide  blocks early nodulin genes expression  <cit> . as mtd <dig> displays a comparable expression pattern as mtenod <dig>  we tested whether this gene is a primary target of rhizobium lco signaling. to this end, m. truncatula seedlings were grown in fåhraeus slides for 3 days and pre-treated with 50 μm chx for 30 min prior to lco treatment . the expression of mtd <dig> and mtenod <dig> in the susceptible root zone was monitored by qrt-pcr. this showed that in control plants mtd <dig> expression is elevated by chx treatment , suggesting that active protein synthesis is required to keep mtd <dig> expression at basal levels. additionally it showed that, like mtenod <dig>  mtd <dig> expression is induced by rhizobium lcos in the absence of chx, but not in the presence of chx . this indicates that induction of mtd <dig> expression by rhizobium lcos requires new protein synthesis and therefore suggests that induction of mtd <dig> by rhizobium lcos is indirect.

mtd <dig> is co-expressed with mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig> during nodule formation
to obtain insight in the symbiotic function of mtd <dig>  its spatiotemporal expression pattern is analyzed. for this, a ~1 kb fragment representing the 5’ region upstream of the translational start site was cloned into a binary transformation vector in front of a β-glucuronidase  encoding sequence. this construct was used to create m. truncatula compound plants carrying transgenic roots. in non-inoculated plants, grown on buffered nodulation medium  containing no nitrate, but a relatively high phosphate concentration , mtd <dig> expression was observed in the vasculature and pericycle . lco  treatment for 3 h induced mtd <dig> expression in the root epidermis .fig.  <dig> spatial expression pattern of mtd <dig> in m. truncatula roots and nodules. the mtd <dig> spatial expression pattern was analyzed in m. truncatula transgenic roots expressing an mtd <dig> promoter-reporter gus construct. a cross-section through a non-inoculated root. arrowheads indicate casparian strips, which mark the endodermal cell layer. b mock-treated control root. c root treated with s. meliloti lcos  for 3 h. d root at four days post inoculation  with s. meliloti strain  <dig>  e root at  <dig> dpi. f longitudinal section through a root at  <dig> dpi. g longitudinal section through a nodule primordium . the infection thread is indicated with an arrowhead. h longitudinal section through an eighteen-day-old nodule. scale bars are equal to 25 μm ,  <dig>  mm  and 50 μm . sections were counterstained with ruthenium red



next, we determined the spatial expression of mtd <dig> following inoculation with s. meliloti strain  <dig>  this showed that at 4 days post inoculation , the pmtd27::gus transgenic roots showed a patched gus staining, which was associated with rhizobium root hair infections . at  <dig> dpi, the expression in the root ceased, but gus activity accumulated in nodule primordia . sectioning nodule primordia revealed expression of pmtd27::gus in dividing pericycle and cortical cells . this expression maintains in the developing nodule primordium , but becomes more restricted in the mature nodule, where it is visible only in the meristem and distal infection zone . taken together, the lco responsiveness and its spatial expression pattern in nodule primordia, nodule meristem and infection zone strongly support a symbiotic function of mtd <dig> 

as strigolactone biosynthesis requires at least three enzymes, we tested whether besides mtd <dig>  also ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> are responsive to rhizobium lcos in m. truncatula. to this end, we first identified the putative orthologs of ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> from the m. truncatula genome based on homology to arabidopsis genes. this revealed that one copy of ccd <dig>  and two copies of ccd <dig>  are encoded in the m. truncatula genome . medtr3g <dig> was described previously as mtccd <dig>  <cit> . analysis of the medicago gene atlas showed that mtccd <dig> and medtr7g <dig> show a similar expression pattern, though expression of mtccd <dig> is about 10- to 20-fold higher when compared to medtr7g <dig>  <cit> . this also applies to expression of both genes during phosphate starvation and rhizobium lco application , and therefore we decided to focus on mtccd <dig> for the remainder of this study. expression analysis by qrt-pcr on samples taken from plants grown in fåhraeus slides showed that mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig> were not induced at 3 h post rhizobium lco application . in contrast, in roots grown on agar-solidified fähraeus medium supplemented with aminoethoxyvinylglycine  expression of mtccd <dig> is induced ~5-fold 3 h after application of rhizobium lcos, whereas mtccd <dig> expression was not substantially affected .fig.  <dig> expression of mtd <dig>  mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig> upon treatment with rhizobium lcos. a relative transcript abundance as determined by qrt-pcr of mtd <dig>  mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig> in m. truncatula root susceptible zones 3 h after mock or rhizobium lco  treatment. rna was isolated from plants grown in fåhraeus slides. b relative transcript abundance as determined by qrt-pcr of mtd <dig>  mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig> in m. truncatula root susceptible zones  <dig> or 6 h after mock or rhizobium lco  treatment. rna was isolated from plants grown on agar-solidified fåhraeus medium supplemented with 1 μm avg. data shown represent means of 2- <dig> biological replicates that each were analyzed in 3-fold  ± sem. for each gene, transcript abundance was normalized against that of the mock-treated wild type. different letters above bars indicate statistical difference 



to determine the spatial-temporal expression pattern of mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig> promoter-reporter gus constructs were created and introduced in m. truncatula roots using a. rhizogenes-mediated transformation. we noted a basal expression pattern of both genes in the young root tip, including the susceptible zone and did not observe a discernible change in expression pattern of neither mtccd <dig> nor mtccd <dig> following lco treatment . this suggests that of the mtd27-mtccd7-mtccd <dig> biosynthesis module mtd <dig> expression is most strictly controlled in a spatial-temporal manner. however, upon inoculation with s. meliloti it showed that in young  nodule primordia mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig> are co-expressed with mtd <dig> . moreover, in mature nodules, mtd <dig>  mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig> are co-expressed in the nodule meristem and distal infection zone .fig.  <dig> spatial expression pattern of mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig> in m. truncatula nodule primordia and mature nodules. expression patterns were analyzed in m. truncatula transgenic roots expressing promoter-reporter gus constructs. a longitudinal section through a root expressing the pmtccd7::gus construct 2 days post inoculation  with s. meliloti strain  <dig>  b longitudinal section through a root expressing the pmtccd8::gus construct at  <dig> dpi. arrowhead points at an infection thread growing inside the root hair cell. c longitudinal section through a mature nodule expressing the pmtccd7::gus construct. d longitudinal section through a mature nodule expressing the pmtccd8::gus construct. scale bars are equal to 50 μm. sections were counterstained with ruthenium red



previous studies on strigolactone deficient mutants revealed that strigolactones at least in part contribute to root nodule formation and functioning . to test whether mtd <dig> function is required for rhizobium symbiosis, we determined the nodulation phenotype of mtd <dig> rnai roots. under these conditions, the mtd <dig> rnai construct reduced mtd <dig> expression by >90 % . examination of the mtd <dig> rnai roots showed that they can be effectively nodulated . sectioning ~ <dig> nodules did not reveal any discernible difference in nodule morphology between nodules formed on control or mtd <dig> rnai roots . this suggests that either the reduction in mtd <dig> expression is not sufficient to cause a phenotype or that mtd <dig> is not essential for root nodule development and functioning.

the induction of mtd <dig> expression by phosphate deprivation is independent of the common symbiotic signaling cascade
besides rhizobium lcos, also phosphate starvation elevates mtd <dig> expression in an nsp <dig> and nsp2-dependent manner  <cit> . induction of mtd <dig> by rhizobium lcos requires mtdmi3/mtccamk and in part mtern <dig>  dmi3/ccamk is positioned directly upstream of nsp1-nsp <dig> in the lco signaling pathway  <cit> , whereas ern <dig> functions in concert with nsp1-nsp <dig> to regulate expression of mtenod <dig>  <cit> . in line with this, we questioned whether mtdmi3/mtccamk and mtern <dig> are also required to induce mtd <dig> expression in response to a low phosphate status. first, we determined to what extent the spatial mtd <dig> expression in m. truncatula roots is affected by different phosphate regimes. to this end, transgenic m. truncatula plants carrying the mtd <dig> promoter-gus reporter construct were grown in perlite for 2 weeks at high phosphate , and subsequently transferred to no phosphate  medium. plant roots were stained histochemically for gus activity 5 days after the transfer and compared to control roots. in all plants, gus staining could be observed in the stele of the roots, as well as in the root apical meristems . phosphate-starved roots displayed a much more intense staining than control roots, which was most clear in the root apical meristem . however, unlike treatment with rhizobium lcos, phosphate starvation did not change the spatial expression pattern of mtd <dig> fig.  <dig> spatial expression pattern of mtd <dig> upon phosphate starvation. a transgenic m. truncatula root expressing pmtd27::gus grown in full nutrient condition . b longitudinal section of the root shown in . c expression of pmtd27::gus in m. truncatula transgenic roots after 5 days of phosphate starvation . d longitudinal section of the root shown in . e relative transcript abundance as determined by qrt-pcr of mtd <dig> in wild type  and the mtdmi <dig> mutant and mtnsp <dig> mtnsp <dig> double mutant after 2 days of phosphate starvation . f relative transcript abundance as determined by qrt-pcr of mtd <dig> in wt and the mtern <dig> mutant and mtnsp <dig> mtnsp <dig> double mutant after 2 days of phosphate starvation. scale bars are equal to 250 μm in  and  and 50 μm in  and . sections were counterstained with ruthenium red. data in  represent means of  <dig> biological replicates that each were analyzed in 3-fold  ± sem. for each gene, transcript abundance was normalized against that of the mock-treated wild type. different letters above bars indicate statistical difference 



next, we determined whether mtdmi3/mtccamk and mtern <dig> are also essential to mediate mtd <dig> expression by phosphate starvation. to this end, m. truncatula mtdmi <dig> and mtern <dig> knockout mutants were grown in an aeroponic system containing medium with high phosphate  and subsequently transferred to the medium containing no phosphate for 2 days. to determine the expression of mtd <dig>  qrt-pcr was conducted on rna isolated from the bottom 2-3 cm of the root. this study reveals that in both mutants induction of mtd <dig> in response to phosphate deprivation is similar to the induction found in roots of wild-type plants . this indicates that the phosphate response of mtd <dig> expression is independent of the symbiotic signaling genes mtdmi3/mtccamk and mtern <dig> 

discussion
several lines of evidence indicate that strigolactones play a role in the legume rhizobium symbiosis . here, we showed that expression of mtd <dig>  a gene that is acting in the strigolactone biosynthesis pathway, is strongly elevated by rhizobium lco-induced signaling. additionally, we found that this gene is co-expressed with mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig> in nodule primordia as well as in the infection zone of mature nodules. this suggests a putative function for these strigolactone biosynthesis genes during several stages of the legume-rhizobium interaction.

studies with the strigolactone analog gr <dig> revealed a nodulation enhancing effect when applied exogenously  <cit> . in line with this, a severe reduction in endogenous strigolactone levels due to mutations in ccd <dig> or ccd <dig> is linked to a moderate decrease in nodulation efficiency . foo and davies  <cit>  conclude that, although strigolactones influence nodule initiation they are not essential. we were unable to confirm these results in mtd <dig> rnai knockdown roots of m. truncatula. we cannot rule out that in our mtd <dig> rnai experiments mtd <dig> expression is not sufficiently reduced to cause such moderate nodulation phenotype. alternatively, phenotypes caused by an altered d <dig> function may be weaker to that of phenotypes of ccd <dig> or ccd <dig> mutants. this hypothesis finds support by studies in arabidopsis and rice, where shoot branching phenotypes were much more severe in ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> mutants when compared to d <dig>  <cit> . based on this, waters et al.  <cit>  speculate on residual bioactive compounds present in atd <dig> mutants. if such a residual bioactive compound also exists in m. truncatula, it is possible that its activity is sufficient for proper nodule initiation and development.

it remains currently unknown how strigolactones promote nodule initiation. one possible mechanism is through promoting the formation of a nodular auxin maximum. mathematical modelling predicts that such maximum is most likely created through a local reduction in the auxin transport capacity in the root cortex  <cit> . such reductions in root auxin transport capacity have been observed following rhizobial inoculation  <cit> . strigolactone-deficient mutants of arabidopsis show elevated auxin transport in both shoots and roots  <cit> . it is proposed that strigolactones act by targeting the pin auxin-efflux carriers at both the gene expression and protein level . therefore, it is possible that rhizobium-induced strigolactone biosynthesis will affect auxin transport and as such contributes to create and/or maintain an auxin maximum during nodule formation. however, it is unlikely that strigolactones alone are sufficient to reduce the auxin transport capacity upon perception of rhizobium lcos, as strigolactone-deficient mutants still form nodules, although less numerous than wild-type plants  <cit> . possibly, they could function redundantly to another signal, like for example cytokinin  or flavonoids  <cit> .

mtd <dig> expression is elevated within 1-2 h post lco application, by which it is among the earliest responsive genes. this transcriptional activation is under control of the rhizobium lco signaling network, which includes mtdmi <dig>  mtdmi <dig>  mtdmi3/mtccamk, mtnsp <dig>  mtnsp <dig> and in part mtern <dig>  we found that also expression of mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig> was induced following application of rhizobium lcos. however, these responses were less pronounced when compared to mtd <dig>  expression of mtccd <dig> was only slightly affected by application of rhizobium lcos, whereas induction of mtccd <dig> was dependent on the growth system. spatial-temporal expression analysis revealed that in a symbiotic context especially mtd <dig> expression is strictly controlled in a spatial-temporal manner. under non-symbiotic conditions mtd <dig> is mainly expressed in the stele of the root, whereas rhizobium lcos activate expression in the root epidermis. such clear spatial-temporal regulation was not observed for mtccd <dig> nor mtccd <dig> as both genes have a much broader expression pattern under non-symbiotic conditions. why mtd <dig> is strictly controlled under symbiotic conditions remains unknown. expression of mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig> might not be rate limiting, or alternatively, induction of mtd <dig> by rhizobium lcos might be part of a priming response that prepares epidermal cells for the infection process  <cit> .

our data hint at a putative role for strigolactones in mature nodules, as mtd <dig>  mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig> are co-expressed in the nodule meristem and distal infection zone. this may suggest that strigolactones promote meristem functioning and/or rhizobial infection. recently, it was shown that mtd <dig> and mtccd <dig> are transcriptionally induced in infected root hairs  <cit> . our data also indicate expression of mtd <dig> and mtccd <dig> in cells that contain growing infection threads in the root nodule, supporting a putative function for mtd <dig> and mtccd <dig> in the infection process. furthermore, induction of mtd <dig> expression by rhizobium lcos is partly dependent on mtern <dig>  a transcription factor required for infection thread development  <cit> .

mtd <dig> is also transcriptionally activated by phosphate starvation stress and this induction is dependent on mtnsp <dig> and mtnsp <dig>  <cit> . we studied the spatial regulation of mtd <dig> in response to phosphate starvation and found that the spatial expression pattern remains unchanged, but mtd <dig> expression is increased in the stele and apical root meristem. the transcriptional activation of mtd <dig> in response to the phosphate status in the environment coincides with an increased exudation of strigolactones  <cit> . generally, it is anticipated that this response is contributing to the attraction of endomycorrhizal fungi, which enhance phosphate acquisition from the environment  <cit> . we tested whether the induction of mtd <dig> by phosphate starvation is dependent on the common signaling pathway as well as whether this response is  dependent on mtern <dig>  neither signaling components were involved in the phosphate starvation induced mtd <dig> expression. this indicates that the signaling pathways regulating transcriptional activation of mtd <dig> by rhizobium lcos and phosphate starvation only share nsp <dig> and nsp <dig> . interestingly, mtd <dig> transcript abundance is reduced in an mtnsp1mtnsp <dig> mutant background when compared to wild type  <cit> . furthermore, we found that induction of this gene upon phosphate stress or lco signaling still occurs in these mutants, although at very moderate levels . taken together, this supports the hypothesis that mtnsp <dig> and mtnsp <dig> function in a parallel pathway to facilitate induction of mtd <dig> by rhizobium lcos and phosphate starvation stress, rather than being part of the primary signaling cascades  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> schematic model depicting the induction of mtd <dig> expression by phosphate starvation and rhizobium lco-induced signaling. rhizobium lcos activate expression of mtd <dig> through the common symbiosis signaling module consisting of mtdmi <dig>  mtdmi <dig> and mtdmi <dig>  downstream of this module mtern <dig> is required for full induction of mtd <dig>  mtern <dig> function is partly redundant, suggesting that mtern <dig> might function in conjunction with or redundant to another unknown transcriptional regulator, indicated as x. this unknown factor might be mtern <dig>  a transcriptional regulator closely related to mtern <dig>  <cit> . the pathway leading to activation of mtd <dig> expression by phosphate starvation remains unknown. the gras proteins mtnsp <dig> and mtnsp <dig> are required for expression of mtd <dig> during both phosphate starvation and following rhizobium lco application. we propose that these proteins function in parallel to both signaling pathways, as previously already suggested for the lco signaling cascade  <cit> 



the d27-ccd7-ccd <dig> biosynthetic module is largely conserved in higher plants. as we showed that mtd <dig> is transcriptionally activated in a spatial-temporal manner in response to rhizobium lcos in m. truncatula roots, this gene may represent an excellent marker gene to study rhizobium-induced signaling in a phylogenetic context.

CONCLUSIONS
here we showed that in m. truncatula, mtd <dig> expression is rapidly increased upon perception of rhizobium lcos. the gene remains expressed in the dividing cells of the nodule primordium and at subsequent stages its expression becomes confined to the nodule meristem and distal infection zone of the mature nodule. analysis of the expression of mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig> showed that they are co-expressed with mtd <dig> in nodule primordia and mature nodules. additionally, we show that symbiotic expression of mtd <dig> as well as its expression during phosphate starvation is dependent on the gras-type regulators mtnsp <dig> and mtnsp <dig>  this suggests that the nsp1-nsp2-d <dig> regulatory unit is co-opted to function in rhizobium symbiosis.
