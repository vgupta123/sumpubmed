BACKGROUND
pancreatic insulin-producing beta-cells are selectively destroyed by the immune system in type  <dig> diabetes mellitus . the autoimmune assault causes beta-cell dysfunction and death via direct contact with activated immune cells, such as macrophages and lymphocytes, and/or by exposure to soluble mediators secreted by these cells, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxygen free radicals and nitric oxide . the cytokines interleukin -1β, interferon -γ and tumor necrosis factor -α induce beta-cell death mainly by apoptosis in rodent and human islets of langerhans  <cit> . beta-cell apoptosis is a complex and highly regulated process that depends on the expression of a large number of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes  <cit> .

using microarray analyses, we have identified diverse beta-cell gene networks regulated by il-1β and ifn-γ  <cit> . cytokines induce stress response genes that are either protective or deleterious for beta-cell survival, whereas genes related to differentiated beta-cell functions are down-regulated. several of the cytokine effects in beta-cells depend on the activation of the transcription factor  nuclear factor -κb  <cit> . nf-κb is a homo- or hetero-dimeric complex of proteins from the rel/nf-κb family, which includes p <dig>  c-rel, relb, p50/p <dig> and p52/p <dig>  in non-simulated cells nf-κb is located in the cytoplasm as an inactive protein associated with the inhibitor of nf-κb α. when cells are simulated by agonists such as cytokines, bacterial products or viruses, iκbα is phosphorylated on serines  <dig> and  <dig> by an iκb kinase complex and degraded in the proteasome. this allows nf-κb to translocate to the nucleus where it binds to a set of related dna target sites  and regulates gene expression  <cit> .

depending on the cell type and stimulatory cue nf-κb can exert anti- or pro-apoptotic functions  <cit> . inhibition of cytokine-induced nf-κb activation protects pancreatic beta-cells in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit>  against apoptosis, suggesting that nf-κb is mostly pro-apoptotic in beta-cells. to identify cytokine-regulated and nf-κb-dependent beta-cell gene networks, we performed a microarray analysis in cytokine-treated rat beta-cells in which nf-κb activation was blocked by an nf-κb super-repressor 2). by this approach,  <dig> cytokine-modified and nf-κb regulated genes were identified, including genes coding for cytokines and chemokines and several tfs such as c-myc, c/ebpβ and c/ebpδ  <cit> . nf-κb was also found to control, via induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase  and no production, the expression of other tfs such as growth arrest and dna damage  <dig> and pancreatic duodenal homeobox - <dig>  this study was, however, limited to a single time point , and was based on an array with capacity to detect only ~ <dig>  probes; thus it did not allow a broad detection of the different genes regulated by nf-κb in beta-cells.

detailed knowledge of the patterns of gene expression involved in beta-cell death, together with a better understanding on their regulation, is crucial to understand and prevent beta-cell loss in t1dm. microarray technology allows robust massive gene expression, and we have employed this tool with success for the initial studies on beta-cell gene networks  <cit> . discovering gene networks, however, requires frequent usage of microarrays at different time points, with and without blockers of specific transcription factors. this demands large amounts of cells, posing a major problem when dealing with rare cells such as primary beta-cells. moreover, since there is cross talk between different networks, blocking transcription factors is seldom specific. validation of molecular regulation of beta-cell gene expression has been done by molecular biology techniques such as gel shift assay, transient transfection assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. these techniques are time consuming  and only allow the study of transcriptional regulation of one gene at a time  <cit> . clearly, novel approaches are required to elucidate the nature of large regulatory systems organized as networks  <cit> .

to obtain comprehensive information on the nf-κb-regulated gene networks in beta-cells, we presently utilized a bioinformatics approach  <cit>  to predict potential nf-κb-responsive genes. an increasing number of studies have used in silico analysis of regulatory sequences to assist the laboratory-based approaches in the search of tf targets  <cit> . some dna sequence-based approaches used to decipher regulatory networks relies on the prior knowledge of transcription factor binding site  preferences )  <cit> , whereas others discover new binding sites without prior consideration of the identity of the binding factor  <cit> .

predicting tfbss in gene promoter regions using pssms is limited by the high number of false matches due to the low information content of the often short and degenerate tfbss  <cit> . consequently, it is necessary to use additional information on gene regulation to improve the correlation between in silico predictions and in vivo functional binding sites. tfs are often part of cis-regulatory modules   <cit> , and the presence of multiple binding sites for a particular tf in the upstream region of a gene increases the likelihood that the tf truly binds the gene  <cit> . moreover, regulatory sequences are often preserved through evolution by selective pressure  <cit> . thus, conserved tfbss between different species are more likely to be functional. against this background, we incorporated these three biological properties of gene regulation to increase the accuracy of our predictions using discriminant analysis.

discriminant analysis is a powerful statistical pattern recognition method widely applied for data analysis in biomedical research  <cit> . it has been successfully utilized to identify yeast genes involved in methionine and phosphate metabolism on the basis of upstream regulatory motifs  <cit> . discriminant analysis uses a training set to learn how to recognize targets for a given tf based on putative regulatory elements present in their promoter regions. we presently utilized this classification method for the first time in a mammalian system to identify new genes potentially regulated by nf-κb in pancreatic beta-cells. for this purpose, the initial analysis searched a set of  <dig> known nf-κb target genes  for tfbss over-representation using tfm-explorer tool  <cit> . the top matching scores of the most significant over-represented pssms in this positive control set were then used to describe the  <dig> kb upstream sequences from the transcription start site  of both positive and negative examples of nf-κb regulation . this dataset was then used to train and test two alternative methods for discrimination of nf-κb target genes, namely linear and quadratic discriminant analysis . following these preliminary steps, a large group of human and rat beta-cell genes, detected in our previous array analysis  <cit>  was then searched for potential nf-κb target genes. to further increase the reliability of the predictions, we performed a conservation-based filter taking into account the number of homologous upstream regions that are predicted as nf-κb targets in other genomes, namely rat, mouse, human and chimpanzee. validation of the in silico analysis was achieved by comparison with our previous microarray gene expression data obtained from beta-cells exposed to different nf-κb-dependent stimuli.

RESULTS
over-represented tfbss in the upstream sequences of nf-κb regulated genes
pssms are commonly used to model and then to search putative tfbss in new sequences  <cit> . the tfm-explorer program  <cit>  detects locally over-represented tfbss, modeled by pssms, in a set of coexpressed or coregulated genes. the program first localizes all potential tfbss for a database of pssms, identifies regions where a given pssm is over-represented and then assesses their statistical significance. we used tfm-explorer with all available vertebrate pssms of the transfac database  <cit>   to search for pssms with a local over-representation in a set of  <dig> upstream sequences of known nf-κb target genes, as compared to two sets of  <dig> genes randomly picked from the human or mouse genomes . as expected, five of the most significant matrices  correspond to the main members of the rel/nf-κb family, whereas the last one  corresponds to c/ebp-β, which is one of the isoforms of the c/ebp transcription factor.

factor: name of the tf; matrix id: the transfac database identifier of the pssm; p-value: statistical significance of the over-representation of the factor when compared to a background distribution of predicted binding sites in arbitrary human or mouse promoters .

these over-represented matrices were used to scan and characterise the upstream sequences of beta-cell expressed genes by the patser program . since the presence of multiple high matrix-scores for a given tf in the upstream region of a gene increases probability of binding, each tfbs was represented by its five top matching scores. subsequently, each gene upstream sequence was characterized by a 30-element matrix matching score vector. note that the matrices used for scanning the sequences are partly redundant, since several of them represent the binding specificity of nf-κb. this type of redundancy is however efficiently treated by discriminant analysis.

performance of discriminant analysis
a stratified five-fold cross-validation procedure was performed to estimate the predictive performance of both lda and qda. for this purpose, the calibration dataset was first divided into five subsets of equal size . each subset was used once for testing the accuracy of the discriminant analysis trained on the four other subsets. lda and qda were then applied to each training set using the iterative procedure described in methods. at each round of the iterative procedure the performance metrics, namely sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value  of the classifier on the calibration dataset, were represented in figure  <dig> as the average of their observed values in each test set. for both methods the specificity and ppv showed a trend for increase after each round of the iterative procedure while there was a minor decrease in sensitivity, but the lda performed slightly better than qda. the best results, in terms of specificity and ppv, were obtained at the 6th round of the iterative procedure for lda  with an average rate of instances removed from the calibration dataset at around  <dig> % . for qda  three rounds of the iterative procedure  were sufficient to reach the best performance statistics . since the objective of this study was to predict an experimentally verifiable set of putative nf-κb regulated genes, we selected specificity and ppv as the main criterions of classification. against this background, the performance level obtained with lda was considered acceptable, and this method was selected for prediction of regulatory targets of nf-κb in all beta-cell-expressed genes .

prediction of nf-κb target genes in beta-cells
the whole calibration dataset  was used to construct a linear classifier for the prediction of nf-κb target genes in beta-cells. an iterative lda procedure was performed using the original dataset. at the 6th round the resulting pre-processed dataset and the selected variables by the stepwise procedure  were retrieved to construct the final lda classifier. the iterative procedure reduced the number of elements in the original dataset by removing the noisy patterns and returned a pre-processed dataset of  <dig> nf-κb target genes  and  <dig> nf-κb non-target genes . in figure  <dig>  the top matching scores obtained from the upstream sequences of this pre-processed dataset were plotted for both three different matrices  and an individual matrix , allowing visualisation in a three-dimensional space. nf-κb-regulated genes had generally higher scores than the non-regulated ones. the matrix scores-based separation between the two sets of genes was considered acceptable, but there was still a small overlap between the two groups of genes . the lda classifier trained on this filtered dataset was then used to analyze the genes expressed either in rat primary beta-cells   <cit> , insulin producing ins-1e cells   <cit>  or in human islets   <cit> , where we predicted respectively  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nf-κb candidate target genes ,  <dig>  and  <dig> ).

phylogeny-based filtering of predicted nf-κb target genes
groups of genes subject to a specific regulation are assumed to be evolutionary stable. we thus increased confidence in our predictions by filtering putative nf-κb target genes with phylogenetic conservation between two organisms, namely a rodent and a primate. for this purpose the lda classifier was used to analyse simultaneously the rat, mouse, human and chimpanzee homologous upstream regions of beta-cell-expressed genes. the nf-κb target genes predicted among the genes expressed in primary rat beta-cells and in human pancreatic islets were then compared with those predicted among their respective homologous from other species. the overlaps between the sets of predicted nf-κb target genes in different species were highly significant in all paired comparisons . as expected, the significance of these overlaps were more pronounced between closely related species . the genes which were predicted as nf-κb targets in at least a rodent and a primate species, for which the evolutionary distances are moderate , represent 29% , 31%  and 19%  of the total number of predicted nf-κb target genes in primary rat beta-cells, ins-1e cells and human pancreatic islets, respectively ,  <dig>  and  <dig> ).

targets in 1: number of nf-κb targets in species 1; targets in 2: number of nf-κb targets in species 2; overlap: number of nf-κb targets in common between species  <dig> and 2; total # of genes: number of analyzed pairs of homologous genes; p-value: probability to observe at least the obtained common number of nf-κb targets .

comparison of in silico analysis against microarray data
to further assess the validity of the in silico target predictions, the results described above were compared with those of previous microarray studies from our group . the microarray datasets describe the transcriptional response of beta-cells to putative nf-κb-dependent stimuli such as cytokines  <cit> , cytokines in the presence of an nf-κb blocker  <cit>  or an inos blocker  <cit>  and double stranded rna   <cit> .

when comparing the present in silico findings against mrnas that are up- or down-regulated by  <dig> or  <dig> h exposure of primary purified rat beta-cells to il-1β and/or ifn-γ  <cit> , we found that  <dig> of  <dig> cytokine -simulated genes  and  <dig> of  <dig> il-1β-regulated genes  were predicted as nf-κb target genes in rat beta-cells . in both cases there was a nearly 2-fold enrichment for putative nf-κb target genes as compared to non-cytokine regulated genes . we also checked the enrichment of predicted nf-κb target genes in a list of  <dig> dsrna-simulated genes  <cit> .  <dig> of the genes in this list   and only  <dig> of  <dig> non-dsrna-induced genes  were predicted as nf-κb target genes, with a 3-fold enrichment .

a combination of nf-κb blocking with microarray analysis  <cit> , has identified  <dig> cytokine-induced and nf-κb-regulated  genes in primary rat beta-cells. of note, this study used only one late time point, namely  <dig> h.  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were present in the set of beta-cell-expressed genes. to render the comparison more reliable, no-regulated genes were removed from this list. it has been shown by a time course microarray analysis  <cit>  that cytokines induce a late no production which indirectly modifies the expression of nearly 50% of the cytokine-affected mrnas after  <dig> h. among the  <dig> nf-κb-regulated genes,  <dig> are no-independent   <cit>  and  <dig> of these cytokine induced, nf-κb-regulated and no-independent genes  were predicted as putative nf-κb target genes by the lda classifier .

functional classes and temporal gene expression clusters enriched in predicted nf-κb target genes
tfs often regulate groups of genes with similar expression profiles and/or related function  <cit> . to test if this was the case in putative nf-κb-dependent genes,  <dig> no-independent genes were retrieved from nearly  <dig> cytokine-regulated genes. these genes were previously classified into  <dig> different groups according to their putative function and  <dig> clusters according to their temporal expression profile  <cit> . these datasets were tested for significant differences in the distribution of the functional classes between predicted nf-κb target and non-target genes . there were  <dig> nf-κb target genes and  <dig> nf-κb independent genes among the  <dig> no-independent and cytokine-regulated genes. the nf-κb-dependent genes are listed in table  <dig>  the most significantly over-represented functional classes in the set of predicted nf-κb target genes were cytokines and chemokines, major histocompatibility complex -related genes and adhesion molecules. concerning the temporal clusters, "cluster 1"  was the only one with a significant over-representation in the group of nf-κb target genes. this cluster is characterized by an early peak of gene expression at  <dig> h, followed by a decrease to below control levels at  <dig> h, and then a return to basal expression at  <dig> h. 38% of the genes in this cluster are related to signal transduction,  <dig> % are transcriptions factors and only 26% are no-dependent.

the classifications involved  <dig> no-independent and cytokine-regulated genes in ins-1e cells  <cit> .  <dig> of them were predicted as nf-κb targets by the present approach. p-value: statistical significance of the overlap between the genes belonging to the functional or temporal class and the set of predicted nf-κb target genes .

prob.: posterior probability for nf-κb regulation.

the nf-κb candidate target genes were also searched for statistical associations with the annotations from gene ontology . relevant go biological processes were extracted from the three sets of nf-κb candidate target genes in rat primary beta-cells , insulin producing ins-1e cells  or in human pancreatic islets . the go analysis ,  <dig>  and  <dig> ) indicated significant over-representation of biological processes such as "immune response", "antigen presentation and processing", "response to biotic stimulus" and "defense response".

discussion
identification of tf target genes by computational approaches poses more difficulties in higher eukaryotes than in organisms with smaller genomes such as yeast. scanning of large mammalian genomes for pssms matches is done in an enormous sequence space, as compared to the short size of dna motifs recognized by tfs  <cit> . this leads to a poor accuracy in tf target prediction, since only a small fraction of the predicted binding sites will have a functional role  <cit> . to reduce false predictions, the present study was restricted to the  <dig> kb upstream of the tss for each gene. in line with other studies  <cit> , we have previously observed that most pssm-predicted nf-κb binding sites are located within  <dig> kb upstream the tss  <cit> . this restriction, however, may decrease sensitivity and contribute for the fact that some known target genes escaped detection.

pssm-based approaches for tfbss prediction often relay on broad and sometimes inaccurate assumptions, and do not take in consideration putative combinatorial interactions between tfs that recognize multiple sites  <cit> . to incorporate such biological annotation to the prediction of nf-κb target genes, we first searched for common regulatory elements in the upstream sequences of a set of known nf-κb target genes. in addition to the pssms of the different members of the rel/nf-κb family, one pssm corresponding to c/ebp was also over-represented in the set of positive controls . nf-κb and c/ebp are known to interact, and their binding sites combine and form regulatory modules for several genes  <cit> . moreover, matrix-based methods have been already used to predict genes with composite nf-κb:c/ebp regulatory sites  <cit> . to account for the frequent presence of multiple binding sites for the same tf in a given regulatory region, we detected multiple hits from each locally over-represented pssm to characterize individual upstream sequences, and used them as input to train the classifier.

alignment-based phylogenetic footprinting methods are widely used to improve the specificity of tf target genes prediction  <cit> . these methods, however, rely on the assumption that the regulatory regions are sufficiently conserved to be aligned. instead of searching for putative tfbs that are situated in conserved regions in alignment between orthologous sequences, we used our classifier to screen each gene in parallel with a set of its homologs in other species: a given gene was considered as an nf-κb target only if its homologs were also classified as nf-κb regulated genes. this improved the accuracy of our predictions , but lead to an 70–80% decrease in the number of hits. in other words, although this approach apparently decreases false positives, it leads to a large increase in false negatives. thus, manganese superoxide dismutase  and c-myc, known nf-κb dependent genes  <cit> , were lost following this step.

the validation of computational methods is crucial to assess the significance of bioinformatics predictions. one of the possible ways for validation is the use of global gene expression intersection  <cit> . thus, we utilized microarray datasets from our group reporting the transcriptional response of beta-cells to different putative nf-κb-dependent stimuli  <cit> . by comparing them to our in silico predictions we observed that, in general, genes regulated by putative nf-κb-dependent stimuli had a 2–3-fold higher probability to be predicted as nf-κb targets than non-responsive genes . considering that these microarray experiments included few time points and a limited set of genes, and that gene expression can also be regulated by variables such as chromatin configuration, which is not detected by in silico approaches, the 20–30% agreement between our predictions and actual gene expression data is reasonable. functional classes such as cytokines and chemokines, mhc-related genes and adhesion molecules , whose expression is known to be regulated by nf-κb in other tissues  <cit> , were significantly enriched in a set of  <dig> manually annotated genes predicted as nf-κb targets. in agreement with these observations, go analysis indicated that categories such as "immune response" and "antigen presentation and processing" are over-represented in putative nf-κb-dependent genes. in addition, the temporal expression profile described by the enriched temporal "cluster 1"  is consistent with nf-κb regulation.

the predictions obtained from the present analysis represent manageable gene lists for further experimental validation, and provide an integrated platform for deciphering the nf-κb dependent gene networks in beta-cells. several genes in these lists are already described as nf-κb dependent in beta-cells and/or in other tissues, suggesting that the discrimination procedure generated reliable results. for instance, the cytokine-induced gene inos, for which the role of nf-κb was already confirmed in beta-cells  <cit> , was predicted with the highest posterior probability in primary rat beta-cells . among the genes already described as nf-κb targets in other tissues, we predicted with high probability some cytokines and chemokines such as the macrophage inflammatory protein  <dig>   <cit>  and the small inducible cytokines b <dig>   <cit> . most of the remaining genes, however, are novel potential nf-κb targets, and those among them which are predicted with the highest probabilities in different organisms can be interesting candidates for detailed experimental analysis.

known nf-κb target genes are in bold; prob.: posterior probability for nf-κb regulation; nf-κb: the homolog gene is predicted as an nf-κb target; ctl: the homolog gene is predicted as a non nf-κb target; na: upstream sequence of the homolog gene not available.

improvement of in silico analysis may be achieved by a more efficient integration of other types of genomic data. for instance by adding gene expression profiles to the matrix score vectors describing the upstream sequences, we can provide an important discriminative criterion to the classifier. expression profiles of genes regulated by the same tf are often highly correlated  <cit> , and addition of this information to the classifier may improve prediction specificity.

CONCLUSIONS
the sequencing of the human, rat and mouse genomes  <cit>  allows the development of new approaches to determine global cellular regulatory mechanisms by in silico sequence analysis. in the present work discriminant analysis has been successfully applied to identify novel nf-κb-regulated genes in pancreatic beta-cells. the discriminant classifier was developed based on the matrix score profiles of putative tfbss in the upstream sequences of nf-κb-regulated and non-regulated genes and showed reasonable predictive power. the results obtained provide new insights into the modeling of gene networks regulating cytokine-induced beta-cell dysfunction and death, and open several new avenues for research. in future work, the method will be improved and applied for detecting the regulatory targets of other tfs, such as stat- <dig>  that also regulate key beta-cell genes implicated in beta-cell death  <cit> .

microarray gene expression data, in combination with the present and future in silico sequence analysis, will hopefully provide valuable tools to unravel the architecture of key beta-cell gene networks. the in silico work will help to characterize gene clusters regulated by similar transcription factors, and will focus the laborious promoter studies on selected genes. this combined approach will identify the genetic network structure of beta-cells and might generate new targets for drug design and imaging. for instance, and based on this approach, we have already developed in vivo approaches to prevent experimental diabetes by blocking nf-κb  <cit>  and stat- <dig>  <cit>  and identified several interesting targets for beta-cell imaging .

in conclusion, the present approach constitutes a "proof of principle" for the integrated use of functional genomics  <cit>  and bioinformatics  in the detailed molecular characterization of a relevant cell type for human pathology. by following this integrated approach, we expect to fully map the interacting networks of genes and proteins downstream of the pro-apoptotic signals leading to beta-cell death in t1dm. this will allow us to move the search for a cure for t1dm from an empiric and often blind approach to one that is really mechanistically driven – the ultimate outcome being the development of logical and targeted therapies to prevent the disease.
