BACKGROUND
brassica is a model system for studying polyploidization and speciation since all the species in this genus have descended from a common hexaploid ancestor  <cit> . in addition, brassica species share an ancestor with arabidopsis, implying a similar basic genome, and thereby providing sequence-level colinearity between the two genera, particularly in euchromatic regions  <cit> . this relationship highlights the feasibility of utilizing the accumulated arabidopsis information for the study of brassica species. the genus brassica includes economically important crop taxa with a wide range of morphologies, such as chinese cabbage, mustard, cabbage, broccoli, oilseed rape, and other leafy vegetables. these taxa are classified into six genome types  according to the six representative species , and the genomic relationships of these taxa are well defined in u's triangle  <cit> .

in view of the enomous value of brassica in the fields of agriculture and molecular biology, genome sequencing projects have been proposed for each of the three diploid genomes  <cit> . in order to better understand the a genome of brassica and to take advantage of the colinearity between this genome and the arabidopsis genome sequence, the multinational brassica rapa genome sequencing project  was launched in  <dig> by scientists from five countries  for sequencing b. rapa ssp. pekinensis cv. chiifu-401- <dig> using a bac-by-bac approach  <cit> . the initial objective of the brgsp was to sequence the gene space of b. rapa, which represents approximately  <dig> mb of its genome  <cit> , at a phase ii quality level, whereby bacs would be sequenced to a single ordered and oriented contig, but with allowance for some gaps and ambiguous bases  <cit> . the korean group of the brgsp  sequenced  <dig> b. rapa bacs selected to represent genomic regions collinear with the majority of the euchromatic regions of the a. thaliana genome  <cit> . these clones serve as "seed" bacs for the brgsp, from which chromosome-scale sequencing is being initiated. the developing brgsp has valuable resources for the community, including three bac libraries  <cit> ,  <dig>  bac end sequences  <cit> ,  <dig>  est sequences , and an initial-version reference genetic map  <cit> . to date,  <dig> bac sequences, representing approximately  <dig>  mb, have been made public  <cit> .

the initial reference linkage map of b. rapa was constructed with  <dig> markers  based on  <dig> doubled haploid lines  derived from an anther culture of the f <dig> of a cross between diverse chinese cabbage  inbred lines; "chiifu-401-42"  and "kenshin-402-43"   <cit> . ten linkage groups, designated as a1-a <dig> according to the common nomenclature of the b. napus reference linkage maps  <cit> , served as a reference for the brgsp. however, there remained ambiguity in reconciling the linkage groups with the  <dig> b. rapa chromosomes characterized using cytogenetic approaches.

the b. rapa chromosomes have been extensively studied by karyotyping based on morphometric measurements of mitotic metaphase chromosomes  <cit> . the definitive identification of each of the individual chromosomes has been problematic because some are small-sized or similar. recently, using fluorescence in situ hybridization , six of the  <dig> chromosomes were distinguished unambiguously based on the chromosomal position of repetitive sequences, such as 45s rdna, 25s rdna, 5s rdna, and centromeric repeats. however, this technique can be impractical in that multiple fishs are required to distinguish these six chromosomes, and it is unable to distinguish the remaining four chromosomes  <cit> . consequently, the brgsp assigned each of the linkage groups  to the project members as chromosomal substitutes for sequencing  <cit> .

in this study, we developed a second generation b. rapa reference linkage map, aligned unambiguously with the cytogenetic map of b. rapa. we also used our data to confirm and extend the comparative genome analysis of b. rapa and a. thaliana.

RESULTS
construction of the second generation reference linkage genetic map
of the  <dig> ssr motif-containing amplicons designed from  <dig> sequenced bacs,  <dig>  showed polymorphism between chiifu and kenshin . many amplicons designed from brassica sequences produce multiple bands as a consequence of the extensive genome duplication observed in these species. anchorage of sequenced bac clones to linkage maps therefore requires matching of the size of the pcr product from the bac  with the size of the polymorphic band amplified from genomic dna . this validation was conducted for all polymorphic markers. the polymorphic pcr product from the genomic dna was found to match the bac-derived product for  <dig> markers , all of which were designed from  <dig> different bac clones. there were several instances of the experimentally determined band being greater in size than was expected from the bac sequences. we attribute these differences to sequencing errors. the  <dig> bac-anchoring markers were added to the initial version of the b. rapa linkage map to produce the second generation linkage map . this map now anchors  <dig> sequenced bac clones to the b. rapa linkage map.

the linkage map contained  <dig> loci, comprising  <dig> aflp,  <dig> ssr,  <dig> rapd,  <dig> sts,  <dig> estp, and  <dig> caps markers, assigned to the  <dig> a genome linkage groups  of brassica species following established nomenclature  <cit> . the total length of the map was  <dig> . <dig> cm with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent loci . the length of the linkage groups ranged from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm , and the number of markers in the  <dig> linkage groups ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . in total,  <dig> % of the markers were mapped at the same loci or at less than 1-cm intervals. the average distance between adjacent loci was greatest for a <dig>  and least for a <dig> . two gaps of greater than  <dig> cm were present , measuring  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively.

aligning the linkage map with the arabidopsis genome sequence
in order to estimate the coverage of the linkage map with respect to the arabidopsis genome, we aligned the sequences of the anchored bacs to the arabidopsis genome sequence . of the  <dig> anchored bac clones,  <dig>  could be aligned. the aligned regions represent  <dig>  cm of the b. rapa linkage map and  <dig>  mb of the arabidopsis genome sequence .

we detected  <dig> blocks of conserved synteny, as defined by two or more adjacent anchored b. rapa bacs aligned to the corresponding region of the arabidopsis genome identified in the earlier maps for a genomes  <cit>  . if the extended positions were detected within our defined blocks of the b. rapa map , they were considered extensions of the previously reported blocks . blocks g, s, and h  were newly identified in the b. rapa linkage groups a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig>  respectively, compared with the a genome map of b. napus  <cit> . blocks g and h in the linkage groups of a <dig> and a <dig> were recognized in the a genome of b. juncea  <cit> , whereas block s in a <dig>  appeared to be unique to the b. rapa genome. the longest blocks were  <dig> - <dig>  cm on a <dig>  aligned to  <dig>  mb of arabidopsis chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig>  cm on a <dig>  aligned to  <dig>  mb of arabidopsis chromosome  <dig>  on average , we estimate that  <dig> cm of the b. rapa reference genetic map aligns to  <dig> kb of the arabidopsis genome sequence. however, the large standard deviation  indicates that this relationship varies greatly across the aligned genome segments. this alignment updated the initial version of the b. rapa linkage map  <cit> .

most of the alignments between the linkage map and the arabidopsis genome sequence were consistent with collinearity blocks previously inferred using sequenced markers with homology to single arabidopsis genes  <cit> . however, we identified the collinear regions for seven additional previously uncharacterized sections of the a genome by a single aligned bac, and confirmed three of these by mapping a second marker. the number and ranges of the arabidopsis gene models for which collinear homologous sequences could be identified were determined by using bac annotations of the brgsp  <cit> , and these are shown in table  <dig>

based on the  <dig> syntenic blocks, we detected  <dig> and  <dig> regions that were represented two and three times, respectively, within the b. rapa genome . all redundantly represented regions were detected between different linkage groups, except one region represented three times, which was identified from two regions in a <dig> and one in a <dig> aligned to a  <dig> - <dig>  mb region of arabidopsis chromosome  <dig>  the total sizes of the regions represented two and three times in the b. rapa genome were  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb, respectively, based on the sizes of the corresponding arabidopsis regions. this result indicates that  <dig>  mb of the arabidopsis genome corresponds to  <dig>  mb of the b. rapa genome. the detected redundant regions were smaller than  <dig>  mb , indicating the scale of the maintained regions after hexapolyploidization. these genetically redundant regions were detected by the same cutoff value of sequence similarity, demonstrating that the regions had emerged simultaneously and undergone the same evolutionary events.

alignment of b. rapa linkage groups and karyotype
the b. rapa chromosomes are too small and compact to be distinguished by either morphological characteristics or the chromosome arm length ratio. in order to develop markers for complete karyotyping of these chromosomes, bac clones genetically anchored on our reference genetic map were searched for repetitiveness by sequence similarities or fish analysis. consequently,  <dig> sets of nonrepetitive bac clones  were selected to distinguish the  <dig> chromosomes and were fluorescence in situ hybridized on metaphase chromosomes . the fluorescence signals of each set of bac clones  were detected from each pair of  <dig> chromosomes , confirming the utility of bacs in distinguishing the chromosomes. six chromosomes hybridized by the selected bac clones from a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig> were recognized to be chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, based on the following previously reported remarks:  the largest chromosome for chromosome  <dig>   the nor-bearing chromosome for chromosome  <dig>   the 45s rdna- and centbr2-hybridized chromosome for chromosome  <dig>   the 45s rdna-only-hybridized chromosome for chromosome  <dig>   the 45s rdna- and 5s rdna-hybridized chromosome for chromosome  <dig>  and  the 5s rdna-only-hybridized chromosome for chromosome  <dig> . the four remaining chromosomes hybridized by bacs from a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig> were assigned to chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. this designation was based solely on the sizes of the four chromosomes, which were numbered from the largest to the smallest in accordance with chromosome morphology  <cit> .

the  <dig> sets of bac clones distinguishing each chromosome were defined as the definite karyotyping markers for the  <dig> chromosomes of b. rapa. in order to ensure the reliability of the markers, one bac marker from each of the eight chromosome sets , was rehybridized onto one set of b. rapa chromosomes . consequently, all eight bacs were hybridized onto individual chromosome pairs, and chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were recognized by the morphological remarks , thus demonstrating the utility of the developed markers. the current orientations of four linkage groups   <cit>  are incorrect based on the orientation of chromosomes deduced from fish signals , and should be reversed.

discussion
the second generation reference genetic map of b. rapa
a high density linkage map of b. rapa was constructed, resulting in an average marker density of one marker per  <dig>  cm and the anchoring of  <dig> sequenced bac clones. the ssr markers developed from these bac sequences were validated by matching the sizes of the chiifu alleles of the polymorphic band with the pcr product from the corresponding bac clone. approximately 57% of the markers on the map were of the ssr type, which are likely to be transferable to studies involving other brassica species and populations. moreover, the  <dig> sequenced bac clones anchored on the reference genetic map will serve as a basis for integrating the physical map of b. rapa  <cit>  with the reference genetic map.

anchoring of the sequenced bacs onto the genetic map provided opportunities for aligning the reference map onto the arabidopsis genome sequence on the basis of sequence similarity. although arabidopsis and b. rapa diverged approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , and underwent reshuffling during their respective evolutions, extensive collinearity was maintained between their genomes. on the basis of the  <dig> blocks of conserved synteny detected in this study, we illustrated possible contractions in the b. rapa genome. for example, in blocks  <dig> and  <dig>  we estimated that  <dig> cm of the b. rapa map aligns with  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb of the arabidopsis genome, respectively. in addition to the identified regions represented twice within the b. rapa genome , the detected regions represented three times in the genome  were similarly divergent in each case in that they were distinguished by the same level of sequence similarity. this supports the hypothesis that proposes the existence of a hexaploid ancestor in the evolution of brassica species  <cit> .

most of the alignments between the linkage map and the arabidopsis genome sequence are consistent with previously identified collinearity blocks  <cit> . these were initially inferred for b. napus using sequenced markers with homology to single arabidopsis genes  <cit> , and subsequently extended across a number of brassicaceae  <cit> . however, our alignments are considerably more robust, as they exploit sequences of whole bac clones containing homologies to multiple collinear arabidopsis gene models. further, the alleles present in the bac clones can be matched to the mapped bands in the marker assays. this advantage overcomes the "noise" encountered in comparative genomics as a consequence of homologies to transduplicated gene fragments  <cit>  and enabled us to identify seven previously unreported collinearity blocks. two of the newly discovered collinearity blocks, represented by bac clones kbrs008c11/kbrb058b <dig> and kbrh014m <dig>  correspond to parts of blocks g and h, respectively, of the proposed brassicaceae ancestral karyotype linkage group ak <dig>  <cit> . to date, these have been identified in only a single copy, and these newly discovered copies appear to represent one more of the three proposed paralogs of each that are expected to have arisen as a result of the proposed hexaploidy event in the ancestry of the brassica species  <cit> . block k, represented by kbrb072e <dig>  also represents a third copy of the paralogs. block m, not recognized in the a genome of b. napus  <cit> , was identified. a newly discovered collinearity block represented by bac clones kbrb080j <dig>  kbrs012d <dig>  and kbrh097m <dig> correspond to parts of blocks c, n, and s, respectively. these represent the fourth copies of the blocks to be identified, only three copies having being described by schranz et al.  <cit> . we interpret the discovery of these blocks as an indication that supernumerary segmental genome duplications, as described for the genomic regions containing the b. rapa orthologs of the arabidopsis gene flc  <cit> , could be common. five of these blocks  were recognized in the a genome of b. juncea  <cit> , supporting our new findings.

integration of the reference genetic map with the  <dig> chromosomes of b. rapa
the twenty bac clones used in this study were nonrepetitive and genetically anchored, thus allowing integration of the physical and genetic maps with each chromosome. as reported previously, comparative genetic mapping between arabidopsis and b. rapa has revealed that collinear regions of the genomes are represented two or three times in b. rapa  <cit> . jackson et al.  <cit>  reported multiple duplications of the unique locus on arabidopsis chromosome  <dig>  in the b. rapa genome by showing bac fish signals from four to six b. rapa chromosomes. in our study, some bacs were located at the loci represented twice  or three times  based on the arabidopsis alignment data . however, they were sufficiently divergent, showing unique hybridization and a single bac fish signal.

when the brgsp was launched in  <dig>  the genome was assigned to participating countries by linkage groups, because at that time the chromosomes were not reconciled with the linkage groups. the previously reported karyotyping of b. rapa was based on chromosome length, and/or fish patterns of repetitive dnas  <cit> . from these studies, six chromosomes were distinguished unambiguously based on the chromosomal position of 45s rdna, 25s rdna, 5s rdna, and centromeric repeats, whereas the remaining four chromosomes were ambiguous. fukui et al.  <cit> , snowdon et al.  <cit> , and koo et al.  <cit>  designated the recognized chromosomes to chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in association with chromosomes of the brassica species, corresponding to chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of lim et al.  <cit> , respectively. these discrepancies in assigning chromosome numbers are due to the specific characteristics of brassica chromosomes, which are small and compact, causing different decisions on chromosome length order in the different studies, particularly with metaphase chromosomes. as described earlier, matching chromosomes in different studies in terms of chromosome length is sometimes difficult, and thus emphasizes the importance of the karyotype markers used in this study, which standardize the karyotype. our chromosome nomenclature is consistent with earlier reports by fukui et al.  <cit> , and these have been reinforced by snowdon et al.  <cit>  and koo et al.  <cit> .

fish has been used not only for chromosome identification  <cit>  but also for merging genetic, physical, and chromosomal maps  <cit> , thereby providing information about genome organization. the first integration of the cytogenetic and genetic linkage maps in brassica species was achieved in cc genome species by fish using  <dig> probes representing  <dig> loci of nine chromosomes  <cit> . in the present study, we assigned all  <dig> linkage groups of the b. rapa reference genetic map to each of the  <dig> chromosomes and corrected the orientation of the linkage groups by fish. the  <dig> cytologically mapped loci will serve as the basis for integration of the genetic, physical, and chromosomal maps of b. rapa in the multinational brgsp.

CONCLUSIONS
we constructed a second generation reference linkage map of b. rapa, which has an average marker density of  <dig> marker per  <dig>  cm and to which  <dig> sequenced bac clones are anchored. anchoring of the sequenced bacs onto the reference genetic map provided opportunities for aligning the map onto the arabidopsis genome sequence on the basis of sequence similarity. we detected  <dig> blocks of conserved synteny between the b. rapa and arabidopsis genomes, illustrating rearrangement events with a trace of hexapolyploidy differentiating these genomes. most of these were consistent with previously reported collinear blocks; however, we were able to identify seven regions as individual bac clones or a pair of overlapping bac clones, representing previously unreported collinearity blocks. one of these represents a previously "missing" block under the hypothesis of whole genome triplication, and three of the remaining blocks represent a supernumerary segment under the same hypothesis.

nonrepetitive and genetically anchored bac clones allowed integration of the genetic map with the cytogenetic map by developing definite karyotype markers. this is the first unambiguous alignment of the linkage map with the  <dig> b. rapa chromosomes. we envision that the genetic map and analysis presented here will serve as a basis for integrating the genetic, physical, and chromosomal maps of b. rapa in the multinational brgsp as well as for studies on polyploidization and speciation in the genus brassica.
