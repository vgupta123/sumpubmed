BACKGROUND
high soil salinity, a devastating environmental stress, typically causes major reductions in crop productivity and quality  <cit> . over  <dig> million hectares, equivalent to  <dig> % of the world’s total land area, are currently estimated to be impacted by high salt concentration  <cit> . in china, approximately  <dig> million hectares distributed over  <dig> provinces have been affected by increased salinity  <cit> . to stabilize global crop production, the problem of salinity must be urgently addressed.

salt stress generally induces a combination of dehydration/osmotic-related effects and damage as a consequence of excess sodium ions that greatly affect plant growth and crop production  <cit> . osmotic stress and na+ stress are considered to be the two major components of the plant salt-stress response  <cit> . plants employ various mechanisms to deal with salt stress; these mechanisms include minimization of the amount of salt taken up by roots and its partitioning at tissue and cellular levels to avoid buildup of toxic concentrations in the cytosol of functional leaves  <cit> . much effort has been devoted to revealing the molecular mechanisms of plant salt tolerance, with the ultimate goal of improving salt tolerance of crop plants.

cotton  is not only the world’s leading textile fiber, but is also a major oil crop. although cotton is the second most salt-tolerant herbaceous crop  <cit> , its growth and productivity are adversely affected by high salinity, especially at germination and the young seedling stage  <cit> . salinity suppresses primary root growth  <cit> , inhibits the length and numbers of secondary roots  <cit> , and limits photosynthesis and respiration, flowering, boll and fiber quality, and ion uptake in cotton, resulting in significant yield losses  <cit> . salt stress has also been found to regulate the expression level of many genes in different bio-processes and pathways, including morphological adaptation, maintenance of ion homeostasis, cell signal transduction, and oxidative stress mitigation . identifying salt-tolerance genes is an important component of the breeding of salt-tolerant crop plants through genetic engineering. although many genes controlling response to high salinity have been identified in model plants, only a few salt stress-inducible genes, such as nhx <dig>   <cit> , dreb   <cit> , erf  , nac   <cit> , metallothionein   <cit> , ghmpk2
 <cit> , ghmkk1
 <cit> , and ccch-type zinc finger   <cit>  have been documented in cotton. with recent advances in genomic sequencing and transcriptome mapping , some salt-related genes and regulatory factors have been identified in cotton on a large scale at the genome-wide level . nevertheless, the molecular basis of cotton tolerance to salt stress remains to be discovered.

small rnas are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. mirnas are a highly conserved class of endogenous, non-coding rnas that range in length from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides   <cit> . in plants, cleavage or translational repression of target mrna appears to be the prevalent method of post-transcriptional regulation  <cit> . current findings that some plant mirnas respond to stress conditions and that some mirna targets are stress-related genes suggest that mirnas play important roles in plant stress response. mirna expression profiles in response to salt stress have been analyzed in arabidopsis thaliana
 <cit> , oryza sativa
 <cit> , zea mays  <cit> , gossypium hirsutum
 <cit> , and caragana intermedia
 <cit> . in addition to studying the effects of stress on mirnas, the identification of mirna targets is important. among cotton cultivars, however, some mirnas related to salt tolerance have been found to differ . little is known regarding their expression profiles in response to salt stress, and their roles in salt adaptation remain unclear.

transcriptome  analysis has recently emerged as a powerful approach to excavate large numbers of genes and mirna sequences  <cit> . although some differentially expressed salt-related genes have been identified by this technique after short- or long-term salt treatment, comparative transcriptional changes in response to salt stress between early and late periods have not been reported. an additional limitation is that most reported gene expression profiles related to salt resistance have been derived from a single genotype . in those studies, it was consequently difficult to accurately distinguish true salt tolerance-related genes from salt-responsive ones. furthermore, most research for salt stress focused on root  <cit> . however, the previous results show that when subjected to salt stress in upland cotton, mostly absorbed na+ accumulated in the shoot through the roots, and the root of k+ transport to the leaves to maintain high k+/ na+ in the leaves  <cit> . otherwise, in our study, na+ concentration in leaf also showed significant difference between two lines , lower na+ concentration could reduce the damage of leaf photosynthesis, further improved the salt tolerance. these results indicated that the shoot, especially the leaves of salt tolerant cotton must have some special mechanisms to alleviate na+ toxicity under salt stress, therefore, we chose the leaf as object of study. thus, comparative analyses of gene and mirna expression in seedling leaves during two stages of salt stress may further elucidate molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance in cotton.figure  <dig>

to obtain insights into the initial transcriptional regulation and differential expression of functional genes in response to high salinity, we exposed two cotton genotypes  to salt stress for 0–72 h. we then compared dynamic changes in ion accumulation and osmotic adjustment between earlistaple  <dig> and nan dan ba di da hua and analyzed the expression profiles of responsive genes and mirnas. according to their expression patterns, salt stress-inducible genes could be broadly discerned as early-, late-, and sustained-induced regulated genes, and their functional significance was characterized. we also identified and characterized conserved mirnas in the two genotypes at two time points  under salt stress. putative target genes of these mirnas were predicted from the transcripts by computational methods. we established a model of the mirna-mediated regulatory network by combining the mrna-seq and small rna-seq information. our comprehensive physiological- and molecular-level analysis of salt stress responses should facilitate illumination of the mechanisms of salt stress tolerance in g. hirsutum.

RESULTS
physiological differences between salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant genotypes under salinity stress
genotypes nan dan ba di da hua and earlistaple  <dig> were subjected to short-term salinity stress  at the seedling stage for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 72-h. seedling response to salt was evaluated based on leaf relative water content , relative electrical conductivity , and chlorophyll and ion  content of leaves and roots .

highly significant  differences were observed in leaf rwc and chlorophyll content between the two genotypes after 48- and 24-h salt treatments, respectively, although these values were sharply decreased in both genotypes after 4 h of exposure to nacl compared with controls . after  <dig> and 24 h of treatment, the rec of nan dan ba di da hua was highly significantly  increased throughout the duration of stress, while that of earlistaple  <dig> was maintained at a lower level. after 48 h, however, the recs of the two genotypes were similar . as shown in figure 1d–f, leaf and root na+ concentrations increased in both genotypes under salinity stress. characteristically, nan dan ba di da hua roots accrued less na+ as compared with earlistaple  <dig> , whereas earlistaple  <dig> contained a significantly lower level of leaf na+ . this difference can probably be attributed to the higher na+ absorption capacity of roots of salt-tolerant earlistaple  <dig> compared with salt-sensitive nan dan ba di da hua, which prevents the transport of excessive na+ to the seedling shoots.

visual damage owing to salinity stress appeared on the leaves of nan dan ba di da hua beginning approximately  <dig> to 72 h after 200-mm nacl treatment. after  <dig>  h, distinct wilting and dehydration caused by osmotic stress  <cit>  was observed on leaves of both genotypes. by 4 h, both genotypes showed more severe wilting, which was followed by gradual recovery to an upright position . the restoration of earlistaple  <dig> was obviously better than that of nan dan ba di da hua, which experienced slight wilting of cotyledons and old leaves, and dry necrosis of leaf edges. after 48 h, these phenomena were markedly more noticeable in both genotypes, although plants of earlistaple  <dig> were in much better condition than those of nan dan ba di da hua. according to the above results, significant physiological and morphological differences were observed at different salt-treatment time points in response to salt stress, which was accordingly divided into two typical phases: dehydration stress  and ionic stress . we therefore selected these two time points for further study.

de novomrna-seq assembly and annotation of non-redundant unigenes
six cdna and six small rna libraries were constructed from total rna extracted from 14-day-old seedling leaves of two upland cottons  treated with 200 mm nacl  for  <dig> and 24 h.

sample data from the six different libraries are summarized in table  <dig>  after quality control, approximately  <dig> , <dig> valid reads and roughly  <dig>  gb of nucleotides were obtained. the overall data retention rate was high , and the data quality was acceptable. because the whole-genome sequence of upland cotton is currently not publically available, the valid reads from the six libraries were merged for de novo assembly . after removal of repeats from the spliced sequences,  <dig>  transcripts with lengths ≥200 bp were obtained. the total length of all transcripts was approximately 236 mb. the longest transcript for each locus was taken as the unigene, resulting in  <dig>  unigenes comprising about 54 mb of nucleotides . the length of these assembled unigenes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp. the overall length distribution and gc content of the spliced unigenes are presented in additional file  <dig> table  <dig>

note: the n <dig> size is computed by sorting all transcripts from largest to smallest and by determining the minimum set of transcripts whose sizes total 50% of the entire transcript and unigene was the same; n <dig> was counted in the similar way.



functional annotation of transcripts was mainly based on blast  homology searches against various public protein databases . of the  <dig>  non-redundant unigenes,  <dig>   showed a significant similarity to known proteins in the nr database and  <dig>   had significant hits in the swiss-prot database. these results suggested an abundance of newly discovered unigenes. gene ontology  analysis classified most of the  <dig>  annotated unigenes into go functional categories of biological process, cellular component, and molecular function .table  <dig>

identification of salt-responsive, differentially expressed unigenes
to identify genes displaying significant expression changes during nacl treatment, differentially expressed unigenes  were analyzed by comparing 4- and 24-h libraries with the control library for both nan dan ba di da hua and earlistaple  <dig> . salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant genotypes showed very similar expression patterns. as the salt treatment duration lengthened, an increasing number of gene expression changes were observed in both genotypes. in addition, the number of up-regulated genes in the salt-tolerant genotype  was more than in salt-sensitive genotype.table  <dig>

transcription factors  play key roles in modulating the acclimation response of plants to severe environments. in our study,  <dig> %  of the  <dig>  unigenes encoding tf family members in earlistaple  <dig> and nan dan ba di da hua were responsive to 4- and 24-h treatments with 200 mm nacl. these unigenes were classified into  <dig> tf families and  <dig> group of putative tfs , including several key regulatory gene families involved in response to abiotic and biotic stress, such as ap2-erebp , arf , bhlh , bzip , c2c2-dof , c2h <dig> , dbp , gras , hb , myb , nac , and wrky . among these tfs, ap2-erebp, myb, nac, and wrky members unigenes were mostly up-regulated under salt stress, while bhlh and c2c <dig> families were represented by a balanced number of up- and down-regulated members . many identified tfs belonged to ap2/erebp, and most were involved in stress response. these results imply that ap2/erebp family members play an important role in regulation of salt stress tolerance in g. hirsutum. myb, nac, and wrky were also highly enriched during 4- and 24-h salt stress .figure  <dig>

dynamic change analysis of co-expressed unigenes
to understand dynamic expression patterns of deus under salt stress at different time points, the various gene expression modes in earlistaple  <dig> were identified. the most representative significantly deu expression mode was then selected for further analysis. to uncover the mechanisms underlying salt sensitivity in nan dan ba di da hua, we used short time-series expression miner  software to analyze abundance changes of differentially expressed tf unigenes and other significant functional unigenes filtered by different genotypes at different time points. the analytical procedure used is outlined in additional file  <dig> 

the functional enrichment of genes with distinct patterns  in earlistaple  <dig> was also analyzed using stem software. seven significant expression profiles  were identified. as shown in figure 3a, significantly different profiles were represented by different background colors . according to the background color, the seven most representative expression patterns were divided into two clusters, one containing four and one containing three profiles. unigenes within the same cluster were considered to be co-expressed genes following the same expression pattern. differentially expressed unigenes of earlistaple  <dig> at two time points  were selected from the two clusters and subjected to go category gene enrichment analysis. the two unigene set comparisons  that were enriched  for certain go categories  are shown in figure 3b. the  <dig> most abundant go terms into which e4/e <dig> and e24/e <dig> unigene sets were distributed included many abiotic stress-related categories, such as “transferase activity”, “nucleic acid binding”, “nucleotide binding”, and “ion binding”. in addition, several go terms showed significant differences in enrichment between 4- and 24-h salt treatments, with “response to stress”, “regulation of biological process”, “transcription factor activity”, and “structural constituent of ribosome” most prominent. it is increasingly clear that stress and metabolic signaling networks interact, and that this interaction is important in plant response to abiotic stresses  <cit> . the remaining clusters were not enriched for go categories because of the many unannotated genes in the transcriptome, suggesting that numerous pathways involved in stress tolerance are yet to be revealed.figure  <dig>

all differentially co-expressed unigenes were classified into three categories according to the significantly different expression patterns identified . we also performed a stem cluster analysis of all deus from the earlistaple  <dig> genotype , which revealed six distinct groups: early-stage up-regulated genes , late-stage up-regulated genes , continuously up-regulated genes , early-stage down-regulated genes , late-stage down-regulated genes , and continuously down-regulated genes . go categories were assigned to deus in the six data sets  . in the biological process category, go classification of deus in the three data sets of expressed unigenes that were common to both genotypes at  <dig>   <dig>  and both  <dig> and 24 h was similar, but the number of commonly expressed unigenes between the two genotypes at 4 h was less than the number at  <dig> and both  <dig> and 24 h . in the molecular function category, the four most abundant subcategories in the three data sets of earlistaple-7-specific unigenes were nucleic acid binding, nucleotide binding, transferase activity, and ion binding .table  <dig>

analysis of salt stress-responsive tfs and other salt tolerance-related functional genes
although expression patterns of many unigenes were similar between earlistaple  <dig> and nan dan ba di da hua,  <dig> % of salt-responsive unigenes identified in earlistaple  <dig> were more or less differentially expressed  <  <dig> ) in nan dan ba di da hua at one or more time points . tfs are important regulators of gene expression. the related the expression abundance and annotation information of tf unigenes in the six data sets by stem analysis were obtained .

an overlap was only observed in tf unigenes responsive to nacl stress between earlistaple  <dig> and nan dan ba di da hua at the 4-h time point, with  <dig> tfs transcriptionally up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated . these differentially expressed tfs belonging to ap2-erebp family were followed in abundance by wrky, nac, myb, and c2h <dig> under 4- and 24-h nacl treatment . it should be noted that all of these deus were expressed in the salt-tolerant genotype earlistaple  <dig>  but were repressed, weakly induced, or not induced at all in salt-sensitive nan dan ba di da hua . some of these weakly/non-induced genes, such as ghnac <dig>  ghnac <dig>  ghwrky <dig>  gherf <dig>  and ghdreb1l, play very important roles in salt tolerance of cotton .table  <dig> 
the specific transcription factor unigenes response to salt stress in earlistaple 7




under nacl stress, most of the salt-responsive tf unigenes exhibited genotype specificity. we identified  <dig> tf unigenes whose expressions were specific to earlistaple  <dig>  of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were suppressed under salt stress . these  <dig> tf unigenes, which corresponded to  <dig> % of the  <dig>  salt-responsive genes of earlistaple  <dig>  were only expressed during either early or late stages of salt stress. we note that some tf unigene families expressed under both 4- and 24-h salt stress were identical to the above-mentioned tf families commonly expressed in both genotypes, but the expressed tf was different. the expression trend of the wrky tf unigene  was different at the two time points—decreasing at the beginning and then increasing, while that of others, such as ap2-erebp, myb, hb, nac, wrky, and bhlh family members, experienced a continual rise.

many other salt tolerance-related unigenes encoding transporters, ca2+ binding protein, heat-shock proteins , detoxificants, and dehydration-response proteins were differentially expressed under 4- and 24-h salt stress . several differentially expressed genes encoded transporters contributing to the re-establishment of ionic and osmotic homeostasis under salt stress, such as abc transporters , sodium/hydrogen exchanger , atpases , potassium transporter, and nitrate transporter. genes encoding some ca2+ sensors, namely cml and cpk, and one cbl-interacting protein kinase  gene were identified in the different libraries. two cotton cbl genes  were highly expressed under 4- and/or 24-h salt stress in earlistaple  <dig>  unigenes encoding cdpk and cipk members were up-regulated under 4- and/or 24-h salt stress in both genotypes. genes from several hsp families  as well as genes related to reactive oxygen species  scavenging and detoxification  and dehydration response  were highly up-regulated at different salt-treatment time points either in earlistaple  <dig> or nan dan ba di da hua . finally, genes involved in salt-stress tolerance pathways, such as cdpk, starch and sucrose metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and mapk signal pathways, were found to be induced at different time points. these identified unigenes are potentially salt-induced genes and may serve as a supplementary resource for salt-tolerance gene mining.

to further validate the results of mrna sequencing,  <dig> transcripts were randomly selected along with their specific primers for quantitative real-time pcr  analysis . eleven of the  <dig> tested transcripts had expression patterns identical to those observed in the mrna-seq experiments . expression levels measured by qrt-pcr were strongly correlated with those of deus identified by mrna-seq , demonstrating the reliability of the mrna-seq results .figure  <dig>

deep sequencing of small rnas and identification of conserved mirnas under salt stress
to characterize differences between nan dan ba di da hua and earlistaple  <dig> at the mirna regulatory level and to identify conserved mirnas in cotton under salt stress, we constructed and analyzed six small rna libraries of the two genotypes. a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads ranging in length from  <dig> to 35 nt were generated. after removing adapter sequences, low-quality tags, and reads shorter than 18 nt, we obtained  <dig> , <dig> clean reads, which corresponded to more than  <dig> million unique sequences for each sample . as shown in additional file 6b, most small rnas were 20–24 nt in size; the 24-nt class was the most heavily represented  in the nan dan ba di da hua small rna control library, followed by 23-nt , 21-nt , and 22-nt classes .

the six libraries of clean reads were compared against trnadb, silva rrna, and noncode v <dig>  databases, allowing for mismatches. detailed results of this comparison are shown in table  <dig>  after annotation and removal of non-coding small rnas,  <dig> conserved mirnas were identified and grouped into  <dig> mirna families, with those belonging to unknown families designated by “na” comparison of the six libraries against the mirbase <dig>  database, which contains  <dig> known ghr  mirnas, identified  <dig> conserved mirnas belonging to  <dig> families, including three families that are cotton-specific: mir <dig> , mir <dig> , and mir <dig>  .table  <dig>

the number of identified mirnas and the abundance of mirna families are listed in additional file 6c–d and additional file  <dig>  the reads for each mirna family were normalized as “reads per million mapped reads” . among mirna families, mir <dig> exhibited the highest abundance . other highly expressed families, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  were represented by approximately  <dig>  rpm, whereas mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> families had less than  <dig> rpm. differences among mirna families were also revealed by the number of members they contained . mir <dig> was the largest family, with  <dig> members, while mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> possessed  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> members, respectively. different family members also displayed drastically different expression levels . in the mir <dig> family, for instance, rpm of ghr-mir156a was  <dig> in the control nan dan ba di da hua library, while the rpm of cca-mir156b was only  <dig> .

we identified mirnas that were differentially expressed  between treatment and control  from  <dig> families . as shown in figure 6a, the differentially expressed mirnas were transcriptionally regulated at different time points in the two genotypes under salt stress. we detected both congruously and oppositely regulated mirnas as well as those that were genotype-specific . further analysis revealed that most differentially expressed mirnas displayed different expression patterns between the two genotypes or the two time points . these results demonstrate that mirna expression changes in cotton under early- and late-stage  salt stress are similar, and that differential regulation of mirnas may be responsible for the distinct salt sensitivities of the two cotton genotypes.figure  <dig>

combined analysis of conserved mirnas and their target genes under salt stress
to discover salt tolerance-related mirnas in cotton, we used the analytical approach shown in additional file 9c. we uncovered  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas and compared their expressions in the two genotypes . at least one comparison  showed significant changes at the p <  <dig>  level. by incorporating the transcriptome sequencing results into the comparisons e4/e <dig> and e24/e <dig> for all  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas under salt stress, we detected  <dig> and  <dig>  mirna-target pairs, respectively. generally, micrornas negatively regulate the accumulation of their target mrnas therefore when they are expressed in common tissue, their expression profiles should show negative correlation  <cit> . but  <cit>  found an equal number of positively and negatively correlated mirna/target pairs indicating that positive correlation is more frequent than previously thought  <cit> . in our research, we attempted to reveal the molecular regulation mechanism of salt tolerance in upland cotton, microrna might played an important role during the response process. therefore, the first step was to found out the correlationship between mirna expression and target mrna expression, we calculated pearson correlation coefficients  between mirnas and their targets. the pccs between all  <dig> and  <dig>  mirnas and their target pairs were - <dig>  and  <dig>  at 4-h and 24-h in earlistaple  <dig>  respectively, indicating no correlations . then we found these mirna were grouped into three categories: positively correlated, negatively correlated, and not correlated according to their target gene expression. it is obviously the no significant correlation between total mirnas and their targets maybe result from the opposite effects of the positively and negatively correlation of the mirna/target pairs. therefore, we should separate the positively correlated and negatively correlated mirna/gene pairs for further analysis based on the previous studies  <cit> , the pcc and linear regression analysis of the positively and negatively correlated mirna/gene pairs were shown in figure 7b, c, e, f. these results suggested that negative correlation is similar to the positive correlation and complex regulatory networks exist between mirnas and their targets in cotton under salt stress. finally, after excluding unannotated target unigenes from e4/e <dig> and e24/e <dig> comparisons, we respectively obtained  <dig> and  <dig> negative mirna-target gene relationships to further analysis . when go categories were assigned to these targets, six molecular function categories predominated; among these, “hydrolase activity”, “nucleoside binding”, and “nucleotide binding” were the most highly represented. fourteen biological processes were identified, the most frequent being “cellular metabolic process” and “primary metabolic process”. with respect to cellular components, seven classes were uncovered, with “intracellular part” and “cell part” the most abundant . these classifications suggest that mirna targets associated with salt tolerance are primarily related to binding, catalytic activity, cellular metabolic, and other metabolic processes.figure  <dig>

to elucidate the potential regulatory roles of mirnas in cotton under salt stress, we analyzed differential expression profiles of  <dig> mirnas in earlistaple  <dig> and nan dan ba di da hua . according to the results of hierarchical cluster analysis,  <dig> of these representative conserved mirnas exhibited significant differential expression during salt stress and were selected six clusters  were selected from a whole sub-branch by hierarchical cluster analysis which indicated they presented a very similar expression pattern . to better understand the functions of the  <dig> representative conserved mirnas and seven specifically expressed conserved mirnas, we predicted their putative targets .figure  <dig>

the expression patterns of nine conserved mirnas were validated by stem-loop rt-pcr . as expected, the stem-loop rt-pcr data showed a high degree of consistency with the expression profiles obtained by small rna sequencing. these data also revealed that two mirna targets were negatively regulated by their mirnas. as shown in figure 10b, at-mir393a expression increased between  <dig> and 24 h of salt treatment, whereas comp105131_c0_seq <dig>  expression decreased, with its transcript levels negatively correlated with the accumulation of at-mir393a. relative expression of ptc-mir164f was reduced to low levels at  <dig> and 24 h of salt treatment, while the expression level of its target gene  remained unchanged, compared with the controls, during this period.figure  <dig>

discussion
prerequisites for identification of candidate salt tolerance-related genes and mirnas in cotton
two main factors are responsible for salt stress-induced inhibition of plant growth: osmotic stress and ionic stress  <cit> . different mechanisms control development at different time points in plants exposed to salinity. in this study, we monitored the physiological responses of two cotton genotypes with differing salt tolerances at two distinct phases. we found that these phases were characterized by increases or decreases of clusters of differentially expressed genes and mirnas.

the positive relationship between water content and na+ concentration causes ions to accumulate in vacuoles, which lowers water potential, increases the driving force for water uptake, and increases turgor  <cit> . maintenance of k+ and na+ homeostasis is crucial under salt stress  <cit> . our study results suggest that after being taken up by the roots, na + is transported to shoots through the stems and the roots of salt-tolerant genotype earlistaple  <dig> were able to retain more na+ than nan dan ba di da hua . to avoid excessive ion accumulation in roots owing to continued na+ uptake, compensatory decreases in other cations occurred in the roots at 24 h. shoot leaves accumulated na+ in addition to the cations already present, with the tolerant genotype thereby experiencing the strongest ionic stress beginning at 24 h .

by examining these dynamics, we gained insights into physiological responses of the nacl-acclimation process, which consisted of an initial dehydration phase in leaves  and subsequent nacl accumulation  followed by restoration of osmotic homeostasis at a new ionic stress level  and either final adjustment to a steady ion balance or ion-induced damage . the timing of these adaptive responses differed between roots and leaves. in previous studies, either roots or leaves were used to identify differences between early and late transcriptional responses to salt treatment in cotton . our study of two genotypes with contrasting salt tolerances revealed that na+ accumulated mainly in shoots, and that significant physiological and morphological differences occurred at different time points under salt stress: 4 h  and 24 h . these two important time points thus corresponded to the two typical phases of plant growth response to salt stress.

in some studies, genes differentially expressed in response to salt treatment have been identified using a single plant genotype . two or more genotypes with contrasting salt tolerance have only been used in a few reported investigations . to identify genes responsible for salt tolerance, analysis of genotypes with similar genetic backgrounds and contrasting salt tolerances is preferable. identification of common genes that are differentially expressed under stress conditions between tolerant and sensitive genotypes with different genetic backgrounds has been suggested as an alternative approach  <cit> . as pointed out in  <cit> , it is impossible to isolate stress tolerance-related genes from stress-responsive ones unless transcriptional-level differences are compared between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under stress conditions  <cit> . genes related to salt tolerance can thus be identified in genotypes with different genetic background and contrasting tolerances by comparative analysis of differentially expressed genes and mirnas at different salt-treatment time points. we therefore used a pair of salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive genotypes in this study to identify differentially expressed genes and mirnas.

abundance of differentially expressed tf unigenes in response to salt stress in tolerant and sensitive genotypes
to govern necessary transcriptional regulation in response to developmental and environmental conditions, plant genomes encode a large number of tfs. in the present study, we identified  <dig>  tf unigenes  by global tf classification of deus. many tfs in the ap2/erebp family, followed to a lesser extent by wrky, myb, nac, dbp, bhlh, c2h <dig>  c3h, c2c <dig>  and ccaat family members, were up-regulated during salt stress . some members of these families have been reported to participate in abiotic stress response, suggesting their roles in plant adaptation to stress . seven unigene clusters were significantly assigned as comprising co-expressed genes according to stem . the mechanism responsible for these gene co-expression clusters is unclear, although the co-expression of clustered genes may be partially regulated by the interaction of common elements and tfs  <cit> . a previous promoter analysis has suggested that some of these co-expressed genes may be regulated by common tfs  <cit> . in light of the above views, we separated out the differentially co-expressed unigenes from all differentially expressed genes encoding tfs to identify the types of tfs regulating response to 4- and 24-h salt stress .

salt-responsive tf unigenes in the two cotton genotypes
dramatic changes were observed in tf unigene abundance and types  at 4- and 24-h salt-stress time points in the two contrasting genotypes. among these changes,  <dig> tf unigenes  exhibited similar patterns of altered expression between the two genotypes. this dramatic variation is consistent with the plant switching from normal growth and development to stress-specific responses. our observation is the first reported up-regulation of ghbzip, ghdreb1c, ghmyb, ghmyb <dig>  and ghwaky under 4- and 24-h salt-stress treatment. atrap2- <dig> and atrap2- <dig>  homologs of cotton genes ghert and gberf <dig>  are reported to increase rapidly in arabidopsis under salt stress  <cit> . our results illuminate the roles of these genes in response to salt stress . in an earlier study, bhlh family member ghbhlh <dig> was transitorily induced in leaves by abscisic acid  and polyethylene glycol treatments  <cit> . in our study, ghbhlh <dig> was significantly up-regulated , indicating its additional involvement in cotton salt-stress response. seven tf genes  were identified at 4- and 24-h salt-stress time points, suggesting that their protein products may play an important role in salt-stress response in addition to the involvement in aba signaling uncovered in previous research  <cit> . transcripts encoding c2h2-type zinc finger proteins  that have been implicated in salt stress tolerance were up-regulated under 4- and 24-h salt stress. overexpression of c2h2-type zinc finger proteins  has been shown to induce the expression of several stress genes related to salt tolerance, dehydration, and cold stress  <cit> . ghmads <dig> exhibited higher expression levels in the two cotton genotypes upon  <dig> and 24 h of salt treatment. although ghmads <dig> is a well-known participant in cotton fiber elongation, salt-stress response is a novel function for this tf; alternative splicing may have altered its cellular role  <cit> .

although  <dig> “osmotic stress”-specific tf unigenes were observed after 4 h of stress treatment, most of the  <dig> “salt stress”-specific tf unigenes appeared to be ion-specific at 24 h . these two salt-stress treatment phases clearly triggered very different responses in the two contrasting genotypes. another finding of our study was that  <dig> unigenes belonging to the ap2/erebp family of tfs were also related to salt tolerance. dreb/cbf subfamily genes, such as dreb2a
 <cit>  and dreb2b
 <cit> , are reportedly involved in osmotic  and ionic  stress. interestingly, we also found that some type-b arrs  were induced or repressed at 4- and 24-h time points . these general salt-responsive genes identified at 4 h  are thus similar to those identified at 24 h . because those unigenes were expressed in both tolerant and sensitive genotypes, they may not be directly responsible for salt tolerance.

salt-responsive tf unigenes in the salt-tolerant cotton genotype
we detected  <dig> unigenes— <dig> at 4 h,  <dig> at 24 h, and  <dig> at both time points —that were differentially expressed under nacl treatment in the salt-tolerant genotype but not in the salt-sensitive one. in addition, unigene expression in the tolerant line earlistaple  <dig> differed dramatically between 24- vs. 4-h salt stress . one possible explanation for this temporal variation is that the expression of upstream response genes  was gradually reduced during osmotic stress recovery, with the upstream cascade genes then activated during ionic stress. other putative tfs related to salt tolerance that were identified in this study included ap2-erebp, myb, c2c2-dof, bzip, and bhlh . previous research has also demonstrated that some differentially expressed tf genes are associated with plant salt tolerance, including ghhb2
 <cit> , ghdreb1a
 <cit> , atc3h29
 <cit> , atpp2c66
 <cit> , and osc3h33
 <cit> . the discovery in this study of many tfs in various families indicates that a complicated transcriptional regulation network is involved in response to high salinity in cotton.

differentially expressed regulators and functional unigenes in tolerant and sensitive genotypes under salt stress
when a plant experiences sudden salt stress, salinity perception occurs via ionic and osmotic stress signaling. these signals are first sensed by receptors present on plant cell membranes, with a large number of cell-membrane transport pathways, including ion channels and ion carriers, also participating in this signal transduction. many of these receptors and transporters have been characterized at the gene level, revealing that the uptake and distribution of particular ions may involve some of the genes and gene families identified in our study . plant cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels  are mainly involved in developmental processes, plant-pathogen interactions, and initiation of cytosolic ca2+-dependent signal transduction. in our study, ghcngc was identified and differentially expressed under 4- and 24-h salt stress in the salt-tolerant genotype. cngc <dig> has only limited involvement in long-term na+ uptake, as revealed by an earlier study that found that short-term uptake of na+ was greater in the cngc <dig> mutant relative to the wild type, but uncovered no significant differences in na+ content after prolonged periods  <cit> . several other key abc transporter and h+-transporting atpase genes, such as abcb <dig>  abcc <dig>  abcg <dig>  aha <dig>  aha <dig>  and vamp <dig>  were significantly up-regulated at  <dig> and/or 24 h of salt treatment. extracellular stress signals are first perceived by membrane receptors, which then activate a large and complex intracellular signaling cascade that includes the generation of second messengers such as ca2+. this increased cytosolic ca2+ initiates the stress signaling pathways required for stress tolerance  <cit> .figure  <dig>

cdpk, sos, and mapk pathways are important signaling pathways associated with salt stress response  <cit> . cams/cmls, cdpks, and cipks represent the three major classes of plant ca2+ sensors that are involved in many developmental and stress-induced signal transduction pathways  <cit> . in the present study, cdpks  were mainly up-regulated at  <dig> and 24 h in the salt-tolerant genotype, with their expression remaining at low levels over 24 h of salt stress in the salt-sensitive genotype. we also found that a cpk <dig> gene, homologous to ptcpk <dig>  was up-regulated at  <dig> and 24 h. ghcdpk <dig>  homologous to atcpk <dig>  was identified and exhibited peak expression at 24 h of treatment . atcpk <dig> overexpression has been reported to affect the expression of several abf4-regulated genes and to be involved in aba/salt-stress response  <cit> . furthermore, a ghcpk <dig> gene was cloned and found to be responsive to salt tolerance  <cit> . overexpression of oscpk <dig> and atcpk <dig> enhances tolerance to cold and to salinity and drought  <cit> . the observed up-regulation of mekk1-mpk4/ <dig> at  <dig> and 24 h of salt treatment indicates that the mapk signaling pathway mediates salt-stress signaling in cotton . in addition, ghmpk <dig> was up-regulated under salinity at two time points in the salt-tolerant genotype, while its expression remained unchanged in the salt-sensitive genotype. ghcat <dig> was also over-expressed both at  <dig> and 24 h in the salt-tolerant genotype . the genes in the mapk signaling pathway likely exist in cotton as well. the role of the mekk1-mkk2-mpk4/mpk <dig> cascade in cold- and salt-stress signaling has been demonstrated in arabidopsis  <cit> . luo et al.  <cit>  have suggested that ghmpk <dig> plays a major role in aba-induced cat <dig> expression and h2o <dig> production. although ghmpk <dig> has an important function in salicylic acid -regulated broad-spectrum resistance to pathogen infection  <cit> , it was a novel mapk involved in salt-stress response. the expression of genes involved in mapk and ca2+ signaling pathways, along with other kinases, at various time points under salt stress suggests that the induction of signaling pathways can activate responsive targets for adaptation to salt stress in cotton.

plant hormones such as aba, ethylene , sa, and jasmonate  are essential for plant adaptation to abiotic stress conditions  <cit> . in our study, cotton unigenes associated with aba and et signaling pathways showed differential expression at different time points under salt stress . four genes homologous to atnced <dig>  athva22a, athva22e, and atedl <dig>  which are related to aba synthesis or regulation, were up-regulated after  <dig> and 24 h of salt treatment in the salt-tolerant line. up-regulation of plc <dig>  abi1/ <dig>  and hab1/ <dig> at  <dig> and 24 h, plc <dig> at 4 h, and plc <dig> at 24 h in the salt-tolerant genotype implied that aba signaling pathway induction occurred under salt stress . as one of the main plant hormones, aba regulates numerous developmental processes and adaptive stress responses in plants. recent studies have shown that 9-cisepoxycarotenoid dioxygenase  is the key enzyme involved in aba biosynthesis  <cit> . athva <dig> is differentially regulated by aba, cold, dehydration, and salt stresses  <cit> . in a. thaliana, strong and rapid induction of the edl <dig> gene has been observed under osmotic stress and high salinity  <cit> . phospholipase c  and protein phosphatase 2c  are involved in the aba signaling pathway  <cit> . during salt stress , genes related to et biosynthesis  were also up-regulated. et receptor , et signaling pathway , and feedback mechanism  genes were also up-regulated at 4- and/or 24-h time points . et regulates stress and defense responses along with many key events of plant growth and development. it binds to membrane protein receptors  and activates the mapk cascade  which, in turn, stabilizes the ein <dig> protein. ein <dig> activates the expression of erf <dig> involved in secondary transcription in the signaling pathway, while ctr <dig>  acts as a negative regulator and degrades ein <dig>  <cit> . in our study, only atmpk <dig> was detected. we suspect that additional genes exist that were undetected. an earlier study also revealed that et is involved in drought-stress tolerance as well as cotton fiber development  <cit> . our results suggest the occurrence of multiple-hormone cross-talk in response to osmotic and salt stresses at different time points.

some salt-responsive downstream genes, especially those involved in antioxidant system and transport functions , may also provide a well-characterized clue to understanding the mechanisms responsible for salt tolerance. under salt stress, several transporters of toxic metal ions, lipids, water, and sugar molecules were differentially expressed, such as abc transporters, h+-atpase, sucrose transport, inositol transporter, gated channel, sulfate transporter, nhx <dig>  h+ antiporter, chloride channel, and potassium channel proteins. another aspect of salt tolerance is the regulation of ros to protect membranes and macromolecules. in our study, several genes related to detoxification were up-regulated at various time points under salt stress. these expressed genes were homologous to aomi, aldh, nmt <dig>  ann <dig>  ala <dig>  aap <dig>  vakp <dig>  pod, cat, rboh, gr/gpx, and gst
.

mediation of a potential regulatory network via conserved mirnas in the g. hirsutumsalt-tolerant genotype
over the past few years, mirnas have been reported to be prominent gene regulatory factors in plant tolerance to environmental stresses such as drought, cold, heat, and high salinity  <cit> . much effort has been devoted to understanding their role in salt-stress responses of various plants including zea mays
 <cit> , populus euphratica
 <cit> , gossypium hirsutum
 <cit> , and thellungiella salsuginea
 <cit> .

in our study, salt-responsive mirnas were detected in both cotton genotypes. a majority of the responsive mirnas were either detected only in the salt-tolerant genotype or had distinct and inverse expression trends at 4- or 24-h time points between the two cotton genotypes . this dichotomy suggests that common-regulated mirnas may be part of the fundamental mechanism of salt-stress adaptation, while differentially expressed mirnas are responsible for the distinct salt sensitivities between the two cotton genotypes . our results are consistent with a previous hypothesis that highly expressed mirnas are primarily responsible for control of basic cellular and developmental pathways common to most eukaryotes, whereas lower-expressed mirnas are involved in regulation of lineage-specific pathways and functions  <cit> .

because mirnas regulate the specific genes targeting mrnas for degradation or translation inhibition, identification of the potential target unigenes of mirnas is crucially important for understanding mirna-mediated processes such as salt tolerance in plants. according to the pcc and linear regression analysis, the candidate negative correlation mirna/target genes were further analyzed . it is noted that there is four clumps along the x-axis obviously: mirna strongly down, slightly down, slightly up, and very strongly up . since some mirnas were strongly repressed in salt stress than that in control condition,and some mirnas were strongly inducted in salt stress compared with that in control condition, the log <dig> and log <dig>  value of some mirnas in different treatment were more than  <dig> or less than - <dig>  these mirnas may be play an important role in response to salt stress. the identified differentially expressed mirnas which their log <dig>  and log <dig>  value range of -2 ~ - <dig> and 1 ~  <dig> can regard as slightly down and slightly up-regulated mirnas. therefore, the data points are separated into four clumps along the x-axis. there is no doubt that all these candidate negative correlation mirna/target genes should be emphasized. here, we found that the differentially expressed, conserved mirna targets of salt-tolerant earlistaple  <dig> generally encoded tfs, enzymes, and stress response, transport, and signal transduction proteins .

many mirna target genes encode mrnas of tfs, indicating upstream regulation of mirnas during developmental processes and environmental responses  <cit> . some mirnas, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  exhibited altered expression profiles in at least one genotype in our study. based on transcriptome data prediction results, they regulate the expression of tfs . in this study, three mir156s  and one mir <dig>  were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, under 24-h salt treatment in the tolerant line earlistaple  <dig>  in addition, three of the above mirnas may function by changing normal levels of downstream gene transcripts through modulation of spl <dig> and rap2- <dig> expression . mir <dig> and mir <dig> are also involved in the regulation of flowering time and floral development in arabidopsis, which they accomplish by negatively regulating sbp-like proteins  and ap2-like factors, respectively  <cit> . these results suggest that the three conserved mirnas may play significant regulatory roles in shoot maturation and the vegetative- to reproductive-phase transition. the nac family is involved in embryo and shoot meristem development, lateral root formation, auxin signaling, and defense and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . the conserved mirna ptc-mir164f, which was verified by stem-loop rt-pcr to target the nac domain-containing protein , was highly down-regulated at  <dig> and 24 h of salt stress in earlistaple  <dig> . we observed that the cup-shaped cotyledon  <dig> gene , which is targeted and negatively regulated by at-mir164a, was especially down-regulated only at 24 h in earlistaple  <dig> . this result suggests that the different mirna164s may negatively regulate different nacs during at the early stage of salt stress of salt stress. the no apical meristem  protein is involved in plant hormonal control and defense  <cit> . in arabidopsis, atnac1-overexpressing lines are bigger than the wild type, with larger leaves, thicker stems, and more abundant roots  <cit> , suggesting that nac <dig> may be an early auxin-responsive gene. cup-shaped cotyledon  <dig>  and at-mir164a are transcribed in overlapping domains at the margins of young leaf primordia, with transcription gradually restricted to the sinus where the arabidopsis leaf margins become serrated  <cit> . most often, the regulatory pathway consisting of mir <dig> that targets tir <dig>  a negative regulator in auxin signaling, may participate in lateral root development in arabidopsis  <cit> . the other target was a bhlh transcription factor, which was involved in many biological processes, but there were no phenotypic changes and functional mechanisms owing to mir393/bhlh interaction in arabidopsis  <cit> . in our study, all mir393s , which were highly expressed at  <dig> and 24 h of salt stress in salt-tolerant earlistaple  <dig> but were unaffected or down-regulated in salt-sensitive nan dan ba di da hua, targeted and tested as negatively related to a bhlh <dig> homolog unigene  by stem-loop rt-pcr . induction of mir <dig> at the early stage of salt stress  suppressed the expression of its target atbhlh <dig> in our proposed mirna-mediated regulatory network based on mirna-tf interactions , one mirna may regulated more than one tf gene. in addition, differentially expressed conserved mirnas may also target non-tf genes. comparison of target genes of conserved mirnas illustrated in the regulatory network suggests that the same mirna response to salt stress at different time points may regulate the same or different genes to exert different functions. nevertheless, these putative interactions need to be confirmed by experimental data.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we first generated a global transcription map of genes and mirnas expressed in leaves of salt-tolerant cotton under salt stress. we detected  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes exhibiting differential co-expression after  <dig> and 24 h of salt stress, respectively. go annotations demonstrated that unigenes belonging to a wide range of functional categories are involved in salinity defense response at the two different time points. we also identified  <dig> mirnas conserved across the two genotypes. of these,  <dig> members of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> families were differentially expressed at  <dig> and 24 h under salt stress in the salt-tolerant genotype. some mirna targets were predicted to encode abiotic stress-responsive tfs and enzymes. expressions of some selected differentially regulated mirnas and their targets were found to be negatively regulated. comparative transcriptome analysis of salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive genotypes indicated that essential salt tolerance-related genes and mirnas were differentially expressed and were only weakly or non-responsive to salt stress in the salt-sensitive cotton. finally, we have provided a list of salt tolerance-related genes that will facilitate candidate gene discovery and molecular marker development for salt-tolerant breeding in cotton.
