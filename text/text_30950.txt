BACKGROUND
metabolic syndrome  is a multi-component disorder characterized by abdominal obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and impaired insulin sensitivity, and it is associated with an increased risk of type  <dig> diabetes  and cardiovascular diseases   <cit> . the etiology of mets is the result of a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors, including dietary habits, particularly the quality of dietary lipids  <cit> .

mets is also associated to a low-grade inflammation, which links mets patients with atherosclerosis risk development  <cit> . additionally, mets patients have increased oxidative stress, which is directly related to the inflammatory process  <cit> . reactive oxygen species  also trigger alterations in biomolecules such as lipids, proteins and dna, which in turn, activate cellular systems to repair the proteins and dna  <cit> .

diet, and particularly dietary lipids, has been shown to modulate these processes  <cit> . in fact, monounsaturated fatty acids -rich diets reduce nf-κb activation compared with butter- and walnut-enriched diets or western diets  <cit> , and reduce the pro-inflammatory and oxidative status . in addition, low-calorie  <cit>  and mufa-rich  <cit>  diets reduce oxidative stress. moreover, the consumption of saturated fatty acids has been shown to contribute to the development of mets by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α  and interleukin- <dig> via nf-kb activation  <cit> .

many studies use as an in vivo cellular model peripheral blood mononuclear cells , a subset of white blood cells consisting of lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages, which are easily isolated in humans from blood samples and frequently used to assess biological responses , including dietary intervention . most of them analyze gene expression, and while this is relevant, they have the intrinsic limitation of not focusing on the final products that perform the biological function. in fact, we have previously shown in a sub-group of the lipgene study  how an increased expression of antioxidant genes in pbmc seems to be due to the response to the postprandial oxidative stress generated mainly in adipose tissue after the consumption of an high-saturated fatty acid diet . we have also shown how the long-term consumption of a healthy diet model with high-monounsaturated fatty acid  attenuates the postprandial inflammatory state and oxidative stress associated with mets . these gene expression changes were supported by changes in the regulatory elements at protein levels, so it may be expected that the diet would cause changes in the proteome.

a proteomic approach using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  coupled with mass spectrometry protein identification is becoming widely used as a tool for monitoring changes in protein expression which may be associated to a specific disease or therapeutic response  <cit> , including dietary intervention  <cit> .

we recently described the changes undergone by the proteome after the intake of four different meals in terms of lipid quality  <cit> . although that study allowed us to identify fast-response proteins for dietary lipids which respond to an acute intake, it raised questions about the effect of the long-term consumption of dietary models differing in quantity and quality of lipids. thus, in this work, we aimed to assess the changes in the proteome of mets patients after 12 weeks’ consumption of the four dietary models, in order to identify the target proteins that are modulated in response to the quantity and quality of lipids.

pathway analysis
pathway analysis was performed by using the ingenuity pathway program, which allowed us to identify those metabolic pathways or possible biomechanisms that may be regulated in response to the long-term consumption of the four different diets. these biomechanisms can be grouped in  <dig> clusters of cellular functions:  movement, proliferation and migration of cells ,  cellular assembly and organization  regulation and metabolism ,  chaperones and stress response ,  cellular cycle ,  dna integrity ,  others .

our analysis also showed that the long-term consumption of the hsfa diet induced changes in proteins involved in five interaction networks , which are mainly related with the degradation of unfolding proteins , cell to cell signaling interaction , morphology and cardiovascular system development . analysis of the biofunctions related with diseases and disorders showed that these proteins are included in neurological  and infectious diseases  . top canonical pathway analysis showed the interaction of three nuclear proteins actb, arpc <dig> and vasp within the pathway fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages and monocytes .fig.  <dig> interaction between induced proteins at the long-term consumption of  hsfa and  hmufa diets. networks of differentially expressed proteins in the long-term ingestion of: a) hsfa, saturated fatty acid diet; b) hmufa, monounsaturated fatty acid diet



the long-term consumption of the hmufa diet induced changes in proteins involved in three different networks : developmental disorder , dna replication, recombination and repair  and inflammatory response . the molecular and cellular functions analysis included the proteins involved in mechanisms such as cell to cell signaling , cell function and maintenance , and cell death and survival . in terms of diseases and disorders, the biofunctions analysis showed two items at the level of hematological and immunological diseases, with five proteins inter-related . analysis of the canonical pathways indicates that the protein changes identified interact in pathways related with extrinsic and intrinsic prothrombin activation and the coagulation system .

long-term consumption of the lfhcc diet showed significant changes in the proteins interlinked in one main network , that includes six molecules related with organism function , tissue morphology, organism injury and abnormalities. analysis of the molecular and cellular functions suggests that these proteins are involved in the carbohydrate metabolism, cell to cell signaling  and cellular assembly and organization . our results showed that at the level of the biofunctions related with diseases and disorders, the changes induced by a chronic intake of the lfhcc diet are implicated in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases . the canonical pathway analysis shows that the changes identified are related with actin cytoskeleton signaling  .fig.  <dig> interaction between induced proteins at the long-term consumption of  lfhcc and  lfhcc n- <dig> diets. networks of differentially expressed proteins in the long-term ingestion of: a) lfhcc, low fat, high-complex carbohydrate diet with placebo; b) lfhcc n- <dig>  low fat, high-complex carbohydrate diet with  <dig>  g/d lc n- <dig> pufa diet



the lfhcc n- <dig> diet induced changes in the proteome of pbmc  related with the inflammatory response , cellular aggregation  and cellular assembly . analysis of the molecular and cellular functions shows that the proteins identified after the ingestion of this diet are involved in cellular assembly and organization  and cell death and survival . likewise, analysis of the diseases and disorders groups shows the proteins that are involved in immunological diseases and inflammatory response. canonical pathway analysis after the long-term intake of lfhcc n- <dig> shows changes in the extrinsic prothrombin activation pathway associated with the proteins differentially expressed .

discussion
our study showed for the first time the effect of the long term consumption of four dietary models, providing different quantity and quality of dietary lipids, on the whole proteome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells  from patients with mets. in this study, we analyzed separately the changes induced in the nuclear and cytoplasmic proteome after the long-term consumption of a high saturated fatty acid diet , a high monounsaturated fatty acids-rich diet , a low-fat high carbohydrates diet  and a low-fat high carbohydrates diet supplemented with n- <dig> fatty acids .

the proteins responding to the quantity and quality of dietary lipids identified in our study showed that dietary lipids regulate different biomechanisms directly involved in the etiology of mets. this idea is supported by the relationship found between mets parameters, mainly in changes in the tag and glucose levels and several changes in the proteome. long-term consumption of an hsfa diet leads to the increase of a protein involved in the degradation of ubiquitinilated proteins , and dna repair , both of which mechanisms are activated in response to the oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species . in contrast, hmufa, lfhcc and lfhcc n- <dig> diets showed a decrease in the expression of proteins directly related with oxidative stress, inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress  and dna repair.

in terms of cellular function, the  <dig> differentially expressed proteins after the consumption of the four diets , are mainly involved in four cellular processes:  movement, proliferation and migration,  cellular assembly and organization,  chaperones and oxidative stress response, and  dna integrity. similarly, these cellular mechanisms are related to four biological pathways: inflammation, oxidative stress, er stress and dna repair.

the long term consumption of the hsfa diet up-regulated chmp <dig>  and tom <dig> proteins, both involved in the protein degradation by the ubiquitination system in the er. while chmbp <dig>  is involved in the formation of multivesicular bodies   <cit> , tom <dig> binds ubiquitin, which suggests that these proteins may participate in the sorting of ubiquitinated proteins into mvb  <cit> . in addition, the up-regulation after an hsfa diet of polr3e, an oxidative stress-induced protein, is directly related with the dna repair process after oxidative damage  <cit> . moreover, a pro-inflammatory effect of hsfa consumption is suggested by the up-regulation of the vasodilatador-stimulated protein  and the down-regulation of arpc <dig> and actin, both involved in the control of migration and cellular aggregation characteristic of inflammatory processes . additionally, the up-regulation of the inflammatory-related nfx <dig> by hsfa consumption reinforces the idea that oxidative stress and inflammation are processes which are related to each other  <cit> .

in contrast, the long-term consumption of an hmufa diet down-regulated proteins involved in oxidative stress, and prothrombotic and pro-inflammatory proteins. in fact, there was a decrease in the expression of sortin-associated protein  <dig> , involved in the ubiquitination of damaged proteins by oxidative stress  <cit> , and polr3e, a protein involved in dna repair after oxidative damage  <cit> . these results suggests that the lower dna damage after the long-term consumption of an hmufa diet is presumably due to lower oxidative stress after the consumption of this diet, as previously described  <cit> . in keeping with this, a previous study by our group demonstrated in the same population as this study an imbalance in the cellular redox state or oxidative stress after an hsfa diet, with a reduction in oxidative stress after hmufa diet consumption  <cit> .

in addition, the consumption of the hmufa diet also down-regulated seven proteins involved in thrombus formation: prothrombin or coagulation factor ii , fibrinogen , alpha-fibrinogen precursor , talin <dig>  gelsolin , annexin <dig>  and capping protein  muscle z-line, beta , which is especially important in mets patients, as they are characterized by a pro-thrombotic state  <cit> . in fact, high fgb levels are associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease and the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction  <cit> , and tln <dig> participates in the establishment of focal cell to cell adhesions, which are characteristic in the pro-thrombotic and inflammatory process  <cit> . on the other hand, anx <dig> and the capping protein actin  are involved in the activation of macrophages , and gelsolin  in phagocytosis  <cit> .

both of the low-fat diets were characterized by a lower activation of the inflammatory pathway. the changes in the proteome observed after an hsfa diet support the idea of an increased production of reactive oxygen species, whereas changes in the proteome induced by hmufa reduced the risk of plaque formation of atheroma and reduced oxidative stress.

this is based on the down-regulation of tbk <dig>  thbs- <dig>  fgb, tpm <dig>  actb, and myo <dig> proteins after lfhcc consumption. tbk <dig> is a member of the iκb kinase  family and plays an important role in the regulation of the immune response  <cit> , thbs- <dig> has been shown to promote platelet aggregation  <cit> , and fibrinogen beta chain  protein, the substrate of the limiting step in the production of mature fibrinogen which is cleaved by thrombin to form insoluble fibrin, the most abundant component of blood clots  <cit> . proteins such as actin , myosin  and tropomyosin  interact to form the extracellular matrix and provide stability to the atherosclerotic plaque  <cit> .

moreover, the long-term consumption of both an lfhcc diet and the hmufa diet down-regulated the rev3l protein, which participates actively in the repair of dna damage and is induced by a variety of stimuli, including oxidative stress  <cit> . these results support the idea that the long-term consumption of an lfhcc diet reduces oxidative stress  <cit> , which may prevent dna damage by ros, as previously reported  <cit> . thus, the long-term consumption of lfhcc n- <dig> diet down-regulated proteins involved in cellular mechanisms such as oxidative stress, inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum function. recent studies have demonstrated that chloride intracellular channel  <dig>  has a binding site for glutathione  in its n-terminal domain and plays an important role in the generation of ros via the nadph-oxidase system, participating in the channel ion exchange required for the synthesis of ros  <cit> . moreover, the long-term consumption of an lfhcc n- <dig> diet also down-regulated s100-a <dig> protein, which forms a complex with annexin <dig>  a mediator of macrophage activation in the inflammatory response  <cit> . we also observed a down-regulation in macf <dig> protein after lfhcc n- <dig> diet consumption. this protein belongs to the family of plakins and plays a role in the cytoskeletal dynamic that is necessary for cell migration and chemotaxis, which are typical in mechanisms such as inflammation  <cit> . additionally, at er level, the up-regulation of bip, an er stress sensor protein  <cit> , and the down-regulation of hsp <dig>  a protein involved in the transport and folding of proteins in response to oxidative damage, suggest a modulation of er stress following the consumption of lfhcc n- <dig> 

one limitation of this study is that, although we are able to identify protein profile changes indicative of the modulations of the cvd risk factors associated with mets, further studies will be needed in order to work out how to categorize diets according to their efficiency as anti-inflammatory or antioxidant treatments, based on the changes induced on the whole proteome.

CONCLUSIONS
the long term consumption of hsfa, compared to hmufa, lfhcc and lfhcc n- <dig>  may increase the cvd risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome, such as inflammation and oxidative stress, in addition to the dna damage which is a consequence of high oxidative stress. the implications of this study for the general nutrition of the population, and specifically for mets patients, lie in the adaptive effect observed after the long-term consumption of four dietary models differing in the quantity and quality of dietary lipids.
