BACKGROUND
borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato , the etiologic agent of lyme borreliosis, is a genetically diverse species. the different genospecies of b. burgdorferi sl appear to be associated with different manifestations of the disease  <cit> . b. burgdorferi sensu stricto  is more common in north america but also found in eurasia and is associated with arthritis, while b. garinii and b. afzelii are only present in eurasia and are more commonly associated with lyme neuroborreliosis and cutaneous manifestations, respectively. specifically b. garinii ospa serotype  <dig>  strains, a genetically homogenous group, are frequently observed as a causative agent of neuroborreliosis in adults in europe  <cit> . recently it has also been proposed, though not yet generally accepted, to delineate the b. garinii st <dig> strains as a separate species, b. bavariensis, due to large differences compared to b. garinii non-st <dig> in multilocus sequence analysis  on several housekeeping genes  <cit> .

the different human pathogenic genospecies are associated with certain human serum resistance profiles; the majority of b. burgdorferi ss and b. afzelii strains are relatively resistant to human serum, while most b. garinii strains are highly sensitive to complement-mediated killing in vitro. among b. garinii, the st <dig> strains showed a similar resistant profile as b. burgdorferi ss and b. afzelii  <cit> .

b. burgdorferi sl has developed a variety of immune evasion strategies, among which the binding of two host-derived fluid-phase regulators of complement: factor h  and factor h-like protein  <dig> . cfh and fhl- <dig> the main immune regulators of the alternative pathway of complement activation, are structurally related proteins composed of several protein domains termed short consensus repeats   <cit> . cfh is a 150-kda glycoprotein composed of  <dig> scr domains. in contrast, fhl- <dig> is a 42-kda glycoprotein corresponding to a product of an alternatively spliced transcript of the cfh gene and consists of seven scrs. the seven n-terminally located scrs of both complement regulators are identical with the exception of four additional amino acids at the c-terminus of fhl- <dig>  <cit> . cfh and fhl- <dig> in the human host are responsible for preventing binding of factor b to c3b, supporting the dissociation of the c3bbb complex and acting as a cofactor for factor i-mediated cleavage of c3b, the central component of the three complement activation pathways  <cit> .

serum resistant borrelia acquire cfh and/or fhl- <dig> by direct interaction with outer surface proteins designated crasps   <cit> . previously, five different crasps have been described for b. burgdorferi ss and b. afzelii. the cfh and fhl- <dig> binding cspa protein is  encoded by cspa, a gene located on the lp <dig> plasmid. although the lp <dig> plasmid of b. burgdorferi and b. afzelii carries multiple genes encoding a number of paralogous proteins, also called the gbb <dig> orthologous family, only the cspa is capable of binding human cfh and fhl- <dig>  <cit> . cspa is upregulated by spirochetes during the tick-mammalian transmission stage and down regulated during persistent infection  <cit> . cspz is a distinct protein encoded by the cspz gene located on plasmid lp28- <dig> and is expressed at higher levels during the mammalian infection than in bacteria residing in ticks or during laboratory cultivation  <cit> . anti-cspz antibodies can be detected as early as two weeks post infection in mice infected by ticks  <cit> . cspz has been shown to bind other yet unknown proteins and therefore can have multiple functions  <cit> . the cfh-binding crasp proteins bbcrasp- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> belong to the ospe-related proteins  paralogous family and their respective genes are located on diverse cp <dig> prophage dna molecules  <cit> . erp proteins are expressed in tissues in the host during disseminated mammalian infection. erp proteins have also been shown to be able to bind to factor h related proteins- <dig>  and plasminogen  <cit> .

in contrast to b. burgdorferi ss and b. afzelii most b. garinii strains are unable to bind human complement regulators  <cit> . two cspa orthologs from b. garinii st <dig> zq <dig>  named bgcrasp-1α and bgcrasp-1β, have been shown to bind weakly to fhl- <dig> but not to human cfh  <cit> . little data is published on complement evasion strategies of human serum resistant strains of the b. garinii st <dig> strains. the gbb <dig> orthologous family of b. garinii st <dig> has not been studied before.

it has been elaborately shown which gbb <dig> ortholog from b. burgdorferi ss and b. afzelii can bind human cfh, but little is known about the function of the other orthologs. it has been described previously that cspa derived from b. burgdorferi ss interacts with human cfh; however none of the closely related protein of the gbb <dig> family, interacts with human cfh  <cit> . wallich et al characterised all gbb <dig> orthologous members of a b. afzelii and b. garinii strain wherein none of the remaining orthologs could bind human cfh/fhl- <dig>  <cit> . we hypothesise that orthologs from the gbb <dig> family have the ability to bind to cfh from several animal origins.

the aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism for complement evasion by b. garinii st <dig> strains and to isolate and functionally characterize the specific gbb <dig> orthologs binding to human cfh/fhl- <dig> and also to other mammalian and avian cfh. we could prove binding of  <dig> st <dig> gbb orthologs, bga <dig> and bga <dig>  to human fhl- <dig>  whereas bga <dig> also bound cfh. moreover, both these and other orthologs from the gbb <dig> family were also able to bind cfh from various animal species.

RESULTS
serum susceptibility testing of borrelial strains
to assess and to compare serum susceptibility of b. garinii pbi and vsbp as well as b. burgdorferi ss b <dig>  spirochetes were incubated for  <dig> h with either 50% nhs or 50% hi nhs. as shown in fig  <dig>  >75% of the cells of b. garinii st <dig> pbi and b. burgdorferi ss b <dig> survived in serum, indicating that both strains resist complement-mediated killing. in contrast, b. garinii non-st <dig> strain vsbp was highly sensitive to complement as 99% of the cells were immobilized and showed blebs after  <dig> hours. incubation of strains pbi, vsbp, and b <dig> with hi nhs resulted in no or very little immobilisation. summarising b. garinii st <dig> pbi and b. burgdorferi ss b <dig> are resistant to human serum when incubated with active human complement, while b. garinii non-st <dig> vsbp is not human serum resistant.

the detection of the membrane attack complex deposited on borrelial cells after complement activation
to test whether membrane attack complex  was formed on the surface of different strains after complement activation, spirochetes were incubated with 25% serum and deposition of the mac was detected by immuno-fluorescence microscopy  . the majority of the cells of b. garinii st <dig> pbi and b. burgdorferi ss b <dig> stained negative for the mac while all b. garinii non-st <dig> vsbp were fully covered with mac. this finding indicates that b. garinii st <dig> pbi and b. burgdorferi ss b <dig> allow formation of the mac on their bacterial surface only to a limited extent in comparison to b. garinii non-st <dig> strain vsbp.

detection of bound complement regulators to different borrelial strains
in order to elucidate the capability of serum resistant b. garinii st <dig> pbi to bind complement regulators cfh and fhl- <dig> to the surfaces in a non-denatured state, intact spirochetes were incubated with nhs which was supplemented with edta to prevent complement activation. complement regulators were allowed to adsorb to the borrelia surface and bound proteins were subsequently eluted with acidified  <dig>  m glycine. the wash and the eluate fraction were analyzed for the presence of cfh and fhl- <dig> by western blotting. as shown in fig  <dig>  fhl- <dig>  but not cfh could be detected in the eluate fraction indicating that b. garinii st <dig> pbi specifically interact with fhl- <dig> 

accessibility and surface exposure of cfh/fhl- <dig> binding proteins of b. garinii st <dig> pbi
in order to identify fhl- <dig> binding proteins produced by b. garinii st <dig> pbi and to determine whether these proteins are exposed to the extracellular space, spirochetes were treated with increasing concentrations of proteinase k or trypsin and proteolysis was detected by ligand affinity blotting. cell lysates obtained after protease treatment were separated by sds-page, transferred to nitrocellulose and the respective proteins were detected. as shown in fig  <dig>  four distinct binding proteins could be detected in untreated serum-resistant b. garinii st <dig> pbi. treatment with proteinase k at the lowest concentration resulted in the complete elimination of cfh/fhl- <dig> binding. upon treatment with trypsin, degradation was only achieved at a concentration of  <dig> μg/μl. as expected, the intracellular protein flagellin was resistant to trypsin and proteinase k treatment, even at the highest concentration. these data demonstrate that b. garinii st <dig> pbi produced up to four surface-exposed cfh/fhl- <dig> binding proteins, in the range of 19- <dig> kda. this is in concordance to the findings of mcdowell et al, where b. garinii st <dig> pbi expressed a  <dig>  and  <dig> kda protein that were found to interact with cfh  <cit> . the cspa orthologs tested in this study are in the range of 25- <dig> kda, the smaller proteins detected appear to belong to the erp protein family.

cloning and identification of the cfh/fhl- <dig> binding proteins of b. garinii st <dig> pbi
assuming that the genes encoding cfh/fhl- <dig> binding proteins of b. garinii st <dig> pbi share similarity to cspa encoding cspa gene of b. burgdorferi ss b <dig>  b. afzelii mms and b. garinii zq <dig>  a database search was conducted. four genes revealed a high degree of similarity with either cspa of b. burgdorferi ss b <dig>  b. afzelii mms or b. garinii zq <dig> as described previously  <cit> . bga <dig>  bga <dig>  bga <dig> and bga <dig> showed similarity to previously described cspa of about 50%. comparative sequence analysis, revealed that orthologs bga <dig> and bga <dig> were found to have the highest degree of similarity within the putative cfh/fhl- <dig> binding regions of cspa  <cit> . bga <dig>  bga <dig>  bga <dig> and bga  <dig> as well as cspa of b. burgdorferi ss strain b <dig> were cloned and expressed as gst fusion proteins.

determination of binding of cspa orthologs to cfh and fhl-1
binding of cfh and fhl- <dig> to non-denatured purified recombinant proteins was evaluated by ligand affinity blot. proteins were separated under denaturing conditions and subsequently blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. as shown in fig  <dig>  bbcspa used as positive control bound strongly to cfh and fhl- <dig> as described previously  <cit> . orthologs bga <dig> and bga <dig> were capable of binding to both complement regulators, however, with reduced intensities compared to cspa.

to further confirm binding of cspa orthologs an elisa was conducted. cspa orthologs bga <dig>  bga <dig>  bga <dig>  and bga <dig> were immobilized on a microtiter plate and binding of cfh and fhl- <dig> was evaluated . bbcrasp- <dig> used as a positive control strongly bound to cfh and fhl- <dig>  of the four cspa orthologs analyzed, bga <dig> was capable of binding to both complement regulators, this binding was significantly higher than the baseline . ortholog bga <dig> specifically bound to fhl- <dig>  but less efficiently than cspa and bga <dig>  in contrast, orthologs bga <dig> and bga <dig> were not able to bind to cfh or fhl- <dig> at all.

these data confirmed that orthologs bga <dig> as well as bga <dig> derived from b. garinii st <dig> pbi were capable of binding fhl- <dig>  binding of cfh in both assays is evident for bga <dig>  but not for bga <dig> 

mapping of the binding domains of cfh and fhl- <dig> to cspa orthologs
in order to map the binding regions of cfh and fhl- <dig> interacting with bga <dig> and bga <dig>  various deletion constructs of cfh and fhl- <dig> were used for ligand affinity assays . bga <dig> bound to full-length cfh and fhl- <dig>  but to none of the deletion constructs lacking scrs 5- <dig>  bga <dig> bound fhl- <dig> as well as deletion constructs scr1- <dig> and scr1- <dig>  thus, scr5- <dig> of both cfh and fhl- <dig> are required for binding to bga <dig> and bga <dig> 

expression of bga <dig> and bga <dig> by real-time rt-pcr
cdna prepared from in vitro cultured b. garinii st <dig> pbi were tested in a quantitative real time pcr. cultures repeated in sexplet demonstrated a mean expression of bga <dig> of  <dig> copies/ <dig> copies flab  and bga <dig>  <dig> copies/ <dig> copies flab . all spirochetes cultivated in vitro expressed bga <dig> and bga <dig> simultaneously.

analysis of cfh binding of different animal sera to cspa orthologs
a variety of sera obtained from different animals were used to analyse binding of cfh to cspa, bga <dig>  bga <dig>  bga <dig>  and bga <dig> by ligand affinity blotting. as shown in fig  <dig>  cspa orthologs displayed distinct capacity of binding to cfh from a wide variety of sera from different mammals and poultry. all orthologs exhibit binding of cfh from bovine, equine and canine serum with different intensities. bga <dig> and bga <dig> showed a weak binding capacity to murine cfh. in addition, bga <dig> but not cspa nor other orthologs bound to avian cfh. porcine and feline serum proteins did not bind any of the cspa orthologs of b. garinii st <dig> pbi while feline cfh appears to bind only to bbcspa.

discussion
we are the first to demonstrate that b. garinii st <dig> pbi is serum resistant and is able to acquire fhl- <dig> but not cfh from human serum. in addition, we identified two distinct cspa orthologs, bga <dig> and bga <dig> as potential ligands of complement regulators cfh and fhl- <dig>  these proteins were produced under in vitro conditions as demonstrated by real time pcr. finally, we demonstrated distinct binding capacities of cfh of different mammalian and avian origin to different cspa orthologs of serum resistant b. garinii st <dig> pbi.

in europe four human pathogenic genospecies are endemic. b. burgdorferi ss, b. afzelii, and b. spielmanii display a human serum resistant phenotype while b. garinii strains are often serum sensitive  <cit> . within the ospa typing scheme, b. garinii st <dig> strains represent a distinct branch as shown by random amplified polymorphic dna  analysis. on the basis of mlsa analysis it has recently been proposed, though not yet generally accepted, to delineate this subgroup in a separate species; b. bavariensis  <cit> . b. garinii st <dig> is remarkably often associated with dissemination to the cns  <cit> . in a previous study it was confirmed that b. garinii non-st <dig> strains, including strains isolated from csf, are sensitive to complement while b. garinii st <dig> strains were resistant to human complement  <cit> . in this report we confirm with an in vitro killing assay and if that b. garinii st <dig> is resistant to human complement killing and that it does not allow formation of mac on the spirochetal membrane.

it has been extensively shown that cspa fulfils a key role in complement resistance of b. burgdorferi ss  <cit> . in the present study, a comparative binding analysis was conducted to isolate and characterize cspa orthologs from the serum resistant, b. garinii st <dig> strain pbi. we hypothesised that binding of cfh and/or fhl- <dig> via cspa orthologs contributes to serum resistance of b. garinii st <dig> pbi. we identified orthologs bga <dig> and bga <dig> but not bga <dig> and bga <dig> as being potential ligands for fhl- <dig> and cfh. in vitro cultured spirochetes bound fhl- <dig> but not cfh on their surface. the affinity for fhl- <dig> appeared to be stronger than for cfh, it can be concluded that fhl- <dig> competes with cfh for the same binding site and thus cfh could not be detected in the cell binding assay. when employing elisa on recombinant proteins, bga <dig> bound both complement regulators while bga <dig> only bound fhl- <dig>  by ligand affinity blotting bga <dig> bound fhl- <dig> as well as cfh. a logical explanation for this phenomenon might be the denaturing conditions of the western blot, suggesting that native bga <dig> specifically interacts with fhl- <dig> only.

furthermore, it was previously shown that cspa forms homodimers and three regions of cspa have been implicated in formation of a functional binding site of cspa to cfh/fhl- <dig>  <cit> . previously it has been hypothesised that the c-terminal ykxxdxxxp motif is important in binding of cfh and fhl- <dig>  as well as the lysine residue at position  <dig> of cspa  <cit> . recently it was also shown that a leucine residue at position  <dig> within the proposed cfh binding region  <dig> as well as tyr <dig>  asp <dig> and leu <dig> within the proposed binding region  <dig> of cspa were important in binding of cfh and fhl- <dig>  <cit> . the c-terminus of all known human cfh/fhl- <dig> binding cspa and the b. garinii st <dig> gbb <dig> orthologs is shown in table  <dig>  comparative sequence analysis revealed that the c-terminus of bga <dig> and bga <dig> are highly homologous to the c-terminus of all known human cfh/fhl- <dig> binding cspa. ortholog bga <dig> contains the c-terminal motif as well as the leu <dig>  while bga <dig> contains the c-terminal motif but has a phenylalanine instead of a leucine residue at position  <dig>  positions  <dig> and  <dig> are unchanged in bga <dig> and bga <dig> both orthologs show substitutions at position 242; the asp <dig> in bga <dig> and bga <dig> is replaced by a glutamic acid and a threonine residue, respectively. a substitution of asp <dig> by a neutral alanine residue within cspa did not have a significant effect on binding, while the replacement of aspartic acid by tyrosine at this position influenced binding of fhl- <dig> and is associated with a loss of binding of cfh  <cit> . lack of binding of native bga <dig> to cfh is likely to be due to the non-synonymous mutation of aspartic acid by threonine, while bga <dig> can still bind both cfh and fhl- <dig> due to the synonymous mutation of aspartic acid to glutamic acid. it is likely that absence of cfh binding by bga <dig> might be a result of an effect of the mutation on protein folding and conformation. our finding that under denaturing conditions bga <dig> can bind cfh, but not under native folded conditions supports this hypothesis.

a number of gram-negative as well as gram-positive bacteria have already been shown to be able to bind cfh in order to protect themselves from complement-mediated lysis  <cit> . cfh possess three binding sites for complement c3b, however the only essential binding site is scr1- <dig>  <cit> . here we show that bga <dig> as well as bga <dig> bind scr5- <dig> of cfh and fhl- <dig>  thus leaving the n-terminus free for maintaining their regulatory activity in factor i-mediated inactivation of c3b  <cit> . our finding indicates that b. garinii st <dig> strains can bind functionally active cfh and fhl- <dig> on the membrane by bga <dig> and bga <dig> in order to evade complement activation.

b. burgdorferi sl has developed an intriguing system to respond to changes of the microenvironments by coordinated expression of proteins. in vitro experiments usually do not completely mirror the expression patterns of cspa during the tick to mammal infectious cycle and might also vary in cultured population  <cit> . cspa shows a distinct expression profile as it is mainly expressed during transmission of spirochetes from the tick-to-mammal and mammal-to-tick infection cycle  <cit> . previously antibodies to cspa could be detected in sera from infected mice and from lyme disease patients suggesting prolonged expression of cspa in the mammalian host  <cit> . in the present study we demonstrated that in vitro b. garinii st <dig> pbi is capable of expressing bga <dig> and bga <dig>  experiments regarding expression of bga <dig> and bga <dig> during tick-to-mammal transmission and mammalian infection are ongoing and will give more insight in their function in vivo.

although all five crasps of b. burgdorferi sl are primarily identified as ligands of human complement regulators, several studies clearly showed that cspa can also bind cfh from other mammalian hosts  <cit> . cfh binding of several animal cfh sources has also been reported in a recent article where new cfh binding proteins were identified  <cit> . it is still not quite clear how the wide variety of complement resistance is obtained in strains that do not interact with human cfh. the b. burgdorferi ss and b. afzelii orthologs of cspa were previously not studied for binding to cfh of non-human origin. in this study all cspa orthologs of b. garinii st <dig> pbi were tested with whole sera from different animals. bga <dig> and bga <dig> lack binding to human cfh but were able to interact with cfh from other hosts, of which some are not competent reservoir hosts for borrelia. it is likely that several members of the gbb <dig> paralogous family are designated to bind cfh from other species in the infectious cycle and are therefore not redundant but essential for infection of a wide range of hosts. the interaction of mammalian cfh with cspa orthologs of b. burgdorferi sl might unveil a part of the serum resistance patterns obtained from in vitro experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we demonstrated b. garinii st <dig> pbi is able to evade complement killing and it can bind fhl- <dig> to membrane expressed proteins. recombinant proteins bga <dig> can bind fhl- <dig> and human cfh, while bga <dig> can bind only fhl- <dig>  all recombinant cspa orthologs from pbi can bind cfh from different animal origins. this can partly explain the wide variety of animals that b. garinii can infect.
