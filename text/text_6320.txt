BACKGROUND
whiteflies  are important pests of agriculture that feed on and transmit viruses to a wide range of crops. the two most damaging and widespread species are the tobacco or cotton whitefly  and the greenhouse whitefly .

one factor enhancing the pest status of whiteflies is their ability to evolve resistance to insecticides. both b. tabaci and t. vaporariorum are known to exhibit resistance to several insecticide groups including the neonicotinoids, the most widely-used compounds for whitefly control  <cit> . insecticide resistance commonly arises through two main mechanisms 1) reduced binding of the insecticide to its target through target site mutation  <cit>   and 2) enhanced metabolism or sequestration of insecticide by enzymes such as carboxyl-cholinesterases , glutathione-s-transferases  and cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases  <cit> .

cces, gsts and p450s are encoded by large and diverse gene families that are difficult to fully characterise by traditional biochemical methods. identification and cloning of genes encoding insecticide target sites composed of multiple subunit proteins  by degenerate pcr is also a lengthy and sometimes difficult process. the recent and rapid growth of the use of next generation sequencing has made it easier to study large complex genes or gene families such as insecticide target sites and those involved in detoxification of xenobiotics via the de novo sequencing of whole insect transcriptomes  <cit> . although there is a significant amount of genomic data for b. tabaci in this regard, including an expressed sequence tag  library  <cit>  and an ongoing genome project  <cit> , very little comparable data for t. vaporariorum exist, with only  <dig> nucleotide sequences currently available at ncbi.

cost-effective high-throughput dna sequencing technologies such as 454-based pyrosequencing of ests are a powerful new approach to characterise the transcriptome of insect species that lack a fully sequenced genome  <cit> . the amount of sequence information generated by these methods also facilitates the global analysis of gene expression by providing a reference transcriptome for cdna microarray design and/or serial analysis of gene expression   <cit> . here, we have used 454-based pyrosequencing to generate a substantial est dataset of the t. vaporariorum transcriptome and then characterised genes encoding detoxification enzymes and insecticide target proteins.

RESULTS
 <dig> pyrosequencing and assembly
over-abundant  <dig> - <dig> kb transcripts were reduced by normalisation of the whitefly cdnas and an even distribution of transcripts ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> kb in size was produced.  <dig> pyrosequencing of two libraries  resulted in a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads. after quality scoring of the reads,  <dig>  high-quality reads with an average length of  <dig> bp were entered to assembly . one pooled assembly was done incorporating both libraries , which resulted in  <dig>  contigs with an average length of  <dig> bp .  <dig> %  of these had an orf  ≥ <dig> bp, with an average length of  <dig> bp. the characteristics of the assembled t. vaporariorum  <dig> contigs and blastx alignments against the drosophila melanogaster uniprot database are shown in additional file  <dig>  figure  <dig> demonstrates that contigs that were assembled from up to  <dig> reads displayed a linear relationship between sequence read number and contig length .

homology searches, gene ontology and protein classification
approximately 37%  of the contigs returned an above cut-off blast hit to the ncbi nr database  . the average read length of these contigs was  <dig>  bp and e-value and sequence similarity distributions are detailed in additional file  <dig>  as expected, the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum harris  is the species that returned the most blast hits  with the t. vaporariorum contigs , since this species' genome was recently fully sequenced  <cit>  and currently represents the vast majority of hemipteran sequences available in genbank.

the remaining  <dig>  contigs that did not return a significant blast result against the ncbi nr database, had an average read length of  <dig> bp. more than 36% of those contigs  were found to have an orf ≥ <dig> bp, with an average length of  <dig> bp. 28% of these contigs  returned an interpro result and  <dig> %  returned a go term . these results give some indication of the limitation of blast comparison as a tool for inferring the relevant biological function of tentative unique genes assembled from sequencing data for species with very limited existing transcriptomic information. however, it is likely that the rapid expansion in sequence data from ongoing small and large scale insect sequencing projects will facilitate the future annotation of these genes.

go terms were used for the classification of the functions of the predicted whitefly proteins, producing  <dig>  terms for biological process categories,  <dig>  for molecular function categories, and  <dig>  for cellular component categories. enzyme classification shows that hydrolases account for the largest proportion of t. vaporariorum enzymes , followed by transferases  and oxidoreductases  . most of the molecular function go terms  were involved in binding  followed by catalytic activity . metabolic and cellular processes were involved with more than a half of the biological process go terms . the overall distribution suggests that the sequencing provided a comprehensive representation of the t. vaporariorum transcriptome and that  <dig> pyrosequencing of ests can achieve a great number and depth of sequence contigs.

transcripts encoding genes involved in insecticide detoxification
trialeurodes vaporariorum, like most insect species, metabolises xenobiotics such as secondary plant chemicals and insecticides using a suite of detoxification enzymes such as p450s, gsts and cces. representatives of all three enzyme families were identified in the t. vaporariorum transcriptome and the average sequence length and coverage obtained for members of these gene families using one full plate of  <dig> sequencing was comprehensive . table  <dig> reveals that the average orf length of each of these gene families obtained for t. vaporariorum was more than 84% of that of the same gene families in the fully-annotated genome of a. pisum. candidate contigs were manually curated to identify allelic variants of the same gene or those with a high number of sequencing errors. most contigs were assembled from at least  <dig> sequencing reads and were identified in both t. vaporariorum libraries . the only exception was contig  <dig>  which was assembled from  <dig> reads from only the imidacloprid resistant strain  library and had a protein motif of a cce.

transcripts encoding putative p450s
a total of  <dig> p <dig> related contigs were identified in the transcriptome. of these,  <dig> were manually curated  as the remainder were found to be either allelic variants of the same p <dig> gene or contained too many sequencing errors. these  <dig> p <dig> sequences were named by dr david nelson in accordance with the p <dig> nomenclature committee convention   <cit>  and  <dig> of them were found to represent full length orfs. based on the closest blast hits in the ncbi nr database, and when possible, by phylogenetic analyses with other known insect p <dig> genes, p450s were assigned to appropriate cyp clades and families. representatives of all  <dig> major insect cyp clades  were found in this dataset . a majority of identified p450s belonged to the cyp <dig> family ,  <dig> to the cyp <dig> family, and the rest to the cyp <dig> and mitochondrial families  . phylogenetic analysis of the t. vaporariorum p450s with those of a. pisum  revealed significant divergence in this gene family between these two species with only a few putative a. pisum orthologues identified . two sequences were considered orthologues if they were paired in the phylogeny with bootstrap support greater than 50%. duplication events specific to t. vaporariorum are also apparent from the phylogeny, with the best example being the three cyp4-type sequences cyp4g <dig>  cyp4g <dig> and cyp4g <dig>  the potential role of these duplication events in insecticide resistance warrants further investigation as amplification of a p <dig> gene has recently been implicated in insecticide resistance in myzus persicae sulzer   <cit> .

cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> p <dig> families in other insect species are implicated in the metabolism of plant secondary metabolites and synthetic insecticides  <cit> . in the other hemipterans b. tabaci and m. persicae, over-expression of cytochrome p450s  contribute to resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides  <cit> . the closest hits of these two p450s in t. vaporariorum are cyp6cm <dig>  cyp6cm <dig>  and cyp6dp <dig>  cyp6dz <dig> . these genes and the other cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> p <dig> genes identified in this study are candidates for a potential role in neonicotinoid resistance in t. vaporariorum.

although the number of p450s in the t. vaporariorum transcriptome  is within the range of p450s identified in other insect species   <cit> , additional p <dig> genes may await discovery due to their absence from the current transcriptomic dataset. analysis of fully sequenced insect genomes have identified  <dig> p450s in aedes aegypti linnaeus ,  <dig> in anopheles gambiae giles ,  <dig> in drosophila melanogaster meigen ,  <dig> in the green peach aphid m. persicae,  <dig> in the green pea aphid a. pisum, and  <dig> in the western honey bee apis mellifera linnaeus   <cit> . the current number of  <dig> p450s in t. vaporariorum is at the lower end of this range, almost half of that for m. persicae.

transcripts encoding putative cces
a total of  <dig> contig sequences with a protein motif of a cce were identified. of these,  <dig> were manually curated  as some of the original sequences were found to be either allelic variants of the same cce gene or contained too many sequencing errors, and  <dig> were found to be full length. based on the closest blast hits in the ncbi nr database and when possible by phylogenetic analyses with other known cce genes from other insect species, these enzymes were assigned to three known classes of cces . known cces can be divided into  <dig> clades, nine of which are represented in t. vaporariorum. clades without identifiable t. vaporariorum homologues are clade b , integument esterases  and lepidopteran juvenile hormone esterase . esterases involved in the detoxification of insecticides belong to clades a-c and  <dig> sequences were assigned to these clades. a phylogenetic analysis indicates a potential expansion of t. vaporariorum cces in clade a . there is also evidence of a contraction in clade e, which contains the vast majority of aphid cces, although it is difficult to ascertain if genes in this clade have been lost from the genome or simply remain to be discovered . in addition, divergence in the cces of a. pisum and t. vaporariorum is apparent in the same clades . the potential a. pisum and b. tabaci orthologues of t. vaporariorum cces are detailed in additional file  <dig> 

clade a contains the largest number of identified t. vaporariorum cces , twice as many as in two other hemipteran species a. pisum and m. persicae   <cit> . of these, one cce sequence  had a high homology to a carboxylesterase gene in b. tabaci , which is over-expressed in organophosphate-resistant strains  <cit>  and another  was identified only in the imidacloprid resistant tv <dig> library and is therefore a candidate gene for a potential role in the neonicotinoid resistance of this strain. one identified sequence  had high homology to lepidoptera-specific alpha esterase . six sequences had homology to beta esterase  and two contigs were identified as acetylcholinesterases , which are the targets for organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. one of these, contig  <dig>  corresponds to a known ache sequence of t. vaporariorum . finally, other clades with identified t. vaporariorum homologues are glutactin , gliotactin , neuroligin , neurotactin  and an uncharacterised group .

transcripts encoding putative gsts
a total of  <dig> gst-related contig sequences were identified,  <dig> of which were unique and manually curated , and thirteen of these were full length. based on the closest blast hits in the ncbi nr database and when possible by phylogenetic analysis these contigs were assigned to the delta, epsilon, omega, sigma, theta, zeta, and microsomal classes . phylogenetic comparison of a. pisum and t. vaporariorum gsts revealed significant divergence in this gene family between the two species . most of the identified gsts were assigned to the delta class , members of which are known to play a role in insecticide detoxification in other insect species  <cit> . the number of delta class gsts in t. vaporariorum  is close to that in a. pisum where  <dig> sequences were identified  <cit> . although the epsilon and zeta classes are absent in a. pisum and m. persicae  <cit> , two contigs  were identified in t. vaporariorum. one contig, namely tv <dig>  was found to encode a microsomal gst.

detection of gene sequences encoding insecticide targets
a number of contigs encoding insecticide target proteins were identified in the t. vaporariorum transcriptome. these include the acetylcholinesterase enzyme , nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits , the acetyl-coa carboxylase , the voltage-gated sodium channel , the γ-aminobutyric acid  receptor, the glutamate-gated chloride channel  and the ryanodine receptor  . all contigs that were assembled from more than  <dig> reads and the vast majority of the contigs with lower coverage were identified in both t. vaporariorum libraries . although many of these contigs are not full length, they will nevertheless facilitate further characterisation of these targets by pcr and/or race. as the two cdna libraries were tagged prior to sequencing, we investigated the occurrence of snps in contigs encoding insecticide target-sites between the resistant and susceptible t. vaporariorum strains. a limited number of non-synonymous snps were observed between the two strains and these are listed in additional file  <dig>  a number of, often highly conserved, mutations have been described in many of these target proteins that lead to varying degrees of insensitivity such as mutations within the active-site gorge of the ache enzyme  <cit> , in domains ii or iii of the vgsc  <cit> , in the pore lining m <dig> region of the gaba receptor  <cit>  and within two alpha subunits of the nachr  <cit> . where possible we examined the two t. vaporariorum libraries for previously described mutations at known 'hot-spots' in other arthropod species but none were observed. however, several non-synonymous mutations at alternative positions in many of the target site genes were found  and these clearly warrant further investigation. pyrosequencing or taqman® assays can now be rapidly developed and used to screen additional whitefly populations with different resistance phenotypes to determine the consistency of the correlation of these snps with resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
t. vaporariorum is an important agricultural pest that has developed resistance to several insecticides used for whitefly control. to date, the lack of genomics data available for this species has hampered characterisation of the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance. the ~ <dig>  non-redundant est contigs described in this study represent a dramatic expansion of existing cdna sequence available for t. vaporariorum. we have identified the genes and gene families that are potential candidates for conferring insecticide resistance in t. vaporariorum including those encoding enzymes putatively involved in metabolic detoxification of xenobiotics and those encoding the target proteins of the major chemical classes of insecticides. the est contig library developed in this study can be used as a reference transcriptome for analysis of gene expression using cdna microarray and/or sage. we plan to use these genomic resources to investigate the role of detoxifying enzymes and target-site modification in t. vaporariorum populations that are resistant to insecticides. however, more broadly the annotated est library will facilitate the investigation of the fundamental biology of t. vaporariorum and its interactions with host plants. t. vaporariorum has a similar biology to b. tabaci, offering the prospect of sharing information on resistance mechanisms and other biological traits between these major crop pests.
