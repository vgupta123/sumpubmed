BACKGROUND
every year, 20–40% of the world’s crop production is lost to pests, weeds and diseases  <cit>  and about $ <dig> is spent annually to combat these insects. commonly used inorganic pesticides in agriculture have raised environmental and health concerns as these tend to persist in the environment for a long duration and thus continue to pose severe health hazards. the synthetic chemicals are non-biodegradable and highly toxic in nature and therefore 98% and 95% of the insecticides and herbicides respectively, are supposed to contribute to soil, water, and air pollution . as a result biological species are continuously exposed to these hazardous surroundings. to address such problems, efforts have been made to look for alternative approaches for more eco-friendly means of controlling pests and insects including use of naturally occurring pyrethrins. natural pyrethrins, offer many benefits over these chemicals like low toxicity, rapidity of action, active against a broad spectrum of insects, low costs, insect repellent, and no insect immunity. in addition, pyrethrins easily disintegrate in the air and sunlight, and are thus, considered as environmental friendly biodegradable compounds.

the t. cinerariifolium  aka pyrethrum, a perennial herb belonging to the family asteraceae is a remarkable plant. the plant is well known for its economic importance as a source of an important group of secondary metabolites known as pyrethrins, which is a potent insecticide  <cit> . pyrethrins are esters of either pyrethric acid or chrysanthemic acid with alcohol moiety termed as rethrolone  <cit> . pyrethrins are a set of six structurally similar compounds including pyrethrin i, cinerin i, jasmolin i  and pyrethrin ii, cinerin ii, jasmolin ii   <cit> . although pyrethrins occur throughout the aerial parts of the plant, the maximum accumulation of pyrethrin is concentrated in the flower heads, which is many folds higher than in leaves  <cit> . according to usda, pyrethrins and its synergists are considered as one of the safest and eco-friendly class of insecticides, which can be exploited at agro-industrial field levels  <cit> . natural pyrethrins are directly extracted from the plant source with potential application for insect vector control. pyrethrins are approved for such usage and also certified for use in organic gardening in the us  <cit> .

as a prelude to enhancing the production of pyrethrins through targeted breeding programs, better understanding of the expression network of the genes and pathways associated with pyrethrin biosynthesis is required. since the flowers and leaves differ substantially in the pyrethrin content, a facile insight could be obtained through comparing the transcriptome of the two organs of the plant. the next generation sequencing  approach of rna seq using the illumina platform has been widely adopted for transcriptome studies. however, to date, few full genome sequences are available in the asteraceae family. this is attributed to heterozygosity, high chromosome number and the ploidy level of the genus asteraceae where genome studies become more complicated  <cit> . yet, a number of expressed sequence tags  of various asteraceous species have been reported like gerbera hybrid, chicory  <cit> . these would serve as a good source of gene comparison when taken together with the information available from model-plant genome sequences.

although, there is considerable knowledge on the chemical structures and biochemistry of pyrethrins, the underlying molecular/biochemical mechanisms and the basis of variation in the bioactive constituents are still largely unknown. the percent content of pyrethrins in t. cinerariifolium flowers is governed by factors such as the plant genotype, ecological conditions and flower maturity  <cit> . earlier, the developmental gene/enzyme network in pyrethrin synthesis has been explored at the transcriptional level. in the present study the rnaseq-mediated transcriptome comparison of the t. cinerariifolium flowers and leaves was done, to obtain an insight into the genes involved in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins, not least because these genes are also involved in other secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways. based up on differential gene expression, the predicted candidate genes were found to be involved in pyrethrin/terpenes biosynthesis pathways. the unigenes and enzymes identified will lead to advancement in engineering of pyrethrin production in related species.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing, sequence quality control and de novo assembly
illumina  <dig> bp paired-end sequencing run representing the cdna library from leaf and flower tissue produced  <dig> , <dig> reads for flower  and  <dig> , <dig> reads for leaf  respectively. total reads encompassed nearly  <dig>  gb of sequencing data in fastaq format. sequence data was filtered to remove low quality reads and reads containing adapter sequences. after quality control a total of  <dig> , <dig> high quality sequencing reads for flower and  <dig> , <dig> for leaf tissues remained, which were assembled into  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique sequences  for flower and leaf tissues, respectively. the lengths of these unique sequences were sufficient to enable functional annotations with high accuracy. the reads obtained were assembled by using trinity software  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> strategy followed during the comparative analysis of leaf versus flower illumina transcriptome sequencing of tanacetum cinerariifolium, data analysis, and functional annotation

gene ontology and functional annotation
a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique sequences from the flower and leaf tissue were assigned with gene ontology  terms based on sequence similarity to proteins in tair database. the t. cinerariifolium transcripts were assigned for go terms to describe functions of genes and associated gene products into three, major categories namely; biological process, molecular function, and cellular component, and their sub-categories using plant specific go that broadly provides an overview of the ontology content of the genes related to the pyrethrin biosynthetic pathway. the molecular function, biological process, and cellular component categories included  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> unigenes, respectively which were assigned into  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> go terms, respectively .

in biological process group,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were assigned to metabolism, biosynthesis, nucleic acid metabolism and transport categories respectively. similarly,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were assigned to cellular component cellular protein intracellular and cytoplasmic components categories respectively. in molecular function category, a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were assigned to molecular activity, catalytic activity, transferase activity and hydrolase activity respectively . these go annotations provide a substantial information on potential functions of the transcripts identified in the t. cinerariifolium tissues. for the annotation and validation of the assembled unigenes, all the assembled unigenes were searched against the ncbi non-reduntant  and swissprot protein databases using blastx program with an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig> . a total of  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to different go category in leaf and flower tissues of t. cinerariifolium. out of these  <dig> unigenes belongs to flower and  <dig> unigenes are found in leaf tissue separately .fig.  <dig> histogram presentation of t. cinerariifolium unigenes among gene ontology functional classes. the results are categorized in three main categories: “cellular component”, “molecular function” and “biological process”. the left y-axis indicates the number of genes in particular category, and the left y-axis indicates the percentage of a specific category of genes in that main category

comparison of proteome of t. cinerariifolium with the proteome of other plant species
to further evaluate the quality of the sequenced data, the comparison of the differential proteome data of t. cinerariifolium leaf and flower tissue with the published proteome data of other plants viz; arabidopsis thaliana, sorghum bicolor, vitis vinifera, oryza sativa and solanum tuberosum was performed. total  <dig>  clustered transcripts  from flower were used for proteome comparison studies. out of these contigs of flower,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  showed a match with o. sativa, a. thaliana, s. tuberosum, v. vinifera and s. bicolor respectively. similarly, in leaf tissue  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contigs showed match with o. sativa, a. thaliana, s. tuberosum, v. vinifera and s. bicolor respectively. leaf tissue transcripts showed comparatively higher match with other plants. in both the tissues, maximum match was found with vitis vinifera protein .fig.  <dig> bar chart showing proteome wide comparison of pyt_f and pyt_l with other plants proteome




hplc analysis
high performance liquid chromatography was used to confirm the de novo biosynthesis of pyrethrin in flower verses leaf tissue of t. cinerariifolium. uv-visible absorption spectrum of flower and leaf extracts as well as of standard pyrethrin was recorded at  <dig> nm. the chromatograms of the standard pyrethrin and t. cinerariifolium  extracts recorded peaks corresponding to pyrethrin . all pyrethrin esters were separated well in the sequential order as cinerarin ii, pyrethrin ii, jasmolin ii and subsequently followed by cinerarin i, pyrethrin i, jasmolin i respectively.fig.  <dig> hplc analysis showing six different pyrethrin peaks corresponding different pyrethrin compounds. cinerin ii, pyrethrin ii, jasmoline ii and cinerin i, pyrethrin i, jasmoline i in  standard sample and  corresponding peaks in pyt_f and  showing chromatogram with less pyrethrin content in pyt_l respectively




metabolic pathway analysis through kegg database
in order to identify the biological pathways present in t. cinerariifolium, the assembled unigenes were annotated with corresponding enzyme commission  numbers through blastx  analysis, against the  kegg database  <cit> . pathway analysis helped us to understand the presence of biological function and interaction of genes. after assembly,  <dig>  unigenes in flower and  <dig>  unigenes in leaf were found to have match with kegg database and assigned to approximately  <dig> kegg pathways . these data provide a valuable resource in finding out unigenes involved in secondary metabolic pathways specially terpenoid biosynthetic pathway for pyrethrin biosynthesis .fig.  <dig> proposed terpenoid biosynthetic pathway. hmg co-a synthase ; hmg co-a reductase ; doxp reductoisomerase ; cdp –me synthase ; cdp-me kinase ; hmbpp reductase , cppase . the numerical number in red represent predominant enzymes in flower and green represents enzymes predominant in leaf




identification and quantification of up/down regulated transcripts involved in pyrethrin biosynthetic pathways
the pyrethrin belongs to monoterpenoid backbone and constitutes two moieties; acid and alcohol moiety. the formation of acid  moiety utilizes both methylerythritol 4-phosphate  as well as mevalonate  pathways, however, the formation of rethrolones utilize oxylipin pathway. in studied transcriptome data, most of the unigenes related to pyrethrin biosynthesis pathway were successfully identified with their respective gene ontology.

the identified  <dig> enzymes  in flower and  <dig> enzymes  in leaves involved in pyrethrin biosynthesis pathway. out of  <dig> unigenes, involved in mep pathway;  <dig> and  <dig> upregulated transcripts in the flowers and leaves respectively were assigned for the formation of acid moiety of pyrethrin. also  <dig> and  <dig> upregulated unigenes in flower and leaf respectively encoded enzymes involved in the oxylipin pathway, which forms the rethrolone moiety of the pyrethrin compound.

analysis of metabolic pathway genes which might be involved in pyrethrin biosynthesis
biosynthesis of pyrethrin constitutes three pathways involving mva, oxylipin pathway and mep pathway . total number of enzymes involved in mva was more in flower  as compared to leaf . there are two steps working in the mep pathway i.e. step 1; the number of enzymes in leaf  was higher than in flower . step  <dig> of mep pathway the number of enzymes in flower  was more than in leaf . the enzymes involved in the oxylipin pathway of leaf were found to be expressed more than two folds than in flower. this result indicates that the potential candidate genes for pyrethrin synthesis in mep and mva pathways were more expressed in flower than in leaf. although, the genes/enzymes involved in the synthesis of rethrolones were higher in leaf than in flower i.e.  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. in addition to this,  <dig> transcripts related to cyp <dig> were found to be expressed in leaves and  <dig> transcripts related to cyp <dig> with oxidoreductase activity were found to be expressed in flowers. the exact biosynthetic pathway involved in pyrethrin biosynthetic pathway in planta is not yet well known.

discussion
de novo assembly and functional annotation
despite a potentially major commercial value of the pyrethrins due to their utility as non-hazardous, eco-friendly pesticides and other pharmacological applications, the omics data on asteraceae family are very limited. some data is available in for chrysanthemum species such as c. morifolium  <cit> . ncbi genbank database contains  <dig>  ests from chrysanthemums. here, the transcriptome comparison between the flowers and leaves for deeper understanding of pyrethrin synthesis and content enhancement adds to de novo.


the de novo transcriptome annotation studies on some important medicinal plants such as the chinese fir  <cit> , maize, safflower  <cit> , ramie  <cit> , emerald notothen  <cit>  etc. in our study, total  <dig>  million reads for pytf  &  <dig>  million reads for pytl  samples were used to assemble the flower and leaf transcriptome of t. cinerariifolium. the data obtained provides nearly 100% of high quality bases for both the flower and leaf tissues which reflected the high quality sequence run. the de novo assembly was generated using trinity software  <cit> . the de novo assembly of t. cinerariifolium transcriptome was optimized after assessing the effect of various k-mer lengths. during the study, for assembly process, only those reads were considered that produced high frequency k-mer. in general, the longer the k-mer obtained, higher the proportionality to the accuracy of highly expressed transcripts in the genome. de novo longer k-mers are advantageous to distinguish repeats from real overlaps while shorter k-mers preferred for assembly of low expression genes  <cit> . further adapter sequences and low quality bases were trimmed. these results suggested that the transcriptome sequencing data of t. cinerariifolium were effectively assembled. the n <dig> and n <dig> values were higher which further suggests a better assembly.

unigenes were assessed for a role in the kegg database and were used to assign the functional go annotation including cellular components, molecular functions and biological component group. this facilitated assigning the relevant genes to the secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways. mapping these unigenes we found the involvement of many  in the biosynthesis of the pyrethrins either via universally present oxylipin or mep pathway.

identification of potential candidate genes involved in pyrethrin biosynthesis
pyrethrins are naturally occurred insecticides produced by certain species of chrysanthemum plants. pyrethrins are accumulated in flowers but they are also synthesized in plant leaves  <cit> . pyrethrins are esters containing a combination of either chrysanthemic acid or pyrethric acid moiety with rethrolones as alcohol moiety  . the acid moieties are monoterpenes having a cyclopropane ring and are biosynthesized via 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate , which is formed by the condensation of pyruvic acid and glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate in the presence of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose s-phosphate synthase  enzyme. the cyclopropane ring formation is catalysed by chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase  to give chrysanthemyl diphosphate using two molecules of dimethyl allyl pyrophosphate . the rethrolone moieties of pyrethrins are biosynthesized from linolenic acid via oxylipin pathway  <cit> . the most prominent types of pyrethrin are pyrethrin i and ii. these are classified as terpenoids which are derived from cytosolic mevalonate  and plastidial methylerythritol 4-phosphate  pathway. pyrethrins are more concentrated in the flower heads  <cit> . evidences support the involvement of both the biseriate and capitate glandular trichomes in the synthesis and storage of the pyrethrins  <cit> . however, authentic evidences are still lacking in support of the synthesis and storage.fig.  <dig> major pyrethrins  reported from naturally occurring pyrethrin compound. a represents derivatives of acid moieties i.e. chrysanthemic acid and pyrethric acid. b represents derivatives of alcohol moieties i.e., cinerolone, pyrethrolone and jasmolone. c represents pyrethrin i, cinerin i, jasmolin i and pyrethrin ii, cinerin ii, jasmolin ii




most of the already known enzymes involved in the mva pathway for monoterpene pyrethrin biosynthesis were found to be specifically expressed in the flower in comparison to leaf. already reported literature suggested that the initial reactions of the pyrethrin biosynthetic pathway occured in the leaves, while the later modifications and its localization occur in the flower tissue and therefore the concentration of the pyrethrin is much more in the flowers. the identification of the transcripts responsible for de novo biosynthesis of pyrethrins from our current annotations was corroborated from the chromatograms suggesting that pyrethrins are majorly present in the flower as compared to leaf tissue of t. cinerariifolium from hplc .

there are two moieties involved in the process of biosynthesis of pyrethrin. the acid moieties are irregular monoterpenoid unit constitute a cyclopropane ring formed by the condensation of the two dmapp molecules, the reaction is catalysed by chrysanthemyl diphosphate ; a key enzyme, responsible for the conversion of chrysanthemic acid via intermediate precursor formation like chrysanthemol, chrysanthemal etc. both the pathways i.e. mep and mva are responsible for the formation of dmapp, in transcriptome analysis; it has been found that the number of candidate genes is higher in mep pathway, operating in the plastid. on this basis it can be concluded that, dmapp is predominately formed via mep pathway and thus further utilized for the formation of acid moiety for the formation of pyrethrin.

synthesis of chrysanthemic acid starts from glyceraldehyde -3-phosphate. the conversion of g-3-p to dox and to mep and further to 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase   by 4-diphosphocytidyl- 2-c-methyl- d-erythritol kinase    corresponds to the biosynthetic pathway for pyrethrins. further conversion involves enzymes; 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol  <dig> -cyclodiphosphate synthase, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase, isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase  that are specifically upregulated in leaves. according to the proposed pathway , some specific cyp450s and udp-glycosyltransferases  may catalyze the conversion of chrysanthemol and rethrolone to various pyrethrins  <cit> . to date, no genes related to cyp <dig> that is involved in pyrethrin biosynthesis have been identified from t. cinerariifolium. from transcriptome analysis the identified  <dig> cytochrome p <dig>  with monooxygenase activity is highly expressed specifically in leaves  as compared to flower , and hence, it can be hypothesized that acid moiety of pyrethrins in t. cinerariifolium is derived from mep pathway. the cppase ; which is a key enzyme responsible for the de novo biosynthesis of pyrethrins is predominant in the flower tissue with a single transcript; however, in leaf tissue the enzyme was totally absent or no transcript was found .

the alcohol moiety, rethrolone is chemically similar to plant hormone jasmonic acid. the biosynthesis of rethrolones starts with hydroxylation of linolineic acid catalysed by lipooxygenase   to give 13-hydroperoxylinolenic acid. the formation of 13-hydroperoxylinolenic acid, working as a substrate for the formation of allene oxide synthase , which further catalyses the synthesis of unstable intermediate epoxyoctadecatrienoic acid and converted to allene oxide  <cit> . the subsequent enzymes involved in the pyrethrin pathway like allene oxide cyclase , responsible for the conversion of allene oxide to cis-opda, which is further exported to peroxisome where it is reduced to 3-oxo-2-cyclopentane-1octanoic acid via opda reductase. however, in the present transcriptomic data, the number of transcripts in flower  was found higher than in leaves  for aos and aoc respectively. the further conversions involves various important enzymes  which are formed as intermediates like 3-oxo-2-pentenyl-cyclopentane-1-octanoic co-a ligase , 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase  and 3-oxo-2--cyclopentane-1-octanoate  and leads to the formation of jasmonic acid and followed by three cycles of β-oxidation and finally to cis jasmine  <cit> . from this data it can be hypothesized that the oxylipin pathway transcripts are predominantly upregulated in leaves as compared to the flower.

cyp <dig> is one of the oldest protein families, has catalytic oxidation function of carbon-carbon bond, alkyl hydroxylation and hydroxyl oxidation, and plays an important role in plant secondary metabolites synthesis process  <cit> . the data and analysis identified differentially expressed cyp <dig> genes which can be further assessed for their specific roles in pyrethrin biosynthesis.

in conclusion, the large number of assembled unigenes in both the tissues  related to pyrethrin biosynthetic pathway derived from t. cinerariifolium provides an ideal approach to novel unigenes discovery for a non-model plant that lacks a reference genome. additionally, the data will be useful in relating the genes associated with the secondary metabolites production and also to analyze the delineation of the functional transcript.

CONCLUSIONS

de novo assembly of the transcriptome of t. cinerariifolium provides a powerful resource to study biochemical, physiological and genetic processes as well as identification of the metabolic pathways related to pyrethrin biosynthesis in pyrethrum and other related species viz; tagetes etc. this study provides the first tissue specific transcripts  catalogue, which has been generated using 101bp illumina assembly in pyrethrum. the dataset, including  <dig>  million reads for flower and  <dig>  million reads for leaf was generated in our study, which can be associated to understand the regulatory cascades and the potential candidate genes, to trace the developmental processes and to study the expression profiles of the transcripts. in this data it has been found that mep pathway was involved in the biosynthesis of acid moiety of pyrethrin and this pathway predominates in flower as compared to leaf but enzymes related to oxylipin biosynthesis were found predominately in leaf tissue, which suggests that major steps of pyrethrin biosynthesis take place in the flower and this supports the previous studies. besides pyrethrin biosynthesis, the “omics”  studies may be applied to derive the beneficial and efficient selection of genotypes owing the desired traits in future.
