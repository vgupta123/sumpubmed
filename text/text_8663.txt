BACKGROUND
osteoblasts and adipocytes derive from a common mesenchymal progenitor and appear to display plasticity between the phenotypes and an inverse relationship between expression of the two lineages under certain pathological and several experimental conditions  <cit> . for example, a reciprocal relationship between marrow adipocyte content and bone mass has been reported in osteoporosis  <cit> . studies on the senescence-accelerated   <cit>  and aging mouse  <cit>  models also suggest that osteoblastogenesis is decreased concomitant with an increase in the number of marrow adipocytes.

as summarized previously  <cit> , however, it can often be difficult to interpret the developmental and cellular basis of the inverse relationship between osteoblasts and adipocytes, when both bi-/multipotential progenitors reside in the same populations as restricted monopotential progenitors that may display plasticity or transdifferentiation capacity. data from different approaches confirm multiple possible cellular events underlying transitions between the two lineages . thus, the number of adipocytes in bone marrow stromal or bone-derived populations may reflect the frequency of committed adipocyte precursors , the conversion of osteoprogenitor cells and/or osteoblasts into adipocytes , and changes to the balance in commitment choices of mesenchymal stem cells . specific treatments and different culture conditions including different cell densities may dependently or independently affect any or all of these lineage choices.

adipocyte differentiation is under the control of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors , members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, in concert with members of the ccaat/enhancer-binding protein  family of basic leucine zipper nuclear transcription factors  <cit> . the analyses of homo- and heterozygous pparγ-deficient mice and es cells have suggested that pparγ may positively and negatively determine the fate of osteo-adipocyte precursors respectively at least during early differentiation events  <cit> . the thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents, which are pparγ-selective ligands, induce adipogenesis in a variety of culture models including mesenchymal stem/stromal cells and cell lines . however, different ligands of the thiazolidinedione class with different capacities for pparγ activation appear to differentially modulate adipogenesis versus osteoblastogenesis in the mouse model  <cit> . taken together, these reports suggest that pparγ-selective ligands may induce adipogenesis not only in mesenchymal stem or multipotential progenitor cells , but also in osteoprogenitors and/or osteoblasts .

three members of the c/ebp family  have also been implicated in adipocyte differentiation  <cit> . analyses of the differentiation program in adipocytic cell lines and genetically altered mice have shown that c/ebp and ppar work sequentially and cooperatively to stimulate the molecular events required for adipogenesis. c/ebpβ and δ also activate osteocalcin gene transcription and synergize with runt-related transcription factor  <dig> , a master regulator for osteoblastogenesis, at the c/ebp element to regulate bone-specific expression  <cit> . to elucidate the contribution of recruitment from a committed osteoblast precursor pool  versus multipotential progenitor pool  to adipogenesis induced by the pparγ-selective ligand brl- <dig> , we compared primary cultures of fetal rat calvaria  cells  with rat bone marrow  cultures   <cit> .

RESULTS
the temporal sequence of osteoblast development in both the rbm and rc cell culture models has been well-described, and data support the concept that the models reflect a preponderance of multi/bipotential progenitors in the rbm system versus a preponderance of osteoprogenitors in the rc cell system  <cit> . to determine whether there is a difference in the effects of brl on osteoblastogenesis between these two models, we first assessed the number of bone nodules and adipocyte colonies in rbm versus rc cell cultures treated with brl . brl increased the number of adipocyte colonies formed in both culture models, while it markedly decreased bone nodule formation in rbm but had no detectable effect on bone nodule formation in rc cells even at 10-fold higher concentrations  than used for rbm cultures. during bone nodule formation in both rbm and rc cell cultures, the expected sequential marked upregulation of osteoblast markers was seen, while adipocyte markers remained relatively low and stable . in agreement with its effects on bone nodule/adipocyte colony formation, brl increased adipocyte marker , fatty acid-binding protein , and adipsin) and decreased osteoblast marker , alkaline phosphatase , bone sialoprotein , and osteocalcin ) mrna levels throughout the time course in rbm cultures . also consistent with the brl-induced increase in adipocyte colony number in rc cultures, expression of adipocyte markers was increased by brl treatment of rc cells at all time points, but especially days  <dig> and  <dig> . compared to the fetal adipose tissue control , expression levels of adipocyte markers are lower in the brl-treated rc and rbm cell cultures, but consistent with the frequency of adipocytic versus non-adipocytic cells in each case  and rosiglitazone effects in vivo <cit> . on the other hand and in parallel with the lack of effect of brl on the number of bone nodules formed , osteoblast marker mrna levels were either unchanged or changed only slightly by brl at all doses tested, i.e., alp and bsp levels were slightly upregulated at day  <dig> . notably, expression of the mrna for osteoblast master regulator gene, runx <dig>  was not affected by brl treatment at any time in rc cell cultures .

to address whether the lack of suppression of osteoblastogenesis by brl in rc cell cultures was due to the absence of its receptor, pparγ, or other transcription factors involved in the adipogenesis cascade, real-time pcr of the ppar and c/ebp family members was performed on rna from rc cells throughout the differentiation time course . amongst molecules examined, c/ebpβ was found only after robust amplification  and, even then, was not seen consistently in rc samples . on the other hand, ppar mrnas as well as c/ebpα mrnas were detected over the time course of osteoblast development; pparγ expression decreased, while the expression of pparα and c/ebpα gradually increased, and pparδ/β and c/ebpδ remained unchanged. amongst these transcription factors, pparγ and c/ebpα expression was significantly increased in brl-treated rc cells at all times tested , raising the possibility that brl may convert at least some osteogenic cells or their precursors towards an adipogenic phenotype.

because rc cell cultures comprise a heterogeneous mix of osteoprogenitor cell types at multiple differentiation stages  <cit>  as well as a small number of fibroblastic cells, adipocyte precursors  <cit>  and a small multipotential side population  <cit> , we next used a more discriminating assay than total population analysis to address the question of whether osteogenic cells can differentiate into adipocytes when treated with brl. we therefore plated rc cells at very low density and analysed single cell-derived isolated colonies ; fig. 4a shows a representative  <dig> mm dish plated at low density for the colony forming unit  assay). we confirmed that brl treatment had no detectable effect on the growth rate or total number of cfus , ruling out a generalized mitogenic or toxic effect of brl in the rc cell population. when we quantified the phenotypes of individual colony types present, we found that brl had no significant effect on the number of colonies with an osteoblastic phenotype , but induced oil red o-single positive  as well as alp/oil red o-double positive  colonies. note especially that many of the adipocyte colonies also contained alp-positive cells . the percentage of such double-stained colonies increased over the time course of the experiment, such that by the end of the experiment , a large number of oil red o-positive colonies induced by brl also had alp-positive cells, suggesting that brl induced expression of both the osteoblast and adipocyte developmental programs in some rc progenitor cells.

we next assessed adipocyte and osteoblast marker expression at day  <dig> in individual colonies with definitive osteoblast  or definitive adipocyte  or mixed  phenotypes as defined morphologically; brl induced a significant shift in colony type from single alp+ colonies to double alp+/oil red o+ colonies . a representative agarose gel with amplimers obtained by semiquantitative rt-pcr of rna from  <dig> randomly selected colonies is shown in fig. 5a:  <dig> alp+ colonies  from vehicle-treated culture dishes, and  <dig> alp+ colonies  and  <dig> colony with typical adipocyte morphology  from brl-treated culture dishes . representative results from quantification of osteo/adipocyte marker mrnas in  <dig> double alp+/oil red o+ colonies in comparison to three alp+ and three oil red o+ colonies are shown in fig. 5b. a summary of results from  <dig> randomly selected colonies  and  <dig> alp+ colonies from cultures grown in the presence or absence of brl respectively, and  <dig> oil red o+ colonies from brl-treated cultures) is shown in table  <dig>  of the  <dig> alp+ colonies formed in the absence of brl,  <dig> colonies expressed ocn, but none of them expressed adipsin;  <dig> of these also expressed pparγ or c/ebpα and  <dig> colonies expressed both . the  <dig> adipocyte . brl induced a significant shift in colony types from ones expressing only one of pparγ or c/ebpα to ones expressing both factors , and from ones expressing ocn alone to those expressing both ocn and adipsin, as well as pparγ and c/ebpα . taken together with the morphological assessment of colony types, our results suggest that at least some osteoprogenitor cells are induced by brl to upregulate an adipogenic differentiation program.

discussion
treatment of mouse or rat  stromal cell cultures with brl- <dig> , a selective ligand for pparγ, elicits reciprocal effects on adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis, stimulating the former and inhibiting the latter, as described  <cit> . in contrast, the ligand does not alter the functional fate or endpoint of committed osteoprogenitors resident in rc populations, i.e., formation of mineralized bone colonies is not altered, even though adipogenesis is induced in this population. on the other hand, some single cell-derived osteoblastic colonies in brl-treated but not untreated rc populations co-express markers of both mature osteoblast and adipocyte. these results suggest a clear difference in the progenitor status between the two populations and support the conclusion that brl may show capacity to recruit adipocytes from multiple precursor pools .

it is worth considering that because rbm  and rc cells  are embryologically distinct, the regulation of fate selection by progenitors in the stromal versus calvarial populations may be different. for example, some hormones and growth factors regulate intramembranous or periosteal bone formation  differently than endosteal bone formation  . thus, rc and rbm cells may be subject to differential regulation by activation of pparγ , while responding similarly to other factors, e.g., dexamethasone  <cit>  and endogenous glucocorticoids as evidenced by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-overexpressing mice driven by α1-collagen promoter  <cit> .

bone marrow stromal cell populations, often referred to as mesenchymal stem cells, are capable of undergoing differentiation along multiple mesenchymal lineages, but are heterogeneous in the capacity of individual colonies  to express multilineage versus more restricted capacity . however, the frequency of multipotential progenitors in stromal populations appears quite high, e.g., ~30% of single cell-derived colonies in human stroma  <cit>  and >90% in a recently-described alternative isolation/enrichment method  <cit> . as described above, rc cell populations also contain a mixture of cell lineages and types, e.g., osteoprogenitors and osteoblasts at different differentiation stages, fibroblastic cells, adipocyte precursors  <cit> , as well as a multipotential side population  <cit> . however, the frequency of functionally multipotential precursor or stem cells, e.g., the rcj <dig> , clonally-derived multipotential cell line  <cit> , bipotential adipo-osteoprogenitors  <cit>  or sp cells  <cit>  appears to be very low in rc populations. additionally, rc populations contain preadipocytes  <cit>   and possibly circulating progenitor cells from bone marrow  <cit> . our data support the view that brl induces differentiation/maturation of adipocytes mainly from a committed preadipocyte pool in rc populations. however, our data on single cell colonies suggest that a subpopulation of committed osteoprogenitors or relatively mature osteoblasts is also induced to switch on the adipogenic pathway  when pparγ is activated, as we also recently proposed with leukemia inhibitory factor treatments  <cit> . the expression of pparγ and/or c/ebps in some osteogenic cells in our models and mc3t3-e <dig> cells  <cit>  may also predispose them to the pathway  <dig>  it is also possible that at least some of the osteo-adipogenic cells in brl-treated rc populations represent recruitment from multipotential or bipotential progenitor pools equivalent to those in stromal cell populations; the low frequency of such cells in rc populations would not be expected to markedly alter overall osteoblast or adipocyte colony numbers , although we cannot discount the possibility that activation of pparγ dramatically changes their frequency.

in brl-treated single cell colonies, mineralized colonies with and without adipsin expression  correlated with high and low levels of pparγ respectively, which is consistent with the hypothesis that rc cell populations comprise two kinds or differentiation stages of progenitor or osteoblastic cells as we described previously with respect to glucocorticoid regulation  <cit> , i.e., a subpopulation responsive to the pparγ selective ligand and a non-responsive subpopulation, with the former capable of expressing both the adipocyte and osteoblast programs and the latter expressing only the osteoblast program. our data are also consistent with the view that activation of pparγ alone by its ligand is not sufficient to induce complete conversion of osteoprogenitor cells into adipocytes. this view is consistent with an earlier report in which the pparγ selective ligand was unable to increase pparγ expression and cause adipocyte differentiation in human adult trabecular-derived bone cells, although these cells were able to undergo adipogenesis in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine  plus dexamethasone with concomitant increase in expression of pparγ  <cit> . treatment of mc3t3-e <dig> cells retrovirally overexpressing pparγ with insulin, dexamethasone and ibmx increases the adipogenic capacity, which is further enhanced when c/ebpα is co-overexpressed  <cit> . together these data suggest that mechanisms beyond activation of pparγ by its ligand  are required for changing the fate of committed osteoprogenitor cells and/or osteoblasts into adipocytes.

brl is a potent pparγ-selective ligand but it is also known to increase pparγ expression  <cit> , as it did in rc cells, along with c/ebpα. these two transcription factors display interactive regulatory roles and cooperate to promote adipocyte differentiation  <cit> . the role of these two factors, or other members of the families in osteoblasts has been investigated recently . wnt/β-catenin signaling suppresses c/ebpα and pparγ, which shifts mesenchymal cell fate toward osteoblastogenesis at the expense of adipogenesis  <cit> . the lack of coordinate expression of ppapγ and c/ebpα during osteoblast differentiation in our models suggests that they may not cooperate in osteoblast differentiation as they do in adipocyte differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study showed clear differences in the capacity of the pparγ-selective ligand brl- <dig> to alter the fate choices of precursor cells in stromal versus calvarial cell populations and that recruitment of adipocytes can occur from multiple precursor cell pools ). they also show that mechanisms beyond activation of pparγ by its ligand are required for changing the fate of committed osteoprogenitor cells and/or osteoblasts into adipocytes.
