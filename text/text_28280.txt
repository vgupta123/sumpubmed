BACKGROUND
the major histocompatibility complex  plays a central role in the immune system of all jawed vertebrates. it is the most polymorphic genomic region identified, and encodes proteins involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses
 <cit> . particularly, the mhc class i and class ii genes encode proteins that bind to and carry small antigen peptides to the cell surface thus presenting them to cytotoxic t cells or helper t cells. this in turn triggers the downstream immune cascade. therefore, this genomic region is crucial for the organism’s resistance and susceptibility to pathogenic disease
 <cit> .

despite its functional consistency, the mhc genomic cluster has different gene organization patterns across different organisms. the latest genomic map of the human mhc  spans about  <dig>  mb and contains  <dig> gene loci on a contiguous region on chromosome 6
 <cit> , whereas the mhc regions of other organisms generally have a different gene order and size, or are even scattered on separate chromosomes
 <cit> . notably, the chicken  has two genetically independent mhc clusters, the mhc-b and mhc-y . both are located on microchromosome  <dig> 
 <cit> . there has been some evidence for the gene expression and function for disease susceptibility of the mhc-y region, but it is the mhc-b that is believed to be the main functional mhc genomic region of chicken
 <cit> . the highly streamlined mhc-b, which includes genes encoding class i and class iib molecules, contains only  <dig> genes and is about 92kb in length
 <cit> . sequencing efforts have also been made on other bird species, such as mallard duck, red-winged blackbird, house finch and zebra finch
 <cit> . however, none of these species seem to share the characteristics of the minimal essential chicken mhc.

the chicken and other fowl species belong to the order galliformes. available mhc maps of other galliform birds generally show the same compact feature of this genomic region as that of chicken. for example, the mhc-b of the turkey  has a good synteny with the chicken mhc-b, the only exceptions being that turkey mhc-b has more bg and blb  gene copies and an inversion of the tapbp gene
 <cit> . the quail  mhc-b includes an expanded number of duplicated genes and the numbers of the duplicated loci also vary to some extent among individuals
 <cit> . the mhc-b of the golden pheasant  also shows a good synteny with chicken, but has two inversions of tapbp and tap1-tap2
 <cit> .

black grouse  is a wild galliform bird species that has been well-studied from an ecological perspective, including conservation genetics, behavioural ecology, sexual selection and the evolution of the lek mating system
 <cit> . previous work on the black grouse mhc identified the mhc-b and mhc-y genomic loci, and the polymorphism of the second exon of the mhc class iib gene has been surveyed at the population level
 <cit> . in this paper, we investigate the detailed genomic organization of the black grouse mhc-b region. we constructed a fosmid library to sequence the mhc-b genomic cluster and used roche 454-transcriptome sequencing  to verify the expression of the identified genes
 <cit> . the results allow us to conduct a comprehensive comparative genomics analysis of the galliform mhc region. due to a previous lack of genomic data on avian mhc regions this kind of analysis has not previously been feasible. the black grouse mhc sequence, together with four other completely characterized galliform mhc regions, thus offer a unique opportunity in bird mhc studies.

RESULTS
sequence of the black grouse mhc-b region
four overlapping mhc-bearing fosmid clones with lengths of  <dig>  bp -  <dig>  bp were identified and sequenced . they were aligned into a consensus sequence of  <dig>  bp . this sequence covers the majority of the black grouse mhc-b region , from the btn <dig> gene to the cyp <dig> gene. since the sequenced black grouse we used was a wild and not inbred animal, we found clones from both homologous chromosomes. more specifically, p2d <dig> was found to be from a different chromosome than the other three clones . to maximize the possibility of obtaining a real complete haplotype of the black grouse mhc, we used the combined sequences of p3b <dig> and p5b <dig> for the consensus sequence for the heterozygous parts. therefore, our black grouse mhc sequence was for the most part a real haplotype, apart from the small gap  between p3b <dig> and p5b <dig> which was only covered by p2d <dig>  sequencing both homologous chromosomes provided us the opportunity to identify polymorphisms in the heterozygous parts. from the heterozygous overlap  of p3b <dig> and p2d <dig>  we found  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  and  <dig> deletion-insertion polymorphisms . from the much smaller overlap  of the p2d <dig> and p5b <dig>  we found  <dig> snps and  <dig> dips .

five chicken repeats  were identified, of which cr1-f and cr1-x <dig> were also found to match the chicken mhc-b. we also found  <dig> simple sequence repeats  in the black grouse mhc-b region . the average gc content of the black grouse mhc-b region is  <dig> %, which is as high as that of the chicken  . this is probably because the region we sequenced lay on the gene intensive bf/blb region, which had a higher gc content than the other regions. also, the black grouse mhc has a high density of cpg islands , which may indicate the functional importance of this region
 <cit> .

gene identification and verification
all the three gene prediction programs used could identify most of the genes located on black grouse mhc-b, and most of the chicken, turkey and golden pheasant mhc genes could be well aligned with their homologous genes on black grouse mhc-b. therefore,  <dig> genes including btn <dig> , btn <dig>  blec <dig>  blec <dig>  blb <dig>  tapbp, blb <dig>  brd <dig>  dma, dmb <dig>  dmb <dig>  bf <dig>  tap <dig>  tap <dig>  bf <dig>  c <dig>  cenpa, cyp <dig>  were confirmed at least by three of the above approaches . the only exception was the gene bg1: fgenesh and genscan did not identify this gene and the comparison with chicken and turkey gave inconsistent results. therefore, the annotation of this gene is only based on the result from the genemark prediction and was checked manually.

from our rna-seq data,  <dig> reads could be mapped onto  <dig> predicted genes in the black grouse mhc-b region, with an average mapped contig length of  <dig>  bp. that is,  <dig> out of the  <dig> predicted genes  had concrete evidence of gene expression . the gene expression levels of the verified genes were variable. for example, btn <dig>  dmb <dig> and tapbp were highly expressed, with mean sequence coverage per nucleotide of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the mhc class i and class iib also had high levels of gene expression. the sequencing coverage per nucleotide of bf <dig>  blb <dig> and blb <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. in contrast, the genes bg <dig>  blec <dig>  dmb <dig>  tap <dig> and cyp <dig> only had one single transcript read mapped each. within genes, there was a strong 3- prime  bias of the number of the transcripts mapped; this is likely due to the technical nature of the cdna library preparation
 <cit> . the absence of the verification of some exons may also be an artefact of the library preparation, limited sequencing depth or data analysis strategy, and does not necessarily mean that the exons are not expressed
 <cit> .

comparative genomics of the galliform mhc-b
the black grouse mhc-b genomic region shares an almost perfect synteny with that of chicken, the gene numbers and gene orders of the two species are identical . compared to the turkey mhc-b, black grouse mhc-b has less bg genes and less blb genes, but the mhcs of the two species are still highly similar. the golden pheasant mhc-b also has more blb genes than that of black grouse . the quail mhc-b has significant expansions of blb genes and bf genes, and has some pseudogenes scattered in this region, but the black grouse mhc-b is still in an obvious synteny with it.

the most remarkable features of the galliform mhc-b is the gene orientation of tapbp, tap <dig> and tap <dig>  the black grouse mhc-b has inversed tapbp and tap1-tap <dig> blocks compared to the chicken, while only the tap1-tap <dig> block is inversed compared to the turkey. the golden pheasant shares the same gene orientation of tapbp and tap1-tap <dig> block with black grouse, where the gene orientation of these gene/gene blocks for quail is the same as that of chicken .

looking at the genes separately, we found that most of them were very similar in terms of nucleotide and amino acid sequence between the five galliform species . however, the phylogenetic relationships of these genes are not consistent. the phylogenetic tree constructed using the entire mhc-b sequences of the five species  follows the neutral expectation
 <cit> . the phylogeny of the coding sequences of tapbp, brd <dig>  dma, dmb <dig>  bf <dig> and tap <dig> share the same tree topology with the tree constructed using the entire mhc-b, whereas the phylogenetic trees for the coding sequences of blec <dig>  blb <dig>  blb <dig>  dmb <dig>  tap <dig> and bf <dig> show different tree topologies within the clade of black grouse, turkey and golden pheasant . interestingly, genes with aberrant phylogenetic relationships  showed signs of having elevated dn/ds ratios compared to genes following the phylogenetically neutral expectation . this could be interpreted as an indication of increased balancing selection or relaxed purifying selection acting on these genes.

discussion
we have sequenced, annotated and analysed the mhc-b gene cluster of the black grouse. black grouse is a wild bird species and represents the lineage tetraoninae in the galliformes
 <cit> . with the availability of its mhc sequence and several other fully sequenced galliform mhc we now, for the first time, have the opportunity to perform a comparative genomic study of avian mhc. the mhc-b gene cluster of black grouse is just as simple and streamlined as that of chicken
 <cit>  . by contrast, the quail mhc-b has more duplicated genes and pseudogenes  compared to black grouse
 <cit>  . the turkey mhc-b and the golden pheasant mhc-b, which are phylogenetically closer to black grouse than chicken and quail, also have expanded blb genes
 <cit>  . our results provide additional evidence that the extremely compact nature of the chicken mhc is not merely an artefact of domestication, since we find a similar pattern in a wild related species that is fully outbred.

the nucleotide identity of the black grouse mhc-b shows high similarity with that of other galliform birds . however, individual mhc genes might have different evolutionary histories. the phylogenetic tree based on the entire mhc-b sequence shows exactly the same topology as neutral markers
 <cit>  . but when we used the coding sequences of each gene independently, only tapbp, brd <dig>  dma, dmb <dig>  bf <dig> and tap <dig> share the same tree topology with neutral genes . interestingly, for the genes blec <dig>  dmb <dig>  tap <dig> and bf <dig>  the black grouse is more divergent than turkey and pheasant, while for the two blb genes , black grouse is closer to pheasant than turkey . if we use the dn/ds values to estimate the selection pressure on the genes, we find that the genes following the neutral phylogenetic expectation generally have lower dn/ds values than genes with aberrant tree topologies . taken together the deviation from neutral phylogenetic patterns and elevated dn/ds levels indicates that the molecular evolution of several of the genes in the galliform mhc region is affected by selective forces. especially, the mhc class iib genes  show elevated levels of dn/ds. the peptide binding regions of these genes are classical examples of balancing selection
 <cit> . an intriguing possibility is that the clustering of the grouse blb and pheasant blb might be due to specific selection in the wild since they were both sampled from natural populations, but this hypothesis needs further confirmation.

another striking finding of the comparison of galliform mhc-b is the repeated inversions of the tapbp gene and the tap1-tap <dig> block . using data from all available galliform mhc sequences, we found that the inversion of the tapbp gene, located between the two mhc class iib loci, seems to have happened once in the clade; either in the lineage leading to chicken and quail or in the lineage of pheasant, turkey and grouse, depending on the ancestral state. by contrast, the inversion of the tap1-tap <dig> gene block has occurred at least twice  during the evolution of this clade. the tap1-tap <dig> block is flanked by the two class i genes, bf <dig> and bf <dig>  the events of gene conversion or interlocus recombination in the evolution of mhc genes have been reported before . here, our result could provide an indirect evidence for such events since if the gene conversion occurred repeatedly, the non-random breakpoints beside the two bf loci may lead to the inversion of the gene block tap1-tap <dig> between them. however, this needs to be further tested.

in this study, we constructed a fosmid library and used it to screen of the mhc genes. fosmid libraries have been widely used in large genome projects such as gap closure of the human genome or metagenomics analysis
 <cit> . the success of our experiment demonstrates that the fosmid library is also suitable and convenient to sequence specific genome regions of a species whose genome map is unavailable. to verify the expression of the identified mhc genes, we mapped the transcriptome data of a  <dig> sequencing project to the mhc region. this allows us to efficiently confirm the expression of  <dig> identified genes. however, due to the limited  <dig> sequencing depth, it was not possible to cover all the  <dig> putatively expressed genes. moreover, not all exons were verified in the expressed genes. this could be because of limited sequencing coverage, alternative splicing or artefacts from the mapping method to the short exons
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that there is large synteny between the mhc-b region of the black grouse and that of other galliform birds. some large scale changes like gene duplications and genomic rearrangements have, however, occurred within the galliform lineage. some of the genes in the region also seem to have been affected by selective forces within this clade, as inferred from deviating phylogenetic signals and elevated rates of non-synonymous substitutions. the mhc-b sequence of the black grouse reported here will provide a very valuable resource for future studies on the evolution of the avian mhc genes and on immunogenetics and ecology in black grouse.
