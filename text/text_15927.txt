BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative bacterium, colonising the human gastric mucosa. it is responsible for diverse duodenal- and stomach-related disorders, such as ulcers, b cell malt lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma  <cit> . motility of this bacterium is accomplished by polar sheathed flagella and has been shown to be essential for colonisation, based on animal infection studies  <cit> . flagella are also involved in adhesion and induction of inflammatory response in the host  <cit> . since motility is a virulence-related trait, improving our understanding of flagellum biogenesis in h. pylori might help develop intervention strategies or therapeutics.

h. pylori flagellar gene transcription is tightly controlled by three rna polymerase sigma factors σ <dig>  σ <dig> and σ <dig>  <cit> . σ <dig> controls the transcription of class i genes . σ <dig>  is responsible for the transcription of class ii genes . rpon transcriptional activity is dependent on additional regulators, such the flgr/flgs system and the chaperone hp <dig>  <cit> . class iii genes  are under the control of σ <dig>  and the anti-sigma factor flgm  <cit> .

the flagellar export system is recognized as a version of type iii secretion systems  <cit> , and during flagellar assembly, it delivers structural components from the cytoplasm to the cell surface and growing organelle. this mechanism is dependent upon export chaperones that protect and deliver structural subunits to the membrane-associated export atpase, flii. in salmonella, several flagellar chaperones have been identified. flgn has chaperone activity for the hook proteins flgl and flgk. the chaperone flit is dedicated to the capping protein flid, and flis to the flagellin flic  <cit> . the ablation of genes encoding flgn, flit and flis impairs the stability and the secretion of their dedicated substrates flgk, flgl, flic and flid  <cit> . flagellar biogenesis has been extensively investigated in salmonella and e. coli  <cit> . annotation of two h. pylori genomes identified homologues of most flagellar genes of the salmonella/e. coli paradigm  <cit> . however, some flagellar homologues have not been found in h. pylori, presumably due to low sequence identity. previous bioinformatics searches, targeting only functional domains, were successfully performed to identify the anti-sigma factor flgm  <cit> , and flik was also identified by a bioinformatic approach  <cit> .

in an effort to identify novel flagellar genes in sequenced h. pylori genomes, bioinformatic analysis focusing on identification of specific and conserved domains of flagellar genes was performed. in salmonella, flij is a  <dig> kda protein with a relative abundance of charged residues. fraser and colleagues showed that flij in salmonella interacts with flih  and flha   <cit> . flij was initially thought to display chaperone activity  <cit> . however, a recent study clearly indicated that flij is not a export chaperone for subunits of the hook and the filament  <cit> . flij binds to export chaperones flgn and flit and is involved in an escort mechanism, whereby flij promotes cycling of the export chaperones flgn and flit. a flij homologue was not found in the initial annotation of two h. pylori genomes, nor incidentally were homologues for flgn or flit  <cit> . although searches based on the full-length sequence of flij did not identify any h. pylori homologues, a search using only the essential flij domain  did reveal a potential homologue . this analysis identified hp <dig>  encoding a hypothetical protein with unknown function and a predicted coiled coil domain.

in the present study, we phenotypically characterized a mutant lacking the hp <dig> gene product and investigated the function of hp <dig> in the flagellar regulon using global transcript analysis. the data suggest a novel role for hp <dig> in motility but not flagellum assembly, and involvement in production of cell surface proteins.

RESULTS
bioinformatic analysis of hp0256
psi-blast searches using the full length flij sequence from salmonella did not identify any homologues in h. pylori. however, using only the flij n-terminal coiled-coil domain as a search query, hp <dig> was identified as a potential flij homologue. the annotation of this h. pylori orf indicates a hypothetical protein with an unknown function. both flij and hp <dig> proteins have a similar size  and have a high likelihood of forming n-terminal coiled-coils. they share 17% identity and 44% similarity. in contrast, flij from salmonella and e. coli are 88% identical and 96% similar. further searches identified potential hp <dig> homologues in more related species . an alignment of these is shown in figure  <dig>  hp <dig> is 22% identical and 51% similar to ws <dig> of wolinella succinogenes, 28% identical and 51% similar to zp_ <dig> of campylobacter concisus and 23% identical and 65% similar to cj1497c of campylobacter jejuni.

for each of the flij and hp <dig> sequence groups, both paircoil <dig> and pcoils were run   <cit> . for paircoil <dig>  approximately  <dig> flij annotated sequences, ranging from  <dig> to 15% overall identity, were used. each sequence gave essentially the same profile, and the program output yielded the same region  with the same heptad register. hence the predicted coiled coil domains were internally consistent for the flij family and the hp <dig> family. in addition, the predicted coiled coil domains matched between families  <cit> .

the gene for the salmonella flij protein is flanked by those of the flii atpase and the hook length control protein flik, as part of the flie operon. flagellar genes in h. pylori are not contained in such large operons, but are scattered throughout the genome  <cit> . hp <dig> is flanked by an adenylosuccinate synthetase gene  as well as two outer membrane protein genes , and three hypothetical genes, one of which encodes a predicted secreted protein  and the other a predicted integral membrane protein . when comparing hp <dig> with homologues from related species, it did not appear that any one domain of the protein was more or less conserved . this agrees with previous studies of flij data suggesting that the entire protein is necessary for function  <cit> . as this bioinformatic analysis suggested hp <dig> could be a flij homologue, we generated a hp <dig> mutant by inserting a chloramphenicol resistance marker into the gene by allelic exchange as described in methods. growth rates and plate morphology of the hp <dig> mutant were indistinguishable from the wild-type .

ablation of the hp <dig> gene reduces motility
motility plate assay indicated that the hp <dig> mutant was significantly less motile than the wild-type . a similar phenotype was consistently observed in two h. pylori wild-type strains and their derivative hp <dig> mutants , indicating that the reduced motility was not a strain-specific effect. however, the mutants retained some motility. in salmonella, lack of flij abolishes motility  <cit> , suggesting that hp <dig> may not be a flij homologue as initially hypothesized. complementation of a salmonella flij mutant was attempted by introduction of the hp <dig> gene expressed from an e. coli vector promoter. motility plate assay indicated that motility was not restored in the salmonella flij mutant, indicating that hp <dig> was unlikely to be a functional flij homologue in helicobacter pylori . we complemented the p79-derivative hp <dig> mutant, by expressing the hp <dig> gene, integrated into the chromosome, under the control of the flaa promoter . restoration of motility in the complemented mutant confirmed that the partial loss of motility in the mutant was due only to the lack of the hp <dig> gene product.

an hp <dig> mutant produces normal levels of flagellin and hook proteins
the partial loss of motility in the hp <dig> mutant might have been due to altered production levels of major flagellar components. h. pylori flagellum filaments are made of two proteins, a major flagellin flaa and a minor flagellin flab. the hook consists of flge protein. we investigated flagellin and hook protein production in an hp <dig> mutant using immunoblotting analysis with anti-h. pylori flagellin antiserum  <cit> . the antiserum used for immunoblotting is reactive with both flagellins and the hook protein. minamino et al. had previously described a salmonella flij defective mutant which had less flagella than wild-type cells  <cit> . in contrast with a salmonella flij mutant, we could not observe any significant difference in the amount of flagellin protein in the cytoplasm or envelope protein fractions of the hp <dig> mutant compared to corresponding fractions from wild-type cells . the normal production of flge protein compared to the flge up-regulation may be due to a post-transcriptional regulation. interestingly, it appeared that there were more degradation products in the hp <dig> mutant samples compared to the wild-type, and this was consistently observed in technical and biological replicates of the immunoblotting analyses we performed .

an hp <dig> mutant displays a normal flagellum configuration
another plausible explanation for the reduced motility in the hp <dig> mutant would be the presence of flagella with an aberrant morphology. we therefore performed transmission electron microscopy to investigate the flagellum configuration in wild-type and mutant cells. wild-type h. pylori ccug <dig> and p <dig> cells harboured 2- <dig> polar flagella . in the hp <dig> mutant cells, the number and localization of flagella were similar to the wild-type cells . flagella of the mutant cells had the same length as those on wild-type cells. they were sheathed and had normal flagellar hooks.

transcriptional analysis of an hp <dig> mutant
the flagellar circuitry in h. pylori consists of three sigma factors and other regulators, such as the anti-σ <dig> factor flgm and the flgr/flgs activation system  <cit> . the lack of one regulatory player can deregulate the whole flagellar biosynthetic cascade and alter motility in h. pylori. since ablation of the hp <dig> gene reduced motility, we investigated the effect of hp <dig> mutation upon the expression of the flagellar regulon using global transcript analysis. array analysis was performed in quadruplicate, including a dye-swap. five genes were selected to confirm the reliability of our microarray data by qrt-pcr. transcriptional level of hpn was unchanged in the hp <dig> mutant and was therefore used a control for qrt-pcr. the fold changes thus established were in good agreement with the array data . the difference observed in fold-changes of flge transcription between array data and qrt-pcr is due to the microarray analysis method used for the study. this method tends to attenuate the dispersion of the fold-changes compared to the overall signal on the slide.

a total of forty six genes had altered expression levels in the hp <dig> mutant. nineteen genes were significantly up-regulated and twenty seven genes down-regulated in the hp <dig> mutant compared to the wild-type strain . data for some biologically relevant genes, below the two-fold cut-off, are also included in table  <dig>  among the differentially expressed genes, seventeen encode proteins associated with the membrane.

the fold-change and the p-value are indicated. bold fonts were used to highlight genes considered biologically relevant for the present study . full array datasets are in public databases as described in methods.

interestingly, four genes encoding proteins of the hop outer membrane family were identified as differentially expressed in the hp <dig> mutant by microarray analysis . hopa was four fold down-regulated, whereas the other three hop genes were up-regulated. hp <dig> and hp <dig>  encoding respectively the biopolymer transport proteins exbb and exbd, were up-regulated in the hp <dig> mutant. exbb and exbd in e. coli interact with the tonb-dependent energy transduction complex  <cit> . in e. coli, tonb is involved in the transduction of energy between the cytoplasmic membrane and the outer membrane  <cit> . five genes involved in lipopolysaccharide  production were differentially expressed: hp <dig> -fucosyltransferase), hp <dig> -fucosyltransferase), hp <dig>  and hp <dig> .

we identified a number of flagellar genes with altered expression levels . three rpon-dependent genes were significantly up-regulated in the hp <dig> mutant based on the microarray data and the qrt-pcr investigations, i.e. hp0115/flab , hp0870/flge  and hp <dig> . another rpon-dependent gene hp1155/murg  was  <dig>  fold up-regulated with a p-value of  <dig> . however, rpon and its associated regulators flgr, hp <dig> and hp <dig> were transcribed at wild-type levels. as shown in table  <dig>  hp0492/hpaa <dig>  was significantly down-regulated. this gene is known to be essential for flagellar biogenesis, but its transcriptional regulation remains unclear. it has not yet been assigned to any flagellar gene class  <cit> . in the intermediate class, hp <dig>  was  <dig>  fold up-regulated with a p-value of  <dig> . in class i genes, we did not observe significant changes. a slight down-regulation of genes encoding components of the secretion apparatus and the basal body, such as flii, fliq, flib, flgg, was noted without reaching the fold-change cut-off for significance. the flin gene encoding a component of the switch was up-regulated  with a p-value of  <dig> .

full array datasets are in public databases as described in methods. fold-changes and p-values were calculated based on  <dig> independent biological replicates as described in methods. open reading frames and gene annotations were based on the tigr database  <cit> . the genes were classified in different flagellar classes, as previously proposed  <cit> . confirmatory analysis by qrt-pcr was performed for genes with *. values for genes with ** were lost during the initial array data analysis and subsequently recovered using  <dig> independent replicates. for technical reasons, some array spots could not be analyzed in individual arrays.

two genes involved in the cell division process were affected in the hp <dig> mutant. hp0331/mind, coding for a protein involved in the correct localisation of the cell division site  <cit> , was  <dig>  fold down-regulated in the hp <dig> mutant compared to the wild-type . in e. coli, mind  inhibits the cell division protein ftsz, that forms the ftsz or z ring at the septum  <cit> . interestingly, ftsz was  <dig>  fold up-regulated in the hp <dig> mutant .

adhesion and pro-inflammatory properties of an hp <dig> mutant
the microarray data indicated altered expression of a number of genes encoding proteins associated with the cell envelope in the hp <dig> mutant. the genes encoding the well-characterized adhesins baba and babb which bind to fucosylated lewis antigens on human gastric cells were up-regulated in the hp <dig> mutant. to investigate a potential role of hp <dig> in pathogenesis and adhesion, we measured adhesion of hp <dig> mutant cells to gastric epithelial cells, and also interleukin- <dig>  secretion by gastric epithelial cells using an in vitro infection model. adhesion of the hp <dig> mutant to ags cells was significantly reduced to 45% of that of the wild-type  . supernatants from that assay were also used to quantify il- <dig> production by ags cells. ccug <dig> induced an average of  <dig> pg/ml of il- <dig> from ags cells compared to  <dig> pg/ml by the hp <dig> mutant . this is a statistically significant decrease of 20% .

discussion
a focused bioinformatics analysis based on the functional domain of flij  suggested that hp <dig> was a potential flij homologue in h. pylori. hp <dig> encodes a hypothetical protein in h. pylori and shares common properties with flij, such as a similar size and a predicted n-terminal coiled coil. however, in comparison with the complete loss of motility reported in a salmonella flij mutant  <cit> , h. pylori hp <dig> mutants retained some motility based on a motility plate assay. complementation of a salmonella flij mutant was attempted by introduction of the hp <dig> gene product expressed under the control of an e. coli promoter, but this did not restore motility in the transformed salmonella flij mutant . immunoblotting analysis revealed no significant differences in flagellin and hook protein synthesis between the wild-type and the hp <dig> mutant. the partial loss of motility in the hp <dig> mutant was therefore not due to impairment in filament and hook protein production. the increased degradation rate of flagellar proteins observed in the hp <dig> mutant samples compared to the wild-type suggested a possible chaperone activity of hp <dig>  however, the apparently normal flagellum assembly and localisation at the pole in the hp <dig> mutant cells suggested that hp <dig> was not actually essential for flagellum protein stabilization or export apparatus positioning. in the hp <dig> mutant, the significant reduction in motility still remained unclear. quantitative data, e.g. average time and lengths of swimming runs, to characterize the motility phenotype of the hp <dig> mutant would allow us to further comprehend the effect of hp <dig> on helicobacter pylori motility. although this was not mechanistically wholly elucidated, the potential players in this phenotype were identified by array analysis.

global transcript analysis indicated that hp <dig> interferes with the transcription of flagellar genes belonging to the rpon regulon. four rpon-dependent genes were up-regulated in the hp <dig> mutant, although transcription of rpon and its associated regulators flgr, hp <dig> and hp <dig> were at wild-type level. the different transcriptional profiles among rpon-dependent genes suggested that some key rpon-dependent genes may be under additional regulatory checkpoints, likely hp0256-dependent. however, we do not have data to explain the mechanistic links involved in this regulation. among class ii genes, the only known flagellar regulator hp0906/flik controls the hook length and is involved in the hook-filament transition. hp <dig> was transcribed at wild-type level, in agreement with the normal flagellar morphology in hp <dig> mutants . the up-regulation of four rpon-dependent genes in the hp <dig> mutant did not grossly interfere with flagellar assembly as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy . however, a modification of the flaa/flab ratio in flagella significantly affects motility  <cit>  and this may still be responsible for the aberrant functioning of the flagellar organelle seen here.

interestingly, hp <dig> mutant cells were not predominantly swimming but tumbling, based on light microscopy observations. this abnormal motility behaviour, which may explain the reduced motility in the hp <dig> mutant, underlined a probable disruption of the switch mechanism between swimming and tumbling. flig, flim and flin are involved in switching between clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation of the motor and thus, of the filament  <cit> . it is noteworthy that flin was upregulated. other components involved in the switch, flim and flig, were normally expressed. the flim and flin proteins assemble to form a ring, called the c-ring  <cit> . in salmonella, the flin protein is involved in the switch process and its interaction with flih is crucial for the localisation of the flii-flih complex in the c-ring  <cit> . we hypothesize that the  <dig> -fold overexpression of flin may be sufficient to modify the stoichiometry of the switch subunits, disrupting the correct functioning of the switch. the hp <dig> mutant cells would then be unable to properly respond to chemotactic environmental stimuli, as illustrated by the abnormal motility observed in the hp <dig> mutant. a slight caveat for this hypothesis is that we do not have data to confirm an increase of flin protein production in the hp <dig> mutant.

a number of outer membrane proteins and lps-related proteins were differentially expressed in the hp <dig> mutant. baba and babb expression were both up-regulated in the hp <dig> mutant. baba binds to the blood group antigen lewis b  <cit> . the sialic acid-specific adhesin hpaa is enriched in the flagellar sheath  <cit>  and was significantly down-regulated in the hp <dig> mutant. hpaa has been shown to be antigenic but not involved in the interaction with ags cells  <cit> . the modifications of the cell envelope architecture, i.e. adhesins, hop proteins, alpha-2-fucosyltransferase, may explain the reduced ability of the hp <dig> mutant to adhere to host cells and to induce an inflammatory response, i.e. interleukin- <dig> secretion. the disruption of hp <dig> and its effect on cell envelope architecture may modify the lipid profiles and/or membrane fluidity and therefore the function of the methyl-accepting chemotactic proteins. the biological significance of the alteration of expression of mind and ftsz in the hp <dig> mutant, two genes involved in the cell division process, remains unclear. a correlation with other membrane-associated protein expression, such as outer membrane proteins, cannot be excluded and additional experiments will be required to test this.

CONCLUSIONS
we initially hypothesized that hp <dig> was a flij homologue in h. pylori based on bioinformatic analyses. our data clearly show that hp <dig> has a different function in h. pylori, compared to that of flij in salmonella. interestingly, hp <dig> is still obviously involved in flagellum activity as its ablation caused a partial loss of motility. its involvement with expression of some rpon-dependent genes is noteworthy but did not result in major changes in the mutant phenotype . the partial loss of motility must therefore be due to effects upon other flagellar players. based upon its observed up-regulation in the hp <dig> mutant, flin is a potential candidate responsible for the impaired motility we observed in the hp <dig> mutant. further investigation of flin production in the hp <dig> mutant or overexpression in the wild-type would confirm this hypothesis. the large number of membrane-associated proteins with an altered expression in the hp <dig> mutant highlighted another aspect of the mutant phenotype: the alteration of the cell envelope architecture, likely responsible for the weak adhesion to, and the low inflammatory response induced in, host cells. we conclude that hp <dig> is required for full motility of h. pylori, possibly through its involvement with the switch components, but that it also modulates directly or indirectly the normal expression of membrane proteins essential in pathogenesis.
