BACKGROUND
transposable elements  are mobile genetic dna sequences, and they are found in the genomes of nearly all eukaryotes  <cit> . tes can insert copies of themselves into new genomic locations and they have the capacity to multiply. therefore, tes make up a significant portion of the eukaryotic genome and have driven genome evolution in many ways, including gene expression alterations, gene deletions and insertions, chromosome rearrangements and others  <cit> . tes are divided into two major classes based on their transposition intermediate and distinct structural features  <cit> . class i tes, which are also called retrotransposons, use a “copy-and-paste” mechanism that involves an rna intermediate. this intermediate is reverse transcribed before its reintegration into a new position. class ii tes, which are also called dna transposons, use a dna-mediated mode of “cut-and-paste” transposition.

the piggybac element, which is a class ii transposon, was originally discovered in the tn- <dig> cell line of the cabbage looper moth trichoplusia ni  <cit> . it transposes via a “cut-and-paste” mechanism, inserting exclusively at 5′-ttaa-3′ tetranucleotide target sites and excising with precision, leaving no footprint  <cit> . transposons similar to the original functional piggybac ifp <dig> called piggybac-like elements  have been found in diverse organisms, including fungi, plants, insects, crustaceans, urochordates, amphibians, fishes and mammals  <cit> . ples are highly divergent and can be classified into three main classes, namely by high sequence similarity to ifp <dig>  moderate sequence similarity to ifp <dig> and very distantly related ancient elements  <cit> .

the rice stem borer chilo suppressalis walker is one of the most important insect pests of many subtropical and tropical paddy fields in asia, north africa and southern europe. this insect occurs in all the rice-growing areas in china, and it colonizes a wide range of hosts such as rice , water-oat  and chufa   <cit> . it is assumed that all c. suppressalis field populations in china have a common ancestor. however, there is no clear evidence of this. we want to know if c. suppressalis field populations have a common ancestor, and if so, where this common ancestor originated.

for this paper, we isolated a group of endogenous ples from the c. suppressalis genome, which were designated as csuple1s. the csuple <dig> copy with an intact open reading frame  was named csuple <dig> . the frequency of csuple <dig>  insertion at a specific locus in the c. suppressalis genome varied among populations. this study will contribute to our understanding of the distribution and characteristics of the piggybac family. in addition, the analysis csuple1s sequence variants identified in c. suppressalis from different field populations provides insights into the evolution of csuple1s. based on the insertion sites and sequence variations of csuple1s, the phylogeography of c. suppressalis is discussed.

RESULTS
characterization of piggybac-like element  in c. suppressalis
a full-length ple from c. suppressalis was obtained and named csuple <dig>  . this ple is 2406 bp in length and contains all the characteristic structures of a ple, including 13 bp inverted terminal repeats , asymmetrically located 25 bp sub-terminal inverted repeats and a single open reading frame  encoding a transposase of  <dig> amino acids. the putative transposase contains all the aspartate residues of the “ddd” motif, which correspond to d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> in t. ni ifp <dig> transposase. as in other ples, the csuple <dig>  was inserted into typical tetranucleotide target-site ttaa duplications and flanked by a sequence  that was not significantly homologous to any gene sequences in the genbank. notably, csuple <dig>  also has a putative caat site, and a tata site exists at nt 392– <dig> and nt 478– <dig>  there is also a polyadenylation signal site at nt 2188– <dig>  which is characteristic of an actively translated protein. alignments showed that, among the known ples, the putative transposase of csuple <dig>  shared the highest similarity  with hsapgbd <dig> transposase , and belongs to a class that is moderately similar to ifp <dig> figure  <dig>

insertion site, tsds and itr variations
the 5′ te display showed that the insert sites of csuple1s varied between populations . further sequencing results obtained  <dig> different insertion sites among  <dig> flanking sequences from  <dig> field populations . two insertion sites were found in all populations . one insertion site was found in nine populations . one insertion site was found in seven populations . one insertion site was found in five populations . two insertion sites were found in four populations . one insertion site was found in three populations  and the remaining  <dig> insertion sites were found in only one or two populations. almost one half of all populations had a unique insert site, found only in that population .table  <dig>

among these  <dig> different insertion sites, most of the insertions occurred at a ttaa target site, which is characteristic of the ttaa-specific family of piggybac transposons. only four target site duplications  contained variations. in insertion site  <dig>  the tsd was ctat; in insertion site  <dig> and  <dig>  the tsds were atat; in insertion site  <dig>  the tsd was ctaa. the itr analysis showed that the 13 bp itrs of csuple <dig> were conserved in most individuals, with only two itrs containing slight variations. in insertion site  <dig>  there was a c-a variation in the itrs; in insertion site  <dig>  there was a g-a variation in the itrs .table  <dig>

a total of  <dig> copies of the csuple <dig>  insertion were cloned from  <dig> individuals across the  <dig> field populations. these sequences share high levels of similarity with the exception of the flk-ple1jz <dig> copy, which has an approximately 130 bp sequence deletion. there were substitutions, deletions and/or insertions in each copy . furthermore, in some csuple <dig>  copies, there were indels of three or more bases. we defined this position as special variation position . six svps were identified . svp <dig> from copy flk-ple1gzl <dig> has an 11 bp deletions at nt ~ <dig>  in svp <dig>  the copies flk-ple1nc <dig>  flk-ple1nc <dig>  flk-ple1nc <dig> and flk-ple1sy <dig> have 2 bp deletions and 7 bp insertions at nt ~ <dig>  in svp <dig>  the copies flk-ple1jz <dig> and flk-ple1ls <dig> have 9 bp deletions at nt ~ <dig>  in svp <dig>  the copies flk-ple1gx <dig>  flk-ple1ys <dig> and flk-ple1gn <dig> have 7 bp insertions at nt ~ <dig>  in svp <dig>  the copies flk-ple1yj <dig>  flk-ple1yj <dig>  flk-ple1yj <dig> and flk-ple1lh <dig> have 9 bp deletions at nt ~ <dig>  three bases, acg, were found in only some ple <dig> copies particularly at nt ~ <dig> of svp <dig> figure  <dig>

among the  <dig> sequences,  <dig> sequences have a putative intact orf. these  <dig> sequences shared a high degree of sequence similarity. while, position nt ~ <dig>  in the 3′ region outside of the orf, showed the highest nucleotide variability between csuple <dig>  copies. this site, which we called the variation hotspot, contained a number of indels .

the variation rate  of the csuple <dig>  copies differed inside and outside the orf region. the variation rates inside the orf region and in the ple 5′ region outside the orf were significantly lower than the ple 3′ outside the orf region .table  <dig>

phylogenetic tree of c. suppressalis field populations
a mp phylogenetic tree and a upgma phylogenetic tree were constructed independently. in the mp phylogenetic tree, there were many clusters and the phylogenetic relationship between each was ambiguous . in the upgma tree, there were three clusters: jz, gy and xy formed one clade; yj, ls, jj and dy formed a second clade; and tc, sy, hx, gzl and yx formed a third clade .

discussion
since piggybac is one of the most popular transposons used for transgenesis, searching for new active ples has attracted lots of attention. however, only a few active ples have been reported to date, including ifp <dig>  uribo <dig>  mcrple and agople <dig>   <cit> . here we identified another potentially active ple. this ple has the intact structure of a piggybac transposon, including ttaa insertion sites, 13 bp itrs, 25 bp subterminal inverted repeats, and a single orf encoding a transposase of  <dig> amino acids with a perfect “ddd-motif”. the transposase was also shown to be transcriptionally active with a 1748 bp transcript cloned from c. suppressalis.

there was a high degree of sequence similarity in csuple1s from different field populations. all the tested populations shared two identical insertion sites, and each population also had their own unique insert sites. since all inactive copies of te will be fixed or lost in the population over time if they are neutral, insertion sites will become more homogeneous in populations over time  <cit> . our results therefore suggest that a few csuple <dig> copies in c. suppressalis may be functional and still moving. investigators have previously hypothesized that if tes with high sequence similarities could maintain their original structure in their hosts, then the invasion of the te was a recent event  <cit> . the high sequence similarities between csuple <dig> copies found in this study suggest that the invasion of csuple <dig> was a recent event.

the transposition activities of intact transposons are often regulated or silenced at the transcriptional, translational, or transpositional level for the survival of transposons and their hosts  <cit> . as a result, there are many transposable elements with mutations or variations within their host organisms  <cit> . sequence mutations may be randomly distributed in transposons. however our results indicate that the 3′ region outside the orf in the csuple <dig> transposons sequence had the highest variation rates. a variation hotspot was also found in this 3′ region. generally, regions with high numbers of mutation are the result of complex cellular processes including  interactions between dna and mutagens,  repair of premutational lesions,  local reduction in the fidelity of dna polymerization, and  expression and selection of a protein  molecule from which mutations have been detected  <cit> . this region is complex and deserves further study.

of the  <dig> insertion sites found, two occurred in all field populations and five occurred in multiple field populations. thus, these results imply that csuple <dig> existed in c. suppressalis prior to the expansion of the insect host populations into new regions. meng et al. stated that c. suppressalis had strong population structure with three genetic clusters, i.e. a central china  clade, a northern plus northeastern china  clade and a southwestern china  clade  <cit> . in these three clades, c. suppressalis had arisen from separate refuges and experienced parallel evolution. however, our results suggest that chinese c. suppressalis populations have a common ancestor. the research of retrotransposon ty3/gypsy in c. suppressalis shown that one insertion site of ty3/gypsy existed in all c. suppressalis filed populations  <cit> . this also supports our conclusion that c. suppressalis populations have a common ancestor in china.

the mp phylogenetic tree showed that many small clusters. this was due to the high sequence similarity. however, in the  <dig> csuple <dig>  copies, there were six svps. based on our results and meng et al.’s findings  <cit> , we conclude that the c. suppressalis populations of sy, gx, ys and gn belong to the central china  clade; and the c. suppressalis populations in jz and ls belong to the southwestern china  clade.

in the upgma phylogenetic tree, three clades were found. in the first clade, jz and xy come from similar geographic areas. however, they are far from gy population. in the second clade, ls, jj and dy come from the same geographic . yj belongs to coastal areas, with a similar temperature, humidity and seasonal temperature difference to the sichuan basin. in the third clade, tc and hx is close to each other and have similar environmental conditions. however, sy, gzl and yx are far from each other, and have different environments. this result is not entirely consistent with meng et al.’s result. this may be due to our small sample size or may be because our choice of method reveals a different phylogenetic relationship between c. suppressalis populations. our research indicated that the insertion sites were a candidate marker for phylogenetic research of c. suppressalis.

rice is the main host plant for c. suppressalis. gene flow in c. suppressalis follows a similar pattern to the expansion of rice domestication in china  <cit> . it has been suggested that the lower reaches of the yangtze river in china were the first rice farming region, although there are debates about the origin of rice  <cit> . meng et al. found gene flow of c. suppressalis in cc and sw regions tends to move west. in the cc region this is from ningbo towards regions such as quzhou, nangchang, and in the sw region, this is from liuzhou towards regions such as guiyang and yaan. in the nn region gene flow moves northward from wuhan or zhumadian to changchun  <cit> . these results together suggest that the lower reaches of the yangtze river are probably the original settlement of c. suppressalis in china. our results have shown that the csuple <dig>  insertion frequency was the highest in yx populations, located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river. moreover, the frequency of csuple <dig>  insertions decreases with increasing distance from yx. if the lower reaches of the yangtze river are the original settlement of c. suppressalis in china, we proposed that the csuple <dig>  invasion event initially occurred at the lower reaches of the yangtze river. as the transposition of transposons can help host organisms adapt, we suggest that the csuple <dig>  had more transpositional opportunities as c. suppressalis expanded into new areas and new environments. the csuple <dig>  insertion frequencies in clade a  were higher than in clade b  . this may be due to fewer c. suppressalis generations each year in clade a  compared to clade b  and therefore less opportunity for csuple <dig>  transposition in clade a. another reason for differences in insertion frequency could be differences in environmental stress. for example, the csuple <dig>  insertion frequency in fn population was lower than all other nearby populations . in fn, upland rice, which has lower nutrient levels than non-upland rice, was planted. our previous research showed that the average individual body weight of c. suppressalis in fn was lighter than other field population  <cit> . also, winters in fn are colder and drier than other nearby populations. c. suppressalis in fn therefore faces greater challenges to survive and such stress potentially provides more transpotition opportunity for the csuple <dig>  in this population.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
c. suppressalis occurs in all rice-growing areas in china, and they are non-migratory insects. based on our results, we suggest that c. suppressalis populations have a common ancestor in china. the initial invasion of csuple <dig> in c. suppressalis occurred before c. suppressalis populations spread throughout china, and the invasion of csuple <dig> transposons was a recent event. additionally, the lower reaches of the yangtze river are probably the original settlement of c. suppressalis in china. moreover, the insertion sites of csuple1s should be a candidate marker for the phylogenetic research of c. suppressalis.
