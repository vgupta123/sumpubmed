BACKGROUND
wheat  is a major staple food crop in several parts of the world, in terms of its cultivation area and use as a food source. increasing yield to meet the increasing global demand for the crop is the main goal of wheat production. one way to improve the wheat yield potential is to increase the grain number per spike and unit area  <cit> . for this purpose, wheat scientists have considered a wide range of genetic variations in the morphological structure of wheat to obtain high grain numbers per spike. these morphological variations include supernumerary spikelets, multi-spikelet  <cit> , and multi-row spikes  <cit> . peng  <cit>  selected a three-pistil  mutant with normal spike morphology that produced three pistils per floret. consequently, a floret could develop into three seeds, thereby increasing the seed number per spike. meanwhile, the novel pistillody mutant, hts- <dig>  was screened from chinese spring tp , which is a near-isogenic line of the common wheat variety chinese spring with the pis <dig> gene derived from the tp mutant  <cit> . hts- <dig> plants exhibit a novel phenotype that transforms all or parts of the stamen into pistils or pistil-like structures. in recent years, the alloplasmic lines n <dig>  <cit>  and -csdt7bs  <cit>  have been used to determine the genetic and molecular mechanisms of wheat pistillody  <cit> . nuclear-cytoplasm interaction  <cit>  causes pistillody in n <dig> and -csdt7bs. however, pistillody in hts- <dig> is caused by the interaction of the recessive karyogenes hts <dig> and hts <dig>  <cit> . therefore, hts- <dig> is genetically different from the previously reported lines -csdt7bs and n <dig>  wheat florets are considered extremely stable and have a few reported mutants. previous studies on floret mutants only provided a superficial understanding of floral organ identity determination in wheat plants. consequently, hts- <dig> is a significant genetic material to study the floral development of wheat; this line also has the potential to increase wheat yield.

compared with studies on the functions of single or few genes during flower development  <cit> , the underlying genetic determinants that control flower development have received relatively little attention in wheat. moreover, the genes and their corresponding expression patterns related to pistil and stamen development have yet to be reported. previous studies on expressed sequence tag sequences generated a large number of cdna sequences for the wheat trifldb database , which contains approximately  <dig>  full-length cdnas  <cit> . traditional sequencing methods have been used on randomly selected cdna clones from various tissues; however, these methods obtained a low coverage of less-abundant or rare transcripts, which usually have vital functions. a novel approach to transcriptome profiling, called rna sequencing  has been developed recently, this method is based on next-generation sequencing  technologies  <cit> . rna-seq has been widely applied in plant biology, particularly in model species, such as arabidopsis  <cit> , and crop plants, such as rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , and wheat  <cit> .

in the present study, we used rna-seq to investigate and compare the transcriptomes of pistillody stamen  and the pistil  from hts- <dig> plants, and of the stamen  from the non-pistillody control variety cstp. the results of this study provide insights into p and s development in wheat.

RESULTS
comparison of the morphological structures of ps, p, and s
peng et al.  <cit>  observed pistillody in hts- <dig>  hts- <dig> is a cstp sib-line that carries the pis <dig> gene. however, hts- <dig> plants exhibit different florets; i.e., some hts- <dig> stamens turn into pistils or a combination of stamens and pistils. as shown in figure 1-a, the anther-like structure bears a tuft of ‘stigma hair’ at the right. a normal pistil and stamen are shown in figure 1-b and 1-c. to compare the structures of ps, p, and s, each part was sectioned longitudinally and examined for histological modifications. the p showed well-developed ovules  and s contained normal pollen grains . ps  contained ovule-like structures and had a pistil-like form; however, the ovules were underdeveloped and sometimes contained deformed pollen grains .figure  <dig>

transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly
three cdna libraries  were constructed with the respective total rna from ps, p, and s., the prepared libraries were sequenced on an illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. a total of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> ,674 bp paired-end reads were obtained for ps, p, and s, respectively, which corresponded to a total size of  <dig>  gbp after low-quality reads and adapter sequences were removed . all paired-end reads were pooled together and assembled de novo using trinity   <cit> . finally, we obtained  <dig>  transcripts with lengths ≥200 bp. the mean length of these transcripts was  <dig>  bp, and the maximum length was  <dig>  bp . the transcripts were assembled into  <dig>  putative unigenes. the sequence information of all illumina reads was deposited in the national center for biotechnology information  under the accession number srp <dig>  the mean length of the putative unigenes was 695 bp. among all the putative unigenes,  <dig>  were longer than 1000 bp, which represented  <dig> % of the total . the size distribution of the assembly transcripts and unigenes is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the  <dig>  putative unigenes were aligned against the draft sequence of the bread wheat genome ;  <dig>  unigenes  could be mapped to the exon regions.table  <dig>

gene ontology  was employed to identify the functional categories of the annotated unigenes and to classify the transcripts with known annotated proteins.  <dig>  unigenes  had significant similarities to nr and pfam proteins and were assigned under go terms. in several cases, multiple terms were assigned to the same transcript. the analysis produced  <dig>  assignments to biological processes,  <dig>  to cellular components, and  <dig>  to molecular functions . most of the biological process categories were related to metabolic processes  and cellular processes . under the category of cellular components,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the unigenes were located in cell parts  and cells , respectively. among the molecular functions, the majority of the go terms were grouped into either binding  or catalytic activity .figure  <dig>

to further understand the biological functions and interactions of the gene products, a pathway-based analysis was conducted using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway database. kegg records the molecular interaction networks in cells with variants that are specific to particular organisms. unigenes with annotated nr and pfam proteins were mapped to the ko database using kobas   <cit> . the results showed that  <dig>  unigenes could be assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways for ps, p, and s transcriptomes . most unigenes of the  <dig> kegg pathways were ribosome pathways . glucosinolate biosynthesis, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, geraniol degradation, and polyketide sugar unit biosynthesis had the least number of unigenes .

differentially expressed genes  among ps, p, and s
the tag frequency differences that appeared in the ps, p, and s libraries were used to estimate the gene expression levels that corresponded to stamen and pistil development . the numbers of degs in ps vs. p, ps vs. s, and p vs. s were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, for transcripts detected with |log <dig> fold change| >  <dig> . a total of  <dig>  unigenes were identified as degs in at least two libraries. among these shared degs,  <dig>  common degs were found between ps vs. s and p vs. s, which may contribute to stamen and pistil development. the degs with |log <dig> fold change| >  <dig> are shown in figure 3b; at this level, ps vs. p, ps vs. s, and p vs. s had  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> degs, respectively. among the degs within this threshold,  <dig> degs were common in ps vs. s and p vs. s, including  <dig> upregulated genes and  <dig> downregulated genes . these  <dig> genes may have a high correlation with stamen and pistil development. ps vs. p had the least degs for |log <dig> fold change| >  <dig> or |log <dig> fold change| >  <dig>  with only  <dig> and  <dig> degs, respectively. this trend suggested that the ps and p have similar transcript profiles.figure  <dig>

functional annotation analysis of degs
the set of  <dig> common degs between ps vs. s and p vs. s was mapped in accordance with the go biological process database to understand the functions of these degs; the gene expression profiles were compared with the whole transcriptome background to identify the genes involved in important biological processes. after go term enrichment analysis,  <dig> genes among the common degs were assigned to at least one term in the go cellular component, molecular function, and biological process categories; these terms included  <dig> upregulated genes and  <dig> downregulated genes. transcripts from the three categories were further classified into  <dig> functional groups, which provided an overview of the ontology of each transcriptome . among the  <dig> functional groups, catalytic activity , metabolic process , and cellular process  were prominently represented. this result indicated that the three functional groups might be related to pistil and stamen development. at least seven unigenes with high percentage identity to known flower development genes from wheat, barley, and brachypodium distachyon , were identified by comparing the degs found in this study with the ncbi databases.figure  <dig>

discussion
low-cost and high-throughput ngs technologies, particularly rna-seq, have become useful, not only for de novo genome assembly, molecular marker development, and genome diversity studies, but also to discover novel genes and to investigate gene expression profiles  <cit> . in model species, transcriptome profiling and gene expression quantification are generally performed by mapping reads from the ngs analysis to a reference genome sequence and then annotating the selected genes. the strategies for model species are not feasible in wheat because the reference genome sequence and gene annotation of wheat remain incomplete. however, an international project to achieve these goals is currently under way . this project may take a considerable time because of the difficulties involved in sequencing the large , highly repetitive, hexaploid genome of wheat. for this reason, biological analyses of wheat based on ngs data are challenging. the present study used ngs technology for wheat rna-seq to characterize and compare the gene expression profiles among ps, p, and s to identify candidate genes related to pistil and stamen development.

in this study, illumina sequencing from wheat ps, p, and s produced  <dig>  putative unigenes, of which only  <dig>  unigenes  had at least one significant match with an existing gene models in blast searches . this result may be attributed to the absence of the completely sequenced genome for wheat.

common wheat  has a large genome  and a high proportion of repetitive sequences ; therefore, it is difficult to de novo assemble the hexaploid wheat transcriptome. oono et al.  <cit>  verified the three de novo assembly tools  by comparing analyses from several programs using short-read sequence data obtained from wheat cultivar cs seedlings grown under reduced phosphorus. their results indicated that trinity produced the largest number of contigs and the longest unigenes. in this study,  <dig>  unigenes, which were de novo assembled by trinity, were aligned against the draft sequence of the bread wheat genome , and  <dig> % unigenes could be mapped to the exonic regions. this result further justified the use of trinity to de novo assemble the hexaploid wheat transcriptome.

our analysis identified  <dig> degs, each with differences greater than five-fold, which were common in the comparisons of ps vs. s and p vs. s. we deduced that these  <dig> genes may be highly correlated with stamen and pistil development because the ps and p have similar morphological structure and transcript profiles. the steady-state transcript levels for  <dig> genes were confirmed by qrt-pcr. although the differences in gene expression based on qrt-pcr did not match the magnitude of those detected using rna-seq, the upregulation and downregulation trends were similar. the lower expression levels detected by qrt-pcr could reflect the different sensitivities between the two technologies  <cit> . illumina sequencing has been documented to be more sensitive for the estimation of gene expression, particularly for low-abundance transcripts, compared with microarrays and qrt-pcr  <cit> . among the  <dig> genes, at least seven unigenes were previously reported to influence flower development: mikc-type mads-box transcription factor wm27b , a dl related gene, yab <dig>  yabby  <dig>  wm <dig>  cer <dig>  and wblh <dig> 

the mads-box transcription factor, wm <dig>  belongs to the class d gene group and regulates ovule identity specification according to the “abcde” model in flower development  <cit> . in the present study, wm <dig> expression was upregulated in ps and p. this result is similar to the finding of paolacci et al.  <cit>  that taag- <dig> is highly expressed during late spike development, with weak expression in stamens, but high expression in pistils and caryopses. therefore, the result demonstrated that wm <dig> may be involved in pistil development.

yab <dig>  the dl related gene, and yabby  <dig> belong to the yabby gene family; their upregulated expressions were detected in ps and s. the genes of yabby family in arabidopsis determine the abaxial cell fate of lateral organs  <cit> . in rice, yab <dig> plays a major role in meristem development and causes extra stamens and carpels  <cit> . thus, yab <dig> may have an important function in wheat pistil and stamen development. yamaguchi et al.  <cit>  indicated that the dl gene in rice interacts antagonistically with class b genes and controls floral meristem determinacy. severe dl loss-of-function mutations caused the complete homeotic transformation of carpels into rice stamens. no literature has indicated that the yabby  <dig> gene is related to flower development. as a member of the yabby gene family, yabby  <dig> may have similar functions to other yabby proteins. moreover, the yabby  <dig> gene is upregulated in ps and p. thus, yabby  <dig> may contribute to pistil development.

previous studies have shown that the wheat meiosis  <dig>  gene is expressed in young flowers during meiosis, and encodes a novel protein that appears to be involved in meristem development, and flower and pollen formation  <cit> . according to dong et al.  <cit> , expression of the meiosis  <dig> gene may be upregulated in stamens. however, meiosis  <dig> showed upregulated expression in ps and p. thus, the function of meiosis  <dig> in pistil and stamen development remains unclear and needs further experimental verification.

the arabidopsis cer <dig> gene encodes a novel protein involved in the conversion of long chain aldehydes to alkanes, which is a key step in wax biosynthesis. the cer <dig> mutants, which are conditionally male sterile, display glossy green stems and fruit  <cit> . cer <dig> was downregulated in ps and p or upregulated in s. this result indicated that cer <dig> is involved in stamen development. this result agrees with that of aarts et al.  <cit> .

the unigene comp122918_c <dig> is homologous to the wheat bel <dig> gene wblh <dig>  plant bel1-like homeobox  genes form a small gene family that functions in various developmental aspects, such as seed shattering in rice  <cit> , or leaf shape establishment and ovule development in arabidopsis  <cit> . mizumoto et al.  <cit>  isolated four blh genes in wheat, designated wblh <dig> to wblh <dig>  expression analysis indicated that the wblh <dig> gene is not related to ovule development. in the present study, the wblh <dig> gene was downregulated in ps and p . this result agrees with the finding of mizumoto et al.,  <cit> . therefore, we speculated that wblh <dig> has an important function in stamen development. in addition to the seven unigenes, the other  <dig> genes probably also contribute to stamen and pistil development. however, further research is required to determine the mechanisms by which these genes control wheat stamen and pistil development.

CONCLUSIONS
we sequenced and characterized the transcriptome of wheat ps, p from hts- <dig> plants and s from the non-pistillody control cstp. the use of this transcriptome resource enabled us to characterize gene expression profiles, examine differential expression profiles, and identify functional genes related to wheat stamen and pistil development. this work is significant for the development of genomic resources for wheat and provides important insights into the molecular mechanisms of wheat stamen and pistil development.
