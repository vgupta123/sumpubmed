BACKGROUND
basement membranes play an important role in tissue development and maintenance including mechanical stability, formation of barriers between different cell types and promotion of cell adhesion, migration, growth and differentiation. laminins are large glycoprotein heterotrimers that are found as major components of basement membranes in almost every animal tissue. to date, five alpha, four beta, and three gamma precursors have been identified that can combine to form fifteen laminin isoforms with different tissue distribution  <cit> . mutations in laminin genes have been identified in several human disorders: muscular dystrophy , epidermolysis bullosa and laryngo-onycho-cutaneous syndrome .

laminin- <dig>  which is composed of alpha- <dig>  beta- <dig> and gamma- <dig> chains, was first described by timpl and co-authors in  <dig>  <cit> . laminin- <dig> shows restricted expression that is largely limited to epithelial basement membranes. laminin- <dig> is detected in most embryonic tissues during early morphogenesis and remains present as a major epithelial laminin in some adult tissues  <cit> . mice that are deficient in any chain that composes laminin- <dig>  die during the early postimplantation period with the lama1-/- phenotype being the mildest of the three genes deleted  <cit> . this finding could be explained by the fact that β <dig> and γ <dig> proteins participate in multiple heterotrimers and therefore have broader functions than α <dig> chain that is restricted to two laminins. other animal models of laminin- <dig> deficiency include zebrafish grumpy  and sleepy  mutants that were identified in a genome-wide chemical mutagenesis screen  <cit>  and lamb <dig> and lamc <dig>  mutants produced by retrovirus-mediated insertional mutagenesis  <cit> . the zebrafish laminin β <dig> and γ <dig> mutants display shortened body axes due to a failure of notochord differentiation as well as complex ocular defects . to date, there are no distinct human phenotypes associated with laminin- <dig> mutations although some studies suggested a potential involvement of lamb <dig> in a neonatal cutis laxa with a marfan phenotype  <cit>  and lamc <dig> in a junctional epidermolysis bullosa inversa  <cit> .

the laminin alpha- <dig> gene shows a tissue-restricted expression pattern and is considered to be the most specific of the classical laminins. expression of lama <dig> is detected in the nervous and urogenital systems, pre-somitic mesoderm, some brain blood vessels and in the embryonic and mature lens . the important role of laminins/extracellular matrix/basement membranes in eye development and in an adult ocular function has been discussed in several reports  <cit>  but the specific roles of different laminin subunits are only beginning to be elucidated.

besides laminin- <dig> , laminin alpha- <dig> participates in one additional trimer, laminin- <dig>   <cit> . interestingly, except for lama <dig>  all other components of either laminin- <dig> or - <dig> were found to be involved in ocular developmental phenotypes. human lamb <dig> mutations result in a complex phenotype that includes such ocular manifestations as microcoria, lenticonus, rieger anomaly, glaucoma, cataracts and microphthalmia  <cit> . mutations in laminin β <dig> and γ <dig> genes result in multiple eye anomalies in zebrafish: retinal blowout   <cit> , disorganized optic nerves  <cit> , some retinal lamination defects  <cit>  and lens hypoplasia, lens capsule rupture and corneal defects  <cit> . as laminin alpha  <dig> contributes to both laminins, lama <dig> mutations are likely to result in similar eye defects and may even cause more severe and/or complex ocular phenotypes due to the cumulative effect of laminin- <dig> and - <dig> deficiencies.

zebrafish represents a valuable vertebrate model to study developmental processes. in this report, we present identification and characterization of the zebrafish laminin alpha  <dig> gene including its sequence, expression pattern, and loss-of-function phenotype.

RESULTS
cloning of zebrafish lama <dig> gene
in order to identify the zebrafish laminin alpha  <dig> gene, we first performed a search for homologous sequences using the known human and mouse laminin α <dig> sequences, zebrafish genomic database   <cit>  and blast engine. this approach identified ten sequences homologous to the human lama <dig> gene with the most upstream sequence corresponding to exon  <dig> and the most downstream one- to exon  <dig> of the human lama <dig> gene ). the identified sequences were used to design specific oligonucleotides that were then utilized in rt-pcr reactions using rna isolated from 48-hpf danio rerio embryos; the resultant pcr products were separated by electrophoresis, cloned into a plasmid vector and subjected to dna sequencing. to identify the full-length lama <dig> transcript, we performed 5'- and 3' race reactions and determined sequences for the corresponding products of these reactions. the obtained sequences were arranged into a contiguous assembly and analyzed using vector nti™ sequence analysis software.

the lama <dig> cdna contig comprised 9581-bp and contained a 9225-bp open reading frame that was predicted to encode  <dig> amino acid protein , 128-bp of 5'utr and 228-bp of 3'utr sequence . detailed analysis of the 5' sequence identified five initiator codon trinucleotides  in the 24-bp region spanning nucleotides 128- <dig>  among these potential translational start sites, the second atg appears to have the most favorable surrounding sequence gcgatgatgg with four nucleotides  being consistent with the kozak's consensus sequence identified for vertebrate genomes  <cit> . as the translational site "context" sequence is not exclusive at any positions and some sites were found to be occupied by non-conserved nucleotides in all five sequences, we selected the most upstream atg codon as a translational start site for the lama <dig> protein.

the overall sequence demonstrated strong homology with laminin genes/proteins of the alpha family that were shown to be highly homologous to each other. in order to position the novel zebrafish gene within the alpha laminin family, we performed a phylogenetic tree calculation using the corresponding module of vector nti™ suite. this algorithm is based on a sequence distance method and utilizes the neighbor joining formula of saitou and nei  <cit> . this analysis demonstrated grouping of the novel transcript with the laminin alpha  <dig> sequences from other species . the comparison of human, mouse and zebrafish laminin α <dig> amino acid sequences showed high identity level throughout the entire protein . based on blast analysis results, the overall zebrafish lama <dig> sequence demonstrated ~51% identity with human, mouse and chicken laminin α <dig>  and ~42% identity- with human and mouse laminin α <dig> proteins. the laminin alpha  <dig> contains several conserved domains: short signal peptide , n-terminal region , seventeen laminin egf-like domains and two laminin iv type a <dig> domains , and five laminin g-like domains  . the n-terminal domain demonstrated the highest level of conservation  while the identity level in other domains varied from ~30% to 75%. the central region of the laminin alpha  <dig> protein encompassing amino acids 1555- <dig>  demonstrated the lowest level of conservation at ~30% . the zebrafish lama <dig> nucleotide and protein sequences were submitted to genbank with accession number dq <dig> 

identification of genomic structure of the lama <dig> gene
genomic sequences of the lama <dig> gene were identified either by sequence similarity search using cdna sequences, blast engine and public databases  or by direct sequencing of products generated by long-range pcr using exonic primers and genomic dna. the gene was found to consist of sixty-three exons ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length. overall, the genomic structure of the zebrafish laminin alpha  <dig> gene corresponded well with the human lama1; all the donor and acceptor splicing sites contained characteristic consensus sequences conserved in vertebrates .

embryonic expression of zebrafish lama1
embryonic expression of the zebrafish lama <dig> gene was studied by rt-pcr and in situ hybridization. embryos ranging from the 16-32-cell stage to 120-hpf, as well as different adult tissues were examined for the presence of the lama <dig> transcript. expression of lama <dig> was strong during embryonic development and depleted in most adult tissues, which is consistent with the previously reported data . first lama <dig> transcripts were detected in 3- <dig> hpf embryos  and expression continued at later embryonic and larval stages of development . in adult fish, expression was observed in the eye.

we also tested expression of an additional laminin transcript, lama2-like. the lama <dig> and lama <dig> proteins are highly homologous to each other and were shown to be functionally redundant  <cit> . the lama1& <dig> genes are expressed in separate as well as overlapping domains during development including ocular tissues  <cit> . the 1776-bp lama2-like sequence was identified from genbank  and demonstrated 61% identity with the human lama <dig> at amino acid level. expression of zebrafish lama2-like gene was tested by rt-pcr with gene-specific primers. based on rt-pcr results, lama <dig> expression is detectable starting from 24-hpf embryos  to 84-hpf larvae and was not found in adult tissues. the lama <dig> and other, not yet identified, zebrafish alpha transcripts are likely to be able to substitute for laminin alpha  <dig> and each other during embryonic development. identification and characterization of these genes is necessary to better understand multiple roles of different laminin isoforms during development.

whole mount in situ hybridization was performed using embryos at 24-, 48-, 72-, and 96-hpf and a 590-bp antisense riboprobe that comprised lama <dig> sequence corresponding to nucleotide positions 287- <dig> . expression of lama <dig> was detected in the developing lens, sclera, midbrain, somites, urogenital system and notochord , which is consistent with the lama <dig> gene expression in other species.

morpholino-mediated knockdown of zebrafish laminin alpha  <dig> expression
to examine the functions of laminin alpha  <dig> during embryonic development, we injected lama1-specific and control oligonucleotides into 1- <dig> cell stage embryos. the lama <dig> morpholinos were designed to hybridize to the 5' sequence of the laminin alpha  <dig> mrna near the initiation codon : mo <dig> oligomer corresponds to sequence from nucleotide - <dig> to - <dig> while mo <dig> morpholino matches sequence between nucleotides at positions - <dig> and + <dig> 

the morphological phenotype in the morpholino-injected embryos was first detected in 36-hpf embryos and became highly evident by 72-hpf. the morphants exhibited a shortened body, an abnormal body axis curvature, and malformed eyes that often lacked lenses and had misshapen pupils . the percentage of morphants exhibiting the phenotype positively correlated with the concentration of the injected morpholinos and ranged from 30%  to 60% for mo <dig> oligomer  or 50% for mo <dig> . the rate of early lethality by 24-hpf ranged from 7%  to 23% for mo <dig>  or 31% for mo <dig> oligomer . in control experiments, zebrafish embryos that were injected with control morpholinos as well as uninjected larvae were examined for morphological phenotypes. both groups demonstrated phenotypes indistinguishable from the wild-type fish with a lethality rate of ~10% level for un-injected larvae and embryos that were injected at c =  <dig>  mm; embryos that were injected at c =  <dig>  mm demonstrated 21% lethality.

to determine ocular defects in the lama1-morphants, we compared the histology of the lama <dig> morphant eyes to wild-type in embryos ranging from 18-hpf to 72-hpf . since morphant fish produced by injections with either mo <dig> or mo <dig> oligomers demonstrated similar phenotypes based on visual examination, only mo1- injected morphants have been used for further histological analysis. for 48-hpf and 72-hpf stages, embryos with abnormal phenotype were selected; while for the 18-, 24- and 32- hpf time points, twelve mo1-oligomer- injected living embryos were collected before the phenotype is evident and eight  of these animals were expected to be morphants . the stages of the establishment of the lens placode, lens delamination from the ectoderm and formation of the lens vesicle appear to be grossly normal in lama- <dig> deficient embryos. the cells of the lens vesicle seem to be slightly disorganized in about 20% of 24-32-hpf embryos , which is below the estimated frequency of morphant embryos in this sample. therefore, we concluded that formation of the lens vesicle appears to be mostly unaffected in lama- <dig> morphants. in the 48-hpf morphant eyes, a small lens vesicle remnant was found and it was surrounded by degenerating lens tissue. in the 72-hpf morphants, the lens was absent and lenticular bladder cells seem to form a deposit in subretinal space in some embryos . in normal 72-hpf animals, the following main ocular tissues can easily be detected: 1) laminated retina containing the photoreceptor, inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers; 2) lens that consists of a single layer of epithelial cells and mainly differentiated lens fibers and 3) cornea with three easily observed layers- surface epithelium, a thin lamellar stroma that is contiguous with sclera and flattened endothelial cells  <cit> . in addition to lens degradation, the eye sections obtained from 72-hpf lama <dig> morphant embryos revealed different degrees of thickened cornea and reduced eye size . at the same time, the retina and the optic nerve are present and appear to be grossly normal in the lama1-knockdown fish.

discussion
in this paper, we report identification of the zebrafish laminin alpha  <dig> gene and analysis of its role during embryonic development by means of expression and knockdown studies. our data indicate a strong conservation of lama <dig> function during vertebrate development as both the predicted protein sequence and expression pattern of this gene were found to be highly conserved between zebrafish and other species. the highest level of conservation was identified in the n-terminal domain of lama <dig> followed by the laminin globular  domains. the n-terminal domain was shown to be involved in laminin polymerization in vitro  <cit> , and binding to integrins α1β <dig> and α1β <dig>  <cit> . the five laminin globular domains located in the c-terminus represent the main cell-adhesive sites and bind the major laminin receptor integrin α6β <dig> as well as α6β <dig> and α7β <dig>  <cit> , extracellular heparan proteoglycan perlecan, dystroglycan, sulfatides and heparin  <cit> ; mice lacking the alpha  <dig> chain lg4- <dig> module were reported to die at e <dig>  with failure of epiblast differentiation  <cit> . preservation of the n-terminal and c-terminal domain sequences throughout vertebrate evolution suggests that the interactions mediated by these regions are of particular importance.

the zebrafish lama <dig> gene was found to be strongly expressed during embryonic development. the following high-expression sites were identified in the developing embryo: lens, brain, somites, urogenital system, and notochord. this pattern is consistent with distribution of lama <dig> transcripts in other species  and suggests a high degree of conservation in laminin alpha  <dig> function during embryonic development in vertebrates. the evolutionarily conserved expression of lama <dig> is likely to be governed by a network of specific regulatory elements maintained in phylogenetically divergent species. identification of cis-regulatory regions and trans-acting factors that direct the specific lama <dig> expression pattern will provide important insight into mechanisms of embryonic development and ocular tissue maintenance.

knockdown of the laminin alpha  <dig> expression in zebrafish resulted in a distinct phenotype characterized by anomalies in eye development as well as body axis length and curvature. this condition is different from the phenotype reported in lama1-/- knockout mice  <cit> . the lama-/- null mice die prenatally around day  <dig> post coitus  while the embryos that are deficient in either β <dig> or γ <dig> laminin chains do not survive past day  <dig>  pc, which is the blastula stages in mice  <cit> . the laminin- <dig> is first detected around the 16-cell stage in mice and present in the two basement membranes formed before gastrulation. mammalian embryos deficient in any component of laminin- <dig>  survive implantation but die before gastrulation indicating to the critical role of laminin- <dig> in this process  <cit> . in zebrafish, implantation does not occur as embryogenesis occurs ex utero. gastrulation does not seem to require laminin- <dig> in zebrafish as both lamb1- and lamc1-mutants undergo normal germ-layer patterning and gastrulation movements  <cit> . this phenomenon may be explained by a compensation from another laminin or differences in mechanisms between fish and mammals. identification and studies of all other zebrafish laminin isoforms are necessary to clarify this issue.

the ocular phenotype in zebrafish embryos deficient in laminin alpha  <dig> is characterized by slightly smaller eyes with visible anomalies in lens and cornea development. a primary defect may be the lens degeneration due to developmental arrest that causes collapse of the surrounding ocular tissue  and abnormal patterning of the anterior segment structures . similar associations between lens defects, small eye and malformed anterior chamber have been previously reported  <cit> . at the same time, the visible corneal defects may indicate a discrete function of lama <dig> in the development of the anterior segment structures.

the severe ocular phenotype observed in the lama1-deficient fish embryos reveals a new role for this molecule during vertebrate embryonic development. the observed lama1- knockdown phenotype is consistent with the ocular abnormalities associated with other laminins such as lamb <dig> and lamc <dig> in zebrafish and lamb <dig> in humans . interestingly, all these proteins are involved in the only two trimers that laminin alpha  <dig> was found to be a part of: laminin- <dig>  and laminin- <dig> . the lamb <dig> and lamc <dig> proteins are widely expressed in different species and can associate with any alpha laminin. mutations in lamb <dig> and lamc <dig> in zebrafish result in complex phenotypes that include lens hypoplasia, lens capsule rupture and corneal defects  <cit> . the laminin- <dig> was originally identified in human placenta  <cit>  but lamb <dig> mrna has also been detected in lens, corneal, pigment epithelial and hyaloid cells during development  <cit> . clear evidence of an important role of beta- <dig> and its complexes in human ocular development was provided by the discovery of lamb <dig> mutations in human patients affected with complex ocular phenotypes that include lens, iris, corneal, retinal and overall eye-size defects  <cit> . the exact role of laminin- <dig> and - <dig> during vertebrate eye development require further investigation. identification and functional analysis of zebrafish lamb <dig> may provide an important insight into this issue.

there are several ocular phenotypes that involve lens degeneration including aphakia  <cit> , dysgenetic lens  <cit> , lens aplasia  <cit>  in mice. genes responsible for the aphakia and dysgenetic lens phenotypes have been identified as transcription factors, pitx <dig> and foxe3; both genes were also shown to be involved in human ocular disorders involving abnormal lens, iris and corneal development  <cit>  and zebrafish pitx3-morphants displayed lens degeneration similar to mammals  <cit> . defects in the basement membrane and/or extracellular matrix were reported in aphakia and lens aplasia mutants  <cit>  indicating a possible connection with the laminin and/or other extracellular matrix molecule pathway that needs to be further investigated.

the lens is surrounded by the lens capsule that represents a thick basement membrane that includes laminins, collagen iv, heparan sulfate proteoglycans , nidogen and fibronectin. the other components, such as type xv and type xviii collagen, agrin, fibulins and growth factors, may be present at some stages as well. the importance of the extracellular matrix/basement membrane for lens development was proposed based on the distinctive spatio-temporal expression patterns of different extracellular matrix proteins during lens development  <cit> , changes in the distribution of the extracellular matrix proteins during normal and aberrant lens development  <cit>  as well as human and animal phenotypes associated with mutations in ecm component genes that, in addition to the above discussed, include perlecan  <cit>  and collagen xviii  <cit> .

based on the phenotype observed in zebrafish, mutations in the laminin- <dig> components are likely to contribute to human disorders of the lens  and/or anterior segment development . also, because the lens plays an important role in normal ocular growth, defects in lens development may also play a role in another common ocular disease- myopia  <cit> . this possibility is further supported by the fact that the messenger rna for lama <dig> was detected in the developing sclera in addition to the lens in zebrafish; sclera cell development has been shown to be important for the normal eye growth in several studies  <cit> . in humans, lama <dig> maps to the 18p <dig>  region that contains a gene for high-grade myopia . the affected individuals were characterized by an average spherical component refractive error of - <dig>  diopters and an average age at diagnosis of myopia of  <dig>  years; no clinical evidence of connective tissue abnormalities has been noted . because of the essential role of laminin- <dig> in governing early events in mammalian development, human laminin- <dig> mutations in ocular phenotypes, if any, are most likely to be detected in a heterozygous state and/or to be specific to the particular interactions involved in eye development and maintenance. the expression pattern of lama <dig> in human ocular tissues needs to be determined and the potential contribution of this gene in ocular disease should be examined.

CONCLUSIONS
the laminin alpha  <dig> gene was found to play an important role in ocular development in zebrafish. given that lama <dig> was shown to be expressed in eye tissues in mammals as well, this gene is likely to have a similar role in these higher species. additional studies into the specific role of laminin- <dig> and laminin- <dig> during eye development are necessary. the findings can then be correlated with specific human phenotypes to identify mutations that may impair different regions of this complex molecule.
