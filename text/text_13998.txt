BACKGROUND
human rhinovirus is a positive sense, single-strand rna virus from the picornavirus family. it causes the majority of colds, and it also triggers exacerbations of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis  <cit> . more than  <dig> strains of hrv have been identified, and these have been classified into three species  based on genome sequencing data  <cit> . airway epithelial cells are the primary site for rhinovirus infection and replication. depending on the serotype of hrv, cell entry is mediated by binding to the receptors icam- <dig> , low-density-lipoprotein receptor family members , or cadherin-related family member  <dig>   <cit> .

host responses to hrv are thought to be initiated when viral proteins and nucleic acids trigger pathogen recognition receptors  of the innate immune system  . prr signaling triggers intracellular signaling cascades that converge on the irf and nf-κb family of transcription factors, which in turn activate interferon-induced antiviral and proinflammatory gene expression programs respectively. in epithelial cells, interferon programs are mainly activated via tlr <dig>  mda <dig>  and rig-i signaling . irf <dig> plays a central role in the activation of innate antiviral responses by controlling the transcription of type i and iii interferon genes  <cit> . type i interferon signaling in turn upregulates irf <dig> expression, thereby providing positive feedback amplification of the antiviral response  <cit> . the interferon system plays a crucial role in antiviral defence by upregulating a set of effector molecules , which induce a robust antiviral state in infected and neighbouring cells preventing the spread of infection  <cit> . the importance of irf <dig> in antiviral immunity was clearly demonstrated in irf <dig> deficient mice, which are highly susceptible to viral infections  <cit> . recent data in humans indicates that null mutations in irf <dig> are associated with susceptibility to severe, life-threatening influenza  <cit> .

although it is well established that irf <dig> is a master regulator of the antiviral response, the function  of irf <dig> can vary markedly depending on the cell type and the virus  <cit> . we reported that expression of irf <dig> was upregulated in nasal epithelial scrapings from human adults after experimental infection with hrv- <dig>  <cit> . employing a computational analysis of gene expression profiling data derived from nasal wash samples, we also showed that irf <dig> was a major hub, connecting interferon-related gene networks during picornavirus-induced asthma exacerbations in children  <cit> . lewis et al. reported that expression of irf <dig> was upregulated in nasal aspirates from asthmatic children during natural colds  <cit> . notably, all of the above studies focused on expression levels of irf7; this is the first study to perform gene silencing experiments in hbe to elucidate the role of irf <dig> in the regulation of hrv responses.

after stimulation, cells were washed with hbss and then scraped in lysis buffer . lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min, frozen at −80 °c, thawed, sonicated, and centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 5 min at 4 °c. protein concentrations for the triton x-100-soluble lysates were quantified using a dc protein assay . equivalent amounts of protein were separated by sds-page, and proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. membranes were blocked with 5 % skim milk for 1 h and probed with either 1 μg/ml of the irf <dig> antibody or a 1: <dig> dilution of the viperin antibody overnight at 4 °c. membranes were washed and then incubated for 1 h with a 1: <dig>  dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse ig antibody . proteins were visualized with a pierce ecl substrate reagent . equal loading was further determined probing with an antibody against gapdh.

gene expression profiling
total rna samples were shipped on dry ice to expression analysis inc. . purified rna was quantified using a nanodrop spectrophotometer and quality was determined using the agilent   <dig> lab-on-a-chip system. the rna samples were processed using the enzo single round rna amplification and biotin labeling system , and hybridized to primeview microarrays . the raw microarray data is available at the gene expression omnibus repository under accession gse <dig>

RESULTS
rhinovirus-induced gene expression patterns in human bronchial epithelial  cells
primary hbe cells from  <dig> donors were transfected with sirna that targets irf <dig> or a non-silencing sirna control . the hbe cells were allowed to recover for 24 h, and then they were exposed to hrv or medium control for another 24 h. as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  hrv induced the expression of irf <dig> protein in hbe cells that were transfected with control reagents , but not in hbe cells that were transfected with sirna reagents that target irf <dig> . of note, irf <dig> protein was not induced by the all-star control sirna in hbe cells in the absence of hrv exposure.fig.  <dig> knockdown of irf <dig> protein in hbe cells. hbe cells were transfected with the transfection reagent only , the all-star control sirna , or two independent sirnas that target irf <dig> . the cells were allowed to recover, and then exposed to hrv. protein expression was measured by western blot. data are representative of n = 4



next, global patterns of gene expression were profiled on microarrays. initially, we analyzed the data pertaining to the response to hrv in hbe cells transfected with the all-star control. as illustrated in fig.  <dig>   <dig> genes were upregulated in the response and  <dig> genes were downregulated  <  <dig> , additional file 1). the biological function of the differentially expressed genes was interrogated using innatedb. the data showed the upregulated genes were mainly involved in type i and ii interferon signaling, rig-i/mda <dig> signaling, antigen processing and presentation, and apoptosis . the downregulated genes were not strongly enriched for immune-related pathways, therefore we utilized the gene ontology  database to interrogate their function. this analysis showed that the downregulated genes were enriched with the go biological process term epithelial development .fig.  <dig> gene expression patterns in hrv-induced hbe cells. hbe cells from  <dig> donors were transfected with a non-silencing sirna , allowed to recover, and then cultured in the presence or absence of hrv for 24 h. gene expression was profiled on microarrays. the dashed horizontal line indicates fdr <  <dig> 



irf <dig> is a putative molecular driver of interferon-induced gene networks
upstream regulator analysis was employed to infer the molecular drivers that give rise to hrv-induced gene expression patterns in hbe cells   <cit> . in this analysis, the differentially expressed genes from fig.  <dig> were tested for enrichment of downstream target genes of known transcriptional regulators and other signal transduction pathways. as illustrated in table  <dig>  the most significant candidate drivers were ifng, ifna <dig>  irf <dig>  tnf, and ifnl <dig>  notably, irf <dig> was the only driver amongst these candidates that was also upregulated in the response . to illustrate the role of irf <dig> in the regulation of hrv responses, we utilized experimentally supported findings from the ingenuity systems database to reconstruct the irf <dig> network  <cit> . the resulting network is shown in fig.  <dig> table  <dig> identification of molecular drivers of gene expression patterns in hrv-induced hbe cells

fig.  <dig> irf <dig> is a putative molecular driver of hbe responses to hrv. differentially expressed genes were identified in hrv-induced hbe cells , and then the wiring diagram of the irf <dig> gene network was reconstructed from these data employing experimentally supported findings from published studies. solid and dashed lines indicate direct and indirect interactions respectively. genes colored red were upregulated in the response and genes colored green were downregulated



knockdown of irf <dig> perturbs hbe responses to rhinovirus
we next examined the impact of irf <dig> knockdown on the hrv response. gene expression patterns were compared between hrv-induced hbe cells transfected with irf7-sirna # <dig> versus the all-star control. the data showed that knockdown of irf <dig> resulted in decreased expression of  <dig> genes, and increased expression of  <dig> genes . the downregulated genes were mainly involved in type i and ii interferon signaling, toll-like receptor signaling, nod-like receptor signaling, and rig-i/mda <dig> signaling . as a supplementary analysis, we also examined the function of the downregulated genes after removal of known irf <dig> target genes. these residual genes were associated with nod-like receptor signaling pathways, trafficking of connexons, and metabolic pathways . the upregulated genes were involved in the response to oxidative stress  and inflammation , although it is noteworthy that these findings were not significant after adjustment of the p-values for multiple testing.fig.  <dig> knockdown of irf <dig> perturbs hbe cells responses to hrv. hbe cells from five donors were transfected with sirna that targets irf <dig>  or the non-silencing all-star control, allowed to recover, and then exposed to hrv for 24 h. gene expression was profiled on microarrays. the data was compared between hrv-induced cells treated with irf7-sirna # <dig> versus the all-star control. genes with negative values on the horizontal axis were decreased by irf <dig> knockdown, whereas those with positive values were increased. the black triangles show the location of genes from the irf <dig> network. the dashed horizontal line indicates fdr <  <dig> 



we next wanted to investigate the part of the hrv response that was insensitive to irf <dig> knockdown. in hbe cells that were transfected with the all-star control sirna,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed after hrv exposure, but only  <dig> of these genes  were sensitive to irf <dig> knockdown . moreover, the irf <dig> gene network depicted in fig.  <dig> contained  <dig> genes, and only  <dig> of these  were sensitive to irf <dig> knockdown . we analyzed these hrv responsive genes that were insensitive to irf <dig> knockdown using upstream regulator analysis. the data showed the highest ranking candidate transcription factors driving this response were nf-κb, stat <dig>  stat <dig>  and irf <dig> .fig.  <dig> most hrv responsive genes were insensitive to irf <dig> knockdown. venn diagram illustrating the overlap between those genes that were modulated by hrv  versus those that were sensitive to irf <dig> knockdown 



validation of the microarray findings
to confirm the findings from the microarray experiment, a subset of genes were selected for validation at the mrna and/or protein levels. as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  reverse transcription quantitative pcr  analysis demonstrated that knockdown of irf <dig> in hbe cells followed by exposure to hrv resulted in reduced expression of ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  herc <dig>  il- <dig>  rsad <dig> , and increased expression of cxcl <dig>  and this was consistent with the microarray data . expression levels of ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and viperin were also examined at the protein level . these data confirmed that the mrna expression changes observed upon sirna knockdown were associated with parallel changes at the protein level, although these changes were more pronounced with sirna # <dig> than with sirna # <dig> fig.  <dig> validation of the microarray data at the mrna level. hbe cells were transfected with the all-star control sirna, or two independent sirna reagents that target irf <dig> . the cells were allowed to recover, and then exposed to hrv for 24 h. gene expression levels were measured by real time rt-qpcr. the data for sirna # <dig> and sirna # <dig> are expressed as percent mrna response relative to the all-star control. data are mean ± sem from  <dig> experiments. asterisks show significant differences compared to the all star control sirna treatment. hashmarks  indicate significant differences between sirna# <dig> and sirna#2

discussion
irf <dig> is a master regulator of type i interferon gene expression and antiviral immunity, but the role of irf <dig> in hbe responses to hrv has not been previously investigated. employing microarray profiling we showed that hundreds of genes were upregulated in hbe upon hrv infection. upstream regulator analysis  <cit>  suggested that irf <dig> was a major molecular driver of this response. we then showed that knockdown of irf <dig> in hbe altered hrv responses, by decreasing the upregulation of genes involved in type i and ii interferon signaling and innate immunity , and increasing the expression of genes that promote inflammation  and the response to oxidative stress. we validated a subset of the differentially regulated genes  at the mrna and/or protein levels, thus confirming the findings from the microarray experiment. the data also showed that only around 30 % of the hrv responsive genes and half of known irf <dig> target genes were sensitive to irf <dig> knockdown, and these genes exhibited modest fold changes in our experiments , suggesting that other transcription factors are likely to be important in the regulation of interferon gene expression programs in hbe cells. upstream regulator analysis of the part of the hrv response that was insensitive to irf <dig> knockdown suggested roles for nf-κb, stat <dig>  stat <dig>  and irf <dig> in the regulation of the response. overall, our findings demonstrate that irf <dig> regulates the expression of genes involved in antiviral immunity, inflammation, and the response to oxidative stress in hbe cells during hrv infections, and also suggest that additional transcription factors play a major role in the regulation of this response.

we showed that the upregulation of ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  herc <dig>  il- <dig>  and rsad <dig> by hrv was reduced by irf <dig> knockdown in hbe cells. regulation of these genes by irf <dig> has been previously reported in other contexts . ccl <dig>  is a potent chemoattractant for t cells, monocytes, and eosinophils. ccl <dig> was upregulated in nasal wash samples from wheezing, hrv-infected infants in comparison to their nonwheezing counterparts  <cit> . cxcl <dig> is chemotactic for t cells and natural killer cells, and was strongly upregulated in airway epithelial cells during hrv infections  <cit> . cxcl <dig> promotes airways inflammation and airways hyperresponsiveness in mouse models of asthma  <cit> . herc <dig> is an e <dig> protein ligase that mediates isgylation of protein targets. it catalyzes the conjugation of isg <dig> onto irf <dig>  which inhibits the ubiquitination and degradation of irf <dig> by preventing irf <dig> from interacting with pin <dig>  this results in the sustained activation of irf <dig> and the antiviral response  <cit> . il- <dig> promotes the acute phase response, stimulates t cell responses and antibody production, and it is increased during symptomatic rhinovirus infections  <cit> . irf <dig> was required for il- <dig> production by poly  stimulated thp- <dig> monocytes  <cit> . in contrast, irf <dig> was dispensable for il- <dig> production in plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells stimulated by tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> ligands  <cit> . viperin  is an antiviral protein that can inhibit influenza budding from the plasma membrane by interfering with lipid rafts  <cit> . knockdown of viperin in airway epithelial cells increased hrv replication  <cit> . it is not possible to determine from our experiments if irf <dig> regulates hrv-induced airway inflammatory responses in vivo, however, girkin et al. showed that intranasal delivery of sirna that targets irf <dig> reduced the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of non-allergic mice after hrv-1b infection  <cit> . taken together, these studies suggest that irf <dig> regulates hrv-induced gene network patterns and ensuing cellular immune responses in the airways.

in contrast to genes involved in antiviral defense, knockdown of irf <dig> resulted in increased expression of cxcl <dig>  il- <dig>  and il1rl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  is important for neutrophil homeostasis and recruitment to the lung during infections  <cit> . il- <dig> is a nuclear-associated alarmin expressed in the airway epithelium. it signals through the st <dig> receptor , which is highly expressed on t-helper type  <dig>  lymphocytes and group  <dig> innate lymphoid cells   <cit> . il- <dig> is upregulated in the airways during hrv-induced asthma exacerbations  <cit> . moreover, supernatants from hrv-infected epithelial cells stimulate the production of th <dig> cytokines by th <dig> and ilc <dig> cells in an il- <dig> dependant manner  <cit> . irf <dig> binds to the il- <dig> promoter and regulates il- <dig> transcription in human monocyte thp- <dig> cell lines  <cit> . given that il- <dig> is a potent driver of asthmatic ilc <dig> and th <dig> responses, and we found that knockdown of irf <dig> results in upregulation of il- <dig>  this suggests the hypothesis that promoting irf <dig> responses during asthma exacerbations may have a dual beneficial effect of increasing antiviral immunity and supressing il- <dig> responses.

knockdown of irf <dig> decreased expression of genes involved in nod-like receptor signaling, and increased expression of genes involved in the response to oxidative stress , nadh:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase  <dig> , alpha-synuclein , short transient receptor potential channel  <dig> ) . in this context it is noteworthy that the generation of reactive oxygen species during hrv infection compromises epithelial barrier function, and this can lead to secondary bacterial infections  <cit> . hrv infection stimulates the epithelial production of reactive oxygen species by triggering the dsrna receptor nod-like receptor x- <dig>   <cit> . cross-talk between oxidative stress pathways and irf <dig> signaling was reported in the context of respiratory syncytial virus infection  <cit> . the role of irf <dig> in the regulation of nod-like receptor signaling and oxidative stress pathways during hrv infections merits further investigation in follow-up studies.

upstream regulator analysis demonstrated that irf <dig> was the most significant candidate molecular driver that was upregulated in the hrv response. however, our sirna studies showed that only about 30 % of the hrv responsive genes and half of known irf <dig> target genes were sensitive to irf <dig> knockdown. whilst variable and incomplete knockdown and the potential for non-specific activation of antiviral pathways is a well-known limitation of sirna technology, an alternative explanation of the data is that other transcription factors may be playing a role. employing upstream regulator analysis we showed that nf-κb, stat <dig>  stat <dig>  and irf <dig> were candidate drivers of the part of the hrv response that was insensitive to irf <dig> knockdown. in this context it is noteworthy we have reported that hrv-induced upregulation of cxcl <dig> in bronchial epithelial cells was dependent on irf <dig>  <cit> . wang et al. have also reported that knockdown of irf <dig> abrogated hrv-induced type i and iii interferon responses in beas-2b epithelial cells  <cit> . taken together, these observations suggest that interferon responses in hrv-induced hbe cells can be variably mediated by interactions between irf <dig>  irf <dig>  and irf <dig> 

this study has limitations that should be acknowledged. first, the gene expression studies were conducted at a single time point post infection , so it was not possible to determine the role of irf <dig> in the kinetics of the response. second, sirna-mediated gene silencing was used to investigate the role of irf <dig> in the regulation of gene expression patterns, and from this data it was not possible to determine if irf <dig> was playing a direct or indirect regulatory role. third, prior knowledge was used to infer the molecular drivers of the response, and this analysis cannot reveal novel molecular drivers. this latter limitation can be addressed using unbiased data-driven algorithms to infer the molecular drivers of the response  <cit> . although we acknowledge that the use of epithelial cells grown in submersion culture, as opposed to differentiated air-liquid interface cultures, may be considered a limitation of the current study, we believe that the data obtained are still highly relevant. this is based on the observation that the profile of hrv-upregulated genes in these cultures, in both the present and in an earlier study  <cit> , aligns closely with those observed in nasal epithelial scrapings from individuals experimentally infected with hrv in vivo  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates that irf <dig> regulates the expression of antiviral, inflammatory and oxidative stress response pathways during hrv infections in hbe cells, and suggests that additional transcription factors play an important role in the response.
