BACKGROUND
animals often need to choose between different courses of action on the basis of the eventual rewarding or reinforcing outcomes of those actions. however, the relationship between an action and an outcome is frequently uncertain: animals do not always obtain that for which they work. therefore, animals must incorporate information on the probability of obtaining different rewards when making decisions about what to do. little is known of the neural basis of this process. furthermore, when making decisions under conditions of uncertainty, individuals vary as to how much uncertainty or risk they are willing to tolerate. formally, individuals differ in how much they 'discount' the value of reinforcers as the uncertainty of the reinforcer increases   <cit> . risk taking is one aspect of the personality trait of impulsivity  <cit>  and is a feature of a number of psychiatric disorders, including pathological gambling and certain personality disorders  <cit> . the term 'risk' implies exposure to the possibility of an aversive consequence  <cit> , which may include the possibility of not obtaining an anticipated reward. in the appetitive domain, risk taking is exemplified by the tendency to choose large rewards that are very uncertain, in preference to smaller, certain rewards. abnormal risk taking may reflect dysfunction of reinforcement learning systems that mediate the effects of uncertain reward or punishment.

the nucleus accumbens  is one candidate structure that may influence choice involving uncertainty. the acb responds to anticipated rewards in humans, other primates, and rats  <cit> , and is innervated by dopamine  neurons that respond to errors in reward prediction in a manner appropriate for a teaching signal  <cit> . there is clear evidence that the acb is involved in the processing of delayed reinforcement and its influence upon choice. damage to the nucleus accumbens core  produces impulsive choice in rats  <cit> , reducing their ability to choose large, delayed rewards in preference to small, immediate rewards, yet these and other similar lesions do not appear to impair rats' ability to discriminate reward size  <cit> . furthermore, acbc lesions impair rats' ability to learn instrumental actions when the outcomes of those actions are delayed  <cit> . the acb may also be involved in the processing of uncertain or probabilistic reinforcement. da neurons that innervate the acb may fire in a manner related to reward probability  <cit>  and the midbrain, the site of the cell bodies of these neurons, responds to stimulus uncertainty in humans  <cit> . a greater blood flow response is observed in the human acb during the selection of high-reward/high-risk options, compared to low-reward/low-risk outcomes, in a task where the risk is of not winning  <cit> , with similar activation to high-reward/high-risk option selection in a task where the risk is of losing  <cit> ; this latter activation was correlated with personality measures of harm avoidance. however, these studies are correlative, and it is not known whether the acbc is causally involved in regulating choice involving uncertain reinforcement.

in the present study, we sought to examine the contribution of the acbc to choice involving probabilistic reinforcement in rats. we trained rats on a task in which they could choose regularly between a certain, small reward and an uncertain, large reward in discrete trials  and made excitotoxic acbc lesions before retesting the rats postoperatively. preoperatively, the proportion of choice trials in which the large reinforcer was chosen was approximately a linear function of the large-reinforcer probability. postoperatively, after a transient period in which acbc-lesioned rats were relatively indifferent between the two reinforcers, compared to sham-operated controls, a stable state emerged in which acbc-lesioned rats chose the large, uncertain reinforcer less often than shams did. this pattern persisted regardless of whether the large-reinforcer probability increased or decreased across the session. acbc-lesioned rats and controls continued to exhibit a strong preference for the large reinforcer when it was consistently certain, and a strong preference for the small, certain reinforcer when the large reinforcer was very unlikely; the lesioned and sham-operated groups did not differ from each other in either of these conditions. these results suggest that the acbc is necessary for the normal impact of unlikely  reinforcers upon choice.

RESULTS
histology
there were four postoperative deaths. histological analysis revealed that the lesions were incomplete or encroached significantly on neighbouring structures in two subjects. these subjects were excluded; final group numbers were therefore  <dig>  and  <dig> . lesions of the acbc encompassed most of the core subregion; neuronal loss and associated gliosis extended in an anteroposterior direction from approximately  <dig>  mm to  <dig>  mm anterior to bregma, and did not extend ventrally or caudally into the ventral pallidum or olfactory tubercle. damage to the ventromedial caudate-putamen was occasionally seen; damage to the nucleus accumbens shell  was restricted to the lateral edge of the dorsal shell. schematics of the lesions are shown in figure  <dig>  photomicrographs of lesions with identical parameters have been presented before  <cit> .

preoperative choice
the groups remained matched for preoperative choice behaviour following later histological selection . choice ratios  calculated across sessions 10– <dig>  were analysed using the model lesion intent <dig> × . there was a robust effect of probability  but no effect of lesion intent and no lesion intent × probability interaction .

early postoperative choice
in the initial postoperative period, acbc-lesioned rats exhibited relative indifference between the two alternatives, choosing the large reinforcer close to 50% of the time at all large-reinforcer probabilities; as a result, acbc-lesioned rats were more likely than shams to choose the large reinforcer when it was most uncertain . an analysis of choice ratios calculated across sessions 13– <dig> was performed using the anova model lesion <dig> × . this revealed a lesion × probability interaction . comparison of the two groups at individual large-reinforcer probabilities demonstrated that acbc-lesioned rats chose the large/uncertain reinforcer more than shams at preinforcer =  <dig>  , and at preinforcer =  <dig>  , but did not differ from shams at reinforcer probabilities of  <dig> – <dig> . nevertheless, simple effects of probability persisted both in shams  and in acbc-lesioned rats . choice at each preinforcer was compared to 50%  using post hoc two-tailed one-sample t tests, correcting pstatistical values using the Šidák correction for  <dig> comparisons. for shams, choice differed significantly from 50% at large-reinforcer probabilities of  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>  , but for acbc-lesioned rats, choice did not differ significantly from 50% at any large-reinforcer probability .

final postoperative choice
by the final three sessions of the basic task , the pattern of choice in acbc-lesioned rats had changed . once more, an analysis of choice ratios using the model lesion <dig> ×  revealed a lesion × probability interaction . by now, however, acbc-lesioned rats did not differ from shams with reinforcer probabilities of  <dig> - <dig>   but chose the large reinforcer less than shams when its probability was  <dig>   and  <dig> . as before, effects of probability persisted both in shams  and in acbc-lesioned rats .

choice when both reinforcers were certain, or both uncertain
when the large and small reinforcers were both delivered with certainty, acbc-lesioned and sham-operated rats strongly preferred the large reinforcer; when the small reinforcer was certain and the large reinforcer was consistently unlikely , all rats strongly preferred the small reinforcer . there were no group differences in either case. this indicates that both acbc-lesioned and sham-operated rats successfully discriminated the large reinforcer from the small reinforcer, and discriminated the certain large reinforcer from the uncertain large reinforcer. choice ratios from the final sessions of training in these two conditions  were analysed using the model lesion <dig> × . in the 'certain' condition , there was no effect of lesion , no lesion × block interaction , and no effect of trial block . similarly, in the 'uncertain' condition , there was no effect of lesion , no lesion × block interaction , and no effect of trial block .

choice with ascending probabilities
after rats had been trained with the large-reinforcer probability increasing across the session, choice behaviour was similar to that with the decreasing-probability version of the task used initially, with acbc-lesioned rats choosing the large/uncertain reinforcer less often than shams . choice ratios from sessions 44– <dig>  were analysed using the model lesion <dig> × . as before, there was a lesion × probability interaction , in addition to main effects of lesion  and probability , and there were strong effects of probability for both acbc-lesioned rats  and shams . acbc-lesioned rats differed from shams at reinforcer probabilities of  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig> , but not at preinforcer =  <dig>  .

postoperative choice: analysis by experienced probability
since the task was genuinely probabilistic, and not pseudorandom, it is possible that the probabilities experienced by subjects differed from the programmed probabilities . for example, one subject choosing an uncertain reinforcer at preinforcer =  <dig>  for  <dig> trials might experience  <dig> rewarded and  <dig> unrewarded trials , while another might experience  <dig> rewarded and  <dig> unrewarded . to establish whether such effects accounted to any degree for the pattern of choice observed in acbc-lesioned and sham-operated rats, choice was re-analysed for four sets of sessions . in each case, choice ratios were analysed using the model lesion <dig> × , with the factor × covariate term included in the model. experienced probabilities were calculated for all trial types , across the sessions concerned.

these analyses confirmed the pattern of results obtained on the basis of programmed probabilities. for the preoperative sessions, as expected, there was a main effect of experienced probability  but no significant terms involving lesion intent . for the baseline  task, both early  and late  in the postoperative testing, there was a lesion × experienced probability interaction . for the increasing-probability schedule , there was no lesion × experienced probability interaction  but there was a main effect of lesion .

indifference probabilities
choice ratios from sham-operated rats on sessions 22– <dig>  were analysed using four different linear predictors, based either on the probability of delivery of a large reinforcer , or of the odds against delivery of a large reinforcer, calculated as odds against = /p. this established that choice patterns were predicted best, in linear fashion, by experienced probabilities  and programmed probabilities , rather than by experienced odds  or programmed odds . since optimal behaviour would give choice that was a step function of probability , a single-parameter continuous function approximating a step function was also used to predict subjects' choice , but this gave a poor fit   <cit> . consequently, since choice was best described as a linear function of probability, indifference probabilities were calculated for sham-operated and acbc-lesioned rats, namely the probability at which rats were equally likely to choose the small/certain and large/uncertain reinforcers. these were calculated via a linear regression of probability on choice . this method has the potential to produce nonsensical probabilities for individual rats  but is nonetheless useful for group comparison. experienced large-reinforcer probabilities  were used, rather than programmed probabilities, though the pattern of results presented below was not altered by the use of programmed probabilities instead.

the main finding was that by the end of testing, acbc-lesioned rats had higher indifference probabilities  than sham-operated rats   – that is, while sham-operated rats behaved as if indifferent between a 1-pellet certain reinforcer and a 4-pellet reinforcer delivered with probability  <dig>  , acbc-lesioned rats behaved as if indifferent between a 1-pellet certain reinforcer and a 4-pellet reinforcer delivered with probability  <dig>  . that is, acbc-lesioned rats appeared to exhibit risk aversion by the end of testing. the full analysis was as follows. preoperatively , indifference probabilities were  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ; these did not differ . in the initial postoperative period , indifference probabilities were numerically lower in the lesioned group, being  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , but indifference probabilities were highly variable in both groups and these did not differ . in the later postoperative period , indifference probabilities were higher in the lesioned group, being  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , though again these did not differ significantly . in the increasing-probability version of the task , indifference probabilities were again higher in the lesioned group, being  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . by this stage the difference was highly significant , even if corrected for four comparisons  using the Šidák correction.

omissions and latencies
omissions were infrequent and not influenced by reinforcer probability or the lesion. omission data from the final postoperative baseline sessions  were analysed. overall, omissions  across all trial types occurred at a rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % . omissions on choice trials for the same sessions were analysed using the model lesion <dig> × . there were no effects of lesion  or probability , and no interaction . almost all omissions were failures to initiate a trial  rather than failures to respond once a trial had been initiated .

initiation latencies on choice trials for sessions 22– <dig> were analysed in the same manner. they were not affected by the lesion , nor by the large-reinforcer probability , and there was no lesion × probability interaction .

response latencies were not affected by the lesion, but were affected both by the time in the session, with responding tending to get slower as the session progressed, and by the likelihood of obtaining a large reinforcer, with responding tending to get faster as large-reinforcer delivery became more likely. response latencies on choice trials for sessions 22– <dig> were analysed using the model lesion <dig> × . response latencies varied across trial blocks: response latencies were initially  <dig>  s  and slowed to  <dig>  s  . latencies were not affected by the lesion, or the lever being chosen, and there were no interactions . to establish whether these effects were due to the large-reinforcer probability, or to progressive satiation or the passage of time, data from sessions 44– <dig> were also analysed, because in these sessions the large-reinforcer probability increased within the session. this time, there was a response × trial block interaction , with no other terms significant . responding on the small/certain lever initially took  <dig>  s in the first trial block and slowed to  <dig>  s in the last trial block , but responding on the large/uncertain lever initially took  <dig>  s  and speeded up to  <dig>  s  .

the lesion did not affect the latency to collect reward. food collection latencies on rewarded trials were analysed across sessions 22– <dig>  this time including both forced and choice trials to enable an analysis by response and probability. the model lesion <dig> ×  was used; this revealed main effects of response  and probability , but no other significant terms . collection was faster following delivery of the large reinforcer than the small , and got slightly slower across the session .

amount of food obtained
acbc-lesioned rats obtained less food as a result of their choices . an analysis of the average number of pellets obtained on choice trials in sessions 13– <dig> using the model lesion <dig> ×  revealed a main effect of lesion , as well as an effect of probability , but no interaction . a similar analysis of the final baseline postoperative sessions 22– <dig> revealed a lesion × probability interaction  in addition to main effects of lesion  and probability . however, the only probability at which groups significantly differed was p =  <dig> ; when the large reinforcer probability was  <dig> - <dig> , the two groups did not differ in the amount of food obtained .

effects of hunger and satiety on choice
alternating between hunger and satiety had no substantial effects on choice . choice ratios for sessions 25– <dig> were analysed using the model lesion <dig> × . as before, a main effect of probability  and a lesion × probability interaction  were present; in addition, there was a marginally significant lesion × hunger × probability interaction . however, an effect of hunger was not detectable in either group alone, either for shams  or for acbc-lesioned rats . similarly, the differences between groups persisted both in the hungry  and the sated  conditions.

locomotor activity and body mass
acbc-lesioned rats were hyperactive and slower to habituate to a novel environment . acbc-lesioned rats also gained less mass postoperatively. at the time of surgery, the groups did not differ in mass , but at the end of the experiment acbc-lesioned rats weighed less than shams . both effects are consistent with previous results: acbc-lesioned rats are known to exhibit locomotor hyperactivity  <cit>  and to weigh less than sham-operated controls  <cit> . they also eat the food used as the maintenance diet in the present study more slowly than sham-operated controls, and eat less of it in a given time, but do not differ in consumption of the sucrose pellets used as reinforcers in the present study  <cit> . it is not known whether there are metabolic differences in acbc-lesioned rats above and beyond the tendency to eat somewhat less and to be hyperactive . however, differences in mass between acbc-lesioned and sham-operated rats are also apparent when they have been fed ad libitum ever since the lesion was made, with acbc-lesioned rats weighing ~88% as much as sham-operated controls in this situation  <cit> , much as in the present study . this suggests that the food deprivation regimen maintained the proportional relationship between actual and free-feeding mass similarly in sham-operated and acbc-lesioned rats.

discussion
these results suggest that the acbc contributes to the selection of uncertain rewards. acbc-lesioned rats exhibited risk-averse choice: they chose large, uncertain rewards less than sham-operated controls when offered a smaller, certain alternative, even though they showed a strong and unaltered preference for large rewards over small rewards, and for certain rewards over uncertain rewards. by the end of testing, the control group behaved as if indifferent between a single certain food pellet and four pellets delivered with p =  <dig>  , while the acbc-lesioned group behaved as if indifferent between a single certain pellet and four pellets delivered with p =  <dig> .

though these results establish that the lesions used in this study caused this pattern of behaviour, the precise mechanism by which this occurs is unknown: for example, it is possible that the damage caused to structures adjacent to the acbc, though limited, played a role in this pattern of choice, or that adaptations in other structures consequent upon the lesion were important in the behavioural effects .

choice in normal subjects
the dominant model of uncertainty or probability discounting  <cit>  suggests that subjects calculate a value for each reinforcer, according to its size and other parameters, and discount this by multiplying it by 1/, where θ represents the odds against obtaining the reinforcer, θ = /p, and h represents an odds discounting parameter that is specific to the individual subject but stable over time for that subject. in this model, value is a hyperbolic function of the odds θ; such a hyperbolic function is supported by empirical research, at least in humans  <cit> . the present task is not well suited to evaluating such a quantitative model, since in discrete-trial schedules it is often the case that animals maximize, or allocate most of their choices to whichever option is the more favourable  <cit> . however, the behaviour of normal subjects here can be evaluated as to its optimality. in the present task, neither risk aversion nor risk taking is optimal if carried to extremes. optimal behaviour, to maximize the expected amount of food, is to choose the small/certain lever when the large  reinforcer probability is less than  <dig> , to choose the large/uncertain lever when the probability exceeds  <dig> , and to be indifferent at p =  <dig>  . shams' choice of the large reinforcer behaviour was better described by a linear function of the large-reinforcer probability than by such a step function. nevertheless, shams' behaviour was reasonably close to the optimal in the most obvious way to measure optimality, namely the amount of food obtained .

effects of acbc lesions in terms of conditioning processes
acbc-lesioned rats chose the large, uncertain reinforcer less often than shams did, but only when a smaller certain reinforcer was available as an alternative; that is, they exhibited risk-averse choice. a number of simple explanations of the present results may be ruled out. for example, it is unlikely that the pattern of choice exhibited by acbc-lesioned rats can be explained in terms of perseveration, within a session, on the initially-optimal lever. it might be that animals that perseverated on the lever delivering the small, certain reinforcer, because that lever was initially optimal, would appear to exhibit risk-averse choice in sessions in which the large-reinforcer probability increased across the session , but this could not explain the same pattern of choice in sessions in which the same lever was initially suboptimal, i.e. when the large-reinforcer probability decreased across the session . furthermore, although acbc lesions are known to affect processes through which pavlovian conditioned stimuli  affect behaviour, including pavlovian-instrumental transfer , autoshaping, and conditioned reinforcement  <cit> , there was no pavlovian cs that was differentially associated with uncertain as opposed to certain reinforcement in this task, so these effects cannot explain the present results. it might be that the acbc lesion impaired subjects' knowledge of the instrumental action-outcome contingency specifically for the uncertain outcome. there is some debate about the role of the acbc in instrumental conditioning  and goal-directed action, a subset of instrumental conditioning  <cit> . manipulation of the acbc can certainly affect instrumental learning  <cit> . however, the acbc is not required for simple instrumental conditioning: rats with acbc lesions acquire lever-press responses on fixed-ratio- <dig> schedules at supernormal levels  <cit> , and rats with acb or acbc lesions are fully sensitive to changes in the action-outcome contingency  <cit> . however, when acquiring a sequence of random ratio schedules, acbc-lesioned rats respond somewhat less than sham-operated controls  <cit> , while lesions of the whole acb made rats respond slightly, though not significantly, less on a similar sequence of random ratio schedules  <cit> . random ratio schedules clearly involve probabilistic reinforcement, so these results are consistent with the possibility that the present impairment shown by acbc-lesioned rats in choosing large, unlikely rewards is due to impaired instrumental conditioning when the outcome is uncertain – and, conversely, that the impairment in simple instrumental learning seen previously  <cit>  was specifically a result of the reward uncertainty inherent in a random ratio schedule, given that acbc-lesioned rats learn instrumental responses normally or supernormally with certain immediate reinforcement  <cit> . it is also possible that acbc-lesioned rats represent the instrumental contingency normally with uncertain reward, but simply value the uncertain outcome less and respond less for it accordingly, as discussed next.

effects of acbc lesions in terms of probability discounting and reinforcer magnitude sensitivity
since the present study required rats to choose between small, certain and large, uncertain rewards, an effect of the lesion to alter the perception of relative reward magnitude might affect choice, just as an alteration in the perception of reward probability might. for example, altering the absolute magnitudes of the reinforcers can affect choice involving probabilistic reinforcement  <cit> , as would be predicted if reinforcer 'value' is not simply a linear function of physical magnitude  <cit> . specifically, the present results  could be explained by 'risk aversion' , or if the difference between  <dig> and  <dig> pellets was perceived to be smaller by acbc-lesioned subjects than by shams . for example, if a normal subject assigned values of  <dig> and  <dig> to the reinforcers, and a lesioned subject assigned values of  <dig> and  <dig> to the same reinforcers, then the lesioned subject would be less likely than the sham to choose the large reinforcer when it was made uncertain, even without any primary abnormality in the processing of probability. at first glance, this interpretation would appear to be supported by the observation that acbc-lesioned rats chose the large reinforcer somewhat less often than shams when it was certain, as well as when it was uncertain. however, several lines of evidence suggest this explanation is not the correct one. when the large and the small reinforcers were both made consistently certain, there were no differences between acbc-lesioned rats and controls . furthermore, other evidence indicates that acbc lesions do not impair reinforcer magnitude discrimination or the perception of relative reinforcer value. excitotoxic lesions of the whole acb do not prevent rats from detecting changes in reward value   <cit> . such lesions also do not impair rats' ability to respond faster when environmental cues predict the availability of larger rewards  <cit> , and nor does inactivation of the acb with local anaesthetic or blockade of ampa glutamate receptors in the acb  <cit> ; the effects of intra-acb nmda receptor antagonists have varied  <cit> . acbc-lesioned rats can still discriminate large from small rewards  <cit> . similarly, da depletion of the acb does not affect the ability to discriminate large from small reinforcers  <cit> , and systemic da antagonists do not affect the perceived quantity of food as assessed in a psychophysical procedure  <cit> . furthermore, a recent study found evidence that acbc-lesioned rats may even show somewhat enhanced reinforcer magnitude discrimination   <cit> . given that reinforcer magnitude discrimination appears to be unimpaired, at worst, by acbc lesions, the observation in the present study that acbc-lesioned rats chose the large reinforcer somewhat less often than controls in the task in which large-reinforcer probabilities changed throughout the session is more likely to be explained by within-session generalization  <cit>  – i.e. that avoidance of the large reinforcer during trial blocks when it was uncertain generalized to trial blocks when it was certain. together, these findings suggest that the present results are best explained as an effect of acbc lesions to increase the rate of uncertainty/odds/probability discounting – effectively, a tendency to behave as if an uncertain outcome were less likely than it really is.

probability versus delay discounting
it is known that acbc lesions affect choice and learning involving delayed reinforcement  <cit> . it has been suggested that delay  discounting, the process by which delayed reinforcers lose value, and probability  discounting, the process by which uncertain reinforcers lose value, reflect the same underlying process  <cit> . for example, in the present task, choosing the uncertain large reinforcer five times but only obtaining it on the fifth response might be seen as equivalent to a very long delay, on average, between choice of the large reinforcer and its eventual delivery. alternatively, delays may be seen as entailing the ecological risk of losing the reward during the delay. the failure of acbc-lesioned rats to choose an uncertain reinforcer  and their failure to choose a delayed reinforcer may therefore be explained in the same way. however, there is evidence that time and probability discounting are different and dissociable processes  <cit> . most simply, it is not surprising that currency inflation affects human decisions involving delayed but not probabilistic financial reward  <cit> . moreover, the absolute magnitude of rewards can have different effects on delayed and probabilistic discounting  <cit> . a study looking at human choices in a gambling task found that individuals' propensity to choose rapidly  and their propensity to bet large amounts of money on uncertain outcomes  represented independent factors  <cit> . some studies have found abnormal delay discounting, but not uncertainty discounting, in drug addicts  <cit> , while gamblers have been observed to discount probabilistic rewards less steeply than controls  without showing differences in delay discounting  <cit> .

implications for acbc function and impulsivity
impulsivity is multifaceted, reflecting – at the least – individual differences in distinct and dissociable processes involving information gathering, the selection of outcomes, and the inhibition of motor actions  <cit> . furthermore, as discussed above, delay discounting and probability discounting may also reflect separate processes. damage to the acbc can produce impulsive choice in the sense of an impaired ability to choose delayed rewards  <cit> , in addition to hyperactivity  <cit> , though without impairments in attentional function  <cit>  and without motoric impulsivity as assessed by the stop-signal task  <cit> . in the context of choice involving uncertain appetitive reinforcement, 'impulsivity' would equate to risk taking . acbc lesions, however, produced a risk-averse or conservative pattern of choice in the present study. clearly, then, acbc-lesioned rats cannot be characterized as impulsive in all senses. a more appropriate unifying concept would seem to be that the acbc promotes the selection, and perhaps the salience, of uncertain and delayed rewards – perhaps, in general, of rewards that are not certain, imminent, or present  <cit> . the acbc promotes choice of  <cit>  and learning with  <cit>  delayed rewards. it appears to promote the selection of uncertain reinforcers , and this is compatible with human imaging studies showing increased acb blood flow during the selection of high-risk options  <cit> . the acb is required for pit, the process by which pavlovian css signalling reward enhance instrumental responding for those rewards  <cit> . it is also required for autoshaping, or locomotor approach to appetitive pavlovian css  <cit> , and it influences conditioned reinforcement, the process of working for css previously paired with reinforcement  <cit> . acb da also contributes to subjects' motivation to work hard  <cit> .

it is not known whether acbc lesions would produce similar effects on choice involving uncertain aversive events. it would be expected that increased odds/uncertainty/probability discounting – effectively, a tendency to behave as if an uncertain outcome were less likely than it really is – would produce risk aversion for appetitive outcomes  but risk proneness for aversive outcomes   <cit> . in humans, at least, the delay and probability discounting processes appear similar for rewards and losses  <cit> .

relationship to structures and neuromodulator systems innervating the acbc
the prefrontal cortex , which projects heavily to the acbc  <cit> , is also involved in decision-making under conditions of uncertainty. humans with orbitofrontal cortex  or ventromedial pfc damage are impaired on the iowa gambling task  <cit> , in which subjects must learn to differentiate between low-reward, low-risk card decks that yield a net positive outcome and high-reward, high-risk decks that yield a net negative outcome, though the precise locus and nature of the deficit seen on this task is debated  <cit> . choice between small, likely rewards and large, unlikely rewards increases cerebral blood flow in orbital and inferior pfc  <cit> , and ofc damage also impairs performance of a task requiring human subjects to choose between two possible outcomes and to bet on their choice, with lesioned subjects deciding slowly and failing to choose the optimal, most likely outcome  <cit> . excitotoxic lesions of the ofc make rats less likely than sham-operated controls to choose a large, uncertain reward over a small, certain reward  <cit> ; ofc-lesioned rats had lower indifference odds  and exhibited risk-averse choice, just like the acbc-lesioned subjects in the present study. there is direct evidence that ofc lesions do alter sensitivity to the relative magnitudes of the two rewards  <cit> , as does ofc da depletion  <cit> , but the effects on uncertainty discounting are present in addition to those on reinforcer magnitude sensitivity  <cit> .

the acb is also innervated by the a number of neuromodulator systems, including the serotonin  system  <cit> . although manipulations of 5-ht influence choice involving delayed reinforcement, there is less evidence that they influence choice involving uncertainty and risk. correlational studies have indicated that low cerebrospinal fluid  levels of the 5-ht metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid  are associated with risk taking in monkeys  <cit>  and impulsive aggression, violence, and suicide in humans  <cit> . forebrain 5-ht depletion tends to steepen temporal  discounting ; however, it does not appear to influence choice involving probabilistic reinforcement. dietary tryptophan depletion  <cit>  decreases levels of 5-ht metabolites in csf, an indirect indicator of brain 5-ht levels, but has not been shown to affect probability discounting in humans  <cit> ; similarly, forebrain 5-ht depletion in rats does not affect choice between small, certain rewards and large, uncertain rewards  <cit> . the acbc also receives a substantial da innervation, and da neurons respond to reward prediction errors  <cit> . although systemic d2-type da receptor antagonists can induce impulsive choice involving delayed reinforcement  <cit> , this effect may not occur in the acb  <cit> , the response of da neurons specifically to reward uncertainty is debated  <cit> , and little is known of the role of da in choice involving uncertain rewards. systemic noradrenergic  blockade has also been shown to affect decision-making under uncertainty in humans, by reducing the discrimination between magnitudes of different losses when the probability of losing was high  <cit> , though na reuptake inhibition has not been shown to affect the iowa gambling task  <cit> . however, the acb does not receive a substantial na innervation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that excitotoxic lesions of the acbc induce risk-averse choice in rats. acbc lesions did not prevent rats from discriminating a large reward from a small reward, or a certain reward from an uncertain reward. however, when offered the choice between a small/certain reward and a large/uncertain reward, acbc-lesioned rats showed a reduced preference for the large/uncertain reward  in their final pattern of postoperative choice. acbc-lesioned rats exhibited a tendency to behave as if an uncertain outcome were less likely than was really the case. together with previous studies, these results suggest that the acbc contributes to reinforcement and choice particularly when the reinforcer is temporally distant or uncertain.
