BACKGROUND
russeting is a common disorder that affects the peel of different organs  in several species such as potato, tomato, apple and pear . the consumer perception of russeted fruits is quite different among species. for example, russeting in the pear is an important quality attribute of the fruit, while apple russeting is often considered negative. great interest has been raised by apple clones that are less prone to russeting than the original cultivar, such as ‘golden delicious smoothee®’ and ‘golden reinders®’ as compared with the original ‘golden delicious’  variety. in the past, russeting was not considered a defect since it was associated with increased aroma perception  <cit> . interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated that suberized skin on russet varieties contains a peculiar class of chemicals that have been shown to have immunomodulatory activity, the triterpenes-caffeates  <cit> . the potential beneficial effect on human health may therefore give rise to renewed interest in russeted varieties. in apple, russeting predominantly occurs on the stalk or eye cavities, as patches scattered over the cheeks or covering the whole fruit  <cit> . environmental conditions and growing practices can heavily influence russet formation. several works have demonstrated that a range of abiotic and biotic agents may favour russeting outbreak such as prolonged periods of high levels of surface moisture and humidity , chemical applications  <cit> , mechanical wounding  <cit>  and infection by pests or microorganisms .

in apple, russeting is thought to result from the formation of a plastic periderm in response to microcracking on stiff cuticle  <cit> . following skin failure, the underlying cork cambium  rapidly forms new cells  in order to replace the damaged epidermis and combat water losses. the depositing of suberized cell layers  thus gives rise to the typical brown and corky aspect of russeted apples . the formation of microcracks is most likely due to cuticle incapability to keep pace with cortex growth, particularly during early developing stages, concomitantly with the fruit growth rate peaks  <cit> . despite the progress in phenology and in the aetiology of apple russeting, the genetics underlying this phenomenon is still poorly understood. the genetic bases of apple russeting is supported by such evidences as  apple collections with cultivars that display considerable russeting variability, irrespective of growth conditions;  the occurrence of russeted sport mutations of non-russeted cultivars, and  the segregation of the character in controlled crosses. the occurrence of fruit sectorial chimeras and spontaneous/induced sport mutations have been reported in the literature, with either russet-free sports from russet susceptible cultivars or russeted sports from trees bearing fruits with no or little russet . examples of russeted bud sport mutants are ‘siddington russet’, ‘norfolk royal russet’ and ‘daligris’ that arose from ‘galloway pippin’, ‘norfolk royal’  <cit>  and ‘pinova’ , respectively. such evidence, plus the inheritance studies carried out on a number of crosses between genotypes with different russeting extents, provided the first evidence of the genetic control of the trait  <cit> . alston and watkins, considering the russeted sports and the segregation observed in the progeny of ‘court pendu plat’ and ‘d’arcy spice’, stated that a simple genetic control  might be responsible for complete russeting  <cit> . in contrast, a multi-factorial control for non-complete russeting has been claimed following the evaluation of offspring from combinations between partially russeted and either slightly to full russeted varieties  <cit> . segregation ratios observed in the progeny of the moderate russeted cultivars ‘cox’s orange pippin’ suggested a major gene, the effect of which was modulated by further minor genes  <cit> . conversely, polygenic control has been suggested in other crops such as potato and pear. in diploid potatoes, russet characteristics were found to be determined by the complementary action of three dominant genes inherited independently; a change in one of the three loci resulting in a transition to either direction  <cit> . in pear, a model based on two dominant genes  was thought to govern russeting in japanese pear : the r locus was responsible for russet development while the modifier i locus partially suppressed cork formation  <cit> . a complex control of partial russeting has also been inferred from genetic studies on the progeny of p. communis  <cit> . the objective of the present work was to investigate the genetic control of fruit russeting in apple. towards this end, a dense genetic map was developed using a f <dig> segregating population obtained from the controlled cross between the full-russeted genotype ‘renetta grigia di torriana’  and gd, a cultivar characterized by slight to moderate russeting depending on environmental conditions.

RESULTS
phenotypic data assessment
datasets of fruit skin russeting percentages recorded over four seasons from  <dig> to  <dig> consisted of rgtxgd populations ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> individuals . regardless of seasonal conditions, rgt and gd parents constantly showed russeting of 95- <dig> % and 0- <dig> %, respectively . correlation coefficients  of phenotypic data between years ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . non-normal distribution of phenotypic data was statistically confirmed by the shapiro-wilks test , which showed a significant deviation from normality  occuring each year. the deviation from normality  and a bi-modal distribution of data was also observed after images analysis in  <dig> . data obtained from russet measurement from images strongly correlated with field data in the same year . a sharp cut-off identified at about  <dig> % of russet coverage divided the progeny into two subsets  and led to the hypothesis that a single major determinant might be responsible for the trait. the hypothesis was supported by the chi square test  carried out on data organized according to the classification reported by  <cit>  in which russet coverage of  <dig> % was fixed as the threshold for distinguishing clean  from russeted apples .table  <dig> relationships between annual datasets of russeting field observations on the rgtxgd f <dig> population , and shapiro-wilks test significance for normality distribution

genetic maps
the segregating population and parents were genotyped using the 20 k apple infinium® snp chip  <cit>  produced by illumina inc.  and a set of microsatellites uniformly distributed across the  <dig> linkage groups  chosen accordingly to previous maps as described in the methods. array data mining identified  <dig>   polymorphic snps belonging to both the abxaa and aaxab segregating types that were retained to build maternal and paternal maps according to the double pseudo-test cross model  <cit> . the less informative abxab markers  were discarded as well as those monomorphic  and those that failed or were difficult to score . of  <dig> tested ssrs,  <dig> were polymorphic and resulted in  <dig> map positions due to multiple loci. the rgt map consisted of  <dig>  markers  assembled into the expected  <dig> lgs, spanning  <dig>  cm of genetic map distance, whereas gd map consisted of  <dig>   markers grouped into the homologous  <dig> lgs, covering  <dig>  cm. the number of markers mapped per lg varied from  <dig> of lg <dig> to  <dig> of lg <dig> in rgt parent, while in gd the range was from  <dig> of the lg <dig> to  <dig> markers of the lg <dig>  due to population size and the large portion of markers that co-segregated, markers were binned and only one snp or ssr marker per locus was kept to obtain two abridged maps that consisted of  <dig> and  <dig> markers , with a mean interval between adjacent markers of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm for rgt and gd, respectively. gaps between markers larger than 10 cm were found on the lg <dig> in rgt, and lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the gd parent. some regions with clear skewed marker segregation were found along some lgs of both rgt  and gd . the full list of markers ordered by lgs, their segregation and skewedness is provided as additional material .fig.  <dig> distribution of unique co-segregating marker loci on the rgt  and gd  parental maps. black bars represent either snp or ssr markers. linkage group  number is indicated on the top of each lg. genetic distance in cm is shown on the left ruler



qtl analysis
qtl analysis of on field data
the kruskal-wallis  statistical test showed a stable significant association between molecular markers and percentage of fruit russet coverage on lg <dig> in rgt  that we named ru_rgt locus according to  <cit> . the qtl peak co-segregated each year with the marker snp_fb_ <dig> and  <dig> further co-segregating snp markers  at approximately  <dig>  cm from the top of the lg, a region that would refer to the contig mdc <dig>  of the apple v <dig>  assembly. the k* values of the qtl peak associated with snp_fb_ <dig> ranged from  <dig>  in  <dig> to  <dig>    . no additional qtls were detected in the rgt genetic map, while the kw test identified further minor qtls on lg <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the gd map . as well as for the kw test, interval mapping  carried out on condensed parental maps confirmed the presence of a strong and stable qtl on lg <dig> of rgt . marker snp_fb_ <dig> was constantly associated with the qtl peak for each of the four years, and explained from  <dig>  %  to  <dig>  %  of phenotypic variance. no further significant qtl was identified in the rest of the genome either in rgt or in gd by im. a multiple qtl-mapping  analysis restricted the most significant qtl on lg <dig> to an interval of  <dig>  cm, delimited by markers snp_fb_ <dig>  and ss <dig>  . the region within these boundaries corresponded to a physical distance of about  <dig>  mbp on the apple reference genome  <cit> .fig.  <dig> quantitative trait locus  controlling the russeting identified on rgt lg <dig>  coloured dashed lines refer to k* values obtained after kw statistical test on four seasons transformed data from both field observations and digital photos analysis . the marker with the highest k* value across seasons and phenotyping methods is typed in bold and italics. significance level at p <  <dig>  is represented by a vertical dashed line fixed at a k* value  of  <dig>  as provided by the kw test on mean field data. the most significant qtl interval obtained through the mqm model is highlighted in pink



qtl analysis on digital images
a qtl analysis was also performed on phenotypic data obtained in  <dig> by digital photograph evaluation . the kw test and im confirmed the presence of a strong qtl in lg <dig> of rgt , which was consistent with that identified with the field data . the main qtl fell within the same interval as assessed by mqm on field data, and marker snp_fb_ <dig> showed the highest linkage. no further qtl was identified in any other lgs of rgt. in gd, the non-parametric test identified two minor qtls: one on lg <dig> and another on lg <dig> .

two genotype-phenotype incongruence  plants  <cit>  have been identified: plant  <dig> produced low russeted fruits but held the favorable allele for russet from rgt, while plant  <dig> had the alternative allele with the highly russeted fruits phenotype . these two gpi plants were included in the primary qtl mapping.

fine mapping and candidate gene analysis
to fine map the qtl on the lg <dig> of rgt, a set of microsatellite markers  was newly developed from the sequence of the apple reference genome. seven ssrs, physically close to the snps belonging to the ru_rgt locus established by the mqm analysis, were found to be polymorphic in rgt . the analysis was extended to the closest available external ssrs cv <dig> and hi07f <dig>  the ssrs genetic position and co-association with snps were confirmed by genotyping the rgtxgd mapping population . the ru_rgt haplotype reconstruction was implemented by further testing these nine microsatellites on the  <dig> individuals of the rgtx‘goldrush’  cross. in a total of  <dig> seedlings, nineteen genotypes were found to recombine in the interval spanned by cv <dig> and hi07f <dig> markers . the map order of the new ssrs was according to the v <dig>  assembly and three recombinants enabled to fine map the ru_rgt locus, between markers udmdssr_ <dig> and udmdssr_ <dig>  to a physical interval of about  <dig> kb in the reference genome sequence. between these flanking markers, a cluster of three co-segregating ssr markers spanning about 150 kb  was found and these markers were also co-segregating with the snp_fb_ <dig> .fig.  <dig> fine mapping of the ru_rgt locus on chromosome  <dig>  partial bottom region of the rgt lg <dig> is reported on the top as a horizontal bar. genetic distances in cm between ssrs were calculated using recombination events occurred across  <dig> individuals from rgtxgd  and rgtxgrh  crosses. recombinants between cv <dig> and hi07f <dig> ssrs are indicated on the left as well as the corresponding phenotype assessed for rgtxgd progeny according to  <cit> ; brown bars represent the russeting haplotype, while green bars the alternative haplotypes. the restricted ru_rgt locus is delimited by dotted vertical lines. physical representation of the ru_rgt locus is presented at the bottom according to the gdr gbrowse; yellow rectangles represent annotated genes, while the position of ssr markers within the locus is indicated according to the golden delicious v <dig>  assembly



the gd reference sequence at the qtl region was visualized in gbrowse and the region directly downstream the udmdssr_ <dig> marker  resulted well-covered by a few long contigs while the remaining 150 kb towards the udmdssr_ <dig> marker was rather fragmented with many short contigs and some gaps . within this region, a total of  <dig> genes were predicted by browsing the genome database for rosaceae  , most of which from the upstream region closer to the udmdssr_ <dig> marker. interestingly, a gene model  on contig mdc <dig>  showed best homology  with a plasma membrane-localized atp-binding cassette half-transporter abcg <dig> of a. thaliana .

analysis of the russeting ru_rgt haplotype in apple germplasm
seventeen russeted apple cultivars sorted out from apple germplasm and four non russeted  cultivars were analysed both with eight ssr markers spanning  <dig>  cm surrounding the ru_rgt qtl region and  <dig> unlinked ssr markers to estimate their kinship. seven russeted cultivars, rgt included, displayed the same haplotype associated to the ru_rgt qtl at all markers of the region; the remaining ten russeted cultivars showed alternative alleles, with few exceptions for markers with more relaxed linkage to the ru_rgt qtl, like udmdssr_ <dig>  udmdssr_ <dig> and udmdssr_ <dig>  that occasionally showed the same alleles associated to the ru_rgt haplotype . several of these alleles were also present in ‘gala’, a non russeted cultivar. in the group of cultivars carrying the conserved ru_rgt haplotype, only rgt and ‘pum rusnein’ showed a strong relatedness coefficient , close to the expected value of  <dig>  indicating a first-degree relationship ; the remaining cultivars of the group did not show remarkable kinship among them or with any other cultivar of the panel . conversely, the group of ten cultivars, that did not carry the ru_rgt haplotype, showed extended relatedness . interestingly, several of these cultivars showed relatedness with gd and ‘gala’, clean cultivars included in the panel only for the analysis of alleles alternative to the ru_rgt haplotype .fig.  <dig> haplotypes at the ru_rgt locus on chromosome  <dig> in apple germplasm. a set of eight ssrs evenly distributed along the bottom region of the lg <dig>  and containing the ru_rgt locus was analysed in a group of  <dig> accessions of which  <dig> are reported as russeted according to  <cit>  indications, while four controls have none or very little skin russeting. markers are distributed according to map and physical positions from rgt and gd. alleles coupled to skin russeting in rgt were highlighted in bold and italics. the length of udmdssr markers alleles includes the m <dig> tail. the restricted ru_rgt locus is indicated by vertical lines



discussion
although several studies on apple russeting aetiology enabled a better comprehension of the mechanical causes provoking this phenomenon, the genetics behind russeting was scarcely investigated according to the reviewed literature.

score classes and visual vs digital image analysis of russeting
the visual field russet phenotyping of the rgtxgd progeny across four seasons clearly showed that the segregation of russet skin coverage significantly fits the hypothesis of a major gene controlling the trait. the russeting threshold used by  <cit>  to define clean and russet genotypes was adopted and was supported by our results, particularly when considering data from the analysis of digital photos. data obtained through this method, although considering a limited number of sampled fruits and the limits of the bi-dimensional images, confirmed the results of visual scoring, but also appeared a more objective and precise method of analysis compared with visual scoring. this aspect was particularly relevant for confirming the russeting coverage threshold to distinguish between the two classes of clean and russet genotypes. although in  <dig> data from these two methods exhibited a high correlation, the digital scoring showed a clear discontinuity distribution at about 20- <dig> % skin coverage, consistently with  <cit>  results.

the 20 k infinium® illumina snp chip for mapping and qtl analysis in apple
this is the first work reporting on the adoption of the 20 k infinium® illumina snp chip for a qtl analysis survey. the qtl analysis revealed the great improvement in map construction afforded by the 20 k infinium® illumina snp chip in terms of resolution and genome coverage in respect to the standard methods used so far . the high density genetic maps obtained with the snp array were integrated with known microsatellite markers for linkage group assignment. this dense map may prove very useful in future for correct landing in the apple genome sequence for snp identification in specific genetic positions. evidence reported in this paper strongly support the presence of a major qtl at the bottom of lg <dig> associated with apple skin russeting in the cultivar rgt and this determinant was named ru_rgt. despite the different genetic background, the observed segregation is in agreement with the model of a single gene  suggested by  <cit>  for ‘d’arcy spice’. the ru_rgt locus can explain most of the phenotypic variation observed for the trait but the presence of other genes that influence russet formation has to be postulated because of the differences observed in russet coverage both for plants carrying and for those not carrying the ru_rgt gene. several qtls located on the lower portion of chromosome  <dig> were indicated as involved in resistance/tolerance to fungal and bacterial diseases  or in controlling fruit quality and phenology traits . however, the lg <dig> has never been indicated before as the chromosome where russet controlling genes would lie, neither in apple nor in pear. recently a large phenotyping/genotyping study on an apple training population sought to test the accuracy of genomic selection in predicting genomic breeding values, indicated that a snp marker  on lg <dig> had the highest effect on skin russet coverage, while at least three other qtls, on lgs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively, had a moderate effect  <cit> . this discrepancy could be due to the different genotypes analyzed, where these could carry genes with similar functions located in different chromosomes, considering the ancestral polyploidization of apple genome, but none of these chromosomes are homeologous to lg <dig>  <cit> . mapping studies in pyrus, an apple-related genus, identified two qtls controlling fruit skin russeting in lg <dig>  <cit>  and lg <dig>  <cit>  and again both these lgs are non-homeologous with lg <dig>  <cit> . lack of synteny between apple and pear for specific traits was also observed for fruit red skin color  mapped on the non-homeologous lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  in apple and pear, respectively  <cit> . the reliability of the three minor qtls detected in this study on lgs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> would require a further validation on a large progeny. this because they were clearly not fully reproducible among years and detected only by the kw analysis. furthermore, none of these putative qtls regions were known as involved in russeting in published studies.

fine mapping of the ru_rgt locus and identification of a candidate gene
since the kw test showed that the significant qtl on lg <dig> encompassed a large part of the lg at a significance level of p <  <dig>  , an mqm analysis carried out on the condensed map permitted restriction of the locus to a corresponding  <dig>  mbp interval of the reference genome. recombinants of the region from the two segregating populations meant the candidate region could be reduced to a physical interval of about  <dig> kb, between the newly developed ssr markers udmdssr_ <dig> and udmdssr_ <dig>  a search of genes potentially involved in fruit skin organization or active on peel related molecules biosynthesis was performed and among the  <dig> genes annotated within this region, the gene model mdp <dig> was identified as a good candidate for russeting control. the blast search assessed against the tair protein database indicated a strong similarity between the apple gene and the arabidopsis thaliana atp-binding cassette g <dig> . the gene also known as dso , cof <dig> , or atwbc <dig>  was demonstrated to encode for a g sub-family abc half-transporter protein involved in cuticle development . the encoded protein is reported to be involved in cuticle development, cutin and wax secretion, particularly in reproductive organs . cuticle is a polymer that consists of a c16-c <dig> fatty acids cutin matrix embedding waxes to form a complex hydrophobic layer aimed to protect inner tissues from water loss, biotic/abiotic stresses, and to prevent post-genital organ fusion. the arabidopsis abcg <dig> protein localizes in the plasma membrane, where it forms functional homo and/or heterodimer complexes  <cit>  in order to play its role as cutin and wax monomers transporter from the inside of epidermal cells to the extracellular matrix. recent rna-seq studies on the sand pear   <cit>  and apple  <cit>  pericarp transcriptome showed several genes differentially expressed between green/waxy and russet mrna libraries. in the japanese pear, some abc transporters involved in cuticular lipids precursors transport displayed transcriptional differences among russeted and non-russeted genotypes. transcripts of the unigene galr <dig>  which showed a high similarity with arabidopsis abcg family transporters, were more abundant in green exocarp than in russeted skin, while conversely the gene galr <dig> exhibited higher expression in the russet peel  <cit> . in apple, the comparison of bulk transcriptomic profiles from russeted and waxy genotypes, showed that gene model mdp <dig> and its putative homeologous on lg <dig>  were greatly under-expressed in russeted cultivars at harvest time  <cit> . though supporting the hypothesis of a principal role in russeting control unrolled by abc transporters both in pear and apple, these data were obtained from  <dig> and 150 days old fruits, respectively, representing a single snapshot of exocarp transcriptome during fruit growth, without considering early development stages. russeting occurs early in rgt fruits, concomitantly with the cell division phase and initial part of cell expansion phase during which a relative growth peak rate is normally observed in apple  <cit> . although the predicted gene model mdp <dig> might represent a strong candidate for russeting control, neither the role of other genes annotated within the ru_rgt locus nor the presence of cultivar specific genes not shared with the reference genome can be excluded.

conservation of the haplotypic region in different russet cultivars
the molecular analysis in a panel of  <dig> apple cultivars, including full, moderate and non-russeted genotypes, revealed that the full rgt haplotype was carried only by 6/ <dig> russeted cultivars. some of them could have a common origin because they come from the italian germplasm but only two of them  cluster close to rgt  <cit> . the close relationship between rgt and ‘pum rusnein’ was also confirmed by our kinship analysis. the lack of evident relatedness of the remaining cultivars of this group, that share the same ru_rgt haplotype and must share in turn a common ancestor, could be explained by the fact that they could be several generations away from each other. the scenario offered by the haplotypes of the remaining cultivars, that do not share the rgt haplotype, appears rather complex. some close relationships with gd were expected because gd is in the pedigree of both ‘gala’   <cit>  and ‘daligris’, being mutant of ‘pinova’, . furthermore, an involvement of gd in the unknown pedigree of ‘herefordshire russet’ can be postulated. the presence of alleles flanking the ru_rgt gene in some cultivars could be explained through recombination that could have occurred in their pedigree. the fact that some of these alleles were found also in one of the non-russeted controls  also suggest that some of these alleles could be rather common in apple germplasm. other russet-controlling loci not present or not expressed in rgt could therefore be postulated to explain the absence of the whole ru_rgt haplotype, or at least the alleles of the markers udmdssr_ <dig> and udmdssr_ <dig> most tightly linked to the locus in ten russeted genotypes. duplicated loci controlling specific traits carried by different chromosomes are common in apple and this is due to apple polyploidization demonstrated by the recently published genome sequence  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a major qtl controlling apple peel russeting on lg <dig> of the russet cultivar rgt is reported in our work. a fine mapping approach narrowed the locus approximately to a  <dig> kb interval, according to the reference apple genome. gene annotation in this region revealed a potential candidate for russeting control, an abc transporter likely involved in cuticle organization. further studies are however needed to confirm identification of the genetic determinant and its role in russeting control. molecular markers closely linked to the ru_rgt gene were developed to help marker assisted selection at least in rgt crosses, considering that several russet cultivars did not carry the allele suggested for the molecular selection.
