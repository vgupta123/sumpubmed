BACKGROUND
spermatozoa are one of the most morphologically diverse cells across animal taxa  <cit> , with sizes ranging from 8 μm in the hymenoptera meteorus sp.  <cit>  to 58 mm in drosophila bifurca  <cit> . such large variation in sperm morphology has presented a conundrum to sexual selection studies. most of the efforts were put into identifying interspecific differences in the mean values of sperm morphology , though ward  <cit>  stressed that there is large intraspecific variation in sperm morphology. further studies investigated such within-species, among-male variation in sperm traits , and many of them suggested that post-copulatory sexual selection is an important selective pressure in reducing the levels of among-male variation in sperm morphology. although within-male variation in sperm has also been reported in some studies , what causes and maintains within-male variation in sperm morphology has been seldom explored.

there exist several non-mutually exclusive explanations as to why sperm can vary within ejaculates. a conflict between the diploid  and the haploid genome  has been predicted to result in morphological variation  <cit> . however, diploid genes are the main determinants of sperm morphology  <cit> , and the optima for the diploid and haploid phenotype tend to be similar under strong sperm competition  <cit> . production of large sperm numbers has been shown to be associated with more numerous errors in sperm production  <cit> , suggesting that inevitable developmental errors can partly maintain within male variation. it has also been suggested that sperm competition could lead to the evolution of different sperm phenotypes that play different roles in the ejaculate  <cit> , thus resulting in a mixed strategy ejaculate. alternatively, birkhead et al.  <cit>  hypothesized that as the intensity of sperm competition is relaxed, males could afford lower sperm production control . comparative studies have found support for the latter hypothesis  <cit> , arguing that sperm competition exerts strong stabilizing selection towards optima in sperm design – e.g., the relationship between different sperm sections. while comparative studies stress the role of sperm competition in reducing intraspecific among-male variation, the levels of within-male variation do not seem to follow evident patterns .

in species where the access to fertile females differs across males, theory predicts that non-favoured males should invest more resources in the production of high quality ejaculates . further, sperm morphology and design have been correlated with male fertilizing success, and thus they might be important components of ejaculate quality . two models predict that a continuous increase in costs to obtain a mate should select for continuously increasing resource investment in the production of high quality ejaculates, i.e., the soma/germline allocation trade-off hypothesis  <cit> . in species where access to fertile females is determined by social dominance, we propose that the amount of within-male variation in sperm morphology will depend on male social status. thus, based on the soma/germline allocation trade-off, we predict that as males are less dominant they should exhibit lower within-male variation in sperm morphology resulting from higher resource investment in sperm production control.

house sparrows passer domesticus are socially monogamous birds with levels of extra-pair paternity ranging between 12-15% , and in this species, social hierarchies covary with male reproductive behaviours and male access to fertile females . moreover, a previous study on house sparrows reported a large amount of within-male variation, which, for some sperm traits, exceeded between-male variation  <cit> . further, a more recent study found that dominant house sparrow males produce ejaculates of lower quality compared to those produced by males in the middle of the hierarchy, which results from lower resource investment in the protection of ejaculates against oxidative stress  <cit> . to test whether male dominance explains levels of within-male variation in sperm design, we maintained  <dig> wild male and  <dig> wild female house sparrows in outdoor aviaries, and investigated within-male variation in sperm design according to social rank after a 4-week acclimation period. to further test the causality of the observed patterns, we experimentally manipulated the social status of males in a way that optimized the number of males going up or down the hierarchy. in this study, we defined sperm design as the first principal component of a pca using sperm head, midpiece, and flagellum length. our measure of sperm design described spermatozoa in terms of the relative length of their midpiece and flagellum compared to the length of their head, the former two being negatively related to the latter.

RESULTS
before manipulating the social status
we found that males at different social ranks differed significantly in their within-ejaculate variation in sperm design , with dominant and subordinate- <dig> males exhibiting larger within-ejaculate variance in sperm design. social status did not explain variation in total sperm length . however, we found that variation in total sperm length varied non-additively according to the social status and the body mass , and this relation remained after removing a potential outlier due to a very light-weight subordinate- <dig> male with large variation in total sperm length . the relation between variation in total sperm length and body mass was significant and positive for dominant males only , and this remained true when removing the potential outlier. additionally, pairwise comparisons revealed that the relation between variation in total sperm length and body mass differed significantly between dominant vs. subordinate- <dig> males , dominant vs. subordinate- <dig>  and subordinate- <dig> vs. subordinate- <dig> males . however, after removing the potential outlier the difference between subordinate- <dig> vs. subordinate- <dig> was no longer statistically significant .fig.  <dig> relationship between variation in sperm design  according to social rank before manipulating the social status

after manipulating the social status
in order to address causal relationships between variation in sperm design and social status, we manipulated social ranks by shuffling males across aviaries. this resulted in many males sharing similar social ranks within the new groups, which prompted males to move up or down in the hierarchy. after manipulating the social status, we found that social status did not explain the level of variation in sperm design nor in total sperm length anymore . we also found no correlation between body mass and variation in sperm design or total sperm length .table  <dig> lmms investigating how experimentally changing the social status affects the within-ejaculate variation in sperm design or in total sperm length

relation between within-male variance in sperm morphology and sperm performance
before manipulating the social status, we found that the proportion of motile sperm correlated negatively with the amount of within-ejaculate variation in sperm design  and variation in total sperm length . however, sperm swimming ability was correlated neither with within-ejaculate variation in sperm design  nor within-ejaculate variation in total sperm length .fig.  <dig> relationship between the proportion of motile sperm in the ejaculate and  the within-ejaculate variation in sperm design or  the within-ejaculate variation in total sperm length before manipulating the social rank. the lines represent linear regressions




after manipulating the social status, we found that sperm swimming ability was negatively correlated with the amount of within-ejaculate variation in total sperm length . however, we found no correlation between percentage of motile sperm and variation in sperm design or total sperm length , nor between sperm swimming ability and within-ejaculate variation in sperm design .

discussion
in the present study, we found that the dominant and the most subordinate  males exhibited greater within-ejaculate variation in sperm morphology and design than males at intermediate positions  . in addition, we found several negative correlations between sperm performance and within-ejaculate variation in sperm morphology and design . lastly, we found that heavier dominant and subordinate- <dig> males produced ejaculates with greater variation in sperm length compared to subordinate- <dig> and  <dig> males . previous studies have shown that males are able to adjust their ejaculate traits based on changes in their social environment , and previous studies on house sparrows have found that males can adjust their ejaculate quality in terms of percentage of motile sperm to changes in social status  <cit> . however, we did not observe any changes in the levels of variation in sperm design given the changes in social rank. while rapid changes in ejaculate function can be achieved by allocation of resources, which serve as protection for the ejaculate , or which enhance ejaculate functioning , adjustments in the spermatogenetic control might be more difficult to achieve after a single spermatogenetic cycle. the exact duration of a spermatogenesis cycle is unknown for our model species, but it is worth noting that it has been found to be between  <dig> and 15 days in non-passerine birds  <cit> , and possibly less in passerine birds  <cit> .

birkhead and colleagues  <cit>  found high levels of within-male variation in sperm morphology in male zebra finches, and they argued that the low levels of sperm competition in zebra finches may have led to relaxed pressures upon quality control processes in spermatogenesis, and thus the production of ejaculates with substantial variation in sperm morphology. while strong evidence for this hypothesis comes from interspecific comparative studies  <cit> , the production and maintenance of substantial intraspecific variation in sperm morphology is still not fully understood. our results are consistent with the hypothesis that dominant males, which are likely to have a privileged access to females, are under relaxed sperm competition pressures, and consequently may loosen the quality control they exert on spermatogenesis, hence producing ejaculates with greater variance in sperm morphology and design.

we also found that, similarly to dominant individuals, fully subordinate males produced ejaculates with larger amounts of variance in sperm morphology and design. although dominant and fully subordinate males share a common pattern of ejaculates variance in sperm morphology and design we propose that they may be subjected to different constraints or may respond to different selective pressures. dominant males may produce ejaculates with larger variance in sperm morphology and design as a result of  larger sperm production demands to meet higher copulation rates,  energy saving strategies, and/or  strategic allocation of resources between somatic and reproductive tissues. on the other hand, fully subordinate males might be under energetic constraints .

in soay rams, it has been shown that dominant males have higher copulation rates throughout the reproductive season, and therefore run sperm depleted and lose out in sperm competition at the end of the season  <cit> . in house sparrows, dominant males have higher copulation rates  <cit> , and may thus face higher needs for sperm production. however, sperm production is costly  <cit> , and increased sperm production may result in a larger number of errors  <cit> . a larger number of production errors would be reflected in a lower proportion of motile sperm  <cit> , and we indeed observed a negative correlation between within-male variation in both sperm design and total sperm length and proportion of motile sperm . however, these correlations were not maintained after manipulating male social status . thus, the hypothesis that increased variation in sperm design may result from a higher sperm demand in dominant, but not subordinate males still, deserves experimental investigations.

alternatively, theory predicts that males should differentially invest in pre- vs. post-copulatory traits depending on the risk of sperm competition they face  <cit> . the predictions of these models have been tested in various taxa, and evidence of such a pre- vs. post-copulatory investment trade-off exists  <cit> . in house sparrows, a recent study showed that dominant males produce ejaculates of lower quality compared to ejaculates of subordinate males, while this reflects differences in the resources used to protect ejaculates from oxidative damage  <cit> . birkhead and immler  <cit>  suggested that within-male variation in male design might result from individual differences of resource investment in spermatogenesis control, and thus the higher levels of within-male variation in sperm design by dominant males might be the result of differential investment in pre- vs. post-copulatory traits  <cit> . strikingly, males at the lower end of the hierarchy also showed high levels of within-male variation in sperm morphology . males at the lower end of the hierarchy might face a high risk of sperm competition, and thus may be expected to reduce their ejaculate expenditure at any given copulation  <cit> . yet, males facing a high intensity of sperm competition are still expected to increasingly invest resources in post-copulatory traits  <cit> , and thus they should be expected to invest in sperm production control. alternatively, subordinate- <dig> males might be unable to predict the fertility status of females, and thus might benefit from producing ejaculates with various sperm types . finally, males at the lower end of the hierarchy may rather be under energetic constraints due to the physiological costs of subordination  and/or their lower ability to outcompete other males to access resources, and thus they might by unable to invest in spermatogenesis control.

in house sparrows, body mass affects male dominance  <cit> , and smaller dominant males may face higher levels of male-male competition that may translate into higher risk of sperm competition. further, smaller males seem to pay higher physiological costs when they are dominant  <cit> . interestingly, we found that the lighter the males occupying higher social ranks  were, the lower the variance in sperm morphology in the ejaculates they produced. this supports the idea that among dominant males the less competitive males may increase their investment in ejaculate quality to reduce variation in sperm morphology , and hence increase the competitive ability of their ejaculates. however, whether slight differences in male competitiveness among higher ranking males result in differences in ejaculate quality remains to be experimentally tested.

CONCLUSIONS
different evolutionary processes may explain levels of morphological variation between taxa and within taxa  <cit> , and sperm competition seems to cause stabilizing selection that leads to lower variation in sperm design across taxa . however, at the intraspecific level, we suggest that in species where males face different risks of sperm competition, they may flexibly adjust their investment in gamete production resulting in differences in the levels of within-male variation in sperm morphology that better fit their risks of sperm competition. alternatively, males may invest equal amounts of resources in either producing small volumes of high quality ejaculates or large volumes of lower quality ejaculates. these two alternative hypotheses remain to be tested to better understand how high levels of intraspecific variation in sperm morphology and design are maintained. furthermore, repeated samples of the same individuals would allow distinguishing within-male, between ejaculate variation from within-male, within-ejaculate variation to precisely address the various levels of variation. lastly, experiments exploring the consequences of different levels of within-male variation in sperm design under sperm competition are needed to better understand male reproductive strategies.
