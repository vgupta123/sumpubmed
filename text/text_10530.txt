BACKGROUND
environmental factors such as low temperature, drought, and salinity are the major abiotic stress factors that adversely affect the growth and development of plants limiting crop productivity  <cit> . freezing stress affects plant growth directly by the inhibition of metabolic reactions and indirectly through osmotic, oxidative and other secondary stresses.

a number of chemicals have been tested for inducing freezing tolerance. whereas exogenous application of cryoprotectants such as sorbitol and polyethylene glycol were found to be either phyto-toxic or only marginally effective in imparting frost tolerance  <cit> , chemicals such as choline chloride and ethanolamine have been shown to be effective in improving frost tolerance, in wheat and tomato seedlings, respectively  <cit> . more recently, some acrylic compounds were found to protect crops from freezing damage by forming an inert layer on the plant surface  <cit> . however, the environmental safety of these chemicals and their impact on various ecosystems is unclear. therefore, the identification of naturally occurring plant-based products to impart freezing stress tolerance to crop plants would be ideal.

extracts of ascophyllum nodosum, have been shown to stimulate shoot growth and branching  <cit> , increase root growth and lateral root development  <cit> , improve nutrient uptake  <cit> , enhance resistance to diseases  <cit> , and mitigate the effects of environmental stresses such as drought, salinity and frost  <cit> . burchett et al.  <cit>  reported that application of a commercial formulation of a. nodosum extract enhanced winter hardiness and increased frost resistance in winter barley. another study in grapes using an extract of the tasmanian giant bull kelp durvillea potatorum ] also improved plant freezing tolerance  <cit> .

the role of proline in low temperature tolerance in plants has been reported  <cit>  and a number of plant species, that are inherently tolerant to freezing temperatures , accumulate high levels of proline when exposed to low temperatures  <cit> . proline plays multiple roles in frost tolerance; such as a mediator of osmotic adjustment  <cit> , stabilizer of proteins and membranes  <cit> , inducer of osmotic stress-related genes  <cit> , scavenger of reactive oxygen species   <cit> , source of reduction equivalents during stress recovery  <cit> , and readily available source of nitrogen and carbon during post-recovery growth  <cit> .

in an earlier study, we demonstrated that a. nodosum extracts  and its lipophilic component  significantly enhanced freezing tolerance in arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . electrolyte leakage measurements revealed that the lt <dig> value of lpc treated plants was lowered by 3°c while cell viability staining demonstrated a 30-40% reduction in area of damaged tissue in extract treated plants as compared to water controls. additionally, ane treatment caused a two-fold increase in the transcription of the cold response genes, cor15a, rd29a and transcription factor cbf <dig> 

several expression profile studies in arabidopsis have established that large scale changes occur in gene expression during cold acclimation and subsequent freezing tolerance  <cit> . freezing temperatures activate a number of cold-responsive genes which encode a diverse array of proteins such as dehydrins, lipid transfer proteins, molecular chaperones, anti-freeze proteins, enzymes involved in respiration and metabolism of carbohydrates, phenylpropanoids and antioxidants, late-embryogenesis-abundant proteins and others, each with a presumed function in tolerance to the dehydration caused by freezing  <cit> .

microarrays provide an advantage of allowing parallel quantification of the gene expression at the whole genome level. here, we report changes in the metabolome and global transcript profile in plants, after treatment with the lpc and subsequent exposure to freezing temperatures and post-freezing recovery.

RESULTS
proline estimation
plants treated with ane or lpc accumulated higher amounts of proline during freezing stress, as compared to water controls . freezing stress was initiated by spraying plants with ice-cold water in an incubator set at 0°c and progressively cooled at the rate of 1°c per 24h until desired temperature was reached. the proline content of control plants after exposure to a freezing stress of 0°c for  <dig> h was  <dig>  micro moles g- <dig> fresh weight versus  <dig>  micro moles g- <dig> fresh weight in lpc treated plants. at this temperature, plants treated with ane did not show a significant change in proline content, as compared to control plants. however, when plants were exposed to −2°c for  <dig> h, ane- and lpc-treated plants accumulated higher amounts of proline  as compared to the untreated plants . a further lowering of temperature to −4°c did not significantly affect proline accumulation in any of the treatments. during thawing, arabidopsis plants accumulated large amounts of proline amounting to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  micro moles g- <dig> fresh weight in control, ane- and lpc-treated plants, respectively. overall, lpc treated plants accumulated significantly higher amounts of proline at all temperatures .

transcriptional analysis of proline biosynthesis and degradation genes
analysis of transcript abundance for genes involved in proline biosynthesis  and degradation  in −2°c treatments revealed that ane and lpc treatment affected the expression of these genes . there was a two-fold increase in p5cs <dig> and a four-fold increase in p5cs <dig> transcripts as compared to plants that did not receive lpc treatment. a marginal decrease in the expression of prodh was also observed .

proline mutant studies
the role of proline in ane-mediated freezing tolerance in arabidopsis, was confirmed by using p5cs- <dig> mutants, deficient in proline accumulation during stress. observations of p5cs- <dig> mutants revealed that application of ane and lpc did not alter the sensitive phenotype of p5cs- <dig> mutants . when the temperature was lowered to − <dig> °c, the wild-type, water control plants showed 100% mortality, while the wild-type plants treated with lpc showed considerably less damage and were able to recover from stress-induced damage .

soluble sugar estimation and sugar mutant studies
wild-type plants treated with ane or lpc accumulated higher amounts of total soluble sugars in response to freezing stress, as compared to untreated controls . at -2°c, ane-treated plants showed an almost two-fold increase in soluble sugars  while plants treated with lpc showed a  <dig> -fold increase  as compared to untreated controls . levels of soluble sugars remained unchanged in the treated and control plants at −4°c. soluble sugar concentrations were significantly higher in treated plants , as compared to untreated controls  .

confirmation of the role of soluble sugars in ane-mediated freezing tolerance using arabidopsis mutant sfr4
the extent of tissue damage in sfr <dig> mutants revealed that ane or lpc failed to impart freezing tolerance to plants which are defective in sugar accumulation . mutant plants treated with ane or lpc showed similar levels of damage to untreated controls when exposed to freezing temperatures . at − <dig> °c, 92% of the leaf area of control plants was damaged, compared to 90% and 87% in ane- and lpc-treated plants, respectively. the percentage area of tissue damage was 96% and 95%, respectively, for ane and lpc treated plants at a temperature of − <dig> °c, while it was 97% for control plants . these results confirm that sugar accumulation is essential in the development of ane-mediated freezing tolerance in arabidopsis.

1h nmr metabolite profiles of ane extracts
application of lpc elicited significant changes in the metabolome of arabidopsis in response to freezing stress. at ambient temperature, the application of ane or lpc had minimal effect on the metabolic profile of arabidopsis. however, when exposed to −2°c for  <dig> h, significant increases in peaks with 1h nmr chemical shifts  at  <dig>  to  <dig> ,  <dig>  to  <dig> ,  <dig>  to  <dig> , and  <dig>  to  <dig>  ppm were observed in the plants treated with lpc, as compared to control . during the thawing period, the changes in peak intensities were observed at resonances similar to freezing treatment , but the peak intensity increases were much lower than during freezing treatment. in order to better understand the metabolite changes resulting from lpc treatment, 2d nmr experiments such as cosy, tocsy, hsqc, and hmbc were run on samples from lpc, treated plants. the proton and carbon connectivity information revealed by these 1h-1h or 1h-13c correlation spectra indicated that the major metabolite changes are due to unsaturation of fatty acids  and sugar or sugar alcohols  .

global transcriptional changes elicited by ane
the transcript level changes during the post freezing recovery period were analyzed in ane-treated arabidopsis plants thawed at 4°c for 24h after a freezing treatment of −2°c for 24h . lpc treatment affected the expression of about 5%  of the arabidopsis genome  when, exposed to −2°c for 24h . using the gene expression data from control plants as the calibrator data set, we determined that about 2%  of the differentially expressed genes were up-regulated and 3%  were down-regulated during freezing stress. during post freezing recovery period, examination of the expression ratios of genes indicated that a relatively small portion of the genome was differentially expressed in plants treated with lpc as compared to controls. we found that  <dig> genes  were differentially expressed more than  <dig>  fold  with  <dig> genes  up-regulated and  <dig> genes  genes down-regulated during post freezing recovery period .

functional classification
the genes that were differentially expressed during freezing or post-freezing recovery were classified into different functional categories, using the web-based tool classification super-viewer, blast searches, and literature reports. the gene lists were classified according to the absolute gene number and normalized frequency. genes associated with abiotic or biotic stimuli, transcription factor activity, response to stress, etc. ranked highest among the up-regulated genes , while those responsible for extra-cellular, cell wall, receptor binding, etc. ranked highest among down-regulated genes during freezing stress . during the post-freezing recovery period, functional classification of the differentially expressed genes showed an opposite trend to that of freezing, with extra-cellular, dna-rna metabolism, cell wall, etc. ranking highest in the up-regulated ones  while response to abiotic and biotic stimuli, response to stress, cell wall, etc. in down-regulated ones .

when the genes were classified according to the actual number of genes which were differentially expressed, ‘unknown category’  ranked at the top , indicating there are many genes altered by treatment with lpc during freezing stress and post-freezing recovery period. a list of selected differentially expressed genes  and their functional categories are given in tables  <dig> and  <dig> 

pathway analysis
lpc-mediated differential gene expression in arabdopsis
standardized aracyc-defined metabolic pathways were used to study the metabolic changes in lpc-treated arabidopsis plants during freezing and post-freezing recovery. to examine the similarities and differences in the concerned metabolic pathways during the freezing stress and post-freezing recovery periods, entire biosynthetic pathways of arabidopsis were analyzed. during freezing, out of the total  <dig> genes which were differentially expressed ,  <dig> genes were identified by the pathway tools omics viewer, and of these  <dig> genes were assigned specific pathway. on the other hand,  <dig> genes out of total  <dig> genes were identified and  <dig> genes were assigned pathway during the post freezing recovery period. we found that specific pathways were affected significantly by lpc treatment, with little overlap during freezing and post-freezing recovery . the major known pathways found to be affected were soluble sugar accumulation, lipid metabolism, hormonal balance, flavanoid/terpene biosynthesis, proline degradation, and energy homeostasis .

major changes observed were the multi-step promotion of the starch degradation pathway , inactivation of sucrose degradation , induction of galactose degradation pathways i & ii , stimulation of raffinose/stachyose biosynthesis , and down-regulation of trehalose synthesis , and gluconeogenesis  .

a major pathway involved in galactolipid biosynthesis and lipid trafficking in thylakoid membranes  was specifically affected . other changes in lipid metabolism included down-regulation of sterol/cholesterol biosynthesis , and down regulation of long chain fatty acid synthesis . additionally, the salicylic acid biosynthesis pathway was found to be stimulated in ane-treated plants upon exposure to freezing stress. at1g <dig>  which encodes a protein with isochorismate synthase activity, was found to be activated during freezing stress . mutant studies of this gene's function suggest that its function is redundant with that of ics <dig> . moreover, a udp-glycosyltransferase  which is induced by salicylic acid during biotic stress, was also found to be activated during this period. on the other hand, the isochorismate synthase gene, ics <dig>  was found to be specifically down-regulated during post-freezing recovery.

during freezing, the hormonal balance pathway responsible for conjugation of cytokinins involving n-glucosylation was highly induced while the same pathway was specifically down-regulated during the post-freezing recovery period. udp-glycosyltransferases like ugt73b <dig>  ugt76c <dig>  ugt76c <dig>  at2g <dig>  and at1g <dig> were highly affected by the treatment. down-regulation of the gibberellin inactivation pathway was also observed, with ga2-oxidase , a dioxygenase involved in ga inactivation being specifically down-regulated.

a polyamine biosynthetic gene  involved in spermine/spermidine biosynthesis was up-regulated in lpc treated plants. pathway analysis of proline dehydrogenase , the gene involved in degradation of proline, showed that application of lpc down-regulated the gene thereby maintaining a higher level of proline throughout the freezing and post-freezing recovery periods. the ascorbate biosynthetic gene , involved in the response to jasmonic acid stimulus , and l-aspartate oxidase , involved in the early steps of nad biosynthesis, were both up-regulated. thus, the free radical scavenging pathway was also found to be activated. furthermore, genes responsible for flavanoid biosynthesis  and glucosylation  were up-regulated, while monoterpene  and glucosynalate  biosynthetic genes were down-regulated by freezing stress in plants treated with lpc .

specificity of lpc treatment at the transcriptional level
a rather limited gene overlap was found between the ane treatment and the control, as shown in the venn diagram . when the gene lists were mined for common candidates during freezing and thawing, there were only two and  <dig> genes in common in the up- and down-regulated classes, respectively. a list of common genes which showed a similar pattern of expression  during freezing and post-freeze thawing are given in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

heat map
to get a broad overview of the expression pattern of individual genes during freezing and post-freezing recovery, a heat map was generated using the web-based tool, heat mapper plus. a representative sample of the heat map of the global changes in the transcript levels of genes during freezing and the post-freezing recovery period is given in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

verification of microarray data by quantitative rt–pcr
several transcripts of selected up-regulated genes based on microarray analysis were quantified independently by rt–pcr . they include a glycolipid transportor , vq motif-containing protein , aba responsive zinc finger family protein , galactinol synthase , a drought-repressed protein , the cell wall protein precursor , an expansin protein , a gibberellin-responsive protein , the lipid transfer protein  , and an invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor . the rt–pcr results of all  <dig> genes showed similar differential expression patterns to those obtained by microarray analysis .

discussion
the results presented in this paper show that lipophilic components of a. nodosum extracts  induced specific biochemical changes leading to enhanced tolerance to freezing stress in arabidopsis thaliana. lpc-treatment of the roots resulted in enhanced freezing tolerance in the aerial parts of the plant, which implicates lpc in inducing systemic metabolic responses.

proline is one of several compounds with roles as compatible solutes that accumulate in response to freezing and drought stress,  <cit>  and osmotic stress  <cit> . our results on the quantification of proline accumulation in wild-type and lpc treated arabidopsis plants showed that application of ane or lpc, resulted in a 50% increase in free proline in response to freezing, as compared to control plants.

in higher plants, proline is synthesized via the glutamate pathway or the ornithine pathway  <cit> . the glutamate pathway is predominant during abiotic stress and under nitrogen limiting conditions  <cit> , while the ornithine pathway takes effect under nitrogen abundance  <cit> . plants accumulate proline in response to freezing-induced osmotic stress by simultaneous activation of proline biosynthesis  and/or down regulation of proline degradation   <cit> . the reciprocal regulation of the Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase , a rate-limiting enzyme in proline biosynthesis, and proline dehydrogenase , responsible for proline degradation, is a key mechanism in the control of cytosolic proline concentration  <cit> .

the results of our experiments with p5cs <dig> mutant plants confirmed the role of proline in ane-mediated freezing tolerance, in that the p5cs <dig> mutants, treated with ane, lpc and the water control, all showed similar freezing damage. these observations were in agreement with the results of the gene expression studies. results of the gene expression analysis suggested that increased proline concentration in the lpc-treated plants was a result of a coordinated increase in p5cs <dig> and p5cs <dig> transcripts and, in part, due to decreased in prodh.

several studies have suggested that cold-induced sugar accumulation enhances the degree of plant freezing tolerance. in arabidopsis, a large increase in the degree of freezing tolerance is positively correlated with soluble sugar content  <cit> . similarly, increased sucrose levels in transgenic arabidopsis plants, over-expressing a gene for sucrose phosphate synthase, equated with freezing tolerance  <cit> . conversely, sensitive to freezing  <dig>  mutants exhibited an impaired freezing tolerance response due to a reduced accumulation of sugar levels at low temperature relative to the wild type  <cit> . in lpc-treated plants, increased accumulation of soluble carbohydrates was brought about by multiple mechanisms such as inducing polysaccharide degradation , promoting the biosynthesis of soluble carbohydrates , and inactivating the sucrose degradation pathways.

recently, uemura et al.  <cit>  showed that the sensitivity of the arabidopsis mutant sfr <dig> to freezing was due to its low sugar content, as manifested by loss of osmotic responsiveness. additionally, it has been demonstrated that exogenous sucrose, at low concentrations, serves as a substrate for low temperature-induced metabolic alterations, while at higher concentrations it has a direct cryoprotective effect on cellular membranes  <cit> . although an increased concentration of cytosolic soluble sugar has been observed in response to freezing-induced osmotic stress, in many plant species  <cit> , it is unclear whether the accumulated sugars act as osmolytes, or serve as a source of energy and carbon, that fuels the metabolic changes leading to enhanced freezing tolerance  <cit> .

a positive correlation between sugar accumulation and freezing tolerance has been widely documented in many plant species, including arabidopsis  <cit> . in the present study, application of ane or lpc resulted in a significantly enhanced accumulation of total soluble sugars in response to freezing, as compared to untreated controls. the results were further strengthened by analyzing the sensitivity of sfr <dig> mutant plants to freezing.

1h nmr analysis of the arabidopsis metabolome, during freezing, revealed that the application of lpc altered biochemical pathways resulting in the accumulation of specific metabolites, leading to enhanced freezing tolerance. the 1h nmr spectra of plants treated with lpc was dominated by peaks with chemical shifts  around  <dig>  to  <dig>  ppm. these chemical shifts primarily represented  <dig> major groups of compounds;  <dig>  –  <dig>  ppm represents lipophilic components like fatty acids and sterols, while resonance at  <dig>  to  <dig>  ppm represented carbohydrates, sugars, sugar alcohols and organic acids  <cit> . our results are in agreement with previous reports. these findings showed that multiple primary metabolites could act collectively, as compatible solutes, ameliorating the osmotic stress caused by freezing.

1h nmr peaks with chemical shifts  around  <dig>  to  <dig>  ppm, represented the lipophilic components such as fatty acids and sterols, were another major group of metabolites which showed specific changes during freezing stress in lpc-treated plants. fatty acids are major components of cellular membranes, suberin, and cutin waxes that provide structural barriers to the environment. at low temperature, plant membranes undergo a transition from a liquid crystalline state to a gel-like phase with reduced fluidity contributing to ion leakage and deactivation of membrane proteins  <cit> . fatty acids contribute to inducible stress resistance through the remodeling of membrane fluidity  <cit> . the ability to adjust membrane fluidity by modulating levels of unsaturated fatty acids is a feature of freezing-tolerant plants. fatty acid unsaturation is thought to reduce the propensity of cellular membranes to undergo freezing-induced, non-bilayer phase formation, thus enhancing membrane integrity and cellular function during freezing  <cit> .

metabolite profiling revealed an increase in unsaturated fatty acids in plants treated with lpc when exposed to freezing. the spectral peaks  at δ =  <dig> - <dig>  ppm ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> - <dig>  ppm , and  <dig> - <dig>  ppm  are indicative of unsaturation of fatty acid. we have previously reported that application of ane or lpc resulted in less tissue damage and electrolyte leakage, as compared to controls, thereby improving the lt <dig> values  <cit> . the metabolite profiles suggested that that lpc-mediated freezing tolerance in arabidopsis may be the result of a combination of metabolic adjustments and increased fatty acid content in arabidopsis.

chemical components in the extracts of a. nodosum caused a rapid biochemical response leading to an increased accumulation of osmoprotectants  and unsaturated fatty acids. the results of the present study suggested that application of these extracts elicited responses reminiscent of a priming effect. priming is a phenomenon whereby previous exposure to biotic or abiotic stress stimuli makes a plant more resistant to future incidents  <cit> . chemical priming is a novel strategy, wherein application of certain chemicals mimic moderate stress stimuli, through physiological and/or hormonal reactions and brings about a priming reaction in the target plants. exogenous application of chemicals inducing a priming effect, in abiotic stress tolerance has been previously reported  <cit> . application of a non-protein amino acid, β-aminobutyric acid , was shown to induce a priming response in arabidopsis towards salt stress tolerance  and salicylic acid-dependent disease tolerance   <cit> . the results presented in this paper suggest the possibility of a chemical priming effect in arabidopsis, as a reaction to the application of ane or lpc, resulting in enhanced freezing tolerance.

further, we used a whole-genome approach to determine the ane-mediated freezing tolerance in arabidopsis plants. application of lpc significantly altered gene expression for 1% of the arabidopsis genes. in this study, we focused on gene expression related to three aspects:  response to stress and/or stress stimulus;  compatible osmolyte accumulation;  changes in membrane lipid profile in response to stress.

around  <dig> annotated genes were found to be up-regulated in our focus category with four genes  found to be directly involved in low temperature stress tolerance in arabidopsis  <cit> . another major group of induced genes was those expressed in response to osmotic stress . the ability to survive periods of desiccation is an important adaptation to freezing temperatures and many of the ‘water-deprivation controlled’ genes are also required for maximum survival during freezing stress  <cit> . many of the genes expressed during cold acclimation are also inducible by drought stress, and are likely to play a role in protection against cellular dehydration, which occurs during both freezing and drought conditions  <cit> . this finding is consistent with previous observations, that those plants which are able to efficiently manage osmotic stress, are more tolerant to freezing temperatures  <cit> .

genes activated in response to biotic stress and/or stimuli were also activated owing to the fact that both biotic and abiotic stress stimuli share a common signaling cascade to bring about physiological responses  <cit> . for example, salicylic acid  has long been known as a signal molecule in the induction of defense mechanisms in plants  <cit> . exogenous application of sa has been shown to improve freezing tolerance in wheat by regulating the ice nucleation activity of apoplastic proteins  <cit> . ding et al.  <cit>  have shown that  <dig>  mm methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate treatment improved the cold tolerance of tomato fruits. moreover, sa was shown to accumulate during low temperatures in chilling-resistant arabidopsis plants  <cit> .

similarly, several studies have suggested that cold-induced sugar accumulation enhances the degree of plant freezing tolerance. in arabidopsis, a large increase in the degree of freezing tolerance is positively correlated with soluble sugar content  <cit> . increased sucrose levels in transgenic arabidopsis plants over-expressing a gene for sucrose phosphate synthase equated with freezing tolerance  <cit> . conversely, sensitive to freezing  <dig>  mutants exhibited an impaired freezing tolerance response due to a reduced accumulation of sugar levels at low temperature, relative to the wild type  <cit> . in lpc-treated plants, increased accumulation of soluble carbohydrates was brought about by multiple mechanisms such as induction of polysaccharide degradation , promoting biosynthesis of soluble carbohydrates  and inactivating the sucrose degradation pathways.

starch is the main carbohydrate store in plants. regulation of starch metabolism, in particular in response to environmental cues, is of primary importance for carbon and energy flow in plants  <cit> . along with photosynthesis, starch degradation also plays a significant role in cold-induced sugar accumulation and enhanced freezing tolerance in arabidopsis  <cit> . starch-related glucan/water dikinases encoded by the arabidopsis ‘starch excess’  <dig> and  <dig> genes , regulate starch degradation in plastids by phosphorylating starch, thereby ensuring better accessibility by starch-degrading enzymes during cold induced starch degradation. sex <dig> plays an essential role in the cold-induced starch degradation, sugar accumulation, and freezing tolerance enhancement during an early phase of cold acclimation  <cit> . sex4/dsp <dig> phosphatase activity has been shown to be regulated by the redox state  <cit>  and unfavourable environmental stress conditions alter the redox balance within the cells. it is believed that sex4/dsp <dig> phosphatase activity may be regulated in response to environmental stress and might be associated to msk4/atk- <dig>  a plastid-localized protein kinase associated with starch granules, which is an important regulator that adjusts carbohydrate metabolism during environmental stress  <cit> . sex  <dig> and sex  <dig> were found to be activated in lpc-treated plants during freezing stress, as compared to control plants.

raffinose family oligosaccharides  such as raffinose and stachyose are accumulated during the process of cold acclimation, when plants acquire increased frost tolerance  <cit> . arabidopsis plants with higher rates of raffinose biosynthesis demonstrated increased accumulation of raffinose and galactinol upon cold acclimation and exhibited higher freezing tolerance  <cit> . molecular mechanisms by which rfos influence cellular freezing tolerance are not clear, but it has been shown previously that raffinose can stabilize isolated chloroplast thylakoid membranes during a freeze–thaw cycle  <cit> . galactinol synthase  catalyses the first committed step in the biosynthesis of rfos  <cit>  and, therefore its expression, provides an experimental tool to assess the level of rfos during freezing stress, to analyze the function of rfos as osmoprotectants  <cit> . lpc application stimulated the raffinose/stachyose biosynthetic genes gols <dig> and gols <dig> during freezing.

lpc treatment specifically induced a major pathway involved in galactolipid biosynthesis and lipid trafficking in thylakoid membranes controlled by the gene dgd <dig>  other changes include down-regulation of sterol/cholesterol biosynthesis, regulation of acyl-coa thioesterases and down regulation of long chain fatty acid synthesis .

membranes are the major injury sites during freezing stress  <cit> , and membrane lipids undergo substantial changes when plants are exposed to freezing temperatures  <cit> . it has been well established that membrane polar lipid composition is one of the important factors controlling the structure and efficiency of thylakoid membranes via specific lipid–protein interactions and/or the dynamic properties of the lipid bilayer  <cit> . the galactolipids constitute the bulk  of the thylakoid lipid matrix and, within green plant parts,  <dig> to 80% of the lipids are associated with photosynthetic membranes. during freezing, dramatic alterations take place in plastid membranes, decreasing the monogalactosyldiacylglycerol  content and increasing digalactosyldiacylglycerol  content  <cit> . the ratio of dgdg to mgdg is critical for correct protein folding, insertion and intracellular protein trafficking in the chloroplast  <cit>  during temperature stress  <cit> . dgd <dig>  is the enzyme involved in the conversion of mgdg to dgdg in photosynthetic membranes of the chloroplast  <cit> . the dgd <dig> mutant of arabidopsis was impaired in galactolipid assembly, as suggested by a 90% reduction in digalactosyl lipid content  <cit> . dgd <dig>  was found to be highly expressed in lpc-treated plants during freezing stress. taken together, it may be concluded that activation of digalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase  <dig>  resulted in efficient conversion of mgdg to dgdg, thereby maintaining improved stability of membranes and reduced ion leakage in lpc treated plants.

an early response to low temperature stimulus, by tolerant plant species like winter barley oats, is decreased in membrane fluidity  <cit> . a major adaptation among the winter tolerant species is the ability to maintain the fluidity of membranes by reducing the ratio of free sterol to total phospholipids. this is achieved by a decrease in the free sterols and an increase in the proportion of phospholipids  <cit> . sterol/cholesterol biosynthesis was found to be highly down regulated in lpc-treated plants during freezing stress. a further modification observed in the lipid metabolism of lpc treated plants was the regulation of acyl-coa thioesterase.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that lipophilic components of ane  modulated specific metabolic pathways in a. thaliana resulting in enhanced tolerance to freezing stress. response to stress and/or stress stimuli, accumulation of compatible osmoprotectants, and regulation of the membrane lipid profile, were the major adaptations observed in lpc-treated plants during freezing stress. there was little overlap in the genes involved in tolerance to freezing stress versus post freezing recovery, indicating the specificity of the mode of action of lpc during freezing stress. a number of genes in the ‘unknown category’  were differentially expressed, indicating that a number of potential genes had been altered by lpc treatment during freezing stress and post-f reezing recovery period. further studies are needed to dissect the specific genes identified in this study-involved in specific pathways of stress signaling/response, osmolyte accumulation, and lipid metabolism and their roles in a. nodosum extract-mediated, enhanced freezing tolerance in a. thaliana.
