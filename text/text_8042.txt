BACKGROUND
the gynoecium, located in the fourth and innermost whorl of a flower, is the female reproductive organ of flowering plants which has specialized functions for successful pollination, seed maturation and seed dispersal. although it is a highly complex organ that differs widely in form between species, most gynoecia of different angiosperms have a set of common structures: an apical stigma, a style, and a basal ovary, which encloses the ovules  <cit> . in brassicaceae family, including the model plant arabidopsis thaliana and important brassica crops, gynoecium is composed of two fused carpels and three common parts above. the stigma plays a key role in pollen binding and recognition and participates in the induction of pollen germination  <cit> . the style connects the stigma with the ovary and harbors the transmitting tract essential for pollen tube growth. the ovary contains the ovules that develop into seeds after fertilization  <cit> . the ovule contains the funiculus, the chalaza which forms outer and inner integuments, and the nucellus which is covered by the integuments and in which the embryo sac representing the megagametophyte forms  <cit> . incomplete or abnormal development in any part of gynoecium can cause female sterility or reduced fertility, which has been observed in various plants, including arabidopsis and brassica crops  <cit> . the female sterile mutants provide the suitable materials for elucidating the genetic control of the gynoecium development.

as the gynoecium is one of the most complex and important organs of flowering plants, increasing researches focused on the genetic control of its development by using female gametophytic mutants, especially from arabidopsis. several genes important for ovule integument or embryo sac development have been identified, such as sin <dig>  bel <dig>  ino, ats, ant, tso <dig>  hll, nzz, sin <dig>  wus, pfs <dig> <cit> , dyad <cit>  and vdd <cit> . in addition, it was proposed that adaxial–abaxial polarity mechanisms were required for integument formation  <cit> . the auxin concentration gradient was found to determine cell fates in the embryo sac  <cit> . two genes  were shown to control female gamete formation and megagametogenesis by two independent small rna pathways  <cit> . brassinolide was suggested to plays a previously unrecognized role in the development of gynoecia and outer integument of the ovule  <cit> . some other genes or gene families like sty, shi, hecate, shatterproof, jaiba, clv <dig> and spt were identified for gynoecium development, including stigma, style, septum, transmitting tract and carpel margin tissues  <cit> . recently, by applying whole genome microarray and next generation sequencing  techniques, hundreds of genes were found to be specific for female gametophyte genes by comparative expression profiling between wild plants and mutants  <cit> .

the female sterile mutants from spontaneous or artificial mutations were rarely reported in the important oilseed rape brassica napus l.  <cit> . in our pervious study, complete female sterility was observed in one brassica napus- orychophragmus violaceus addition line which contained all  <dig> chromosomes from b. napus and one or two copies of one particular chromosome from o. violaceus <cit> . it seemed that its pistils stopped to develop at early stage. so we inferred that certain genes related to early process of pistil formation on this alien chromosome silence the homologous genes in b. napus, or these alien genes interfere the normal pistil development of b. napus. in this study, we compared the developmental anatomy and transcript profiling using rna-seq technique of the gynoecia between the female sterile line and donor b. napus. a number of candidate genes and related pathways were revealed, which provided new insights into the genetic and biochemical controls for early stage of pistil development in b. napus. in addition, the sequence datasets serve as a valuable resource for novel gene discovery in o. violaceus.

RESULTS
developmental anatomy of female sterility and donor b. napus
the female sterile disomic addition line  with all  <dig> chromosomes from b. napus and two copies of the chromosome from o. violaceus produced the progenies with similar phenotype, except the different female fertilities, after it pollinated donor b. napus . the female sterile plants carried one or two copies of the o. violaceus chromosome , while female fertile plants had the same chromosome number as normal b. napus . the female sterile plants were indistinguishable from fertile ones during vegetative growth period, for they only failed to produce normal gynoecia . they showed completely female sterility, and produced no seeds after self-fertilization or pollinated by b. napus. but they developed normal petals and anthers with abundant stainable pollen grains , for h <dig> showed normal seed setting when pollinated by the female sterile plants. in comparison with h <dig>  the gynoecia of s <dig> were slow-growing and much shorter from early development stage  to flowering , and the pistils showed no indication of swelling from fertilization and fell off after the flowers opened some time . correspondingly, the flowering duration of s <dig> plants was prolonged till seed maturity of h <dig>  because they had no seed setting and produced more flowers. pollination analysis found that few pollen grains of itself or h <dig> could adhere and germinate on s <dig> stigmas 6 h after pollination . however, although pollen tubes could grow spirally over the surface of papillae cells , they hardly penetrated into stigmas or styles and then failed to reach abnormal ovules even  <dig> or 72 h after pollination . further observation showed that papilla cells on s <dig> stigmas were short, small and not fingerlike as those of h <dig> at maturation stage .

the developmental processes of the gynoecia in s <dig> and h <dig> were comparatively observed from the cleared ovules to determine the stage and tissue for the occurrence of the female sterility. in h <dig>  the gynoecia formation was characterized by the normal development of the ovule and embryo sac . in s <dig>  ovule primordia appeared normally from the placenta in which one megaspore mother cell  was included , and four daughter cells were produced from the meiotic division of one mcc in the ovule . but the integuments could not initiate or arrest at the initiative stage , and only a small protuberance at the chalaza region was left . then in incomplete embryo sacs, the four meiotic products showed several patterns of degradation: all degraded , one nucleus and three degenerated arranged in a line , a ray of residuum and two nuclei surrounded , and only one residue left in the nucellus . the location of residual cells at the micropylar end  but the functioning megaspore at the chalazal end suggested the change of the normal polarity of cell location in embryo sac. these anatomical investigations revealed that the embryo sac development might stop after the meiotic division of the mmcs.

illumina sequencing and mapping of transcripts
according to the morphology of different-stage gynoecia of s <dig> and h <dig> observed above, the development of their gynoecia in the flower buds < 2 mm matched each other, but deviation started in the flower buds ~2 mm with gynoecia ~ <dig>  mm, and expanded with the successive growth of flower buds . so the gynoecia from  <dig> -3 mm flower buds from s <dig> and h <dig> were collected for analysis of changes in gene expressions responsible for their different developmental patterns. from mrna sequencing,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were obtained from s <dig> and h <dig>  respectively, and  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  clean reads were left, after “dirty” raw reads were removed. to identify genes corresponding to reads in each library, the clean reads were aligned to the brassica_95k_unigene reference genome using the short oligonucleotide alignment program  <dig>  aligner, allowing for two bases mismatch. of the clean reads, more than 62% matched either to a unique or multiple genomic positions, and  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> uniquely matched reads were used for gene expression analysis of each library. the detailed alignment statistics was displayed in table  <dig> 

screening of differentially expressed genes 
after mapped to reference genome, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were identified and transcribed in s <dig> and h <dig>  respectively, suggesting that newly initiated transcription occurred in s <dig>  the  <dig> unigenes were overlapped between these two transcript libraries,  <dig> expressed only in s <dig> and  <dig> only in h <dig>  using false discovery rate  ≤  <dig>  and the absolute value of |log2ratio| ≥  <dig> as criteria,  <dig> unigenes exhibited different expressions between s <dig> and h <dig>  including both up-regulated and down-regulated genes in s <dig>  of the  <dig> up-regulated unigenes,  <dig> genes were uniquely expressed in s <dig>  and  <dig> of the  <dig> down-regulated unigenes expressed only in h <dig>  moreover,  <dig> unigenes were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated with |log2ratio| ≥  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were up- and down-regulated with |log2ratio| ≥  <dig>  respectively .

gene ontology analysis and pathway analysis of degs
to further clarify the functional differences between s <dig> and h <dig>  degs with the criteria of rpkm ≥  <dig> and fold change ≥  <dig> were annotated according to function annotation convention. gene ontology  categories were assigned to significant degs based on the tair go slim provided by blast2go . a total of  <dig> degs could be categorized into  <dig> categories  , involving metabolism, growth, development, catabolic and apoptosis. based on the molecular functions,  <dig> categories genes involved in protein binding , nucleotide binding , hydrolase activity , dna binding  and so on. regarding biological process, the genes were finally classified into  <dig> categories, the most over-represented go term was response to stress , followed by response to abiotic stimulus , catabolic process , response to biotic stimulus . there were several related processes, including flower development , cell growth , cell differentiation , photosynthesis , cell death , cell cycle  and pollination . among the cellular component categories, plastid  and plasma membrane  were the dominant groups, followed by mitochondrion , vacuole  and cell wall .

pathway analysis for the  <dig> unigenes was performed using hypergeometric test. a total of  <dig> different metabolic pathways were found with q ≤  <dig>  . the most represented pathways were linoleic acid metabolism , biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , metabolic pathways , glycolysis/gluconegenesis  and flavonoid biosynthesis .

bpathways with qvalue ≤  <dig>  are significantly enriched in degs.

degs specific to s <dig> and h <dig> plants
as s <dig> carried the alien o. violaceu chromosomes, it was understandable that degs specific to s <dig>  were more than those of h <dig> . significantly enriched go terms of the two sets of degs were listed in additional file 3: table s <dig> and additional file 4: table s <dig>  for the  <dig> ones, there were  <dig> enriched go terms including  <dig> mapped to biological process ontology,  <dig> mapped to molecular function ontology and  <dig> mapped to cellular component ontology. for the  <dig> ones, only  <dig> go terms  belonging to biological process ontology were significantly enriched. no go terms were specific to h <dig> plants for molecular function and cellular component.

degs for steroid biosynthesis and metabolic process
fifteen unigenes involved in steroid biosynthesis were differentially expressed between s <dig> and h <dig>  for phytosterol, twelve of the fifteen unigenes covered brassinosteroid  and stigmasterol biosynthesis, which were all down-regulated in s <dig> plants. these genes were identified to encode proteins lup <dig> , cas <dig> , smo <dig> , c- <dig> sterol reductase  , smo <dig> , dwarf <dig>  and dwarf <dig> . down-regulation of these genes could affect the normal biosynthesis of brassinosteroid, which might have a role in gynoecium and ovule development  <cit> . furthermore, one unigene  encoding a don-glucosyltransferase termed ugt73c <dig> involved in br metabolic process was observed to highly and only expressed in s <dig> plant  >19). in arabidopsis, the ugt73c <dig> was found to regulate br activity by catalyzing the 23-o-glucosylation of bl and castasterone, and overexpression of ugt73c <dig> resulted in br-deficient phenotypes  <cit> . in s <dig>  the br activity was likely reduced by both biosynthesis and metabolic process, and then affected the s <dig> gynoecium and ovule development.

degs involved in floral organ, embryo sac or ovule development
in the flower development go terms,  <dig> unigenes showed different expression levels. among  <dig> unigenes for floral organ or whorl development,  <dig> encoding abcb <dig> , shp <dig> , hec <dig>  and spt  were involved in carpel development  <cit> ,  <dig> encoding srs <dig>  and taa <dig>  in gynoecium development  <cit> , only  <dig> in sepal development instead of carpel or gynoecium development. all  <dig> female organ-related genes were down-regulated. in the degs, some others for embryo sac or ovule development were observed. for example, the genes encoding vdd  were found to be a direct target of the mads domain ovule identity complex and affect embryo sac differentiation in arabidopsis <cit> ; the gene encoding ago <dig>  was a putative effector of small rna  silencing pathways, an insertion of which inhibited the initiation of megagametogenesis  <cit> ; the gene which encoded a protein disulfide isomerase, pdil2- <dig> , its truncation would function in sporophytic tissues to affect ovule structure and impede embryo sac development, thereby disrupting pollen tube guidance  <cit> . in addition, the genes which encoded sep <dig> , pi , ap <dig> , eda <dig> , eda <dig>  were also involved in female gametophyte or ovule development  <cit> . most of these genes were down-regulated except ago <dig>  pi and eda <dig> 

verification of degs by qrt-pcr
to confirm that the unique-match genes from the illumina sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were indeed differentially expressed, a total of  <dig> genes were selected randomly from the degs related to flower development  for quantitative rt-pcr assays. with the gene-specific primers designed , the relative transcript levels in s <dig> and h <dig> were compared with those of rna-seq data . for  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes, qrt-pcr analysis revealed the same expression trends as the rna-seq data, despite some quantitative differences. among  <dig> of the  <dig> genes with different expression levels between s <dig> and h <dig> ,  <dig> were repressed,  <dig> induced, and  <dig> opposed to rna-seq in s <dig>  respectively. for example, jcvi_ <dig>  a transcription factor which regulated flower development, was up-regulated  <dig>  times in s <dig> than in h <dig> by qrt-pcr, nearly the same ratio as the one  from rna-seq. moreover, the six related genes, jcvi_ <dig> , jcvi_ <dig> , jcvi_ <dig> , jcvi_ <dig> , jcvi_ <dig>  and jcvi_ <dig> , showed the same expression trends revealed by qrt-pcr and rna-seq, confirming the reliability of rna-seq data.

discussion
in this study, complete and stable female sterility in b. napus mediated by one alien chromosome was characterized for its anatomy of gynoecium development and gene expressions. the female sterility was insensitive to the dosage of the alien chromosome from o. violaceus, because the gynoecium development was nearly the same in the plants with one or two copies of the alien chromosome. this chromosome also caused complete female sterility in the nullisomic line with one chromosome pair lost  of b. napus , suggesting that the genes on this alien chromosome for female sterility were still active in the altered genetic background of b. napus. these results indicated that the female sterile lines were valuable for elucidating the genetic mechanisms behind the gynoecium development for brassica crops and other crucifers.

phenotype of aberrant gynoecium
in crucifers, the pollen tube must breach the stigma surface and burrow through the extracellular matrix of the stigma epidermal cells and transmitting tract cells before reaching its ovule targets  <cit> . it grows typically through the foot to penetrate the stigmatic cuticle and then enters the outer layer of the stigmatic cell wall, which would require cutinase or esterase to break down the stigmatic cuticle and modify the cell walls  <cit> . in our s <dig> line, the failure of the pollen tubes to penetrate the stigma epidermal cells on the defective stigmatic papillae may be caused by the aberrant structure and component of the abortive papillae cell walls or the enzyme activities. on the other hand, two differentially expressed unigenes encoded the s locus glycoprotein   were observed, which were specific to h <dig> and showed large schange of gene expression level  >16). the slg was expressed specifically in the stigma epidermal cell wall and played a role in pollen-pistil interaction and pollen adhesion  <cit> . down-regulated expression of slg was in conformity with that the fewer pollen grains adhered on s <dig> stigma.

in arabidopsis thaliana, one of several ovule-defective mutants, the ant showed ovules without integument development and blocked megasporogenesis at tetrad stage  <cit> . in ovules of s <dig> plant, the integuments arrested at the initiative stage and presented a small protuberance at the chalaza region, which indicated that the inner integument could initiate but not grow and the outer integument did not developed. so the abortive stage of s <dig> was a little later than the ant mutant. consistently, the megasporogenesis was blocked after the tetrad stage and the megagametogenesis did not initiate in s <dig>  as the tetrad and degraded megaspore were observed but the functional megaspore never discovered. additionally, expression of ant gene showed no difference between s <dig> and h <dig>  suggesting that defective ovules in s <dig> may be caused by downstream genes of ant or other metabolic pathways.

global gene transcription changes related with female sterility
the fact that more unigenes appeared in s <dig>  than h <dig>  was obviously connected with the alien chromosomes from o. violaceus, suggesting that newly initiated transcription occurred in s <dig>  furthermore,  <dig> degs were induced or repressed by more than two folds in s <dig> plants compared with h <dig> plants, some of them were confirmed by the qrt-pcr analysis. as there were too many go enrichment terms when using hypergeometric test for the  <dig> unigenes, we chose the degs with rpkm ≥  <dig> and fold change ≥  <dig>  for the go functional categorization. there were several processes related to female sterile traits, including flower development, embryo sac development, gametophyte development, cell growth, cell differentiation, cell death, cell cycle, pollen-pistil interaction. one inexplicable phenomenon was that, in the ontology of biological process, the most over-represented go terms were responses to stress or stimulus, suggesting that significant changes of the stress-resistant reaction in female sterile plants happened. more than  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes without any annotation might have some novel functions.

genes and metabolism pathways for female sterility
go and pathway enrichment analysis of the degs revealed a number of important genes and metabolism pathways for gynoecium development in s <dig> plants. the first noticeable pathway was brassinosteroid  biosynthesis and metabolic process. brs have several physiological effects in plants, including cell elongation and division, vascular differentiation, flowering, pollen development, seed germination and photomorphogenesis  <cit> . a novel role for brs in gynoecium and ovule development was shown recently  <cit> . in our study, twelve differential unigenes were revealed for br biosynthesis, which encoded seven kinds of proteins  produced during the biochemical process from squalene to cycloartenol to campesterol to br . from the pathway of brassinosteroid biosynthesis, all of the twelve unigenes were notably down-regulated in s <dig> plant and could affect the normal biosynthesis of brassinosteroid. for br metabolism, only two genes were identified in arabidopsis. one encoded a don-glucosyltransferase termed ugt73c <dig>  which was found to regulate br activity by catalyzing the 23-o-glucosylation of bl and castasterone. overexpression of ugt73c <dig> resulted in br-deficient phenotypes  <cit> . another was bas <dig>  which encoded a cytochrome p <dig> enzyme capable of hydroxylating br to 26-oh-bl  <cit> . here, one unigenes  which encoded ugt73c <dig> was observed to highly and exclusively expressed in s <dig> plants  >19). then, potentially reduced br activity in s <dig> gynoecia may be the key reason for female sterility.

the second group of genes was those involved in adaxial/abaxial axis specification. recent studies have shown that adaxial–abaxial polarity mechanisms were required for integument formation  <cit> . at present, eight genes from three gene families were confirmed to determine adaxial/abaxial axis specification during the inner and outer integuments development: ino from yabby gene family, kan <dig>  kan <dig> and aberrant testa shape  from kanadi gene family, and four class iii homeodomain-leucine zipper  genes   <cit> . a balance model for the adaxial/abaxial determinants underlying integument morphogenesis was also proposed: in the inner integument, ats and a proposed additional abaxial factor acted in balanced opposition to cna/phb/phv and rev to promote inner integument growth; in the outer integument, the abaxial activities of ino, kan <dig> and kan <dig> acted in balance with rev to control morphogenesis  <cit> . thus, hd-zipiii transcription factors acted in both the outer and inner integuments as adaxial determinants. in our study, thirteen unigenes with differential expression were included in polarity specification of adaxial/abaxial axis. six of them encoding four kinds of protein: iamt <dig> , erecta , hd <dig>  and myb <dig> , were only found to control the development of leaf polarity  <cit> , and seven encoding the four hd-zipiii transcription factors: phb , phv , cna  and rev , had roles in both leaf and integument adaxial/abaxial polarity formation  <cit> . mutation of these genes would cause injured ovule integuments and abortive embryo sac. all of the seven unigenes were down-regulated in s <dig> plants, conforming to the ovule phenotype in s <dig>  this group of genes was possibly the other important factors affecting gynoecium or ovule development in s <dig>  in addition, it has been demonstrated that overexpression of mir <dig> led to the down-regulation of all five hd-zip iii genes, and concomitantly recapitulated the phenotypes of simultaneous loss-of-function mutation of rev, phv and phb <cit> . it was possible that the mir <dig> was overexpressed in gynoecia of s <dig> and caused the integuments damage indirectly, because the four genes were all down-regulated.

the third related pathway was auxin transport and signaling pathway. as the first plant hormone studied, auxin had wide-ranging effects on growth and development throughout the plant, including gynoecium and ovule morphogenesis  <cit> . auxin can be distributed by passive diffusion through the mature phloem or active polar auxin transport  that mediates cell-to-cell movement of auxin through two different types of proteins, efflux and influx carriers  <cit> . transport proteins, best represented by pin-formed <dig>  and p-glycoproteins <dig> , have been shown to coordinately regulate auxin efflux, and auxin <dig>  and its paralogs like-aux <dig>  are the auxin influx carriers  <cit> . in our study,  <dig> unigenes related with auxin transport or signaling pathway showed different expression levels, some encoded the efflux and influx carriers, such as pin <dig> , pin <dig> , abcb <dig>  and lax <dig> , and two pin phosphorylation regulators pid  and pp2a . pin <dig>  the first gene in pin gene family, had a role in basipetal auxin transport in stem as a catalytic auxin efflux carrier  <cit> . pin <dig>  another member of pin gene family, was a component of the lateral auxin transport system regulating tropic growth and essentially involved in mediating differential shoot growth  <cit> . abcb <dig> encoded one of the pgp proteins  that belonged to atp-binding cassette  transporter superfamily and had an important role in stabilizing pin <dig> localization at the plasma membrane microdomains  <cit> . lax <dig>  one of the paralogs of aux <dig>  might function in concentrating auxin in the cytoplasm of cells of l <dig> layer and preventing auxin diffusion in the apoplast, inducing auxin to flow into the neighboring cells  <cit> . pid encoded a ser/thr protein kinase and functioned on pin phosphorylation that caused the preferential location of pin in the apical side. but the phosphatase pp2a acted antagonistically to pid on phosphorylation of pin proteins. here, all of these genes participating in mediation of auxin fluxes directly or indirectly were down-regulated expressed at different levels. alteration of these genes probably disturbed the auxin flux and distribution in the s <dig> gynoecia, which would arrest the normal development of gynoecia and ovules .

the last group of genes was those with important role in gynoecium or ovule development, such as shp <dig>  hec <dig>  spt, srs <dig>  ckrc <dig>  vdd, ago <dig>  pdil2- <dig>  sep <dig>  pi, ap <dig>  eda <dig> and eda <dig>  all of these genes were down-regulated except ago <dig>  pi and eda <dig>  which was generally in accorded with female sterility. among these differently expressed genes between s <dig> and h <dig>  the two mads box genes, shp <dig> and sep <dig> were reported to be ovule identity factors, controlling ovule integuments identity with other genes  <cit> .

interactions between br, auxin and hd-zipiii genes on gynoecium development
up to now, numerous studies have addressed that there are interactions and crosstalks between brassinosteroids  and auxins. it was demonstrated that the iaa genes were induced by brassinolide  via activating the auxin response elements  <cit> . in the growth of arabidopsis hypocotyl, either application of brs or disruption of br synthesis would alter auxin response, presumably by affecting auxin transport  <cit> . it was confirmed that the gene brx acted at the nexus of a feedback loop that mediates threshold brassinosteroid levels to permit optimal auxin action  <cit> . a recent study showed that a crucial gene for br biosynthesis, dwf <dig>  played a novel role in the br-auxin crosstalk  <cit> . the pp2a protein mediating auxin fluxes mentioned above also had a dual role in the shift between inhibition and activation of br signaling  <cit> . besides brs, hd-zipiii genes also had the link with auxin. it has been proposed that ifl1/rev could influence auxin polar transport and cell differentiation and morphology  <cit> . the loss of class iii hd-zip gene activity resulted in a loss of bilateral symmetry during embryogenesis by altering the pin <dig> localization and mediating auxin signal transduction  <cit> . overall, the brassinosteroid , auxin and hd-zipiii genes likely affected the formation of ovule integuments and growth of gynoecia of s <dig> plants, respectively and corporately. it has been proposed that the enhanced seu cyp85a <dig> double mutant phenotypes in ovule and gynoecium maybe result from the combination of brassinosteroid- and auxin-dependent signaling pathways  <cit> . here, a model of br-, auxin- and hd-zipiii genes-dependent pathways and their interactions for gynoecium development in the female sterile plant was proposed . in addition, the degs and related pathways involved in gynoecium development mentioned above were also listed .

CONCLUSIONS
the complete female sterility in brassica napus mediated by one alien chromosome was caused by the lack of formation of inner and outer integuments and the blocked megasporogenesis. among the  <dig> degs detected by rna-seq in the female sterility, a number of important genes and metabolism pathways were involved in the development of gynoecium, ovule, integuments as well as the interactions between pollen and pistil. particularly, the genes for the pathways related with br, auxin and adaxial/abaxial axis specification were most likely responsible for the abortive development of female organs.
