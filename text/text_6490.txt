BACKGROUND
by organizing the genes in a genome into transcriptional regulatory modules , a living cell can coordinate the activities of many genes and carry out complex functions. therefore, identifying trms is useful for understanding cellular responses to internal and external signals. advances in high-throughput tools such as dna microarray  <cit>  and chromatin immunoprecipitation-chip   <cit>  have made the computational reconstruction of trms of a eukaryotic cell possible.

genome-wide gene expression analysis has been used to investigate trms controlling a variety of cellular processes in yeast  <cit> . clustering and motif-discovering algorithms have been applied to gene expression data to find sets of co-regulated genes and have identified plausible binding motifs of their tfs  <cit> . such approaches have also been expanded to incorporate existing knowledge about the genes, such as cellular functions  <cit>  or promoter sequence motifs  <cit> . moreover, some researchers used model-based approaches such as random boolean networks  <cit>  and bayesian networks  <cit>  to infer regulatory network architectures. however, this approach provides only indirect evidence of genetic regulatory interactions and does not identify the relevant tfs.

on the other hand, the chip-chip technique was developed to identify physical interactions between tfs and dna regions. using chip-chip data, simon et al.  <cit>  investigated how the yeast cell-cycle gene-expression program is regulated by each of nine major transcriptional activators. lee et al.  <cit>  constructed a network of tf-gene interactions and harbison et al.  <cit>  constructed an initial map of yeast's transcriptional regulatory code. however, a weakness in the chip-chip technique is that the binding of a tf to a gene does not necessarily imply regulation. a tf may bind to a gene but has no regulatory effect on that gene's expression. even if a tf does regulate a specific gene, the chip-chip data alone does not tell whether the regulation is activation or repression. hence, additional information is required to solve this ambiguity inherent in chip-chip data.

to overcome this problem, several algorithms have been developed to combine gene expression and chip-chip data to infer the regulatory targets of a tf. for instance, nca  <cit>  and ma-network  <cit>  both use multivariate regression analysis and mfa  <cit>  uses modified factor analysis of gene expression data to classify a tf's binding targets inferred from chip-chip data into regulatory and non-regulatory targets. in this paper, we use a different approach to explore the different biological possibilities for the same phenomenon. we develop a method, called temporal relationship identification algorithm , which uses time-lagged correlation analysis between a tf and its binding targets to identify its regulatory targets. our rationale is that a tf has a high time-lagged correlation with its regulatory targets, but has a low time-lagged correlation with its binding but non-regulatory targets. time-lagged correlation analysis has the ability to infer causality and directional relationships between genes  <cit> . it has also been used to reconstruct the reaction network of central carbon metabolism  <cit>  and the gene interaction networks of synechocystis sp  <cit> . therefore, time-lagged correlation analysis has the potential to be used to identify a tf's regulatory targets from its binding targets which may or may not be regulated by the tf.

RESULTS
identification of the plausible regulatory targets of a tf
two previous papers  <cit>  used a statistical error model to assign a p-value to the binding relationship of a tf-gene pair. they found that if p-value ≤  <dig> , the binding relationship of a tf-gene pair is of high confidence and can usually be confirmed by gene-specific pcr. therefore, we include a gene in the set b+ if the tf-gene binding p-value in the chip-chip data is ≤  <dig> , i.e. b+ consists of genes that are significantly bound by a tf. further, a gene in b+ is assigned into b+r+ if it has a temporal relationship with the tf but into b+r- otherwise. a tf-gene pair is said to have a temporal relationship if the gene's expression profile is significantly correlated with the tf's regulatory profile possibly with time lags . our hypothesis is that the genes in b+r+ are more likely to be the regulatory targets of a tf than are the genes in b+r-. tria is developed to classify b+ into b+r+ and b+r-.

only a subset of the binding targets are plausible regulatory targets of a tf
we considered nine cell cycle tfs that have both sizes of b+r+ and b+r- ≥  <dig> . the number of genes in each group  is listed in table  <dig>  on average, 55% of significantly bound genes are identified as the plausible regulatory targets of a tf, similar to the result  of  <cit> , and 64% of the inferred regulatory targets have expression profiles that are positively correlated with the tf's regulatory profile possibly with time lags. moreover, only 16% of the inferred regulatory targets and the tf are co-expressed . that is, 84% of the inferred regulatory targets may not be found if we use the conventional correlation analysis that can only check whether a tf-gene pair are co-expressed or not . the following analyses were performed to validate our method.

enrichment for specific functional categories
b+r+ is shown to be more enriched than b+r- for specific mips functional categories with adjusted p-value <  <dig>   using the cumulative hypergeometric distribution . in most cases , except for rap <dig> and swi <dig>  the number of enriched mips functional categories in b+r+ is larger than that in b+r- . this result suggests that our criterion for distinguishing the plausible from non-plausible regulatory targets of a tf is reliable because co-regulated genes should have a greater probability to be involved in the same functional categories than non-co-regulated genes.

enrichment for cell cycle genes
we compute the proportions of genes of b+r+ and b+r- that belong to the known cell cycle genes identified by spellman et al.  <cit> . we then test whether the enrichment of the known cell cycle genes in b+r+ is statistically higher than that in b+r-. the cumulative hypergeometric distribution is used to assign a p-value for determining the statistical significance . in most cases , except for abf <dig> and ace <dig>  the cell cycle genes are more enriched in b+r+ than in b+r- . this result also suggests that our criterion for distinguishing the plausible from non-plausible regulatory targets of a cell cycle tf is reliable because regulatory targets of a cell cycle tf should be more enriched for the known cell cycle genes than should non-regulatory targets.

taken together, the results mentioned above convincingly demonstrate that tria is a good method for identifying the plausible regulatory targets of a tf from its binding targets.

identifying highly co-expressed genes among the plausible regulatory targets of a tf
it is known that co-regulated genes may not be co-expressed  <cit> . therefore, it is useful to identify highly co-expressed genes among co-regulated genes because these co-regulated and highly co-expressed genes should be more likely to be simultaneously co-activated or co-repressed by the same tf and involve in the same cellular process.

tria has the ability to identify subsets of highly co-expressed genes among the regulatory targets of a tf. first, we use tria to identify the plausible regulatory targets  from the binding targets  of a tf. then, we classify b+r+ into subsets ai and ri, where ai  contains all genes whose expression profiles are positively  correlated with the tf's regulatory profile with a lag of i time points. finally, we test whether the expression coherence of xi is statistically higher than that of b+r+, where xi = ai or ri. the expression coherence of genes in a set g ) is defined as the fraction of gene pairs in g with a correlation in expression level higher than a threshold t  <cit> . the threshold t was determined to be the 95th percentile correlation value of all pairwise correlations between  <dig> randomly chosen genes in the yeast genome. note that  <dig> ≤ ec ≤  <dig>  the cumulative hypergeometric distribution is used to assign a p-value for rejecting the null hypothesis ec = ec, where xi = ai or ri .

performance comparison with existing methods
to identify the regulatory targets of a tf, gao et al.  <cit>  developed ma-network that uses multivariate regression analysis of gene expression data and yu et al.  <cit>  developed a modified factor analysis  approach. we compare the identified regulatory targets of the tfs that are available in our study and at least one of the other two studies. on average, only 53% of our identified regulatory targets are also found by ma-network and only 31% of our identified regulatory targets are also found by mfa. there is little overlap between the above three studies. this is not surprising biologically since the three methods study different biological possibilities for the same phenomenon. however, since the results of the three methods are not highly congruent, a performance comparison of these three methods should be done. since a tf has to bind to its regulatory targets to regulate their expressions, enrichment of the high-confidence tf binding motifs among the identified regulatory targets of a tf can be used as a criterion for performance comparison. the high-confidence tf binding motifs were derived using six motif discovery methods, also including the requirement for conservation across at least three of the four related yeast species  <cit> . let s <dig>  be the set of regulatory targets of a tf that are identified by tria but not by ma-network  and s <dig>  be the set of regulatory targets of a tf that are identified by ma-network  but not by tria. we tested over-representation of the high-confidence tf binding motifs in s <dig> and s <dig> . the cumulative hypergeometric distribution is used to assign a p-value to the motif enrichment . we found that in four of the five  cases the high-confidence tf binding motifs are enriched in s <dig> with p-value <  <dig>  but only two of the five  cases in s <dig> are enriched . similarly, we found that in six of the eight  cases the high-confidence tf binding motifs are enriched in t <dig> with p-value <  <dig>  but none of the eight  cases in t <dig> is enriched . the results show that tria has a better ability to identify the regulatory targets of a tf than do ma-network and mfa.

discussion
many researchers used chip-chip data to study regulatory networks of the yeast  <cit> . most of them  regarded that a gene is regulated by a tf if the gene is bound by the tf with a p-value ≤  <dig>  in the chip-chip data. however, a tf that binds to a gene may have no regulatory effect on that gene. therefore, additional information is required to solve this uncertainty. tria was developed to overcome this problem and was applied to gene expression and chip-chip data to identify the plausible regulatory targets of nine cell cycle tfs. the effectiveness of tria was validated by statistically testing for the enrichment of functional groups and known cell cycle genes.

since co-expressed genes are not necessarily co-regulated and vice versa  <cit> , it is important to develop a method that can identify co-regulated genes that are not co-expressed. tria has the ability to do this task. through identifying a tf's binding targets that have temporal relationships with the tf, we can find the tf's regulatory targets that may not be co-expressed. we can further identify subsets of highly co-expressed genes among the inferred regulatory targets according to the identified time lags and regulatory directions. these co-regulated and highly co-expressed genes should be more likely to be simultaneously co-activated or co-repressed by the tf and can be used as candidates for further experimental studies.

tria has been successfully used by two previous studies to investigate other biological problems. first, tsai et al.  <cit>  developed tfbsfinder, which utilizes several data sources , to identify cell cycle tf binding sites in yeast. tria was used to select reliable target genes of a tf in the first step of their algorithm. the target gene selection is a important step that strongly enhances the performance of tfbsfinder  <cit> . since the performance of tfbsfinder is shown to be better than three well-known tf binding site identification algorithms   <cit> , this confirmed that tria does have ability to identify the plausible regulatory targets of a tf. second, wu et al.  <cit>  developed mofa, which integrates gene expression and chip-chip data, to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory modules  of the yeast cell cycle. tria was used as the first step of mofa to refine the noisy raw chip-chip data and construct a binding score matrix. the quality of the binding score matrix strongly affects the performance of mofa  <cit> . the trms identified by mofa was validated by using existing experimental data, enrichment for genes in the same mips functional category, known dna-binding motifs, etc. in addition, mofa is capable of finding many novel tf-target gene relationships and can determine whether a tf is an activator or/and a repressor  <cit> . since mofa can reconstruct biologically relevant trms of the yeast cell cycle, this also attests to the usefulness of tria.

in this paper, tria is used to identify regulatory targets of cell cycle tfs. for a control, we show that tria can also perform well for cell-cycle irrelevant regulators. in this regard, we apply tria to identify regulatory targets of tfs that are activated by amino acid starved stress. the genome-wide gene expression and chip-chip data under amino acid starved growth condition are download from  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  in most of the cases, b+r+ is more enriched than b+r- for specific mips functional categories with adjusted p-value <  <dig>   using the cumulative hypergeometric distribution. this result suggests that tria performed well for cell-cycle irrelevant tfs.

the development of tria was motivated by two biological observations. first, it is known that tf binding affects gene expression in a nonlinear fashion: below some level it has no effect, and above some level the effect may saturate. this type of behavior can be modeled using a sigmoid function. therefore, we define a tf's regulatory profile as a sigmoid function of its expression profile as in previous studies  <cit> . although this may not be true for tfs that are activated at the post-translational stage  <cit> , it is not a serious problem for many cell cycle tfs whose expression levels significantly varies with times, indicating that they are under transcriptional control  <cit> . second, the regulatory effect of a tf on its target genes may not be simultaneous but has a time lag  <cit> . this makes tria more general than previous studies  <cit>  that regard a gene to be regulated by a tf only when the gene's expression profile are co-expressed with the transcription factor activity  profile. actually, we found that tria performed better than two previous algorithms   <cit> . this may result from the fact that tria is designed for cell cycle tfs and also considers a time-lagged correlation between a cell cycle tf and its regulatory targets.

in this study, we use time-lagged correlation analysis between a tf and its binding targets to identify its regulatory targets. however, in some cases, tfs may interact with each other and together regulate a group of target genes. this issue will be addressed in the future. we will try to define an overall regulatory profile of a tf complex and apply tria to identify target genes that are co-regulated by the same tf complex.

CONCLUSIONS
an algorithm called tria is developed to identify the plausible regulatory targets of a tf from its binding targets. since the binding of a tf to a gene does not necessarily imply regulation, tria is used to solve this ambiguity. we validated the effectiveness of tria by checking the enrichments for functional annotation and known cell cycle genes. moreover, the performance of tria was shown to be better than two published methods . moreover, tria has the ability to identify subsets of highly co-expressed genes among the regulatory targets of a tf. in addition, tria has been successfully applied to identify high-confidence cell cycle tf binding sites  <cit>  and to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory modules of the yeast cell cycle  <cit> . finally, for a control, tria is shown to perform well for cell-cycle irrelevant tfs. in conclusion, tria can find biologically relevant results and should be useful for systems biology study.
