BACKGROUND
poly binding protein  binds to the 3′ poly tail of messenger rna   <cit> . this protein is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes and has expanded in plants as a multigene family  <cit> . pabps are involved in most aspects of mrna biology . pabp domain structure consists of an amino-terminal domain that includes four distinct rna recognition motifs , followed by a linker region and a carboxy-terminal domain known as mlle . the mlle domain binds proteins that contain a poly-binding protein interacting motif  <dig>  .

pabp is viewed as a translation initiation factor that stimulates translation promoting mrna circularization  <cit> . it bridges between the poly and the 5′ cap structure, mediated by the interaction with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4g and 4e  complex . pabp function can also be modulated within assemblies by the interaction with other factors. two human proteins, pabp-interacting protein  <dig>  and pabp-interacting protein  <dig> , enhance or suppress translation, respectively, by binding to pabp. both paip proteins bind to pabp using two separate motifs; one motif protein corresponds to an acidic segment that binds to the rrm and the other to pam <dig>  which binds to mlle  <cit> . the mlle domains of the pabps also mediate the interactions with several other proteins. some of these proteins are involved with rna metabolism, such as ataxin- <dig>  eif4b, erf <dig>  gw <dig>  hezl, and larp <dig>  other proteins, which may have a role in translation regulation, are mkrn <dig> and tob1/ <dig>  which encode an e <dig> ubiquitin-ligase and an anti-proliferative protein that suppresses cell growth, respectively  <cit> . the mlle and pam <dig> domains are conserved in the plant kingdom, so pabp-interacting proteins have also been described in plants. proteins that interact with mlles have been identified and designated as cids   <cit> . thirteen arabidopsis thaliana cids containing distinct domains have been grouped into four classes . this diversity and abundance of pabp interactors suggests that cids may affect translational control in plants  <cit> .

little is known about the modulation of pabp assemblies in plants. we previously performed a genome-wide survey of group b cids  across eukaryotic organisms to further understand the evolution and divergence of cids. class b includes four a. thaliana genes , which are orthologs of the mammalian ataxin- <dig> and yeast pbp <dig> genes  <cit> . they encode evolutionarily conserved proteins across eukaryotes. these proteins have been implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type  <dig>  and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  in humans, two progressive neurodegenerative diseases. they contain a like rna splicing domain sm <dig> and sm <dig> , which potentially binds rna, and a like-sm-associated domain  that includes a clathrin-mediated trans-golgi signal . lsmad also mediates the interaction with the dead/h-box rna helicase ddx <dig>  cid <dig> and cid <dig> are derivatives that lack lsmad, which suggests that new subcellular distributions and functional properties have developed on these variants. notably, in both cid <dig> and cid <dig> pam <dig> is composed of two tandem reiterations that may provide them with alternative functional features .fig.  <dig> domain structure of the four classes of cid proteins. classes are denoted by letters , and subclasses by letters and a subsequent number . representing a. thaliana cid orthologs defining each subclass or the g. max ortholog in subclass a <dig> are indicated. the schematic representation of relevant domains proposed for each class is depicted. the sequence logo for the pam <dig> domain generated on each class are aligned together and enclosed by a rectangle; highly conserved residues are denoted at the top by an asterisk. pae <dig>  pam <dig> associated element  <dig>  <cit> ; acidic, rich in acidic amino acids  <cit> ; iqqrp, a highly conserved signature  <cit> ; gmerd15-tfd, transcription factor domain predicted in g. max gmerd <dig>   <cit> ; lsm, like rna splicing domain sm <dig> and sm <dig>  lsmad, lsm associated domain  <cit> ; cue, coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to er degradation domain  <cit> ; duf <dig>  domain of unknown function; smr, small muts-related domain  <cit> ; rrm, rna recognition motif  <cit> 



the objective of the current study was to continue the analysis by surveying the other three groups of cids across plant species. we found that similar to group b, newly evolved functions might have diverged in two additional groups after loosing defined domains. this diversification may be neutral or might represent novel responses to a variety of environmental changes. the presence of these novel gene functions suggests that some cids might participate to increase complexity within the pabps assemblies providing new and refined ways to modulate translation in plants.

methods
cid identification and retrieval
the sequences used in this work were retrieved from  <dig> viridiplantae genomes deposited in the phytozome  <dig>  database  and from the previous version, phytozome  <dig> . the genomes included  <dig> basal plant species ,  <dig> basal angiosperm,  <dig> monocots, and  <dig> eudicot plants . seven truncated sequences were readily assembled into cid-like genes using visual inspection , neighbor-joining , and maximum-parsimony  phylogenetic trees were generated using mega  <dig> software  <cit> ;  <dig> bootstrap replicates were obtained in the nj and mp analysis. the jones-taylor-thornton model was used with  <dig> gamma categories and the posterior probabilities support values for each node were computed by resampling  <dig> times during the ml estimation. statistical significance in percentages >50 % for the nj and maximum-parsimony , and posterior probabilities < <dig>  for the maximum-likelihood  are indicated on the nodes. phylogenetic trees were based on complete protein sequences or on distinct domains that were generally included in a sequence logo. for example, the  <dig> amino acid segment comprising pae <dig> , the  <dig> amino acid segment comprising the cue domain , and the  <dig> amino acid segment comprising both rrm domains were used to generate the trees in classes a, c, and d, respectively. the trees were displayed and edited by itol  software  <cit> .

generation of sequence logos
as previously detected in class b, the apparent occurrence of gene variants within classes of cids is a readily noticeable characteristic. we used meme software  to search for cid classes a, c, and d and discover motifs that might support cid classification and have functional significance. conserved motifs for each protein class were obtained using multiple em for motif elicitation  version  <dig> . <dig>   <cit> . the parameter values of  <dig> or  <dig> per sequence, and  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids as minimum and maximum sizes of motifs, respectively, were used. the e-value cutoff was < e- <dig>  the sequences that had the characteristics for cid class definition or that contained known domains  are presented in additional file  <dig> 

RESULTS
identification of cids across embryophyte species
the domain architectures for the four classes of cid proteins are presented in fig.  <dig>  next to the sequence logos for the pam <dig> motif from each class or subclass. each class has a distinct domain architecture, which includes a conserved pam <dig>  we previously surveyed for ataxin- <dig> genes  across  <dig> eukaryotic species, including plants, animals, and fungi. two class b cid subclasses were retrieved. one subclass corresponded to a novel class that does not encode the lsmad domain . ataxin- <dig> genes  are the only cids that are evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes  <cit> . cid orthologs of classes a, c, and d were previously only identified in land plants . hence, we only sampled the embryophyte genes of these three classes of cids. subclasses were considered to be present if a particular domain was determined to set apart a set of peptides from several distinct lineages.fig.  <dig> number of retrieved viridiplantae cid proteins. the phylogenetic relationship between  <dig> viridiplantae genomes is displayed at the right. relationships were adapted from the national center of biotechnology information  taxonomy server   <cit> . cid paralogs are indicated by colored squares. dark and light colors represent cid subclasses  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . class b sequences are from a previous work, except for the orthologs from amborella trichopoda, spirodela polyrhiza, panicum halli, malus domestica, and arabidopsis halleri, which are also listed in additional file 1




genes from all classes were retrieved from all the species analyzed, which indicated that their functions have been preserved across land plants. one or two genes were identified in the basal species, the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii and the moss physcomitrella patens, and in the earliest diverging angiosperm, amborella trichopoda. conversely, the numbers of genes have increased in some species that have experienced additional or recent genome duplications  .

diversity of transcription factor domains among class a cids
class a genes consist of a. thaliana cid <dig> and cid <dig>  cid <dig> corresponds to the early responsive to dehydration  <dig>  gene, which was formerly isolated as cdna rapidly induced in response to dehydration  <cit> . in a. thaliana, cid1/erd <dig> is a component of the stress response, particularly as a negative regulator in the phytohormone abscisic acid  signaling response. ectopic expression of cid1/erd <dig> reduces aba sensitivity, and reduction in cid1/erd <dig> levels results in aba hypersensitivity  <cit> . functional diversification has been assumed for a soybean cid1/erd <dig> homolog, gmerd <dig>  this homolog links an osmotic stress-induced cell death signal to endoplasmic reticulum stress by functioning as a transcription factor that binds to the n-rich protein -b promoter. conversely, the a. thaliana cid1/erd <dig> homolog does not function as a transcriptional activator at the nrp-b promoter  <cit> . analysis of cid1/erd <dig> proteins derived mostly from est clones revealed conserved domain architecture. cids from this class are small proteins ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues in length containing a conserved motif, pam <dig> associated element  <dig> , located adjacent to pam <dig>  an acidic region, and the highly conserved signature iqqrp at the carboxy-terminus   <cit> .

in class a, two subclasses were considered to locate apart putative orthologs of the glycine max gmerd <dig> : subclasses cid1/cid <dig> and gmerd15-tdf . glyma02g <dig> was previously described in g. max as a transcription factor to encode a specific transcription activation domain not present in a. thaliana  <cit> . we assigned the designation gmerd15-tfd to this domain . this sequence was identified as a search sequence for logos. indeed, neither the brassicaceae nor the two basal species encode this class of ortholog. accordingly, subclass  <dig> contains a. thaliana cid1/erd <dig>  cid <dig> and members that were not identified as putative orthologs of gmerd <dig> 

meme searches were performed in a set of  <dig> cid a protein sequences that varied between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids residues in length. four sequence logos were common to all or almost all of the polypeptides. logo #a <dig> corresponded to pam <dig>  logo #a <dig> defined the previously reported pae <dig> sequence adjacent to pam <dig>  these two logos were present in all of the predicted polypeptides. logos #a <dig> and logo #a <dig> mapped to the carboxy-terminal region and were found in  <dig> and 80 % in the predicted polypeptides, respectively. logo #a <dig> included the previously described signature iqqrp . two subclasses, cid a <dig> and cid a <dig>  were considered based on the sequence logos mapped between pae <dig> and logo #a <dig>  this region was previously described as acidic. logo #a <dig> was present in all cid a <dig> proteins, except for the two basal species p. patens and s. moellendorffii, and in the brassicaceae cid <dig> orthologs . specific sequence logos for eudicot and monocot species also mapped to this region . for the other class, logo #a <dig> and logo #a <dig> mapped to almost all proteins . logo #a <dig> contained the transcriptional activation domain previously described as present in the soybean ortholog, gmerd <dig>  . logo #a <dig> was not found in either of the two basal species, p. patens or s. moellendorffii, nor in the six brassicaceae species tested . it was present in eudicot and monocot species, including the early lineage a. trichopoda and s. polyrhiza.fig.  <dig> comparison of the domain architectures of class cid a <dig> and class cid a <dig> proteins. domain architecture is represented, including pam <dig>  logo #a <dig> , logo #a <dig>  and logo #a <dig> that were common to class a cids. the primary sequence for each logo is shown. logo #a <dig>  logo #a <dig>  and logo #a <dig> were specific for class a <dig>  logo #a <dig> and logo #a <dig>  were specific for class a <dig>  the alignments of the cid a <dig> and cid a <dig> proteins are presented in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  respectively



construction of the phylogenetic distribution of class a cids was performed using standard approaches. we built phylogenies containing  <dig> cid a sequences using the nj, mp, and ml methods. trees based on complete polypeptide sequences or on the  <dig> amino acids segment comprising pae <dig>  were generated; the nj trees are shown in fig.  <dig> and in additional file  <dig>  and the mp and ml trees in additional file 6). the phylogenetic trees clustered the logo #a <dig> -containing sequences in both types of trees. minor inconsistencies of sequence location among the two cid a subclasses were detected when comparing the three methods. the sequence bdi|brachypodium distachyon bradi1g <dig>  was misplaced in both trees generated by the ml method and in the tree based on the pae <dig> logo by the mp method. in addition, one of the spirodela polyrhiza sequences was misplaced in the tree based on complete sequences and generated by the mp methods . the gmerd15-tfd-containing clade contained members for every species analyzed , except the six brassicaceae, and the two basal, species . accordingly, the orthologs of this g. max paralog  were absent in the six species of brassicaceae tested . a. thaliana cid <dig> and cid <dig> grouped in separate clades, suggesting that they belong in two distinct lineages .fig.  <dig> phylogeny of cid a proteins. the pae <dig> sequence logo  and the complete polypeptide sequence were used to obtain the trees. the topology was generated using the neighbor-joining  method. cid a <dig> class is point out in a gray circular line. branch for groups of organisms were named with the subclass code followed by a letter. branch color codes: eudicots, dark green; monocots, light green; brassicaceae , blue; the basals selaginella moellendorffii and physcomitrella patens , red; amborella trichopoda , purple; spirodela polyrhiza , mustard yellow. the positions of the two a. thaliana paralogs, cid <dig>  and cid <dig> are shown.  are in dissimilar places in both trees: aco|aquilegia coerulea aquca  <dig>  <dig> , ccl|citrus clementina ciclev10032949m, csi|citrus sinensis orange <dig> g031370m. species and gene names are as presented in the rectangular phylogeny in additional file  <dig>  trees generated using mp and ml are displayed in additional file 6




loss of domains after duplication on maintained class c cids in eudicots
class c consists of three genes , which encode a variant of the coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to er degradation  domain that binds ubiquitin in a. thaliana  <cit> . cid <dig> and cid <dig> are highly related proteins. cid <dig> also carries a small muts-related  domain and the domain of unknown function duf <dig> . mutss are found in enzymes involved in mismatch repair of dna bases, and the smr domain is often present in bacterial and eukaryotic proteomes  <cit> . cid <dig> corresponds to the increased polyploidy level in darkness 1-1d  gene. the ipd1-1d mutant was identified as an activation tagging line that displays increased polyploidy in dark-grown hypocotyl cells. cid5/ipd <dig> may be a component of the machinery that controls endoreplication cell cycles  <cit> .

orthologs from subclass c <dig> were retrieved from all species, except carica papaya and medicado truncatula. they were found mostly as one or two copies, but four were found in g. max. conversely, subclass c <dig> that includes orthologs of cid5/cid <dig> were only present in eudicots and ranged from one to five copies . the two copies retrieved from spirodela polyrhiza are likely to be partial or rearranged sequences; they both clustered within subclass c <dig> in a phylogenetic tree .

meme searches were performed for a set of  <dig> class c protein sequences. the two class c cid subclasses  were readily distinguished, which ranged between  <dig> and  <dig>  and between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids residues in length, respectively. three logo sequences were associated with both classes, logo #c <dig>  which contained the cue domain, and logo #c <dig> pam <dig> and logo #c <dig> . these results suggested that the classes are sequence related and that they may have a common origin. logo #c <dig> is an  <dig> residue sequence of unknown function that is present in all or almost all class c proteins . cid5/ipd <dig> was previously described as a protein that encodes a cue domain variant  <cit> . the cue is a domain of about  <dig> amino acids that encode conserved motifs, which can interact with ubiquitin. an invariant proline residue and a di-leucine motif are highly conserved in the cue domain   <cit> . cid5/ipd <dig> encoded a serine to the invariant proline. the results for the alignment of the cue domain of class c cids indicated that most brassicaceae of the c <dig> subclass and five monocots of the c <dig> subclass lack the p residue . the leucine-leucine  motif that can prevail in plants as methionine-leucine  varied in only  <dig> of the  <dig> c <dig> subclass sequences . distinct logo sequences were also produced for each subclass. they included two logos defined as previously identified domains duf <dig> and smr in subclass c <dig> ; these two logos were present in all of the class c <dig> sequences.fig.  <dig> comparison of the domain architectures of class cid c <dig> and class cid c <dig> proteins. the locations of previously identified domains are indicated: pam <dig>  cue, duf <dig>  smr. relevant sequence logos are represented by a number. logos containing duf <dig>  smr, and cue and logo #c <dig> are displayed; the catalog of sequence logos is presented in additional file 2

the phylogenetic distribution of  <dig> class c cids was constructed using complete polypeptide sequences or the  <dig> amino acid segment comprising the cue domain ; trees were generated by the three methods nj, ml and mp. with the nj tree, except for c. papaya and m. truncatula, subclass c <dig> sequences clustered together on both trees ; one major clade containing members of all species and in one minor clade four monocot sequences . a similar clustering was observed when the ml and mp methods were used . in every tree, all of the monocot sequences were included in subclass c <dig> . the two s. polyrhiza proteins clustered in this class even though they are probably unfinished sequences . the result that the two basal  and the monocot species were only present in subclass c <dig>  suggested that subclass c <dig> arose from lack of retention of specific domains in eudicots, after gene duplication  .fig.  <dig> phylogeny of cid c proteins. the cue sequence logo  and the complete polypeptide sequence were used to obtain the trees; they were generated by the nj method. cid c <dig> class is shadowed in gray. the color codes on the branches for groups of organisms are the same as in fig.  <dig>  branch were named with the subclass code followed by a letter. the positions of the three a. thaliana paralogs, cid <dig>  cid <dig> and cid <dig> are shown. the rectangular phylogeny is shown in additional file  <dig>  trees generated using mp and ml are displayed in additional file 10




class d cids consists of highly conserved rna-binding proteins
class d includes six putative rna-binding proteins   that contain two rna recognition motifs . rbps have central functions in rna metabolism  <cit> . rrm is one of the various domains known to bind rna. similar to other eukaryotic organisms, genes in a. thaliana encode more than  <dig> rbps; many of these are plant-specific  <cit> . except for some information regarding cid <dig>  the functions of this group of cids are unknown. cid <dig> corresponds to rbp <dig>  which may have a role in early embryogenesis and organ growth  <cit> .

class d orthologs, which encode two consecutive rrm domains, were identified in all species. the numbers varied from  <dig> in the basal species, p. patens and s. moellendorffii, to  <dig> in g. raimondii and  <dig> in b. rapa. putative orthologs from this class were identified in  <dig> algae species. these orthologs were not included in our analysis because inspection of the sequences indicated that the pam <dig> motif was not present . it is possible that pam <dig> was acquired in land plants; this hypothesis was not further investigated.

meme searches were performed for a set of  <dig> class d protein sequences between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids residues in length. seven sequence logos were found to extend the two rrm domains . the rrm is a widespread rna-binding domain that includes two ribonucleoprotein motifs, rnp <dig> and rnp <dig>  <cit> . these two sequences are 6– <dig> amino acid residues motifs located to the middle, and close to the amino-terminal region, of the domain. the location and the primary sequence were conserved in almost all class d cid members , which suggested that binding specificity is highly related in all members of the class. sequence logos common to almost all sequences were mapped adjacent to the rrm <dig>  and the pam <dig>  domains. the logo adjacent to the rrm <dig> was rich in arginine residues and logo #d <dig> in was rich in charged amino acid residues . these results suggested that these logos may have specific functions. we did not find evidence of major domain changes among members of class d that could be predicted using logo analysis. although specific sequence logos was generated for monocots and eudicots, their functional relevance remains unclear. both rrm domains were maintained. this result suggests that these domains are involved in a highly conserved and specific function.fig.  <dig> a broad view of the domain architecture of cid d proteins. the location of the two rrm domains is indicated below the sequence logos that include them. the logos of the rnp- <dig> and rnp- <dig> motifs for each rrm are shown. relevant sequence logos that are conserved in most of the sequences, logo #d <dig> logo #d <dig>  and logo #d <dig> are displayed; the catalog of sequence logos is displayed in additional file 2




construction of a phylogenetic distribution containing  <dig> cid d sequences was performed using the  <dig> amino acid segment comprising both rrm domains or the complete polypeptide sequences. since subclasses were not inferred from the logo analysis of the pcid d sequences, we only constructed a tree by the nj method . the tree based on complete sequences had a major clade that contained all members of the two basal species, almost all monocots, and the members of most of the eudicot species analyzed. this clade contained three of the a. thaliana paralogs, cid <dig>  cid <dig>  and cid <dig>  consistencies were detected when the corresponding clade in the tree based on rrms were compared. for instance, cid <dig> and cid <dig> were grouped in the same clade, suggesting that this is the most recent duplication of cid c genes. likewise, cid <dig> grouped with the basal species in both trees indicating that it may be the earlier gene copy of this class .fig.  <dig> phylogeny of cid d proteins. the sequence encompassing rrm <dig> and rrm <dig> motifs and the complete polypeptide sequence were used to obtain the trees by the nj method. the positions of the six a. thaliana paralogs, cid <dig>  cid <dig>  cid <dig>  cid <dig>  cid <dig>  and cid <dig> are shown. the color codes on the branches for groups of organisms are the same as in fig.  <dig>  the rectangular phylogeny is shown in additional file 11




discussion
diversification in regulatory programs is an indication of the ability of an organism to respond to multiple developmental and environmental cues. the evolution of specialized regulatory mechanisms endows organisms with an exceptional assortment of regulatory programs that fine-tune gene regulation at several levels . as sessile organisms, plants have evolved elaborate and redundant regulatory mechanisms that fine-tune growth and development in response to the environment  <cit> . the posttranscriptional level of gene expression is an important step in regulation. precise interaction among regulators within assemblies can control the outcomes of specific transcripts . pabp is a conserved eukaryotic protein that interacts with the poly tail of messenger rnas having roles in mrna stability and translation control  <cit> . one to a few pabps genes are found in fungi and animals, but a significant expansion in the gene number is evident throughout plant evolutionary history  <cit> . in this work, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of three classes of cids, the interaction partners of the mlle domain of pabps  <cit> . we found that variants that arose during evolution occurred frequently among cid classes. based on the fact that cids may participate in pabps assemblies, cid subclasses may result in paralog interference  <cit> . although this interference is predictably unfavorable, it is often bypassed or resolved during evolution. the fact that cids subclasses are maintained since early lineages suggests their association within pabp assemblies. these results reinforce the idea that assorted control mechanisms evolved in plants to allow them to adjust to a changing environment. yet, at this point, with the absence of proper experimental evidence we ought also to consider these variants to be selectively neutral, exerting independent functions. one exception, class d, consists of highly conserved rna-binding proteins. in our analysis of this class, we did not detect any sequence variations that might suggest divergence. more than one copy of cid d proteins was present in the analyzed plants. this result suggested that they are redundant proteins that may have very similar roles.

our previous findings for class b cids suggested that functional specialization is present in ataxin- <dig> orthologs. a subclass was found that might have novel subcellular localization and functional properties; it lacks the lsmad domain that includes a clathrin-mediated trans-golgi signal and participates in the recruitment of the helicase ddx <dig>  <cit> . similarly, cid class a and c variants were also identified. functional diversity has been predicted for cid a. cid1/erd <dig> functions in diverse stress pathways. the g. max ortholog, gmerd <dig>  is a transcription factor that binds to the nrp-b promoter and functions as an early component that links endoplasmic reticulum stress to an osmotic stress-induced cell death signal  <cit> . the results of a a transactivation experiment in yeast revealed that cid1/erd <dig> and gmerd <dig> work in different ways. gmerd <dig> displays transactivation activity, but cid1/erd <dig> does not; cid1/erd <dig> also does not bind to the nrp-b promoter in yeast  <cit> . these results suggest that functional divergence of these two orthologs has occurred. whether cid1/erd <dig> is a transcription factor needs to be evaluated. the results of our a previous assay suggested that cid1/erd <dig> encodes an activation domain that is functional in yeast  <cit> . it is possible that cid a proteins are transcription factors consisting of paralogs that diverged during evolution.

the results of the domain architecture and the phylogenetic distribution analyses supported the hypothesis that functional divergence occurred among class cid a genes. a specific logo generated on putative gmerd <dig> orthologs  of all species except the basal species, p. patens and s. moellendorffii, and the six brassicaceae that were analyzed. the result that sequence logos did not generate in the two basal species indicates that specific domains were acquired throughout evolution. moreover, orthologs containing logo #a <dig> clustered in both phylogenetic trees based on complete sequences or in the pae <dig> logo. these clusters did not include any of the brassicaceae species analyzed . since p. patens and s. moellendorffii sequences are basal to the gmerd <dig> orthologs and the brassicaceae species are not the same lineage, it is possible that this specific ortholog was lost early in the brassicaceae lineage.

variants of class c cids were readily identified. class c <dig> variants are present in both monocot and eudicot species. class b variants are present only in eudicots. class c <dig> encodes larger proteins than class c <dig> and contains domains that are not present in c <dig> . class c <dig> likely underwent rearrangements, which included deletions, early during the split between monocots and eudicots. at least two regions are common to both classes, cue and logo #c <dig>  cue is an evolutionarily conserved domain that binds directly to monoubiquitin and participates in ubiquitination  <cit> . cid5/ipd <dig>  is involved in a light-dependent endoreduplication pathway, controlling the endocycle during hypocotyl elongation. cid5/ipd <dig> is described as a protein containing a cue domain variant because a highly conserved amino acid residue within the cue domain involved in ubiquitin binding is missing; a proline residue has been replaced by a serine. the cue domain is likely diverging into distinct lineages  <cit> . our results suggested that this divergence specifically occurred in the class c <dig> proteins, from the six brassicaceae examined . each of these brassicaceae members have at least two copies of class c <dig> genes. one of the copies still encodes the highly conserved proline residue only in a. thaliana and t. halophila. similarly, major sequence variation is present in four monocot sequences from class c <dig>  which is consistent with their grouping in a separate branch in the phylogenetic tree . because this proline residue is essential for monoubiquitin binding, whether the cue domain in these proteins remains as a component of the ubiquitination machinery remains to be determined. the function of the smr domain encoded in class c <dig> that is a widespread in eukaryotes continues to be an enigma  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
functional analysis of cid proteins is in its infancy in plants. because there is obvious diversification among various classes of cids, the functional analysis will be helpful to determine whether diversification is neutral or whether it is important for plant adaptation to the environment, or for the acquisition of specific traits during evolution. association of cids within pabps assemblies could be envisioned based on the presence of the pam <dig> domain and on the fact that pabps interact with many other proteins involved in the regulation of protein synthesis or mrna metabolism. pabps assemblies are basic to every facet of the biology of a plant, so cids are likely to have important roles in the regulation of growth, development, and environmental responses. since the loss of domains often results in competitive interference between duplicates  <cit> , functional analysis will also be imperative to establish the hook up of cid subclasses to the assemblies.
