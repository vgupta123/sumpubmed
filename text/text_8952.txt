BACKGROUND
the development of flower organs into fleshy fruits provides both efficient protection and dispersion of seeds. fleshy fruits develop from swollen ovaries or other flower parts  <cit> , with the structure laid down before or soon after flowering pollination and fertilisation  <cit> . following fertilisation there is a period of rapid growth, facilitated initially by cell division that determines fruit shape, sink strength and size. cell division may be completed 7- <dig> days after anthesis in tomato or extend up to  <dig> days after anthesis in orange  <cit> . subsequent fruit growth is due to the expansion of cells modulated by seed development and its effect on fruit sink strength  <cit> . towards the end of fruit growth, embryos mature and the fruit ripens, often exhibiting rapid changes in hormone concentrations, respiration, cell wall integrity, colour, aroma and flavour compounds  <cit> . these desirable characteristics have led to a long history of selection, commercial development and understanding of fruit crops like apple, grape, tomato, citrus and stone fruit. many of these crops bear fruit with little resemblance to their wild relatives because of this long period of domestication. in contrast, all cultivated kiwifruit, including commercially important cultivars 'hayward'  c.f. liang et a.r. ferguson), and 'hort16a'  are only one or two generations removed from their wild relatives  <cit> .

actinidia species  share a number of common characters; they are all dioecious, with the ovary of the female flower formed by the fusion of many carpels with a whorl of free, radiating styles. the fruit is a berry containing many seeds in a juicy flesh  <cit> . early research focused on cultivars within the hexaploid, green-fleshed, a. deliciosa kiwifruit  <cit> . however, because of its high ploidy number, molecular studies on this fruit are challenging and researchers are selecting the diploid genotypes of a. chinensis to understand the molecular processes of this genus. there is now a comprehensive genetic map of the  <dig> chromosomes of a. chinensis  <cit> , a considerable number of ests  <cit> , and it is readily transformable  <cit> . finally, a. chinensis is currently the focus of an on-going genome sequencing programme . studies of fruit development in a. chinensis 'hort16a' have focused on some aspects of fruit growth and colour development  <cit> , while seasonal changes in fruit carbohydrate concentrations have been described for other a. chinensis genotypes  <cit> . one of the unusual features of actinidia species is in their ripening behaviour, although classified as a climacteric fruit  <cit>  the majority of ripening occurs before autocatalytic ethylene is produced  <cit> .

the researchers of many plant species have benefitted from standardised descriptors of development, as this allows research studies to be compared under different environments or management systems to assess the effect of mutagenesis or specific transgenes. the most commonly used method is the biologische bundesantalt, bundessortenamt und chemische industrie  scale, which describes phenological changes in plant growth using a numeric scale with two decimal digits, the first to represent the principal stages  and second to represent secondary growth stages   <cit> . bbch scales for full plant growth are now available for many plants including arabidopsis thaliana   <cit> , cereals  <cit> , vegetable crops  <cit> , pome and stone fruits  <cit> , grapevine  <cit> , and citrus  <cit> . while the bbch scale has been used to describe the development of a. deliciosa 'hayward'  <cit> , that study was not focused on fruit development and there was little detail of the physiological processes at each developmental step.

here we present a detailed study of fruit development from anthesis through to fruit senescence for a. chinensis 'hort16a'  <cit> . aspects of development studied include fruit growth and ripening , carbohydrate and acid accumulation, ethylene metabolism and gene expression. from this study, we propose a systematic model based on the bbch system for describing the physiological development of the fruit that can be used as anchor points for subsequent kiwifruit development research.

RESULTS
a bbch scale for a. chinensis 'hort16a' fruit development
a detailed study of a. chinensis 'hort16a' during fruit development over three growing seasons  was conducted from anthesis  until fruit were senescing , and aligned to the bbch scale . the principal stages of fruit growth that follow the fully opened flower , are fruit set  and mature fruit . while many bbch scales stop at stage  <dig> when the fruit is "eating ripe", for reasons given below, an additional principal fruit development stage has been added - fruit senescence . this is consistent with the whole-plant bbch scale, which allocates stage  <dig> and above for senescence, and stage  <dig> has been occasionally used for over-ripe fruit  <cit> .

in 'hort16a' fruit development, clear invariant descriptions for each of these principal growth stages are as follows:

principal stage  <dig> fruit set, petals abscised from the flowers and fruit growth starts

principal stage  <dig> mature fruit, seed within the fruit are over 95% black

principal stage  <dig> beginning of senescence, fruit start to produce autocatalytic ethylene.

in season  <dig>  these principal stages were attained at  <dig> daa,  <dig> daa and  <dig> daa respectively .

for secondary growth stages within the bbch scale, stages between  <dig> to  <dig> are described as a percentage of fruit growth, with stage  <dig> having 10% of final fruit weight, to stage  <dig> having 90% of final fruit weight. the pattern of fresh weight increase of 'hort16a' season  <dig> fruit was biphasic, following a sigmoidal growth curve . after fertilisation, fruit growth increased exponentially, with fruit reaching stage  <dig>  at  <dig> daa, and stage  <dig>  at approximately  <dig> daa. following stage  <dig>  the fruit entered a second, slower phase of growth, with stage  <dig>  reached at  <dig> daa. further incremental increases in fruit weight were measured until stage  <dig> , after the seed had turned fully black and the flesh colour had changed. thereafter fruit weight remained constant until stage  <dig> , when it decreased slightly as the fruit senesced . at stage  <dig> , fruit growth had slowed considerably, and the seed had begun to change colour, firstly from white to brown, then finally to black . over 95% of seed had turned black at stage  <dig> .

a similar sigmoidal pattern of growth was observed for fruit in season  <dig> . however, season  <dig> had an unusually hot dry period, which dramatically reduced fruit growth from stages  <dig>  to  <dig> . this slow growth was followed by a period of faster compensatory growth until approximately stage  <dig>  . this shows that unusual environmental conditions can change growth patterns, pushing growth beyond the point where seed are fully black. in these instances, the invariant developmental descriptor, seed greater than 95% black - stage  <dig>  should be used.

for secondary stages between stages  <dig> to  <dig>  the bbch scale progresses from unripe fruit through to the start of fruit senescence. in many fruit species, change in flesh colour finishes at stage  <dig>  at which point softening starts , and the fruit softens to 'eating ripe' at stage  <dig>  eating ripe is a sensory descriptor that depends entirely on the consumer and therefore can vary considerably depending on personal taste. for a more reliable stage descriptor for 'hort16a' fruit, a key point in development is the production of autocatalytic ethylene. this occurs at the end of fruit ripening and the beginning of fruit senescence . autocatalytic ethylene production is a well defined and a readily measurable physiological event and has been assigned stage  <dig> 

in 'hort16a', the outer pericarp of immature fruit  has a green colour with a hue angle of approximately 115°. the colour starts to change at stage  <dig> , and progresses to a yellow colour  by stage  <dig>  . at this time, the fruit is still firm . during stages 80- <dig>  there is a significant increase in soluble sugars in the fruit; the inflection point of sugar increase is assigned stage  <dig> . the faster rate of sugar accumulation continues until the fruit is at stage  <dig>  .

in season  <dig>  fruit flesh firmness measurements were started as soon as the fruit were large enough to assess stage  <dig> . between stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> , the fruit softened gradually from >  <dig> n to ~ <dig> n . following this point, and consistent with season  <dig>  the fruit underwent a typical kiwifruit softening pattern as found in 'hayward' fruit. this softening pattern has been described as having four phases of softening  <cit> . phase i is the initial drop in firmness starting at stage  <dig> , phase ii is the rapid drop in firmness , and phase iii is the slow loss of firmness to ~ <dig> n or less . when the fruit produce autocatalytic ethylene, the cells produce aroma volatiles  <cit> , and a further drop in firmness is observed , with fruit senescence starting - stage  <dig>  . stage  <dig> represents over-ripe senescent fruit, when the fruit are less than  <dig> n . in some less favourable growing conditions, the clear progression of secondary stages between stages  <dig> and  <dig>  may not be observed, with flesh colour change occurring as late as stage  <dig> . in these instances, the more reliable markers for stage  <dig>  and stage  <dig>  should be used .

change in fruit morphology over development
'hort16a' fruit develop from a multicarpellate ovary, with each carpel containing a number of ovules. the fruit has four distinct tissue types: a central core, an inner pericarp  containing locules and seed, a dense outer pericarp , and the skin . at anthesis , the ovules are attached to the core, which is surrounded by pericarp tissue that is also attached to the core by filaments a few cells thick . at this point, the skin is covered with a thick hair . by stage  <dig>  the op tissue has expanded to three times its original width in the flower, while the locular cavities, which develop into the ip, have not expanded at this stage . by stage  <dig>  the developing ip has expanded rapidly surrounding the seed . by stage  <dig>  the ip makes up approximately 40% of the fruit cross sectional area of the fruit, after which the ip continues to expand more rapidly than the op throughout the rest of fruit growth. as the fruit ripens, the inner pericarp zone extended towards the op, resulting in the op being a band of tissue only a few millimetres deep adjacent to the skin, once the fruit reaches stage  <dig> .

carbon accumulation during growth
while the fresh weight accumulation of 'hort16a' fruit shows a sigmoidal growth pattern with slowing growth after stage  <dig>  the dry weight of fruit increases linearly between stage  <dig>  and stage  <dig>  . after this point, the fruit continues to increase in dry weight, reaching a maximum dry weight at stage  <dig> , considerably later than the fresh weight maximum observed at stage  <dig>  . this difference suggests a complex relationship between carbon and water accumulation during development which may be visualised by comparing fresh and dry weight of fruit as dry matter percentages . the dry matter content of the fruit is high at fruit set , and then rapidly drops during the first period of rapid growth, reaching a minimum at  <dig> daa. this is when the fruit has reached 30% of the final fresh weight - stage  <dig> . the dry matter then increases more rapidly than the fresh weight, until stage  <dig>  at which point no further increase in dry matter is observed .

from stage  <dig> onwards, starch begins to accumulate in the fruit until a starch maximum at  <dig> daa  . thereafter, starch is rapidly broken down and metabolised to similar concentrations of sucrose, glucose and fructose . the amount of soluble sugars in 'hort16a' fruit continues to increase until the fruit reaches eating ripeness. when the sugar content in each tissue was assessed, the op and ip both had similar composition until the fruit began to ripen. however, during ripening the starch was more rapidly converted into sugars in the op than in the ip . interestingly, the inflection point of soluble sugar increase occurred before any marked decrease in starch was observed .

during the early stage of rapid fruit growth ) accumulation of acids, particularly quinic acid was observed . this increase has been previously reported in other actinidia species  <cit>  and shown to be part of the osmotic potential in the fruit, aiding fruit growth. after this point, there was a rapid decrease in total acids to stage  <dig>  after which a steady state of acids was observed in the fruit. from stage  <dig>  there was an increase in citric acid, after which this remained constant through the rest of fruit growth. malic acid was a minor fruit acid accumulated during development .

fruit ethylene responses
in 'hort16a' fruit, many of the physiological changes associated with fruit ripening  occur in the absence of any marked increase in ethylene production . indeed, when the fruit is left on the vine, autocatalytic ethylene was only detected as the fruit progresses into senescence - stage  <dig>  while there is no measurable increase in ethylene production by the fruit during ripening, the capacity of the fruit to respond to exogenous ethylene develops before this time. the application of exogenous ethylene to detached fruit from stage  <dig> can rapidly accelerate fruit softening to eating ripeness . subsequent weekly fruit harvests through to stage  <dig> showed little softening in the fruit left on the vine, but the sensitivity to ethylene increased during this time . in early harvested fruit, the degree of softening was dependent on the duration of ethylene application. continuous ethylene  supply resulted in greater softening than a discrete application of ethylene . the difference in firmness after  <dig> days between fruit treated with either discrete or continuously applied ethylene was reduced from about  <dig> n in fruit at stage  <dig> to <  <dig> n in fruit at stage  <dig>  the rapid softening observed in the ethylene treated fruit did not necessarily coincide with an increase in endogenous autocatalytic ethylene production , as fruit treated for  <dig> hours  did not produce autocatalytic ethylene, while the continuously ethylene-treated fruit did.

to establish the threshold of ethylene needed to induce autocatalytic ethylene production, fruit at stage  <dig> were treated for different periods of  <dig> ul.l- <dig> ethylene  and continuously monitored for ethylene production over the subsequent seven days. none of the control  fruit produced autocatalytic ethylene, and only  <dig> of the 12-hour-treated fruit produced autocatalytic ethylene  . however, 5/ <dig> of fruit treated with ethylene for  <dig> hours produced autocatalytic ethylene between  <dig> hours to  <dig> days following removal from ethylene treatment. all fruit treated with ethylene for  <dig> hours produced ethylene within  <dig> hours of treatment. the increase in ethylene correlated to an increase in respiration rate . following the 7-day period of ethylene measurements, flesh firmness was assessed. fruit from jars with no detectable ethylene remained at around  <dig> n, which is consistent with stage  <dig>  whereas the fruit from jars producing autocatalytic ethylene had progressed to stage  <dig> and beyond, with a firmness of less than  <dig> n.

change in gene expression over fruit development
it is anticipated that future work that uses this scale would include molecular studies. to cater for this, we aimed to extend the physiological scale to include genes with differential expression over fruit development, which may be used as marker genes for the different stages. twenty genes were selected for expression analysis, based on literature searches and the presence of sequences in individual fruit tissue libraries in the kiwifruit est collection. genes were selected with functions that may explain some of the phenotypic changes observed  <cit> . fourteen of these genes showed a single amplification product and demonstrated differences in expression during fruit development. these included a polygalacturonase   <cit> , acc oxidase  <cit> , two expansin  genes, an auxin response factor  and chlorophyll a-b binding protein , a lycopene cyclase  <cit> , a seed maturation protein, a sepallata  <dig>  like gene  <cit>  and four genes associated with starch metabolism, including a β-amylase and sucrose synthase a   <cit>  . expression of the eight genes that best marked different stages of 'hort16a' fruit development is shown in figure  <dig>  expression of the remaining genes overlapped these patterns . during the early stages of development, expression of exp <dig> peaked at stage  <dig> and the arf was highly expressed during stages 71- <dig>  the expression of a cab increased during stages 71- <dig>  expression of the susa gene increased in fruit at stage  <dig> and remained high until fruit senesced . the starch plastid protein showed increased expression in fruit from stage  <dig> through to eating ripeness , while the sep <dig> and β-amylase genes were highly expressed in senescing fruit after stage  <dig> .

discussion
here we have described in detail the physiological changes that occur during on-vine development of actinidia chinensis 'hort16a' fruit, from anthesis to senescence, in relationship to the bbch scale . the bbch scale is a whole-plant scale, designed by crop physiologists to compare growth and development from seed to senescence across plant species, with fruit being only one component of the scale. this results in some studies providing only a coarse description of fruit growth stages, which are hard to apply to a given experiment. with the detailed descriptions of fruit growth given here , a framework is provided for fruit development studies in other cultivars, and other actinidia species. this scale differs from the scale proposed in a whole-plant study for a second kiwifruit species, a. deliciosa 'hayward' by  <cit> . firstly, the principal stage  <dig> is assigned to fully black seed , and secondly, stage  <dig> is assigned to fruit that are beginning to produce autocatalytic ethylene, which was not measured in  <cit> . the invariant principal stages detailed here are likely to be conserved across actinidia, and secondary stages between  <dig> and  <dig> based on final fruit size can easily be translated. the secondary stages between  <dig> and  <dig> are likely to be more species- and cultivar-specific, especially with the range of flesh colour in ripe fruit observed across different actinidia species and cultivars  <cit> . the descriptor for stage  <dig> appears to be conserved, as previous studies in other actinidia species have reported a ripening progression in the absence of autocatalytic ethylene  <cit> .

like many perennial fruit, such as apple  <cit> , grape  <cit> , and citrus  <cit> , 'hort16a' kiwifruit have a long fruit development period. fruit growth spans much of the annual growing season, beginning at anthesis in spring, followed by rapid summer fruit growth, ripening in autumn and finally senescence and abscission of fruit from the vine in winter  <cit> . in contrast, fruit growth and development in tomato occurs over only  <dig>  to  <dig> months, compressing the events of fruit development  <cit> . despite the difference in time to develop, tomato and 'hort16a' fruit have many similarities; they are true fruit  that are ovary-derived, they have similar tissue zones,  and during maturity and ripening the fruit flesh changes colour and the flesh softens. in this study, 'hort16a' fruit growth followed a sigmoidal pattern, in agreement with previous studies  <cit> . the closely related a. deliciosa fruit growth has also been described as having a double  <cit>  or triple  <cit>  sigmoidal growth pattern. in these studies, the additional inflections are likely to be environmentally derived rather than genetically programmed, as shown by the slower period of growth in 'hort16a' during drought in season  <dig>  biphasic growth is also typical of tomato fruit from a range of different genotypes  <cit> . in this study, we have also documented that fruit growth continues during the early stages of fruit ripening, and fruit appear to shrink once they reach eating ripeness and begin to senesce. in both tomato and a. deliciosa, the first stage of growth is dominated by a period of cell division, seed formation and early embryo development  <cit> , which is likely to be true for 'hort16a' in the initial period of development . this period was characterised by rapid changes in the size and development of first the outer and then the inner pericarp tissue, development of seed, as well as expression of an exp <dig> and an arf gene. another feature of this period of rapid growth and development was the greater influx of water compared with carbon into fruit  <cit>  and accumulation of quinic acid  <cit> . the fundamental change from the initial rapid period of growth to a longer period of slowing growth is defined as stage  <dig>  in both tomato and 'hayward' kiwifruit, this change in growth rate indicates the change from predominantly cell division to a period of cell expansion  <cit> .

compared with many other fruit, the ripening response in a. chinensis is unusual. the pattern of ethylene production of 'hort16a' fruit is similar to that of 'hayward' fruit. 'hayward' has been classified as a climacteric fruit  <cit> , despite the fruit ripening in the absence of a marked increase in ethylene production  <cit> . in 'hayward', fruit typically do not produce autocatalytic ethylene until below a firmness of  <dig> n  <cit> , unless damaged in some way, either physically, physiologically or by disease  <cit> . 'hort16a' also ripens in the absence of autocatalytic ethylene production. this contrasts with tomato, where ethylene production increases rapidly at the beginning of fruit ripening. autocatalytic ethylene is only produced by 'hort16a' fruit, after stage  <dig>  and therefore it may therefore be more appropriate to link ethylene production with fruit senescence rather than ripening. because of this, we have included stage  <dig> for senescence in the proposed bbch scale for 'hort16a' . it is important to note, however, that this senescence phase appears to be linked to a tomato ripening response as the ripening inhibitor gene  <cit>  is similar to the arabidopsis sep <dig> gene. the closest kiwifruit homologue of this gene acsep <dig>  <cit>  is upregulated at the point of climacteric ethylene production. this also corresponds to other ripening-associated gene expression; for example, up-regulation of a β-amylase gene  <cit>  was observed during this phase .

while kiwifruit ripening is independent of autocatalytic ethylene production, it appears that endogenous ethylene may play a role in softening. studies with the inhibitor of ethylene action 1-methylcyclopropene  have shown that rapid softening  can be slowed by blocking ethylene action  <cit> . in addition, kiwifruit are particularly sensitive to exogenously applied ethylene and respond by softening rapidly  <cit> . this suggests that basal amounts of ethylene may contribute to the ripening process, while not actually inducing an autocatalytic response. it also suggests that autocatalytic ethylene production has a lower sensitivity to ethylene than fruit softening, which is consistent with the sensitivity/dependency model proposed for apple fruit ripening by.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has detailed the developmental changes that occur during fruit development in 'hort16a' fruit. by aligning this to a bbch scale, we provide a framework for further physiological and molecular studies to be compared, independently of the number of days after anthesis, or environmental effects in any given year.
