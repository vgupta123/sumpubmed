BACKGROUND
soybean  is the largest oil crop in the us. soybean seed oil composition and content are important agronomic traits, determining nutritional value as well as utility for biodiesel production and other industrial applications. a number of key enzymes important for producing storage lipids in oilseed species have been identified  <cit> . studies of developing seeds and/or embryos have suggested that the biosynthetic pathways for fatty acids and lipids are largely regulated at the transcriptional level  <cit> .

the most common genetic variations in eukaryotes are single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> . cultivated soybean and its wild ancestor glycine soja have an estimated average snp frequency of one snp per  <dig>  bp and one snp per 425 bp of contiguous genome sequence, respectively  <cit> . short dna insertions and deletions also contribute to intra-species genomic variation. structural variants resulting from chromosome breaks and repairs, include large-scale chromosomal rearrangements such as inversions, translocations, duplications, large insertions and deletions. presence/absence variations  and copy number variations  have also been shown to play important roles in phenotypic variation. pav and cnv are defined as gains or losses of dna segments usually larger than 1 kb that often contain one or more genes  <cit> . they are prevalent in plant genomes and have been described in soybean as well  <cit> . epigenomic variations, which cause phenotypic diversity in the absence of sequence alterations, are also reflected in changes of gene expression  <cit> . the epigenomes of soybean recombinant inbred lines have recently been analyzed  <cit> . genetic variations with functional significances are transcribed into transcript sequence and expression variations, which eventually lead to phenotypic diversity. identification of transcript sequence and expression variations in oil quality related genes would thus facilitate the discovery of functional variations and accelerate soybean oil quality improvement.

the advent of next generation sequence technologies  has provided an efficient means to simultaneously determine transcript sequences and expression levels on a genome scale. rna-seq offers unique advantages compared to whole genome sequencing. although the soybean genome is  <dig>  gb in size, transcribed sequences account for no more than 100 mb of the entire genome. accordingly, rna-seq reduces the effective genome size and also the associated costs of sequencing to approximately 10% of whole genome sequencing. although non-transcribed regulatory genome sequences cannot be captured by rna-seq, their regulated products, transcript accumulation levels can be measured by rna-seq. thus, rna-seq can effectively determine two functional attributes of a gene, transcript sequence and accumulation level. sequence and expression polymorphisms associated with gene functions could potentially be identified as underlying causes of phenotypic variation.

in soybean research, rna-seq has been applied mainly in determining accumulation of coding and non-coding rnas in a single cultivar  <cit> , while whole genome sequencing has been used for snp discovery, phylogenetic and population genetic studies  <cit> . although rna-seq has recently been utilized in plant species for snp discovery  <cit> , a comprehensive and in-depth characterization and functional annotation of transcript sequence and expression polymorphisms is not yet available for any plant species. as a proof-of-concept, we sequenced seed transcriptomes at a mid-maturation stage of nine soybean lines varying in oil composition and content. we developed and applied a variety of bioinformatic analysis algorithms to identify the sequence and expression variations  among the genotypes, and further predicted their effects on gene function. the transcript polymorphisms of the genes in acyl-lipid related pathways were further characterized to identify transcript polymorphisms potentially leading to changes in oil composition and content among the genotypes. we demonstrated that rna-seq is a fast and cost-effective approach to detect and characterize sequence and expression variations in soybean lines. the collection of transcript polymorphisms provides a valuable resource for discovery of gene and gene variants potentially controlling important oil quality traits and the other seed traits.

RESULTS
soybean genotypes varying in seed oil composition and content
nine soybean genotypes varying in oil composition  and content  were selected for rna sequencing. under our growth condition, r95- <dig> and n0304-303- <dig> represented low oil content genotypes that contained  <dig> % and  <dig> % of oil, respectively. both r05- <dig> and r05- <dig> accumulated 20% oil in their seeds and represented high oil content genotypes. commodity soybean oil is typically composed of 13% palmitic acid , 4% stearic acid , 20% oleic acid , 55% linoleic acid , and 8% linolenic acid   <cit> . the oil composition in some examined lines dramatically differed from that of conventional commodity soybean lines. for example, n0304-303- <dig> had the lowest palmitic acid content with  <dig> %. fam94- <dig> contained  <dig> % of stearic acid, which was significantly higher than that in commodity soybean lines. m <dig> and n0304-303- <dig> were mid-oleic acid genotypes with  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, and had the lowest amount of linoleic acid with  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. n0304-303- <dig> produced the lowest quantity of linolenic acid at  <dig> %.

rna-sequencing and transcript profiles in soybean seeds
transcriptomes of soybean seeds at the mid-maturation stage were sequenced. on average,  <dig> million 100 nt long pair-end sequencing reads were generated for each genotype . sixty-seven percent of the sequence reads aligned uniquely to the reference soybean genome of williams  <dig>  <cit> . the total length of transcribed sequences was  <dig> million nucleotides on average, and accounted for  <dig> % of the soybean genome . an average of 73% of those transcribed sequences aligned to gene models. the mean coverage for transcribed genome sequences and gene models was  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. a total of  <dig>  genes, which included  <dig>  previously annotated gene models, were transcribed in seeds . thus,  <dig> % of the  <dig>  gene models were expressed in soybean seeds.

figure  <dig> shows the distribution of transcribed genes with respect to their transcript accumulation levels. while gene expression varied over several orders of magnitude, the average and median expression levels were  <dig>  and  <dig>  fpkm  respectively. most of the genes were expressed at levels between  <dig>  to  <dig> fpkm.  <dig> % of genes were highly expressed at more than  <dig>  fpkm.  <dig> % of genes had a medium expression level ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> fpkm while  <dig> % were expressed at low levels of less than  <dig> fpkm . the top  <dig> and  <dig> most abundant transcripts accounted for 11% and 50% of all transcripts accumulating in seeds, respectively .

table  <dig> summarizes functions and accumulation levels of the  <dig> most abundant gene transcripts, which accounted for 50% of the total rna population in soybean seeds. the most abundant transcript in seeds accumulated at  <dig>  fpkm, accounting for  <dig> % of all transcripts, encoded a 2s albumin precursor  . the highly abundant seed transcripts encode a variety of well-characterized proteins such as seed storage proteins, protease inhibitors, proteases, acyl lipid enzymes, oil body proteins and late embryogenesis abundant  proteins, and as well proteins of unknown functions. ten of the  <dig> most abundant genes encoded seeds storage proteins, which included four of six functional glycinin genes and four of eight β-conglycinin genes  <cit> . collectively, they amounted to almost one fifth of the total seed transcripts. eleven highly abundant transcripts encoded enzymes and structural proteins involved in acyl lipid metabolism. they included the three lipoxygenases genes, lox <dig>  lox <dig> and lox <dig> <cit>  and the fatty acid desaturase gene, fad2-1b, which encodes one of two enzymes converting oleic acid to linoleic acid. in addition, they contain six oleosin genes and one caleosin gene that function in oil body biogenesis and degradation  <cit> .

identification and characterization of transcript expression polymorphisms
out of  <dig>  genes identified in at least one of the nine lines,  <dig>  genes  were expressed in all nine genotypes .  <dig>  genes were transcribed in one to eight lines, of which the majority  was expressed in eight lines. interestingly,  <dig> genes were only expressed in any one of the lines . the median transcript accumulation value of the genes expressed specifically in one line was  <dig>  fpkm, and was higher than that of genes expressed in multiple lines. these genes encoded proteins with a variety of biological functions and proteins with unknown functions. it will be interesting to investigate the functions of those line-specific transcripts and their contribution to the phenotypic diversity.

a total of  <dig>  genes showed significant variations in their expression levels among the nine lines based on a z-score cutoff at +/- <dig> . r08- <dig> and jack, which contained the highest number of genes exhibiting significant expression variation, had  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes, respectively . other lines had  <dig> to  <dig> genes exhibiting expression variation. more genes showed increased expression over reduced expression . two hundred and seventy genes that had mean expression values equal to or higher than  <dig> fpkm showed at least a 10-fold difference in their transcript accumulation . for example, transcripts of glyma06g <dig>  a gibberellin-regulated family protein gene, accumulated  <dig> times less in r08- <dig> than its average in all lines.

transcript expression polymorphisms of putative acyl lipid genes
a total of  <dig>  genes potentially involved in acyl lipid metabolic and signaling pathways were identified in the soybean genome  based on their sequence similarity with the annotated acyl lipid genes in arabidopsis  <cit> . the genes were categorized into nine functional classes  <cit> . seventy-four percent of the putative acyl lipid genes were expressed in seeds. they included approximately 90% of genes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids in plastids, the synthesis of membrane lipids in endomembrane systems, the metabolism of acyl lipids in mitochondria, and the synthesis and storage of oil . in contrast, only 45% of genes participating in the fatty acid elongation and wax and cutin metabolism were expressed in seeds.

one hundred eighty-eight genes, accounting for 24% of soybean acyl lipid genes, showed variations in their transcript accumulation levels in seeds . a fisher’s exact test revealed that the functional category “synthesis of membrane lipids in plastids” was significantly overrepresented among genes with expression polymorphisms at a p-value of  <dig> . there was no overrepresentation of genes with expression polymorphisms in any other acyl lipid functional category at a p-value cutoff of  <dig> . examples for genes with expression polymorphisms included the fad3a gene  . the fad3a gene encodes a linoleate desaturase in the “synthesis of membrane lipids in plastids” category. while the fpkm and z-score values for fad3a were  <dig>   <dig> and - <dig>  in n0304-303- <dig>  respectively, the average fpkm value for the remaining eight lines was  <dig>  fpkm. the  <dig>  fold decrease in expression was correlated with a decrease in linolenic acid levels . fad3a was the most abundant among the three gene transcripts encoding linoleate desaturases, whose products convert linoleic acid into linolenic acid. the other two homologs, fad3b  and fad3c , had an average accumulation value of  <dig>  and  <dig>  fpkm, respectively. it is likely that the lower expression of fad3a reduces accumulation of linolenic acid levels in n0304-303- <dig>  but the residual fad3a expression in n0304-303- <dig> combined with the fad3b and fad3c expression still result in a substantial amount of linolenic acid in seeds.

identification and characterization of transcript sequence polymorphisms
we identified a total of  <dig>  snps in the nine lines in reference to the williams  <dig> genome at a read depth cut-off of  <dig> reads for each snp . an average of  <dig>  snps were present in each line with a mean coverage of  <dig> reads per snp in annotated genes. jack had the lowest number of snps with  <dig> ; and r08- <dig> had the highest number of snps with  <dig> . r08- <dig> also had the highest number of genes with expression polymorphisms . a comparison of our snp data with those in the single nucleotide polymorphism database   showed that about 82% of the snps in annotated genes had previously been identified, which offered an independent confirmation.

on average, we identified  <dig> snp per  <dig>  nt of transcript sequence. forty-four percent of the  <dig>  genes expressed in seeds contained snps . the genes with and without transcript accumulation polymorphism had similar percentage of snps, suggesting no or little correlation between transcript snps and transcript accumulation polymorphism. the largest group of those genes  had a single snp. the largest bin of genes  showed a snp density between  <dig>  and  <dig> snp per kb length . only  <dig> genes contained more than  <dig> snps per kb.

to identify snps that potentially lead to changes in protein functions, snps in coding regions were categorized into non-synonymous  and synonymous  snps . we detected  <dig> non-synonymous snps that change an amino acid codon into a stop codon,  <dig> non-synonymous snps that change a stop codon into an amino acid codon, and  <dig> snps that eliminate a start codon. in addition, we found  <dig> snps in splice sites that may affect transcript splicing and possibly protein sequence and function. transcripts containing premature termination codons are often degraded by the nonsense-mediated decay  pathway  <cit> . we compared accumulation levels of transcripts in genotypes containing genes with and without premature stop codon. the average accumulation ratio of transcripts with and without the premature stop codon was  <dig> , suggesting that there was no or little correlation between transcript accumulation and presence of a premature stop codon .

distribution of expressed genes and transcript snps within and among chromosomes
the overall distribution patterns of genes were similar among most of the soybean chromosomes. gene density was higher at both chromosome ends, but lower in the intervening regions . however, we also observed variations in the distribution patterns for a number of chromosomes. for example, the gene-rich regions expanded from the chromosomal ends towards the middle more on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  discrete gene-rich regions can also be found in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

overall, the distribution of expressed genes resembled that of genes along each chromosome. while on average, 61% of annotated genes were expressed in seeds, several chromosomal regions were found with highly different percentages of transcribed genes . for example, 85% of annotated genes located between positions  <dig> - <dig> mb on chromosome  <dig> were expressed in seeds. in contrast, only  <dig> % of genes were transcribed in the region between positions 14– <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  the highest densities per chromosome varied between  <dig> and  <dig> expressed genes per  <dig> mb. it has been reported that gene expression in pericentromeric regions is lower than in chromosomal arms  <cit> . interestingly, our preliminary data indicated that there was no correlation between expression levels and chromosomal positions of expressed genes. genes showed similar expression levels along chromosome ends and intervening regions. there was no obvious difference in the distribution of genes with and without expression polymorphisms .

the distribution patterns of the  <dig>  identified snps along chromosomes are shown in figure  <dig>  as expected, snps and expressed genes had similar distribution patterns. the snps densities were often lower at center regions and higher at both chromosomal ends. however, on some chromosome regions, the number of snps per expressed gene varied dramatically from the average. unlike gene and expressed gene densities, maximum snp densities per chromosome varied almost  <dig> fold from  <dig> snps per 1 mb window on chromosome  <dig> to  <dig> snps per 1 mb window on chromosome  <dig> 

characterization of transcript sequence polymorphism related to acyl lipid signaling and metabolic pathways
a total of  <dig>  snps were identified in putative acyl lipid genes . the distribution of those snps among all lines was similar to that of all snps; jack and r08- <dig> had the lowest and the highest number of snps, respectively. among the nine lines,  <dig> snps were located in cds, of which  <dig> were synonymous and  <dig> non-synonymous snps . non-synonymous snps cause a modification of protein sequences that can be benign or deleterious and possibly experience selection. the non-synonymous to synonymous snp  ratio in acyl lipid genes was  <dig>  while the n/s ratio in all examined genes was  <dig> , suggesting that the protein sequence changes were more likely subjected to a negative selection in acyl lipid genes than in the other genes. in addition, we observed that one non-synonymous snp in an e1-e <dig> atpase gene  caused a premature termination codon. another non-synonymous snp in jack abolished a start codon in a protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer protein gene . five snps coincided with splice sites and might change protein sequences and functions.

we tested the putative effect of the non-synonymous snps on protein function by using the prediction tools provean  <cit> , and polyphen- <dig>  <cit> . based on a subset of snps in  <dig> randomly selected acyl lipid genes, 29% of non-synonymous snps were predicted to have deleterious effects on protein function . one of the non-synonymous snps was located in the fab2c gene , which encodes one out of three stearoyl-acyl-carrier-protein desaturases expressed in seeds. this snp altered codon  <dig> from gac to aac, and consequently caused an amino acid change from aspartic acid  to asparagine  . this snp was only present in line fam94- <dig>  this fab2c mutation in fam94- <dig> is likely to result in the increased stearic acid level seen in figure 1a  <cit> . as both homologous genes fab2b  and fab2a  are functional in fam94- <dig>  it is likely that stearic acid can still be converted to oleic acid although at a lower rate. interestingly, we observed that accumulation of the fab2c transcript was reduced in fam94- <dig>  while the transcript accumulation of fab2a  and fab2b  were increased in fam94- <dig>  the increased fab2a and fab2b expression may be able to partially compensate for the reduction of fab2c activity in fam94- <dig> 

the transcript sequencing data also allow discovery of small, one and two bp long indels in addition to large genomic deletions . we identified  <dig>  of small indels in annotated genes, of which  <dig>  indels were located in annotated exons . in contrast to snps,  <dig> % of the exonic indels were situated in utrs while  <dig> % of the small indels were located in coding sequences. the  <dig> indels in coding sequences were expected to change reading frames and amino acid sequences, and were likely to be deleterious to protein function. we also found  <dig> small indels in termination codons and  <dig> in splice sites. thirty-four percent of indels identified in this study were reported in dbsnp.

a total of  <dig> small indels were found in  <dig> putative acyl lipid genes . however, most of them were located in utrs, and only  <dig> indels were present in cds of three genes. for example, a thioesterase/thiol ester dehydrase-isomerase gene  showed a 1 bp homozygous insertion  in the first codon in lines m <dig>  n0304-303- <dig>  r02-6268 f, r05- <dig> and r08- <dig>  a peroxygenase  <dig> gene  contained a 1 bp heterozygous  and a 2 bp homozygous deletion  in codons  <dig> and  <dig> in jack, respectively.

increased expression of a gene cluster in the rhg <dig> locus of jack
we identified a segment consisting of four adjacent genes , whose transcript accumulations were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  times higher in jack than their average expression level in the other eight lines, respectively . interestingly, these genes were located in the previously characterized rhg <dig> locus . it has been reported that overexpression of these genes confers resistance to the soybean cyst nematode  heterodera glycines <cit> . jack is resistant to scn  <cit> . the co-ordinate elevated expression of the four genes is likely to lead to its scn resistance. it has been shown that the copy numbers of a  <dig>  kb fragment containing the four genes vary greatly in soybean lines, and their transcript accumulation is correlated with their copy number  <cit> . the scn resistant fayette cultivar has  <dig> copies while the susceptible williams  <dig> cultivar has just one copy of this  <dig>  kb fragment. we conducted shotgun sequencing of the jack genome at a 10-fold average coverage . interestingly, the coverage for each of the four rhg <dig> genes was between  <dig> and  <dig> reads, indicating a  <dig> to 11-fold copy number increase of these genes. this suggests that the amplification of the rhg <dig> genes leads to their increased transcript accumulation and scn resistance in jack.

assessment of genetic diversity among the nine genotypes
we determined the presence of variant nucleotides at congruent snp positions in all nine soybean lines. a total of  <dig>  snps, which accounted for  <dig> % of all discovered snps, were line-specific . jack had the highest number with  <dig>  snps while r05- <dig> had the lowest number with  <dig> snps to the minor allele frequency  snps. the remaining  <dig>  snps were shared by two to nine lines. a total of  <dig>   snps were present in four lines representing the largest set among shared snps. two thousand six hundred one  snps were common in all nine lines indicating that the reference genome williams  <dig> carries the unique variant nucleotide compared to the nine lines.

we assembled nine pseudo molecules consisting only of nucleotides at all snp positions. their alignments were used to infer the phylogenetic relationship among the nine lines. we generated a maximum likelihood tree based on  <dig>  nucleotide snps . the mean genetic distance was  <dig>  nucleotide substitutions per site. jack and r08- <dig>  the lines with pronounced expression differences, were placed on divergent branches. r05- <dig>  r05- <dig> and r95- <dig> formed a clade. fam94- <dig>  n0304-303- <dig> and m <dig> grouped together on one clade. the general tree topology was supported by bootstrap analysis.

discussion
phenotypic differences identified in inter- or intra-species comparisons could be mostly attributed to transcript sequence and expression polymorphisms of their functionally relevant genes. the availability of next-generation sequencing technologies enables us to sequence entire transcriptomes and simultaneously evaluate transcript sequence and expression variation. we applied the rna-seq technology to examine transcript sequence and expression variations in soybean seeds of nine soybean lines varying in oil composition and content. our results suggest this is a highly effective approach to the identification of transcript polymorphisms . compared to whole genome sequencing, rna-seq represents a genome-reducing technique. the soybean genome is about  <dig>  gb in size with the majority, 59%, consisting mostly of highly repetitive transposable elements  <cit> . the protein-coding genes account for about 10% of the soybean genome while those expressed in seeds fall to about  <dig> %. thus, rna-seq represents more than 15-fold enrichment when compared to dna-sequencing at equal read counts and therefore provides a much more efficient method for identifying sequence variations in expressed soybean seed genes. even though highly abundant transcripts may reduce efficiency in determining less-abundant transcript sequence, since most of these transcripts are important to seed qualities, knowledge about their expression variation is highly valuable for seed quality improvement. in addition, rna-seq focuses on the functional components of the genome. while non-transcribed regulatory elements such as promoter and dna methylation sequences are not captured when using an rna-sequence approach, their effects can still be measured by transcript accumulation. transcript snps were preferentially located in the active recombination portions of the genome. higher recombination rates are preferred as recombination breaks down the high linkage disequilibrium  in cultivated soybean varieties, which improves the resolution of genetic maps and facilitates gene mapping. in addition, our sequence data confirm or improve gene models, splice predictions and annotation of the soybean genome.

north american soybean cultivars have a very narrow genetic base. domestication in asia, introduction of relatively few landraces to the us and subsequent selection in the breeding process represent three genetic bottlenecks that have reduced the soybean gene pool  <cit> . gizlice et al. <cit>  showed that about  <dig> varieties  contribute 95% of alleles found in modern north american soybean cultivars. in this study, we defined the sequence and expression variation of seed transcriptomes from nine soybean lines. sequencing a relatively small number of lines could capture a large portion of common genotypic variations in a species. in arabidopsis, for example,  <dig> diverse varieties contained 90% of the common snps in this species  <cit> . similarly, based on entries in dbsnp, 82% of snps discovered in our nine lines overlapped with snps available from various soybean genotypes. however, sequence variations unique to one line or with lower allele frequencies are often valued in mutant discovery as can be seen with the fab2c allele from fam94- <dig> 

seeds are the sites of reserve production and accumulation rendering them the most valuable part of plants and the target for soybean improvement. while a certain percentage of genes expressed in seeds are housekeeping genes and/or are transcribed in multiple tissues, our data appear consistent with previously published expression profiles on seed development  <cit> , as many of the here-in-identified genes are strictly related to seed development and are exclusively expressed in seeds. a number of those genes are transcribed at high levels and play major roles for enhancing agronomic traits. for example, we found most of the glycinins and β-conglycinins composing 70% of soybean storage proteins highly expressed in seeds, which is in accord with previously published data  <cit> . expression levels of these genes contribute to protein composition and content, and therefore the quality of soy products such as tofu. however, a number of genes whose protein products are not agronomically desirable due to their anti-nutritional effect are expressed in high quantities as well. among those are genes encoding for protease inhibitors including bowman-birk serine protease inhibitors and kunitz trypsin inhibitors that hamper the digestion of soybean proteins in animals and humans  <cit> , and the lipoxygenases involved in oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which add unpleasant flavors to soybean products  <cit> . many of the above mentioned genes show expression variation among the nine lines. for example, the genes coding for glycinin  <dig> and the most abundant kunitz trypsin inhibitor are 46-fold and 6-fold less expressed in line r95- <dig> compared to the average value from the nine lines. seven hundred sixty-eight of the  <dig>  genes putatively involved in acyl lipid metabolism are expressed in seeds, of which  <dig> had expression polymorphism in the nine lines including oleosins  <cit>  and caleosins  <cit> . line r05- <dig>  for instance, displays a 17-fold decrease in the most expressed caleosin. transcript expression variations identified in those lines may be of value in the discovery of underlying molecular regulatory mechanisms and the development of effective breeding strategies for seed quality improvement. additionally, transcript expression variation could potentially be developed into bio-markers for molecular breeding. although transcription factors are important for plant and seed development, they are more often significantly less expressed than structural proteins and enzymes. the high specificity and sensitivity of rna-seq will allow us to investigate expression differences of transcription factor genes as well.

snps are one of the most widely used dna sequence markers in eukaryotes. previously, snps were discovered in various soybean cultivars, land races, elite lines and glycine soja using next generation dna sequencing  <cit>  as well as other methods  <cit> . here we took advantage of rna-seq and identified  <dig>  non-redundant snps in  <dig>  genes. about 63%  of snps are in cds regions. thirty percent  of them are nonsynonymous, causing amino acid substitutions. the effect of those amino acid changes on protein integrity and function can be predicted with algorithms such as provean  <cit> , sift  <cit>  and polyphen- <dig>  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> snps introduced premature termination codons and  <dig> removed stop codons. seventeen snps eliminated the annotated translation initiation codon and  <dig> snps are located at intron splice donor or acceptor sites possibly interfering with transcript splicing. in contrast to snps, the effects of  <dig> and 2 bp indels are more predictable, as the  <dig> indels found in cds interrupt the reading frame and protein sequence while the  <dig> indels identified in splice sites may lead to intron retention and the  <dig> indels found to eliminate termination codons potentially produce a longer protein. sequence variations that affect gene function and cause phenotypic variation represent functional  markers  <cit> . due to complete linkage with trait phenotypes, functional markers are ideal for marker-assisted breeding. this study identified a large collection of sequence polymorphisms  that could lead to protein sequence changes and potentially to biological functional changes in genes. these transcript sequence polymorphism could be further developed into semi-functional or functional markers.

the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions  for all gene models in our nine lines was  <dig> , which is substantially lower than the previously published n/s ratio of  <dig>  in cultivated soybeans  <cit> . the n/s ratio for genes expressed in soybean seeds is slightly higher than that in arabidopsis   <cit> , but less than those in sorghum   <cit>  and rice   <cit> . the differences in these observed ratios might reflect different gene sets, selection criteria, sequence platforms used or allelic expression bias that may be present in rna-seq. in rice and soybean, it has been shown that genes with vital functions seem to have significantly lower nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution ratios, while genes with non-essential functions such as disease resistance genes have higher ratios  <cit> . usually, the majority of substitutions are thought to be eliminated by negative  selection whereas a small amount of nonsynonymous variants are retained by positive selection under natural conditions. accordingly, the n/s ratio is normally used to learn about the selection pressure acting on a system. however, soybean lines have been artificially selected by plant breeders, which caused genetic bottlenecks. therefore, in this situation, n/s ratios may not be used to accurately infer selection pressure  <cit> .

consistent with the previous reports, we independently identified a number of transcript sequence and expression polymorphisms potentially responsible for altered fatty acid composition. we showed that the fab2c  gene encoding a stearoyl-acyl-carrier-protein desaturase had a putatively damaging snp in fam94- <dig>  <cit> . fad3a encodes a linoleate desaturase that introduces a third double bond in linoleic acid to form linolenic acid. cardinal et al. <cit>  suggest that lower expression of the fad3a allele in n0304-303- <dig> is likely to cause a lower level of linolenic acid  content and is mirrored in our finding. m <dig> has a 164 kb deleted region containing the fatty acid desaturase gene fad2-1a <cit>  and therefore, as expected, we detected little more than background expression of the fad2-1a gene in m <dig>  additionally, we detected a coordinated increase in the expression of the four genes comprising the rhg <dig> locus in cultivar jack. the rhg <dig> locus has been shown to control the soybean cyst nematode  resistance trait through copy number variation  <cit> . jack is a scn resistant cultivar and was developed from fayette, whose rhg <dig> locus is amplified by  <dig> fold  <cit> . we show here that the copy number of the genes in this locus was  <dig> fold higher than flanking genome sequences, indicating that the coordinated increased expression of those genes in jack was caused by a copy number amplification.

we generated a valuable collection of sequence and expression variations from these soybean lines, which can be used to address questions in basic and applied soybean research. as mentioned earlier, our sequence polymorphisms are highly applicable for gene mapping approaches and marker-assisted breeding. moreover, existing qtl data may be compared with our sequence and expression polymorphism data to identify possible candidate genes for traits of interest. for example,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> qtls for oil, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid content are currently  listed in soybase , respectively, many of which do not have a causal gene assigned to them. although qtls usually span large regions containing many genes, genes of interest are limited to those that are transcribed in these regions. the transcript polymorphisms discovered here should greatly facilitate identification of the causal genes and gene variants.

the transcript sequence and expression polymorphisms are also useful for eqtl  analysis to identify dna variants that change expression levels and patterns of genes  <cit> . loci controlling gene expression can act at the transcriptional, co-transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. eqtls include snps resulting in rna splicing variations, which have been shown to be one of the underlying causes of expression differences and phenotypic diversity. we are in the process of investigating splice variations and identifying line-specific transcript isoforms among the nine soybean genotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we sequenced seed transcriptomes from nine soybean genotypes varying in oil composition and content, and provided a comprehensive depiction of transcript accumulation and sequence variation in seeds at gene, pathway and systems levels. we identified a large collection of transcript sequence and/or accumulation polymorphisms that could potentially affect gene functions. additionally, we developed a variety of data mining strategies and successfully detected a number of genetic variants potentially causing oil composition and scn resistance changes. transcriptome sequencing can simultaneously determine two major functional attributes of a gene, transcript sequence and accumulation level. although transcriptome sequencing is mainly employed to measure transcriptional changes in a single genotype, the proof-of-concept study demonstrates that transcriptome sequencing could offer an effective approach to explore and exploit genetic diversity for discovering sequence and expression markers, gene variants and genome structure variations important to agronomic traits. the collection of transcript polymorphisms identified in this study could serve as highly effective markers for genetic mapping and gene function discovery in soybean seed quality research.
