BACKGROUND
despite many years of thorough investigations, the molecular basis of latent tuberculosis  infection remains elusive. m. tuberculosis subpopulation associated with latent infection in humans is believed to be in a dormant state characterized by low metabolic status and transient inability to grow and proliferate . the modeling of this specific physiological state has been attempted over years both in vivo  and in vitro . however, in vitro models had limited success, because dormant m. tuberculosis bacilli obtained from the majority of these models were fully culturable, whereas mycobacteria isolated from in vivo models of ltb infection were in non-culturable  state  <cit> .

we have recently identified k+ deficiency as a triggering factor to generate dormant m. tuberculosis bacilli that were nc on solid medium. this m. tuberculosis population was morphologically distinct, and exhibited tolerance to cell wall-targeting antimicrobial agents. these cells were able to reverse quickly to metabolically active state after k+ re-introduction  <cit> . k+ deficiency is a severe stress factor, because k+ balance is crucial for many cellular functions, including maintenance of intracellular ph, osmotic pressure, electrochemical gradient, proton-motive force, and activity of the na+/k+-transporting atpase in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes . consequently, the changes in k+ availability may induce bacterial responses leading to dormancy and non-culturability, which facilitate long-term survival of m. tuberculosis in vivo  <cit> .

transcriptome profiling of nc mycobacteria by microarray technique revealed downregulation of genes associated with central metabolic processes . on the contrary, the genes coding for the uncoupled non-proton-pumping nadh dehydrogenase ii  and nitrate reductases  were significantly induced in nc m. tuberculosis, suggesting that k+ limitation prevents mycobacteria from effectively using proton-motive force generated by respiration, thus driving them to utilize nadh dehydrogenase ii and alternative electron acceptors. moreover, a number of genes implicated in amino acid catabolism were upregulated, and the biosynthetic pathways for fatty acids and mycolic acids were downregulated. this suggests a switch to primary metabolites  as a main carbon source, and indicates unique metabolic adaptation of m. tuberculosis to the nc state  <cit> .

a general problem for the modeling of m. tuberculosis dormancy in vitro is the heterogeneity of the bacterial population, which contains cells of different physiological status  <cit> . therefore, the elimination of metabolically active cells is a prerequisite for establishing a model of m. tuberculosis dormancy. to remove a subpopulation of metabolically active cells  remaining in the population of dormant mycobacteria generated by k+ deficiency and to obtain a homogeneous population of nc cells, a 15-day k+-starved m. tuberculosis culture was treated with a moderate concentration of rifampicin , which eliminated dividing cells  <cit> , but did not affect the viability of dormant mycobacteria  <cit> . as a result, a so-called ‘zero-cfu’  population of nc m. tuberculosis was obtained. the ‘zero-cfu’ population was completely unable to grow on solid medium but retained full potential to recover to physiologically active state, as evidenced by the most probable number  assay  <cit> . this highly homogeneous nc m. tuberculosis population is much more suitable for transcriptome profiling. elucidation of specific metabolic processes involved in maintenance of dormant state and preservation of m. tuberculosis viability may improve our understanding of ltb infection in humans.

a recently introduced rna sequencing  technology based on next-generation sequencing  overcomes most limitations characteristic for microarray assays. unlike microarrays, rna-seq technology does not require transcript-specific probes and allows detection of non-coding transcripts; moreover, rna-seq determines gene expression levels as digital values  <cit> . thus, rna-seq is a suitable approach for the reliable analysis of dormant transcriptomes with very low mrna levels.

in this study, we present, for the first time, rna-seq analysis of the dormant nc m. tuberculosis population obtained under k+ deficiency, which is characterized by a ‘zero-cfu’ phenotype and high  recovery potential. we compared transcriptional adaptation of m. tuberculosis at different stages of dormancy, including the prolonged ‘zero-cfu’ state. dormant m. tuberculosis transcriptome was found to be enriched in small non-coding regulatory rna molecules. despite a negligible level of metabolic activity, dormant mycobacteria of the ‘zero-cfu’ phenotype were found to express certain levels of individual transcripts, which were stable in the nc state for at least several days. protein-coding transcripts stabilized in dormant nc cells could be utilized during further resuscitation steps.

RESULTS
modeling non-culturability
we have recently developed an in vitro model of nc m. tuberculosis by culturing mycobacteria in k+-deficient conditions. after 40 days of incubation, nc mycobacteria were characterized by distinctive morphology and tolerance to cell wall-targeting antibiotics. however these cells were susceptible to rifampicin  <cit> . the susceptibility of nc mycobacteria to rifampicin may probably be explained by the presence of susceptible subpopulation of active cells remaining in the culture . therefore, to enrich nc population and remove dividing cells, rifampicin  was added to m. tuberculosis cultures k+-starved for 14 days  <cit> , which resulted in a gradual decrease in the number of culturable mycobacteria until it reached zero after 10 days of incubation with rifampicin . nc cells with the ‘zero-cfu’ phenotype demonstrated high ability to recover metabolic activity and proliferate in the resuscitation medium , as evidenced by the mpn assay, and previously have been successfully used for screening of drugs targeting non-replicating mycobacteria  <cit> .fig.  <dig> samples used for rna-seq analysis. a experimental flow. formation of a ‘zero-cfu’ m. tuberculosis population under k+ deficiency and a moderate concentration of rifampicin . filled squares, cfu counts; filled circles, mpn counts. the experiment was repeated five times with similar results. a typical experiment is shown. the standard deviation for cfu did not exceed  <dig> to 20 % for the cfu mean and  <dig> to 30 % for the mpn mean. b the quantity of total mrna  in the de, dm, and dl cultures to that in the log cultures 



the total level of mrna significantly decreases in dormant cells
transcriptional profiling of different m. tuberculosis populations was performed by rna-seq. k+-deficient cultures at the logarithmic growth phase  were compared with early dormant , and rifampicin-treated ‘zero-cfu’ middle dormant  and late dormant  mycobacteria to determine the changes accompanying k+-deficiency, transition to dormancy, and prolonged persistence of dormant nc cells, respectively . three independent replicates allowed estimating biological variability and identifying differentially expressed genes. after sequencing, we mapped the reads to m. tuberculosis h37rv genome, and calculated mapping statistics . the percentages of non-rrna reads mapped to different annotated features are shown in table  <dig>  we noted that markedly lower proportion of reads were mapped to protein-coding genes in dm and dl cultures in comparison with de , suggesting a significant decrease of transcriptional activity in ‘zero-cfu’ m. tuberculosis cells. therefore, to obtain unbiased rpkm values, we normalized the number of reads mapped to a protein-coding gene to the number of reads mapped to all protein-coding and non-coding rna genes, excluding reads mapped to rrna, and trna genes. rpkm values were not calculated for duplicated genes or instances, where less than five reads were mapped to a gene . to compare correlation within and between replicates, we selected the genes with assigned rpkm values for all samples and calculated spearman correlation coefficients . all samples within triplicates demonstrated high correlation . comparison between replicates showed that dm and dl cultures were very similar in their transcriptional profiles  and might even be considered to represent the same biological sample, indicating that the protein-coding transcriptome of dormant m. tuberculosis did not significantly change after prolonged persistence. interestingly, de and dm cultures showed slightly higher correlation  than log and de cultures . the difference between correlation coefficients was statistically significant   <cit> . therefore, the transition of mycobacteria to early dormancy  induced more pronounced changes in the transcriptome than the conversion of the remaining 10 % of dividing mycobacteria in population to nc state and formation of ‘zero-cfu’ culture, which is consistent with quantitative assessment of the population structure.table  <dig> mapping statistics

the numbers in the rows one to four represent the percentage of non-rrna reads mapped to the indicated rna types for each of the four m. tuberculosis states. the percentage of reads mapped to intergenic and antisense rna to the reads mapped to coding sequences  in sense orientation are shown in the fifth and sixth rows



our rna-seq mapping statistics suggested that the total level of mrna significantly decreased in dm and dl transcriptomes. the change of mrna content per cell may result from:  the change of the total quantity of rna per cell, and  the change of proportion of mrna in the transcriptome. to estimate the first component, we normalized the quantity of rna isolated from log and dm cells to the quantity of dna isolated from these cells. the quantity of dna proved to be a robust parameter for estimation of the number of cells for mycobacteria  <cit> . in slow-growing mycobacteria, the quantity of dna per cell seems to be relatively constant at different growth rates: m. bovis bcg was predicted to contain  <dig>  fg of dna per cell at a doubling time  <dig>  h− <dig> and  <dig>  fg of dna per cell at a doubling time  <dig>  h− <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we may assume that in our model the quantity of dna per cell remained constant. our results showed that rna/dna ratio in log cells  was almost equal to rna/dna ratio in dm cells, cultivated under rifampicin . these data suggested that the quantity of rna per cell remained constant at different time points in our model.

to estimate the change of proportion of mrna in the transcriptome we normalized the quantity of total mrna to the quantity of 16s ribosomal rna. the total mrna pool represents a minor proportion  of the transcriptome in bacteria  <cit> . the proportion of mrna of a certain gene in the transcriptome  is composed of  the proportion of total mrna in the transcriptome  and  the proportion of this mrna molecule in total mrna pool, which may be represented by rpkm value. therefore, if we compare samples a and b, the change of proportion of individual mrna in total transcriptome  may be represented as: qbqa=mrnab×rpkmbmrnaa×rpkma 

to measure the change of proportion of individual mrna in total transcriptome  we employed qrt-pcr with 16s rrna as a reference gene. ribosomal rnas constitute a dominant fraction  of the total rna in bacterial cells  <cit>  and rrna levels are considered to be relatively constant at most growth rates  <cit> . therefore, in the condition of decreased mrna content, 16s rrna is an appropriate reference gene to calculate the quantity of individual mrnas in total transcriptome.

to represent the ratio of total mrna in sample b to that in sample a we introduced the value mb/a: mb/a=mrnabmrnaa=qpcrb/a16s×rpkmarpkmb 

we chose  <dig> genes and measured changes of their expression in samples de, dm and dl relative to log by qrt-pcr, using 16s rrna gene as a reference . as we were unable to obtain pcr products for the genes with low rpkm values in dm and dl samples, highly expressed  genes were chosen for the analysis. spearman correlation coefficients between changes of expression measured by rpkm and qpcr were:  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>  . on the basis of qpcr data and rpkm for  <dig> selected genes we calculated m-values for samples de, dm and dl relative to log . according to average m-values, the quantity of mrna relative to 16s rrna was maximal in log, slightly decreased in de, and significantly decreased  in dm and dl cultures.

differential expression of protein-coding genes on dormancy
despite significant transcriptional repression in dm and dl cultures, the expression of protein-coding genes in these samples could be assessed by rna-seq. to find differentially expressed genes we used edger software  <cit>  . this algorithm does not rely on rpkm. therefore, there are differences between fold changes calculated with edger and by direct comparison of rpkm values. we performed pair-wise comparisons between log and de transcriptomes , de and dm transcriptomes , and dm and dl transcriptomes .

after calculating differential expression values, we normalized them to the quantity of total mrna using m-values . we noted, however, that there were no protein-coding genes, whose absolute expression level increased or remained at the same level in dm or dl relative to de. additionally, earlier we noted that transcriptional profiles in dm and dl were quite similar to that in de, suggesting that despite significant downregulation, the relative representation of transcripts in mrna pool did not show dramatic changes. this prompted us to examine differential expression using non-normalized expression values. in this case, we measured changes of relative representation of individual transcripts in the total mrna pool, but not the absolute quantities of the transcripts in cells. to facilitate the search for meaningful changes in gene expression, we implemented gene set enrichment analysis using functional categories from tuberculist and patric databases  <cit> . for this analysis, we chose the genes that showed more than two-fold statistically significant up- or downregulation. the results of functional enrichment analysis are shown in additional file 6: table s <dig> 

comparison of log and de cultures
k+-deficient conditions reduced the levels of transcripts encoding nadh dehydrogenase complex i  and succinate dehydrogenase complex , whereas the genes encoding two copies of nadh-dehydrogenase complex ii were either significantly upregulated  or unchanged  . we also observed a significant downregulation of expression of the components of the cytochrome c pathway in the electron transport chain such as bc <dig> complex  and aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase . in contrast, the genes encoding cytochrome bd  were expressed at the same level. the genes encoding the components of f0f <dig> atp-synthase were also downregulated during cultivation in k+-deficient media. other groups of genes that showed significant downregulation were those encoding transport complexes mce <dig> and mce <dig>  and proteins implicated in phosphate transport. pe-pgrs genes showed dramatic changes: among  <dig> genes,  <dig> showed statistically significant upregulation in de cells, and most of them remained upregulated in dm and dl cells, where pe-pgrs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were expressed at relatively high levels.fig.  <dig> red-green display summarizing regulation of the selected genes. gene expression ratios were determined using the edger package, log <dig> transformed, normalized to the average level across the samples and displayed according to the color code. gene groups were retrieved from the patric database and modified. a the groups of genes with differential representation in the log and de samples. b the groups of genes with differential representation in the de and dm samples, and dm and dl samples



comparison of de and dm cultures
after formation of mycobacteria with ‘zero-cfu’ phenotype , the expression of genes encoding enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glyoxylate and methylmalonate pathways was significantly repressed . this tendency was already detected in de cultures and became more pronounced dm and dl. in contrast, icl <dig> encoding isocitratelyase and mutab encoding methylmalonyl-coa mutase, the key enzymes of glyoxylate and methylmalonyl pathways, respectively, were upregulated in de mycobacteria and remained upregulated in dm and dl cultures. the genes encoding ribosomal proteins and mmpl <dig> gene cluster were significantly downregulated in dm and dl cells.

the only group of genes that showed statistically significant upregulation was the group of genes encoding vitamin b12-synthesizing enzymes including cobalamin biosynthetic operon cobjhklm.

comparison of dm and dl cultures
as shown above, both dm and dl mycobacteria were characterized by equally low rna content and similar transcriptional profiles. nevertheless, we were able to identify  <dig> genes with more than two-fold statistically significant up- and downregulation . mmpl <dig> gene cluster was significantly downregulated in dl relative to de . surprisingly, some genes involved in the biosynthetic processes, including ribd , cyso , grcc <dig> , and pcka  were upregulated in persisting nc m. tuberculosis. the transcripts of several genes involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism such as desa <dig> and desa <dig> , fade <dig> and fade <dig> , ech <dig> , fabd , hsae , and pks <dig>  were also upregulated during the transition from the middle dormant  to late dormant  state.

we also found that several genes involved in the expression and function of ribosomal proteins, including rpmj and rpmi, rpsq and rpsm, rplk and rbfa , grea , sigl and rsbw  were upregulated on late dormancy. the genes involved in cell adaptation and repair, including those coding for chaperons, heat shock proteins, and toxin-antitoxin  modules, were also found to be markedly overrepresented on late dormancy: msrb , serb <dig> , hsp , htpx , clpb , pip , vapbc <dig>  and vapbc <dig> . the genes involved in detoxification reactions such as cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  and protein degradation such as gcvb  and mpa  also demonstrated upregulation in dl versus dm cells.

non-coding transcriptome
recent studies have identified multiple non-coding rnas  in m. tuberculosis . according to our mapping statistics , the quantity of intergenic transcripts  and the relative quantity of antisense rnas to protein-coding transcripts increased in dormant m. tuberculosis, suggesting that ncrna molecules are upregulated relative to protein-coding transcripts.

by visual inspection of transcriptional profiles, we identified  <dig> candidate ncrna molecules, including  <dig> intergenic small rnas and  <dig> antisense rnas . all intergenic small rnas and two antisense rnas have been previously reported .

according to rpkm values several ncrnas demonstrated increased expression in dormant cells : ncrv0539c  was  <dig> times upregulated in de cells; ncrv1162c  was  <dig> times upregulated in de cells followed by moderate downregulation in dm and dl cells; ncrv <dig>   <cit>  was  <dig> times upregulated in de and further increased in dm and dl cells.

since small intergenic rnas mts <dig>  mts <dig>  and mts <dig> were found to be most abundant in dormant nc mycobacteria , we analyzed their expression at different dormancy stages using qrt-pcr . expression of mts <dig> remained constant in de, but was significantly decreased in dm and dl cells. mts <dig> demonstrated significant accumulation in de cultures, whereas mts <dig> level remained constant throughout the dormancy, in contrast to the general transcriptional repression in dormant m. tuberculosis. thus, the dormant transcriptome of mycobacteria was proved to be enriched in ncrnas.fig.  <dig> expression levels of small rnas mts <dig>  mts <dig>  and mts <dig>  expression levels were determined by qpcr using 16s rrna as a reference. expression levels for three replicates along with the standard error of the mean are shown on the plots



overexpression of m. tuberculosis non-coding rnas affects the growth rate
next, we examined functional roles of small rnas in m. tuberculosis. two highly expressed small rna molecules mts <dig> and mts <dig> were cloned in the plasmid vector under the control of the strong rrnb promoter of m. smegmatis and transformed into m. tuberculosis cells. the overexpression of both mts <dig> and mts <dig> in m. tuberculosis resulted in slow bacterial growth in liquid medium  with more pronounced phenotype for mts <dig> fig.  <dig> growth curves of m. tuberculosis overexpressing mts <dig> and mts <dig>  mycobacteria were cultured in sauton medium supplemented with adc and tween- <dig> at 37 °c with agitation ; m. tuberculosis transformed with the empty pmv <dig> vector was used as negative control



cleavage of 23s rrna is a hallmark of dormant cells
the examination of total rna quality by gel electrophoresis revealed the fragmentation of 23s rrna in de, dm, and dl cultures . northern blot analysis showed that the major cleavage point was located approximately 600 nt from the 5′ end of 23s rrna. almost half of the 23s rrna molecules in dm bacteria were cleaved . the primer extension assay was used to map the exact position of the cleavage site between residues g <dig> and a <dig>  the cleavage occurred in de cultures, i.e., during the initial phase of dormancy, and became more pronounced in dm and dl mycobacteria . in 23s rrna, the cleavage site is located in a single-strand region near helix  <dig> of domain i ; however, this region does not participate in the catalytic activity of ribosomes. therefore, the role of site-specific 23s rrna cleavage in m. tuberculosis dormancy remains to be elucidated.fig.  <dig> cleavage of 23s rrna. a non-denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis of total rna isolated from the log, de, dm, and dl m. tuberculosis cultures. b northern blotting with the probes complementary to 5′ and 3′ ends of 23s rrna from the log and dm cells. c primer extension analysis with the primer pe_ <dig> complementary to 23s rrna. rna was isolated from the log, de, dm, and dl cells. the cloned 23s rdna fragment was also analyzed by sanger sequencing with pe_ <dig>  the arrow indicates the cleavage site. d the structure of helix  <dig> and the adjacent region of m. tuberculosis 23s rrna. the cleavage site is indicated by the arrow. the structure was adopted from www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu  <cit>  and modified



discussion
to perform transcriptional profiling of dormant nc cells by rna-seq, we employed a previously developed model of non-culturability in k+-deficient medium, which has been earlier used for transcriptome analysis of dormant versus dividing mycobacteria by microarray  <cit> . however, in the previous study we used a heterogeneous population containing, along with nc cells, a minor subset of dividing cells . the addition of a moderate concentration of rifampicin allowed to eliminate this subset of metabolically active mycobacteria  <cit>  and to obtain a homogenous population of dormant cells with the ‘zero-cfu’ phenotype.

in the present study, we demonstrated a significant decrease in total mrna content in dormant m. tuberculosis , which indicates global repression of all protein-coding genes on dormancy. the problem of comparing gene expression levels in samples with different mrna content has been recently addressed for eukaryotic cells. aanes et al. proposed an approach that uses experimentally measured polya+ rna amounts as scales to normalize expression levels in different samples  <cit> . another strategy employed rna spike-in controls in quantities proportional to the number of cells and estimated scaling factors based on local regression   <cit> .

in this study, we employed a two-step approach: firstly, we calculated rna to dna ratio as a measure of total rna content per cell in compared samples. secondly, we normalized the quantity of total mrna to the quantity of 16s ribosomal rna in compared samples. our results suggested that the quantity of rna per cell was equal at different points in our model. however, dormant cells dm and dl with the ‘zero-cfu’ phenotype experienced 30– <dig> fold downregulation of total mrna. the downregulation of transcription was so dramatic that there were no genes, whose expression was upregulated in absolute values. therefore, we performed differential expression analysis in terms of relative representation of particular transcripts in the whole mrna pool, and not their absolute quantities per cell.

the observed global transcriptional repression of protein-coding genes may be a strategy to maintain dormancy by arresting cell metabolic activity. what is the nature of mrnas detected in nc cells? it is known that under normal conditions, individual transcripts in bacterial cells have a very short lifetime , and the presence of mrna in nc mycobacteria in the absence of rna synthesis appeared rather unexpected. hu et al. were the first to demonstrate the preservation of several individual mrna molecules in rifampicin-treated m. tuberculosis cells using rt-pcr; however, global transcriptome was not analyzed  <cit> . a recent study has shown a significant increase in the average mrna half-life in m. tuberculosis with the decrease in cultivation temperature and under hypoxic conditions  <cit> . in our model of non-culturable m. tuberculosis, we observed a dramatic decrease in transcriptional activity for dormant mycobacteria as indicated by the rate of uracil incorporation  <cit> . however, we found that dormant nc cells are characterized by the low-abundance but stable transcriptome for at least 10 days of persistence in the ‘zero-cfu’ state. the population of stable individual transcripts in dormant m. tuberculosis probably represents mrna molecules synthesized in the early stages of k+-deficiency and stabilized in the nc state, when de novo rna synthesis is evidently blocked.

the analysis of persisting transcripts with significantly increased  relative representation in the late dormancy revealed a cohort of mrna molecules coding for biosynthetic enzymes, proteins involved in adaptation and repair processes, detoxification, and control of transcription initiation. although active metabolic reactions are suppressed in dormant nc m. tuberculosis with the ‘zero-cfu’ phenotype, this cohort of stable mrna molecules could represent a pool of readily activable transcripts preserved for the initial stage of resuscitation as it has been suggested for mrna found in bacillus subtilis spores  <cit> .

the most prominent feature of the transcriptome from m. tuberculosis with ‘zero-cfu’ phenotype was downregulation of the genes encoding ribosomal proteins . a similar transcriptional signature has previously been observed during starvation  <cit> , stationary phase, in the wayne model  <cit> , and in persistent mycobacteria after antibiotic treatment  <cit> . in our model, the decrease in transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins occurred only after the transition to ‘zero-cfu’ state and not as an early response to К+-deficiency, which may represent a specific feature of m. tuberculosis adaptation to prolonged dormancy, when only the cells not expressing ribosomal proteins could survive.

a striking feature of the nc transcriptome is a significant proportion of small ncrnas. recently, multiple ncrna molecules were discovered in m. tuberculosis , where they are thought to participate in the regulation of general stress responses  <cit> . however, the investigation of the roles of small ncrnas in m. tuberculosis has just started  <cit> . in the present study, two small rna molecules mts <dig> and mts <dig> were found to be very abundant in nc mycobacteria characterized by the ‘zero-cfu’ phenotype. both mts <dig> and mts <dig> have been identified earlier in m. tuberculosis and m. bovis  <cit> . it has been shown that these small rnas are induced in the stationary phase of mycobacterial cultures  <cit> , which is consistent with our results demonstrating that mts <dig> and mts <dig> overexpression resulted in growth inhibition , suggesting the role of these small rnas in the transition to dormancy and maintenance of the nc status. arnvig et al. have demonstrated that overexpression of another small rna, mts <dig>  also resulted in slow growth of m. tuberculosis  <cit> . interestingly, mts <dig> is considered to be involved in camp-dependent regulatory processes. expression of this small rna is dependent on the synthesis of adenylate cyclase  and camp levels  <cit> . we have recently demonstrated that intracellular camp levels regulate the early stages of m. smegmatis resuscitation from the dormant nc state  <cit> . cumulatively, these data suggest that mts <dig> may be involved in the control of camp production in m. tuberculosis and thus may participate in the transition to a slow-metabolism state and in the formation of the nc phenotype, when abundant mts <dig> expression would arrest nc cell growth until conditions are appropriate for resuscitation.

another feature of dormant m. tuberculosis was the cleavage of 23s rrna between residues g <dig> and a <dig>  generally, rrna cleavage by endoribonucleases initiates its degradation during stress conditions, leading to the accumulation of small rrna fragments for further degradation to mononucleotides by exoribonucleases  <cit> . if uncontrolled, this process is detrimental and may lead to cell death  <cit> . during hypoxia, mycobacteria stabilize their ribosomes by keeping 30s and 50s ribosomal subunits in the associated form; the inability to stabilize ribosomes results in their degradation and loss of cell viability  <cit> . in our model, rrna remained fragmented but not completely degraded even after prolonged persistence in the nc state. the cleavage site is located in a single-strand region near helix  <dig> of domain i, which could interact with ribosomal proteins l <dig> and l <dig>  <cit> . the analysis of e. coli ribosome crystal structure  has shown that the region around the cleavage site is surface-exposed  <cit>  and thus would be readily accessible for proteases.

ribosomal rna cleavage may be due to the activity of the toxin-antitoxin  systems of m. tuberculosis  <cit> . thus, it has been shown that mycobacterial toxin mazf-mt <dig> can disable protein synthesis by cleaving 23s rrna at a functionally essential region located in ribosomal a site  <cit>  and that toxin vapc <dig> can inhibit translation by the cleavage of the sarcin-ricin loop in 23s rrna  <cit> . in our model, several ta modules such as mazef <dig>  mazef <dig>  vapbc <dig>  vapbc <dig>  vapbc <dig>  and vapbc <dig> demonstrated significant upregulation in dormant cells .

despite significant upregulation of mazef <dig> and vapbc <dig> ta loci, we did not observe cleavage of 23s rrna at the cleavage sites specific for these toxins. indeed, activity of ta systems is mainly regulated at posttranscriptional level: degradation of antitoxin proteins induces activity of toxins  <cit> . therefore, transcriptional upregulation does not necessarily indicate activation of ta modules.

CONCLUSIONS
transcriptomic profiling of dormant nc m. tuberculosis by rna-seq revealed, for the first time, a global transcriptional repression of protein coding genes. the analysis of residual low-abundant transcripts displayed a cohort of mrna molecules coding for biosynthetic enzymes, proteins involved in adaptation and repair processes, detoxification, and control of transcription initiation. a remarkable transcriptome stability of long-persisting dormant mycobacteria found in this study suggests effective adaptation mechanisms underlying readiness of nc mycobacteria to resuscitation. the mrnas in dormant cells may represent a pool of stable transcripts, which are rapidly translated upon resuscitation from dormancy. the cleavage of 23s rrna at a specific point and the abundance of several small ncrnas in nc m. tuberculosis may indicate their significance for the maintenance of dormancy and suggest the molecular basis of ltb infection.
