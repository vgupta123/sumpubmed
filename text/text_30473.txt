BACKGROUND
water immersion activates several distinct somatosensory modalities, including tactile, pressure, and thermal sensations. somatosensory inputs can induce a variety of cardiovascular and respiratory responses, including decreased heart rate, increased stroke volume  <cit> , and reduced functional residual capacity  <cit> . these physiological responses can have therapeutic benefits; indeed, water immersion is used as part of rehabilitation regimes for orthopedic, cardiovascular, and respiratory disorders. water immersion once a week also improved the activities of daily living  in some frail elderly and hemiplegic patients after stroke  <cit> . benefits to neurological patients suggest that water immersion may influence cerebrocortical processing, but this remains to be determined. elucidating the cortical somatosensory processes induced by water immersion and the effects of water immersion on the processing of other sensory inputs will help delineate the mechanisms of sensory integration and could facilitate the development of improved aquatic therapies for neurology patients.

somatosensory input from peripheral nerves activates several cortical areas. this modulation of somatosensory input can be evaluated by somatosensory-evoked potentials . seps are divided into short-latency and long latency types. short-latency seps  are generated in area 3b and/or area  <dig> during thalamocortical inputs  <cit>  and reflect the first stage of cortical somatosensory processing. many reports have shown that somatosensory input attenuates short-latency cortical seps evoked by median nerve stimuli in the cerebral cortex or in the subcortical structures during movement  <cit>  and in the presence of interfering tactile stimuli  <cit> . in  <dig>  jones et al.  <cit>  investigated whether short-latency seps evoked by median nerve stimuli were affected by various interfering tactile stimuli, and proposed that short-latency seps could be influenced by light touch stimuli of the body. in scalp recordings, continuous interfering tactile stimuli applied to the median nerve distribution of the hand primarily affected early sep components peaking at about 20- <dig> ms, inverting the polarity between the parietal and frontal regions  <cit> . subsequently, jones et al.  <cit>  showed that short-latency seps generated in somatosensory cortical areas 3b and  <dig> were attenuated by interfering tactile stimuli and cutaneous pressure  <cit> . based on these studies, it appears that somatosensory inputs evoked by water immersion, such as the tactile sense of water and hydrostatic pressure, may affect the short-latency seps generated in areas 3b and  <dig> 

in our previous study using functional near infrared spectroscopy , water immersion was associated with increased oxygenated hemoglobin  concentrations within the sensorimotor area of the cortex, including areas 3b and  <dig>  this finding suggests that the somatosensory input from water immersion might activate this cortical area  <cit> . however, to the best of our knowledge, there is no direct evidence that water immersion has any effect on somatosensory cortical processing. in the present study, we examined the effect of water immersion on the short-latency seps in response to median nerve stimuli. based on the aforementioned results, we hypothesized that somatosensory inputs from water would attenuate these short-latency seps.

RESULTS
discussion
water immersion has been shown to benefit many patients, including patients recovering from stroke, suggesting that this form of therapy might alter cortical activity. in the present study, such an effect was directly demonstrated under controlled experimental conditions. water immersion significantly attenuated short-latency seps evoked by median nerve stimuli. while the amplitudes of the central n <dig>  p <dig>  and n <dig>  the frontal p <dig> and n <dig>  and the parietal n <dig> and p <dig> components were not changed significantly by water immersion, the parietal p <dig> and p <dig> amplitudes as well as the central p <dig> amplitude were significantly smaller under the immersed condition. these results suggest that water immersion has a gating effect on short-latency seps evoked by median nerve stimuli, and can therefore influence the cortical processing of somatosensory inputs.

water immersion can alter numerous physiological parameters depending on physical characteristics like buoyancy, hydrostatic pressure, and temperature. water immersion can provide relief from edema and improve blood flow  <cit> , and these effects are beneficial for the rehabilitation of patients with orthopedic  <cit> , cardiovascular  <cit> , or respiratory disorders  <cit> . on the other hand, the effects of water immersion on somatosensory cortical processing have never been examined, despite the fact that water immersion is a form of multimodal somatosensory stimulation, engaging tactile-, pressure-, and thermosensitive pathways, and so would be expected to evoke widespread cortical activity. the present results provide a foundation for further studies on the benefits of aquatic rehabilitation for frail elderly and patients with neurological disorders, such as hemiplegic stroke patients.

somatosensory inputs can attenuate short-latency seps evoked by other inputs, most often stimulation of the median nerve  <cit> . jones et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that interfering tactile stimuli, such as continuous rubbing of the palm ipsilateral to the median nerve, attenuated p <dig> and p <dig> due to centripetal gating. acupuncture and tactile stimulation with a soft nylon brush to the ipsilateral palm also attenuated the parietal p <dig>  evoked by median nerve stimuli  <cit> . the author  <cit>  suggested that the suppression of p <dig> is due to a uniform decrease in neuronal activity within the somatosensory area due to "afferent inhibition"  <cit> .

we were uncertain why attenuation of the p <dig> component occurred in the present study under immersion conditions, since the hand that was innervated by the median nerve was not actually in the water. according to an earlier study  <cit>  that examined changes in the waveform of seps due to continuous tactile stimuli to various parts of the body, including the face, hand, forearm, and foot both ipsilateral and contralateral to the median nerve stimuli, tactile stimuli of remote regions resulted in a consistent difference in the waveforms of short-latency seps. the authors proposed that this may be analogous to the phenomenon of "surround inhibition" described by mountcastle and powell  <cit>  in which single unit responses were observed in the sensory cortex of the monkey. additionally, they suggested that all areas of the skin may influence the cortical responses induced by median nerve stimuli. therefore, somatosensory input from the whole of the body while immersed in water may have resulted in attenuation of the p <dig> component in the present study, but further studies are necessary to confirm this possibility and determine the underlying mechanisms.

the mapped p <dig> field is always confined to the contralateral parietal scalp and is thought to reflect activation in the various somatosensory receiving areas  <cit> . indeed, patients with complete parietal vascular lesions and hemianesthesia lost both n <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> . desmedt and tomberg  <cit>  examined the topographical patterns of short-latency seps and proposed that p <dig>  which corresponds to p <dig> in the present study, reflects radially oriented neural generators in parietal area  <dig>  short-latency  responses are generated mainly in areas 3b and  <dig> of the contralateral si  <cit> . in a previous study that examined intracortical connectivity to the afferent input from skin in monkeys, area  <dig> was shown to receive a direct thalamocortical projection from the vplc, as well as a corticocortical projection from area 3b  <cit> . according to a functional magnetic resonance imaging  study, activity in areas  <dig> and  <dig> increased when pressure without pain was applied to the fingertip and antebrachial regions  <cit> . therefore, the attenuation of p <dig> in the present study suggests that the somatosensory input from the immersed area of skin could alter excitability in areas 3b and  <dig> 

the p <dig> field is inconsistent in young adults and its distribution over the scalp is quite variable. it always involves the contralateral central region, but can also extend over the front of the scalp  <cit> . this is in agreement with the present results, as 40- <dig> ms responses were found at all electrodes. furthermore, p <dig> was recorded precentrally in a patient with complete destruction of the parietal cortex  <cit> ; therefore, the p <dig> generator cannot be uniquely parietal.

the attenuation of p <dig> in the present study could be explained due to several cortical activities which were induced by the somatosensory input from water. kawashima et al.  <cit>  reported that attenuation of p <dig>  was induced by interfering tactile stimuli. they suggested that the generator of p <dig> is area  <dig> based on the dipole tracing method. however, others have proposed that the generator of p <dig> is located in si  <cit> . as described above, although the generator of p <dig> is still unknown, it is possible that p <dig> reflects activity in the si. therefore, somatosensory input to the si as the result of water immersion might induce the attenuation of p <dig> 

an added possible explanation for the attenuation of p <dig> involves that there is an effect from activity in the ppc. mauguiere et al.  <cit>  proposed that p <dig> in healthy adults could reflect activity in several areas of the parietal cortex, including si and the ppc. inui et al.  <cit>  investigated the temporal relationship among cortical responses to somatosensory stimuli using magnetoencephalography  and found that the activities peaking at  <dig> and  <dig> ms were located in the postcentral gyrus, corresponding to the ppc. although a few meg studies reported activation in this area at a latency of 50- <dig> ms following somatosensory stimuli  <cit> , the main inputs to this area are from areas  <dig> and  <dig> in macaque monkeys  <cit> . therefore, somatosensory input from water immersion to the ppc via si might lead to the attenuation of p <dig>  furthermore, inui et al.  <cit>  proposed a hierarchical scheme of somatosensory processing from area 3b  to area  <dig>  and the ppc . therefore, the attenuations of p <dig>  and p <dig>  in the present study might indicate a hierarchical processing from area si to ppc of somatosensory input induced by water immersion.

the other possible explanation for the attenuation of p <dig> assumes that there is an effect from activity in the supplementary motor area  as well as the si. the sma does not appear to receive direct somatosensory input from the thalamus, but in monkeys it does receive projections from si, sii, and area  <dig>  some neurons in the sma respond to mechanical stimuli, such as light pressure or limb displacement  <cit> . furthermore, bodegard et al.  <cit>  used fmri in humans to show that light pressure to the index finger increased sma activation. additionally, a  <dig> ms positive potential was generated in a hand representation of the sma  <cit> . since afferent inputs are transmitted to the sma via si and the ppc  <cit> , the present results cannot rule out this possibility.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that water immersion modulates the short-latency seps known to originate in the si. we propose that attenuation of short-latency seps is caused by somatosensory inputs from water, and that water immersion influences the cortical processing of other somatosensory inputs.
