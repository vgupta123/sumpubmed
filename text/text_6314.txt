BACKGROUND
glutamate and glutamine are the first organic nitrogen compounds derived from the assimilation of nitrate and ammonium in plants. in the primary nitrogen assimilation pathway, nitrate taken up from the soil is reduced to nitrite and ammonium by nitrate and nitrite reductase, respectively. ammonium derived from nitrate or directly absorbed from the soil can be assimilated into glutamine and glutamate via the glutamine synthetase /glutamine-oxoglutarate aminotransferase  cycle . in addition to the primary nitrogen assimilation pathway, glutamate and glutamine can be synthesized via the remobilization of nitrogen-containing compounds and the assimilation of large amounts of ammonium generated by photorespiration in c <dig> plants  <cit> . thus, glutamate and glutamine are closely related in metabolism. besides glutamine, glutamate can be derived from other amino acids of the glutamate family such as arginine, ornithine, and proline in the plant cell  <cit> .

in addition to protein synthesis, glutamate has many important functions in plants. for instance, glutamate is a major amino donor for the synthesis of amino acids and other nitrogen-containing compounds in plants  <cit> . the α-amino group of glutamate can be transferred to a wide variety of α-keto acids to form amino acids, which are catalyzed by reversible pyridoxal-5′-phosphate-dependent aminotransferases. in addition to transamination reactions, glutamate can be directly converted to α-ketoglutarate, which is mainly catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase  in plants  <cit> . the active conversion between glutamate and α-ketoglutarate provides a direct link between nitrogen and carbon metabolism in the cell.

in addition to primary carbon and nitrogen metabolism, glutamate is required for the synthesis of glutathione , a linear tripeptide of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine and a major intracellular antioxidant in virtually all organisms  <cit> . glutamate is also a precursor for the synthesis of photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll. in addition, glutamate can be converted to γ-aminobutyrate  via glutamate decarboxylase . gaba is a non-protein amino acid that rapidly accumulates in response to biotic and abiotic stress to modulate plant growth . increasing evidence indicates that gaba may exert its effects in plants through the regulation of carbon metabolism as well as signaling pathways . glutamate also plays an important role in the synthesis of functional folate , which is a cofactor for one-carbon metabolism. folate is predominantly decorated with a polyglutamate tail. the addition of polyglutamate to folate may enhance its co-enzyme affinity, subcellular compartmentation and stability  <cit> .

in humans, glutamate and its metabolite gaba are important neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. glutamate mainly employs its action through glutamate receptors  <cit> , which also exist in non-neuronal tissues . thus, the functions of glutamate signaling may go beyond the nervous system . interestingly, plants also have glutamate receptor  homologs  <cit> . there are  <dig> glr genes grouped into three clades in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . the functions of these glrs have just begun to be elucidated. accumulating evidences suggest that plant glrs may not have ligand specificity  <cit> . for instance, atglr <dig>  is an ion channel gated by multiple hydrophobic amino acids but not glutamate  <cit> . thus, glrs may have evolved to have diverse functions in plants. nevertheless, the discovery of glr homologs has laid the foundation for the assessment of glutamate sensing and signaling in plants.

glutamate has been implicated to modulate calcium signaling  <cit>  and root system architecture  <cit> . glutamate inhibits primary root growth and stimulates the outgrowth of lateral roots near the primary root tip in arabidopsis  <cit> . this phenomenon is specific to glutamate, as structurally or metabolically related amino acids asp, gln, and d-glu do not have similar effects  <cit> . a recent study further demonstrated that a map kinase kinase kinase  is involved in glutamate signaling pathway responsible for inducing changes in arabidopsis root system architecture  <cit> . the map kinase cascade plays an important role in both biotic and abiotic stress signaling networks  <cit> . the identification of mekk <dig> in glutamate signaling raises an interesting question whether amino acid signaling interacts with biotic and abiotic stress signaling in plants. recently, exogenous glutamate  has been shown to induce systemic disease resistance in rice but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown  <cit> .

while glutamate has been shown to serve as an external signal to affect root growth and development in the most sensitive arabidopsis accession c <dig> at a very low concentration   <cit> , most studies on the effects of glutamate on the growth of seedlings or suspension cultures use 1–10 mm or even higher concentrations of glutamate  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that feeding of  <dig> or 40 mm glutamate to tobacco plants has limited effect on the endogenous glutamate pool  <cit> . feeding of 100 mm glutamate induces the expression of glutamate metabolic genes cytosolic glutamine synthetase  and glutamate dehydrogenase  in tobacco leaf discs  <cit> . together with studies on glutamate metabolism related enzymes using inhibitors, mutants, overexpression and antisense lines, it has been proposed that plants may have mechanisms to maintain glutamate homeostasis  <cit> . gs and gdh may be responsible for maintaining a constant concentration of glutamate in plants  <cit> .

amino acids have been shown to act as signals to regulate gene expression in yeast and animals  <cit> . it is somewhat surprising that relatively few studies have focused on the effects of exogenous amino acids on plant gene expression  <cit> . we have previously shown that glutamine can effectively support rice seedling growth when supplemented as the sole nitrogen source in hydroponics  <cit> . in addition to its role in plant nutrition, glutamine can rapidly induce the expression of key transcription factor genes involved in nitrogen and stress responses in rice roots  <cit> . these findings support the notion that amino acid signaling pathways may crosstalk with biotic and abiotic signaling networks in plants. although glutamate and glutamine are closely related in structure and metabolism, these two amino acids may have distinct signaling effects. here, we examined the nutritional effects of glutamate on rice seedlings. we also used transcriptome analysis to identify genes that were rapidly induced by glutamate in rice roots. some of the early glutamate-responsive genes identified here may be involved in glutamate signaling in plants.

RESULTS
exogenous glutamate can support rice seedling growth
glutamate occupies a central position in plant metabolism and serves as a precursor for many important compounds . to examine the nutritional effect of glutamate, we grew rice seedlings in hydroponics supplemented with different concentrations of glutamate as the sole nitrogen source . feeding of  <dig>  mm glutamate did not significantly  improve the growth of rice seedlings , and the chlorophyll content only increased slightly  as compared with those of seedlings grown in the absence of nitrogen. the shoot length of rice seedlings grown in  <dig>  and 1 mm glutamate was significantly longer than that grown in the absence of nitrogen, but was still shorter than that grown in  <dig>  mm nh4no <dig> . supplementation of  <dig> ,  <dig>  or 10 mm glutamate in the hydroponics inhibited shoot growth as compared with that of  <dig>  or 1 mm glutamate . the root length of rice seedlings grown in  <dig>  mm glutamate was similar to that of seedlings grown in the absence of nitrogen . feeding of  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  or 10 mm glutamate in the hydroponics increasingly inhibited root growth as compared with that of  <dig>  mm nh4no <dig> . although glutamate was not as effective as ammonium nitrate in supporting rice seedling growth, the chlorophyll content in seedlings grown in  <dig> -10 mm glutamate was comparable to that of seedlings grown in  <dig>  mm nh4no <dig> .fig.  <dig> glutamate as a nitrogen nutrient to support rice seedling growth. a rice seedlings grown in hydroponics containing nh4no <dig> or glutamate as the nitrogen source. shoot length, root length , and chlorophyll contents  of rice seedlings from . the rice seedlings are 17-day-old. data are means ± sd . different letters indicate significant differences between treatments, tested by one-way anova followed by tukey’s test . +n, +  <dig>  mm nh4no3; −n, no nitrogen




slow uptake of glutamate in nitrogen-starved rice seedlings
to examine if rice seedlings could effectively take up glutamate, 17-day-old nitrogen-starved rice seedlings were transferred to hydroponics containing  <dig>  mm glutamate for 0–24 h. the content of glutamate left in the growth medium was measured during the time course of glutamate feeding. the amount of glutamate left in the growth medium only decreased slightly after  <dig> -8 h of treatment . approximately 20% and 50% of the glutamate supplemented in the hydroponics were consumed after 16 h and 24 h of treatment, respectively .fig.  <dig> amino acid contents in the growth medium and rice roots during the time course of glutamate treatment. 17-day-old nitrogen-starved rice seedlings were transferred to hydroponics containing  <dig>  mm glutamate for 24 h. a the contents of glutamate left in the hydroponics were measured over the 24-h time course. b contents of glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, alanine, serine, and asparagine in the roots were measured during the time course of glutamate treatment. fold change indicates the relative amounts of amino acids in  <dig>  mm glutamate-treated roots  compared to those of control . data are means ± sd . different letters indicate significant differences between treatments, tested by one-way anova followed by tukey’s test 




glutamate is rapidly converted to other amino acids in the roots
after taken up by the nitrogen-starved rice seedlings, glutamate may be converted to other nitrogen-containing compounds. we analyzed the levels of free amino acids in the roots during the time course of glutamate treatment. the levels of glutamate, aspartate, serine, glutamine, asparagine, and alanine increased significantly  after 24 h of glutamate treatment as compared to the untreated control . by contrast, the amounts of the other proteinogenic amino acids did not change significantly . interestingly, feeding of glutamate to nitrogen-starved rice seedlings did not significantly increase the endogenous levels of glutamate within 30 min . glutamate in the roots started to accumulate to a higher level after feeding for 1 h and increased to about  <dig> -fold of control levels after 4 h of glutamate treatment . although the exogenous amount of glutamate in the growth medium decreased significantly after 8–24 h , the endogenous levels of glutamate in the roots did not further increase after 8–24 h of glutamate treatment . these results suggest that the glutamate taken up by the rice seedlings may be constantly converted to the other nitrogen-containing compounds in the roots.

the amount of glutamine, aspartate and alanine increased rapidly after 15 min of glutamate treatment . feeding of glutamate to nitrogen-starved rice seedlings significantly increased the endogenous levels of glutamine after 15–30 min . the amount of glutamine in the roots increased to about 3-fold after 1 h, ~5-fold after 4 h, and continued to increase to ~10-fold of control levels after 8–24 h of glutamate treatment . similar trend was observed in changes of alanine levels during the time course of glutamate treatment. the amount of alanine increased to about  <dig> - to 3-fold after 4–8 h, and continued to increase to ~8-fold of control levels after 16–24 h of glutamate treatment . feeding of glutamate to nitrogen-starved rice seedlings rapidly enhanced the accumulation of aspartate within the first hour, and the levels of aspartate increased to about 2- to  <dig> -fold of control levels after 4–24 h of glutamate treatment .

by contrast, feeding of glutamate to nitrogen-starved rice seedlings did not significantly increase the amount of serine in the roots within the first 4 h . the levels of serine increased to about 2- to 3-fold of control levels after 8–24 h of glutamate treatment . the amount of asparagine was low in nitrogen-starved seedlings, and feeding of glutamate for  <dig> -4 h did not significantly increase the levels of asparagine in the roots . the amount of asparagine started to increase significantly  after 8 h of glutamate treatment, and continued to increase to ~16-fold after 16 h, and ~20-fold of control levels after 24 h .

identification of early glutamate-responsive genes in rice seedlings
in addition to nutritional effects, we attempted to explore the signaling role of glutamate in the regulation of gene expression in rice. to identify genes that were rapidly induced by glutamate, we used microarray analysis to compare the gene expression profiles between rice seedlings treated with  <dig>  mm glutamate for 30 min and the untreated control. analysis of the microarray data with 2-fold cutoff revealed that the expression of  <dig> genes was rapidly regulated by glutamate in the roots. of the  <dig> genes, including  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated, we were able to confirm the up-regulation of  <dig> genes , and none of the down-regulated genes could be verified by qrt-pcr . in contrast to roots, the microarray data did not identify any genes that were rapidly induced by glutamate in the shoots . this is consistent with the finding that levels of free amino acids did not change significantly  in the shoots after 30 min of glutamate treatment . unexpectedly, the treatment also did not significantly increase the levels of glutamate in the roots, while the amounts of glutamine, aspartate, and alanine increased slightly .table  <dig> list of early glutamate-responsive genes in rice roots

total rna extracted from 17-day-old rice seedlings grown in hydroponic solution without nitrogen  or treated with  <dig>  mm glutamate for 30 min  was used for microarray analysis. aindicates genes that are also rapidly induced by glutamine  <cit> . the results were derived from two biological replicates




we used gene ontology  category enrichment analysis to classify the biological functions of  <dig> genes up-regulated by glutamate in rice roots. in biological process, the go terms “metal ion transport”, “protein amino acid phosphorylation”, and “amine metabolic process” were significantly  enriched . in cellular component, the go term “membrane” was enriched . in molecular function, the go terms “hydrolase activity”, “protein kinase activity”, “active transmembrane transporter activity”, “cation transmembrane transporter activity”, “atp binding” and “calcium ion binding” were significantly enriched . some of the glutamate up-regulated genes in representative functional categories were listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> gene ontology enrichment analysis of genes up-regulated by glutamate. the differentially expressed genes were analyzed by singular enrichment analysis using agrigo. significantly enriched go categories in biological process , cellular component , and molecular function  are shown in yellow, orange, and red boxes . each box contains go term number, the fdr value, go term, and number associated with the go term in the query list and glutamate up-regulated genes  as well as total number of query list and reference background . the go terms “primary metabolic process”, “transporter activity” and “protein kinase activity” are significantly enriched in glutamate-responsive genes




in addition, we also performed kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  analysis. of the  <dig> up-regulated genes,  <dig> genes were annotated with kegg orthology  terms. a list of these genes, the associated ko number and kegg pathways were shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  we further performed kegg pathway enrichment analysis and the result indicated that “glycerophospholipid metabolism” and “abc transporters” were enriched . since the gene count was very low,  <dig> in “glycerophospholipid metabolism” and only  <dig> in “abc transporters”, the result of kegg pathway enrichment analysis might not be meaningful. nevertheless, the results of go and kegg analyses suggest that glutamate feeding for 30 min can rapidly trigger the expression of genes involved in metabolism, transport and signaling in rice roots.

the functions of the early glutamate-responsive genes are very diverse. of the  <dig> genes identified, at least  <dig> genes encode putative transcription factors. the os07g <dig> gene encodes a homolog of arabidopsis lbd <dig> that is involved in the regulation of nitrogen response  <cit> . cigr <dig> , an elicitor-responsive gene, encodes a gras family protein that has been shown to suppress cell death in rice  <cit> . nac <dig> , no apical meristem protein  <dig>  is involved in abiotic stress responses . the expression of os04g <dig>  is rapidly induced by jasmonate, and thus has been named rerj <dig> . the other glutamate-responsive transcription factor genes include os09g <dig> , os01g <dig> , os02g <dig> , os11g <dig> , os09g <dig> , os07g <dig> , and os08g <dig> .

the expression of os03g <dig>  and os04g <dig>  was rapidly induced by glutamate . the enzymes encoded by these two genes are directly involved in glutamate metabolism. in addition to genes related to metabolism and transport, many genes involved in signal transduction, growth regulation, defense and stress responses were also rapidly induced by glutamate . for instance, the expression of several genes encoding kinases, phosphatases, and calcium signaling related proteins was rapidly induced by glutamate . the cell wall associated kinases  may serve as pectin receptors to regulate plant growth and stress responses  <cit> . interestingly, glutamate rapidly induced the expression of several wak genes . the indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase osgh <dig>  functioning in auxin-dependent development can promote salicylate- and jasmonate-independent basal immunity in rice  <cit> . the expression of osgh <dig>   was rapidly and strongly induced by different concentrations of glutamate . several defense-related genes such as herbivore induced 13-lipoxygenase , chitinase  <dig>  and  <dig>  were also rapidly induced by glutamate .

regulation of early glutamate-responsive genes by different concentrations of glutamate
to verify the microarray data, total rna extracted from 17-day-old rice seedlings treated with 0–5 mm glutamate for 30 min was used for qrt-pcr analysis. we were able to confirm that glutamate  could induce the expression of  <dig> genes for more than 2-fold as compared to the untreated control. the effects of different concentrations of glutamate on the expression of these genes are shown in fig.  <dig> and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  in addition to verifying the microarray data, the results could also reveal the sensitivity and dosage dependence of these genes to glutamate. for instance, the expression of os09g <dig> , os04g <dig>  and os02g <dig>  was very sensitive to glutamate as treatment of  <dig>  mm glutamate for 30 min resulted in greater than 5-fold induction in these genes as compared to the untreated control . the other genes that are sensitive to glutamate induction include os03g <dig> , os01g <dig> , os12g <dig> , os02g <dig> , os07g <dig> , os01g <dig> , os11g <dig> , os02g <dig> , and os09g <dig> . the expression of these genes was strongly induced by  <dig>  mm glutamate and stayed at high levels  or continued to increase when treated with higher concentrations of glutamate as compared to the untreated control .fig.  <dig> regulation of glutamate-responsive transcription factor genes by different concentrations of glutamate. 17-day-old nitrogen-starved rice seedlings were transferred to hydroponics containing  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and 5 mm glutamate for 30 min. total rna extracted from roots was used for qrt-pcr to analyze the expression of  <dig> glutamate-responsive transcription factor genes. the number of each gene corresponds to the number in table  <dig>  relative expression indicates the fold-change of each gene as compared to that of control




regulation of glutamate-responsive transcription factor genes by different nitrogen
to further examine if the response was specific to glutamate, we compared the effects of glutamate, glutamine, and ammonium nitrate on the expression of  <dig> glutamate-responsive transcription factor genes. total rna extracted from nitrogen-starved rice seedlings treated with  <dig>  mm glutamate, glutamine, or  <dig>  mm ammonium nitrate for 15 min to 24 h was used for qrt-pcr analysis. the results revealed that glutamine and ammonium nitrate could rapidly induce the expression of many glutamate-responsive transcription factor genes in the roots . among these transcription factor genes, the expression of bhlh <dig>  was rapidly and strongly induced by glutamate  but was not or only slightly induced by glutamine and ammonium nitrate . the expression of myb , bhlh <dig>  and nac <dig>  was preferentially induced by glutamate within 15–30 min of treatments . by contrast, the expression of another myb  was rapidly and preferentially induced by ammonium nitrate . the expression of cigr <dig>  was strongly induced by ammonium nitrate after treatment for 30 min . although the expression of nac <dig>  and wrky <dig>  was induced by all nitrogen treatments, ammonium nitrate seemed to have stronger effects on the induction of these genes . while ammonium nitrate had little effect on the induction of erf <dig> , glutamate and glutamine rapidly and strongly induced the expression of erf <dig> . the expression of hec <dig>  and lbd <dig>  was preferentially induced by glutamine .fig.  <dig> effects of glutamine and nh4no <dig> on the expression of glutamate-responsive transcription factor genes bhlh <dig>  myb , bhlh <dig>  nac <dig> , myb , cigr <dig>  nac <dig>  wrky <dig> , erf <dig>  ﻿hec <dig> and lbd <dig> . 17-day-old nitrogen-starved rice seedlings were transferred to hydroponics containing  <dig>  mm glutamate, glutamine, or  <dig>  mm nh4no <dig> for  <dig>  15 min, 30 min,  <dig>   <dig>  and 24 h. total rna extracted from roots was used for qrt-pcr to analyze the expression of  <dig> glutamate-responsive transcription factor genes. the number of each gene corresponds to the number in table  <dig>  relative expression indicates the fold-change of each gene as compared to that of control




identification of genes that are specifically induced by glutamate
the discovery that the expression of bhlh <dig> , myb , bhlh <dig>  and nac <dig>  was specifically or preferentially induced by glutamate prompted us to examine the expression of the other  <dig> glutamate-responsive genes under glutamate, glutamine and ammonium nitrate time course treatments. the expression of many glutamate-responsive genes was also rapidly induced by glutamine and ammonium nitrate as compared with that of nitrogen-starved rice seedlings . however, the expression patterns and the amounts of transcripts accumulated in response to different nitrogen sources varied from gene to gene. of the additional  <dig> genes examined, the expression of at least  <dig> genes was strongly and preferentially induced by glutamate . interestingly, except the unknown function genes, most of the genes preferentially induced by glutamate, e.g. os08g <dig> , os01g <dig> , os10g <dig> , os09g <dig> , os03g <dig> , os12g <dig> , are related to signal transduction or defense responses .fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr analyses of genes that are specifically or preferentially induced by glutamate. 17-day-old rice seedlings grown in hydroponics without nitrogen were subsequently transferred to medium containing  <dig>  mm glutamate, glutamine, or  <dig>  mm nh4no <dig> for  <dig>  15 min, 30 min,  <dig>   <dig>  and 24 h. total rna extracted from roots was used for qrt-pcr to analyze the expression of os08g <dig> , os01g <dig> , os10g <dig> , os09g <dig> , os03g <dig> , os12g <dig>  , os12g <dig> , os01g <dig>  , and four unknown function genes os04g <dig>  os01g <dig>  os03g <dig> and os12g <dig> . the number of each gene corresponds to the number in table  <dig>  relative expression indicates the fold-change of each gene as compared to that of control




the expression of os12g <dig>  and os01g <dig>  was rapidly and preferentially induced by glutamate . the functions of these two genes are related to transport and secretion. the expression of at least  <dig> unknown function genes, e.g. os04g <dig>  os01g <dig>  os03g <dig> and os12g <dig>  was specifically or preferentially induced by glutamate .

glutamate rapidly induces the expression of gdc1
it is interesting that the expression of os03g <dig>  has the strongest induction  by glutamate in the microarray analysis . treatment of different concentrations of glutamate  revealed that the expression of gdc <dig> was very sensitive to glutamate as treatment of  <dig>  mm glutamate already significantly induced the expression of gdc <dig>  as compared to the untreated control in the roots . furthermore, the effect of glutamate on the induction of gdc <dig> is dosage dependent, e.g. the induction is stronger as the concentration of glutamate increases . in addition, the results of glutamate time course treatments revealed that glutamate rapidly and strongly induced the expression of gdc <dig> . the amount of gdc <dig> transcripts increased approximately 20– <dig> folds after  <dig> -1 h of  <dig>  mm glutamate treatment as compared to the levels of the untreated control . the function of gdc is to convert glutamate to gaba. to further examine if the induction of gdc <dig> might contribute to the accumulation of gaba, we measured the amount of gaba in the seedlings during the time course of glutamate treatment. in contrast to the rapid induction of the gdc <dig> gene, the content of gaba did not increase significantly after  <dig>  to 8 h of glutamate treatments as compared to the levels of the untreated control in the roots. the amount of gaba increased significantly  until  <dig> to 24 h of glutamate treatments .fig.  <dig> effects of glutamate on the expression of gdc <dig> and accumulation of gaba. qrt-pcr analysis of gdc <dig> from roots of 17-day-old rice seedlings treated with different concentrations of glutamate for 30 min , or treated with  <dig>  mm glutamate for  <dig> -24 h . relative expression indicates the fold-change of each gene as compared to that of control. c the amounts of gaba in the roots. 17-day-old nitrogen-starved rice seedlings were transferred to hydroponics containing  <dig>  mm glutamate for 24 h. the amounts of gaba in the roots were measured during the time course of glutamate treatments. fold change indicates the relative amount of gaba compared to that of control . data are means ± sd . different letters indicate significant differences between treatments, tested by one-way anova followed by tukey’s test 




discussion
nutritional effect of glutamate on rice
although glutamate and glutamine are closely related, exogenous glutamine appears to be more effective than glutamate in supporting rice seedling growth. we previously showed that supplementation of  <dig>  mm glutamine could significantly improve the growth of rice seedlings in hydroponics  <cit> . here, we demonstrated that feeding of  <dig>  mm glutamate had little effect and supplementation of  <dig>  mm glutamate could significantly enhance rice seedling growth comparable to that of  <dig>  mm glutamine   <cit> . the optimal concentration of exogenous glutamate to support rice seedling growth is around  <dig> -1 mm. when the supplemented glutamate exceeds this amount, the excess glutamate will inhibit the growth of rice seedlings. together, these results support the notion that glutamate can serve as a nitrogen nutrient, but it is not as effective as ammonium nitrate or glutamine.

as leaf nitrogen content and chlorophyll concentration are closely linked, the level of leaf chlorophyll is commonly used as an indicator of endogenous nitrogen status. the chlorophyll contents in rice seedlings grown in  <dig> -10 mm glutamate were similar to those grown in ammonium nitrate. these results suggest that the rice seedlings grown in  <dig> -10 mm glutamate can efficiently synthesize chlorophylls and do not have symptoms of nitrogen deficiency. thus, the inhibitory effects of  <dig> -10 mm glutamate on the growth of rice seedling are likely caused by over nutrition or glutamate toxicity, rather than nitrogen deficiency.

we previously showed that glutamine could be rapidly taken up by nitrogen-starved rice seedlings and was almost used up in hydroponics after 24 h of feeding  <cit> . here, we performed a similar experiment and found that nitrogen-starved rice seedlings could not consume glutamate as effectively as glutamine. after feeding of glutamate to nitrogen-starved rice seedlings for 24 h, approximately 50% of the supplemented glutamate was still left in the growth medium . these results suggest that rice seedlings may have different mechanisms to absorb glutamine and glutamate. in arabidopsis, four amino acid transporters, e.g. aap <dig>  aap <dig>  prot <dig>  and lht <dig>  have been shown to play a role in amino acid uptake by the root  <cit> . by contrast, amino acid transporters have been rarely studied in monocots  <cit> . recently, analysis of rice amino acid permeases reveals that osaap <dig>  osaap <dig> and osaap <dig> function as general amino acid permeases and transport all amino acids well except aspartate and β-alanine, whereas osaap <dig> has a distinct substrate specificity that prefers neutral and basic amino acids  <cit> . interestingly, these rice aaps all have better specificity to glutamine than glutamate  <cit> . it is likely that rice roots may have a more efficient transport system to take up glutamine than glutamate, which is consistent with our hydroponic feeding results.

glutamate homeostasis in rice seedlings
glutamate is the most abundant free amino acid in nitrogen-starved rice seedlings . interestingly, feeding of  <dig>  mm glutamate to nitrogen-starved rice seedlings did not significantly increase the amount of endogenous glutamate within the first hour. the glutamate content increased to approximately  <dig> -fold of control after 4–24 h of feeding, which are relatively small as compared to those of glutamine  and gaba , two nitrogen-containing compounds directly linked to glutamate metabolism. asparagine is a relative inert amino acid. levels of asparagine increased to ~ 20-fold of control after 24 h of glutamate feeding. asparagine and glutamine have high nitrogen to carbon ratios that play important roles in nitrogen storage and transport in plants. the accumulation of these amino acids indicates that the rice seedlings are not deficient of nitrogen after several hours of glutamate feeding.

we previously showed that feeding of glutamine to nitrogen-starved rice seedlings resulted in rapid and dramatic accumulation of glutamine, but not glutamate, in the roots  <cit> . here, we demonstrated that feeding of glutamate also resulted in dramatic increases of glutamine, but not glutamate. these results suggest that glutamate, a very active amino acid, either directly absorbed from the environment or derived from glutamine, will be quickly metabolized to other nitrogen-containing compounds in plants. in addition to its critical role in metabolism, glutamate may also function as a signaling molecule to regulate plant growth and development. thus, it is important for plants to maintain the homeostasis of glutamate as dramatic fluctuations of glutamate may have detrimental effects on plant metabolism, growth and development. it is not clear how plants maintain the homeostasis of glutamate. the rapid induction of glutamate metabolic genes such as gdc <dig>  and gdh <dig>  observed in this study may represent one of the strategies to maintain glutamate homeostasis. still, other mechanisms involved in the regulation of glutamate homeostasis have yet to be uncovered in plants.

glutamate can trigger an elicitor-like response in plants
it is unexpected that many genes related to defense responses are rapidly induced by glutamate. for instance, the elicitor-responsive gene cigr <dig> encodes a transcriptional activator that is involved in hypersensitive response during pathogen infection  <cit> . the ja responsive gene bhlh <dig>  is involved in disease resistance and drought tolerance  <cit> . herbivore-induced 13-lipoxygenase  has been demonstrated to be involved in defense response  <cit> . the indole-3-acetic acid–amido synthetase gh <dig>  is involved in salicylate- and jasmonate-independent basal immunity in rice  <cit> . several wall-associated kinases are involved in basal defense against rice blast fungus  <cit> . glutamate rapidly induced the expression of cigr <dig>  oshi-lox, osgh <dig> , waks and defense-related genes encoding trypsin inhibitor, xylanase inhibitor, aspartic proteinase, subtilisin-like protease, chitinase, and disease-related receptor-like protein kinases . glutamate also rapidly induced the expression of stress-related genes encoding late embryogenesis abundant  protein, e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase, heavy metal transport domain-containing protein, mate efflux protein, phytocyanin, and glycosyl hydrolase . the rapid induction of these defense- and stress-related genes suggests that glutamate may trigger an elicitor-like response in rice seedlings.

interestingly, exogenous glutamate has been shown to induce systemic disease resistance in rice  <cit> . it is conceivable that glutamate may have a role similar to an elicitor or the exogenous glutamate may affect the cell wall and triggers an elicitor-like response in the plant cell. glutamate or changes in the cell wall caused by exogenous glutamate may be perceived by receptor or sensor proteins located on the cell surface, which in turn transmit the signal to the nucleus to regulate the expression of defense-related genes. alternatively, the endogenous glutamate or metabolites derived from glutamate may be directly involved in the regulation of defense-related genes.

in addition to defense and stress-related genes, glutamate also rapidly induced the expression of genes involved in metabolism, transport, growth and signal transduction.

some of the early glutamate-responsive genes encode membrane/wall receptors, transporters, calcium signaling proteins, protein kinases/phosphatases, and transcription factors , which may be involved in glutamate sensing and signaling in rice roots. although the expression of glutamate receptor genes is not rapidly induced by glutamate , we cannot exclude the possibility that the glutamate signaling pathways are mediated by glrs to regulate gene expression in rice roots. still, glutamate may employ its signaling functions through glr independent pathways. some of the early glutamate-responsive genes identified in this study may be involved in the glr dependent or independent pathways.

interactions between glutamate and glutamine signaling pathways
glutamate and glutamine are closely related in structure and metabolism. although glutamine is more effective in serving as a nitrogen nutrient, glutamate has more profound effects on the regulation of gene expression in rice seedlings. glutamine rapidly induces the expression of ~ <dig> genes  <cit> , whereas glutamate induces the expression of at least  <dig> genes in rice roots. some of the glutamate-induced genes are specifically related to glutamate metabolism and transport. for instance, the expression of gdh <dig> and several transporter genes is induced by glutamate . glutamine induces the expression of glutamine dumper genes  <cit> , which are not induced by glutamate. an unexpected common theme is that both glutamate and glutamine rapidly induce the expression of stress response genes. glutamate, in particular, affects more genes related to defense function. further studies on this newly emerging theme, e.g. amino acids and defense response, promise to provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of amino acid signaling in plants.

still, the microarray data revealed that glutamate and glutamine commonly induced the expression of  <dig> genes . most of the commonly induced genes are not directly involved in metabolism. interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> commonly induced genes encode putative transcription factors, e.g. bhlh <dig> , myb , nac <dig> , lbd37-like , and wrky <dig> . it is possible that glutamate and glutamine may share some components in the signaling pathways to regulate plant growth and stress responses. alternatively, some of the glutamate effects may be indirectly caused by glutamine as treatment of exogenous glutamate rapidly and significantly increases the amount of endogenous glutamine. nevertheless, we have identified several genes that are specifically or preferentially induced by glutamate . these genes can be used to dissect the molecular mechanism of glutamate signaling and regulation of gene expression in the future.

significance of exogenous glutamate treatment
nitrate and ammonium have been considered as the dominant nitrogen sources for plants and research on plant nitrogen nutrition has thus heavily focused on these inorganic nitrogen forms. one of the reasons that drives many researchers to study the effects of nitrate and ammonium on plants is the use of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture. in fact, organic and inorganic nitrogen sources coexist in the ecosystem, and plants can use a diverse array of nitrogen forms, including amino acids, present in the soil  <cit> . it has been shown that arabidopsis roots can take up amino acids at naturally occurring concentrations from agricultural soil  <cit> . under natural conditions, decomposing organic matters including plant and animal tissues may result in organic nitrogen-rich patches in the soil. although glutamate concentrations are normally low  in bulk soil solutions  <cit> , high concentrations of glutamate may routinely occur in organic nitrogen-rich patches as plant and animal tissues contain free glutamate at millimolar levels  <cit> . the concentrations of apoplastic glutamate has been reported in the range of  <dig> - <dig>  mm in a variety of tissues and plant species . interestingly, some of the glutamate-responsive genes identified here can be rapidly induced  by exogenous glutamate at a relatively low concentration . these results suggest that the signaling role of glutamate in the regulation of gene expression may occur in planta.

CONCLUSIONS
glutamate is a very active amino acid that occupies a central position in the primary metabolism in plants. here, we show that glutamate, the most abundant amino acid in nitrogen-starved rice seedlings, may play a role in plant nutrition and function as a signaling molecule to regulate gene expression. in addition to genes involved in metabolism, transport, growth and signal transduction, glutamate rapidly induces the expression of genes related defense and stress responses. the elicitor-like response triggered by glutamate may partly explain the effect of exogenous glutamate on the induction of disease resistance in rice. the nutritional effects and the diverse functions of early glutamate-responsive genes support the notion that glutamate is an important metabolic fuel and a functional amino acid in plants.
