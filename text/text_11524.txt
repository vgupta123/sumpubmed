BACKGROUND
plant non-specific lipid transfer proteins  assemble an ubiquitous family of small cationic proteins subdivided into two families with molecular masses of ~9- <dig> kda  and ~ <dig> kda . a biological role of these proteins in plants is still a matter of discussion, although they are proposed to be involved in angiosperms fertilization, adhesion of pollen, somatic embryogenesis, lipid metabolism, formation of the cuticle, cell death, plant signaling and protection of plants against biotic and abiotic stresses . some lipid transfer proteins, for example osltpl <dig> in rice, were shown to be essential for seed development  <cit> . a number of ltps exhibit antimicrobial and antiviral properties, as well as antiproliferative activity against tumor cells in vitro  <cit> . recently, the lipid transfer protein displaying antinociceptive activity was isolated from noni  seeds  <cit> .

ltp genes occur in all land plants from the most primitive liverworts and mosses to tracheophytes, but were not found in lower plants such as algae. in this regard, it is suggested today that ltps have been upraised in plants after their transition from water to land, i.e. about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . these proteins are encoded by large gene families, and it is believed that the genes of multiple ltp isoforms performing different functions during evolution have been introduced by a number of successive duplications of the ancestral gene with subsequent mutations. diversification of isoform functions is a powerful tool of plant defense system. for example, it is known, that substitution of a single amino acid residue in the mature protein sequence resulted in substantially different antifungal profile  <cit> .

many ltp1s manifest oneself as important food pollen and latex allergens responsible for allergic reactions. structural, functional, and immunological studies of novel plant ltps deepen our knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms of their antimicrobial action, lipid-binding activity, and allergenicity and open the door to practical application of ltps in medicine and agriculture. it is worth emphasizing that modern diagnostic kits as well as effective vaccines for allergen-specific immunotherapy can be developed on the basis of natural and recombinant plant ltps and used as a means to reduce immune reactivity and prevent allergic reactions.

the fabaceae leguminosae, or papilionaceae, better known as the legume, bean, or pea family, is the third largest family of angiosperms after orchidaceae  and asteraceae , and the second one after poaceae  in terms of agricultural and economic importance. today legumes are an increasingly invaluable food source which is widely distributed around the world due to its high nutritional benefit and unpretentiousness to the cultivation conditions. however, legumes are often cause different allergic reactions. for example, among spanish children younger than  <dig> years old, sensitization to legumes such as pea, bean, lentil, and chickpea has the fifth frequency of food allergy occurrence  <cit> . legume allergy is also prevalent in asian countries, particularly in india, where chickpea is a major food allergen  <cit> . so far, several ltp <dig> allergens were isolated from the fabaceae: ara h  <dig>  ara h  <dig>  and ara h  <dig> from the peanut arachis hypogaea  <cit> , len c  <dig> from the lentil lens culinaris  <cit> , and pha v  <dig> from the bean phaseolus vulgaris  <cit> . by now two allergens were isolated from the garden pea and registered in the who/iuis allergen nomenclature sub-committee database : pis s  <dig>  and pis s  <dig> . in this paper we report isolation, recombinant expression, solution structure, antifungal activity, lipid binding, and allergenic properties of a novel ltp from the garden pea pisum sativum.

RESULTS
isolation and characterization of a novel pea ltp
a novel lipid transfer protein was isolated from the pea pisum sativum seeds. due to the high stability of ltps a heat treatment of the crude extract was used in order to precipitate high molecular mass proteins. sequential ultrafiltration, cation exchange chromatography, and rp-hplc were used to purify the protein . maldi-tof-ms analysis of the obtained fractions revealed the presence of a protein with molecular mass of  <dig>  da . n-terminal amino acid microsequencing of the purified protein, designated as ps-ltp <dig>  revealed the sequence alsХgtvsadmapХvtylqa- having significant homology with that of ltp <dig> subfamily along with similarity of their cd spectra . reduction of ps-ltp <dig> in the presence of dtt and subsequent alkylation with iodoacetamide resulted in the molecular mass increase by  <dig> da . alkylation of the purified protein without prior reduction did not lead to any molecular mass changes . these results demonstrated that ps-ltp <dig> contained  <dig> cysteine residues forming  <dig> disulfide bonds. a yield of the ps-ltp <dig> came up to  <dig> mg per  <dig> g of the pea seeds.

rt-pcr cloning, and sequencing of the pea ltp precursors cdnas
by means of race strategy two full-length cdnas  and a partial cdna  encoding the precursors of novel pea ltp1s were determined. three nucleotide sequences  include 357- <dig> bp open reading frames encoding the protein precursors of 119- <dig> amino acid residues  long. the sequence analysis was carried out on the signalp_v <dig>   web server and showed the most probable borders between the signal sequences and the mature proteins. the precursors of three novel pea ltps include 24– <dig> a.a. signal peptides and  <dig> a.a. mature proteins, containing  <dig> conservative cysteine residues each .fig.  <dig> amino acid sequences of novel pea ltps and pru p  <dig>  the conserved residues across all sequences are highlighted in cyan. the residues participating in lipid-binding are marked with a triangles  <cit> . the residues forming the conformational epitope of pru p  <dig> are boxed in dark blue. the residues of pru p  <dig> crucial for ige-binding are asterisked. i% – percentage of sequence identity



tissue-specific gene expression analysis by quantitative real-time rt-pcr
gene expression profiles of the ps-ltp1- <dig> isoforms in different pea organs were studied using real-time rt-pcr. melting-curve analysis confirmed that the primer pairs for pcr amplification of ps-ltp1- <dig> and β-tubulin fragments were specific. amplification rate for each primer pair was evaluated on the basis of a linear regression slope of a dilution row . relative expression software tool  was used for group-wise comparison and statistical analysis of relative expression results of real-time rt-pcr experiments. rest-mcs was picked out of the several software versions as it allowed to compare up to six conditions of interest with one reference condition for up to ten samples per group. the mrna levels in different tissue samples were calculated for each gene relatively to its expression in control pea dry seeds before germination .fig.  <dig> differential expression profiles of the ps-ltp1- <dig> genes in various pea organs. all expression values are normalized to the reference mean of the β-tubulin gene expression. the mrna levels in different tissue samples were calculated for each gene relatively to its expression in control pea dry seeds before germination



based on the obtained experimental data the ps-ltp <dig> gene exhibited high expression level in dry seeds that sharply decreased after germination. apparently, the protein fulfils its biological role before germination at very early seedling stages. in contrast, expression levels of the ps-ltp <dig> and ps-ltp <dig> genes increased sharply after germination and remained the same at all tested organs of mature pea plants.

molecular characterization of ps-ltp1
the calculated molecular mass of the mature oxidized ps-ltp <dig>  differs by  <dig> da from the protein m/z  measured by maldi-tof-ms which coincides with the absence of the c-terminal phenylalanine residue. to confirm this suggestion a tryptic digestion of the reduced ps-ltp <dig> was performed. the protein trypsinolysis resulted in  <dig> peptide fragments . molecular masses of the fragments were calculated with peptidemass tool on the expasy online-server . the calculated values matched well with the measured m/z by maldi-tof-ms . the c-terminal fragments containing phenylalanine residue were not found. the structures of the obtained fragments were confirmed by maldi-lift-tof/tof-ms microsequencing . as a result the complete amino acid sequence of ps-ltp <dig> was determined. the primary structure of ps-ltp <dig> corresponded to a translated nucleotide sequence of the mature protein without the c-terminal phenylalanine residue . due to the fact that all the purification stages were carried out under ice-cold conditions in the presence of protease inhibitors, it was concluded that an enzymatic cleavage of the c-terminal phenylalanine residue occurred directly in the plant cells. it should be mentioned that two ltp isoforms without c-terminal phenylalanine residues were found earlier in the lentil germinated seeds  <cit> .

heterologous expression, purification, and characterization of the recombinant ps-ltp <dig> and its 13c, 15n-labeled analogue
e. coli bl <dig>  star™ cells were transformed by pet-his8-trxl-ps-ltp <dig> plasmid containing thioredoxin a  as a carrier protein. a single met residue in ps-ltp <dig> sequence was replaced with leu in order to prevent the target protein cleavage by cnbr. it was shown that met/leu substitution did not affect the protein structure  <cit> . the recombinant ps-ltp <dig> and its 13c,15n-labeled analogue were overexpressed in e. coli. decrease of the induction temperature to 26– <dig> °c resulted in increasing levels of the target fusion proteins in a soluble form. the yields of the recombinant ps-ltp <dig> and its 13c,15n-labeled analogue amounted to  <dig> and  <dig>  mg/l of the bacterial culture, respectively.

cd spectra of the recombinant unlabeled and 13c,15n-labeled proteins were similar to the cd spectrum of native ps-ltp <dig>  antimicrobial activity test and antibody binding assay did not reveal any behavior differences between native  and recombinant  forms of the ps-ltp <dig> 

biological activity of ps-ltp1
an ability of the recombinant ps-ltp <dig> to interact with different lipids was estimated using the tns fluorescent probe. saturated and unsaturated fatty acids  jasmonic acid , and lysolipids were used as test compounds. it is known that a fluorescence of tns rises sharply upon binding with a hydrophobic cavity of a protein  <cit> . no significant interaction between the tested lipids and tns was detected. it was shown that ps-ltp <dig> bound all the tested lipids with different efficiencies , as well as the tns lipophilic probe. when ps-ltp <dig> was added to the mixture of tns and a lipid, the last one was able to compete with tns for binding to the protein. it was observed that unsaturated fas displaced the tns with the higher efficiency than saturated fas. linoleic  and linolenic  acids competed with tns most effectively, both leading to  <dig> % of the initial tns fluorescence. at the same time, stearic  and margaric  acids displaced the tns probe with the lowest efficiencies . despite a relatively small size of the molecule, ja displaced tns with moderate efficiency . lysolipids competed with tns with high efficiencies, especially negatively charged lmpg  and lppg , leading to  <dig> and  <dig> % of the control fluorescence, respectively. according to the obtained data pru p  <dig> can bind a broad spectrum of saturated and unsaturated fa, ja and lysolipids similarly to ps-ltp <dig> .fig.  <dig> effect of fas and ja  or lysolipids  on the fluorescence level of the ps-ltp1-tns complex. fas  or ja  or lysolipids  and tns  were incubated together for  <dig> min and then ps-ltp <dig>  was added. each experiment was performed in triplicate. the results are expressed as the mean values  of the percentage of the fluorescence using the ps-ltp1-tns complex without lipids as a control



antimicrobial activity of ps-ltp <dig> against gram-negative bacteria a. tumefaciens and p. syringae gram-positive bacterium c. michiganensis, and phytopathogenic fungi a. alternata, a. niger, a. versicolor, f. oxysporum, f. solani, and n. crassa was studied. it was shown that ps-ltp <dig> possessed antimicrobial activity . f. solani and f. oxysporum were the most sensitive test microorganisms to ps-ltp <dig>  it was shown that ps-ltp <dig> inhibited spore germination and slowed down hyphae elongation of phytopathogenic fungi, but did not induce its morphological distortions.table  <dig> antimicrobial activity of ps-ltp1

an ability of ps-ltp <dig> to induce a leakage of large unilamellar vesicles  containing encapsulated calcein was estimated. the leakage was shown to depend on the protein concentrations for the vesicles composed of the anionic phospholipid popg . on the other hand the leakage was insignificant at all the tested protein concentrations for popc and popc/popg  liposomes .

conformational heterogeneity and secondary structure of ps-ltp1
more than  <dig> cross-peaks of the backbone 1h15n groups were identified in the 2d 15n-hsqc spectrum of ps-ltp <dig>  instead of  <dig> expected . the analysis of 3d 15n-noesy-hsqc spectrum revealed the presence of exchange hn-hn cross-peaks between some of the spin systems . these observations disclose the presence of the two structural forms of the protein in solution caused by the slow  conformational exchange process. . analysis of intensities of diagonal and exchange cross-peaks in the 3d noesy spectrum  permitted to estimate the relative population of the two forms of the protein  and the rate of the exchange between them . this rate corresponds to characteristic time of the exchange process ~  <dig> ms.

the almost complete 1h 13c, and 15n resonance assignment was obtained for the major structural form of ps-ltp <dig>  the spatial structure and dynamics of this form was studied by heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy. the characteristic dαn and dαβ noe contacts, temperature coefficients of amide protons and values of 3jhnhα coupling constants revealed that this form of the protein involved four relatively long helical elements of the secondary structure: cys4-gln <dig> , pro29-ala <dig> , pro45-ser <dig> , and thr66-cys <dig>  . the h1-h <dig> elements have predominantly α-helical conformation, but the turns of 310-helix were observed in the middle of h <dig>  and at the c-terminal end of h <dig> . in addition, the protein molecule involves a long c-terminal tail  which incorporates β-turn and isolated turn of 310-helix .fig.  <dig> nmr data define secondary structure, dynamics and conformational heterogeneity of ps-ltp <dig> in solution. from top to bottom:  root from the sum of squared differences in 1hn and 15nh chemical shifts for the two structural forms. differences in the 15n chemical shifts were scaled by factor  <dig> . the arbitrary taken cutoff value  shows residues subjected to large-amplitude motions in ms time scale.  probability of helix conformation calculated in talos+. the secondary structure of ps-ltp <dig> is shown below the protein sequence. the α- and probable 310-helical elements are shown by white and gray bars, respectively. the helices of the protein are numbered sequentially . the β-turns are denoted by wavy lines. the site of met11leu replacement is underlined.  large , small  and medium  j-couplings are indicated by the up pointing black-filled triangles, gray-filled squares, and down pointing open triangles, respectively.  amide protons which demonstrate fast exchange with water protons are shown by filled circles. the corresponding cross-peaks on the water frequency were observed in the 3d 15n-tocsy-hsqc spectrum .  black-filled stars denote amide protons with temperature gradients less than − <dig>  ppb/k. noe connectivities observed in the  <dig> ms 3d noesy spectra are denoted as usual. steady-state 15n-{1h}-noe values are shown on the bottom of the figure. residues displaying noe <  <dig>  are subjected to enhanced motions in ps-ns time scale



due to low population in solution only limited 1h and 15n resonance assignment  was obtained for the minor structural form of ps-ltp <dig>  very frequently the similar slow conformational exchange in protein molecules is caused by cis-trans isomerization of the xxx-pro peptide bonds. the ps-ltp <dig> molecule accommodates  <dig> pro residues and four of them form one sequential fragment . the obtained 13c chemical shifts for pro residues and observed sequential noe cross-peaks revealed that in the major structural form of the protein the all xxx–pro peptide bonds had trans-configuration. at the same time, the maximal differences in chemical shifts between the two protein forms  were observed in the middle parts of the helices h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig>  and in the c-terminal tail. these regions contain only two proline residues . thus the observed exchange process could be originated by cis-trans isomerization of the ala12-pro <dig> or ile80-pro <dig> peptide bonds, or by some other structural rearrangement . the available experimental data do not permit to distinguish between these possibilities.

the observed conformational exchange process also could be caused by slow binding/unbinding of some hydrophobic molecule presented in the sample. this possibility seems to be quite unlikely. first of all the protein was purified by several chromatographic steps  which removed any traces of hydrophobic impurities. second, if this hypothetic ligand was tightly bound to the protein during purification procedure, it should be detected by mass spectrometry, but this is not the case. moreover, we did not observe any surplus aliphatic signals and noe contacts in the nmr spectra of ps-ltp <dig>  the above data testified that nmr sample contained ps-ltp <dig> in the unliganded form.

spatial structure of the major structural form of ps-ltp1
the set of  <dig> spatial structures  for the major form of ps-ltp <dig> was calculated from the available nmr data . the protein is stabilized by four disulfide bonds  and  <dig> backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds associated with elements of secondary structure. apart from these bonds, the protein structure are stabilized by additional h-bonding and electrostatic interactions . for instance, two possible hydrogen bonds  control the spatial arrangement of helix h <dig> relative to the loop connecting h <dig> and h <dig> helices . the capping interaction  stabilizes the n-terminus of h <dig> helix. in addition, the possible ionic bridge between guanidinium group of arg <dig> and the c-terminal carboxylic group control the relative position of the c-terminal tail relative to h2-h <dig> loop.fig.  <dig> spatial structure and backbone dynamics of the major structural form of ps-ltp <dig> in solution. a. the sets of the best  <dig> structures are superimposed over the backbone atoms in regions with well-defined structure . the disulfide bonds are shown in orange. the helices h1-h <dig> are color coded. b. ribbon representation of the ps-ltp <dig> spatial structure. the ribbon is colored according to obtained dynamical nmr data . the positively charged , negatively charged , and aromatic  side chains/moieties are in blue, red, and green, respectively. the pro residues are shown by cyan plates. the hydrogen bonds between side chain asn <dig>  and co groups of tyr <dig> and pro <dig> , and ionic bridge  are shown by broken lines. c. two-sided view of the ps-ltp <dig> spatial structure. the side chains of hydrophobic residues  which form the internal cavity are colored in yellow. the residues that form the entrance into the internal hydrophobic cavity are marked by underlined lettering. the helices h1-h <dig> are color coded. d, e. two-sided views of the surfaces of ps-ltp <dig> and pru p  <dig>  molecules, superimposed over cα atoms of the eight conserved cys residues. the color code is similar to one used at the other panels, except that pro residues are colored in yellow. the two ige epitopes  are shown on the surface of pru p  <dig> by thick black lines. the ps-ltp <dig> region homologues to conformational epitope of pru p  <dig> is shown by dotted line. the corresponding residues on the both molecules are shown by italic and underlined lettering. ps-ltp <dig> molecules shown on the panels b, right c, and left d have identical orientation. the expected entrance into internal hydrophobic cavity is shown by arrow



the spatial structure of the protein is fairly good defined in the region of the conserved helical core  that stabilized by disulfide bonds . the reduced convergence of the calculated structural ensemble in the n-terminal region  and c-terminal tail   is probably connected with the enhanced intramolecular mobility of these segments . indeed the residues from the c-terminal tail demonstrate largest influence of the observed ms time scale conformational fluctuations . in addition, the measured steady-state 15n-{1h} heteronuclear noe values  revealed enhanced ps-ns time scale mobility at the n- and c-termini of the molecule.

similarly to other ltp1s in the determined ps-ltp <dig> spatial structure the helix h <dig> demonstrates a pronounced kink  at pro <dig> . as a result, the parallel bundle formed by helices h1-h <dig> adopts an overall boat-like shape. the interior of this cavity is lined with apolar side chains and shielded from the aqueous environment by the h <dig> helix and the c-terminal tail. this hydrophobic pocket, having relatively large volume , may play a role in binding of lipids and other hydrophobic molecules. the entrance into the internal hydrophobic cavity  is formed by two conservative fragments, located at the h2-h <dig> loop  and at the c-terminal tail .

in contrast to the inner surface the outer surface of ps-ltp <dig> is lined mostly by polar and charged residues . the several small apolar patches are formed by side chains of not too hydrophobic residues . the largest hydrophobic patch involves residues from h <dig> and h <dig> helices, and h1-h <dig> loop . interestingly, the charged residues are distributed non-uniformly on the outer surface of ps-ltp <dig>  the one side of the molecule , which involve entrance to the hydrophobic cavity, accommodates all charged residues, except lys <dig> and lys <dig> protruding to the other side. only one charged side chain of ps-ltp <dig> has virtually no contact with the outer surface. the positively charged residue  is burred on the interface between h <dig> and h <dig> helices . interestingly, the homologues lc-ltp <dig> protein from lens culinaris has similar spatial position of asp <dig> .

thermal stability of the ps-ltp <dig> spatial structure
one of the steps used during purification of the native ps-ltp <dig> involved prolonged heating at  <dig> °c. to investigate the changes in the spatial structure of the protein upon heating the temperature dependence of the secondary chemical shifts of amide protons  was analyzed . the 20- <dig> °c temperature range was used; higher temperatures were not available due to instrumental limitations. it is well known that Δδ1hn values depend from secondary structure of the protein and could be used as indicators of relative strength of hydrogen bonding at the amide groups  <cit> .

it was found that upon increase in temperature the resonances of the residues, which are strongly influenced by the ms time scale fluctuations, became unobservable. probably, the increase in the rate of the exchange process with temperature change it regime from slow to intermediate on the nmr time scale. on the other hand, the Δδ1hn values for the residues, which are weakly affected by the conformational exchange, have linear temperature dependences . the majority of amide protons from the h1-h <dig> helices demonstrated quite low temperature gradients  and even at the higher temperature have negative Δδ1hn values, which is indicative of the helical conformation . thus one could conclude that neither secondary structure, nor the overall spatial arrangement of ps-ltp <dig> molecule are changed upon increase of the temperature.

in silico analysis for the prediction of allergenicity and cross-reactivity
world health organization , the food and agriculture organization  with the codex alimentarius commission proposed guidelines for assessment of the potential allergenicity of proteins  <cit> . according to these guidelines a protein is potentially allergenic if it shares with known allergen either a match of  <dig> consecutive amino acid residues or an identity of > <dig> % over a  <dig> amino acids window  <cit> . this algorithm is used primarily for identifying allergic cross-reactivity when a high degree of allergens similarity  is observed  <cit> .

a sequence analysis by farrp showed that ps-ltp <dig> has more than  <dig> % identity to more than  <dig> allergenic ltps across  <dig> a.a. window. it shares  <dig> % identity with the lentil allergen len c  <dig>  <dig> %—with the peanut ara h  <dig>   <dig> %—with the green bean pha v  <dig>  and  <dig> %—with the peach pru p  <dig> over a  <dig> a.a. window . it was found, that ps-ltp <dig> also shares at least one identical 6-amino-acid stretch with  <dig> allergenic ltps. most of the matches were observed for len c  <dig>  pha v  <dig>  ara h  <dig>  and pru p  <dig> . presumable allergenic properties were also confirmed by using other web tools, such as allergenfp, algpred and sdap.

three sequential ige epitopes were previously characterized in pru p  <dig>   <cit> . two of them form conformational epitope  which includes three key amino acid residues  providing ige-binding capacity. two of the above mentioned key residues—thr <dig> and arg <dig>  are present on the ps-ltp <dig> surface, while positively charged arg <dig> is replaced by polar thr <dig> . thus, there are some differences in the charge distribution over the region of the presumable conformational ige epitope thr42-ala49/gly77-tyr <dig>  but the region has in whole the similar physical properties  with main epitope of pru p  <dig> .

simulated gastrointestinal proteolysis
the ps-ltp <dig> in vitro fragmentation by enzyme cleavage mimicking gastrointestinal digestion was analyzed by sds-page under reducing conditions . as an internal control α-casein from bovine milk  was added to monitor an enzyme activity. it was shown that ps-ltp <dig> displays a remarkable resistance to gastric digestion with pepsin for  <dig> h . at the same time, α-casein completely degraded by pepsin within the first  <dig> min. upon duodenal digestion, moderate degradation of ps-ltp <dig>  was observed after  <dig> h treatment of the protein with the mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin. thus, it was shown that ps-ltp <dig> is characterized by high stability to gastrointestinal digestion which is typical of food allergens.fig.  <dig> sds-page analysis of in vitro cleavage mimicking gastric and duodenal digestions of ps-ltp1



immunological properties of ps-ltp1
as previously mentioned the most significant similarity was observed between pea ps-ltp <dig> and the lentil allergen len c  <dig>  to verify the immunological similarity of this proteins, a previously obtained rabbit anti-len c  <dig> antiserum  <cit>  was used in western blot and elisa assays. by using sds-page under reducing conditions with following western blot, it was shown that polyclonal rabbit anti-len c  <dig> igg interact with the recombinant len c  <dig>  pru p  <dig>  and ps-ltp <dig> as well as with the native ltp from the pea extract . by elisa assays the most significant binding of anti-len c  <dig> igg with len c  <dig> was shown . the weakest binding was found in case of pru p  <dig> which has lower structural similarity with len c  <dig> than ps-ltp <dig>  these results were also confirmed by inhibition assays in which binding of anti-len c  <dig> igg with len c  <dig> was suppressed by ps-ltp <dig> or pru p  <dig> . the obtained data showed at least partial similarity of igg epitopes of all the three ltps.

the ige-binding was analyzed in vitro by elisa assays using the sera from patients with food allergy containing specific ige to pru p  <dig> . ps-ltp <dig> bounds to specific ige from all the tested sera of pru p  <dig> sensitized patients and its immunoreactivity was quite significant, albeit weaker than that exhibited by pru p  <dig> and len c  <dig>  this attests to the fact that ps-ltp <dig> might be a novel cross-reactive food allergen.fig.  <dig> characterization of sera from patients with food allergy. total ige levels are specified in brackets. data were obtained using 1: <dig> serum dilutions



discussion
plant ltps comprehend a multigenic family with different genes being expressed at various stages of plant ontogeny. biosynthesis of multiple ltp isoforms is tissue-specific. expression of the genes of different ltp isoforms is primarily determined by the environment which makes biosynthesis of multiple ltp isoforms an element of a plant defensive strategy under different abiotic and biotic stresses. the presence of several ltp isoforms was previously demonstrated for the lentil lens culinaris in which a subfamily of  <dig> novel lipid transfer proteins lc-ltp1- <dig> was found  <cit> . in the present study we confirmed that multiple ltp isoforms are also present in the garden pea pisum sativum. three new ltp <dig> isoforms, named as ps-ltp1- <dig>  were found in the pea seeds, and their cdnas were determined. all the precursor proteins contained 24– <dig> a.a. residues signal peptides and  <dig> residues mature proteins, containing  <dig> conservative cysteine residues typical of plant ltps. all the three pea ltps are similar to each other  . preliminary conclusions can be made from experimental expression profiling of the genes of different ps-ltp isoforms.  ps-ltp <dig>  an abundant isoform in ungerminated pea seeds, can participate in lipid mobilization during seeds development and germination. it is ps-ltp <dig> which was isolated from the ungerminated pea seeds and characterized at the protein level. its complete amino acid sequence was determined. the protein contains  <dig> cysteine residues located in highly conserved positions of plant ltp sequences.  expression levels of the ps-ltp <dig> and ps-ltp <dig> genes rose sharply just only after germination and remained at the same level in different pea organs of mature plant. the latter could argue for more general biological roles of these isoforms in plant physiology, such as participating in cell wall growth, signal transduction or defense against pathogens. our results afford further molecular insight into possible biological roles of different ps-ltp isoforms.

previously two mrna encoding ltps have been discovered in the pea seedlings. the first pea ltp  was found only at transcript level  <cit>  and contained  <dig> cysteine residues which is atypical for plant ltps. it was shown that the level of its mrna increased under abiotic stress conditions which confirmed the differential expression of ltp isoforms and their multifunctional properties. the second pea ltp  was found also at transcript level  <cit>  and recently detected at a protein level  <cit> . it was identified by extraction from the pea flour ultra-filtration, reversed-phase fast performance liquid chromatography , sds-page, in-gel digestion by trypsin, and ms/ms tandem mass spectrometry. the protein also has atypical structure and contains  <dig> cysteine residues. it should be noted that the protein was not isolated from the pea flour, but just identified by tandem mass spectrometry of the tryptic digest. apparently, its expression in the pea seeds occurs at very low level. that is why we did not isolate this protein, as our purpose was to identify and characterize the main food allergen being constitutively expressed in the pea seeds at high level.

the presently obtained nmr data revealed structural similarities and dissimilarities of the ps-ltp <dig> with other plant ltp1s. analogously to other ltp1s, ps-ltp <dig> encompasses four α-helices  which surround the internal hydrophobic cavity probably containing the lipid-binding site, and followed by a long c-terminal tail . ps-ltp <dig> can be fairly good superimposed with the unliganded highly homologous allergen protein len c  <dig> from lens culinaris  as well as with the liganded and less homologous allergen pru p  <dig> from peach  . the minimal rmsd between the set of structures, calculated over cα atoms of the eight conserved cysteines, is about  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å, respectively. at the same time, the comparison revealed significant differences in relative orientation of the interhelical loops and the c-terminal tail . these differences led to the slightly different packing of the ps-ltp <dig> helices and to significant increase of the internal hydrophobic cavity volume. in contrast to other unliganded ltp1s having internal cavities with van der waals volume from  <dig> to  <dig> Å <dig> , the lipid-free ps-ltp <dig> holds much larger hydrophobic pocket . this space is sufficient to accommodate double-chain lipid  and is similar to the volumes of internal pockets in the liganded ltp1s . the cavities in the partially and fully liganded pru p  <dig> have the volumes ~  <dig> and  <dig> Å <dig>  respectively.

the major difference of the ps-ltp <dig> from other plant ltp1s is the conformational heterogeneity. in solution the unliganded protein represents the mixture of two conformers with the relative population ~ 85: <dig> and with characteristic time of interconversion between them on the order of a hundred microseconds. presently, we are unable to describe the origin of the exchange process that leads to the conformational heterogeneity of ps-ltp <dig>  it could be connected with the cis-trans isomerization of the ala12-pro <dig> or ile80-pro <dig> peptide bonds or with changes in the conformation of the cys51-cys <dig> disulfide bridge, which connect the c-terminal tail to the helical core of the molecule. however, the involvement of residues from all helices  and the c-terminal tail in this process  implies that the corresponding conformational fluctuations are accompanied by the reshaping of the internal hydrophobic cavity. thus, the minor conformation of ps-ltp <dig> probably corresponds to the structure with collapsed internal cavity, having much less volume, similar to that of other unliganded ltp1s structures. to the best of our knowledge, the conformational heterogeneity in the unliganded plant ltps were not described before.

it is known that plant ltps belong to pathogenesis-related proteins  which are involved in systemic acquired resistance protecting plants from pathogens and infections. the defensive role of many ltps is associated with an ability to inhibit the growth of phytopathogens. however there are some members of ltps family which do not exhibit any antimicrobial activity or inhibit phytopathogenic growth at relatively high concentrations. a novel ltp isolated from the pea seeds has moderate antifungal activity and is characterized by specificity of its action. the most sensitive to ps-ltp <dig> test cultures were fungi of the fusarium genus, causing plant fusariosis, root rot and seedling bligh. it is known that some pea cultivars have high resistance to diseases caused by fungi of the fusarium genus  <cit> . high resistance of pea to fusariosis might be also a result of high expression level of ps-ltp <dig>  a putative target of ltp’s antimicrobial action is cytoplasmic membrane  <cit> . we showed that ps-ltp <dig> disturbs the permeability of artificial liposomes, and it is important to note that liposomes composition is of much importance for this action. ps-ltp <dig> is able to induce the leakage of popg liposomes, and this effect is dependent on the protein concentrations, while popc and popg/popc liposomes remain intact. interestingly, effectiveness of calcein leakage depends on the protein concentrations which correlates to the concentrations used in the antimicrobial assay. probably, the cationic plant ltps interact with anionic components of plasma membranes, leading to destabilization and increase of their permeability. the obtained data prove the ps-ltp <dig> ability to permeabilize model membranes.

it is known that lipids and their derivatives are involved in various plant physiological processes including membrane biogenesis, cell differentiation, inter- and intracellular signaling. it is supposed that different biological functions of ltps are based on their ability to bind and transport various lipid molecules. studies of the lipid-binding properties of ltps can provide helpful data to understand their biological functions. it is suggested that ltp1s are involved in a transport of hydrophobic monomers which compose the waxy and polymeric cutin layers. despite a high sequence homology and similarity of their spatial structures, ltps can exhibit structural differences leading to different affinities to lipids  <cit> . for example, it was shown that the lentil len c  <dig>  has lipid-binding specificity towards unsaturated fas, while the dill ag-ltp  has no significant difference in binding of saturated and unsaturated fas, which could be connected with much larger hydrophobic pocket in ag-ltp  <cit> . the determined here spatial structure of ps-ltp <dig> holds even larger hydrophobic cavity  but also has lipid-binding specificity towards unsaturated fas, which could be linked with the observed conformational heterogeneity of ps-ltp <dig>  probably, the specificity to different lipids is “encoded” in the conformation of the minor structural form of ps-ltp <dig> that responsible only for ~ <dig> % of the protein presented in solution. in this case the process of lipid-binding to the internal cavity should has compatible timescale or be even slower than the observed exchange process .

ltps constitute a family of true allergens which can cause a sensibilization to pollen and especially to foods. the isolated from ungerminated pea seeds ps-ltp <dig> is a constitutively expressing abundant isoform which may exhibit properties of a true allergen. food allergens are often characterized by thermal stability and protease resistance. for example, stability to digestion by the gastrointestinal tract, especially by gastric pepsin, has been claimed as a characteristic of a true food allergens  <cit> . moreover, their stability to heat treatment also implies the presence of active allergen forms in processed foodstuffs. due to its extreme resistance to gastrointestinal enzymes, ps-ltp <dig> can be evaluated as a potentially severe food allergen. nmr thermal stability experiments and heat treatment of ps-ltp <dig> allow to label the protein as heat-resistant one. moreover, ltps belong to the most clinically relevant classes of cross-reactive plant allergens. because of their extremely conserved structures, the ltp1s were found to be responsible for ige cross-reactions not only between foods, but also between unrelated pollen and plant food allergen sources, and were therefore classified as panallergens. for example, the peach pru p  <dig> is a major cross-reactive allergen of ltp <dig> family which plays a predominant role in sensitization of the majority of allergic patients. we showed that isolated pea ltp has high amino acids similarity to several food allergens, including the lentil len c  <dig>  peanut ara h  <dig>  and peach pru p  <dig>  commonly, highly conserved molecules having sequence similarities often share surface topology relevant for allergenicity. the known structures of antibody-allergen complexes indicate at least a partial overlapping of the igg epitopes with ige ones  <cit> . we showed that ps-ltp <dig> seems to share igg epitopes with other two iuis food allergens, namely len c  <dig> and pru p  <dig>  and has similar capacity to bind ige from patients with food allergies. similar ige-immunoreactivity could be caused by existence of similar ige-binding epitopes on proteins’ surfaces. it is suggested that the ige-binding region should exhibit both a protuberant local surface and an electrostatically active local molecular domain  <cit> . in this regard, physical properties of thr42-ala49/gly77-tyr <dig> region of ps-ltp <dig>  which is homologous to conformational epitope of pru p  <dig>  allow to consider it as most probable ige epitope of the protein. it should be noted, that the same region was identified also as the major conformational epitope of the wheat tri a  <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the residues from this region restrict the entrance into internal hydrophobic cavity in case of both ps-ltp <dig> and pru p  <dig> and participate in lipid-binding . moreover in case of pru p  <dig>  above mentioned crucial residue for ige-binding arg <dig> as well as incorporated in ige-binding region polar tyr <dig> are highly conserved for plant ltp1s and presumably responsible also for lipid uptake  <cit> . this permits to speculate that one region on the surface of plant ltp1s is responsible for both interaction with lipid molecules and ige-binding.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary we discovered and isolated a novel lipid transfer protein from the garden pea pisum sativum. here, we developed a procedure for ltp isolation from the pea seeds. molecular cloning and sequencing of cdnas encoding the ps-ltp <dig> precursor and two other isoforms were performed. complete amino acid sequence and solution structure of ps-ltp <dig> were determined. the bacterial expression system for production of the recombinant ps-ltp <dig> and its 13c,15n-labeled analogue was developed. a biological activity of ps-ltp <dig> as well as its lipid-binding capacity were studied. for the first time, the conformational heterogeneity in the unliganded plant ltps, probably connected with reshaping of the internal lipid-binding cavity, was observed. the reported structural and immunological findings seem to describe ps-ltp <dig> as potential cross-reactive food allergen in ltp-sensitized patients, mostly pru p 3+ ones.
