BACKGROUND
the production of biopharmaceuticals for human use began in  <dig> with recombinant insulin, and the development of new biopharmaceuticals has grew almost exponentially ever since. over the past two decades, chinese hamster ovary  cells have become the standard mammalian host cell line, with the expression and production of nearly 70% of all biopharmaceuticals  <cit> . cho cells provide efficient post-translational modifications, which allow the production of recombinant proteins with glycoforms that are both compatible with, and bioactive in humans  <cit> . cho cells can also be easily manipulated genetically, which has become of great importance more recently  <cit> . these two characteristics are especially important in the production of biosimilars, where achieving the correct extent of similarity to the reference molecule is a great challenge. the nucleotide sequence of the gene that encodes amino-acid sequence of the desired protein is the same as for the reference molecule. in contrast, post-translational modifications that are the consequence of metabolic pathways can differ between host cell lines, clones, cultivation conditions, medium composition, specific productivity and physiologic state of the cell  <cit> . consequently, these need to be fine-tuned during development. in addition to posttranslational modifications, different charge variants can result in heterogeneity in the production of monoclonal antibodies . these modifications potentially result in changes to the bioactivity, bioavailability or immunogenicity of the mabs, and they therefore need to be additionally characterised to ensure the safety, quality and efficacy of the product. among these, c-terminal amidated structures on the heavy chains of mabs have recently attracted particular attention  <cit> .

c-terminal α-amidation is catalysed by peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase , and this protein modification is often required to confer full biological activity to peptide hormones  <cit> . amidation is catalysed starting from a glycine-extended prohormone, by two sequential actions of two enzymes, peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase and peptydilamido-glycolat lyase. in mammals, both of these enzymes are derived from a single gene, which gives rise to the bi-functional pam protein  <cit> . pam thus catalyses the conversion of peptidylglycine substrates into α-amidated products in a two-step reaction, and it is the only enzyme known to catalyse the formation of amidated peptides  <cit> .

recently, large proteins like immunoglobulins have been reported to be substrates for pam  <cit> , and the expression of pam in cho cells was reported previously  <cit> . tsubaki et al. reported that c-terminal α-amidation was detected in  <dig> of  <dig> recombinant mabs, with ratios from  <dig> % to  <dig> %  <cit> . during our studies, we have also observed the presence of c-terminal amidated species in recombinant mabs produced in cho cells. prolinamide was detected in up to 14% of all mab molecules, which was too high to accomplish the desired similarity to the reference molecule.

it was previously shown that the level of mab amidation in cho cells can be affected via bioprocesses and medium optimisation, with the addition of copper to the culture medium  <cit> . on the other hand, metabolic engineering is becoming a powerful tool to manipulate expression hosts for improved product quality, and the introduction of a pam knocked-down cell line that can produce mabs with desired comparability to a reference molecule would be a state-of-the-art solution.

in the present study, the expression of pam, and consequently the c-terminal amidation of recombinant mabs, was reduced by two approaches: gene manipulation using rna interference  and zinc finger nucleases . rnai has been efficiently used for down-regulation of desired genes, and it can be performed using chemically synthesised small-interfering rna molecules, or via the endogenous expression of short-hairpin rna molecules that are encoded by plasmid vectors  <cit> . while sirnas can provide transient knock-down of expression of a target gene, shrna vectors can induce long-term expression of rnai silencing in a target cell  <cit> . the ease and rapidity of these rnai approaches have made them the method of choice for initial target validation.

however, using rnai, complete elimination of expression of the target gene is rarely obtained. to achieve permanent gene knock-out, zfns can offer a distinct advantage. moreover, the growing number of reports using zfns across different species suggests that zfn-mediated gene disruption is a robust and general method for targeted gene knock-out. as this approach results in an alteration of the genome itself, these mutations are transmitted stably through all of the subsequent generations of the cell line, as is the case with conventional gene targeting  <cit> . rapid gene knock-out can be achieved by using a zfn approach to create a double-stranded break in the locus of interest, which allows it to be repaired by non-homologous end-joining; this ligates the two broken ends, with the occasional loss of genetic information. zfns can therefore be used to introduce small deletions at the site of such a break, an outcome that can be exploited to disrupt a target gene  <cit> . the high frequencies of gene disruption strongly support the likelihood of achieving a desired genotype, in which each copy of the target gene is functionally knocked out in 1% to 50% of all cells  <cit> .

RESULTS
sirna and shrna experiments
c-terminal amidation is a common posttranslational modification that is seen on therapeutic mabs  <cit> , and which has also been observed during recombinant mab development . the significant variations between clones during clone selection, and the relatively high content of amidated species in comparison to reference molecules, directed us towards the development of a cell line with reduced production of c-terminal amidated species.

rnai has already been efficiently used for the improvement of cellular productivity and the quality of recombinant proteins produced in cho cells. rnai had thus been used for silencing apoptosis-associated gene expression  <cit> , glycosylation-associated gene expression  <cit> , and gene expression of lactate dehydrogenase  <cit>  and dihydrofolate reductase  <cit> .

fifteen different sirnas were designed on the basis of the c. griseus pam nucleotide sequence and tested on the cho der <dig> parental cell line. up to an 8-fold decrease was observed in pam mrna expression levels using sirnas from invitrogen, and up to a 5-fold decrease using sirnas from ambion . on the basis of these data, and due to shrna design limitations, sirnas si <dig> and si <dig>  were selected for the design of shrnas, to obtain long-term silencing of pam. sirna knock-down of the target lasts for  <dig> to 5 days, and therefore to induce long-term expression of rnai silencing in the target cells, an shrna vector has to be used  <cit> . the shrna silencing effect was tested on two different cho parental cell lines, cho der <dig> and cho der <dig>  and on two mab-expressing clones derived from the cho der <dig> cell line, clone k <dig> with high , and clone k <dig> with low , prolinamide contents in the mab that was produced . after shrna transfection and antibiotic selection, all of the generated pools were analysed by cation-exchange chromatography , for evaluation of the prolinamide content . the shrna designed on the basis of the si <dig> sirna was shown to have the most potent silencing effect on all of the transfected cell lines .

the data presented in figure  <dig> show the correlation between pam mrna expression levels and c-terminal amidation of the recombinant mab. up to a 4-fold decrease in mrna and a 3-fold decrease in prolinamide content were observed. as can be seen from figure  <dig>  the prolinamide content for clone k <dig> was decreased to  <dig> %, which represents a 3-fold decrease, and for clone k <dig>  where the initial starting point was  <dig> % prolinamide content, only a minimal reduction was obtained. nevertheless, there is an interesting observation here that should be considered. no matter which clone is considered, as one with a previously high  or low  prolinamide content, the reduction in the prolinamide content after shrna knock-down never decreased below 4%, which is the same as the level of the reference molecule.

zfn experiments
the shrna experiments gave very promising results, as they yielded pam levels that were comparable to the reference molecule. however, possible toxicity effects on long-term expression and the additional metabolic load on the cells due to the overexpression of these factors during times of stress might also influence cell performance. in addition, shrna-mediated knock-down relies on the constant expression of repressor molecules, which can be unstable in the knocked-down cells in the long term  <cit> . rnai instability was reported by lim et al. in the silencing of the bax and bak genes, where 1% of the screened clones was silenced for both genes, but there was instability of the generated knock-down clones  <cit> . this is an undesirable feature during the mab production process, as it can cause heterogeneity of the product  <cit> . to avoid such problems, rapid and permanent gene knock-out using zfns can offer distinct advantages. moreover, the growing number of reports using zfns across different species have suggested that zfn-mediated gene disruption is a robust and general method for targeted gene knock-out. zfn-mediated gene knock-out requires only transient expression of the zfns, and it can result in a permanent genetic mutation that is stably transmitted through all of the subsequent generations of the cell line  <cit> .

the first reported example of the use of engineered zfns to disrupt an endogenous locus in a mammalian cell was a knock-out of the dihydrofolate reductase gene in cho cells. the observed bi-allelic mutation rate was 2% to 3%. in comparison to traditional methods, this frequency of gene disruption is very high, and it increases the possibility of achieving the desired genotype in which each copy of the target gene is functionally knocked out  <cit> .

zfns have also already been successfully used for the generation of many different knocked-out cho cell lines. they have been reported as used to create triple knock-out cho cells, with the disruption of the two selectable marker genes of glutamine synthetase and dihydrofolate reductase, as well as the gene encoding α- <dig> -fucosyltransferase   <cit> . bak and bax deletion was also achieved, to produce apoptosis-resistant cho cells  <cit> . additionally a fut <dig> knock-out cho cell line has been reported  <cit> .

thus, zfns were used to create a cell line with stably knocked-down pam expression, so as to reduce c-terminal amidated species on the target mab. these zfns were designed on the basis of a sequence that had been shown to generate silencing effects using rnai. initially, zfn plasmid dna was used for the transfections of the parental cho der <dig> and cho der <dig> cell lines. the knock-out effect was evaluated by determination of the pam gene copy number using qpcr. this method was evaluated using the cell-i nuclease mismatch assay , which is usually used to evaluate knock-out clones. the qpcr method has been shown to be less laborious and time consuming, and therefore it enables efficient screening of the high numbers of clones generated.

in all,  <dig> clones were generated from the cho der <dig> cell line, and  <dig> clones from the cho der <dig> cell line. in contrast to the cho der <dig> cell line, which is diploid, the cho der <dig> cell line was shown by karyotyping to be a triploid , and a knock-out was therefore more difficult to achieve. a partial reduction of the pam copies in the cho der <dig> and cho der <dig> cell lines was achieved . reported knock-out efficiencies for single copy genes have been higher than 1%  <cit> , and have reached 5%  <cit> . thus, to detect a single clone with a total knock-out that would be reflected in a mab without functional pam, around  <dig> clones would need to be generated, and in the case of the triploid cho der <dig> cell line, this would be higher.

the pam mrna expression was evaluated for the  <dig> best clones by qpcr, and high correlation was observed with the copy number determination at the genomic dna level .

to determine the mrna expression levels, the pam mrna was calculated per housekeeping gene. the choice of a housekeeping gene can often be quite challenging, as expression is usually not the same across different cho cell lines and clones, and can also vary according to the physiological state of the cells. to avoid these effects, four different housekeeping genes were tested in the present study: actb, gapdh, g6pd and ef <dig> . all four of these housekeeping genes were shown to be suitable for the calculation of the mrna expression levels , with the data below are based on the use of actb as the housekeeping gene.

pam, peptidylglycine amidating monooxygenase; actb, β-actin; gapdh, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ef <dig>  elongation factor 1; g6pd, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.

the three best clones were transfected with a plasmid containing the mab expression cassette. after 4 weeks of antibiotic selection and 14 days of fed-batch cultivation, the mabs produced from these three clones were evaluated for the presence of prolinamide, using cex. the data from the pam gene copy numbers, mrna expression levels, and prolinamide content are presented in figure  <dig>  the prolinamide levels for both of the cho der <dig> and cho der <dig> cell lines after evaluation using cex were determined to have decreased to 6%. as observed with the shrna , there was correlation between copy number, mrna expression, and prolinamide content of the recombinant mab .

transfections using zfn plasmid dna result in its random integration into the genome of cho cells and continuous expression of the zfn. genome integration is not desired, due to the continuous zfn activity, and thus potential off-target effects. the mechanism of zfn target recognition has been reported to be highly specific, with usually an 18-bp site recognized and the dimerisation of two zfns needed to cause a double-stranded break  <cit> . despite this, some off-target effects have also been observed. off-target effects of  <dig> % were reported for the disruption of the ccr <dig> hiv receptor by klug et al.  <cit> .

to avoid this, the transfections were performed using zfn mrna, for transient zfn expression. the zfn mrna was prepared in-house using in-vitro transcription from the two zfn plasmid dnas. the cells were then transfected with the two zfn mrnas; i.e., zfn <dig> and zfn <dig>  various amounts for the combination of these two mrnas were tested: total mrnas of 30 μg to 60 μg per transfection. the 50 μg mrnas transfection  was the most promising combination. the concentrations of the mrnas used for the transfections correlated with the silencing effects, although the higher mrna concentrations decreased the cell viability to <80% . the pools were evaluated by qpcr on day  <dig> following transfection. a 50% knock-out was achieved for the generated pools, and the cell viability was >80%, which is needed for seeding into the semi-solid medium for clone generation using clonepix.

these mrna transfections were used only with the cho der <dig> cell line. here,  <dig> clones were evaluated and two were determined to be completely knocked-out at the genomic dna level by qpcr , which represented a 1% knock-out efficiency. the  <dig> best clones were again tested for pam mrna expression , and afterwards the best three of these  <dig> clones were transfected with a plasmid containing the mab expression cassette, in duplicates, and evaluated by cex . these data are presented in figure  <dig> 

the c-terminal amidated structures in all of these tested clones decreased to a limit of 6%, which was the same as observed using zfn plasmid dna. mrna expression and c-terminal amidation were observed for all of these tested clones, even though this was not expected for clones k <dig> and k <dig> 

down-regulation of pam did not have any influence on cell growth, in comparison to the non-silenced controls. all of the cells showed similar cell growth, which did not differ from that expected for cho cells. additionally, there was no correlation between cell productivity and c-terminal amidation of the produced mab .

the silencing effects that were obtained using the rnai approach showed more promising results in terms of prolinamide reduction on the recombinant mab. in this case, prolinamide was reduced to 3%. as indicated above, sirna effects are only transient  <cit>  and the shrna approach is also questionable, due to long-term stability problems and the additional metabolic burden on the cells. using the zfn approach, the decrease in prolinamide was not as effective as with shrna, as it was reduced to 6%. on the other hand, this zfn approach has the advantage of producing a stable genetic modification, which is very important for the production scale.

after transfection with the mab-expressing plasmid, each of these two generated zfn knocked-down cell lines  represented a mixed cell population with a mean prolinamide content of 6%. in comparison to the negative controls, which generated 15%  and 14%  prolinamide content, this represents a decrease in the prolinamide content of >50%. these pools with mean prolinamide content of 6% thus represent good starting points for the isolation of candidate clones that express different amounts of c-terminal amidated species, thus providing the choice for the one that is the most comparable to the reference molecule.

the higher efficiency of the knock-down achieved using shrna in comparison to zfn might be because the shrna targets the degradation of the pam mrna, which will reduce its expression overall. for the zfns, the knock-out effects are at the level of the genomic dna, and if total knock-out is not achieved in all of the copies, the expression of a functional mrna will still take place, and thus the translation into the functional pam protein will not be fully blocked. disruption of the target gene can occur by causing a shift in the reading frame, the generation of a premature termination codon, or the deletion of critical amino-acid residues. however, the result of non-homologous end joining repair might be only an amino-acid point mutation or a deletion of the protein molecule, which might result in a partially or fully functional enzyme.

however, the goal of the present study was not to generate a completely knocked-out cho cell line, but to decrease the content of the c-terminal amidated structures to a level that is sufficiently comparable to the reference molecule, and this was successfully achieved using both approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
during development, c-terminal amidated species are detected on recombinant mabs, an observation that was also recently reported in other studies  <cit> . c-terminal amidation can be reduced by development and optimisation of the grwth medium, and use of cofactors such as copper  <cit> , although these approaches are project specific and time consuming. due to its extensive development, metabolic engineering has provided a powerful tool to diminish the expression of the pam gene through gene alterations using rnai and zfns. in the present study, both of these approaches were tested. the rnai was conducted for the initial target validation, for the later zfn knock-out. using the shrna approach, decreases in c-terminal amidation were achieved for two mab-producing clones: the k <dig> with low prolinamide content , and the k <dig> clone with high  prolinamide content, which were decreased to  <dig> % and 5%, respectively. the prolinamide levels of the reference molecule were 4%, and therefore a comparability level was successfully achieved. in this case, the gene silencing was performed on two clones that were already expressing the desired mab.

for recombinant mab production, a parental cell line with stably reduced pam expression is desired. to achieve this, genome alterations using zfns are the more appropriate tool, as breaks are created at the genomic dna level that are stably transferred through the subsequent generations of the cell line  <cit> . two cho cell lines were generated, as cho der <dig> and cho der <dig> cells, and they were evaluated for pam at the genomic dna and mrna expression levels. after the selection of the three most promising clones, these were transfected with a mab-producing plasmid and evaluated for the c-terminal amidated species. the c-terminal amidation was decreased to 6% in both of these cell lines, which represents a 50% lower content in comparison to the zfn non-treated controls. the two generated cell lines now represent two pools from which candidate clones with the highest comparability to the reference molecule can be selected.

thus, this use of genetically manipulated cell lines now gives us the opportunity to go even further towards providing high-quality and safe therapeutics.
