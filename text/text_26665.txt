BACKGROUND
the capsicum genus consists of  <dig> species  <cit> , five of which have been domesticated and are used worldwide as vegetables, spices and condiments: capsicum annuum l., capsicum frutescens l., capsicum chinense j., capsicum pubescens r. & p. and capsicum baccatum l. these species are cultivated around the world except for c. pubescens, which is only grown in the andean region. nevertheless, non-pungent cultivars of c. annuum are the most-consumed, and are the main objective of most breeding programs  <cit> . c. pubescens, c. baccatum, c. chinense and c. frutescens are good sources of characters for the breeding of c. annuum, in addition to their economic and agronomic relevance. for instance, the l gene involved in resistance to tobacco mosaic virus  <cit>  was introgressed into modern c. annuum cultivars from c. frutescens, c. chinense and the wild species capsicum chacoense h., while the tsw gene, which determines local lesion response to tomato spotted wilt virus  <cit> , was introgressed from c. chinense. moreover, resistance to cucumber mosaic virus, identified in c. baccatum, has been employed to develop several tolerant cultivars in france and hungary  <cit> .

genebanks maintain collections of different accessions that represent a great genetic wealth that can be explored for the breeding of traits or marker development. nevertheless, the phenotypic characterisation of complete collections requires great effort. we need an alternative approach, one that is more efficient and less costly, in order to exploit this wealth in a practical way. ecotilling allows natural polymorphisms  or small indels) to be identified quickly and easily in target genes  <cit> . the technique is based on the mutation detection approach used in tilling   <cit> . the cel i  <cit>  or endo <dig>  <cit>  endonucleases are used to recognise and cut all mismatched sites present in the heteroduplex of test and standard samples. in the last few years, several studies have used this high-throughput technology in different plants. initially, comai et al. adapted tilling to a natural population of arabidopsis thaliana h.  <cit>  and named it ecotilling to denote that it tests natural variability and not mutagenised populations. the first study of a cultivated species was done on rice   <cit> . ecotilling has been used in barley   <cit> , melon   <cit> , wheat   <cit> , wild peanut   <cit>  and in the invasive aquatic plant monochoria vaginalis b.  <cit> . ecotilling has also been used to detect snps in natural populations of several species  <cit> .

as occurs with other vegetables, viral diseases are also the main limiting factor in pepper cultivation. the economic losses caused by viral diseases are quite significant, making the identification of new sources of viral resistance one of the main objectives of pepper breeders. developing resistant cultivars provides an effective means for reducing the impact of diseases, but it requires constant effort as new virus isolates that overcome resistances are continuously produced in the host/parasite evolution race. screening for new resistant sources in genebanks is a laborious and expensive task, and is a perfect example of the utility of ecotilling, as the technique allows accessions with different alleles of candidate genes to be identified and reduces the number of samples that need to be phenotyped.

the key to identifying new traits of interest using ecotilling is target gene selection. the cloning of several genes that confer recessive resistance to viruses has shown that they code for eukaryotic translation initiation factors of the 4f family. the factor 4f is made up of two subunits: eif4e and eif4g. an isoform of eif4f, eif4f, which is formed by the eif4e and eif4g subunits, has been identified in plants  <cit> . alleles of c. annuum , c. chinense  and solanum habrochaites s. & d.  that confer resistance to potato virus y  and tobacco etch virus  code for the translation initiation factor 4e, eif4e  <cit> . mutant alleles of the eif4e gene block the multiplication of other members of the potyviridae family in different crops: lettuce  <cit> , pea  <cit> , watermelon  <cit> , barley  <cit>  and common bean  <cit> . another example of resistance to potyviruses are the ems-induced mutant alleles at the lsp <dig> locus of a. thaliana that code for the eif4e factor  <cit> . the combination of eif4e and eif4e mutations in pepper confers resistance to pepper veinal mottle virus  <cit>  and chilli veinal mottle virus  <cit> . there are also examples of mutations in the eif4e, eif4g and eif4g initiation factors that confer resistance to other viral families in different species: in melon   <cit> , a. thaliana   <cit>  and in rice   <cit> . all these data show that the interaction between plant translation initiation factors and viral rna is necessary for viral replication and complete infection  <cit> . studies have demonstrated that the interaction between eif4e and vpg is necessary for potyviruses to complete their infectious cycle, and that eif4e resistance-related factors alter the vpg binding function  <cit> . it is therefore apparent that certain mutations in translation initiation factors 4e, eif4g and eif4g) break the virus cycle without affecting the plant life cycle. it is also clear that an interruption of viral infection can occur when a host factor is modified. for instance, mutations in the eif4e factor inhibit the multiplication of potato virus y  <cit> , one of the most aggressive pathogens of pepper worldwide. this virus causes distortion and mosaic on leaves and plant stunting, as well as deformation of fruits, producing severe yield reductions. thus, these genes are potential targets in the search for new resistant sources to this and other viruses, and in identifying resistance alleles to effectively combat the appearance of new isolates that break resistance, as viral pathogens must generate a new function to overcome new resistance.

in this paper, we have developed a cdna-based ecotilling platform in pepper. we have used cdna to detect haplotype variants of the eif4e and eif4e genes inside cds . this approach avoids intron sequences and reduces the difficulty of amplifying target genes from different species  <cit> .  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotide changes have been identified in eif4e and eif4e, respectively. our results demonstrate that this platform contains enough variability to detect new mutations in the eif4e and eif4e genes in pepper. moreover, to demonstrate the utility of these new allelic variants, we have tested them for pvy resistance. five new resistance alleles of the eif4e gene were detected. these results show the utility of this platform in searching for new alleles of other candidate genes, which will be very useful in pepper breeding.

RESULTS
cdna-based ecotilling platform
we analysed  <dig> cultivated accessions of the capsicum genus  and  <dig> accessions of two wild species  . these accessions were selected from the comav genebank according to their geographical origin and morphological variability. the accessions were collected from south america , where cultivated peppers show high morphological and genetic variability  <cit> , and from the canary islands. we built up a cdna platform in 96-well format.

screening of the eif4e gene by ecotilling
the eif4e gene in pepper is organised into five exons and shows a conserved exon/intron structure when compared to a. thaliana and rice  <cit> . we used the cdna platform for the screening to detect eif4e allelic variants. this strategy avoids the problem of intron localisation and variability and reduces the number of pcr and cel i reactions. the completed orf  was amplified by nested pcr, using two specific 3' utr primers and a forward primer from the beginning of the cds. a unique band was obtained in most of the accessions, but no amplification bands were obtained in  <dig> accessions of c. pubescens,  <dig> of c. baccatum,  <dig> of c. frutescens,  <dig> of c. chinense nor in any accessions of c. eximium, even though different amplification conditions were assayed. the amplified cdna was quantified and used in the ecotilling reaction. in a first round of classification, all accessions were compared against the cdna of the cdp <dig> accession, and  <dig> different bands were detected. samples were classified according to the presence or absence of these bands, including weak bands, in order to maximise the identification of very similar haplotypes. finally,  <dig> different patterns were obtained and used to group the accessions. sixteen samples showed no band and were classified with the cdp <dig> group. the majority of groups were species-specific, and  <dig> groups contained only one accession. to confirm this initial classification, an internal standard sample was selected in the more numerous groups and common standards for the smaller groups with a similar band pattern. after doing the enzyme reactions with the new standards, a more detailed classification was done and the groups were reduced to  <dig> 

to determine the allelic variants of the eif4e gene, an accession from each group was selected and sequenced. after cdna sequencing, the  <dig> groups were reduced to  <dig>  as several ecotilling groups with similar band patterns and few samples were shown to have the same sequence. this discrepancy between ecotilling and sequencing groups could be explained by the presence of mutations in nearby sites, partial digestions, experimental errors and the inclusion of weak bands to maximise haplotype identification. in the end,  <dig> groups corresponded to homozygous samples and  <dig> to heterozygous samples. most of the haplotypes were species-specific , but eif4e_b <dig> was detected in c. annuum and c. chinense, eif4e_g <dig> in c. chinense and c. frutescens and eif4e_f <dig> was present in all three. the most variable species was c. baccatum, with eight alleles in both homozygous and heterozygous plants. in contrast, c. pubescens showed only one haplotype, eif4e_j <dig>  seven heterozygous plants of c. baccatum were inferred from the haplotypes found in other accessions. in one instance of eif4e_q1sh <dig>  the eif4e_sh <dig> haplotype had not been detected in homozygosis. the other heterozygous plants were detected in c. chinense  and c. frutescens .

a, haplotypes were named with a letter  and a number . the heterozygous plants were named according to the two known haplotypes when identified in homozygosis. b, heterozygote with one allele detected in homozygosis  and the other undetected .

after the sequencing analysis,  <dig> polymorphic sites were detected in all exons except in exon  <dig>  the number of changes per exon was  <dig> in exon  <dig>   <dig> in exon  <dig>   <dig> in exon  <dig> and  <dig> in exon  <dig>  a total of  <dig> changes were identified, as two sites showed three different nucleotides. nucleic acid sequences for each haplotype were translated, and  <dig> nucleotidic changes of the  <dig> were synonymous.

the sequences were aligned with the published alleles . the sequenced orfs from two haplotypes were identical to others previously found in different studies: the eif4e_e <dig> nucleotide sequence was identical to the pvr <dig> allele of cultivar yolo y   <cit> , as was the eif4e_b <dig> sequence to allele pvr2+ carried by yolo wonder   <cit>  and doux long des landes   <cit> .

analysis of the eif4e amino acid sequence
the translation of nucleotide sequences resulted in  <dig> non-silent changes. however, these mutations resulted in  <dig> amino acid changes, as two mutations of c. pubescens affected the same codon . the  <dig> nucleotidic sequences from haplotypes were translated and  <dig> different predicted proteins were identified . most of the mutations were located in exon  <dig>  where  <dig> amino acid substitutions were identified, five of which generated a change of charge in the amino acid. the majority of the changes were species-specific, but four mutations  were shared by different species . c. chinense had the largest number of specific non-silent changes with six mutations , whereas only one change was detected in c. frutescens  and c. chacoense .

a, the alignment and amino acid positions are numbered according to the published eif4e protein of pvr2+ allele. b, protein from eif4e_sh1-inferred haplotype was not named but had been used to analyse the variable positions.

the eif4e proteins identified in our ecotilling platform as well as the proteins already published in the databases and articles were aligned with clustal x . apart from the published haplotypes, eif4e_e <dig> and eif4e_b <dig>  several partial proteins of the eif4e factor were identical to already known proteins. thus, the eif4e_f <dig>  eif4e_f <dig> and eif4e_f <dig> haplotypes with synonymous changes code for the same protein, eif4e_f. this protein was the same as the eif4e protein of cultivars that carry the pvr1+ allele, habanero   <cit>  and diego . the accessions with the eif4e_a protein had the same amino acids as the pvr <dig> allele of cv. dempsey   <cit> , and the eif4e_i protein was identical to the eif4e protein of the pvr <dig> alleles identified in usda accessions, pi <dig>   <cit>  and pi <dig> . finally, we detected  <dig> amino acid changes and  <dig> protein variants  that had not been previously published .

screening of the eif4e gene by ecotilling
amplification and analysis of the eif4e coding sequence was carried out as with the eif4e gene. the exon/intron structure of the eif4e gene is unknown in pepper but has been described in tomato  and a. thaliana . this initiation factor is organised into  <dig> exonic regions. the exon/intron structure will most likely be conserved in pepper, but the intron sequence most likely will not. as a result, to amplify the exons it will be necessary to sequence the intron boundaries in order to develop the eif4e primers. the cdna platform was therefore used to detect eif4e allelic variants.

all samples were amplified and quantified by agarose gel. for this gene, the cdna of the cdp <dig> accession was chosen as reference and mixed with the other samples in the first grouping. after enzymatic digestion, a total of  <dig> bands were selected between  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp. all of these bands were used to classify the samples into  <dig> groups. to confirm the initial classification, new reactions were carried out using an internal standard for each large group and a common standard for related smaller ones. finally, the samples were classified into  <dig> groups; of these, two groups contained 47% of the samples: one with 58% of the c. baccatum plants and another with 75% of the accessions of c. chinense and c. frutescens.

a sample from each group was selected and sequenced. after cdna sequencing, the  <dig> groups were reduced to  <dig> because some ecotilling groups had the same sequence, as was previously detected for the eif4e gen. these false positive rates were due to weak bands that were taken into account to minimise the haplotype loss. the eif4e sequences of capsicum showed a high level of polymorphism. thus,  <dig> polymorphic nucleotide positions over the cds were detected and  <dig> nucleotide changes were identified. one position had three different nucleotides.

a total of  <dig> haplotypes of the eif4e gene were detected . all haplotypes were species-specific except eif4e_b <dig>  which was present in all accessions of c. chinense and was also the most common in c. frutescens. only three heterozygous samples were detected, one in c. annuum, eif4e_d1c <dig>  and two in c. pubescens, eif4e_h1ih <dig>  with inferred haplotype eif4e_ih <dig> not detected in homozygosis, and eif4e_jhet, with unknown phase. c. pubescens and c. baccatum were the most variable for the eif4e initiation factor, as each showed between four and five different haplotypes. only the eif4e_c <dig> nucleotide sequence was identical to a previously published allele, pvr6+ carried by floridavr <dig>   <cit> , yolo y   <cit>  and yolo wonder   <cit>  cultivars. all the partial sequences of eif4e orfs 4e_jhet) were translated, and  <dig> changes out of  <dig> were synonymous.

a, haplotypes were named with a letter  and a number . the heterozygous plants were named according to the two known haplotypes when identified in homozygosis. b, heterozygote with one allele detected in homozygosis 4e_h1) and the other undetected 4e_ih1). c, heterozygote with unknown phase.

analysis of the eif4e amino acid sequence
fourteen non-synonymous changes were identified in homozygous and heterozygous individuals . these mutations were located between the n-term of the protein and the middle region, up to the 119th amino acid . only three changes were shared by the different species: a20e , p <dig> s  and a90t ; the other  <dig> mutations were specific to different species. although only two accessions of c. eximium were sequenced, it was, along with c. pubescens, the species with the most specific mutations, as each had four changes. one non-synonymous change was detected in c. chacoense  as were two others in c. baccatum .

a, the alignment and amino acid positions are numbered according to the published eif4e protein of pvr6+ allele. b, f: florida vr <dig> yy: yolo y. yw: yolo wonder. c. proteins from inferred or unknown haplotypes were not named but were used to analyse the variable positions.

an alignment with the clustal x program was carried out which included the partial eif4e proteins detected and those already published. besides the eif4e_c <dig> sequence , the haplotypes eif4e_c <dig>  eif4e_c <dig>  eif4e_c <dig> and eif4e_c <dig> coded for the same protein, eif4e_c, which was detected in 36% of the accessions. the other nine detected haplotypes did not correspond to any known protein variant.

response of selected accessions by ecotilling to mechanical inoculation with the f14k isolate of pvy
a screening with potato virus y was done to discover if the new eif4e and eif4e alleles detected in homozygosis confer resistance to this virus. in our ecotilling collection, we identified  <dig> eif4e and  <dig> eif4e proteins in homozygosis. we tested  <dig> accessions which represent  <dig> of the  <dig> eif4e/eif4e combinations . these plants were inoculated mechanically with pvy-f14k isolate. the susceptible controls, negral  and agridulce , were infected and were das-elisa positive, showing symptoms as of the beginning of the survey ) . these susceptible accessions showed leaf deformation, venal chlorosis and mosaic. dark green vein-banding and stunted growth were detected later in these plants . these lesions were used to score the pvy symptoms from  <dig> for symptomless plants to  <dig> for dead plants. in agridulce, the cultivar symptoms score and das-elisa absorbance mean were higher than in negral. absorbance was higher than  <dig>  in agridulce plants and  <dig>  in negral. the f14k isolate of pvy completed the viral cycle in all analysed species and no plant died during the experiment . the cdp <dig>  cdp <dig> and cdp <dig> accessions of c. annuum, cdp <dig> and cdp <dig> of c. chinense, cdp <dig>  cdp <dig>  cdp <dig> of c. frutescens and the single accessions of c. chacoense  and c. pubescens  showed a similar response to that of the susceptible controls. the cdp <dig> accession of c. baccatum showed a susceptible response too, but the symptoms were milder than in other susceptible plants, showing a maximum symptom score of  <dig> . the susceptible accessions showed a maximum symptom index between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and a mean maximum absorbance between  <dig>  and  <dig> . cdp <dig>  cdp <dig>  cdp <dig> and cdp <dig> accessions of c. baccatum and cdp <dig> of c. frutescens showed 100% systemically infected plants with absorbances higher than the threshold of each accession  , but no symptoms of systemic infection were detected throughout the survey. these accessions were considered tolerant to pvy-f14k. moreover, cdp <dig> of c. baccatum and cdp <dig> of c. chinense, which showed 60% plants with systemic infection without symptoms, were also considered tolerant. four accessions of c. annuum ,  <dig> of c. chinense  and  <dig> of c. baccatum  showed the best response; no plants were infected systemically  and no symptoms were detected . these accessions were considered resistant to the f14k isolate of potato virus y.

a, arithmetic mean calculated from all plants of the accession at each time sampling. the symptom index ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . b, d: days post inoculation. c, percentage of das-elisa positive plants. plants were considered to be das-elisa positive when absorbance  of sample from the youngest leaf was higher than three times the negative control mean, and classified as non-infected  when the value of absorbance was below this threshold. the negative control mean was calculated for each accession with different time samplings . d, r: resistant. no plants were infected systemically and no symptoms were identified. s: susceptible. showed das-elisa positive and systemic symptoms. t: tolerant. showed das-elisa positive in all or some plants but without symptoms.

discussion
high polymorphism in pepper ecotilling platform
we developed a cdna ecotilling platform for pepper to search for allelic variants of the eif4e and eif4e genes.  <dig> accessions from south america and the canary islands were selected in their primary  or secondary  centres of diversity  <cit> . maximum variability is found within these centres of diversity, which has made it possible to find a high polymorphism in the eif4e and eif4e initiation factors.

 <dig> nucleotide changes were detected in the  <dig> coding sequences of the eif4e gene as well as  <dig> changes in the  <dig> eif4e sequences. our results showed that the pepper accessions used are highly variable. it is possible that cultivated peppers have more genetic variability compared to other crops, such as tomato  <cit> ; but it is also possible that this high variability is due to our selection, based as it is on the diversity centres as opposed to a worldwide selection. the only other ecotilling study with the eif4e gene done in melon found very low diversity  <cit> . only six polymorphic sites were identified in  <dig> accessions of c. melo and one accession of cucumis africanus l. in spite of the fact that our ecotilling assays were only done in exons, our pepper cdna platform has a high level of polymorphism compared to melon, and is similar to other works that use ecotilling in wild or natural species with other genes. comai et al. used  <dig> plants of a. thaliana and discovered  <dig> haplotypes in the five loci analysed  <cit> . in  <dig> natural variants of mla in barley, from five to ten point mutations in  <dig> bp were identified  <cit> . ecotilling has also identified polymorphisms in black cottonwood , and  <dig> snps were identified in  <dig> bp  <cit> . in vigna radiata l., a total of  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels in  <dig> haplotypes from ten primer sets  were detected  <cit> . in common bean ,  <dig> snps were identified in  <dig> est candidates  <cit> , whereas in  <dig> accessions of peanut, eight snps were identified in an amplicon of  <dig> bp  <cit> . therefore, our ecotilling collection has high genetic variation between selected accessions, which could be very useful for identifying natural variation in other genes related to biotic or abiotic responses and quality.

variability of eif4e and eif4e genes in pepper
a total of  <dig> haplotypes of the eif4e gene and  <dig> haplotypes of the eif4e gene were identified. although most of the haplotypes were species-specific, eif4e_b <dig> was detected in c. annuum and c. chinense, eif4e_g <dig> in c. chinense and c. frutescens, eif4e_f <dig> was present in all three of these species and eif4e_b <dig> was present in c. chinense, c. frutescens and c. eximium. this may be due to the genetic flow between the species of the c. annuum complex   <cit> . however, in the case of c. eximium, it is likely due to the presence of ancestral haplotypes, as this species does not cross viably with the others  <cit> .

the  <dig> eif4e nucleotide sequences coded for  <dig> different proteins, and the  <dig> eif4e haplotypes coded for  <dig> eif4e proteins,  <dig> of which were new protein variants. in previous works,  <dig> allelic variants of eif4e proteins in c. annuum  <cit>  and  <dig> allelic variants in c. chinense  <cit>  that coded for  <dig> eif4e proteins were described. the published proteins of c. chinense and three of c. annuum were also identified by ecotilling in our pepper collection. in the case of the eif4e initiation factor, only  <dig> proteins in c. annuum had been previously described  <cit> ; our eif4e_c <dig> haplotype was identical to the published allele, pvr6+. we identified  <dig> new eif4e proteins and  <dig> new eif4e proteins in our pepper collection, but alleles and proteins that had already been described were also identified, confirming that our ecotilling platform contains a good representation of capsicum variability.

we detected  <dig> non-synonymous changes in eif4e haplotypes and  <dig> in eif4e. this high number of amino acid substitutions might be due to the selection and co-evolution of virus and host. in fact, charron et al. described the evidence for co-evolution between eif4e of c. annuum plants and potyviral vpg, as there is a strong evolutionary pressure to resist viral pathogens  <cit> . amino acid changes in the central domain of the pvy-vpg protein have been demonstrated to be subject to positive selection  <cit> . moreover, the existence of positive selection within the recessive resistance gene eif4e has already been described in plants  <cit> .

functionality of new alleles identified by ecotilling
the main objective of ecotilling is to isolate useful new haplotypes or alleles in target genes. thus, the molecular variation in eif4e and eif4e genes could be very useful for identifying new resistance alleles against important viruses in pepper. among the pepper potyviruses, potato virus y is widespread throughout most of the cultivated areas  <cit> . pvy can be transmitted by many species of aphids, but chemical methods are effective enough to control the vector. nevertheless, the impact of this virus has increased due to the restriction of phytosanitary treatments. in recent years, resistance alleles for this virus have not been very important in breeding programs, but now, with the treatment reduction, the use of resistant varieties is the most effective way to prevent damage from the virus. therefore, a screening with pvy-f14k was done to study the response of the new eif4e and eif4e proteins discovered. the f14k isolate of pvy completed the viral cycle in some or all accessions of each analysed species, which indicated that resistance is not species-specific.

we analysed the results according to the protein combinations of eif4e and eif4e . from analysis of the correlation between proteins and disease resistance, we hypothesised that the eif4e proteins were not involved in the resistance to pvy as most of the accession responses could be explained by eif4e proteins. accessions carrying the proteins eif4e_c, eif4e_f, eif4e_g, eif4e_j and eif4e_p generated symptoms, while accessions with the proteins eif4e_m, eif4e_l, eif4e_r and one accession with the eif4e_q protein  and another with eif4e_f  showed systemic infection but were symptomless. other accessions carrying new eif4e proteins found in this study  showed a resistance response as the viral infection was not detected throughout the experiment.

when we compared previous results of the published eif4e proteins, we obtained the expected response in some accessions that contain these eif4e proteins. thus, the accessions with eif4e_e and eif4e_a proteins did not show systematic infection, like the pvr <dig> and pvr <dig> alleles that break the pvy cycle when inoculated  <cit> . the eif4e_i protein was identical to the eif4e protein that carries the pvr <dig> allele that confers broad-spectrum resistance to strains of pvy  <cit> . in spite of this, the cdp <dig> accession  showed a tolerant response, as 3/ <dig> of the plants were das-elisa positive without symptoms. nevertheless, all cdp07700-accession plants blocked viral accumulation at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. different factors may explain the initial viral accumulation in some plants of this accession, such as environmental or experimental factors  or distinct responses to different pvy isolates. all accessions that contain the eif4e_b protein, identical to the pvr2+ susceptible allele  <cit> , showed a susceptible response to pvy-f14k, except the cdp <dig> accession that did not show pvy systemic infection and in which no symptoms were observed. the resistance response of this accession suggests that it is not related to eif4e nor to eif4e, as accessions that carry the same proteins in homozygosis 4e_c or eif4e_d) showed susceptible, tolerant or resistant responses. thus, this response to pvy could be due to another resistance mechanism.

the cdp <dig> accession with the eif4e_f and eif4e_c proteins did not show viral multiplication in all tested plants, unlike the other accession with the same protein variants of both genes, cdp <dig>  the resistance response of the cdp <dig> c. baccatum accession could not be explained by these translation initiation factors. the cdp <dig> accession that carries the eif4e_f and eif4e_a proteins showed a different response compared to other accessions with the same eif4e protein variant. these plants showed systemic infection but were symptomless. nevertheless, in this case, the combination of eif4e_f and eif4e_a could not be ruled out as no accessions with eif4e_a showed a susceptible response. moreover, eif4e_a could also explain the different responses of the accessions with the eif4e_q protein, cdp <dig> and cdp <dig>  nevertheless, this combination hypothesis is unlikely as the eif4e factor was not related to resistance to pvy in the previous works  <cit>  and could only clarify the response of these two latter accessions. in fact, the response of cdp <dig>  cdp <dig>  cdp <dig> and cdp <dig> to pvy-f14k is more easily explained by the presence of another gene or resistant mechanism. for instance, the pvr <dig> anonymous locus of the c. annuum line, criollo de morelos  <dig>  showed a complete dominant resistance to all pvy pathotypes as well as to pepper mottle virus  <cit> .

nine newly identified eif4e proteins seemed to interact with pvy-f14k, but five new eif4e variants  were related to resistance response to this virus. the published resistance alleles of pepper carry different combinations of non-conservative amino acid changes that are localised on the surface of eif4e in regions i  and ii   <cit> . the changes in these regions seem to be responsible for resistance at least against pvy  <cit> . thirteen non-synonymous changes  of the eif4e haplotypes analysed by mechanical inoculation in this survey were previously unknown . seven of the mutations detected by ecotilling in exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the eif4e gene generate a change of charge. six mutations are specific to the new resistance alleles and are localised in exon  <dig> or exon  <dig>  the published proteins eif4e_a  and eif4e_e  have a v67e change , which is sufficient to compromise pvy infection  <cit> . eif4e_n, eif4e_o and eif4e_k of c. baccatum and eif4e_ h of c. chinense have a single amino acid substitution in exon  <dig>  which also may prevent multiplication of the virus. although c. baccatum showed a low susceptibility to pvy-f14k, this mutation may explain the resistance response of some c. baccatum accessions. the other resistant protein, eif4e_d , has other amino acid changes located in regions i , ii  and v . these changes in regions i and ii are also present in other resistance or tolerance eif4e proteins .

the new alleles of the eif4e initiation factor have been named pvr <dig> with a numerical superscript for each new allele based on the latest described allele   <cit> ), using the nomenclature of kyle and palloix  <cit> . the resistance alleles to pvy-f14k, d <dig>  h <dig>  k <dig>  n <dig> and o <dig>  have been designated as pvr <dig>  pvr <dig>  pvr <dig>  pvr <dig> and pvr <dig>  respectively. the new susceptible or tolerant alleles of the eif4e gene, c <dig>  g <dig>  r <dig>  j <dig>  l <dig>  m <dig>  p <dig> and q <dig>  have been designated as pvr <dig>  pvr <dig>  pvr <dig>  pvr <dig>  pvr <dig>  pvr <dig>  pvr <dig> and pvr <dig>  respectively. the new eif4e alleles have been named pvr <dig> with a numerical superscript for the new allele based on the only resistance allele, pvr <dig> . thus, the eif4e alleles that code for a new eif4e protein, a <dig>  b <dig>  d <dig>  e <dig>  f <dig>  h <dig> and k <dig>  have been designated as pvr <dig>  pvr <dig>  pvr <dig>  pvr <dig>  pvr <dig>  pvr <dig> and pvr <dig>  finally, the alleles that code for the eif4e_g protein 4e_g <dig> and eif4e_g2) have been named pvr <dig> 

these five new resistant eif4e alleles, and their possible use in heterozygosis, could make their introgression into new commercial hybrids easier. moreover, these recessive alleles are excellent allele reserves against the changing nature of viral pathogens, as mutations are required in the vpg gene of the pvy to restore its interaction with the different mutated eif4e proteins  <cit> .

the use of cdna as starting material for endonuclease-based ecotilling has not been previously described. however, the cdna-based mutation screening has been described using other technologies, such as hrm  <cit>  or dna sequencing  <cit> . this strategy has several advantages with respect to ecotilling assays based on dna. although ecotilling is a potent technique for discovering snps and examining dna variation in natural populations, one problem is the amplification of target genes from wild species, due to sequence mispriming  <cit> . the use of cdna and primers located in transcribed sequences avoids this problem, as these regions are more conserved. this facilitates the use of sequence data from related and model species. another advantage is that this system avoids the intron sequence, and the complete cds can be amplified in one or two reactions. in dna ecotilling, the presence of introns may be a problem as most of the changes will be located in these regions. to avoid this, an exon-by-exon strategy is usually adopted, requiring as many reactions as there are exons in the candidate gene. in contrast, the cdna ecotilling approach reduces the number of pcr and cel i reactions per sample.

this work is an example of where cdna ecotilling is both cost- and time-effective: it involves different species, only mutations in the cds are of interest and the genes have several highly variable exons. another question is the possibility of using oligo-dt in order to transcribe several genes with the same rt reaction. we used specific primers to improve the efficiency and specificity of the amplification of candidate genes. the expression of the candidate genes in the target tissue has to be previously studied.

one of the essential points of cel i-based ecotilling is the analysis of the band pattern and classification of the samples in relation to it. some factors may make pattern identification in ecotilling assays more difficult. one is experimental variation, as different reactions and denaturing gels make band comparison more difficult. another factor is the differential mismatch preference shown by the endonuclease, cel i  <cit> , which may also be influenced by experimental variance, resulting in different band intensity in different samples. it is of note that this preference was not observed by till et al. using irdye labelling and the li-cor system  <cit> . some factors depend on target sequence, for if there are several mismatches between the samples and the standard sample, the detection of all internal cuts is difficult because the cdna is only labelled at the 5' and 3' terms. thus, the presence of several internal cut sites produces weak bands due to partial digestion. moreover, very close mismatches are very difficult to differentiate by electrophoresis, especially if, due to the number of samples involved, several gels are used. the use of a second standard with a similar or identical sequence reduces these problems and facilitates the correct classification of the samples. these problems, related to accuracy, are not associated with complete cds amplification; even if the analysis is carried out independently for each exon, it is necessary to use a second standard to detect the presence of very close mutations.

thus, to confirm our initial classification, the samples were compared to a new related standard. after the second enzyme reaction, the samples were reclassified and the groups reduced to  <dig> for the eif4e gene and increased to  <dig> for eif4e. nevertheless, after cdna sequencing, the groups were reduced to  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. this discrepancy between cel i groups and sequencing haplotypes is attributable to small differences in band pattern due to experimental variation, the high variability of eif4e and eif4e genes in the selected accessions and the presence of very close mutations. to minimise rare allele loss we designed our double-test protocol and took into account a large number of weak bands, which increased the false positive rate. this explains why most cel i groups were represented by one or two accessions and why some of them showed the same sequence. this would also happen if a genomic dna platform were used. in spite of the number of false positives in our assay, this double test is very efficient in detecting differences between very similar haplotypes. in our analysis, we detected six haplotypes that had been misclassified in the first analysis, one of which resulted in an eif4e allele resistant to pvy-f14k.

this ecotilling platform contains a good representation of capsicum genetic variability and is easy and efficient to test using cel i-based protocols. but this collection is also useful in identifying new nucleotide variations using other techniques, such as direct sequencing with new sequencing systems , high resolution melting  or sensitive capillary electrophoresis . several new approaches based on these techniques have been published  <cit> , and it is very likely that more efficient ngs-based strategies will be developed. for this collection, we have also built up a dna platform in 96-well format available for use. in this new scenario, our pepper platforms with cdna and dna will facilitate and still be useful for the isolation of new mutations and snps related to traits useful in the breeding of these species.

CONCLUSIONS
ecotilling has been optimised in different species of pepper and is the first to use cdna and not genomic dna; this approach avoids intronic sequence problems and reduces the reaction number. we analysed  <dig> accessions looking for allelic variants of the eif4e and eif4e genes. high variability for these initiation factors was detected, which showed a high genetic variation between selected accessions when screened by ecotilling. therefore, genes related to biotic or abiotic responses and quality  are potential targets using our cdna or dna platforms. five new resistance alleles were identified for pvy, and could be introgressed into commercial pepper cultivars to contribute to a more effective and stable resistance to different pvy isolates. this eif4e/eif4e haplotype selection is also a source for searching for new resistance alleles in the fight against other viruses.
