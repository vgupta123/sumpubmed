BACKGROUND
maize is one of the most productive crops worldwide, and is widely used as a model plant in genetics research  <cit> . maize produces two distinct inflorescences, commonly referred to as the tassel and the ear. in this respect, it differs from other grasses such as rice and wheat. the tassel arises from the apex of the mature plant, while ears originate from axillary bud apices  <cit> . one obvious difference in morphology between the two inflorescences is the presence  or absence  of a variable number of long branches originating at the base. in previous studies, the wide range of natural variation among different inbred lines was used to identify quantitative trait loci  underlying a variety of phenotypes by association mapping  <cit> . several genes associated with maize ear development have been identified in genetic and molecular studies  <cit> . however, knowledge about maize ear development is still limited, and most of the genes involved in this process are still unknown.

in plants, small rna-guided post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms play important roles in many aspects of plant biology, including metabolism  <cit> , hormone responses  <cit> , epigenetic control of transposable elements  <cit> , and responses to biotic stress  <cit>  and abiotic stress  <cit> . the two main types of small rnas are micrornas  and small interfering rnas   <cit> . over recent decades, many mirna families have been discovered in plants, and have been shown to regulate more aspects of plant biology than sirnas  <cit> . published reports as well as publicly accessible mirna datasets   <cit> , mainly based on model plants, suggest that mirnas in plants are complex and abundant  <cit> . therefore, identification of mirnas and their targets in diverse species has been a major focus in recent years.

so far, conserved mirnas in maize have been identified by sequence homology analyses  <cit> , and new mirna sequences have been identified by traditional  <cit>  or high-throughput  <cit>  sequencing methods. these mirna sequences can be found in mirbase databases  <cit> . functional analysis has been carried out for only a few maize mirnas, mainly in their role in flower development  <cit> .

there are three main objectives of this study. the first objective is to identify conserved and novel mirnas in maize ears at four different developmental stages. the second objective is to combine publically available arabidopsis thaliana, oryza sativa, sorghum bicolor, and zea mays mirnas data with the new zea mays mirnas data to generate a mirna microarray platform to analyze the dynamics of mirna expression. finally, to discover the targets of conserved and non-conserved mirnas, we aimed to identify the remnants of small rna-directed target cleavage by sequencing the 5′ ends of uncapped rnas using a degradome sequencing approach.

RESULTS
overview over small rna library sequencing
to study the involvement of regulatory mirnas in the complex process of ear development, we profiled mirna accumulation during ear development in the maize inbred line b <dig>  we constructed a maize small rna library using mixed rnas obtained from ears at four different developmental stages. sequencing was conducted on the illumina platform. we obtained more than  <dig>  million raw clean reads, ranging from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt in length. after trimming adaptor sequences and removing contaminated reads, clean reads were aligned against the maize b <dig> refgen v <dig> working gene set using soap <dig> software  <cit> . we found that  <dig> , <dig>  reads matched perfectly to the maize genome, representing  <dig> % of total reads . of the distinct reads,  <dig> % matched with non-coding rnas in rfam and ncbi genbank databases; these non-coding rnas included snornas , snrnas , trnas , rrnas , and sirnas  . the remaining reads were then used to identify conserved and new mirnas. the length of these small rnas ranged from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt. of these, the  <dig> nt category was the most abundant small rna  , followed by  <dig> nt  and  <dig> nt . these were consistent with the typical lengths of plant mature small rnas reported in other studies  <cit> .

computational identification of genuine mirnas during maize ear development
to date, research on identifying conserved and novel mirnas has used several standard methods and databases, including rfam, genbank, and mirbase. because of their low expression levels and sequence depths, it is always difficult to predict mirnas. hence, we used a strict strategy with eight steps to predict and identify known and novel mirnas based on the characteristic features of mirnas specifically processed by dicer-like proteins from canonical stem-loop regions of longer rna precursors  <cit> . we used an integrated strategy combining high-throughput sequencing with bioinformatics analyses to identify mirnas meeting all reported previously criteria   <cit> .

as shown in the schematic diagram of the strategy , our computational analysis generated  <dig> loci folded within typical stem-loop structures . after excluding  <dig> loci that overlapped with protein-coding gene exons,  <dig> loci overlapping transposable elements and other repetitive elements, and  <dig> loci with free energy lower than −20 kcal/mol , the remaining  <dig> loci were considered to be candidate mirna genes. we used miralign to identify paralogs or orthologs of these  <dig> candidate mirna genes by comparing their sequences with those of known mirnas, as described previously  <cit> . from this analysis, we detected  <dig> known mirna genes encoding  <dig> mature mirnas and three mirna star  . we also detected  <dig> novel mirna* sequences .

in plants, it is difficult to identify new mirnas, even when they have the characteristic hairpin feature, because of abundant inverted repeats that can also fold into dysfunctional hairpins  <cit> . thus, we used additional strategies that were not based on phylogenetic conservation to identify non-conserved pre-mirnas. we used mipred  to distinguish pre-mirnas from other similar segments in the maize genome. among the remaining  <dig> candidate pre-mirna-like hairpins,  <dig> were classified as pseudo-pre-mirnas and  <dig> were not pre-mirna-like hairpins. the other  <dig> loci, which encoded  <dig> non-redundant mature mirnas , were identified as maize-specific mirna genes. of these  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> belonged to new families that have not been reported in plants . here, we have designated them in the form of their zma-mir-specific-number, e.g., zma-mirs <dig>  when several maize-specific mirnas belonged to the same family, we named them in a similar manner to that used to name known mature mirnas  <cit>  . all of the new mirna precursors had regular stem-loop structures. we also detected four mirna* , providing further evidence for the existence of this class of mirnas in maize.

characterization of newly identified mirnas in maize
as expected, approximately all  <dig> the conserved mirna families in the small rna library were identified in this study. however, we detected mirna* sequences of zma-mir171h/k and zma-mir408b instead of their corresponding mature mirna sequences . we also identified five mature mirnas  previously predicted by similarity searches  <cit>  and unexpectedly found their corresponding mirna* sequences , which were not available in mirbase. besides the known mirnas, we also identified  <dig> new mirna candidates , and nine  were previously reported  <cit>  . the sequence of mirs <dig> was similar to that of members of the mir <dig> family , indicating that mirs <dig> may be a member of that family. most of the new mirnas could only be produced from one locus. however, zma-mirs6b and four other new mirna genes  could be produced from two or more loci . among the newly identified mirnas, 21-nt mirnas were the most abundant category  . analysis of the nucleotide sequences of these mirnas revealed that uridine  was the most common nucleotide at the 5′ end  , and the 10th and 11th nucleotides, which match to the cleavage site of targets, were usually adenine . also, u was the most common nucleotide at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in these mirnas.

next, we conducted microarray assays to analyze expressions of the known and newly identified mirnas during maize ear development. we detected transcripts of all of the conserved mirnas and  <dig> out of  <dig>  maize-specific mirnas in the microarray experiment. those that were undetected either had a low affinity to the chip probes or very low transcript levels  . these results suggest that solexa sequencing is a more specific and efficient tool than the mirna microarray assay for identifying mature mirnas. in our study, we detected six mirna families  in the microarray assay that were not present in the solexa sequencing data . these mirnas need to be further validated.

although we identified  <dig> mirnas  and  <dig> mirna*s, they showed a diverse range of abundance, and only a few mirna families dominated in the mirna library and microarray assay data. the six most abundantly expressed mirna families were mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mirs <dig>  there were extremely low frequencies of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mirs <dig>  and mirs <dig>  possibly because these families are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. most of the mirna*s showed very low transcript levels , much lower than those of their homoplastic mirnas, consistent with previous findings  <cit> . the transcript level of zma-mir408b was lower than that of zma-mir408b*, and the mature product from the 3′ arm of the hairpin suggested that the 3′ arm may be functional.

expression profiles of known and newly identified mirnas
to analyze mirna expression during maize ear development, we analyzed the mirna expression profiles of ear samples collected at four different developmental stages using microarray assays. conserved mature mirnas are generally conserved among plant species and are stably expressed in diverse tissues. however, when microarray technology is used to analyze expression, members of the same mirna family with 1– <dig> nt sequence differences need to be normalized for further analyses because hybridization can occur between members of the same mirna family across different species  <cit> . hence, a total of  <dig> mirnas, about  <dig> %  of the probes on the microarray, were identified as putative differentially expressed mirnas  . of these,  <dig> mirnas aligned with  <dig> members of  <dig> maize mirna families, while the others corresponded to members of mirna families from three other plant species, including rice  arabidopsis  and sorghum . the results shown in additional file 10: figure s <dig> indicated that the differentially expressed mirnas may be specially regulated in diverse pathways during ear development. a sample of  <dig> expressed mirnas was randomly selected for validation by stem-loop qrt-pcr. the trends in the expression of these mirnas detected by microarray experiments were consistent  or partially  consistent with those determined in stem-loop qrt-pcr analyses .

target prediction of conserved and non-conserved mirnas by degradome sequencing
to identify small rna targets at a global level in maize, we used the recently developed degradome library sequencing technology  <cit> . we generated four libraries from maize ears at different developmental stages  as described above. high-throughput sequencing yielded  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig> , <dig> , and  <dig> , <dig>  20-nt sequences representing the 5′ ends of uncapped, poly-adenylated rnas for stages i to iv, respectively. the total number of signatures matching to the genome was  <dig> , <dig> for stage i,  <dig> , <dig> for stage ii,  <dig> , <dig> for stage iii, and  <dig> , <dig> for stage iv. the number of distinct sequences in the four libraries matching to the genome was  <dig> , <dig>  for stage i,  <dig> , <dig>  for stage ii,  <dig>   for stage iii, and  <dig> , <dig>  for stage iv. the number of signatures that matched to only one location in the genome was relatively high:  <dig>   for stage i,  <dig> , <dig>  for stage ii,  <dig>   for stage iii, and  <dig> , <dig>  for stage iv, suggesting that 20-nt signatures are sufficient to identify their origin in the maize genome. of these,  <dig>  ,  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig>   and  <dig> , <dig>  distinct signatures for stage i, ii, iii, and iv, respectively, could be mapped to annotated maize gene models . a small proportion of the distinct signatures  could also be mapped to the maize chloroplast or mitochondrial genomes. the number of distinct signatures matching to rrnas, trnas, small nucleolar rnas  or small nuclear rnas was  <dig>   for stage i,  <dig>   for stage ii,  <dig>   for stage iii, and  <dig>   for stage iv. these were removed before subsequent analyses . similarly, we removed the sequences matching to repeats/transposons that were revealed by searches against the repeat database . interestingly, a significant proportion of distinct signatures from the four libraries matched to introns and intergenic regions, similar to the findings of previous transcript profiling analyses  <cit> .

based on previous studies, a characteristic scenario of mirna-guided slicing is that the cleavage takes place precisely between the 10th and 11th nt from the 5′ end of mirna in the complementary region of the target transcript  <cit> . we used cleaveland pipeline  <cit>  to identify sliced mirna targets in the maize transcriptome. various sequenced tags were plotted on each of the target transcripts . the cleaved target transcripts were categorized into five classes  as reported previously for arabidopsis <cit> , grapevine  <cit> , rice  <cit> , and soybean  <cit> .

for conserved mirnas and ta-sirnas,  <dig> target genes  were identified in ears at the four stages of development . reads associated with most of these mirna targets were over-represented . however, only 15% of the mirna targets  were identified in all four stages. the targets were classified into categories 0– <dig> based on the abundance of degradome tags indicative of mirna-mediated cleavage. in stage i, ii, iii, and iv, there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> targets classified as category  <dig>   <cit> . there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> targets in stage i, ii, iii, and iv, respectively, classified as category  <dig> . in stage i, ii, iii, and iv, there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> targets classified as category  <dig> . in stage i, ii, iii, and iv there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> target transcripts classified as category  <dig> . all other transcripts were classified as category  <dig> . only  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> targets in stage i, ii, iii, and iv, respectively, were in category  <dig>  among the identified targets, category  <dig> was the most abundant category among the four degradome libraries .

we identified target genes for almost all of the  <dig> conserved mirna families. the conserved mirnas were able to target various numbers of genes, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  among the conserved mirna families, zma-mir <dig> and zma-mir <dig> had the highest number of gene targets. zma-mir <dig> targeted  <dig> unique genes including spl genes and zma-mir <dig> targeted  <dig> unique genes including zcn <dig>  , indicating that these two families might play key roles in ear development  <cit> . most of the conserved mirnas targeted multiple gene loci. their gene targets were members of different families of transcription factors, such as sbp-box transcription factor, auxin response factor , tcp, myb, bzip, ap <dig>  and gras. we also identified  <dig> new target genes of conserved mirnas in maize . among the  <dig> mirna target genes,  <dig>  had been predicted previously  <cit> ,  <dig>  cross-validated with other degradome libraries prepared from plants under different stress conditions  <cit> , and  <dig> have been validated by 5′-race and/or genetic experiments  <cit> . the targets of conserved mirnas were highly abundant in the four sequenced target libraries, and were often classified as category  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> targets . for instance, mir <dig> targeted seven different ccaat-binding transcription factors in the four stages  with very high abundance, but it also guided the slicing of three other non-conserved targets with very low abundance. interestingly, some target transcripts were regulated by pairs of mirnas: both mir <dig> and mir <dig> targeted five members of the same sbp family, and the mir159/ <dig> pair regulated three myb domain transcription factors. this result suggested that there is complex regulation of these genes by these mirna pairs, consistent with the findings of a previous study  <cit>  .

out of  <dig> non-conserved zma-mirnas including  <dig> new mirnas with four corresponding mirna*, we identified targets for only seven mirnas . we used absolute numbers to plot the cleavages on target mrnas; this was referred to as a target plot  by german et al. <cit> . except for mirs <dig>  the targets mostly belonged to category  <dig> or  <dig> with very low abundance, which differed from the targets of conserved mirnas . four identified targets of mirs <dig>  were the same as those of mir <dig>  providing further evidence that mirs <dig> is a member of the mir <dig> family.

go analysis of targets regulated by differentially expressed mirnas
in our study, we predicted  <dig> genes  for  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas from  <dig> mirna families. more than 90% of these mirnas had putative functions . 73% of these differentially expressed mirna families played an important role in post-transcriptional regulation by targeting mrnas encoding transcription factors in sbp, arf, gras, and ap <dig> families . go analysis revealed that the target genes were involved in a wide spectrum of regulatory functions and biological processes including regulation of transcription, dna binding, response to hormone stimulus, nucleic acid metabolic process, gene expression, cellular macromolecule synthesis, and cellular nitrogen compound metabolism. this was consistent with the fact that the small rna and the degradome libraries for mirna sequence analysis were constructed from developing maize ears . in addition, a specific feature of our study was that we found more genes in families involved in metabolic process, biological regulation, cellular biosynthetic process, and nucleic acid binding function at the later stages of maize ear development . the accumulation of dry matter such as starch and saccharides is the main event in ear development, and a large number of target genes may participate in this pathway. the differentially expressed mirnas may regulate expression of these target genes to control ear development and biomass yield in maize.

discussion
small rnas play important roles in gene regulation in plants  <cit> . in this study, we have annotated mirna genes based on the complete assembly of the maize genome. in total,  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> new mirnas were identified in maize ears by deep sequencing. this confirmed previous results reported by zhang et al.  <cit> . these newly identified mirnas may belong to lineage-specific families, and showed little or no expression at the mirna level. we identified  <dig> mirnas as differentially expressed mirnas by microarray assays.

the recently reported high-throughput experimental approach  <cit>  allowed us to create a detailed mirna: target interaction atlas for maize. in the current work, we identified a total of  <dig> genes  targeted by  <dig> small rnas including  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> ta-sirnas . among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> were cross-validated in other degradome libraries  <cit> , by 5′-race, and/or by genetic experiments  <cit> , showing that degradome sequencing is a powerful tool for identifying targets regulated by mirnas. surprisingly, most highly conserved mirnas were detectable in maize ears at all four developmental stages , but sliced targets were not detected at all stages . it is possible that the differentially expressed mirnas regulate both the spatial pattern and the level of target mrna expression, as previously demonstrated in some cases  <cit> . it is equally possible that this represents a limitation of degradome sequencing. results can be affected by many unpredictable factors such as ligation efficiency, pcr bias, etc. there were  <dig> target genes of  <dig> conserved mirna families. among the target genes,  <dig> % encoded transcription factors . these targets were not only conserved families, such as sbp, myb, arf, bzip , nac, gras, ap <dig>  and tcp transcription factor gene families, but also non-conserved genes encoding metallophosphoesterase, dicer-like <dig>  no apical meristem  proteins, and phd finger proteins. the conserved targets may participate in maize ear development. we also identified  <dig> genes targeted by non-conserved mirnas. one arf gene and three dna-binding transcription factor genes cleaved by ta-sirnas were also identified . the conserved mirnas silenced more targets than did maize-specific mirnas. it is possible that conserved mirnas play a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation in different plant species  <cit> . however, maize-specific mirnas may function only to regulate gene expression during gramineae- or maize-specific biological processes. although conserved mirnas mainly regulate genes encoding transcription factors, maize-specific mirnas are considered to be young mirnas that have evolved recently, and are often expressed at lower levels than conserved mirnas  <cit> .

previous studies showed that mir <dig> and mir <dig> function throughout flower development from the earliest stages  to very late stages   <cit> . mir156a-l probably targets several spl genes during the juvenile-to-adult phase transition in maize , and is postulated to indirectly activate mir <dig> via spl <cit> . mir <dig> has been shown to negatively regulate gl <dig> , which promotes maintenance of the juvenile state  <cit> . the levels of mir <dig> and mir <dig> are conflicting during phase transition . meanwhile, mir172e likely controls ids <dig> and sid <dig>  which are responsible for maize spikelet sex determination and meristem cell fate  <cit> , by both translational repression and mrna degradation . beyond mir <dig> and mir <dig>  mir <dig> targets genes encoding nam proteins, and may be involved in regulating ear development , similar to how mir <dig> is postulated to regulate nac-domain targets in arabidopsis  <cit> . although most mirna families appear to target a single class of targets, the mir159/ <dig> family regulates both myb and tcp transcription factors, which may control petal morphogenesis as previously reported  <cit> .

some mirnas have been shown to be involved the signaling pathway that mediates responses to the phytohormone auxin. for example, mir <dig> targets four auxin response factor  genes, and mir <dig> targets six arf genes. in addition to the mirnas mentioned above, one mirna family  targets a gene central to mirna genesis; the differentially expressed zma-mir <dig> targets dicer-like <dig> , a homolog of dcl <dig> in arabidopsis that is required for mirna accumulation  <cit> . in summary, genome-wide identification of all targets provided useful information to explore the functions of mirnas in maize.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have confirmed the expression of conserved, known non-conserved and new maize mirnas using high-throughput approaches to better understand the role of mirnas in developmental maize ears. besides, we have identified  <dig> target genes of both known and new mirnas and ta-sirnas using recently developed tools for the global identification of mirna targets. specifically,  <dig> genes  targeted by  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas from  <dig> mirna families may play important roles in ear development in maize. maize represents a model for cultivated crop plants. as these characters are quite different for other model plants , we expect to discover new roles of mirnas in post-transcriptional regulation. we also provided some evidence of the important function of mirnas in regulating developmental process. identification and characterization of this important class of regulatory genes in maize may improve our understanding of molecular mechanism controlling maize ear development.
