BACKGROUND
tek or tie- <dig> is the receptor tyrosine kinase  for the angiopoietin family of ligands . the role of tie- <dig> in endothelial cells has been extensively studied over the years, and the discovery of impaired lymphatic vessel patterning and function in angiopoietin- <dig>  knockout mice has since added extra complexity to this growing field  <cit> . tie- <dig> has also been shown to be expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells  <cit> . in vivo studies using slow-release pellets of an engineered form of ang <dig>  cartilage oligomeric matrix protein-angiopoietin- <dig> , have further showed induction of angiogenesis and ectopic lymphangiogenesis in mouse cornea  <cit> . in addition, over-expression of ang <dig> in the skin of mouse ears via recombinant adeno-associated virus gene delivery induced lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation, lymphatic vessel enlargement, sprouting, and branching  <cit> .

prior to the discovery of the involvement of tie- <dig> and its ligands in lymphangiogenesis, the role of tie- <dig> and it ligands in angiogenesis was the focus of mouse genetic studies. ang <dig> deficient mice exhibited phenotypes similar to those of tie- <dig> knockout mice. these phenotypes included impaired myocardial trabeculation and endocardial development as well as lack of perivascular recruitment to endothelial cells undergoing angiogenesis  <cit> . ang <dig> was initially characterized as an ang <dig> competitive antagonist since transgenic over-expression of ang <dig> produced angiogenic defects resembling those of ang <dig> or tie- <dig> knockout mice  <cit> .

in recent studies, evidence suggesting condition-dependent agonistic roles for ang <dig> brought into question the initial characterization of ang <dig> as simply a competitive antagonist of ang <dig>  ang <dig> has been shown to activate tie- <dig> phosphorylation at high concentrations leading to cell survival via the akt signalling pathway  <cit> . following a 24-hour pre-treatment, ang <dig> can lead to vessel growth in a fibrin matrix model  <cit> . ang <dig> can also induce tubule formation in murine brain capillaries and promote endothelial cell migration  <cit> . in addition to inhibiting jnk/sapk phosphorylation, ang <dig> has been shown to induce phosphorylation of tie- <dig>  akt, erk1/ <dig>  and p <dig> members of the mitogen activated protein kinases in the human umbilical vein endothelial cells   <cit> . other functions of ang <dig> in vasculogenesis include promotion of endothelial cell  adhesion independently of tie- <dig>  <cit> , regulation of differentiation of cells surrounding the cortical peritubular capillaries of the kidneys  <cit> , and modulation of retinal and hyaloid blood vessel remodelling  <cit> .

complementing these studies were mouse knockout experiments that further elucidated the impotance of ang <dig> in endothelial cell function. ang2-null mice  exhibited defects in the hyaloid blood vasculature and gross defects in lymphatic remodelling  <cit> . skin oedema in ang2-null mice correlated with improper recruitment of support cells such as smooth muscle cells responsible for the contractile function of lymphangions in peripheral or dermal lymphatic vessels  <cit> . the ang2-null mice also developed lethal chylous ascites and edema in the peritoneal cavity around day  <dig>  correlating with improperly remodelled lacteals in villi, disorganization and hypoplasia of intestinal lymphatic capillaries, and deficient smooth muscle association in mesenteric-collecting lymphatic vessels  <cit> . the function of ang <dig> is therefore not limited to antagonistic regulation of ang <dig> in tie- <dig> signalling.

in this study, we demonstrate that bovine mesenteric venous, arterial, and lymphatic endothelial cells  responded differentially to ang <dig> and ang <dig>  firstly, both ang <dig> and ang <dig> activated tie- <dig> and downstream erk1/ <dig> in bmlec. however, whereas ang <dig> promoted migration in bmlecs, ang <dig> slightly more effectively promoted proliferation and survival in these cells. secondly, ang <dig> more effectively activated tie- <dig> and downstream erk1/ <dig> in bmvecs and bmaecs than did ang <dig>  however, whereas ang <dig> promoted survival, and migration in bmvecs and bmaecs, ang <dig> did not stimulate the same responses in these cells. whereas ang <dig> produced a small proliferative response in bmaecs, neither ang <dig> nor ang <dig> produced a proliferative response in bmvecs. taken together, our results suggest cellular responses to ang <dig> and ang <dig> stimulation vary depending on the origin of the endothelial cells.

RESULTS
bmlec isolation and culture
in order to distinguish translucent lymphatic vessels from surrounding fatty tissue, evan's blue dye was injected into exposed mesenteric lymph nodes. the blue staining of post-nodal lymphatic vessels facilitated excision and processing of the vessels to extract endothelial cells. blood vessels remained red after dye injection  and therefore could not be mistaken for lymphatic vessels. initial cultures of cells extracted from dispase- and collagenase-treated excised bovine mesentery lymphatic vessels were at least 50% endothelial based on cellular morphology. cells cultured from treated vessels were a mixture of smooth muscle cells , fibroblasts, and cobblestoned bmlecs.

unlike high-purity endothelial cell populations, a mixed cell population did not form a cobblestone monolayer when grown to confluency . the morphologies of the different cells within the mixed population were visually distinguishable. a mixed population of predominantly smcs, fibroblasts, and a few bmlecs formed circular "swirly" patterns . this morphology has previously been described by leak and jones, and johnston and walker  <cit> . populations of cells that predominantly consisted of fibroblasts  or smcs  had distinct morphologies unlike the cobblestoned appearance of bmlec at confluency .

to obtain purity greater than 90%, contaminating smcs and fibroblasts were eliminated from the culture by direct aspiration, differential trypsinization, and by limited dilution. resulting cultures of the primary cells bmlecs had doubling times of approximately  <dig> hours , consistent with doubling times reported by leak and jones  <cit> . these bmlecs were robust and could be frozen and thawed within  <dig> passages.

previously, leak and jones  <cit>  described the spontaneous formation of lymphatic tube structures in vitro from confluent monolayer of lymphatic endothelial cells. we also observed the formation of these tubes in 96-well plates of bmlec cell populations left at confluency for at least a few weeks . cells at the ends of the tubes attached to and migrated up the sidewalls of the tissue culture wells . the formation of lymphatic tubular structures in culture indicated that extracted bmlecs maintain lymphatic phenotypic character.

comparing bmlecs to bmvecs, and to bmaecs
in essence, the strategy used to isolate bmlecs was also used to isolate bmaecs and bmvecs. dye injection was unnecessary since large mesenteric arteries and veins were discernable from surrounding fatty tissue, unlike milky white lymphatic vessels. arteries were thick-walled vessels that were easily distinguished from slightly larger and thin-walled veins. cultured bmlecs, bmvecs, and bmaecs exhibited the same cobblestoned monolayer morphology at confluency , although the packing of cells together was somewhat different. after the formation of the confluent monolayer, bmaecs, bmvecs, and bmlecs continued to grow at different rates to form tighter-packed monolayer . bmaecs grew fastest at this stage and formed the densest monolayer. bmaecs were followed by bmvecs, which formed the second densest monolayer. bmlecs grew at the slowest rate at this stage and formed the least dense monolayer .

staining the cells with fluorescent phalloidin revealed that the arrangement of actin microfilaments in each cell type appeared similar to each other, typically with dense peripheral bands of actin filaments, and prominent stress fibers throughout the cytoplasm . however there seemed to be some qualitative differences in the intracellular distribution of these actin filaments. there were extensive dense peripheral bands of actin, with relatively few stress fibers in bmvecs, whereas stress fibers were more prominent in bmaecs. in contrast, bmlecs seemed to have an intermediate combination of both actin filament arrangements .

upon achieving confluency, apart from differences in cell packing, bmlecs were indistinguishable from bmvecs and bmaecs by phase contrast microscopy alone . however, using gene-specific primers and reverse transcriptase-pcr analysis, and using antibodies specific for prox- <dig>  lyve- <dig>  or podoplanin and immunofluorescence, we were able to demonstrate that these endothelial cell preparations retained their lineage-specific properties in culture. all three cell preparations expressed tie- <dig> and tie- <dig> , whereas bmlecs but not blood ecs expressed vegfr- <dig>  and prox- <dig> . immunofluorescence also showed bmlecs to express lyve- <dig> and podoplanin , both of which have been shown to be specific markers of lymphatic endothelial cells  <cit> . furthermore, bmaecs and not bmvecs expressed neuropilin- <dig>  which has been shown to be a specific arterial endothelial cell marker  <cit>  .

activation of tie- <dig> in bmecs by ang2
in order to ensure tie- <dig> in bovine cells is sufficiently similar to human tie- <dig> to be stimulated with human angiopoietin ligands, amino acid sequences of bovine, mouse, and human tie- <dig> were aligned with clustalw . protein sequence alignment of human, mouse and bovine tie- <dig> indicated 95% identity between bovine and human sequences and 92% identity between mouse and human, or mouse and bovine sequences. more importantly, the residues found by barton et al.  <cit>  to be important for the interaction of tie- <dig> with ang <dig> were conserved across the three species , and all tyrosine residues in the kinase domain were perfectly conserved . based on this observation, bovine endothelial cells should be highly suitable for stimulation with human ligands.

the tie- <dig> receptor protein levels were greatest in bmaecs, whereas the levels in bmvecs and bmlecs were lower ). once the differences in expression levels of tie- <dig> in each cell were accounted for, activation of tie- <dig> as judged by its autophosphorylation by ang <dig>  relative to basal autophosphorylation level , was highest in bmlecs, and was considerably lower in bmaecs and bmvecs . clustered ang <dig>  which we have previously demonstrated is the most potent form of ang <dig>  <cit> , stimulated the activation of tie- <dig> in all three cell types above basal levels . of note, the level of phosphorylation of tie- <dig> due to ang <dig> stimulation as compared to the level due to ang <dig> stimulation was the same in bmlecs but different in bmaecs and bmvecs .

studies of huvec and capillary endothelial cell systems have shown that ang <dig> and ang <dig> stimulation resulted in the activation of extracellularly regulated kinase or erk1/ <dig>  <cit> . in our endothelial cell system, whereas endogenous protein levels of erk1/ <dig> were not different in bmlecs, bmvecs and bmaecs, active phosphorylated erk 1/ <dig>  levels were quite different. mock-treated bmvecs contained high amounts of phospho-erk, whose levels increased slightly upon ang <dig> stimulation . ang <dig> stimulation of bmvecs did not activate erk1/ <dig> according to phosphorylation levels of the protein . although bmaecs had relative low basal levels of phospho-erk in the mock-treated sample, these cells responded in a similar fashion as bmvecs to ang <dig> stimulation. phospho-erk levels were increased above basal levels upon ang <dig> stimulation, but not upon ang <dig> stimulation in bmaecs . in contrast to bmaecs and bmvecs, stimulation of bmlecs with either ang <dig> or ang <dig> resulted in an increase in phospho-erk levels, although ang <dig> seemed to provide a more potent signal .

in order to ascertain whether the autophosphorylation of tie- <dig> detected in these immunoblots reflected ligand-dependent activation of tie- <dig> and not just phosphorylation by another kinase, we immunoblotted membranes from bmlecs stimulated with ang <dig> with an activation-specific antibody directed to phosphotyrosine  <dig>  phosphorylation of tyrosine  <dig> has been shown to reflect activation of kinase activity in tie- <dig>  <cit> . tie- <dig> was phosphorylated at this residue when bmlecs were stimulated with ang <dig> , indicating that kinase activity of the tyrosine receptor was activated.

bmlec proliferation is enhanced by ang <dig> and ang2
blood vasculature endothelial proliferation in response to growth factors is considered a key angiogenic response. in the study of lymphangiogenesis, angiogenesis-related assays would need to be adapted to the study of key lymphangiogenic responses of lymphatic endothelial cells such as proliferation. thus, we tested the response of bmlecs to different proliferative factors. 3h-thymidine uptake assays of bmlecs stimulated with vegf-a <dig>  vegf-cc156s, bfgf, egf  demonstrated that all of the growth factors to varying degrees stimulated thymidine upatke in bmlec. the greatest response of bmlecs was to bfgf and vegf-cc156s  confirming the phenotypic fidelity of bmlecs in vitro.

studies have shown that ang <dig> stimulation results in the activation of erk1/ <dig>  <cit> . ang <dig> has also been shown to stimulate proliferation of endothelial cells  <cit> . to determine whether ang <dig> and ang <dig> had differential effects on the proliferation of different types of endothelial cells, we tested the levels of thymidine uptake of the three bmecs in the presence of ang <dig> and ang <dig> . although the basal proliferative activity of each cell preparation was somewhat varied: highest in bmaecs, lower in bmvecs, and lowest in bmlecs , the differential responses of the cells to these angiogenic factors relative to control levels was detectable. bmvecs did not respond to either ang <dig> or ang <dig>  whereas bmaecs responded best to ang <dig> stimulation . in contrast, bmlecs responded to both ang <dig> and ang <dig> but best to ang2-stimulation . these results suggest that endothelial cell type influences proliferative responses to either ang <dig> or ang <dig> 

in order to make sure ang <dig> and ang <dig> stimulation did not increase thymidine uptake in bmlecs independently of cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation, we performed cell count experiments . we also performed cell count experiments for bmvecs and bmaecs with both ligands to ensure reproducibility of the thymidine uptake data . consistent with the trends shown by thymidine uptake assays, ang <dig> and ang <dig> both provided proliferative signals to bmlecs, increasing bmlec numbers over the 96-hour period of the assay . furthermore, consistent with thymidine uptake results, ang <dig> was marginally more effective than ang <dig> in increasing cell counts of bmlecs, although the result was not statistically significant . however, ang <dig> and ang <dig> increased bmlec cell counts significantly above mock levels indicating that both ang <dig> and ang <dig> were mitogenic for bmlecs .

consistent with thymidine uptake results, neither ang <dig> nor ang <dig> provided proliferative signals to bmvecs . neither ligand increased cell counts of bmvecs above mock levels over the 96-hour period . in contrast and consistent with the trends shown by the thymidine uptake results, ang <dig> provided a small proliferative signal to bmaecs, whereas ang <dig> did not increase bmaec cell counts above mock levels over the 96-hour period . taken together, these cell count results indicate that whether ang <dig> and ang <dig> are mitogenic depends on endothelial cell type.

ang <dig> promotes bmec migration
endothelial cell migration is another well-accepted criterion for the angiogenic response. ang <dig> has previously been shown to induce cell migration, whereas ang <dig> has previously been shown not to drive the migration of huvecs  <cit> . using a modified boyden chamber assay we tested the ability of ang <dig> and ang <dig> to drive migration of these three cell types. we found that ang <dig> did not promote migration of these cells whereas ang <dig> was able to drive endothelial cell migration . these results suggest that although bmlecs, bmvecs, and bmaecs responded differentially to ang <dig> and ang <dig> in proliferative assays, they responded similarly to chemoattractant effects of ang <dig> 

ang <dig> protects bmlec from cell death
many angiogenic factors are known to protect ecs from serum-deprivation-induced cellular apoptosis . ang <dig> has previously been shown by numerous groups including ours to protect huvec from apoptosis  <cit> . however, a role for ang2-mediated ec survival remains unclear. results of some studies suggested that ang <dig> counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of ang <dig> and leads to cell death  <cit> . results of other studies suggested that ang <dig> mediates a pi3-kinase-dependent cell survival signal  <cit> . to investigate the role of ang <dig> in serum-deprivation-induced cell death, we tested the ability of ang <dig> or ang <dig> to promote cell survival on the three cell preparations. ang <dig> protected bmvecs and bmaecs from cell death, whereas it had minimal effect on bmlecs . in contrast ang <dig> had virtually no effect on bmvecs and a marginal effect on bmaecs . interestingly, ang <dig> produced a dramatic survival response in bmlecs . together with results from survival and proliferation assays , these results further suggest that the origin of endothelial cells dramatically influences angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis-related responses to either ang <dig> or ang <dig>

discussion
in this study, we set out to examine whether the type of ec could affect its response to ang <dig> or ang <dig>  we prepared ecs from lymphatic, venous and arterial vessels taken from bovine mesentery and subjected them to numerous angiogenesis-related in vitro assays. our results demonstrate that the activation of tie- <dig> by ang <dig> stimulation was as effective as by ang <dig> stimulation in bmlecs. in bmvecs and bmaecs, ang <dig> stimulation was more effective than ang <dig> in activating tie- <dig> in bmvecs and bmaecs. the activation of tie- <dig> in all three cell types by ang <dig> or in bmlecs by ang <dig> correlated with the activation of erk1/ <dig>  ang <dig> activated erk1/ <dig> in all three cell types, whereas ang <dig> only activated erk1/ <dig> in bmlecs. of note, ang <dig> seemed to be a more potent activator of erk1/ <dig> than ang <dig> in bmlecs. these results suggest erk1/ <dig> is a downstream signalling pathway of tie <dig> in endothelial cells. although ang <dig> stimulation correlated with erk1/ <dig> activation in all three cells, ang <dig> did not promote proliferation in all three cell types but only weakly in bmaecs and bmlecs . unlike bmvecs, both bmaecs and bmlecs had low levels of basal phosphorylated erk1/ <dig> levels in the mock samples. this finding suggests that the proliferative response of bmlecs to ang- <dig> stimulation may not be solely under the regulation of erk1/ <dig> downstream of tie- <dig>  complex cell-type specific mechanisms present in the endothelial cells suppress the proliferative signal from ang <dig> in bmvecs, but promote the weak proliferative responses in bmlec and bmaecs.

likewise, additional cell-specific mechanisms may be present in blood endothelial cells that suppress the proliferative and survival signals from ang <dig>  but are present in lymphatic endothelial cells to promote the proliferative and survival signals from ang <dig>  this was implied by our findings that ang <dig> was not a proliferative signal for bmaecs or bmvecs but only for bmlecs. similarly, ang <dig> did not strongly support serum-free survival of bmvecs and bmaecs but significantly promoted the survival of bmlecs . of note, the level of erk1/ <dig> activation stimulated by ang <dig> in bmlecs was lower than the level stimulated by ang <dig>  which did not provide as potent a proliferative or survival signal as ang <dig> in bmlecs. in summary, our data shows that endothelial cells of different origin have different sets of cellular responses to ang <dig> and ang <dig> stimulation, suggesting that ang <dig> and ang <dig> activate distinct sets of signalling molecules in the signalling cascades of endothelial cells of different origin. thus, we recommend the consideration of ang <dig> as a full agonist in endothelial cells of lymphatic origin, but a partial agonist in endothelial cells of blood origin. since ang <dig> and ang <dig> also elicited slightly different responses from bmaecs and bmvecs in our study , the subtype of endothelial cells of blood origin need to be taken into consideration in future studies of ang <dig> and ang <dig> signalling and function.

until recently, ang <dig> was thought to be an ang <dig> competitive antagonist. this conclusion was made based on the finding that transgenic over-expression of ang <dig> produced blood vasculature defects resembling those of ang <dig> or tie- <dig> knockout mutants  <cit> . ang <dig> competitively blocked activation of tie- <dig> by ang <dig> but ang <dig> was equally as effective as ang <dig> in activating tie- <dig> phosphorylation in nih 3t <dig> fibroblasts ectopically expressing tie- <dig>  <cit> . this finding suggested that endothelial cells have additional components that allow functional discrimination between the two angiopoietin  <cit> . our findings clearly indicates that the additional components suggested by these initial studies of ang <dig> are endothelial cell-type specific and may be responsible for the agonistic activities of ang <dig> in lymphatic endothelial cells. although there are some functional redundancies, each angiopoietin may be driving a distinct set of cellular events within a specific type of endothelial cell.

ang <dig> induction has been shown to associate with progression and prognosis of a variety of human cancers. high expression of ang <dig> in malignant tissue correlates with poor survival rate, and/or high frequency of metastasis, and/or high microvascular density  in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma, breast cancer, gastric carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma , non-small cell lung cancer , prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer  <cit> . in contrast, expression of ang <dig> in these tumours was often found to be at comparatively low to undetectable levels. these studies implicate ang <dig> as a potentially potent target of anti-angiogenic cancer therapy. in fact, blocking ang <dig> activity by antibodies and specific peptide inhibitors has been efficacious in suppressing tumour growth and reducing endothelial cell proliferation in mice  <cit> .

this evidence suggests that ang <dig> is not simply a "context-dependent antagonist/agonist" of tie- <dig> signalling; ang <dig> can also be a potentially effective candidate target of therapy for pathological conditions involving both angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, such as cancer metastasis. importantly, drug designs intended to target ang2- while avoiding ang1-mediated signalling may produce fewer side effects. this point lends justification to further intensive studies to characterize the cell-type specific mechanisms responsible for differential responsiveness to ang <dig> and ang <dig> stimulation in angiogenesis as well as in lymphangiogenesis. cells systems such as the one described in this study would be useful tools in this endeavour.

historically, the angiogenesis field has advanced faster and farther than that of lymphangiogenesis. the discovery of lymphatic markers and the emerging evidence implicating the lymphatic system's central role in a variety of pathological conditions has attracted research interest and driven the field forward. one important question emerges as researchers are confronted with the design of pharmaceuticals in enhancing or mitigating lymphangiogenesis: whether it is possible to specifically target one vascular system without adversely compromising the functions of other vascular system when there is evidence of shared molecular regulators such as the angiopoietins behaving differently in the two systems. addressing this important question requires in vitro systems such as the one described here, that allows simultaneous characterization of the signalling pathways downstream of the angiopoietins in each of the three cell types: venous, arterial and lymphatic endothelial cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we have isolated primary endothelial cells from lymphatic , vein , and arterial  vessels of bovine mesentery. the cells express specific markers of their respective lineages, and were used to test the hypothesis that endothelial cell type determined cellular response such as proliferation, migration, and survival to ang <dig> and ang <dig> stimulation. we found that indeed, while ang <dig> was a chemoattractant for all three cells, ang <dig> was a more potent survival signal than ang <dig> in bmaec and bmvec. in contrast, ang <dig> was a more potent survival and proliferative signal than ang <dig> in bmlecs. our data suggests that each endothelial cell type possesses a unique repertoire of signalling proteins that allows that cell type to differentially respond to the angiopoietins.
