BACKGROUND
pharmacophore methods are widely used in drug discovery research projects  <cit> . as defined in the international union of pure and applied chemistry  glossary of terms  <cit> , a pharmacophore describes chemical features and their spatial arrangement in active molecules and targets involved in specific biochemical interactions. several software tools provide solutions for pharmacophore modelling and generation, including accelrys discovery studio  <cit> , ligandscout  <cit> , zincpharmer  <cit> .

pairwise comparison of pharmacophores requires defining a similarity metric. generally, there are two categories of similarity measurements: alignment-dependent methods and alignment-independent methods  <cit> . alignment-independent methods usually target binary fingerprint descriptors, such as 3-point pharmacophore fingerprints  <cit>  or 4-point pharmacophore fingerprints  <cit> . they calculate similarities with measurements such as the tanimoto similarity . alignment-dependent methods  <cit> , in most of the cases, are based on shape or shape plus pharmacophore similarity measurements. superimposition or overlays are widely used in this category of methods. however, chemical information is typically not involved in the shape-based methods. the openeye  <cit>  colour-tanimoto is an exception. it sums overlaps using customised pharmacophore features. however, this requires painstaking manual definition of the target features.

for grouping pharmacophores at a quantitative level, it is important to find an optimal partition method. cluster analysis or clustering aims to separate data into groups or clusters. clustering methods group data based on their pairwise distances. in other words, similar objects are grouped together more closely than dissimilar objects. there are some fundamental steps involved in a clustering activity including data extraction, similarity measurement, clustering and validation  <cit> . in cheminformatics applications, hierarchical clustering is one of the most popular approaches. these clustering methods group data based on their distances. the group average method  and ward's method  <cit>  are two examples of hierarchical methods. partition evaluation is a significant step to judge a clustering method. if the clustering method is applied to a benchmark dataset of known classification, then validation methods such as the rand index and the adjusted rand index  <cit>  for supervised learning can be applied for comparing the results of the clustering method with the benchmark classification. otherwise, unsupervised learning evaluation algorithms such as the davies-boulding index  <cit>  can be used.

we present here a pharmacophore-aided iterative closest point  clustering method for grouping pharmacophores using both their structural and chemical information. in this paper, discovery studio modelling environment http://accelrys.com, release  <dig>  or  <dig> , is used to generate the pharmacophores. there are six features defined in discovery studio from which to construct pharmacophore models. they are hydrogen bond acceptor, hydrogen bond donor, hydrophobic, positive ionisable   <cit>  , negative ionisable   <cit>  and ring aromatic ")  <cit> . a computer vision method, iterative closest point   <cit> , is employed to calculate pharmacophore structural distances and a greedy alignment method is applied to measure the chemical distance. these two distance measures are then combined prior to hierarchical clustering. the method is evaluated relative to existing methods using two sets of experimental data. the results demonstrate that the proposed method is not only of benefit for classification of pharmacophores, but also has the potential to facilitate research in the field of antibody-antigen interactions.

methods
data preparation and pharmacophore generation
two experimental data sets were used in testing. the first set of  <dig> globulin binding steroids  was introduced by carmer et al  <cit> . in recent years, this dataset has been studied using a range of clustering methods and descriptors  <cit> . we compare our proposed method to a previous study  <cit>  that used four-point pharmacophores as molecular descriptors.

antibody-antigen binding is known to be highly specific  <cit> . pharmacophores, by definition  <cit> , can describe features involved in the interaction between compounds and target. therefore, our second evaluation involves classifying pharmacophores generated from antibody-antigen complexes. the complexes were obtained from the protein data bank  <cit>  and information about the antibodies and antigens was gathered from an online self maintaining database sacs  <cit> . after applying the selection criteria ,  <dig> entries were selected and aligned by clustal omega  <cit> . to simplify the evaluation,  <dig> complexes were selected, corresponding to  <dig> differently named antibodies  and  <dig> types of antigens  . however, discovery studio does not accept compounds over  <dig> atoms or protein as ligands. therefore, for each of the large  protein antigens, the compound had to be cut into several parts and be saved in molecule format . the cutting was based on the potential contact surface on the antigens. the potential contact surfaces were determined by finding the neighbouring  amino acids of the antibody chains.

discovery studio modelling environment, release  <dig> , generates the pharmacophores as *.chm files. several protocols were employed for generating the pharmacophores. the autopharmacophore generation protocol selects pharmacophores using a genetic function approximation  model  <cit> . this protocol aims to generate pharmacophore models from a single input molecule. thirty one pharmacophores were generated using this protocol. the pharmacophore details for the globulin binding steroids have been recorded . for protein-ligand interactions, the gfa model as coded in the receptor-ligand pharmacophore generation protocol was used to produce structure-based pharmacophore models. antibody-small molecules and antibody-protein parts were processed using this protocol. the details of the  <dig> antibody-antigen complex pharmacophores are listed in the table in additional file  <dig>  in this table, partial pharmacophores for large protein antigens were combined. the combination details are explained in the next section.

parsing pharmacophore files
the pharmacophore files produced by discovery studio include information such as name, coordinates, vector and tolerance etc. of the pharmacophore features. based on our method, a set of perl scripts were written to perform a series of steps to phase the pharmacophore files. structural and chemical information was extracted from pharmacophore files. to simplify the calculation, some vector features, such as hydrogen bond donors and hydrogen bond acceptors were represented as one point. the coordinates of this point were provided by the centroid of the vector. some statistics for each pharmacophore model were calculated and recorded, including the name of the features for each model, feature counters for each feature and so on. in the final stage of the phasing, the centroids of all pharmacophore models were normalized to , and new coordinates were calculated.

icp based structural distance calculation
the clustering was implemented in matlab using the iterative closest point  algorithm. icp  <cit>  is a method for optimizing the sum of squared distances between two sets of points. it is widely used in the fields of computer vision and robot navigation. the following is a summary of the icp algorithm we implemented. it calculates the 3d structural information of two pharmacophores p and q to generate a rotation matrix r and a translation matrix t.

for k =  <dig> to kmax

 <dig>  do selection and matching build k-d tree <cit>  and find closest neighbor pairs with knn search

 <dig>  if matches to edge vertices or worst matches detected do rejection point pairs

 <dig>  weight matched points weighting with compatibility of normal:

  w=np*nq 

 <dig>  minimize the error metric calculate r with singular value decomposition  <cit> :

  r=v*ut 

calculate t:

  t=q¯ ¯-r*p¯ 

 <dig>  assign and apply transformation

end for

the structural distance of the two pharmacophores was calculated using the root-mean-square deviation . rmsd values were normalized by dividing by the maximum distance. in the end, a n*n structural distance matrix was produced based on the number of pharmacophore models .

greedy alignment-based chemical distance calculation
the second significant part of the method is to compute a chemical distance matrix. a greedy alignment method was introduced to compare the chemical differences between pharmacophore models. this alignment approach was coded in matlab like the icp algorithm. in this method, a pharmacophore scoring matrix, as used in the pharmacophore alignment search tool   <cit> , played an important role. the procedure of the greedy alignment is as follows. let us consider two pharmacophore lists {pi}  and {qj} . n is the number of features in {pi} and m is the number of features in {qj}.

 <dig>  find common features from both groups and remove them

 <dig>  find the "best-unmatched"  features

a. remove them

b. increase the penalty score

 <dig>  calculate gaps 

a. increase the penalty score

the chemical distance matrix was calculated for each possible pair of pharmacophores. the matrix was then normalized by the maximum value of the gap penalty ). a gap penalty score of  <dig> per position was used in the calculation, as in the phast method  <cit> .

combined distance matrix
in the final step of the method, the structural distance matrix and the chemical distance matrix were integrated to form a mixed distance matrix. the combined matrix includes a geometric term s and a chemical term c:

  d=λ*s+*c 

in equation , λ can be adjusted to change the weights of 3d and chemical data. the workflow for the complete procedure can be found in figure  <dig> 

RESULTS
globulin-binding steroids
after applying our clustering method, a 31* <dig> distance matrix was generated. the tree  was created using t-rex  <cit>  from the combined matrix and using the neighbour joining method. this tree was compared with trees produced from the same dataset by two other methods  <cit> . one of the trees  was generated with the group average method  <cit> , and the other one  was derived using ward's method  <cit> .

for further comparison, a table of binding affinity information for the  <dig> molecules from the literature  <cit>  is provided as a gold standard to evaluate all three methods . the  <dig> molecules were divided into two groups based on this binding affinity data: group  <dig>  and group  <dig> , to provide a reference clustering  . for the clusterings produced by rodriguez and that produced by our method, the  <dig> compounds were also labeled based on the clustering results . both clusterings were then compared to the reference cbg clustering using the rand index and adjusted rand index methods  <cit> . the evaluation results are shown in table  <dig>  all methods performed equally well in recreating the benchmark clustering.

the labels for the  <dig> globulin binding steroids are based on cbg , group average , ward   and the combined 3d distance and chemical distance method proposed in this study .

rand index and adjusted rand index are given for the comparison of each of the clustering methods with the reference cbg clustering for  <dig> globulin binding steroids.

antibody-antigen complex dataset
in this section, the icp-based pharmacophore-aided method was applied to classify  <dig> groups of pharmacophores. the clustering method generated a 41* <dig> distance matrix. t-rex translated the distance matrix into a dendrogram .

to evaluate the result, we categorised the  <dig> complexes into two groups based on their antigens, as a benchmark clustering. results from the new method were clustered into  <dig> groups . there were two large clusters g <dig> , g <dig> . complexes 3d0l and 3d0v were misclassified, so we labelled them as g <dig>  and g <dig> . these two classifications were compared using the rand index and adjusted rand index. the results  demonstrate an excellent agreement between the two classifications.

discussion
in the dataset of  <dig> steroid compounds, some pairs had been reported that should be grouped together closely . they were ,  and , that differ only by a methyl group. molecules  <dig> and  <dig> only differ by the stereochemistry of one centre on the a ring. comparison of figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> demonstrate that all three different methods have successfully grouped those reported pairs. the special structures of the two compounds  <dig> and  <dig> led to a misclassification  in all three methods. molecules  <dig> and  <dig> were incorrectly clustered as an exceptional cluster by our new method. with the exception of those molecules , the group average method, ward's method and our method all produced trees with the same two superclasses. rodriguez's methods and the new method have the same rand index value and a very close adjusted rand index. additionally, all rand index and adjusted rand index scores are above the threshold for a 'good' clustering .

considering the application of the proposed method to  <dig> antibody-antigen complexes, the pharmacophores were generally classified into two large super-clusters based on their antigens. one supercluster included all complexes with gp <dig> or a gp <dig> analog as antigen. the second supercluster had all the complexes with gp <dig> or one of its fragments as antigen. the classification did not only identify the antigens, within each supercluster, pharmacophores also formed clusters corresponding to their binding antibody . additionally, the rand index and adjusted rand index both were very high, which means the icp aided method performed well in clustering. in addition some interesting structural and chemical features highlighted by other researchers could be identified in the results. in complex 1u8h, the glu <dig> substitution has been reported to involve a water network rearrangement and thus this complex is structurally different from the other 1u8* complexes  <cit> . this can be seen by the unexpected position of 1u8h in a clustering based solely on 3d distance calculated using icp . in the same paper, 1u8l was reported to have chemical differences to the other 1u8* complexes. this can be seen on a dendrogram based solely on chemical distances . however, when 3d and chemical distances were combined, 1u8l and 1u8h were correctly clustered with other complexes with similar antigens .

CONCLUSIONS
a method combining a structural distance based on icp and a "chemical" distance has been developed and has been demonstrated to successfully partition pharmacophores based on the types of antigens in a set of antibody/antigen complexes or binding affinity in a set of steroids. in addition, the method is very fast. the  <dig> pharmacophore comparison only took around  <dig> seconds on a desktop computer . however, the method requires the number of pharmacophores being compared to be similar and was less accurate when the following ratio was larger than  <dig> : max/min
