BACKGROUND
the transcription factor yy <dig> is a gli-kruppel type zinc finger protein that is highly conserved from insects through vertebrates  <cit> . yy <dig> can function as an activator, repressor, or initiator depending upon the other regulatory elements in the region  <cit> . yy <dig> also interacts with a variety of proteins including components of rna polymerase ii complex, transcription factors, and histone-modifying complexes  <cit> . according to genome-wide surveys, about 10% of all human genes contain yy <dig> binding motifs in their promoter regions  <cit> . functionally, yy <dig> is involved in many biological processes, including embryonic development, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, b cell development, polycomb group gene -mediated repression, genomic imprinting, and x chromosomal inactivation  <cit> . yy <dig> was also initially identified as a factor controlling the transcriptional activity of the murine retrotransposon 'intracisternal a particle'  <cit> . since then, many retroposons, including sine, line, and endogenous retrovirus families, have been shown to contain yy <dig> binding sites in their promoter regions  <cit> . due to this ubiquitous presence of yy <dig> binding sites in genome-wide repeats, yy <dig> has also been regarded as a surveillance gene that is responsible for repressing transcriptional background noise from these repeats  <cit> .

the olfactory receptor  genes of mammals encode short, single coding exon, g protein-coupled receptors that are responsible for sensing a large number of air-borne scents  <cit> . this gene family is comprised of over  <dig> and  <dig>  gene members in human and mouse respectively, forming the largest gene family in mammalian genomes  <cit> . the aquatic vertebrates, the teleost fish lineage, also have a similar odorant receptor gene family  <cit> . however, the odorant receptor  family of the fish lineage consists of a much smaller number of genes than that of the mammals, and these or genes are also much more diverse in sequence identity than those of mammals. mammalian olfr genes are divided into class i and class ii groups based on sequence identity  <cit> . class ii genes make up ~90% of olfrs and are thought to have expanded during the transition to land-based living.

in mammals these olfactory receptors presumably expanded due to the selective advantage conferred by a well developed sense of smell  <cit> . while mice and other mammals retain function and expression of almost all olfrs, the majority of these are pseudogenized in humans  <cit> . the mammalian olfr genes are highly tissue-specific and are expressed primarily in the olfactory epithelium though a subset expresses in a chemosensory role in other tissues such as kidney and sperm  <cit> . furthermore, only one copy  out of all  <dig>  olfr genes is selected and expressed in each neuron cell of the olfactory tissue  <cit> . the unusual transcriptional control of the olfr gene family is likely mediated through unknown trans-acting factors  <cit> . the tissue-specific nature of their expression coupled with their widespread duplication requires a mitotically-stable global silencing mechanism in all cell types. according to recent studies, potential cis-regulatory elements recruiting these trans factors are hypothesized to be located within the protein-coding regions of the olfr genes rather than their surrounding genomic regions  <cit> .

while performing genome-wide searches of the dna-binding motifs of yy <dig>  we discovered that the mammalian olfr genes contain unusual clusters of yy <dig> binding sites within their protein-coding regions, whereas most yy <dig> binding sites are solitary and upstream of a regulated gene. in this study, we further analyzed the significance of this discovery with several bioinformatic and statistical measures, which will be described below. specifically we test whether the presence of the yy <dig> binding sites could be explained by dna sequence or amino acid motif conservation.

RESULTS
yy <dig> dna-binding motifs in the mammalian olfr genes
yy <dig> is predicted to be a global epigenetic regulator based on its ubiquitous expression and interaction with many histone-modifying enzymes  <cit> . as part of the efforts exploring this possibility, we have performed several series of yy <dig> binding motif searches using the genome sequences of mammals   <cit> . here we first scanned the genome sequences of human and mouse using a position weight matrix -based perl script. repetitive elements are known to contain yy <dig> binding sites so the repeatmasked genome was used  <cit> . later, the results of these searches were visualized using the repeat-masked custom track of the ucsc genome browser  <cit> . while inspecting global localization patterns of yy <dig> binding motifs in each genome, we noticed that clusters of yy <dig> binding motifs are co-localized with the genomic regions harboring olfactory receptor  genes. the mammalian olfr genes show a single coding exon structure, and they are also localized as gene clusters in specific regions of mammalian chromosomes. one such example is shown using the 100-kb genomic region from mmu  <dig> chromosome . this figure shows a representative sample of  <dig> olfr genes, and the locations of these genes coincide with those of yy <dig> binding motifs. each olfr gene appears to contain a range of  <dig> to  <dig> yy <dig> binding motifs within its 1-kb-long open reading frame . as expected, the coding regions correlate well to the placental mammal conservation plot, a default track available on the ucsc genome browser. also, the identified yy <dig> binding motifs appear to be random in location within the coding regions but do show a bias in orientation with respect to the direction of olfr gene transcription, which will be described later.

the unusual clustering of yy <dig> binding motifs within the protein-coding regions of the olfr genes was further analyzed to test if this pattern is unique to only the olfr genes or also found in the orfs of other genes. for this analysis, the entire set of the mouse mrna database was scanned with the pwm-based perl program to identify yy <dig> binding motifs. the number of the identified yy <dig> binding motifs within a given dna sequence corresponding to the transcript was further divided by the size of the mrna sequence, yielding a yy <dig> density score. the mouse mrna sequences  were subsequently binned based on their relative yy <dig> density scores . the y-axes of figure  <dig> represents the number of genes within a given range of the yy <dig> density score. this analysis indicated that the majority of the non-olfactory mouse mrna sequences  were distributed evenly and randomly throughout the varying ranges of the yy <dig> density score  . in contrast, our detailed inspection revealed that about half of the olfr gene set  show very high yy <dig> density scores. to better visualize this unusual pattern, we separated only the olfr gene set from the rest of the mrna set, and derived another histogram . as shown in figure 2b, about 45%  of the olfr genes have yy <dig> density scores ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , which are equivalent to  <dig> to  <dig>  yy <dig> binding sites per a 1-kb mrna sequence. in contrast, a scan of the  <dig> kb upstream regions of  <dig>  refseq genes revealed that only 10% of these putative promoter containing regions had a density greater than  <dig> yy <dig> binding sites.

we also repeated the above analyses using the mrna data sets derived from human, cow, and zebrafish transcriptomes to test the evolutionary conservation of this unusual clustering of yy <dig> binding motifs within olfr genes . the results from human and cow  mrna data sets also showed a pattern consistent with the mouse data set: an unusual clustering of yy <dig> binding motifs within many olfr genes. in humans we found 57%  of olfrs contain more than  <dig> yy <dig> binding sites while percentage in cow rose to 82% . it is important to note that the total number of the human olfr genes  in the figure is smaller than those of the other mammals since a large fraction of the human olfr genes are known to have become pseudogenes in recent evolutionary times and we removed all genes annotated as hypothetical. in contrast, the olfr genes of zebrafish do not show a similar pattern to mammals. the total  <dig> olfr genes of zebrafish show as wide a range of the yy <dig> density scores as seen in the other non-olfr genes . these results confirm that the unusual clustering of yy <dig> binding motifs within the olfr genes is a feature of the mammalian lineage.

statistical tests for the clustering of yy <dig> binding motifs within olfr genes
we performed two different series of analyses to test the functional significance of the observed clustering of yy <dig> binding motifs within the mammalian olfr genes. first, we tested whether some peptide motifs enriched within the protein sequences of the olfr genes are responsible for a spurious display of the yy <dig> binding motifs in the nucleotide sequences of the olfr genes. if some peptide motifs are enriched then we expect a significant difference in the number of those motifs found in olfr genes versus the rest of the proteome. for this test, we identified  <dig> individual dipeptides that can be encoded by the core motifs  of the yy <dig> binding consensus sequence, and determined if any of these dipeptides were over-represented in the protein sequences of the olfr genes . we first calculated the frequencies of all  <dig> possible combinations of dipeptides using all other protein sequences except olfr genes of the mouse to derive a reference set of the expected frequencies for the  <dig> dipeptides. in parallel, we also separately calculated the frequencies of the  <dig> dipeptides, including the  <dig> dipeptides that can encode the yy <dig> core motif, using only the protein sequences of the mouse olfr genes. the frequencies derived from the olfr genes  were compared with the reference set  via the z-score to identify any over-represented dipeptides within the olfr genes  . this global comparison did not immediately identify any dipeptides that are unusually enriched within the protein sequences of the olfr genes. however, according to the detailed analyses using the z-score values, two dipeptides  among the  <dig> dipeptides for the yy <dig> core motif showed significant enrichment . even so, this enrichment is limited to the  <dig> bp yy <dig> core binding site and not the complete  <dig> bp motif which we used to calculate yy <dig> density in olfr genes. furthermore, the reverse-translated sequences of these two peptides  have  <dig> and  <dig> fold degeneracy, respectively. this means that only one out of  <dig> pl or  <dig> ai dipeptides may contain the actual core motif of the yy <dig> binding consensus sequence. therefore, the detection of  <dig> to  <dig> yy <dig> binding motifs per one olfr gene cannot be simply accounted for by the serendipitous overlap between the yy <dig> core motif and a subset of codon combinations encoding frequent peptide motifs of the olfr genes.

*only the 21/ <dig> yy <dig> core forming dipeptides where observed count in olfactory receptor genes is greater than expected are shown.

as a second measure, we carefully analyzed the positions of the identified yy <dig> binding motifs within the orfs of the olfr genes . conservation in location of yy <dig> binding site would indicate conservation of the encoded dipeptide motif whereas a lack of conservation in motif location is consistent with selection for the presence of the motif at the dna level. the full length yy <dig> binding motifs within the olfr genes do not show any patterns in their relative positions to the protein sequences of the olfr genes as would be detected by conserved dipeptide motifs. however, there is a bias in the orientation yy <dig> binding sites in olfr genes. olfr genes contain an average of  <dig>  forward sites for every reverse site per  <dig> kilobase. non-olfr genes show only a slight bias of  <dig>  reverse sites for every forward site per  <dig> kilobase. in contrast, a similar analysis on the members of the histone  <dig> gene family  resulted in a different outcome. two potential yy <dig> binding motifs were found within the protein-coding regions of this gene family, but the relative positions and orientations of these two motifs are identical and fixed among all the members of this gene family in mouse. the two identified yy <dig> binding motifs also coincide with two conserved peptide motifs . given the high levels of sequence conservation detected within the members of the histone  <dig> family , it is uncertain whether the identified yy <dig> binding motifs are genuine cis-regulatory elements or simply reflecting the serendipitous sequence match between the yy <dig> core motifs and some combinations of codons encoding conserved peptides. this pattern is in stark contrast to the random patterns associated with the position of yy <dig> binding motifs in the olfr genes. this random pattern supports our initial idea that the clusters of the yy <dig> binding motifs within the olfr genes most likely have been formed and maintained as cis-regulatory elements by purifying selection at the dna sequence level. the bias favoring forward orientation may be an indication that forward sites enhance the efficiency of yy <dig> suppression of olfactory receptor genes. it is conceivable that multiple yy <dig> binding sites have been selected in olfr genes with a preference for directionality as well as number. alternatively, the non-random placement and orientation in histone  <dig> genes along with their extreme conservation prohibits a determination of whether selection is occurring at the dna level or the protein level.

discussion
in the current study, we have shown an unusual enrichment of yy <dig> dna-binding motifs in the olfr gene family of mammals. about half of the members of the olfr gene family have a range of 4- <dig> yy <dig> binding motifs within their protein-coding regions . statistical analyses further confirmed that this enrichment of yy <dig> binding motifs is consistent with functional relevance and has likely been driven by unknown selection pressure at the dna level. overall, the current study suggests a potential role of yy <dig> or yy1-related transcription factors in the regulation of the mammalian olfr genes. also, this study provides further evidence that the protein-coding regions of vertebrate genes can both encode codon information and contain cis-regulatory elements for transcription factor binding.

the mammalian olfr genes are expressed primarily in olfactory neurons, and only one single copy  out of the entire  <dig>  family members is expressed and functional in a given neuron cell  <cit> . this highly tissue-specific expression pattern of the olfr genes necessitates a global repression mechanism for the majority of the olfr genes in neural cells and in the other cell types. this mechanism acts prior to, and is separate from the negative feedback which prevents bi- and multi-allelic expression in olfactory neurons  <cit> . since unknown mechanisms are believed to repress a large number of the olfr genes all the time in most of the cell types, it is likely that these repression mechanisms are mediated through epigenetic modifications. since yy <dig> is a well-known epigenetic regulator in the animal genome, it is plausible to propose that the identified yy <dig> binding motifs may play some roles in the predicted repression mechanisms for the olfr genes  <cit> . in that regard, it is important to note that yy <dig> is one of the polycomb group gene  members found in both invertebrates and vertebrates  <cit> . furthermore, recent studies hinted at the possibility that pcg-mediated repression mechanisms might be involved in the regulation of the olfr genes  <cit> . in mutant mouse embryonic stem cells lacking the embryonic ectoderm development  protein, some olfr genes do not replicate asynchronously as they differentiate, suggesting a loss of the typical pattern of monoallelically expressed genes  <cit> . according to the results from another recent study, some cis-regulatory elements responsible for selecting one active olfr copy in a given neuron cell are predicted to be located within the protein-coding regions of the olfr genes  <cit> . this is intriguing and consistent with the observation of the current study in that some critical cis-elements are located within the protein-coding regions of the olfr genes. the genetic code is optimal for containing multiple layers of encoded information within protein-coding regions  <cit> . in sum, although further investigation is warranted, it is likely that the identified yy <dig> binding motifs are functionally important cis-regulatory elements for the regulation of the olfr genes.

the yy <dig> binding motifs identified within the olfr genes are unusual since they are localized within the protein-coding regions of these genes and are present at high density. this is quite different from the typical pattern in which transcription factor binding sites  are located in the genomic regions surrounding the protein-coding regions of genes. olfr genes give a fitness advantage by duplication and divergence while remaining active, yet must also retain regulatory information. according to our statistical analyses , the identified yy <dig> binding motifs within the olfr genes likely represent evolutionarily selected cis-regulatory elements. previous studies have shown high levels of yy <dig> binding affinity to the type of yy <dig> binding motifs found within olfrs  <cit> . though the functionality of the identified yy <dig> binding motifs remains to be demonstrated in vivo, it is plausible that some functional constraints serve to maintain the yy <dig> binding motifs within the protein-coding regions of the olfr genes. in one scenario these motifs might be linked to the sudden expansion of this gene family in mammalian genomes. the copy number of the olfr genes has increased dramatically in recent evolutionary times in mammalian genomes, providing a large number of receptor proteins for airborne scents  <cit> . the clustering of the olfr genes in chromosomal regions also suggests this gene family may have been duplicated through in situ tandem duplications  <cit> . tandem duplication is known to be the most frequent mechanism in increasing copy numbers for gene families  <cit> . however, it is not well understood how this mechanism carries over the proper information for the transcriptional regulation of duplicated gene copies. in the case of the mammalian olfr genes, their protein-coding regions may have both information for codon and cis-regulatory elements so that the duplication of these genes would most likely guarantee their coding potential as well as associated transcriptional control. this might have been one functional constraint for the co-evolution of the yy <dig> binding motifs within the protein-coding potential of the olfr genes.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study reports that an unusual enrichment of yy <dig> binding sites, 4- <dig> binding sites per gene, are located in the coding regions of olfactory receptor genes in mammals. according to statistical analyses, these yy <dig> binding sites most likely have been selected as cis-regulatory elements. also, similar patterns are found in other mammals, but not in fish, suggesting a mammalian-specific phenomenon. this study further suggests yy <dig> or yy1-related transcription factors as regulators of mammalian olfr genes.
