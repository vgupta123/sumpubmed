BACKGROUND
fatty acids  are a major energy source and important constituents of cell membranes, playing a relevant role as cellular signaling molecules in various metabolic pathways, including metabolic diseases  <cit> . environmental and genetic effects determining fa composition in pigs have been the subject of many studies. supporting a genetic influence on fa composition moderate to high heritability estimates have been reported  <cit> . however, the molecular process controlling fa composition and metabolism is far from being fully understood. technological, nutritional and organoleptic properties of pork meat quality are highly dependent on lipid content and fa composition  <cit> . thus, elucidating this molecular process could aid improve meat quality for healthy human consumption and increase knowledge of fa metabolism, underpinning metabolic diseases. pigs are important models for metabolic diseases such as obesity, type ii diabetes  and atherosclerosis  <cit> .

molecular pathways controlling lipid metabolism are highly interconnected. also, they interact with other related pathways, such as carbohydrate metabolism and energy homeostasis pathways. together, these pathways and its interactions constitute an essential metabolic network for homeostatic control and normal organism development  <cit> . in this context, a system biology approach focused on the connections and functional interactions between genes that underpin these metabolic pathways is an attractive alternative to the classical “single-gene-single-trait” approach found in most genome-wide association studies  using single nucleotide polymorphisms .

the main goal of this study was to employ a previously described system biology approach termed association weight matrix   <cit>  and, based on a snp-to-snp co-association evidence, infer a gene network for intramuscular  fa composition in pigs. this multi-trait approach was applied to data from  <dig> phenotypes related to fa composition and metabolism from an iberian x landrace intercross. iberian pigs are a local mediterranean breed extreme for obesity and appetite  <cit> , whereas landrace is a lean international breed. the analysis of the predicted gene network revealed key transcription factors that are network hubs and would be critical to determining meat quality, fa composition and controlling energy homeostasis. finally, we experimentally validated some of the awm network predictions using real-time pcr gene co-expression analyses in adipose and liver tissues.

RESULTS
genotyping data from  <dig>  snps in  <dig> backcross pigs  was employed for gwas of fatty acid related traits in the longissimus dorsi muscle. for all  <dig> phenotypes, estimated snp additive effects were standardized  by subtracting the mean and dividing by the phenotype-specific standard deviation. after applying a series of selection criteria , a total of  <dig>  snps were retained to build the awm matrix. correlations between phenotypes were calculated using awm columns  and were visualized as a hierarchical tree cluster, in which strong positive and negative correlations are displayed as proximity and distance, respectively . the observed cluster distribution is in concordance with the physiological similarities and relationships among fa. hence, palmitic acid with saturated fa , oleic with monounsaturated fa , and linoleic with polyunsaturated fa  cluster together . linoleic acid and pufa are clearly differentiated from other fas. this result can be explained by the inability of mammals to synthesize linoleic and α-linoleic fas, which must be provided by the diet. gene interactions were predicted using pair-wise correlation analysis of the snp effects across pair-wise rows of the awm. hence, the awm predicted gene interactions based on significant co-association between snps. in the network, every node represents a gene , whereas every edge connecting two nodes represents a significant interaction. in total,  <dig>  significant edges  between the  <dig>  nodes were identified as significant by the pcit algorithm  <cit>  . for every node we computed the total number of connections based on significant interactions. table  <dig> lists the ten most connected nodes and additional file 1: table s <dig> their positional concordance with fat-related qtl deposited in the pig qtl database.

gene ontology  and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to gain insight into the predicted gene network. overrepresented go terms in the network included: “cellular component organization” , “cellular component organization or biogenesis” , “cell projection morphogenesis” , “fatty acid metabolic process” , “glycerolipid metabolic process” , “sphingolipid metabolic process”  and “unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic process” . additional file 2: table s <dig> provides the full list of overrepresented go terms. pathway analyses revealed an enrichment for “regulation of actin cytoskeleton ”, “focal adhesion ”, “pathways in cancer ”, “chemokine signalling pathway ”, “phosphatidylinositol signalling system ” and “inositol phosphate metabolism ” .

to identify potential regulators of the above-mentioned pathways and go categories, we focused on tf found in the gene network. we applied an information lossless approach that explored the  <dig>  possible trios among the available  <dig> tf  and identified the tf trio that spanned most of the network topology with minimum redundancy. these three tf were: nuclear receptor coactivator  <dig> , e1a binding protein p <dig>  and four and a half lim domains  <dig> . interestingly, the promoter region of these tf contain binding sites for some well-known tf that are considered as important regulators of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism such as: srebp- <dig>  pparg, ppar-α, hnf1a, hnf4-α, er-α and gr-α. in the predicted network, a total of  <dig> genes show co-association with the three key tf . a detailed examination of the most representative pathways related to these  <dig> predicted target genes showed a significant overrepresentation for “hif- <dig> signaling pathway ”, “acute myeloid leukemia ”, “colorectal cancer ”, “renal cell carcinoma ” and “type ii diabetes mellitus ” . admittedly, some of the above-mentioned go terms and pathways could have been expected from a network predicted from gwas of fa-related phenotypes and this gives confidence in the reliability of the results. others, however, were unexpected and might lead to new insights on fa physiology.

experimental validation: from co-association to co-expression analysis in liver and adipose tissues
the expression of the three tf across longissimus dorsi muscle , adipose and liver tissues was explored. in concordance with previous results suggesting that highly connected tf are in general broadly expressed across tissues  <cit> , the three tf were expressed across all the studied tissues. further, a comparison between iberian and landrace pig breeds revealed significant increase fold changes  in the liver of iberian pigs for the expression of ncoa <dig>  and ep <dig>  .

the expression patterns of  <dig> genes in liver and  <dig> genes in adipose tissue were successfully measured across  <dig> backcross animals. in liver, the expression data of twelve additional genes were also included in the co-expression analysis . co-expression analysis revealed highly connected networks in both liver and adipose tissue, suggesting strong functional interconnections among the studied genes. topology of liver co-expression network showed  <dig> nodes connected by  <dig> edges  and in adipose tissue  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges were observed . network parameters such as average degree  and average distance  were slightly higher in liver co-expression network compared to adipose tissue network . based on network centrality, the relevance of individual genes differs within each network. for example, topological properties of the liver co-expression network suggest an important role for arnt in the regulation of hepatic lipogenic and glucoconeogenesis activity, and these findings agree with published results  <cit> . it should be noted that bcl <dig> showed the highest centrality value in the liver co-expression network . in addition, degree analysis showed that bcl <dig>  ep <dig>  pbx <dig>  sirt <dig>  pip5k1a and arnt were the most central genes in the liver co-expression network. however, in the adipose co-expression network, degree analysis suggested that ank <dig>  ncoa <dig>  sirt <dig>  eif4e, hmbox <dig> are the most central genes . when analysing a sub-network of the liver co-expression network, formed only by the same  <dig> genes included in the adipose co-expression network, five genes  were still the most central genes and this finding underscores their relevant role in the function and structure of the liver co-expression network.

beyond the study of the topological properties of the liver and adipose tissue co-expression networks, we were concerned with those, if any gene interactions predicted via snp co-association were corroborated through co-expression analyses. in line with recent results in yeast  <cit> , we observed that interacting loci could jointly regulate the co-expression patterns of pairs of genes. for the first time in a not model species, co-expression analyses confirmed gene-gene interactions predicted based on snp co-association. however, the magnitude of this validation varied in a tissue-specific manner. for instance, with respect to the liver module formed by  <dig> awm nodes and  <dig> edges  we observed that  <dig> %  of the predicted gene-gene interactions were validated by the co-expression results. whereas in the adipose tissue, the observed percentage of the awm validated interactions was slightly higher representing  <dig> % of the possible combinations . when we limited this comparison to the intersecting  <dig> genes included in both co-expression networks, the proportion of the awm gene-gene interactions validated in liver  was still lower than in adipose tissue . comparing both networks, we observed that approximately  <dig> %  of the interactions validated in the adipose tissue were also validated in the liver co-expression analysis . interestingly, these always co-associated and co-expressed genes belong to biological processes related to lipid metabolism including: negative regulation of fat cell differentiation , androgen receptor signalling pathway , response to hormone stimulus  and lipid metabolic process .

when we focused on the best tf trio, we observed that  <dig> %  of the interactions of ncoa <dig> predicted by the awm co-association network were corroborated in the co-expression network of the adipose tissue. this percentage dropped to  <dig> %  in the co-expression network of the liver tissue. for ep <dig>   <dig> %  of the awm predicted interactions were observed in the adipose co-expression network and  <dig> %  in the liver co-expression network. finally, for fhl <dig> we observed the lowest percentage of validated interactions:  <dig> %  in adipose tissue and  <dig> %  in liver .

discussion
molecular processes controlling fa metabolism are highly interconnected and linked with related pathways, such as lipid, carbohydrate and energy metabolism. in fact, fa are a major energy source and together with several factors, such as total energy intake, dietary fat/carbohydrate ratio, or glucose and/or insulin concentration, regulate de novo lipogenesis  <cit> . as a consequence, it is expected that at the selected threshold  our best trio of tf  show co-association with a large number of genes and other tf relevant for lipid, carbohydrate and energy metabolism. for instance,  <dig> of the predicted target genes via snp co-association  have been recently reported in two large-scale meta-analysis studies for plasma lipids in humans  <cit> . interestingly, many of these genes, including our tf trio and other fa relevant genes, would have been missed by traditional single-trait gwas due to the lack of an acceptably significant association level . as noted before  <cit>  and confirmed by this study, awm points to new candidate genes, tf and gene interactions via exploring snp co-associations across multiple traits beyond the one-dimensional approach for identifying genes affecting single traits. however, results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited sample size used in our study , which reduces the power to identify small effects and may introduce spurious results. therefore, these tf might regulate other important genes for imf fa composition not represented in this network and false positive results may be included in the network. however, only the snps associated with a large number of phenotypes were included in the awm analysis and, due the multi-trait nature of the awm methodology, the probability that the same snp was associated with several phenotypes by chance is much lower than the probability of being associated with a single phenotype.

in the predicted network, ncoa <dig>  a key tf regulating energy homeostasis  <cit>  and adipogenesis  <cit> , showed co-association with a total of  <dig> genes, including relevant tf and genes associated with lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms, such as prox <dig>  pbx <dig>  arnt, myb, mtf <dig>  tcf7l <dig>  scd <dig>  abcc <dig>  insig <dig>  acacb, fabp <dig>  fabp <dig>  me <dig>  aasdh, abcc <dig> and sort <dig>  a role for prox <dig> in the control of energy homeostasis has been proposed  <cit> . moreover, association of snps mapped to prox <dig> and slc30a <dig> with fasting glucose levels and increased risk for t2d has been reported in humans  <cit> . both prox <dig> and slc30a <dig>  together with other t2d risk loci  and  <dig> genes reported as associated with plasma lipids in humans  <cit>  were predicted as target genes of ncoa <dig> in our study. co-expression analysis in adipose tissue validated  <dig> % of the ncoa <dig> co-association target genes, including insig <dig> , fdft <dig> , setd <dig>  and abcc <dig> . in liver,  <dig> % of the predicted targets of ncoa <dig> were validated, including the above-mentioned prox <dig> , hnf1a  and tcf7l <dig> . it should be noted that previous studies in pigs show a correlation between ncoa <dig> expression  and imf content of ld muscle  <cit> . also, ncoa <dig> was reported as modulating an awm-network predicted for puberty in cattle  <cit> , which included fat deposition measurements as traits related to puberty. furthermore, knockout ncoa2-/- mice are protected against obesity, showing lean phenotype and decreased expression of genes involved in the uptake and storage of fa  <cit> . a decreased expression of genes required for fa synthesis in liver tissue of ncoa2-/- mice was observed  <cit> . in agreement with these previous results and the phenotypic difference in fat deposition between iberian and landrace breeds, a significant higher activity of ncoa <dig> in the liver of iberian pigs was detected  relative to landrace pigs .

another tf predicted as critical for fa regulation was ep <dig>  which encodes the adenovirus e1a-associated cellular p <dig> transcriptional co-activator protein. it functions as histone acetyltransferase that regulates transcription by chromatin remodelling. via histone acetyltransferase activity, ep <dig> regulates the transcription of liver x receptor   <cit> . ep <dig> is also required for adipocyte differentiation through the regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma   <cit> . remarkably, ep <dig> has been reported as transcriptional co-activator of estrogen receptor , hepatocyte nuclear factor  <dig> α , aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator  and hepatocyte nuclear factor- <dig> α   <cit> . all these above-mentioned tf co-regulated by ep <dig>  influence lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms and have been extensively studied in this context  <cit> . among the  <dig> awm-predicted target genes for ep <dig>  there are  <dig> genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism including arnt a member of the hif- <dig> pathway. arnt is a relevant tf regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipogenic gene expression  <cit> . interestingly, we observed a significant co-expression between arnt and ep <dig>  in the liver network. additionally, other genes related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were predicted as ep <dig> awm-target genes. these included: adcy <dig>  mmp <dig>  echs <dig>  arrb <dig>  eif4e, ank <dig>  nr2e <dig>  slc2a <dig>  slc5a <dig>  lep, elovl <dig>  mttp, acsm <dig>  ucp <dig> and cyp2e <dig> . similarly to ncoa <dig>  a significant higher expression of ep <dig> in the liver of iberian pigs was detected  in comparison with landrace pigs . our results, predicting targets for ep <dig> and studying their co-expression contributes to the knowledge on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. it is well known that tf require co-regulators to modify and epigenetically remodel chromatin structure to facilitate the basal transcriptional machinery. ep <dig> is a chromatin remodeling gene opening new possibilities to study the roll of epigenetic modifications in the regulation of pork meat quality and the molecular control of energy homeostasis.

the third key tf was fhl <dig>  an evolutionarily conserved gene that can interact with an important range of proteins from different functional classes, including receptors, signal transducers, tf and cofactors  <cit> . fhl <dig> plays an important role as molecular transmitter linking various signalling pathways to transcriptional regulation. for instance, fhl <dig> is involved in the co-activation of human androgen receptor , er and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha   <cit> . in addition, fhl <dig> mediates interaction with β-catenin and promotes myoblast c2c <dig> differentiation in mice  <cit> . the gene b-cell cll/lymphoma  <dig> , an activator of the wnt/β-catenin  <cit>  and wingless-type mmtv integration site family, member  <dig>  was among the  <dig> targets predicted for fhl <dig> in our network. the growth factor wnt <dig> is a member of the wnt signaling pathway involved in developmental processes and relevant for gonad development and sex-determination  <cit> . liver expression analyses provided supporting evidence for the predicted interaction between fhl <dig> and wnt <dig>  as a significant co-expression  was observed. other genes and tf associated with development process, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, such as fhl <dig>  myo1e, myb, rorc, jarid <dig>  zfhx <dig>  wnk <dig>  lipc, creb <dig>  cdc <dig>  acsl <dig>  fabp <dig>  abcb <dig>  flt <dig> and htr2a were also predicted as targets of fhl <dig> according to the co-association network. fhl <dig> was not differentially expressed in the comparison between iberian and landrace pigs. also, fhl <dig> showed a proportion of validated interactions in the co-expression analysis  lower than for the other two tf, ncoa <dig> and ep <dig>  these somewhat less promising results could be a consequence of the tissue-specific activity of fhl <dig>  as it has been reported for the co-activation of ar <cit> .

although, some gene to gene interactions predicted by the awm approach were not corroborated by the co-expression analysis, the possibility of these interactions occurring in other spatial temporal and/or tissues cannot be ruled out, or indeed manifesting their joint effect through other means than co-expression. tf and their target genes interact in a temporal and tissue dependent manner, so the examination of networks spanning multiple tissues is critical to highlight interactions that could otherwise be unknown from individual tissue analysis  <cit> . in spite of this tissue/time limitation, two of the three tf from the best trio  showed higher than average centrality values in both liver and adipose tissue co-expression networks. moreover, we observed a significant co-expression between ncoa <dig> and ep <dig> in the liver network with some other tf considered master regulators of the lipid metabolism. for instance, ncoa <dig> was significantly co-expressed with pparα , hnf1a  and hnf4α , and ep <dig> was co-expressed with ppard  and hnf1a  . the liver plays a central role in maintaining overall energy balance by controlling lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. in pigs, the liver is the primary site of de novo cholesterol synthesis and fatty acid oxidation and, together with adipose tissue, has a crucial role in regulating lipid metabolism  <cit> . all these observations, together with the higher expression of ncoa <dig> and ep <dig> observed in the liver of the iberian pigs compared with landrace pigs, suggest a relevant role of these genes in the hepatic transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism in pigs.

overall, our gwas and network predictions, supported by literature and co-expression analysis in liver and adipose tissue, suggest a co-operative role for the three tf  in the transcriptional regulation of imf, fa composition and the control of energy homeostasis in pigs. we hypothesize that these tf mediate a highly inter-connected regulatory cascade including pathways such as hif- <dig>  ar, er and wnt/β-catenin that seem pivotal for lipid metabolism. the role of these pathways in the transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism is a subject of intense studies  <cit> . a functional cooperation between the three tf in the modulation of these pathways is evident from our results and supported by literature evidence. for example, according to string database  <cit>  , experimental data confirmed that protein-protein interaction exists among, ep <dig>  ncoa <dig>  fhl <dig>  ar and esr <dig> . in addition, ep <dig> and ncoa <dig> take part on the ar and er pathways and both, ncoa <dig> and fhl <dig> are ar co-regulators  <cit> . studying the combined effect of ncoa <dig>  ep <dig>  and fhl <dig> in the regulation of specific genes will lead to new knowledge related to fa pathways.

the most overrepresented pathway corresponding to the  <dig> awm-predicted target genes of the three tf was hif- <dig> . the hif- <dig> pathway is central to adaptive regulation of cellular energy metabolism; by regulating the expression of glycolytic enzymes and hepatic lipid metabolism  <cit> . our liver co-expression analysis supports previously reported evidence  <cit>  for the relevance of arnt gene  in the hepatic lipogenic gene expression. additionally, hif-1α, which is another member of hif pathway and β-catenin co-ordinately enhance ar transactivation. the interaction between β-catenin and both hif- <dig> and ar pathways has been documented  <cit> . moreover, β-catenin is a ligand-dependent co-activator of ar and a functional cooperation in the synergistic activation of ar-mediated transcription among ep <dig>  fhl <dig> and β-catenin have been reported  <cit> . ours results showing the interactions between the three key tf, recapitulate these pathways interactions that are known mammalian biology, extending its significance to pigs.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results suggest that common genetic variants mapped to  ep <dig>  fhl <dig> and ncoa <dig> together with other candidate genes including arnt, bcl <dig>  sirt <dig>  pbx <dig>  prox <dig>  hnf1a, slc30a <dig>  tcf7l <dig> and ank <dig> modulate lipid metabolism and control energy homeostasis in pigs. furthermore, epistatic predicted interactions between tf and their target genes are likely to contribute to the complex inheritance of fa composition and related polygenic traits . it is generally accepted that metabolic diseases such as obesity and t2d are linked to disturbance of energy homeostasis or homeostatic imbalance. it should be noted that among the  <dig> predicted target genes, an overrepresentation of genes from the t2d pathway was observed . also,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes are known to control plasma lipid content in humans  <cit> .

further studies will be required to elucidate the specific cellular and molecular processes of interaction among the three tf and its target genes that determine fa composition and control energy homeostasis in pigs. the implications of research in this area are broad, ranging from applications from pork meat quality to modeling mammal biology.
