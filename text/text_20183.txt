BACKGROUND
until very recently, the database of genomic sequences for insect species has been restricted to model species. now, with the recent advances in dna sequencing technology, the generation of sequence data has increased at an unprecedented rate. as new sequencing technologies became less expensive, it is possible to generate genomic information from non-model species. this holds a great promise for several species with medical, veterinary or economic importance.

new world screw-worm , cochliomyia hominivorax, is one of the most important insect pests in south and central america  <cit> . nws myiasis is caused by the larval stage of the fly infesting tissues of warm-blooded vertebrates. such infestations cause significant losses in the livestock industry through morbidity, mortality and the cost of treating infested animals. this insect pest also represents a serious public health problem in the caribbean region, where screw-worm infestations in humans are frequently reported  <cit> . historically, nws was widely distributed from the southern u.s. to central argentina. however, this species has been successfully eradicated from north and most of central america by the sterile insect technique  <cit> . in south america and in the caribbean region, however, this pest continues to affect the development of the livestock sector and wider economic development.

in its current geographical distribution, nws has been controlled exclusively by chemical insecticides, in particular organophosphate  and pyrethroid-based compounds  <cit> . nevertheless, the intensive use of these chemicals has led to the selection of resistant strains, which, in turn, compromises the effective control of nws. in this context, the elucidation of the molecular basis of insecticide resistance in nws is of great value to minimize its effect by adopting resistance management strategies. the major mechanisms of insecticide resistance already described in several insects involve the alteration of target sites inducing insensitivity to the insecticide  and/or an increase in the rate of insecticide metabolism   <cit> . the metabolic resistance may result from coding sequence alteration of metabolic genes and/or over-expression of enzymes capable of metabolizing the insecticide  <cit> .

despite its medical and veterinary importance and its negative economic impact on the livestock sector, only limited genetic information is available for the nws. molecular studies in this species focused on the characterization of molecular markers in the mitochondrial  <cit>  and nuclear genomes  <cit> , their utilization in population genetic studies  <cit>  and the characterization of genes and substitutions involved in insecticide resistance  <cit> . in a recent study, one substitution was found in the acetylcholinesterase gene , whose product is the target of op, but with a very low frequency in several nws populations  <cit> . no substitutions were found in the sodium channel gene, target of pyrethroids  <cit> . in contrast, substitutions in the carboxylesterase e <dig> gene with very high frequencies were found in several nws populations surveyed  <cit> . this gene has been previously associated with op resistance in the sheep blowfly lucilia cuprina and in the housefly musca domestica  <cit> . in this enzyme, a g137d substitution in the oxyanion hole within the active site results in diethyl op resistance and a second substitution, w251l, in the acyl pocket of the active site also confers resistance to ops, mainly dimethyl op compounds, and pyrethroids  <cit> . however, there is no information currently available on metabolic resistance in nws based on up-regulation of detoxification enzymes such as cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases, glutathione s-transferases and carboxyl/cholinesterases.

now, the combined availability of a rapidly growing database of insect genomic sequences and the recent developments in sequencing technology provides an opportunity for genome-wide gene discovery in c. hominivorax, including genes that might be involved in insecticide resistance. parallel sequencing of short cdna fragments has been demonstrated as an excellent tool to generate genome-wide sequence information  <cit>  as well as levels of gene expression  <cit> .

here, as a part of an effort to characterize the c. hominivorax genome and identify putative genes involved in insecticide resistance, we sampled its transcriptome by deep sequencing of polyadenylated transcripts using the  <dig> sequencing technology. in this study, we report the analysis of ~ <dig>  expressed sequence tags  generated from three libraries , providing, to our knowledge, the largest est database for a calliphoridae species. we anticipate that the availability of these sequences will be of significant value to functional studies in c. hominivorax and closely related species in the calliphoridae family.

furthermore, we performed larval bioassays to select individuals resistant to an op insecticide. the presence of acetylcholinesterase  and carboxylesterase e <dig> mutations was investigated and quantitative polymerase chain reaction following reverse transcription  was used to identify differentially expressed genes putatively involved in metabolic resistance. our results add to the basic knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in op resistance and are of potential applied interest to assist the design of new and more effective strategies for controlling nws.

RESULTS
assembly
deep sequencing on the  <dig> platform of the three normalized libraries generated a total of  <dig>  reads of raw nucleotide sequence data with an average read length of  <dig> bp after the removal of low score ends . an overview of the pipeline for the analysis of c. hominivorax ests is presented in figure  <dig> 

reads from male, female and larval libraries were sorted by their unique multiplex identifiers sequences 

after quality evaluation,  <dig>  of the obtained reads were assembled using mira  <cit> . a subset of these reads.  <dig>  , was considered in the assembly, which resulted in  <dig>  unigenes . the mean unigene size was  <dig> bp, with an average coverage of  <dig>  sequences per nucleotide position. the average contig size obtained is consistent with previous reports describing est sequencing using the  <dig> technology for different insect species, melitaea cinxia  <cit> , sarcophaga crassipalpis  <cit>  and chrysomela tremulae  <cit> .

the average length of unigenes is affected by the high number of singletons and contigs formed by the assembly of very few short reads. this drawback resulting from the use of ngs is ameliorated by the depth of coverage. increased sequence depth results in increase length coverage of cdna sequence. taking a subset of contigs formed by the assembly of at least  <dig> reads , the average contig size increased to  <dig> bp . sampling the 10% longest contigs , the average contig size increased to  <dig> bp with an average coverage of  <dig>  sequences per nucleotide position. this sub-sampling showed that we have more than  <dig>  contigs with very good coverage, quality and length for downstream analysis.

functional annotation of c. hominivorax unigenes
to infer the functional identity of the nws unigenes, we mapped each unigene sequence to annotated transcripts from anopheles gambiae, aedes aegypti, culex pipiens, ixodes scapularis, pediculus humanus and the  <dig> sequenced drosophila species  using tblastx  <cit>  with relaxed criteria . about 44%  of the nws unigenes could be mapped to this database of protein-coding transcripts from the  <dig> insect species . each nws unigene was automatically assigned a gene annotation corresponding to the hit in the insect database with the highest e-value and that hit was considered as a putative homolog of the nws gene. the number of nws unigenes mapped to each insect library reflects the size of the library as well as the divergence of nws to each insect species.

the remaining unigenes  were remotely blasted against ncbi's non-redundant database and  <dig> had an acceptable hit against this library under our criteria . blasting c. hominivorax unigenes against the ncbi's 'nr' database, we obtained  <dig> hits to bacterial sequences that are either in association with c. hominivorax or formerly present in the blood and/or meat used in the rearing media 

gene ontology  classifications  <cit>  of the corresponding d. melanogaster orthologs were obtained from flybase  <cit> . nws unigenes were classified into the three go categories: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component, according to the standard go terms  <cit> . the top  <dig> most represented go categories in the pooled dataset are illustrated in figure  <dig>  under the category of biological process, proteolysis, protein amino acid phosphorylation, transport, mesoderm development and regulation of transcription were among the most highly represented categories, reflecting the most important metabolic activities in c. hominivorax. the representation of the go categories were very similar between male and female libraries. in larval libraries, some categories were over-represented, reflecting fundamental processes enriched in larvae, such as proteolysis, transport and the accumulation of lipids.

some genes belonging to go classes putatively involved in organophosphate resistance were selected for gene expression evaluation: cholinesterase, carboxylesterase, juvenile-hormone esterase, serine-type carboxypeptidase, glutathione transferase and monooxygenase activities .

the number of unigenes represents the number of assembled contigs that were mapped to the corresponding gene in d. melanogaster and the number of reads represents the the sum of the number of reads that were used for the assembly of each contig.

analysis of sex-specific and stage-specific transcripts
reads from male, female and larval libraries were sorted by their unique multiplex identifiers sequences  and the number of 454-ests derived from each library is presented in table  <dig>  to identify sex-and stage-specific transcripts, we mapped the sorted reads against nws unigenes . the largest library, adult female, showed the highest number of exclusive  unigenes , due to a higher chance of sampling rare transcripts. to reduce this artefact, we normalized the read counts by the total number of reads in each library and chose a threshold of a minimum representation  for any given unigene. the threshold was set to reduce the number of shared unigenes sampled by chance in only one library. we chose an arbitrary threshold of  <dig> reads in the smallest library , which corresponded to  <dig> reads in the larval library and  <dig> reads in the female library. in fact, the female library had the smallest number of exclusive unigenes with a sufficient representation . the larval library had the highest number of exclusive unigenes , closely followed by the male library . approximately 40% of the female-and male-specific unigenes were mapped to the database of d. melanogaster transcripts as described above . almost 55% of the larval-specific transcripts were mapped to the same database . for each library-specific unigene we recorded the gene-level high-throughput expression data of the putative ortholog in d. melanogaster obtained from flybase  <cit> . we used the expression data from l <dig> larva , 1-day-old adult males and 1-day-old adult females . by using this approach we could assess if the library-specific genes indeed have a stage-or sex-biased expression. we could only find a consistent pattern in the larval-specific genes; the unigenes that were found exclusively in our larval library also showed a higher expression level of the putative ortholog in d. melanogaster. among the putative orthologs with a clear larval-biased expression in d. melanogaster were four larval cuticle proteins, two larval serum proteins and three cuticular proteins, known for their higher expression in larvae. as expected, for most male- and female-exclusive unigenes we could not recover a sex-biased expression in d. melanogaster orthologs. sex-biased genes often evolve more rapidly, both in coding and regulatory sequence . hence, one would not expect the conservation of expression levels between these two highly divergent species.

in non-normalized cdna samples, the number of reads mapping to a specific unigene should be proportional to its level of expression. however, differences in transcript abundance in our normalized libraries may reflect different normalization efficiency rather than genuine differences in gene expression. nevertheless, highly abundant library-specific transcripts are potential candidates for differentially expressed genes among the different libraries. hence, we performed an analysis to identify such genes by aligning the sorted reads against all unigenes. the number of reads from each library normalized by the library size was used as a measure of the transcript abundance. comparing the larval library and the combined adult libraries, we found  <dig> unigenes with at least a 10-fold difference in the representation of reads . in our comparison between sexes , the number of transcripts with different representation was  <dig> . the top  <dig> unigenes with a different representation had an average fold change of  <dig> in the comparison between larval and adult samples and of  <dig> in the comparison between male and female library. most likely, the fold changes reported here are underestimations of the different representation of the transcripts in the three libraries, due to the small dynamic range of this analysis, but our purpose was to indicate some candidate genes for further studies, rather than a genome-wide gene expression profiling.

comparison to publicly-available c. hominivorax sequences
we compared our ests to nws sequences available in public databases. most of these sequences were non-annotated ests sequenced using the sanger technology from a single study  <cit> . we assembled the  <dig>  publicly-available ests  into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singlets and mapped our unigenes against this database using blast  <cit> . the comparison between our library and the sanger sequences showed that only  <dig>  of our unigenes have a hit in the sanger library. the high number of non-mapped hits in our library against the former one reflects the recovery of low expressed transcripts due to the higher throughput of our analysis.

to determine the source of the non-mapped transcripts, we aligned all 454-reads sorted to each library  against the assembled sanger sequences using pangea  <cit> . of the total good quality reads in each library, we could map  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   to the larval, adult female and adult male libraries, respectively. as expected, the largest number of mapped reads originates from the larval library, given that the sanger libraries were derived from c. hominivorax larvae and eggs.

analysis of genes related to secondary metabolism
genes coding for three enzyme families, cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases , glutathione s-transferases  and carboxyl/cholinesterases , putatively involved in metabolic detoxification of insecticides were selected after the functional annotation against d. melanogaster database  <cit> . nws unigenes mapped to  <dig> d. melanogaster genes of the cyp family. of these,  <dig> corresponded to cyp subfamilies found to be involved in insecticide resistance in previous studies  and among them,  <dig> belonged to the cyp <dig>  eight to the cyp <dig> and five to the cyp <dig> subfamilies. seven cce and six gst genes were also found among nws unigenes. all nws unigenes that mapped to these d. melanogaster genes were remotely searched in ncbi  to confirm the identity of the nws sequences. candidate genes  for the gene expression analysis using quantitative real time pcr  were selected based on unambiguous alignments between nws unigenes and d. melanogaster annotated genes.

carboxylesterase and acetylcholinesterase genotyping
bioassays with the dimethyl organophosphate dichlorvos  performed in duplicate with  <dig> nws larvae selected  <dig> and  <dig> resistant individuals in each replicate . a non-treated group was used as a control for further analyses. to identify allelic variants possibly involved in op resistance, we genotyped three substitutions  in the ache gene previously associated with op resistance in d. melanogaster and l. cuprina  <cit> . these three substitutions occur at key sites located within the active site gorge of this enzyme. the alteration of these amino acids results in a reduced sensitivity to op and carbamate insecticides  <cit> .

two regions containing these three substitutions  were amplified from the cdna synthesized using the rna pools from each group, control  and resistant group  <dig> . the pcr products were directly sequenced and only the wildtype allele was observed.

polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism  was used to identify two substitutions, g137d and w251s, previously characterized in nws carboxylesterase gene, e <dig>  <cit>  and associated with insecticide resistance . the g137d substitution in the oxyanion hole within the active site of the enzyme causes a shift in the enzyme function, from a carboxylesterase to an op hydrolase activity. this shift confers resistance to op insecticides with a preference for diethyl ops. the second substitution, w251s, in the acyl pocket of the active site also confers resistance to op insecticides, but with this substitution, the enzyme acquires a higher affinity for dimethyl op compounds  <cit> . of  <dig> individuals analyzed from the control group,  <dig> showed a substitution only on the first site ,  <dig> only on the second site  and  <dig> on both sites. individuals with both mutations had been cloned and sequenced previously  <cit>  showing only one mutation in each allele, according to studies in l. cuprina  <cit> . however, all  <dig> resistant individuals  were homozygous for the mutated allele, with the w251s substitution, indicating a strong association between this mutation and dichlorvos  resistance.

quantitative measure of gene expression in op resistant larvae
gene expression levels were measured for  <dig> candidate genes by qrt-pcr . of these, only one showed significant differences between control and resistant groups  <dig>  and  <dig> . in both resistant groups, r <dig> and r <dig>  a putative ortholog to the cyp6g <dig> gene was down-regulated when compared to the control group. a one-way anova between control and resistant groups was conducted to compare the levels of gene expression of cyp6g <dig>  there was a significant difference on gene expression levels . post hoc comparisons using the tukey hsd test indicated that the expression levels of cyp6g <dig> were significantly reduced in both resistant samples, r <dig>  and r <dig> . this gene was approximately 45-fold and 10-fold down-regulated in r <dig> in r <dig>  respectively .

discussion
given the economic importance of c. hominivorax it is surprising that only now there is an interest in functional studies involving this livestock pest. here, we took advantage of ngs to sequence and characterize c. hominivorax expressed sequence tags from three normalized libraries prepared with larval, adult female and adult male samples. we used the different normalized libraries to sample stage- and sex-specific transcripts involved in nws metabolism, and therefore, candidates for an involvement in metabolic insecticide resistance. furthermore, we wanted to generate a database of stage-specific transcripts that can be useful for future investigations of genes and gene networks involved in screw-worm infestations.

a large proportion of c. hominivorax cdnas contain novel sequences that apparently have no significant match in any of the existing databases. this is expected, as there is very little sequence information from closely related species. most of the non-mapped sequences are probably too divergent from sequences deposited in the available databases. a small proportion of these ests, however, probably derive from unique genes in c. hominivorax, and may include olfactory and gustatory receptors that are of interest for investigations into the feeding behavior of this parasitic species.

we used this data to investigate molecular mechanisms involved in organophosphate resistance in nws fly. a bioassay with the dimethyl op dichlorvos was conducted in order to select resistant individuals. acetylcholinesterase , target of op insecticides, is a key enzyme in the nervous system hydrolyzing excess amounts of acetylcholine into acetic acid and choline in the synapses and neuromuscular junctions  <cit> . none of the previously identified variants was found in the ache sequence in any of tested groups, suggesting that op resistance in nws is rather due to detoxification enzymes, unless other mutations not evaluated occurred in the ache gene. most variants on the ache active site might be deleterious and result in a high fitness cost. hence, such variants are not likely to be maintained as segregating polymorphisms in the population in the absence of a strong selection pressure. as the mutated nws carboxylesterase e <dig> degrades the insecticide before it can act on the ache target site, there is no pressure to maintain the deleterious ache variants, as verified in l. cuprina  <cit> .

elevated carboxylesterases levels associated with resistance to op and carbamate insecticides have been well documented in numerous arthropod species  <cit> . however, altered carboxylesterase resulting in op hydrolase activity has been described only for some dipteran species. substitutions in nws e <dig> gene were found in all individuals from the resistant and control groups. however, three different genotypes were found in control group, while all individuals resistant to dichlorvos showed a single genotype; they were all homozygous for the w251s allele. this evidence is strongly supported by biochemical studies in l. cuprina in which alteration in the acyl pocket of the active site also confers resistance to dimethyl ops  <cit> . although in vitro expression for e <dig> gene has not been performed in nws, our data indicate that a similar resistance based on altered e <dig> has evolved in nws fly.

besides carboxylesterases, up-regulation of genes encoding p <dig> s and gsts has been frequently associated with metabolic-based insecticide resistance mechanisms in insects  <cit> . in this context, this study is the first evaluation of the expression levels of genes putatively involved in insecticide metabolism in nws. of the  <dig> evaluated genes, only one showed differential gene expression among resistant and control groups, the putative ortholog to cyp6g <dig> 

since p <dig> s play a key role in detoxifying numerous xenobiotic compounds, we expected their involvement in dichlorvos metabolism. however, we did not observe an up-regulation in any of the cyp genes analyzed in the resistant groups . the association of the high expression of the cyp6g <dig> gene with insecticide resistance is still in debate. over-expression of the cyp6g <dig> gene was reported in d. melanogaster strains resistant to imidacloprid and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane   <cit> . the over-expression in resistant individuals of d. melanogaster from several populations was associated with the insertion of an accord element in the upstream regulatory region of the cyp6g <dig> gene  <cit> . the resistant individuals of d. melanogaster constitutively over-expressed cyp6g <dig>  regardless of a previous contact with the insecticide  <cit> . in our experimental design it was not possible to distinguish the two scenarios, the constitutive low expression of cyp6g <dig> in resistant individuals or its inhibition after the insecticide treatment. the analysis of individual levels of the cyp6g <dig> transcript will shed light to this question. contrary to these findings in d. melanogaster, a lack of correlation between cyp6g <dig> expression and ddt resistance was observed in other studies  <cit> . our results add yet more complexity to this debate. a putative ortholog to cyp6g <dig> was substantially down-regulated in nws resistant individuals and this is the first report of down-regulation of this cyp gene possibly associated with insecticide resistance. these intriguing cyp6g <dig> results motivate further investigations to understand the involvement of this gene in insecticide resistance.

it has been previously reported that some organophosphate insecticides require an oxidative biotransformation into more toxic structures that inhibit acetylcholinesterase, a process that is mediated by some p <dig> enzymes  <cit> . in such cases, a decrease of the expression levels of these cyp genes would be an advantage in the presence of an op insecticide by preventing its bioactivation by p <dig> enzymes. although this seems a reasonable explanation for our observed decrease in gene expression, it may not apply to the op we used  because its structure already contains the phosphate  biologically active as ache inhibitors  <cit> . nonetheless, the possible involvement of a reduced level of a p <dig> enzyme with insecticide resistance brings about a discussion on the use of synergistic compounds like pbo that inhibit p <dig> and esterase  <cit> . our results are in line with previous studies indicating these synergists should be used with caution as in some concentrations they could reduce the insecticide efficacy  <cit> .

an alternative explanation to this observation is the genetic linkage between the e <dig> mutant allele and the allele associated with low-expression levels of cyp6g <dig>  in this case, the difference in cyp6g <dig> expression levels between the control and resistant samples may have resulted from the selection of cis- or trans-acting regulatory variants linked to the selected e <dig> allele. a third possible scenario for the observed changes in expression levels of cyp6g <dig> involves the alternative splicing of this gene in the presence of the insecticide  <cit> . it is possible that we measured the expression  of exons that are skipped in the presence of the insecticide.

contrary to our expectations, none of the  <dig> genes analyzed showed an increased expression level in the resistant screw-worms. considering all p <dig> s, gsts and cces found among in c. hominivorax characterized transcripts, we analyzed only some genes putatively associated with metabolic resistance and, therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that other genes are involved in the insecticide resistance in this species. rna sequencing is a promising approach for identifying novel genes involved in insecticide resistance and it is a natural follow-up to our analysis. nonetheless, it is possible that the insecticide concentration we used  was too high to allow the metabolic resistance based on the over-expression of hydrolyzing enzymes. this high pressure has selected only individuals that are homozygous for the w251s allele of the e <dig> gene. this result, associated with the population survey  <cit> , represents a strong evidence that altered carboxylesterase e <dig> is the major mechanism of op insecticide resistance in nws. therefore, the identification of mutations in e <dig> gene in nws natural populations can provide important information regarding susceptibility to some class of insecticides and contribute to implement more effective strategies for nws control.

CONCLUSIONS
by using  <dig> pyrosequencing we have sampled screwworm transcribed sequences more deeply than has been previously done, providing a large database of protein coding genes. this database is a rich resource, paving the way for future functional studies involving c. hominivorax and other calliphoridae species.

we used this database to investigate the molecular base of the op resistance in nws fly. absence of mutations in the target site indicates that metabolic resistance mechanisms have evolved preferentially in this species. although no carboxylesterase e <dig> over-expression has been verified, high correlation between mutation w251s in this gene and resistant phenotypes strongly suggests involvement of this enzyme in dichlorvos metabolism. real-time pcr revealed that cyp6g <dig> is notably under-expressed in resistant individuals. further empiric studies by using rna interference could confirm the role of these genes in the resistance phenotype. although resistance is an inevitable consequence of intensive insecticide use, a better understanding of its genetic basis may help us to implement effective management strategies to control insect pests and reduce damage resulting from their infestations.
