BACKGROUND
phylogeography and historical demography play crucial roles in explaining species distributions and are instrumental in revealing episodes of fragmentation and subsequent expansions connected to environmental and climatic fluctuations  <cit> . most phylogeographic research has been focused on the northern hemisphere, often linked to the pleistocene glacial cycles. our knowledge of biogeographical patterns and processes in the southern hemisphere is relatively poor  <cit> , and it is especially marked in non-forest biomes. in sub-saharan africa studies on large mammals living in savannah have identified large-scale phylogeographic patterns and provided a basic understanding of the major biogeographic regions at a continental scale  <cit> , though studies with small-scale resolution are still rare  <cit> .

in africa, pleistocene climatic fluctuations have resulted in more arid conditions during glacial periods, as large masses of water were deposited in continental glaciers, alternating with more mesic conditions during interglacials . thus african ecosystems have undergone a series of aridification events, accompanied by spreading savannah habitats, since the pliocene, with relatively wetter periods between  <dig> - <dig>  mya,  <dig> - <dig>  mya and  <dig> - <dig>  mya  <cit> . further aridification is documented in the late pleistocene and, notably, the last interpluvial  was coincident with a series of extreme droughts in eastern africa  <cit> . studies on large savannah-dwelling mammals demonstrated their less pronounced phylogeographic structure and high level of genetic variation in southern africa, suggesting a long-standing persistence of large savannahs in this part of the continent . however, research from temperate areas in the northern latitudes led to understanding that large and highly mobile animals are not ideal taxa to specify the location and character of past refugia . on the contrary, species with very low dispersal ability and strong dependence on particular habitat have provided much more detailed picture of phylogeographical patterns and processes, for example the identification of unexpected cryptic refugia  or “refugia within refugia” .

killifishes  are an ancient fish clade with a predominantly gondwanan distribution and high species richness in africa  <cit> . african killifish  include several clades that show radiations in specific habitat conditions, such as small rain forest streams, margins of large rivers or brackish zones  <cit> . a notable clade, comprising the genus nothobranchius  from east africa and related monotypic genera pronothobranchius and fundulosoma from west africa, has adapted to a unique environment of temporary savannah pools  <cit> . the pools inhabited by nothobranchius are completely separated from river systems and typically not inhabited by other fishes except lungfish . the pools are strictly seasonal and filled with rainwater at the beginning of the rainy season. pools desiccate during the dry season, with the duration of pools depending on local climate and ranging from 3–11 months  <cit> . in some years, a major flooding may connect several pools via flooded savannah and may also connect pools with intermittent streams, though such events appear to be rare. importantly, specific soil conditions  are necessary for the occurrence of nothobranchius  <cit> , limiting dispersal and occurrence of nothobranchius across the savannah to specific habitat patches. therefore, population processes affecting genetic structure of nothobranchius are predicted to be a combination of processes that are unique to nothobranchius and these affecting terrestrial and aquatic taxa.

all nothobranchius species are annual. fish hatch soon after a pool fills with water  <cit> , grow rapidly, achieve sexual maturity within a few weeks  <cit> , and reproduce daily thereafter  <cit> . adult lifespan is limited by habitat desiccation, with the following generation surviving in the form of diapaused embryos in desiccation-resistant egg envelopes encased in dry mud  <cit> . populations of nothobranchius seldom co-occur with other teleost fish species  <cit> . dispersal by nothobranchius may be limited to occasional large-scale floods in years with unusually high rainfall, which may transport live fish among savannah pools. alternatively, eggs encased in mud may be carried attached to the bodies of large herbivores, as reported for aquatic invertebrates and macrophytes  <cit> , or possibly by waterbirds.

here we use nothobranchius furzeri jubb to investigate phylogeographic patterns and demographic processes in this group of annual, savannah-adapted fish. its rapid development, short lifespan and age-dependent deterioration of physiological functions have made it a valuable vertebrate model organism in ageing research  <cit> . in contrast to that, little is known about natural populations  <cit> . nothobranchius furzeri is distributed in southern mozambique  <cit> , with a single locality known in zimbabwe   <cit> . within its geographical range this species is restricted to pools associated with vertisol soils, while it is absent from pools associated with sandy and lateritic soils  <cit> . previous research on the phylogenetic relationships of mozambican nothobranchius included samples from several n. furzeri populations  <cit> . the mitochondrial marker coi  suggested high spatial structuring within the range of all species investigated, but the three nuclear sequences used in the study  had insufficient power to resolve intraspecific relationships.

here, we provide the first detailed study of the phylogeographic patterns and demographic processes in n. furzeri, covering the entire distribution range of the species using a combination of mitochondrial gene cytb  and  <dig> nuclear microsatellite markers. specifically, we tested following hypotheses:  n. furzeri is composed of three reproductively isolated clades , with no secondary contact among them.  the main divergence was influenced by plio-pleistocene climate changes with allopatric diversification due to savannah fragmentation during pluvials.  the populations of savannah-dwelling nothobranchius fishes have expanded during last interpluvial, together with their preferred habitat.  genetic diversity will be lower and genetic structure higher on the range periphery, where populations are exposed to more frequent extinction-recolonization processes associated with strong genetic drift.

methods
sampling
fish were collected during  <dig> field trips between  <dig> and  <dig>  visiting  <dig> individual savannah pools across southern and central mozambique, with the aim of sampling pools across the entire savannah habitat in that region. from a total of  <dig> pools populated by nothobranchius spp.,  <dig> pools were inhabited by n. furzeri, all of them south of the river save . fish were collected using dip and seine nets. species identification took place in the field, and at most sites a small fin clip from the caudal fin was taken and stored in 96% ethanol. only adult fish, clearly identified to species, were sampled. each population sample consisted of fish collected the same day. different populations , however, were collected across study years . there was no major flood between  <dig> and  <dig> that would cause a dispersal of fish or eggs across populations. a subsample of captured fish was stored in 5% formaldehyde or 80% ethanol for further reference and phenotype analyses while most fish were released back into the pool. two grz  specimens were obtained from the breeding stock in leibniz institute for age research, jena, germany. for genetic analysis, n. furzeri populations from  <dig> pools  were selected which cover the entire known species range . adjacent savannah pools were generally omitted, except for two regions where analyses focussed on small-scale structuring. all fieldwork complied with legal regulations of mozambique .

genotyping of microsatellites and mtdna
in total,  <dig> individuals collected at  <dig> localities  were genotyped at  <dig> microsatellite loci in four multiplex pcr sets. pcr products were separated on the abi prism®  <dig> genetic analyzer  and analysed using genemapper® v.  <dig>   . partial mitochondrial gene cytb was amplified using primers fw <dig>  and rev <dig>  designed on the basis of the mtdna sequence of n. furzeri . pcr products were sequenced directly using bigdye terminators v.  <dig>  chemistry  .

analysis of population genetic structure in the distribution range of n. furzeri
• network analysis of mtdna variation

sequence variation in cytb  was visualised as a haplotype network using the median-joining algorithm in network  <dig>   <cit> . all sequences were geo-referenced and the distribution of the main genetic groups was plotted onto map using panmap software .

• fst and structure - microsatellite data

we estimated the proportion of null alleles  at each locus and population in freena  <cit> . linkage disequilibrium among  <dig> polymorphic loci was examined in each population with exact tests using markov chain methods in genepop  <dig>   <cit> . corrections for multiple testing were performed using the false discovery rate  approach. genetic differentiation between sampling sites was quantified by computing pairwise estimators of fst according to  <cit>  and their significance was tested by  <dig> permutations in genetix  <dig>   <cit> . for all analyses based on allele frequencies in populations , two genotyped individuals from captive population grz were removed.

an individual-based bayesian clustering procedure, implemented in structure  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , was used for individual-based assignments to distinct genetic clusters. the bayesian model assumes k  populations with different allele frequencies at a set of independent loci. the program was run with  <dig> independent simulations for each of k from  <dig> to  <dig>  each of  <dig> iterations, following a burn-in period of  <dig> iterations. in all simulations an admixture ancestry model and correlated allele frequency model  was used. the likelihood of k; i.e. ln pr, was used to infer the best number of real populations in the datasets using the method of evanno et al.  <cit> . we also forced the assignments of individuals to clusters beyond the number considered to maximize the posterior probability of the data. this approach was used to reconstruct the hierarchical relationships among populations, as well as to distinguish between historical processes that are likely to shape the structure . the results of  <dig> replicate runs for each value of k were combined using the greedy algorithm of clumpp  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and summary outputs for each value of k were displayed graphically using distruct v.  <dig>   <cit> .

• spatial genetics - microsatellite data

an individual-based spatial approach of bayesian clustering was used to analyze the spatial structure of the genetic data. we employed the methods implemented in baps version  <dig>   <cit> . baps estimates the hidden population substructure by clustering individuals into genetically distinguishable groups based on allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium. a major advantage compared to most other methods is that the number of populations is treated as an unknown parameter that can be estimated from the dataset. we performed  <dig> independent runs examining the spatial clustering of groups of individuals . based on the initial results, we tested specific hypotheses by repeating the analyses for a fixed number of populations .

isolation by distance was analysed by regressing pairwise estimates of fst/ against ln-distance between sample sites  <cit> . mantel tests were used to test the correlation between matrices of genetic differentiation and euclidean distances between sampling sites by  <dig> permutations in genepop. this test was performed for the complete dataset  and separately for the three groups of populations defined by preliminary analyses of mtdna and microsatellite data .

to test particular hypotheses of the genetic connectivity among populations, we used the maximum likelihood approach to estimate the effective population numbers and immigration rates as implemented in migrate v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . we performed the likelihood ratio test  to test the fit of a priori defined scenarios of the gene flow against the full model, assuming n-island migration model. in particular, we considered two migration models. first, we assumed that migration only occurs between neighbouring populations along the axis following the course of the main rivers . second, we assumed that migration only occurs downstream, i.e. from a higher altitude sites to the lower altitude sites .

due to high number of sampling sites in the chefu region, which would make the model computationally too complex, we performed the migrate analysis only in the limps and limpn clades . we were forced to further omit several sites due to their admixture  and position outside the main river axis, given that they impeded the definition of migration scenarios and increased the number of degrees of freedom of the model. hence, the migration matrix was only evaluated for populations  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the limps clade and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the limpn clade; the rank representing upstream to downstream linear transects. migrate was initially run with  <dig> short and  <dig> long chains of default settings. subsequently, the results were used as starting values for extended runs with  <dig> short chains of  <dig> sampled genealogies with  <dig> increment and  <dig> long chains of chains of  <dig> recorded steps and  <dig> increment value and a mixing scheme with temperatures ranging from boiling to cool  and swapping interval of  <dig>  we monitored if independent runs provided consistent results and in the final runs, defined migration scenarios were used as alternative hypotheses for the lrts.

intrapopulation genetic variation and historical demography
• genetic variation and bottleneck - microsatellites

deviations from hardy-weinberg equilibrium  were tested for each locus and population using the markov chain method in genepop. the number of alleles , observed  and expected  heterozygosities were calculated in genetix. allelic richness  corrected for sample size by the rarefaction method  were calculated for each population in fstat  <dig> . <dig>   <cit> .

excess heterozygosity with respect to that expected at mutation-drift equilibrium for the number of alleles present may indicate a genetic bottleneck  <cit> . we estimated the deviation of gene diversity from mutation-drift equilibrium at the local scale, using bottleneck  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . we used a generalized mutation model in which the change in the number of repeat units forms a geometric random variable, with a variance of the geometric distribution fixed to  <dig> , which is likely to be the most appropriate value for microsatellites  <cit> . this estimate was simulated using  <dig> permutations in bottleneck by choosing the two-phase mutation model , with a variance for tpm equal to  <dig>  and a proportion of the stepwise mutation model in tpm equal to  <dig> . the significance of deviation from the expected heterozygosity under mutation-drift equilibrium was determined with a one-tailed wilcoxon signed rank test  <cit>  and the results were corrected for multiple tests using the fdr approach .

• historical demography based on mtdna

demographic analyses assume more or less homogeneous populations. based on preliminary analyses of microsatellites in structure and baps as well as the haplotype network of mtdna and distribution of haplotypes, we defined three genetic groups . for analysis of historical demography, we used the reduced dataset of  <dig> longer mtdna sequences  from individuals collected at  <dig> localities . we also excluded  <dig> individuals from pop <dig>  and a sequence from grz . diversity estimates, i.e. number of polymorphic sites , number of haplotypes , haplotype diversity , nucleotide diversity , the average number of nucleotide differences  and watterson’s estimate of θ  were calculated using dnasp v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

demographic histories of the three groups were evaluated using several approaches. we first estimated the neutrality indices tajima’s d and fu’s fs and ramos-onsins and rozas’s r <dig> statistic  <cit>  in dnasp. they are sensitive to population expansion, contraction and structure and return significantly negative  or small  values in the case of recent population expansion, while population decline and/or structure tend to return positive or high values.

second, we used the dnasp and arlequin  <dig>   <cit>  to reconstruct the histogram of pairwise differences in each clade  to test for non-random distribution of coalescence events in the sample. arlequin was used to test the fit of our datasets to the expectations of the sudden demographic expansion model using the sum of squared deviations between the observed and expected mismatch from  <dig>  parametric bootstrap replicates. under the assumption of the  demographic expansion model the md also permits estimation of the time of onset of population expansion τ . parameter τ was estimated with dnasp using the moment method of rogers  <cit>  assuming the infinite sites model  as well as with arlequin using schneider & excoffier’s method  <cit> , which relaxes the ifm assumption. confidence intervals were obtained by a parametric bootstrap approach based on  <dig> replicates performed in arlequin.

third, we reconstructed demographic history of the main lineages backward in time using the coalescent-based bayesian skyline plot   <cit>  in beast, which infers past population size changes from sequence data  <cit> . analyses were run twice for each lineage using the hky model of sequence evolution, which was an appropriate model within each lineage selected with the jmodeltest  <cit>  under the aic criterion. the mcmc simulations were run with  <dig> million iterations with a sampling increment of  <dig> and results were checked for convergence and stationarity of different runs in tracer  <dig> . <dig> and combined in logcombiner  <dig> . <dig> module.

dating of divergence
to estimate the divergence times of the major phylogroups we reconstructed the time-calibrated tree in beast using the dominant  haplotypes from each clade and single sequence of closely related species n. kadleci, n. orthonotus and n. rachovii. the tree was rooted with aphyosemion herzogi . an appropriate model of sequence evolution  was selected with the jmodeltest  <cit>  and implemented in beast with jeffreys prior for substitution rates. divergence times were estimated under a yule branching process with a constant speciation rate as a tree prior and assuming an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock  <cit> . a normally distributed prior with a mean of  <dig>  and standard deviation of  <dig>  was used for the mean mutation rate, since it covered the plausible range of  <dig> – <dig> % substitutions per site per my, as discussed in  <cit> . the search started with a upgma tree and two independent runs of 3× <dig> generations were conducted with sampling every 1000th generation. the results were checked for convergence and stationarity using tracer and combined in logcombiner after a burn-in of the first 10% of generations. finally, the molecular clock tree was summarised using the treeannotator  <dig> . <dig> module, using the medians as node heights. given the lack of an internal calibration point, divergence time estimates are likely overestimates of the real time due to the tendency of τ to artificially antedate recent events  <cit> .

RESULTS
genetic diversity of local populations
the mean frequency of microsatellite null alleles per population was less than 5% for all but one locus. however, even for this locus  the mean frequency of null alleles was low  and we did not consider null alleles as a problem in subsequent population genetic analyses . the microsatellite loci used in our study can be considered to be unlinked. from  <dig> results of genotypic linkage disequilibrium tests , only  <dig> were significant at p <  <dig> . most pairs of loci were significantly linked only in one or two populations. only two pairs showed significant linkage in four  populations , which is consistent with their position in the same linkage group , i.e. exhibiting an inter-marker distance of  <dig> and 5 cm in n. furzeri grz strain  <cit> .

most populations  showed deviance from hwe, when calculated over all loci. in most cases deviations from hwe were caused by null alleles present at an increased frequency at some loci and populations. the mean frequency of null alleles for  <dig> locus-population tests significant after fdr correction  was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % , while for the whole dataset the mean frequency of null alleles was only  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . in most populations, the hw disequilibrium was caused by just one or two loci. the only exceptions were peripheral populations pop <dig> and pop <dig>  which showed a deficit of heterozygotes at four loci, suggesting an increased level of inbreeding .

all measures of intrapopulation genetic variation  were strongly correlated  and we describe only the distribution of ar. the range of ar was  <dig> - <dig>  . the most variable populations were usually located in the centres of the distribution of the three main genetic groups. the lowest estimates of ar were encountered in sites at the periphery of their distribution . these local populations  are likely to represent recent founder effects, supported by the results of bottleneck tests, where the only population with a significant heterozygosity excess  was pop <dig>  indicating recent decrease in effective population size . the diversity of mtdna at these localities was also low with the only haplotype at pop <dig>  and two haplotypes differing by 1 bp substitution at pop <dig>  and pop <dig> .

spatial genetic structure over the entire distribution range of the species
median-joining network analyses of  <dig> cytb sequences  revealed  <dig> different haplotypes from two main genetic groups, likely associated with discrete river basins . the first, northern group was found to inhabit savannah pools across the basin of the intermittent river chefu. within this haplogroup, three haplotypes  formed a separate lineage, distributed in the easternmost region of the n. furzeri distribution . the second, southern group was clearly subdivided into northern  and southern  subgroups, with the river limpopo representing possible barrier. the limps group contains pools located within the basins of the limpopo and incomati rivers. population  <dig> likely represents an example of secondary contact between the chefu and limpn mtdna haplogroups. from six individuals, two had haplotype h <dig>  which is frequent in limpn populations. however, four individuals expressed private haplotypes for this population, h <dig> and h <dig>  which belong to the chefu haplogroup . sequencing a shorter fragment  of cytb in nine additional individuals  revealed the same proportion of chefu and limpn haplotypes; six individuals possessed chefu haplotypes and three individuals the limpn haplotypes.

based on microsatellite data, n. furzeri in the study area is genetically structured . only five of  <dig> pairwise fst were not significant  and these five pairs were all geographically close to each other in the centres of their respective haplogroup ranges. on the other hand, the three closest populations  were significantly different, with fst values from  <dig>  to  <dig> . there were even extremely high pairwise fst between neighbouring populations  suggesting important barriers to gene flow over short distances and/or strong effect of genetic drift.

the most supported division in bayesian clustering in structure was for k =  <dig>  but suitable models according to Δk <cit>  are also represented by k =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . in the model for k =  <dig>  the clustering of populations was congruent with the two main mtdna haplogroups  and, similarly, for k =  <dig> the populations around the river limpopo roughly diverged to limps and limpn . further increases in the number of presumed clusters led to separation of other populations, most often in peripheral parts of the distribution of the three main genetic groups . population  <dig>  with individuals belonging to the two mtdna haplogroups , is genetically homogenous on nuclear microsatellites  suggesting that there is no reproductive isolation between the two mtdna lineages.

a similar pattern of genetic structure was observed in the spatial analysis in baps . the best model identified  <dig> genetic populations, which are almost identical to those in structure for k =  <dig> . the main divergence is between northern  and southern  populations . further increase in the number of clusters led to separation of peripheral populations in all three main groups and separation of left and right banks of the river limpopo  .

the genetic distance between populations was correlated with their geographic distance, when all populations were analysed together . when populations were separated into the three main genetic groups, the ibd pattern remained significant only in the chefu populations , despite the same trend observed in both limpn  and limps . this pattern was strongly influenced by the genetic distinctiveness of peripheral populations in all three groups, mainly populations  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in chefu, limpn, and limps, respectively .

the analysis of genetic connectivity for limps and limpn clades in migrate is summarized in table  <dig>  all alternative hypotheses always provided significantly lower fit than the full model . this demonstrates that genetic connectivity in both clades strongly deviate from a simple stepping-stone migration model and from a model assuming strictly downstream migration. a further support comes from the fact that the full models indicated that all localities received non-negligible immigration rates from non-neighbouring sites and that several localities in both clades received considerably higher immigration rates from sites located at lower altitude than from any of the upstream sites .

 limps clade;  limp n clade. numbers in bold along the diagonals indicate θ  estimates, while other numbers indicate the estimates of immigration rates from respective sites . upper indices relate to the alternative hypotheses tested through the lrt.  <dig> indicates those parameters, which were constrained to zero in the model assuming only downward migration, while  <dig> indicates those constrained to zero in the stepping-stone model. elevation of particular localities is shown in parentheses.

historical demography based on mtdna
comparison of mtdna variation among the three main genetic groups and the results of neutrality tests are shown in table  <dig>  all populations significantly fitted the model of sudden growth according to ssd analysis in arlequin and showed a unimodal pattern . bayesian skyline plots indicated moderate  to intensive  population growth in all three genetic groups . this finding is consistent with neutrality tests that showed a non-significant signal for population growth in the limps and limpn clades , while all tests indicated highly significant deviations from neutrality in the chefu clade . the τ values from dnasp suggested more recent population expansions compared to estimates by arlequin, which conforms to a previously reported tendency of the moment method to underestimate the true values  <cit> . nonetheless the dnasp estimates were always included within the 90% ci of arlequin . arlequin analysis was congruent with the bsp analysis and indicated a more recent population expansion in the chefu group  compared to two limpopo groups  . this timing is comparable to that suggested by the bsp analysis .

divergence times among dominant haplotypes in clades

discussion
we demonstrated a deep and ancient division of n. furzeri populations into two major clades, likely associated with river basins . finer subdivision of the southern clade is facilitated by the river limpopo, which apparently serves as a barrier to gene flow between the two subclades. within clades, high genetic structuring of populations inhabiting individual pools likely stems from limited dispersal between pools and frequent founder effects and bottlenecks. significant isolation by distance within main genetic groups suggests that dispersal occurs in small steps. genetic connectivity analysis further demonstrated frequent migration to the higher altitude, discounting hypothesis that dispersal is strictly related to major floods associated with river routes. demographic analyses revealed ongoing expansion of the main clades from their putative refugia.

historical processes and evidence for two savannah refugia
the existence of two major clades of n. furzeri was unambiguously confirmed by both mitochondrial and nuclear markers. this division suggests a historical split of n. furzeri populations between two refugia. based on current genetic diversity at microsatellite markers and haplotype distribution, the first refugium was probably located in the central chefu basin. the second refugium is hypothesised to have been located in the left bank of the limpopo, in the region between the confluences of the limpopo with the rivers olifantes and chefu . the estimated divergence time of  <dig>  mya places the divergence event within a period during the pliocene characterised by a relatively warm and humid climate  <cit> . such climatic conditions may have resulted in fragmentation of savannah biome into discrete units separated by widely distributed forests and forested areas may have played an important role in splitting the range of n. furzeri into two refugia. populations of n. furzeri may have expanded during continuous aridification of the region at the end of pliocene and during cold and dry periods of pleistocene, when the open savanna conditions had become more prevalent  <cit> . in one of these dry periods, the fish from the southern refugium probably colonized the right bank of the river limpopo, including the pools belonging to incomati river basin. interestingly, there are no apparent morphological differences between the isolated clades, except for the relative proportion of male colour morphs  <cit> , though a rigorous comparative morphological study is lacking.

the river chefu  is at present a relatively small river, with a large portion of the river bed dry for much of the year, including an extensive period of the rainy season . the area forms a large pan confined by hills in the south-west and the river save basin in the north . to the east the catchment is separated from the indian ocean by a series of parallel ridges, effectively forming an enclosed basin and indicating a potential existence of a large lake in mesic periods . while pedological and palynological data are lacking, the existence of grassland  savannah, flat topography, sandy soils and numerous temporary lakes in that area lead us to speculate that an extensive region of the south-eastern part of the chefu basin may have been continuously flooded during wetter climatic periods and formed an effective barrier to n. furzeri dispersal.

the distribution of genetic variation suggests further splitting of southern lineage at an estimated time of  <dig> mya. dating of this event corresponds with the last wet period in the african climate record , followed by a further aridification in late pleistocene  <cit> . well developed riverine forests along limpopo river may have functioned as an efficient barrier to gene flow for savannah-dwelling animals, as documented for rodents of the genus aethomys <cit> . thus, unusually for a fish, a large river  has formed a barrier to gene flow between populations. rivers, including their margins and active alluvium, represent an inhospitable environment for nothobranchius and dispersal across the main channel may be an extremely rare event. an analogous pattern has been described for riverine cichlid fish from the lower congo basin, where powerful rapids in the main river form a strong barrier to dispersal between shallow-water cichlids species, effectively isolating populations on opposite banks of the river  <cit> .

we identified a single population with secondary contact between the chefu and limpopo groups , where mtdna haplotypes from both haplogroups were unambiguously identified, while nuclear markers revealed no intrapopulation genetic structure , suggesting a lack of reproductive isolation between the two mtdna clades. interestingly, our transect sampling at the other potential contact zone between the two major groups identified a region where group-specific populations occur only 11 km apart , with no evidence of secondary contact despite intensive sampling in that region and no clear geographical or geological barrier. whether this region is only an arbitrary location where distribution of the two clades is bordering or whether it represents putative suture zone  needs to be confirmed by studies of other taxa. suture zones, where clades from separate refugia meet, are congruent among taxa in europe and north america  <cit>  and have also recently been confirmed for savannah-dwelling mammals in africa, separating eastern and southern savannah regions  <cit> . it is notable that despite a putative pliocene divergence , there is no reproductive barrier between the two clades, as indicated by microsatellite data for pop <dig>  in contrast, similarly old divergence events have led to speciation in several taxa in the northern hemisphere  <cit> , murid rodents of sudanian savannah in western africa , and intralacustrine radiations of cichlid fishes in african lakes  <cit> ).

demographic analysis: contemporary processes
our data indicate that individual n. furzeri populations are subject to strong fluctuations in size, extinctions, and recolonizations, suggesting a strong metapopulation structure over an evolutionary time scale. these conclusions are based on evidence for recent genetic bottlenecks, low allelic richness and hardy-weinberg disequilibria, particularly in populations at the periphery of the range. strong geographical structuring, with significant fst values, even between adjacent populations that are separated by  <dig>  km of flat woodland savannah habitat, suggests that dispersal between pools is a rare event on an ecological time scale.

dispersal of n. furzeri populations across savannah is slow and likely to be accomplished through longer-term geological events at the larger scale. propagules of a large number of aquatic invertebrates and macrophytes have been reported to be effectively dispersed by large herbivores  <cit>  or water birds, though a hypothesis for the animal-mediated dispersal of nothobranchius eggs encased in mud over longer distances appears unlikely given the limited contact between the clades and populations. similarly, dispersal aided by waterbirds would result in weaker geographical structuring. on the other hand, genetic connectivity analysis clearly demonstrated that dispersal is not unidirectional and propagules  from the lower altitude sites sometimes colonize higher altitude pools. this may indicate animal-mediated dispersal on short distances. at present, these ambiguous outcomes make nothobranchius dispersal mode elusive, but a further insight may be provided by ongoing analysis of sympatric congeners.

the chefu group, with strong isolation by distance, a star-like haplotype network, and decreasing genetic diversity from the centre to the periphery of its range has all the attributes of an expanding population, supported by analysis of its historical demography. this expansion is dated to begin approximately 160– <dig> kya, corresponding to a very dry phase in the african climate , and predating a series of extreme droughts reported from eastern africa  <cit> , which resulted in the disappearance of several large lakes such as lake victoria  <cit> . weaker, but comparable, signals of an expansion indicate a similar pattern for the two limpopo groups.

consequences of genetic structure for ageing research
nothobranchius furzeri represents an emerging model for ageing research and different captive strains of n. furzeri of different geographic origin show large differences in captive lifespan and senescence rates  <cit> . our study confirms that populations of n. furzeri are strongly structured and suggests that two large groups represent ancient clades. this finding contrasts with other fish genomic models   <cit>  which are genetically less diversified despite their greater morphological variability. the current range of n. furzeri spans a strong cline in environmental conditions. more arid conditions are found in the chefu river basin where savannah pools are filled with water for a shorter period, while relatively more mesic conditions are found in the southern part of its range  <cit> . we demonstrated that both main n. furzeri clades have ranges encompassing a substantial variation in environmental conditions, making comparative studies possible at two levels of divergence. as genome sequencing of n. furzeri is underway  <cit>  and genomic regions controlling simple traits have been mapped by linkage analysis  <cit> , an intriguing possibility includes comparative genomics aiming at identifying genetic variation associated with different lifespans  <cit> .

availability of supporting data
sequences of cytb of  <dig> individuals of n. furzeri were submitted to genbank , and microsatellite dataset was deposited to the database dryad .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we provide the first detailed analysis of the phylogeographic patterns and demographic processes in a short-living fish n. furzeri, a newly emerging model in aging research. by using the comprehensive sampling covering the entire distribution range of the species and by a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers we demonstrated:  ancient  divergence between the two main n. furzeri lineages, their recent secondary contact and lack of reproductive isolation;  important genetic structuring attributed to the fragmented nature of their environment and isolation-by distance, suggesting that dispersal is limited, occurs over short distances and is not directly associated with river routes;  an apparent role of the river limpopo as a barrier to dispersal and gene flow.
