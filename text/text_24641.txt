BACKGROUND
chlamydia trachomatis is an intracellular bacterium that can multiply only within a host cell. reticulate bodies  are the replicating form of chlamydia bacteria that transform into infectious elementary bodies  prior to cell lysis. the transformation from a fragile rb to a robust eb is dramatic: the size reduces from  <dig> μm to  <dig>  μm, the dispersed chromatin aggregates into a condensed nucleoid and metabolism ceases.

c. trachomatis is classified into  <dig> serotypes  based on the major outer membrane protein  where a-c cause trachoma, d-k cause urogenital infections and l1-l <dig> cause lymphogranuloma venereum .

hc <dig> and hc <dig> are dna-binding proteins, homologous to eukaryotic histone h <dig>  <cit>  which are thought to mediate the chromatin compaction. these histone-like proteins are encoded by the hcta and hctb genes that are expressed late in the life cycle when rbs convert to ebs  <cit> . the hcta gene has been inserted into escherichia coli and the expressed hc <dig> was shown to induce a compaction of chromatin into a spherical condensed nucleoid  <cit> . hc <dig> also condenses dna but the nucleoid is distinctly different with a more thoroid shape  <cit> , indicating that these proteins interact with dna in different ways. both proteins are able to repress transcription, but hc <dig> has a higher binding affinity for rna and thus represses translation more efficiently than hc <dig>  <cit> .

the hc <dig> protein has two domains: the conserved n-terminus  <cit> , which mediates dimerisation, and the lysine-rich c-terminus, which is responsible for dna binding  <cit> . hc <dig>  on the other hand, varies in size between serovars because of varying numbers of lysine-rich pentameric repeats  <cit> . hc <dig> appears to be ubiquitous in chlamydiaceae because the hctb gene has been found in all available genome sequences of this family, based on southwestern blot analysis, hc <dig> has previously been reported to be absent or present in reduced amounts in chlamydophila psittaci strain mn  <cit> . however, the hctb gene has been found in c. psittaci strain 6bc by whole genome sequencing .

the hctb gene encoding hc <dig> is one of the targets in a newly developed multilocus sequence typing  system for c. trachomatis  <cit> . studies of trachoma, lymphogranuloma venereum , the swedish variant with plasmid mutated strains  <cit>  and other genotyping studies have used this mlst system and the corresponding hctb sequences are stored in a publically-accessible mlst database  <cit> .

when comparing hctb sequences from many c. trachomatis specimens it was clear that the size variation was more complex than could be attributed to simple deletions of a pentamer as previously described. in this study we found elements of  <dig> bp that are deleted and duplicated within the hctb gene without a premature stop codon or loss of the reading frame. we have created a nomenclature to characterise the variation in numbers and type of these elements observed in  <dig> clinically derived and reference specimens of c. trachomatis.

RESULTS
hc <dig> in c. trachomatis
 <dig> hctb gene variants were found among  <dig> sequences in the mlst database, with the highest level of variation occurring in a region encoding consecutive amino acid pentamers. the pentamers have two positively charged residues  and three other residues that are mainly alanine, but also valine, threonine and proline . the pentamers result in evenly distributed positive charges throughout the hc <dig> protein, except for the c-terminal domain . this charge distribution is in contrast to the dna-binding c-terminal domain of hc <dig> that has a random distribution of positive charges. the c-terminal domain of both hc <dig> and hc <dig> lack negatively charged residues.

analysis of the amino acid sequence revealed that there was a repetitive structure within hc <dig>  with repetitive elements of  <dig> amino acids built up by six pentamers and one hexamer . the repetitive region in hc <dig> is 72- <dig> amino acids long and has from two to four repetitive elements. repetitive elements with deletions of 1- <dig> hexamer/pentamers are relatively rare though elements of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acids have been found.

a nomenclature was devised that enabled classification of the repetitive elements into  <dig> groups  based on the protein sequence  and  <dig> subgroups  based on silent substitutions at the nucleotide level. there are  <dig> combinations of repetitive elements at the protein level  and  <dig> configurations at the nucleotide level  of hc <dig> based on the  <dig> specimens in the mlst database . the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> elements have a characteristic alanine-threonine instead of threonine-alanine in the first pentamer  compared with other elements, and they are always first of the elements in the repetitive region. the other major types of repetitive elements are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that are separated by three amino acid substitutions. the 8- <dig> elements are shorter forms of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with deletions of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids.

the amino acid sequence outside the variable region is highly conserved with no insertions or deletions. the beginning of the gene encodes  <dig> amino acids with two substitutions; one of these substitutions is restricted to the b , d, g, h, i, ia, j and k serovars while the other is found in some trachoma strains. the last  <dig> amino acids of hc <dig> downstream of the variable region are therefore partly excluded in mlst typing analysis. the only differences in sequence found in the  <dig> bp obtained with mlst sequencing are two substitutions that both cause a change in amino acid. one substitution was unique for the d, g, h, j and k serovars and one was found only in a trachoma strain. additional sequencing was done in order to cover the last  <dig> bp of the hctb gene for  <dig> strains representing different types of hc <dig>  only three variable positions were found. two substitutions, of which one is silent, separate the lgv serovars from the others and one silent substitution is unique for the d, g, h, j and k serovars.

phylogeny and evolution of repeat elements
the phylogenetic analyses of the repeat elements  and of the mlst target including hctb , together show that the evolution of the hctb variants is characterized by a relatively rapid rate of within-genome duplications and deletions of repeat elements and a relatively slow rate of nucleotide substitution.

the phylogenetic tree shows that the hctb gene variants cluster in agreement with disease causing properties. the  <dig> variants of hctb sequences obtained with mlst gave a topology with posterior probability above  <dig>  for four clades, designated i-iv . clade i  contained the trachoma serovar a, b and c strains, but not the genital serovar b . the serovars b , d , g, h, i, ia, j and k were part of an unresolved, basal, grade. clade iii comprised, in addition to the lgv serovars, serovar d , e and f. clade iv  consisted of some of the lgv serovars. the overlapping clade v included all lgv serovars but did not have significant support .

three cases of possible recombination were identified, resulting in four recombined sequences . the sequences with a possible recombined origin are 36_j, 37_j , 12_dhjk and 30_g. removing these sequences from the dataset before bayesian analysis gave the same overall topology , but with an increased number of clades with significant support.

the phylogenetic analysis of the repeat element types  indicated a duplication in the ancestor to c. trachomatis, one copy resulting in the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> group and the other in the group comprising the element types 3- <dig> and 8- <dig>  because the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> elements are always found one per sequence and first in order, the structure can be described as  <dig> + 1- <dig> elements rather than 2- <dig>  mapping this pattern on the hctb phylogeny, the first element  appeared to have evolved by substitutions and deletions only. the  <dig> element for example can have evolved through a series of nucleotide substitutions, or by deletion of the end of a  <dig> element and the beginning of a  <dig> element. the remaining elements  appear to have a much higher rate of duplications and extinction of entire elements. thus in a duplication of a 5b element one copy gave rise to the  <dig> group lineage and the other copy to 5a and subsequently to the  <dig> group lineage of elements, with later duplications and extinctions within both these lineages.

discussion
hc <dig> diversity in c. trachomatis
hc <dig> displays considerable diversity in length and in sequence when comparing  <dig> c. trachomatis specimens. sequence comparisons show that hc <dig> is a highly structured protein with consecutive pentamers but also with repetitions of larger elements built up by six pentamers and one hexamer. these repeated elements were found in  <dig> amino acid variants combined differently resulting in  <dig> configurations and  <dig> length variants of hc <dig> 

the rearrangement of repetitive elements appears to be continuous in c. trachomatis because there are specimens with different configurations of repetitive elements but with identical ompa genotype and mlst profile. the diversity generated by several deletions and duplications while the flanking regions remain intact suggests that the hc <dig> protein is vital for chlamydia, and that the number of repetitions in the dna-binding region has an important role for the organism. it is difficult to link the length of hc <dig> to particular characteristics because many specimens in the mlst database lack additional information such as clinical manifestations and phenotypic differences. this needs further exploration. however, the size variation enabled by rearrangement of the repeated elements might be beneficial for the regulation of dna condensation and gene expression during the transition from rb to eb.

several phylogenetic trees have previously been constructed based on the ompa gene  <cit> . these trees separate the serovars into three groups: b complex , c complex  and the intermediate complex . this classification does not represent biological differences in that both ocular strains and lgv strains are classified into the b and c complex. a phylogenetic analysis based on a concatenated nucleotide sequence from nine housekeeping genes, six intergenic non-coding segments and the porb gene gives a different classification in which the ocular and lgv strains are in separate clades  <cit> . that tree resembles the phylogenetic tree based on hctb, where the ocular strains are found in clade i and the lgv strains in clade v , thus it reflects the biological separation in distinct disease causing groups. interestingly, both trees separate the reference strains for serotype d strains in the same way: d/uw- <dig>  among serovar b , g, h, i, ia, j and k and d/ic-cal <dig>  among serovar e and f.

the hctb gene with its high variability has proven to be a valuable target for discrimination between different c. trachomatis specimens in mlst analysis. for example, specimens with ompa genotype identical to the reference strain e/bour constitute 37-45% in two major swedish genotyping studies  <cit>  and are abundant in the mlst database . however, the hctb gene can discriminate these samples because of ten configurations of  <dig> and  <dig> elements in the repetitive region.

hc <dig> in chlamydiales spp
comparisons of hctb nucleotide sequences for other species in the chlamydiales-order show that they have a similar structure with a region of repetitive elements built up by pentamers  and conserved flanking regions. the hc <dig> sequence from the most closely-related species, chlamydia muridarum, has the highest similarity to c. trachomatis, with three repetitive elements similar to the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> elements. the repetitive elements are shorter in chlamydophila abortus, chlamydophila caviae and chlamydophila pneumoniae but longer in chlamydophila felis and chlamydophila psittaci. no repetitive elements were found in the more distantly related protochlamydial amoeba symbionts protochlamydia amoebophila and protochlamydia naegleriophila, and the pentameric structure was vaguer.

the hctb gene varies within chlamydophila abortus and is one of the targets in a recently developed mlva  genotyping system  <cit> . in contrast, the four available genome sequences of c. pneumoniae are all identical in hctb. c. pneumoniae is difficult to differentiate with highly discriminatory methods   <cit>  and is more conserved than c. trachomatis when using aflp  <cit>  or mlst  <cit> .

hc2-like proteins in other genera
searches in genbank for hc2-like proteins in other genera rendered hits including bordetella , burkholderia , herminiimonas , minibacterium  and ralstonia . these proteins have a similar amino acid composition and similar pentamers, resulting in a distribution of positively charged residues almost identical to hc <dig> .

these proteins vary both in length and repeat structure, and the rearrangement in the encoding genes might be as frequent as in hctb of c. trachomatis. burkholderia, for instance, was found to have  <dig> size variants  among  <dig> sequences from nine species. longer repeats and several different kinds of repeats in the same protein were found in burkholderia ambifaria, burkholderia cenocepacia, burkholderia pseudomallei, burkholderia vietnamensis and burkholderia multivorans. on the other hand, short consecutive repeats of only a pentamer were repeated seven and nine times in bordetella pertussis, bordetella parapertussis and bordetella bronchiseptica. the hc2-like proteins in bordetella petrii and burkholderia phymatum have no repeats. the protein most similar to hc <dig> in c. trachomatis was found in herminiimonas arsenicoxydans  and minibacterium masilliensis with five and four repeats respectively.

studies on the function of proteins similar to hc <dig> have rarely been done in other genera. one exception is the bph <dig> protein in bordetella where consecutive lysine-rich pentamers causes size variation but which, unlike hc <dig>  is expressed during exponential growth and repressed in the stationary phase  <cit> . strains with a knocked out bph <dig> gene have a similar growth rate and phenotype as the wild-type strain, suggesting that this protein is not essential in bordetella. no study on functional differences between strains with shorter or longer bph <dig> has been conducted though bph <dig> in b. pertussis has been reported to vary in size between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids.

CONCLUSIONS
to summarize, the size variation in hc <dig> of c. trachomatis has previously been described as deletions of pentamers, but in the phylogenetic analyses we find a more complex evolutionary pattern of recurring nucleotide substitutions; deletions of elements and within-genome duplication of repeat elements. our study shows that proteins similar to hc <dig> also are present in several other bacterial groups. phylogenetic analysis indicated that the corresponding hctb gene variants cluster in agreement with disease-causing properties. the high sequence variation of hctb provides a suitable target for genotyping of c. trachomatis. the essential dna binding capacity of hc <dig> in the unique biphasic life cycle of chlamydiacae suggests that further experimental studies of dna binding capacity and growth rate would provide increased knowledge about the role of length variation in hc <dig>
