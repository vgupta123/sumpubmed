BACKGROUND
the mononuclear phagocyte system is a family of cells consisting of committed progenitors, circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages  <cit> . the prevailing view that blood monocytes give rise to tissue macrophages in the steady state has been challenged by recent evidence in the mouse that phagocytic cells arising in the yolk sac can populate tissues during development and can be maintained through local proliferation  <cit> . the generation of phagocytes in the yolk sac and their infiltration of the embryo has been demonstrated in the chick  <cit>  and in the mouse . yolk sac-derived macrophages in the chick were shown to enter the developing central nervous system independently of vascularization  <cit> . their origin was confirmed through the use of chick-quail yolk sac chimeras  <cit> . however, the inter-specific chimera system used did not permit full development, so there was no evidence from the chick system as to whether the yolk sac-derived cells were retained post-hatch.

the hematopoietic growth factors macrophage colony-stimulating factor  and interleukin  <dig>  control the proliferation, differentiation and development of mammalian mononuclear phagocytes  <cit> , acting through a common receptor, csf1r. all three molecules are conserved in birds  <cit> . a critical control element in the first intron of the csf1r locus, termed the fms intronic regulatory element  in mammals  <cit>  is also conserved in birds  <cit> . csf1r mrna is detected in the earliest phagocytes in the mouse yolk sac  <cit> . the extreme macrophage deficiency and developmental abnormalities seen in a csf1r-/- mouse embryo  <cit>  suggest that csf <dig> and il <dig> control embryonic macrophage differentiation and, in turn, that these cells are required for normal development.

the contribution of cells that originate in the yolk sac to tissue macrophage populations has been assessed in mice through the use of inducible lineage tracers, and the impact of the knockout of the transcription factor, c-myb  <cit> . however, such studies depend upon the assumption that knockouts and inducers such as tamoxifen do not themselves alter the contribution of the yolk sac by compromising definitive hematopoiesis  <cit> . the chick has been used extensively in developmental biology because of the ease with which cells and tissues can be physically transplanted to allow fate-mapping, an approach made even more straightforward by our development of ubiquitous enhanced green fluorescent protein -expressing chicken lines  <cit> . in the current study we examine the origins of tissue macrophages during embryonic development and the importance of csf <dig> in the control of macrophage proliferation and differentiation in the chicken. the results confirm that csf <dig> is a regulator of the chick mononuclear phagocyte system in vivo. they also suggest that yolk sac-derived macrophages in the chick are relatively short-lived and are substituted by bone marrow-derived macrophages  during development.

RESULTS
comparative rna-sequencing analysis of csf1-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages and embryonic rna
macrophages are a major cell population in the developing mouse embryo, as evident from both in situ hybridization of csf1r and other macrophage-related mrnas  <cit> , and the location of a macrophage-specific csf1r-egfp reporter transgene  <cit> . the visualization of cells expressing csf1r reporter genes  in the chick suggests that embryonic macrophages are just as abundant in this species, but there is limited information on macrophage-restricted mrnas to enable their characterization.

to reveal macrophage-enriched transcripts, we used rna-sequencing  to compare the mrna profiles of bmdm grown in csf <dig> with a pool of e <dig> embryos. the fibroblast line df <dig> was used as a negative control. we identified transcripts with unique annotations, and with an expression threshold of  <dig> tag/million  in the embryo, and created a venn diagram of overlapping expression . around 75% of transcripts detected at  <dig> tpm were represented in all of the libraries. at this threshold, 30% to 40% of transcripts were detected in only one of the two bmdm libraries. we focused on two sets:  <dig> transcripts that were detected in both bmdm libraries and embryo but not in df- <dig>  and  <dig> that were detected only in the two bmdm libraries . the tables show the relative expression in df <dig> cells and embryo compared with bmdm. csf1r mrna was detected in embryos at around 2% of the level found in pure bmdm. assuming similar levels of expression of csf1r mrna in tissue macrophages and bmdm, this would suggest that macrophages contribute around 2% of the total mrna, which is consistent with their apparent abundance. the macrophage-specific transcription factor pu. <dig>  had a similar relative enrichment to csf1r, whilst several other myeloid transcription factors  were less enriched in the bmdm relative to the embryo, most probably because they are expressed in other hemopoietic cells . the macrophage-enriched list also includes many known macrophage-expressed surface proteins, including csf2rb, ccr <dig>  trem <dig>  cd <dig>  mrc <dig>  p2ry <dig>  stab <dig> and tlr <dig>  detected by network analysis of large mouse, pig and human datasets  <cit> . the  <dig> macrophage-expressed genes that were below the  <dig> tpm in embryo are, in fact, detectable. as shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  they were all highly enriched in bmdm relative to df <dig> cells, and include many genes that are macrophage-enriched in mice .figure  <dig>

the origins of embryonic macrophages
embryonic macrophages are first observed in the yolk sac at hamburger-hamilton stage   <dig>  prior to the first appearance of progenitors of chicken definitive hematopoietic stem cells in the ventral floor of the dorsal aorta around hh <dig>  <cit> . recognizable blood islands containing runx1+ hematopoietic progenitors have been detected in hh <dig> embryos but the cells expressing a csf1r-reporter gene appeared in the yolk sac at hh <dig>  these cells were confined to the lumen of primitive blood vessels and their numbers rapidly escalated in the circulation  <cit> . the pattern of emergence is consistent with previous reports of the earliest appearance of macrophages in the chicken embryo  <cit> . we tested the potential of circulating yolk sac-derived cells to differentiate into macrophages in vitro by culturing whole blood from hh <dig> to hh <dig> embryos. in the absence of growth factors, these circulating yolk sac-derived cells failed to survive in culture, whereas they rapidly differentiated into adherent cell monolayers in the presence of csf <dig> . the resulting cells were identified as macrophages based on their phagocytic capacity and expression of csf1r, mhcii and kul <dig> . circulating yolk sac-derived cells were found to have a high proliferative capacity, with macrophages derived from 20 μl of whole blood expanding to approximately 90% confluence in a t <dig> flask after 21 days in culture.figure  <dig>

to test the potential for circulating yolk sac-derived cells to differentiate into macrophages in vivo we injected blood from ubiquitously egfp-expressing stage hh <dig> to hh <dig> embryos into the dorsal aorta of age-matched wild-type embryos. donor-derived egfp+ cells were observed in the yolk sac in all embryonic stages tested and in newly hatched chicks. figure  <dig> shows representative images of a number of locations in embryos receiving transferred cells at different times of subsequent development. egfp+ cells apparently entered the yolk sac compartment . figure 3b shows the large number of egfp+ cells infiltrating the eye, a site of major embryonic macrophage infiltration detected with the csf1r-egfp transgene previously  <cit> , and also observed in mouse csf1r-egfp transgenics  <cit> . as expected, and observed previously in the mouse  <cit> , egfp+ cells were particularly concentrated in regions of programmed cell death, such as the inter-digit region of the limb buds . finally, consistent with the reported ability of yolk sac-derived cells to give rise to microglia  <cit> , cells with the morphology of microglia were still evident in the brain of all birds examined at the time of hatch . we confirmed the phenotype of egfp+ cells in recipient embryos by confocal microscopy. egfp+ cells were variable in morphology, ranging from highly ramified cells in the embryonic mesenchyme to rounded cells in the inter-digit region of limb buds . all egfp+ cells were also labeled by immunohistochemistry with anti-csf1r, and rounded egfp+ csf1r+ cells in the inter-digit region contained the condensed and fragmented nuclei of apoptotic cells. hence, the progeny of the transplanted donor cells were functionally phagocytic in vivo .figure  <dig>

to test the potential for circulating yolk sac-derived cells to contribute to the adult macrophage pool, we again injected blood from ubiquitously egfp-expressing stage hh <dig> to hh <dig> embryos into the dorsal aorta of age-matched wild-type embryos. in three separate experiments a total of  <dig> recipient embryos were injected;  <dig> chickens survived until sexual maturity . in newly hatched chicks, occasional highly ramified egfp+ cells derived from the yolk sac donors were still detectable in the brain. by contrast, no evidence of egfp fluorescence, compared with non-transgenic birds, was detected in any tissue of any adult bird including the brain when viewed as whole mounts or in sections. as a positive control for effective transfer in these hatched birds, egfp+ cells were detected in the testes of recipient males , indicating the presence of cells derived from donor primordial germ cells that were co-transferred along with the yolk sac macrophages in blood derived from stage hh <dig> to hh <dig> embryos  <cit> .

to test the differentiation potential of definitive hematopoietic cells under the same protocol, we injected unfractionated bone marrow from newly hatched egfp-expressing chicks into the circulation of stage hh <dig> to hh <dig> non-transgenic chicken embryos, before the appearance of the intra-aortic hematopoietic stem cell clusters. the workflow for this experiment is shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  in each of three experiments,  <dig> embryos were injected, and hatch rates varied between 36% and 60%. as with the embryonic cell adoptive transfers, the injected embryos were examined for the presence of egfp-expressing cells of donor origin at various stages of embryonic development, and some were also taken to hatch. tissues from these bone marrow chimeras were collected on hatch day, five  <dig> of age and 6 weeks of age for similar examination.

donor bone marrow-derived egfp+ cells invaded the whole embryo as shown in figure 5a. the distribution of egfp-expressing cells in the host embryo was comparable to that observed in csf1r-egfp transgenic chick embryos  <cit> , including in the forming digits . the aggregation of macrophages to form primordia, detected with the csf1r-egfp or csf1r-mapple reporters, is the first sign of the future location of organized lymphoid organs in the chick  <cit> . the bone marrow donor-derived egfp-expressing cells also aggregated in lymphoid tissue primordia of the recipient embryo . the distribution of donor egfp-expressing cells in tissues was examined in post-hatch chimeras by whole mount fluorescence imaging . in contrast with the loss of labeled cells in chicks injected with yolk sac-derived cells, egfp+ cells were so abundant throughout all the tissues examined  that they were easily detected in whole mounts. furthermore, these cells from the donor were still present in the tissues at 6 weeks of age, which was the latest time point examined. they were particularly concentrated in the spleen and bursa of fabricius but less so in the liver, which is not a major site of hematopoiesis during avian development  <cit> . the donor-derived cells were also detected in the brain and skin of all the chimeras generated. the presence of egfp-expressing cells in the thymus of the chimeras implies that bone marrow donor-derived progenitors were still circulating at  <dig>  days of incubation, which is the time of the first influx of hematopoietic cells into the chicken thymus. the thymus ontogeny involves a cyclic succession of receptive and non-receptive periods for stem cell entry into the embryonic and early postnatal thymus  <cit> . to confirm the identity of the bone marrow-derived donor cells that persisted in the brains of the chimeras, coronal sections of the right telencephalon were stained for expression of the leukocyte marker cd <dig> and for csf1r. all of the egfp+ cells also expressed cd <dig> and csf1r, and had the characteristic ramified morphology of microglial cells. additional file 2: figure s <dig> shows one example.figure  <dig> 
bone marrow progenitors give rise to macrophages in the embryo and in adult birds. bone marrow cells from newly hatched egfp+ donors were injected into the yolk sac circulation of hh <dig> non-transgenic recipients as described in methods.  images are representative whole mounts taken under uv illumination at different times and locations during subsequent development, and in different recipients, to provide an indication of the ability of the transplanted cells to populate all locations in the embryo:  whole embryo-e4;  brain cross-section-e5;  hindlimb-e7;  hindlimb digits-e10;  chorioallantoic membrane-e12;  spleen-e13;  femur cross section-e13;  intestine-e <dig>   images are representative whole-mount images of the spleen, liver, bursa of fabricius, thymus, brain and skin of representative wild-type and egfp-bone marrow chimeras at day  <dig>  day  <dig> and 6 weeks of age as indicated. scale bars = 200 μm.



the egfp+ macrophages in post-hatch chimeric birds might derive from local self-renewal of macrophages seeded during development, or from population of the hematopoietic progenitor pools, or both  <cit> . we therefore examined whether injected egfp+ bone marrow cells isolated from newly hatched chicks could contribute to the progenitor pool in the marrow of recipients. the bone marrow of 6-week-old chimeras contained 10% to 20% of egfp+ cells . the egfp+ cells were predominantly large and granular, and expressed high levels of cd <dig>  consistent with their identity as macrophages . this restricted profile suggests that the donor cells can only give rise to the macrophage lineage in the recipient marrow. to confirm the contribution of the donor egfp+ cells to macrophage progenitors, chimeric marrow was cultured in presence of chicken csf <dig> for 7 days. a substantial proportion of the resulting bmdm expressed egfp. the positive cells occurred in large clusters in the cultures, suggestive of colonies derived from a progenitor .figure  <dig>

the level of chimerism in spleens of recipient birds at 6 weeks of age was more difficult to assess. there was an apparent increase in background fluorescence in the chimeric birds. on flow cytometry, the entire fluorescence curve of large granular cells within the spleen was shifted somewhat to the right, perhaps due to the uptake of egfp from dying cells . frozen sections of paraformaldehyde -fixed chimeric spleens were stained using an antibody against the cell surface antigen bu- <dig>  which is expressed on b cells and a subset of macrophages  <cit> . none of the egfp+ cells were positive for bu- <dig>  the level of chimerism in the large granular cell fraction was as high as 45% in two of the birds examined in detail. sustained chimerism was confirmed in the bursa, where the background egfp shift was not observed . in this organ, around 13% of the large granular cells were unequivocally egfp+, whereas amongst small lymphocyte-like fractions the proportion was only 1% to 2%. as in the spleen, the egfp+ cells in tissue sections did not stain for bu-1; indeed, the positive cells were excluded from the b cell follicles. conversely, all of the egfp+ cells in both spleen and bursa were stained with our recently described antibody against csf1r, and were not morphologically distinct from the large pool of stellate interstitial csf1r+ macrophages  <cit> .

the responsiveness of embryonic macrophages to csf1
the ability of donor bone marrow cells to proliferate and differentiate when transplanted into the chick embryo indicates that there is a macrophage-trophic environment. consistent with this view, in situ hybridization and quantitative rt-pcr demonstrated that both csf <dig> and il <dig> mrna were highly expressed in the embryo, especially in the head  at the time of proliferation of the macrophage populations expressing csf1r mrna . to determine whether the availability of csf1r ligands is limiting for macrophage development, we examined the effect of supplementing their availability by direct microinjection. for this purpose, we developed a chimeric chicken csf1-fc fusion protein . a similar construct for pig csf <dig> was found to increase the circulating half-life, because it increases the size of the protein above the renal clearance threshold  <cit> . we assayed the chicken csf1-fc using a chicken csf1r-expressing ba/f <dig> line described previously  <cit>  and found that the addition of the fc component did not alter the relative activity . the macgreen  transgenic reporter chick embryos  <cit>  provided a convenient assay of the effect of csf <dig>  the chicken csf1-fc conjugate was injected into the neural tube of macgreen embryos at hh <dig> and the number of csf1r transgene-expressing cells was evaluated 36 hours later. definitive hematopoietic stem cells appear in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region at hh <dig> so the exogenous csf <dig> injected at this stage might act on both yolk sac and definitive monocyte macrophages. there was no consistent difference in the gross appearance or size of whole embryos injected with chicken csf1-fc and pbs within the time frame examined. however, when whole embryos were viewed as whole mounts, there was a very obvious increase in egfp fluorescence to the extent that the injected embryos were bright green . the apparent increase in egfp fluorescence was not focused at the site of injection, but was manifest throughout the chicken csf1-injected embryos. comparison of sagittal sections through the body and of the footpad  confirmed that the injected chicken csf1-fc did not change the localization or distribution of egfp+ cells, and that the increased egfp fluorescence was associated with an apparent increase in the numbers of egfp+ macrophages in the same locations.

control of macrophage production in newly hatched birds by csf1
increased csf <dig> can cause a large expansion of the monocyte and tissue macrophage populations in mammals, but this has never been studied in birds. we therefore wished to determine whether the availability of csf <dig> remained limiting for the proliferation and differentiation of macrophages in post-hatch life in the chicken. for this purpose, the chicken csf1-fc was injected into macred transgenic reporter chicken hatchlings, in which csf1r control elements drive expression of mapple. there are limited alternative markers for embryonic chick macrophages. expression of the csf1r reporter genes in chick was shown to be coincident with cd <dig>  surface csf1r and staining with lysotracker. their location in regions of high cell death and stellate morphology resemble the distribution of macrophages seen in mouse embryos. in adult birds, all kul01+ cells, including blood monocytes and tissue macrophages also express the reporter gene, but kul <dig> is not a useful marker in the embryo  <cit> . macred hatchlings were dosed subcutaneously with 50 μg chicken csf1-fc or pbs on hatch day , day  <dig>  day  <dig> and day  <dig>  then sacrificed 24 hours after the final injection.

csf <dig> treatment caused a leukocytosis, with a two- to three-fold increase in total white cell count in all treated birds . the fluorescence-activated cell sorting  profiles of the leukocytes are shown in figure 7a. the csf1r-mapple transgene provides a convenient marker for the monocytes. at first glance, it appears that the proportion of monocytes in the blood increased in response to chicken csf1-fc, but this is actually entirely due to the proportional loss of thrombocytes. in the chicken, these cells are nucleated but express relatively low levels of cd <dig> compared to other leukocytes. as shown in figure 7b, the ratio of transgene-positive monocytes to cd45lo thrombocytes was greatly increased by the chicken csf1-fc treatment. conversely, the leucocytosis was not selective for monocytes. indeed, the ratio of monocytes to b cells, t cells, or total cd45hi cells was significantly reduced in the treated birds. a similar pattern has been seen in mammals, including primates, where csf <dig> treatment caused thrombocytopenia, but increased all the white cell populations  <cit> .figure  <dig>

as in the chicken csf1-fc-treated embryos described above, whole mounts of tissues of the chicken csf1-fc-treated birds could be distinguished from control based upon expression of the csf1r-mapple reporter gene. the organs and tissues from the chicken csf1-fc-injected chickens visibly glowed red by comparison to the controls. figure  <dig> shows en face views of skin and rectal mucosa, and a whole mount view of the cecum showing the cecal tonsil, of control and treated chicks. the view of the rectum also highlights the remarkable concentration of csf1r+ macrophages in the lamina propria, as also seen in mice  <cit> . the conclusions based upon the whole mount view were supported in every tissue examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy , where there was an apparent increase in the number of transgene-expressing cells. there also appeared to be an increase in the brightness of expression in individual cells . in the spleen, the transgene expression corresponds to the known macrophage distribution in the white pulp, including inter-digitating dendritic cells and ellipsoid-associated cells, and in the red pulp  <cit> . interestingly, the increase in fluorescent cells in the bursa of newly hatched chicks dosed with chicken csf1-fc was more striking in the macrophage population lining the connective tissue between the b cell follicles than in the population found in the medulla of the follicle, called bursal secretory dendritic cells. in the liver, the increased numbers of transgene-expressing kupffer cells in response to chicken csf1-fc were clustered around sinusoids. a similar response was seen in the lung. transgene-expressing cells were scattered throughout the interstitial tissue of the parabronchial wall in lung from a pbs-treated chick, the increased numbers of transgene-expressing cells in the chicken csf1-fc-treated chicks were not associated with a major change in distribution.figure  <dig>

despite the apparent changes in tissue macrophages in the treated birds, there were no apparent adverse effects, at least in the short time they were examined. the treated and control groups gained weight at equal rates . csf <dig> treatment in mice was reported to cause splenomegaly and to promote liver and kidney growth or repair  <cit> . by contrast, there was no effect on any chicken organ weights in response to chicken csf1-fc. as demonstrated in the defective bone resorption of the op/op mouse, csf <dig> has a crucial role in mammalian bone homeostasis through the differentiation of osteoclasts, the bone resorbing cells  <cit> . conversely, the increased numbers of osteomacs and macrophages caused by the administration of csf <dig> in a mouse tibial bone injury model was associated with increased matrix deposition and enhanced mineralization  <cit> . the femur structure of the pbs- and chicken csf1-fc-treated chicks was therefore analyzed by micro-computed tomography. rather unexpectedly, the treatment increased bone formation. the bones of chicken csf1-fc-treated chicks actually displayed a two-fold higher bone volume to tissue volume than those of pbs-treated hatchlings. furthermore, the trabecular thickness and the trabecular number were also increased in the chicken csf1-fc-treated femurs .figure  <dig>

discussion
the yolk sac is believed to be the major source of progenitors of many mouse tissue macrophage populations, notably the microglia of the brain, based upon lineage trace studies  <cit> . in the present study, we have extended the previous evidence that the developing chicken contains an abundant macrophage population that can be detected by localization of csf1r mrna or novel csf1r reporter genes  <cit> . the patterns of development, migration and localization detected using a csf1r reporter were entirely consistent with previous descriptions of macrophage development in the mouse. our previous generation of recombinant chicken csf <dig>  <cit>  permitted the production of large numbers of pure bmdm from chicken bone marrow. we compared their gene expression to the total gene expression in the embryo. the number of macrophages in the embryo was so high that it was possible with deep-rnaseq analysis to identify macrophage-expressed transcripts against the background of the mrna from numerous other cell types. the chicken genome is still poorly assembled and annotated, and large parts of the sequence  are not even sequenced. consequently, even after the de novo assembly of the tags that did not originally map to the genome, 10% of the new contigs were still not present in the current assembly. these contigs could form the basis of capture sequences to enable further refinement of the genome sequence. the primary sequence data have been provided to a consortium of avian researchers, and used to refine annotation of the chicken genome . as a first approximation, the data demonstrates that tissue macrophages in a developing chick have a similar transcriptome to csf1-stimulated bmdm and, by inference, csf1r mrna and the csf1r reporter expression accurately locates macrophage-like cells. a transcript annotated as the chemokine receptor ccr <dig> is amongst the highly expressed genes shared by bmdm and embryonic macrophages in the chick. this gene is probably not a strict ortholog of mammalian ccr <dig> . because neither the yolk sac cells, nor the bone marrow cells, were pure populations, we cannot eliminate the possibility that there was a quantitative difference in the number of transferred precursor cells. the recent literature from mouse systems, based on the study of lineage trace and myb-knockout mice, has accepted that many yolk sac-derived macrophages persist as a substantial distinct population in the adult  <cit> . by contrast, a recent study by epelman et al.  <cit>  concluded that liver, heart and brain were the only mouse organs in which yolk sac-derived macrophages persist into adulthood in significant numbers, and even then they were a minor subpopulation. as discussed elsewhere  <cit> , our interpretation of the data in mouse and the current data for the chick is that yolk sac-derived and definitive macrophages can occupy the same specific niches and in normal development the cells derived from the yolk sac are replaced by fetal liver or bone marrow monocyte-derived cells.

we have shown that csf <dig> and il <dig> are expressed during chicken embryonic development. by injecting a novel form of recombinant csf <dig>  chicken csf1-fc, into both the developing embryo and the hatchling bird, we have shown that csf1r signaling is limiting for the proliferation and differentiation of tissue macrophages in birds as it is in mammals. inter alia, these observations further highlight the utility of the macgreen and macred reporter genes in the chick to monitor alterations in mononuclear phagocyte number, location and behavior  <cit> . one unexpected effect of chicken csf1-fc in hatchlings was the increase in lymphocytes as well as monocytes, since these cells do not express csf1r. this could arise because of the remarkable concentration of csf1r-expressing cells in white pulp of spleen, and in the bursa. this is not the case in mammals, where macrophages are largely confined to red pulp and marginal zones. it may be that the csf1-stimulated macrophages produce factors that promote lymphocyte proliferation or migration. alternatively, in the mouse, pigcsf1-fc treatment greatly increased tissue macrophage numbers, through both local proliferation and monocyte extravasation  <cit> . so, in the treated chicks, the chicken csf1-fc could act in at least two ways, by promoting proliferation of precursors and tissue macrophages, and by driving the monocytes selectively to leave the circulation.

CONCLUSIONS
data we have presented here support the use of the chick model in the study of monocytopoiesis, and demonstrate that csf1r transgenic reporters will enable the visualization of key events in monocyte-macrophage development.
