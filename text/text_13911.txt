BACKGROUND
in order to understand cell functioning as a whole, it is necessary to describe, at the molecular level, how gene products interact with each other. this could help to identify new target genes and to design new drugs for treatment of several diseases  <cit> . due to the high number of genes involved in these networks, activating or suppressing feedback loops, the dynamics of their interactions is very complex and difficult to infer.

with the development of high-throughput technologies, such as dna microarrays, it is possible to simultaneously analyze the expression of up to thousands of genes and to construct gene networks based on inferences over gene expression data.

several methods to model genetic networks were proposed in the last few years, such as the bayesian networks  <cit> , structural equation models  <cit> , probabilistic boolean networks  <cit> , graphical gaussian models  <cit> , fuzzy controls  <cit> , and differential equations  <cit> .

although these methods allow modeling several regulatory networks for which biological information is available, it is difficult to determine the flow of information when there is no a priori knowledge.

in addition, all of these methods face the same problem, i.e., the number of samples  is very small, when compared to the high number of variables    <cit> . therefore, it is difficult to infer large scale networks using traditional statistical methods, limiting this inference to only a few genes. as a consequence, modeling and simulating large networks becomes a field of intensive and challenging research. at this point, it is important to define what is considered a "large" network. we consider as "large" a network in which the number of genes is larger than the number of microarrays experiments, implying in a large number of parameters to be estimated.

some methods have been developed to overcome this problem. for example, barrera et al. use mutual information for dimension reduction  <cit> , with mutual information between genes being computed and then, the highest mutual informations selected. however, this approach is not founded on a statistical test, rendering it very difficult to interpret and identify the actual edges of the network. therefore, the choice of the threshold parameter to determine whether there is or not a connection, becomes quite subjective. an alternative to model the large number of genes is to construct modules , where each module is composed by several genes, and then, to construct the module-module networks  <cit> . a limitation of these methods is that they still are not a gene-gene network, therefore, interpretation of the meaning of each module is difficult, varying with each cluster.

here we present the sparse vector autoregressive model to approach these problems. this method was first applied, with success, in neurosciences, to estimate functional connectivity between several brain areas  <cit> . here, we present the sparse vector autoregressive model based on lasso penalized regression for variable selection to reduce the dimensionality on large gene networks.

in cases of multiple time series, a first approach to infer connectivity would be to apply techniques such as multivariate autoregressive modeling , which allows identification of connectivity by combining graphical modeling methods with the concept of granger causality  <cit> . this is an attractive approach since it does not require a priori network information. unfortunately, the current time series methods can only be applied only for cases in which the length of the time-series t is much larger than n, the number of genes, which is exactly the reverse of the situation commonly found in microarray experiments, for which relatively short time-series are measured over tens of thousands of genes. the sparse vector autoregressive model , on the other hand, estimates the network in a two-stage process involving  penalized regression with lasso regression  <cit>  and  pruning of unlikely connections by means of the false discovery rate  developed by  <cit> . extensive simulations were performed with artificial gene networks having scale-free like topologies  <cit>  and stable dynamics. these simulations show that the detection efficiency of connections of the proposed procedure is quite high. an application of the method to actual hela cell line data was illustrated by the identification of well known transcription factor targets and circuitries involving important genes in cancer development.

RESULTS
in order to measure the performance of svar, intensive simulations were carried out. for this purpose, we simulated hundreds of networks with scale-free like topology since the metabolic network was described as scale-free graphs by  <cit> . in our case, the graph nodes represent the genes whereas the edges represent the granger-causal relationships. for details of these artificial regulatory networks, see the methods section.

the number of genes was kept at n =  <dig> and we varied the sample size, i.e., the time-series length . notice that, for var of order one, m = t -  <dig> must be larger than n. for each time-series length, we performed  <dig> simulations, i.e.,  <dig> different scale-free like graphs were generated. the starting conditions of the scale-free like graphs were two fully connected genes , in other words, two nodes with two edges, one pointing to the other. the number of edges added at each iteration is z =  <dig>  therefore, each network is composed by  <dig> genes and  <dig> edges out of  <dig>  possible edges . notice that since the goal is to construct a network with n =  <dig> genes, we set the number of iterations tstep = n - z <dig> =  <dig>  in figure  <dig>  an example of the artificially generated gene expression regulatory network is illustrated.

it is important to highlight that svar was able to identify true positive edges even when the time-series length was lower than the number of genes. figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show, respectively, the number of true positives inferred by svar and var for controlled false positives rate, i.e., q-value  thresholds lower than  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . since the estimated β's standard error is proportional to the time series' length  we varied only the time series' length.

analyzing figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  we obtained the following results:

 <dig>  the capacity of svar to identify true positives even when the number of samples is lower than the number of genes is satisfactory. this was found when comparing the performance between svar, with the time-series length equal to  <dig>  and var, with time-series length equal to  <dig>  also, in this case, svar has identified more true positive edges than var .

 <dig>  by comparing svar and var when the number of genes is lower than the number of samples, in general, svar is slightly more powerful than var, since the number of connectivities is larger than the number of samples.

 <dig>  when m ≫ n, where m = t -  <dig> and n is the number of genes, there is no statistical difference between svar and var. this could be explained, in this context, because the best λ which minimizes the gcv  is near to zero. when λ =  <dig>  the svar model becomes the traditional var model.

we have also analyzed the expression profile of a set of  <dig> cell cycle-regulating genes represented by  <dig> microarrays, i.e., the number of genes n is approximately  <dig> times larger than the time-series length t. figure  <dig> shows the genes that display any connectivity under a false-positive rate  of 5% . genes with no connectivity were excluded.

the svar method reveals at least three gene regulatory networks related to cell transformation and tumor progression, namely: nfκb, p <dig>  and stat <dig> transcriptional modules  <cit> , which is in agreement with already well known cell cycle-regulated pathways in several cellular models and in hela cells themselves.

it is important to highlight that the out-degree  of genes encoding proteins that act as well-known transcriptional factors  or important genes for cell proliferation control  is higher than that of other genes. in a similar analysis, the in-degree  of the fgfs  and of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis  is also higher, demonstrating the association between their key role in cell homeostasis and their in-degree and/or out-degree values  <cit> .

nfκb is an inducible transcription factor complex formed by heterodimeric association between rela and c-rel gene products, whose transcriptional activity is regulated by interaction with the inhibitory iκbα protein. it has already been demonstrated that activation of nfκb controls cell-cycle progression in hela cells by several mechanisms  <cit> . the svar method was not able to identify the relationship between nfκb and its natural targets, such as a <dig>  iap, bclx and iκbα genes. however, svar is showing that nfκb directly regulates several fibroblast growth factors  and the c-myc protein, which are key regulators of cell proliferation. indeed, it is noticed that the majority of nfκb transcriptional activity is mediated by interaction with fgfs-related proteins, at the upstream and/or downstream levels. these results support the hypothesis that some of the multiple aspects of tumorigenesis in hela cells may be related to nfκb -mediated transcription of fgfs-related proteins.

as discussed above, the positive nfκb regulation of several well-known natural targets was not detected by svar. however, these regulatory processes appear to be present, even in the absence of an evident direct link with nfκb, since all of these transcriptionally regulated genes form a highly related network . a <dig>  a zinc finger protein, which is transcriptionally regulated by nfκb in several cell types  <cit> , appears to orchestrate the genes relationship in this network, activating the transcription of well-known anti-apoptotic genes, such as iap, bclx and junb – nfκb target genes themselves  <cit>  – towards transduction of the proliferative transcriptional activity of nfκb. the a <dig> protein is also involved in nfκb regulation, blocking its activity, in a negative feedback mechanism  <cit> . although this control is operated at the post-transcriptional level, results obtained using the svar method suggest that this process could also be controlled by a20-mediated positive regulation of iκbα . these results confirm the reliability of svar for predicting gene relationship, since iκbα, the natural nfκb inhibitor has a key role in controlling the nfκb -regulated cell cycle events in hela cells, as referred to in literature  <cit> . moreover, svar showed that this role of iκbα in hela cell cycle progression also appears to be regulated through p53-mediated activation of iκbα , in agreement with data reported in the literature  <cit> . in summary, these data support the hypothesis that iκbα may be involved in attenuation of tumor progression and be responsible for the mildly invasive phenotype displayed by hela cells.

the p <dig> protein is a transcription factor that binds to the enhancer/promoter elements of downstream target genes and regulating their transcription and initiating cellular programs that account for most of its tumor-suppressor functions, namely: cell cycle arrest, inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis, apoptosis induction and dna repair  <cit> . the svar method was capable of identifying the interactions of several members of the p <dig> network. igf-bp <dig> , an inhibitor of insulin-like growth factor, and noxa, a bcl- <dig> homology domain 3-only  protein, are transcriptionally activated by p <dig> in activation of apoptosis in several cell types  <cit> . our in silico results showed that this regulation is also present in hela cells. although the fas gene is not a known target of p <dig>  its activation could be mediated by other p <dig> targets, leading to increased apoptosis rate and cell proliferation control. on the other hand, svar showed that bai- <dig> and tsp- <dig> genes are induced by the p <dig> gene product in hela cells. it is known that the bai- <dig> gene codes for a member of the secretin receptor family, which contains at least one functional p53-binding site within an intron, and its product is postulated to be an inhibitor of angiogenesis and a tumor growth suppressor  <cit> . similarly, the tsp- <dig> gene codes for an adhesive glycoprotein that mediates cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions and has been shown to play a role in platelet aggregation, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis  <cit> . taken together, the p53-mediated upregulation of bai- <dig> and tsp- <dig> genes may be a mechanism to evade cell migration and angiogenesis, features which are commonly absent in hela cells. we noticed that the classical p <dig> targets, such as gadd <dig> and p <dig>  do not appear to be directly regulated by p <dig> in the svar analysis . this may be explained by the fact that the time-series length is not large enough. it is important to note that our previous study applying dvar   <cit> , it was possible to identify these connectivities.

the observed p53-independent transcriptional regulation of the p <dig> gene , appears to be unrelated to cell cycle arrest, as discussed below.

the stat <dig> protein is a member of the stat protein family. in response to cytokines and growth factors, it forms both homo- or heterodimers with other stat proteins and the complex translocates to the nucleus, where they act as transcriptional activators. stats mediate the cell response to different stimuli, playing a key role in several cellular processes, such as cell growth and apoptosis  <cit> . as shown, using the svar method , stat <dig> regulates the expression of the cycle positive regulator cyclin d <dig> and of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl- <dig>  it has already been reported that constitutive activation of stat  <dig> correlates with cyclin d <dig> and bcl- <dig> gene overexpression, thus providing a novel prognostic marker for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  <cit> . moreover, repression of p <dig> gene expression by stat <dig> is likely to have an important role in development of tumors  <cit> . these evidence point to an involvement of stat <dig> in cell cycle progression and transformation of hela cells.

our in silico analysis also highlighted an unexpected behavior for the p <dig> gene, independently of p <dig> regulation. this alternative regulation has already been described for other cell types  <cit> , but still remains unclear in the case of hela cells. although p <dig> is not a transcription factor, it is conceivable that indirect effects of p <dig> on cellular gene expression of well-known cell cycle progression promoters, such as cyclin d <dig> and apoptosis inhibitors, such as bcl- <dig> may mediate some unexpected functions in hela cells. these functions appear to be unrelated to growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest, supporting the hypothesis that p53-independent regulation of p <dig> could be one of the signaling pathways activated during tumorogenesis and/or tumor progression in hela cells as well as in other cancer types  <cit> . future efforts directed to evaluate this hypothesis include gene transfection of p <dig> mutants lacking the p <dig> and stat3-binding sites and subsequent, analysis of the newly identified p <dig> targets gene expression and changes in hela cells phenotype and tumorigenicity.

it is interesting that, even using a small dataset, the svar method allowed identification of actual regulations, as detailed above, illustrating the power of this technique. in general, the methods reported in the literature are not based on a statistical test due to difficulties generated by the fact that the number of samples is lower than the number of parameters to be estimated, consequently, they do not provide an objective control for false-positives.

the main advantage of the sparse vector autoregressive model , compared with other connectivity models, is that it models a granger-causal network with a number of genes that is larger than the number of samples, in other words, it is useful to model "large" networks with a statistical test for each one of the edges. to the best of our knowledge, the approach taken here is the only one that combines these two advantages since other methods which model "large" networks usually do not present statistical tests for the edges. moreover, "large" gene-gene networks are commonly dealt with in pairwise comparisons. using svar, it is possible to infer partial granger-causalities resulting in a lower number of spurious edges than pairwise comparisons.

since svar deals with the multivariate case, the definition of granger causality becomes complex, because of the existence of multi-steps connectivities. in the present report, identification of granger causality using the svar model is related to the definition of partial granger-causality given by  <cit> . by definition of granger's causality  <cit>  the svar model allows analysis of cycles containing networks. therefore, there is no a priori assumption that the network must be a dag , as assumed by other methods  <cit> . as a consequence, the svar method can be used to model networks with cycles. this is of extreme importance, since it is well-known that genetic regulatory networks maintain their control and balance by a number of positive/negative feedback cycles.

there is a class of bayesian network with mcmc algorithm which may integrate expression data with multiple sources of information  <cit> . the advantages of integrating multiple sources of information, i.e., adding a priori knowledge, is speculative. integration of a priori knowledge maybe interesting to recover more realistic connections and to increase the power of the test. however, it also lead to a bias depending on the kind of information assumed in the model. in this actual stage of development of svar, integration of different information is not possible since only gene expression levels are used to estimate granger causality. further studies may be focused on integrating biological information to improve the power of svar.

the experimental comparison between svar and other methods is difficult since svar is the only one which has a statistical test for gene-gene networks comprising a notion of granger-causality. the graphical gaussian models reported by schäfer and strimmer, which apply partial correlations in the context of  is the closest one to svar, presenting a statistical test, however, the edges obtained by this approach represent instantaneous associations , failing to provide a notion of granger-causality, i.e., the edges have no direction.

differently from score functions, which pose difficult interpretations or subjective choices of the threshold to determine where there is  an edge, a statistical test is an objective way to determine whether there is an edge and what is the rate of type i error.

in this work, we considered only lags of first order, but it is relatively straightforward to generalize this method to analyze svar models with orders higher than one. however, this issue depends on the number of parameters to be estimated and the time series length.

the complexity of the proposed inference is linear to the number of genes, since only one regression is performed for each gene.

there are other approaches for variable selection based on stepwise methods. unfortunately, these methods are not consistent when n > m  <cit> , i.e., even increasing the sample size , there is no guarantee that the set of non-zero coefficients is the correct one. this result does not change even if all subsets of variables are explored.

in contrast to lasso, one may choose to use other penalized regressions, such as the more popular ridge  <cit>  or the non-negative garrote  <cit> . ridge does not set the variables to zero, resulting in models with difficult interpretations. comparing lasso to non-negative garrote, the latter is worse than lasso when multicolinearity is present in the data  <cit> . therefore, lasso seems to be the most appropriate in identifying gene regulatory networks.

another advantage of svar is the fact that it does not require model pre-specification; therefore, this method is unbiased and makes it possible to infer new connections, not just quantifying the dependence level measured by already known edges. furthermore, it is not necessary to discretize gene expression values to boolean variables, as in the boolean network models  <cit> ; therefore, there is no loss of information.

in the svar approach, to render the application of statistics when  feasible, we used the fact that the metabolic networks are sparsely connected as part of the solution. therefore, the number of variables to be analyzed decreases significantly, resulting only in variables whose estimated coefficients are large enough to be tested and rejected as being different from zero.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, here we introduce the svar method to model gene regulatory networks in the present context, where the number of samples is often lower than the number of genes. with this method, it is possible to naturally model networks with feedback loops and to infer partial granger causalities without any a priori information, which minimizes the number of spurious causalities. moreover, we present a statistical test to control for the false discovery rate, a task which was not previously possible in several other proposed gene regulatory network models.
