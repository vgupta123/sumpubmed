BACKGROUND
peripheral t and b cell proliferation represents a hallmark of immune response to an antigen. in autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis , the self-antigen is unknown. the animal model of ms, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , results from injection of small fragments of proteins associated with myelin such as myelin oligodendrocytic glycoprotein  or polylipoprotein  <cit> . mog35– <dig> immunization causes a chronic progressive form of eae in c57bl/ <dig> mice, whereas plp induces a relapse-remitting form of eae in sjl mice  <cit> . initial phases of development of both diseases are reliant on proliferation of t and b lymphocytes. the pathophysiology of both eae and ms involves proliferation of cd4+ and cd8+ t lymphocytes, followed by cd4+ t cell-mediated demyelination  <cit> . further proliferation of b cells and other t-cell subsets derived from secondary lymphoid tissues provide the basis for the inflammatory responses associated with eae/ms  <cit> .

many of the fda approved therapies for ms target cd4+ t cell signaling pathways, conversion of cd4+ t cells to t helper cells , and transition of th1- cells to th17-t cells  <cit> . however, many of the disease-modifying therapies that target t cell proliferation are not completely successful, and new immune-cell mediated treatments have utilized b cell replication, as well as redistribution of t cell subpopulations, for their approach to stabilizing disease  <cit> . in response to immunization, antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells secrete a variety of cytokines that stimulate cd4+ t cells to become differentiated into th <dig>  th <dig>  or th <dig> through a process known as polarization  <cit> . th <dig> cells are often considered pro-inflammatory, respond to il- <dig>  and produce ifn-γ, which enhances the pathway of cd4+ t cell proliferation and inflammation  <cit> . th <dig> cells are considered to be anti-inflammatory because of the specific cytokines associated with them, including il- <dig> shown to decrease disease severity. ifn-γ is known to inhibit th <dig> polarization and thus exacerbate immune-responses to eae  <cit> . preproenkephalin mrna has been detected, along with neuropeptides leucine enkephalin and methionine enkephalin  in cd4+ th <dig> and th <dig> lymphocyte subpopulations  <cit> . however, the enkephalin prohormone was not required for th <dig> differentiation. transition of th <dig> cells to the th <dig> subpopulation, or increased th <dig> subpopulations, are considered part of a “repair” mechanism and response of eae pathogenesis  <cit> .

the opioid growth factor  – ogf receptor  pathway is a regulatory pathway involved in homeostatic cell replication. the ogf-ogfr pathway has been implicated to regulate immune-activated cell proliferation in a number of diseases including ms and animal models of eae  <cit> . ogf, chemically termed -enkephalin, is an inhibitory growth factor that binds to ogfr in a selective manner to upregulate cyclin-dependent inhibitory kinases and thus suppress replication. low doses of naltrexone  work by biofeedback mechanisms to stimulate endogenous peptide and receptor release, thus providing enhanced inhibitory action. ogf and ldn therapies have been examined in both chronic progressive and relapse-remitting models of mouse eae  <cit> . systemic injections of ogf or ldn initiated at the time of disease induction by mog35– <dig> demonstrated markedly less severe clinical signs of disease and reduced spinal cord neuropathology in c57bl/6 j mice  <cit> . ogf treatment initiated at the time of established progressive disease reversed the course of eae within 6 days  <cit> . evaluation of spinal cord tissues demonstrated reduced numbers of activated astrocytes, microglia/macrophages, and damaged neurons, as well as decreased demyelination  <cit> . ogf and ldn therapy of established relapse-remitting eae whereby plp139– <dig> is injected into sjl/j mice and after  <dig> consecutive days of clinical signs of disease, mice are injected with ogf or ldn, revealed diminished peak disease scores for both treatments, and a significant number of mice experiencing partial, if not complete, remissions  <cit> . these data support the role of endogenous opioid suppression of eae progression.

previous work has shown that t and b lymphocytes isolated from normal mice, and stimulated in culture to divide, had significantly reduced proliferation following administration of ogf or ldn  <cit> . ogf inhibited lymphocyte cell replication in a dose-dependent, reversible and receptor mediated manner. reduction of ogfr by sirna technology prevented ogf’s inhibitory action. moreover, no other exogenous and endogenous opioid peptides had an effect on inhibiting t or b cell replication in culture  <cit> . these in vitro data, along with the behavioral consequences of ogf or ldn on eae mice, support the role of the ogf-ogfr axis as an important regulation pathway in early phases of eae.

in adaptive immune diseases such as eae, t cell expansion occurs in a dynamic manner which influences expression of clinical disease and response to immunotherapy  <cit> . the present experiments investigate how ogf or ldn alter early phases of immune response in eae, and study whether endogenous opioids such as ogf selectively inhibit the proliferation of one or more subpopulations of t lymphocytes. these studies provide an improved understanding of mechanistic pathways involved in repression of ms by ldn or ogf therapy.

mice immunized with mog35– <dig> were observed daily and behavior scored by an observer masked to the identity of the mouse. clinical disease appeared on day  <dig> or  <dig> for all mice . by day  <dig>  mice receiving ogf or ldn beginning at the time of disease induction had significantly reduced behavioral scores, with an average of  <dig>  or less for both groups in comparison to saline-treated mice with mean scores of  <dig>  and  <dig> on days  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. by day  <dig>  saline-treated eae mice had behavioral scores of  <dig> indicating some paralysis, whereas mice in the ogf group had a mean disease score of  <dig> . the reductions in overall disease scores were less that those reported for larger groups of mice  <cit> .figure  <dig> behavior of mice immunized with myelin oligodendrocytic protein  to induce eae and treated with ogf or ldn. behavioral scores of mice immunized with mog33– <dig> and treated daily with either 10 mg/kg ogf  or  <dig>  mg/kg naltrexone ; control mice received intraperitoneal injections of  <dig>  ml saline . mice were evaluated daily and scored  by multiple observers, with one masked to treatment. values represent means ± sem; n =  <dig> or  <dig> mice/group. significantly different from saline-injected mice at p <  <dig>  .



total lymphocyte number in non-immunized, normal mice
the average numbers of lymphocytes isolated from the spleens of control, non-immunized c57bl/ <dig> mice on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were  <dig>  x  <dig>   <dig>  x  <dig> and  <dig>  x  <dig>  respectively. on day  <dig>  the average number of lymphocytes recorded in the inguinal lymph nodes of normal, non-challenged mice was  <dig>  x  <dig> . on days  <dig> and  <dig>  the average number of lymphocytes in normal inguinal nodes ranged between  <dig>  x  <dig> and  <dig>  x  <dig> 

total lymphocyte number in spleens of mog-immunized mice
splenic lymphocytes were isolated from non-immunized and mog-immunized mice  on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and total cell number was recorded by a hemacytometer . five days following immunization, normal c57bl/ <dig> mice had approximately  <dig> million lymphocytes in the spleen in comparison to an average of  <dig> million lymphocytes in mog-eae mice . by day  <dig>  mog-immunized mice had enlarged spleens with  <dig> million lymphocytes in comparison to  <dig> million in non-immunized mice . on day  <dig>  lymphocyte number increased to  <dig> million in the immunized mice and  <dig> million in the non-challenged animals.figure  <dig> effects of ogf or ldn on splenic lymphocytes from eae mice. lymphocytes isolated from spleens of c57bl/ <dig> mice immunized with mog35– <dig> and injected daily with 10 mg/kg ogf ,  <dig>  mg/kg naltrexone  or  <dig>  ml saline ; normal mice received saline at each injection point. splenocytes from 3– <dig> mice per treatment at  <dig> and 8 days were isolated, labeled, and sorted by flow cytometry. values represent means ± sem. significantly different from normal mice at p <  <dig>   or p <  <dig>  , and from saline-treated immunized mice at p <  <dig>   or p <  <dig>  .



mog-immunized mice received ogf or ldn beginning at the time of immunization and continued daily for 15 days . within 5 days of treatment, both ogf- and ldn-treatment reduced the total number of lymphocytes in comparison to mog-immunized mice; mog + ogf mice had  <dig> million cells, and mog + ldn animals had  <dig> million splenocytes, in comparison to approximately  <dig> million cells in mog + saline mice. on day  <dig>  total lymphocyte number was decreased approximately 34% for both groups of mog-immunized mice receiving either ogf or ldn; treated mice had approximately  <dig> million splenocytes in comparison to  <dig> million counted in mog + saline animals. on day  <dig>  all groups of immunized mice had between  <dig> and  <dig> million total lymphocytes in the spleen.

subpopulations of splenic lymphocytes in ogf- and ldn-treated mog-immunized mice
flow cytometric analyses of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, as well as b lymphocytes in the spleens of immunized mice revealed that ogf and ldn reduced immune-stimulated t cell proliferation at  <dig> and 12 days following mog immunization . b cell number was inhibited by ogf and ldn on day  <dig> 

within 5 days of treatment with exogenous ogf or ldn, cd8+ t lymphocyte subpopulations in mog + ogf and mog + ldn mice were reduced by 29% to 32% from that recorded for mog immunized saline-treated mice . cd4+ t cells in mog + ogf or mog + ldn groups were reduced by approximately 30% from that of mog + saline mice. b cell number was comparable for all groups of immunized mice and non-stimulated animals.

after 12 days of treatment, mog-immunized mice receiving saline had approximately  <dig> million cd4+ splenic t lymphocytes, a 41% increase over non-immunized animals . animals receiving ogf or ldn had 32-37% reductions in the number of cd4+ t cells relative to the number recorded for mog + saline mice. the subpopulation of cd8+ t cells in the spleens of mog + ogf and mog + ldn mice were reduced 35-42% relative to mog + saline mice, as well as reduced relative to normal mice. b cell number was elevated to  <dig> million, a 2-fold increase in comparison to the  <dig> million b-cells recorded in non-immunized normal mice. ogf and ldn treatment markedly reduced the number of cd <dig> stained b220+ b cells by approximately 29% from the saline-injected mog mice.

on day  <dig> following immunization and treatment, ogf or ldn treatment had no effect on subpopulations of t cells isolated from the spleen; cd4+ and cd8+ t cell number ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> million for all treatment groups, including normal mice. b cell number in the spleen was elevated to  <dig> million in immunized mice from  <dig> million recorded for normal animals. ogf and ldn treated groups had approximately  <dig> million b cells in the spleen.

right inguinal lymph node lymphocyte proliferation
mice were initially inoculated with mog35– <dig> on the right side rendering the right inguinal node as a “draining node” on day  <dig>  in comparison to  <dig>  lymphocytes in a normal lymph node, stimulated mice had  <dig>  million within 5 days of immunization . the total number of lymphocytes in the right, draining inguinal node of mog immunized mice reached  <dig> million on day  <dig> in comparison to  <dig>  million in normal mice. ogf-treated mice had total lymphocyte counts ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million, whereas ldn-treated mog-immunized mice had total cell numbers in the right inguinal node of  <dig>  to  <dig>  million . ogf and ldn treatment did not reduce the overall cell number in the right inguinal node.figure  <dig> inhibition of proliferation of t lymphocyte subpopulations in right inguinal nodes in eae mice following ogf or ldn treatment. total lymphocytes isolated from right inguinal nodes of mice immunized with mog35– <dig> and injected daily with 10 mg/kg ogf ,  <dig>  mg/kg naltrexone , or  <dig>  ml saline ; normal mice received saline at each injection point. right nodes were activated following injections on day 0; lymphocytes from 3– <dig> mice per treatment at  <dig> and 12 days were isolated, labeled, and sorted by flow cytometry. values represent means ± sem. significantly different from normal mice at p <  <dig>  , p <  <dig>  , and p <  <dig>  , and from saline-treated immunized mice at p <  <dig>  .



analyses of t and b cell subpopulations using flow cytometry demonstrated that mog-immunization increased cd4+ and cd8+ t cell number by 5- to 6-fold over normal mice, while b220+ cells detected by cd <dig> antibody were increased 15-fold in the right inguinal node within 5 days of injection of mog . ogf and ldn treatment reduced cd4+ t cell number in the right inguinal node of mog mice by  <dig> and 41%, respectively, on day  <dig>  although cd8+ and cd45+ specific t and b cells, respectively, were reduced by ogf and ldn, values were not significantly different.

after 12 days of immunization, and 7 days after direct injection near the right inguinal node, the right inguinal node of mog + saline mice had  <dig> -fold more cd4+ t cells than recorded in nodes of non-stimulated animals. ogf or ldn treatment did not alter cd4+ subpopulations of lymph nodes cells. however, ogf reduced cd8+ t cells in the right lymph node by 43%, and ldn reduced cell number by 10%, in comparison to values reported for mog + saline mice. the subpopulation of b220+ b cells, as detected by cd <dig> antibodies, was increased 9- to 14- fold in the immunized groups relative to non-stimulated mice. although ogf reduced b cell subpopulations in the right lymph node by 33%, values did not differ significantly from the mog + saline group; ldn treatment did not alter cd8+ t cell or b cell subpopulations.

approximately 2 weeks after immunization , the total number of lymphocytes in the right inguinal node of immunized mice was approximately 5-fold that of non-stimulated animals, and comparable among all groups of mog35– <dig> inoculated mice. subpopulations of t cells were elevated approximately 5-fold and 6-fold respectively for cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, and more than 17-fold for cd <dig> positive b cells. ogf and ldn did not alter the subpopulation distribution in the right inguinal node at this time.

left inguinal lymph node lymphocyte proliferation
the second inoculation of mog35– <dig> was on the left side on day  <dig> which stimulated the left inguinal node to become activated by day  <dig>  thus, on day  <dig>  the total number of lymphocytes in the left inguinal node was comparable between all treatment groups, and ranged between  <dig>  to  <dig>  million cells . subpopulations of t and b lymphocytes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cells. nonetheless, ogf treatment inhibited cell replication of the cd4+ t cells by 64%; with only  <dig>  cells recorded from mog + ogf mice in comparison to  <dig>  cells in the mog + saline animals. ldn reduced cd4+ t cells by 69% in comparison to mog + saline cell numbers. although cd8+ t cells were reduced more than 50% by both ogf and ldn, values were not significantly different. cd <dig> stained b220+ b cell number ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  cells on day  <dig> figure  <dig> inhibition of proliferation of t lymphocyte subpopulations in left inguinal nodes in eae mice following ogf or ldn treatment. total lymphocytes isolated from the left inguinal nodes of mice immunized with mog35– <dig> and injected daily with 10 mg/kg ogf ,  <dig>  mg/kg naltrexone , or  <dig>  ml saline ; normal mice received saline at each injection point. the left inguinal node was considered “draining” on day  <dig>  5 days following injection on the left flank. lymphocytes from 3– <dig> mice per treatment at  <dig> and 12 days were isolated, labeled, and sorted by flow cytometry. values represent means ± sem. significantly different from normal mice at p <  <dig>  , p <  <dig>  , and p <  <dig>  , and from saline-treated immunized mice at p <  <dig>  .



on day  <dig>  cell number in the left inguinal node increased in the immunized mice to  <dig>  –  <dig>  million total lymphocytes . although immunization significantly increased the number of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, as well as cd45+ b cells, the number of lymphocytes in the left inguinal node was not inhibited by ogf or ldn.

by day  <dig>  total left inguinal node cell number increased to greater than  <dig> million, in comparison to  <dig>  million cells in the non-immunized mouse. subpopulations of cd4+ t cells increased to  <dig> million in mog-stimulated mice relative to less than  <dig>  in the left inguinal node of normal mice. similar profiles for expansion of cd8+ t cells were noted in the mog-immunized mice; ldn and ogf had no effect on cell proliferation at 15 days.

intracellular distribution of cns derived lymphocytes
cns derived lymphocytes isolated from the lumbar spinal cord of mog-immunized mice treated for 15 days with ogf, ldn, or saline were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining. cell homogenates were labeled with markers for cd4+ t cells, as well as for cytokines that were expressed on th <dig>  th <dig>  and th <dig> subsets of t cells . from six spinal cords per group,  <dig> x <dig>   <dig> x <dig>  and  <dig> x <dig> lymphocytes were collected from the saline, ogf, and ldn treated groups respectively. lymphocyte subpopulations were counted and revealed that the number of cd4+ cells for saline, ogf, and ldn groups were  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig>  cells respectively. ifn-  cells totaled  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig>  cells respectively for saline, ogf, and ldn treated mice. th <dig>  cells numbered  <dig> for ldn treated mice and negligible/none for saline and ogf treated mice. the largest number of th <dig> cells were recorded in ogf mice  in comparison to  <dig>  for saline-treated mice, and  <dig>  for ldn treated animals. of the lymphocytes analyzed by flow cytometry, ogf treatment resulted in a  <dig> -fold increase in the percentage of total lymphocytes that were cd4+ t cells relative to the number recorded for saline-treated mog-immunized mice . ogf treatment resulted in an increase in the ratio of double- stained cd4+/ifn-γ  and cd4+/il- <dig>  cells in comparison to the number of cells gated in the mog + saline group. ogf exposure increased the percentage of th <dig> and th <dig> cell subpopulations by  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively, as compared to the saline group . ldn treatment did not alter the ratio of cd4+ t cells or the number of th <dig>  th <dig>  and th <dig> subsets. th <dig> cells, often considered as “anti-inflammatory”, were not detected.figure  <dig> differential t cell subpopulations in spinal cord of eae mice treated with ogf or ldn. differential cell counts of lymphocytes isolated from spinal cords isolated from mice immunized with mog35– <dig> and treated from the time of induction with 10 mg/kg ogf ,  <dig>  mg/kg naltrexone , or  <dig>  ml saline ; normal mice received saline at each injection point. representative facs profiles of t-cell populations obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. lymphocytes were isolated from spinal cord and stained with markers for cd4+, th <dig>  th <dig>  and th17t cells.  parameters for representative flow cytometry dot plots.  representative flow cytometry dot plots for ogf, ldn, and saline treated mice 15 days after immunization with mog35– <dig>   histograms represent the percentage  of electronically gated cells obtained from flow cytometry; samples were run in triplicate. little or no th <dig> cells were detected. significantly different from saline-treated mice at p >  <dig>  .



discussion
enkephalins have always been considered to have immunomodulatory properties  <cit> . the role of t and b cell proliferation in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is of great interest, and many papers have shown a biphasic proliferative role in cells, with t cell proliferation increased early in the process of immunization, and then reduced several weeks following antigen stimulation  <cit> .

the present study is the first to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of the endogenous opioid ogf on cell proliferation, and particularly on inhibition of t cell proliferation in vivo. previous work in our laboratory revealed that in vitro stimulation of t cells by phytohemagglutinin and incubation with ogf diminished cell replication. splenic cells isolated from normal mice and treated with 10 μg phytohemagglutin per ml of media were stimulated to proliferate; treatment with ogf reduced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. the repressive effects of ogf on proliferation were mediated through ogfr, as reduction of ogfr protein by sirna technology removed the inhibitory effect of ogf  <cit> . the present experiments expand on our in vitro data  <cit>  that demonstrated the presence of both ogf and ogfr in lymphocytes, and demonstrate that in vivo manipulation of the ogf-ogfr axis alters proliferation of different subpopulations of t and b lymphocytes in peripheral lymph tissue and spinal cord. our tissue culture studies on t and b cell proliferation reveal that the mechanism of ogf’s inhibitory activity on cell number is by reducing dna synthesis, and not by enhancing apoptosis or necrosis  <cit> . incorporation of tritiated thymidine into the splenocytes in cultures also demonstrated the inhibitory effect of ogf. treatment of stimulated t and b cells with other opioid agonists such as leucine enkephalin, endomorphin  <dig>  β-endorphin, dynorphin 1– <dig>  or morphine had no effect on immune cell-specific proliferation. in fact, β-endorphin may enhance cell proliferation of immune cells through non-opioid receptor mechanisms  <cit> .

reports on whether opioid peptides alter t and b cell proliferation are often conflicting  <cit> . differences in the studies as to whether opioids inhibit or enhance immune-cell replication in vitro depend of a number of experimental factors including variations in dosage, class of peptide , whether cells are stimulated or not, and length of treatment. ogf did not affect proliferation in unstimulated cells in culture, or splenic cells in vivo.

most studies on t and b cell proliferation in mice with an autoimmune disease are focused on conversion of treg to teff cell types, or changes between th <dig> and th <dig> or th <dig>  <cit> . in the present studies, mice challenged with mog35– <dig> peptide displayed clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by day  <dig> or  <dig>  clinical signs of behavioral deficits were evident on days  <dig> and  <dig> in the ldn group and on days 11– <dig> for the ogf-treated group. the behavioral scores in this experiment were limited to a small number of mice in comparison to other studies where mean disease scores were  <dig> to 75% reduced in animals treated with ogf or ldn relative to saline-treated eae mice  <cit> . the minimal effects of ldn on behavior most probably extend to t cell proliferation as well, suggesting that a more robust effect is possible and that animal variation is always evident in behavioral studies.

day  <dig> appeared to be the peak day of proliferation of splenic lymphocytes, whereas cell replication in inguinal lymph nodes peaked on day  <dig>  ogf and ldn inhibited cd4+ and cd8+ t cell subpopulations, as well as cd <dig> stained b cells relative to values from saline-treated mog-immunized mice on day  <dig>  the greatest effects of ogf and ldn treatment on inhibiting the proliferation of t and b cell subpopulations in lymph nodes occurred on day  <dig>  total lymphocyte numbers were inhibited by as much as 40% following only  <dig> injections of ogf in comparison to total immune cell numbers in mog immunized mice. direct injections of ogf, rather than endogenous ogf stimulated by ldn, were more effective at repressing b and t lymphocyte replication. ldn had minimal effect inhibiting b cells in this model of eae. with regards to cns derived lymphocytes, ogf stimulated th <dig> cell proliferation suggesting that cell-mediate immunity and interferon-γ and interleukin - <dig> are upregulated. the lack of th <dig> cells being detected in the spinal cord may reflect the course of disease and the early period of sample collection  as th <dig> cells tend to proliferate to inhibit phagocytic-dependent inflammation. the presence of th <dig>  but not th <dig> cells, does not necessarily indicate that there are no anti-inflammatory cells responding to the antigen presentation  <cit> . th <dig> effector cells, along with th <dig> cells, are polarized to cause inflammation. mice lacking either th <dig> or th <dig> were not immunoprotected suggesting that neither subset alone is responsible for disease progression. the increased proliferation of th <dig> cells might simply reflect the early stage of disease and the peak flair; the lack of effect by ogf might indicate that treatment with endogenous opioids shifts the timetable of disease earlier so that th <dig> cells are degrading intracellular pathogens earlier in the process, moving forward with anti-inflammatory response. additional studies would be required for a complete investigation of th <dig> to th <dig> transition.

CONCLUSIONS
the ogf-ogfr pathway regulates proliferation of peripheral immune cells following stimulation by mog35– <dig> antigen. exogenous ogf or endogenous ogf following ldn treatment inhibited cd4+ and cd8+ t and b cell replication within the spleen and draining inguinal nodes within the first week of immune-related response, and in spinal cord tissue on day  <dig> following antigen stimulation. these data support that modulation of the ogf-ogfr pathway is an effective therapeutic paradigm for ms.
