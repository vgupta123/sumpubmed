BACKGROUND
chromosomal inversions are a common feature of genome evolution in many groups of animals and may play a significant role in adaptation, speciation and sex chromosome evolution  <cit> . the rate of rearrangement fixation varies significantly within and between animal groups  <cit> . the genus drosophila shows one of the highest rates in all eukaryotes  <cit>  at least partially because special cytological mechanisms in diptera allow heterozygotes for paracentric inversions to circumvent the production of aneuploid gametes  <cit> . a striking extent of variation in rearrangement rate has been reported among different drosophila lineages  <cit> . for instance, the fixation rate of inversions is higher in the sophophora subgenus than in the drosophila subgenus  <cit> . also particular lineages such as d. miranda or d. yakuba exhibit an unusually rapid rate of chromosomal evolution  <cit> . four factors may contribute to the variation among lineages in the rate of chromosomal rearrangement: generation time, population size, mutation rate and fitness effects of rearrangements. however, the actual reason for such variation is unclear and different studies invoke different explanations  <cit> .

chromosomal inversions can be generated by two major mechanisms. the first of them is ectopic recombination  between transposable elements   <cit> , segmental duplications  <cit>  or short repeat sequences  <cit> . when ectopic recombination occurs between two copies of a te inserted in opposite orientation at two different chromosomal sites, the resulting inverted chromosomal segment will be flanked by two chimeric te copies bounded by exchanged target site duplications   <cit> . the second mechanism is chromosomal breakage and erroneous repair of the free ends by non-homologous end-joining   <cit> . breakages can be simple double-strand breaks  or staggered single-strand breaks . in the second case, the consequence is the generation of inverted duplications at both sides of the inverted segment  <cit> . thus, inversions generated in this way can be recognized by duplicated dna segments  in inverted orientation flanking the inverted chromosomal segment. the relative contribution of the two mechanisms to the generation of natural drosophila inversions is not yet clear. in dipterans, clear-cut evidence for the implication of tes in their generation has been found for a few polymorphic inversions  <cit>  but has never been found for fixed inversions  <cit> . on the other hand, breakage and repair by nhej may be the prevalent mechanism in d. melanogaster and its close relatives  <cit> .

several explanations have been put forward for the spread of inversions in populations  <cit> . although in principle inversions could be neutral or underdominant and spread by genetic drift, this is probably unusual in drosophila species given their elevated effective population size, of the order of  <dig>  <cit> . the traditional explanation for the adaptive significance of inversions is based on their recombination-reducing effect  <cit>  that keeps together alleles at loci with epistatic effects on fitness, the "coadaptation" hypothesis  <cit> . an alternative model proposes that inversions capture a set of locally adapted genes and protect them from recombination with immigrant chromosomes  <cit> . finally, inversions may spread in populations due to the direct mutational effects associated with their breakpoints, the "position effect" hypothesis  <cit> . this latter hypothesis has received so far little attention  <cit>  but the relatively high gene density and compact structure of drosophila genome   <cit>  make position effects most likely. available genomic sequences  <cit>  provide the opportunity to investigate the structure of inversion breakpoints and ascertain their functional consequences.

drosophila mojavensis has been an excellent model for the study of the genetics of ecological adaptation and speciation for more than fifty years  <cit>  and it is now a useful model for genomic studies as the complete genome sequence is available  <cit> . d. mojavensis is a cactophilic species in the repleta group endemic to the deserts of the southwestern usa and northwestern mexico, chiefly the sonoran desert  the mojave desert and santa catalina island in southern california. natural populations are genetically differentiated and use different primary host plants, stenocereus gummosus  in baja california, stenocereus thurberi  in arizona and sonora, ferocactus cylindraceous  in southern california and opuntia spp. on santa catalina island  <cit> . the ecological conditions of the sonoran desert are extreme  as attested by the fact that only four drosophila species are endemic  <cit> . accordingly, d. mojavensis is unusually thermotolerant and desiccation resistant  <cit> . in addition, d. mojavensis is the exclusive inhabitant of its chief host plants over most of its distribution range, in part because they contain large amounts of unusual lipids and triterpene glycosides that make them unsuitable for other drosophila species  <cit> .

the salivary gland chromosomes of d. mojavensis and its close relatives d. arizonae and d. navojoa were cytologically analyzed and the d. mojavensis standard chromosomal arrangement seemingly contain ten fixed inversions compared to primitive i , one in chromosome x , seven in chromosome  <dig>  and two on chromosome  <dig>   <cit> . five inversions  are exclusive to d. mojavensis whereas the rest are shared by other cactophilic drosophila of the mulleri complex . thus, d. mojavensis is a chromosomally derived species that contains the highest number of fixed inversions in the entire mulleri complex  <cit> . only one of d. mojavensis inversions  has been previously characterized at the molecular level  <cit> . here we characterize all inversions fixed in d. mojavensis chromosome  <dig>  the most dynamic of the five major chromosomes, and explore the causes of its rapid chromosomal evolution. using comparative mapping of bac-end sequences from d. buzzatii onto the d. mojavensis genome , we identify the breakpoint regions of all inversions. we then annotate them by comparison with the genome of d. virilis, the closest relative with a sequenced genome  <cit>  that represents the ancestral  arrangement. our results provide information on the multiple causes that generated these inversions, reveal unreported associations of inversion breakpoints with duplicated and transposed genes, and shed light on the functional consequences of d. mojavensis inversions. overall, our results suggest that rapid chromosomal evolution in d. mojavensis is not due to an increase in the rate of inversion generation but to its adaptation to the extremely harsh environment of the sonoran desert that was accompanied by strong natural selection.

RESULTS
identification of syntenic segments and breakpoint regions
we sequenced the ends of  <dig>  d. buzzatii chromosome  <dig> bac clones  <cit>  and  <dig>  bac-end sequences  mapped onto d. mojavensis chromosome  <dig> . by comparing the chromosomal localization of the markers, we identified  <dig> syntenic segments . d. mojavensis scaffold  <dig>  corresponding to chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , is  <dig> , <dig> bp long . the most proximal marker in our map  was located at position  <dig> , <dig> bp whereas the most distal marker  was located at position  <dig> , <dig>  i.e. only  <dig> kb from the end of the scaffold. the largest segment was number  <dig> with  <dig> . <dig> kb and  <dig> markers whereas the smallest one was number  <dig> with  <dig>  kb and  <dig> markers. the second-smallest segment was number  <dig> with  <dig>  kb and  <dig> markers. this latter segment was exceptional as it was detected using comparative information from bac clone 1b <dig> that has been fully sequenced  <cit> . in general, the markers were distributed homogeneously along the chromosome as indicated by the highly significant correlation  between segment size and number of markers. the  <dig> syntenic segments amount to  <dig> , <dig> bp, representing ~ <dig> % coverage of chromosome  <dig>  the missing  <dig> , <dig> bp are distributed between the endmost chromosomal regions  and the  <dig> breakpoint regions .

estimating the genomic distance
the order, size and orientation of the  <dig> conserved syntenic segments are shown in figure  <dig>  this breakpoint graph  <cit>  contains nine cycles , namely eight rectangles and a more complex cycle comprising two concatenated rectangles, suggesting that eight inversions and a more complex rearrangement are fixed in chromosome  <dig> since the divergence between d. buzzatii and d. mojavensis. grimm software  <cit>  indicated that a minimum of  <dig> inversions are needed to transform the d. buzzatii chromosome  <dig> into that of d. mojavensis . because there are  <dig> syntenic segments and  <dig> breakpoints, this implies one breakpoint reuse. previous work in our laboratory  <cit>  determined that three inversions, 2m, 2n and 2z <dig>  have been fixed in chromosome  <dig> of d. buzzatii since its divergence from primitive i, the most recent common ancestor with d. mojavensis . furthermore, the breakpoints of these three inversions have been isolated and sequenced  <cit> . inversions 2m and 2n are arranged in tandem and share the middle breakpoint. thus we identified the complex cycle in the breakpoint graph  as corresponding to the 2mn rearrangement and determined that seven inversions have been fixed in d. mojavensis since divergence from primitive i. these seven inversions entail  <dig> breakpoints, i.e. they have independent breakpoints. grimm software  <cit>  was run again to compare the arrangement of d. mojavensis chromosome  <dig> with that of primitive i . the result was the single scenario shown in figure  <dig> 

in order to compare the inversions proposed by grimm with those detected previously using cytological methods , we located on the d. buzzatii physical map  <cit>  those clones that mapped on each d. mojavensis breakpoint region and identified the chromosomal bands involved in each case. we corroborated the inversion breakpoints identified by cytogenetics and those detected by bioinformatics with an accuracy of three to five bands. rearrangements detected cytologically and those proposed by grimm  did not only match in number but also the regions involved in each of them were in agreement, allowing for the differences between the precision of both techniques. however, three cytological breakpoint coincidences were not corroborated at the sequence level. the general agreement between cytogenetics and bioinformatics is remarkable because often these two approaches to chromosomal evolution seem to provide discordant results  <cit> . for instance, in drosophila, comparative mapping has sometimes revealed fixed inversions overlooked by previous cytological studies  <cit> .

delimitation and annotation of breakpoint regions
among the seven chromosome  <dig> inversions fixed in the d. mojavensis lineage, three  are shared between diverse species of the mulleri complex and must be between  <dig> and  <dig> myr old ; another one  is shared between d. mojavensis and d. arizonae only and should be between  <dig> and  <dig> myr old ; the remaining three inversions  are exclusive of d. mojavensis and thus must be relatively young . we initially identified the  <dig> breakpoint regions of these seven inversions as those sequences between syntenic segments . these regions varied between  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp. in order to narrow down the size of these regions, the corresponding sequences were blasted against the d. virilis genome , which represents the parental  chromosome . we expect that breakpoint regions for each inversion will appear in d. mojavensis genome as ac  and bd  but in d. virilis genome as ab  and cd . similarity comparisons of ac, bd, ab and cd sequences allowed us to reduce the size of the breakpoint regions to between  <dig> bp and  <dig>  bp, on average  <dig> % of the original breakpoint regions . five breakpoint regions were further reduced to about  <dig> % of their previous size  by excluding the coding sequences of orthologous genes. once the new limits for the  <dig> breakpoint regions in d. mojavensis were established, we analyzed the similarity between the two breakpoint regions of each inversion using blast  <dig> sequences  <cit> . a summary list of the genes adjacent to the  <dig> inversion breakpoints is shown in table  <dig> and a detailed annotation of the breakpoint regions of each inversion is shown in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for the most recent inversions  and additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for the rest. te content of all the breakpoint sequences  is summarized in additional file  <dig>  our analysis of the breakpoints provides significant information on the causes and consequences of the seven chromosome  <dig> inversions fixed in d. mojavensis  that we present in the following sections.

generation of chromosomal inversions
in order to test for the implication of tes in the generation of the seven inversions, we analyzed the te content of the breakpoint regions and detected copies of a te at both co-occurrent breakpoints in three inversions: 2s, 2r and 2c . one of them, inversion 2s, provides compelling evidence for the implication of the transposon but <dig>  <cit>  in its generation. at the distal breakpoint, a 981-bp copy of but <dig> was found bounded by the 9-bp sequences aaggcaagt and ctgtataat . at the proximal breakpoint, we uncovered a 27-bp but <dig> fragment comprising  <dig> bp identical to one end and  <dig> bp identical to the other end, and thus resembling the footprints that transposons often leave behind at the donor site following excision  <cit>  bounded by the 9-bp sequences acttgcctt and attatacag. these sequences can be interpreted as tsd produced at the time of the transposon insertion and its exchanged arrangement  provides unequivocal evidence for the generation of inversion 2s by ectopic recombination between but <dig> copies. recently work in our laboratory has shown that an inversion fixed in d. uniseta, another related species that belongs to the buzzatii complex  <cit> , has also been generated by ectopic recombination between but <dig> copies.

two of our inversions provide evidence for generation by chromosomal breakage and erroneous repair by nhej  <cit>  . in the breakpoints of inversion 2h we found evidence for a duplication of a  <dig> -kb long segment containing three genes, cg <dig>  dmoj\gi <dig> and pasha . when the two d. mojavensis breakpoint regions ac and bd were compared, we uncovered  <dig> blocks of similarity   <dig> to 641-bp long. these blocks are scattered in a  <dig> -bp segment containing genes cg <dig>  dmoj\gi <dig> and pasha in the ac breakpoint, and within a  <dig> -bp segment including dmoj\gi <dig> in the bd breakpoint . this duplication can be explained by staggered ssb at the distal breakpoint in the parental chromosome. in the distal breakpoint of the derived chromosome  the segment seems intact and the three genes fully functional whereas in the proximal breakpoint , this segment has been reduced to  <dig>  kb by several deletions . because the duplication was caused by the inversion, we estimated the age of the 2h inversion using the divergence of those fragments non-coding for proteins and the drosophila neutral substitution rate of  <dig>   <cit>  as  <dig>  myr, which is in agreement with the phylogenetic distribution of inversion 2h . in the breakpoints of inversion 2q there are also inverted duplications. in this case, staggered ssb likely occurred at both breakpoints involving a ~1-kb segment at distal breakpoint  and a  <dig> -kb segment at proximal breakpoint  . we estimated the age of inversion 2q using the same procedure as before as  <dig>  myr, a figure fully compatible with the phylogeny . there is a third case, where duplicated genes  in opposite orientation are found at the two inversion 2c breakpoints . however, this observation is best interpreted as a breakage occurring at a preexisting duplication .

preexisting gene duplications at breakpoints
we found four cases where inversion breakpoints fall between duplicated genes, i.e. there were preexisting gene duplications at the breakpoint regions . in order to determine if this is in concordance with the random expectation, we estimated the number of intergenic regions localized between duplicated genes in d. mojavensis chromosome  <dig>  genes in this chromosome encode  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  d. mojavensis predicted proteins . thus there are  <dig>  putative intergenic regions in this chromosome. according to the previous established criteria to consider two genes as duplicated copies , we detected  <dig> intergenic regions between duplicated genes along the entire chromosome. we compared the two proportions by three different statistical methods. the χ <dig> test with and without yates correction  indicated that 4/ <dig> is significantly higher than the proportion expected at random . fisher exact test  corroborated this result. it could be argued that breakpoints are distributed at random in non-coding intergenic regions and that duplicated genes accumulate more breakpoints because their mean intergenic distance is longer than that between non-duplicated genes. we tested this possibility by calculating the intergenic distance for both duplicated and non-duplicated genes in d. mojavensis chromosome  <dig>  a t-test showed that means are significantly different , but the mean distance between duplicated genes is actually the shortest one. thus, we conclude that there is an excess of breakpoints localized between duplicated genes with respect to the random expectation. previously, another d. mojavensis inversion  was found to have a breakpoint adjacent to a gene duplication  <cit>  and in primates, rearrangement breakpoints have been sometimes observed in the midst or adjacent to clustered gene families  <cit> .

two explanations can be put forward for these observations. firstly, duplicated genes might cause instability and increased rate of dbs  <cit>  or might be breakage "permissive" regions  <cit> . alternatively, we suggest that the mobilization of a duplicated gene may entail in some cases beneficial position effects that might help the inversion to be fixed within the species. two duplicated genes may have their evolution constrained because of shared regulatory sequences, their co-location in the same chromatin regulatory domain, or sequence homogenization by frequent conversion and ectopic recombination events. the re-location of one of the copies to a different chromosomal region might produce beneficial changes in the regulation of expression for one or the two copies and/or release them from evolutionary constraints .

association of inversion breakpoints with gene transposition events
gene content of chromosomal elements is generally conserved in the genus drosophila although gene order has been scrambled extensively by fixed paracentric inversions  <cit> . however, there have been a number of genes that have been relocated between or within chromosomal elements by gene transposition or retroposition  <cit> . we searched the  <dig> genes adjacent to d. mojavensis inversion breakpoints in the  <dig> drosophila genomes  <cit>  for evidences of gene transposition and found that there are three genes involved in interchromosomal transposition events  and another one  is likely involved in a intrachromosomal transposition . furthermore, two genes are present in the d. virilis breakpoints regions but not in d. mojavensis and thus are likely also transposed genes. finally, a large dna block including several clusters of histone genes have been inserted in the proximal breakpoint of inversion 2r .

in order to test for an association of inversion breakpoints and gene transpositions, we first determined that  <dig> out of  <dig> interchromosomally relocated genes  <cit>  are located in d. mojavensis chromosome  <dig>  then we compared our proportion of interchromosomal gene transpositions  to the general chromosome  <dig> proportion . the χ <dig> test with and without yates correction , and the fisher exact test  indicated that 3/ <dig> is significantly higher than the relation expected at random. this test is conservative as we did not take into account the putative intrachromosomal transposition of dmoj\gi <dig>  the two d. virilis lineage specific genes or the 90-kb insertion at 2r proximal breakpoint . the association of inversion breakpoints and transposed genes is likely the result of the "fragility" or "permissivity" of these regions  <cit> . a clear example is the 2g distal breakpoint region in d. virilis where three genes  have transposed to this region from different sources.

the 2r proximal breakpoint  harbors a big block of dna  not found in any of the d. virilis breakpoints. this block contains at least five tandemly arranged copies of the histone gene cluster  <cit> . the exact number of copies cannot be determined due to the presence of a ~ <dig> kb sequence gap bounded by histone genes from different clusters. the block also comprises a large number of fragments annotated as repetitive sequences . these elements tend to occur at regular intervals with a periodicity similar to that of the histone gene clusters. in d. melanogaster the histone complex  is located in chromosomal arm 2l  and comprises ~ <dig> tandemly arranged copies of a cluster containing five histone genes   <cit> . histone genes are often involved in transposition events. in the repleta group species, the ancestral and chief his-c  is likely located at chromosome  <dig>  but there are other derived and probably smaller complexes  at chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  implying at least two transposition events  <cit> . the insertion of a ~90-kb block containing several histone gene clusters in the 2r proximal breakpoint  seems to represent yet another transposition event, which is probably specific to d. mojavensis. this block is not found in d. virilis in any of the two breakpoints and was not found in d. mulleri or d. buzzatii by in situ hybridization  <cit> . we suggest that the occurrence of this ~90-kb block is the result of the reintegration of an extrachromosomal circular dna fragment  replicated by rolling circle replication  <cit>  perhaps at the time of the inversion generation . this hypothesis explains the fact that this large insertion contains tandemly repeated coding  genes and tes.

gene gains and changes in gene structure and/or expression
two novel genes have been generated at the d. mojavensis breakpoints . the gene dmoj\gi <dig>  localized at 2h proximal breakpoint , comprises two exons encoding a 94-aa protein . a similarity search indicated that it is related to the gene pasha , that is found in the distal breakpoint . pasha has five exons and encodes a 655-aa protein with a double-strand rna binding domain that is involved in primary mirna processing, among other biological processes. amino acid identity between dmoj\gi <dig> and pasha proteins is  <dig> % over a 46-aa segment. gene dmoj\gi <dig> has an unknown molecular function but a protein domain pthr <dig> involved in nucleic acid binding was detected with interproscan  <cit> . in addition it is expressed according to modencode d. mojavensis db http://www.modencode.org/, suggesting it is fully functional. this gene arose at the time of the inversion generation as a consequence of the duplication of a  <dig> -kb segment originally containing three genes: cg <dig>  dvir\gj <dig> and pasha . seemingly the duplicated copies of cg <dig> and dvir\gj <dig> were partially lost by deletion whereas the duplicated copy of pasha evolved into the novel gene dmoj\gi <dig> 

another novel gene, dmoj\gi <dig>  is found at the distal breakpoint  of inversion 2q . it arose when this inversion was generated as a consequence of the duplication of a  <dig> -kb segment containing a fragment of gene cg <dig>  this gene encodes a 508-aa protein that has glucose transmembrane transporter activity. dmoj\gi <dig> comprises three exons encoding a 153-aa protein with a 75-aa major facilitator superfamily  domain  <cit> . the conservation of this domain indicates that it is a new functional gene and suggests that it has retained a mfs function.

three inversions entail putative changes in gene structure and/or expression. two gstd <dig> genes in opposite orientation were found at the two d. mojavensis breakpoints of inversion 2c while only one is present in the proximal breakpoint  of the d. virilis chromosome . in order to ascertain the origin of these two genes, a phylogeny of gstd genes in d. mojavensis and d. virilis was built . the two dmoj\gstd <dig> genes are co-orthologs of the dvir\gstd <dig> gene and we estimated the age of the duplication event that generated them  as  <dig> myr. therefore, this duplication event took place before inversion 2c and the inversion breakpoint occurred between two pre-existing duplicated gstd <dig> genes. gstd <dig> genes have been associated with the detoxification of insecticides as well as other chemical substances present at larval food sources  <cit> . low et al.  <cit>  detected that positive selection has operated on gstd <dig> and identified the parallel evolution of a radical glycine to lysine amino acid change  in d. melanogaster, d. pseudoobscura and d. mojavensis. matzkin  <cit>  found additional evidence for the adaptive evolution of dmoj\gstd1a, a gene that shows changes of expression level in response to the use of different host plants as larval substrates  <cit> . inversion 2c relocated gstd1a to a new chromosomal region and left the other copy gstd1b in the original position. this might have triggered changes in their gene expression regulation and/or evolutionary constraints. the two d. mojavensis gstd <dig> proteins differ by  <dig> aa including the critical  <dig> residue . in addition, according to d. mojavensis modencode db the relocated gstd1a gene has seemingly a much higher expression level than the gene in the original location, gstd1b. we suggest that the gstd <dig> duplication and subsequent separation of the two copies by inversion 2c may have had significant consequences for the adaptation of the lineage of d. mojavensis and related species of the mulleri complex to its cactophilic niche .

the 2r distal breakpoint was localized in d. virilis between two hsp <dig> genes oriented head-to-head . these two genes have the same structure and size  and nearly identical sequence . however, in d. mojavensis hsp68a  is significantly shorter than hsp68b  and posses two exons encoding a 152-aa protein . the two genes only show conservation of a segment encoding 90-aa corresponding to a heat shock protein domain . we built a phylogeny of hsp <dig> in  <dig> drosophila genomes . while a single hsp <dig> gene is present in the six melanogaster group species, two copies oriented head-to-head are found in d. pseudoobscura, d. persimilis, d. grimshawi and d. virilis. thus, this is likely to be the ancestral state. nonetheless the phylogenetic tree shows a high similarity between the two hsp <dig> copies present within each of these four species  that can be interpreted as the result of concerted evolution by recurrent gene conversion or ectopic recombination  <cit> . in d. mojavensis, inversion 2r relocated hsp68b to a new chromosomal site along with its upstream regulatory sequences. a detailed sequence analysis confirms that the dmoj\hsp68b 5' upstream region harbors two cis-regulatory motifs called hses  modulating the expression of this gene  <cit> . but we also detect a third hse,  <dig> bp upstream of the dmoj\hsp68b 5' region, in opposite orientation to the previous two hses. this putative cis-regulatory motif is likely to correspond to the hse of dmoj\hsp68a, apparently dragged by the inversion to the bd region upstream of dmoj\hsp68b. in addition, only ~ <dig>  kb upstream of this gene is the ~90-kb block of histone genes and tes . because tes may influence chromatin organization  <cit>  and this in turn is a significant determinant of gene expression  <cit> , the insertion of this block is likely to have altered the expression level and/or pattern of dmoj\hsp68b. no promoter or regulatory hse sequences were detected upstream of dmoj\hsp68a but according to d. mojavensis modencode db this gene is being transcribed. it may be that it has recruited a new promoter  and acquired a new function or it is on the way to becoming a pseudogene. it must be recalled that dmoj\hsp68a shows an altered structure and a high rate of sequence divergence . in summary, we found that inversion 2r has induced significant alterations of this gene in both structure and expression.

a footprint of a but <dig> was found in the d. mojavensis proximal breakpoint of inversion 2s,  <dig> bp from the start codon of cg <dig> . we used mcpromoter http://tools.igsp.duke.edu/generegulation/mcpromoter/ <cit>  to look for the dmoj\cg <dig> promoter. a unique putative promoter region was located 115-bp 5' from the start codon. this putative promoter region  includes the but <dig> footprint and has a peak with high score  located in region b . in addition it corresponds to a model  <dig> promoter . these observations contrast with the promoter region of dmel\cg <dig> that is model  <dig>  and has a narrow peak with a lower score  and imply that the 2s inversion and the but <dig> element have likely altered the expression of dmoj\cg <dig>  presumably increasing it. gene cg <dig> has a single dnaj domain and is the likely orthologous of human dnajc <dig> gene, a member of the hsp <dig> family.

discussion
in this study, we investigated the rapid chromosomal evolution of the d. mojavensis lineage that has fixed ten paracentric inversions since the repleta group ancestor, ~ <dig> mya . using d. buzzatii bac-end sequences  <cit>  and the genome sequences of d. mojavensis and d. virilis  <cit>  we mapped, identified, annotated and analyzed all breakpoints of the seven inversions fixed in d. mojavensis chromosome  <dig>  the most dynamic element. the results corroborated previous cytological analyses  <cit>  and allowed us to provide significant information on the causes and consequences of these structural changes.

one hypothesis that may explain an accelerated chromosomal evolution rate is an increased mutation rate that generates more rearrangements per generation. this possibility was invoked to explain the high rate of chromosomal rearrangement between d. miranda and d. pseudoobscura  <cit> . because inversions may be generated by tes , one possible cause of high mutation rate is an increased transpositional activity. therefore, it has been suggested that variation in transpositional activity of tes might contribute to variation in rates of rearrangement fixation  <cit> . however, an increased mutation rate could also be due to the presence of other causes, both intrinsic and extrinsic . overall, our results do not support this hypothesis because the inversions fixed in d. mojavensis seem the result of multiple generation mechanisms. we found direct evidence for the implication of transposon but <dig> in the generation of inversion 2s and only circumstantial evidence for the implication of the transposons but <dig> and galileo in inversions 2c and 2r, respectively. inversions 2h and 2q harbor inverted duplications of non-repetitive dna at the two breakpoints and were likely generated by staggered single-strand breaks and repair by non-homologous end joining. finally, no definitive conclusion can be drawn about the generation of inversions 2f and 2g. it could be argued that the latter inversions might have been generated by tes but subsequent changes in the breakpoint regions hindered our ability to find conclusive evidence for their implication. te copies might have excised and move to other locations after generating the inversion , or be deleted due to the high rate of loss of nonfunctional dna in drosophila  <cit> . however, in the absence of supporting evidence we think that such inference is unwarranted.

in any case, the generation of inversion 2s by transposon but <dig> is a significant finding because, in dipterans, the implication of tes in the generation of chromosomal inversions has been demonstrated for a few polymorphic rearrangements but never for fixed inversions . but <dig> is a mite with unusual features . it was discovered in d. buzzatii  <cit>  but is present in the genome of most repleta group species, implying that it was probably already present in the ancestor ~ <dig> mya . in d. mojavensis is relatively abundant and transpositionally active but copy density in the dynamic chromosome  <dig> is not significantly higher than in the rest of chromosomes. these observations do not support the increased mutation hypothesis.

a second explanation for accelerated chromosomal evolution is an increase of the species' population size because the rate of fixation of selectively advantageous rearrangements is a direct function of population size  <cit> . the high rate of chromosomal evolution of the d. yakuba lineage in comparison with the d. melanogaster lineage was attributed to differences in population size  <cit> . the effective population size of d. mojavensis has been estimated as ~ <dig> yet there is variation between populations in baja california and mainland sonora  <cit> . however, there is no reason to assume that this is an unusually high figure. population size of d. arizonae, its closest relative , is seemingly higher  than that of d. mojavensis  <cit> . in contrast to d. mojavensis, which is fixed for five species-specific inversions, d. arizonae has only one  <cit> . therefore, population size does not provide an adequate explanation for d. mojavensis rapid chromosomal evolution.

the third hypothesis is strong natural selection in a new environment that increases the number of fixed inversions. d. mojavensis is the only mulleri complex species inhabiting the sonoran desert. other species of this complex, including its closest relatives d. arizonae and d. navojoa , live in less harsh environments of central and southern mexico. thus it must be presumed that adaptation to the extreme conditions of the sonoran desert and to the exclusive host plants exploited by d. mojavensis must have required many adaptive genetic changes. chromosomal inversions in drosophila have been considered for decades as adaptive devices that spread in natural populations driven by natural selection . in fact there is ample evidence for the adaptive significance of polymorphic inversions  but no such evidence has been provided for fixed inversions . we have found a variety of gene alterations at the breakpoints of d. mojavensis chromosome inversions and propose that these alterations contributed to their adaptive value. overall, strong natural selection in a new harsh environment seems the most plausible cause for d. mojavensis rapid chromosomal evolution.

the alterations associated with the breakpoints of five d. mojavensis inversions include two gene gains  and three putative alterations of gene structure and/or expression regulation . we discuss these effects in turn. in d. mojavensis two new genes were generated associated to inversions 2q and 2h. as a consequence of the generation mechanism, staggered breakage and nhej repair, duplications of single-copy dna were present at the breakpoints of these inversions at the onset. in the case of inversion 2q this duplication included gene cg <dig> . the novel gene dmoj\gi <dig> is shorter than the original gene cg <dig> but retains a mfs domain and could function as a sugar transmembrane transporter . in the case of inversion 2h the duplicated segment included originally three genes . only one gene  seems to have survived. this gene is related to pasha  and according to modencode data, it is expressed. we suggest that novel genes might have contributed to the adaptive value of these inversions. novel genes are widely recognized as a source of new functions  <cit>  but inversion-associated duplication has not been considered a molecular mechanism that can generate new genes until very recently and only in prokaryotes  <cit> .

the two most recent inversions, 2r and 2s, that are exclusive to d. mojavensis, show putative alterations of structure and/or expression of heat shock protein  genes. hsp genes encode intra-cellular chaperones for other proteins and have been established as potential candidates for thermotolerance  <cit> . hsp family harbors genes constitutively or inducibley expressed  <cit> . heat-inducible genes are regulated by heat shock factor , which binds to hse sequences  <cit>  whereas other heat shock genes have an hsf-independent regulation  <cit> . the distal breakpoint of inversion 2r separated two previously linked and very similar hsp <dig> genes . one of them, hsp68a, remained in its original location but suffered a radical change in structure and sequence. it may have acquired a new function and expression pattern or may be in the process of becoming a pseudogene. the other gene, hsp68b, apparently kept its hse regulatory elements but was relocated to a completely new chromatin environment and is now found near a ~90-kb block composed of histone genes and tes. it is difficult to imagine that the expression of this gene has not been affected by these changes. genes of the heat- inducible hsp <dig> family  are positively related to thermotolerance but overexpression has survival costs and it seems that hsp <dig> concentration has an intermediate optimum  <cit> . some african populations of d. melanogaster with an exceptional thermotolerance show decreased levels of hsp <dig> expression, caused by the insertion of tes in one of the promoter regions of the hsp70ba gene  <cit> . in d. mojavensis an altered expression of hsp <dig> genes could contribute to its exceptional thermotolerance. on the other hand, the proximal breakpoint of inversion 2s was located upstream of cg <dig>  a gene with a dnaj domain that likely belongs to the constitutively expressed hsp <dig> family. in d. melanogaster, hsp <dig> is up-regulated in mutants lacking hsf  <cit>  and probably has an essential role in thermotolerance  <cit> . thus the changes induced by inversion 2s and but <dig> insertion in the promoter of cg <dig> likely conferred an adaptive advantage to d. mojavensis by increasing its thermotolerance. it can be hypothesized that the alterations of the heat inducible hsp <dig> genes caused by inversion 2r and the putative positive effect on the expression level of the constitutive gene cg <dig> caused by inversion 2s were in some way related and jointly contributed to the d. mojavensis unusual thermotolerance. this hypothesis might explain the rapid and exclusive fixation of both inversions in the d. mojavensis lineage.

by no means do we imply that the alterations unveiled at the breakpoints are the only cause of the d. mojavensis inversion adaptive significance. inversions are not simple point mutations but complex structural changes involving hundreds of loci that may suffer further mutations along their evolutionary trajectory. therefore we consider that the multiple explanations for the adaptive spread of inversions  are not mutually exclusive alternatives. this means that different inversions may be successful for different reasons but also that a single inversion may increase in frequency for different reasons along its trajectory. for instance, an inversion could gain an initial drive because of the alterations it causes at the breakpoints and incorporate afterwards interacting mutations that led to coadaptation or that increase local adaptation that further propel the inversion towards fixation. the molecular explanations for the role of chromosomal inversions in adaptation and speciation are only beginning to be disentangled.

CONCLUSIONS
the breakpoint characterization of seven inversions fixed in d. mojavensis has provided significant information on the causes and consequences of these rearrangements. multiple generation mechanisms seem to have acted in this lineage, an observation that does not support a mutational explanation for d. mojavensis rapid chromosomal evolution. on the other hand, we have found a set of alterations at the inversion breakpoints with potential adaptive significance, including novel genes and changes in structure and/or expression of adjacent genes. overall, our results are consistent with natural selection as an explanation for the rapid chromosomal evolution in this specialist organism living under extreme ecological conditions.
