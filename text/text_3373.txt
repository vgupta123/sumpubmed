BACKGROUND
branching morphogenesis is a common mechanism of mammalian development , and has been a classic topic of study for generations of developmental biologists  <cit> . based on recent findings regarding signal transduction pathways and transcriptional control, it has reasonably been proposed that all branching systems use variations of a canonical developmental program  <cit> . ectodysplasin-a, a protein required for epithelial differentiation, appears to be an important constituent of such a program.

ectodysplasin-a  is mapped to the x-chromosome  <cit> . eda is a glycosylated, oligomeric type ii membrane protein with three collagenous repeat domains and a tnf homology domain  <cit> . eda is shed from the cell membrane and binds as a trimer to its trimerized cognate receptor   <cit> . like tnf/tnfr signaling, eda/edar signaling is thought to be primarily through the canonical nfκb pathway  <cit> . the initial appearance of eda and edar proteins in late pseudoglandular/canalicular stage  submandibular salivary glands  in vivo indicate that they participate in late branching morphogenesis and histodifferentiation  <cit> . in vitro study of the eda/edar pathway in embryonic smg development indicates that this pathway is important for epithelial cell proliferation, lumina formation, and histodifferentiation; exogenous eda delivered to smg explants upregulate nfκb activation and nuclear localization  <cit> .

mutations in mouse eda or its human homologue eda result in hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia , a syndrome variably characterized by absent or hypoplastic teeth, hair, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, lacrimal glands, salivary glands, mammary glands and/or nipples, and mucous glands of the bronchial, esophageal and colonic mucosa  <cit> .

the mouse edata  allele is characterized by a ~ <dig> kb deletion  <cit> . specifically, genomic dna hybridized with an exon  <dig> probe shows a deletion including the coding region, and primers for dna flanking exon  <dig> fail to amplify in a pcr assay . importantly, rt-pcr assays of embryonic edata  skin reveals that edata transcript levels are about 10–20% of that seen in the wildtype  <cit> . this may reflect the fact that dna sequences that regulate gene transcription occupy no fixed position relative to coding dna regions and are often diffuse and widely dispersed, including secondary  enhancers  <cit> . secondary enhancers map far from the target gene and mediate activities overlapping the primary enhancer, accounting for why deletions of well-defined enhancers are sometimes associated with weak or no phenotypic abnormality  <cit> .

in this study, we utilized edata  mutant mice to investigate the in vivo relationship between eda/edar signaling and progressive  smg morphogenesis and histodifferentiation. our investigation reveals that, from the outset , embryonic tabby smgs are smaller, exhibit fewer branches, and are developmentally delayed compared to wildtype  glands. by e <dig>  tabby glands remain smaller with fewer presumptive acini than wt, though both display a similar degree of terminal differentiation , as evidenced by mucin  protein expression. the key question is how altered eda function is related to abnormal smg ontogeny.

developmental biology has progressed from studying one or two molecules at a time to studying scores of molecules. such studies require complex experiments and mathematical analyses of their results. while the preferred approach for data analysis has been statistical, its value is limited for mechanistic understanding of signal transduction, mostly because the approach is correlational. to understand how a specific ligand/receptor binding  produces a change in cell/tissue behavior, one is compelled to utilize a dynamic model of a larger relevant genetic subcircuit. such dynamic models allow one to test different sets of unbiased assumptions and determine if the predicted behavior matches the actual.

thus, the wider goal of the present study was to understand how a marked reduction in functional eda propagates with time through a defined subcircuit that includes  <dig> signaling pathways that are both critical for smg ontogeny and share post-activation downstream targets. more specifically, it was the central objective of our extensive quantitative study to demonstrate the way in which a mechanistic pathway diagram can be programmatically transformed to a corresponding system of ordinary differential equations in order to quantitatively test the proposition that the canonical nfκb signaling cascade is sufficient to account for the differential quantitative expression of developmentally-regulated genes in the context of eda polymorphism .

quantitative gene expression analysis and mechanistic kinetic modeling reveal that the edata allele is associated with significantly downregulated edar, shh and fgf <dig> expression, and vastly upregulated egf/tgfα/egfr expression. further, the results revealed that eda/edar signaling is not a major determinant of nfκb signaling in normal and mutant tabby smg development; rather, tnf is. moreover, the evidence strongly points to the existence of an important, alternative eda-initiated transcriptional control pivotal to smg development. these results are likely to be applicable to other branching organs affected by eda  mutation.

RESULTS
the smg in the adult tabby mouse is smaller than the wildtype  gland and is characterized by decreased granular convoluted ducts and acini; there is a significant decrease in mucin protein in the hypoplastic tabby smgs compared to wt, but not more than expected given the gland size differences  <cit> . to elucidate the natural history of the pathogenesis, we compared the developmental phenotypes of embryonic  days 13– <dig> tabby and wt smgs and relate these to multiple gene expression and putative functional integration of related pathways.

progressive pathogenesis of tabby smgs
from the outset, embryonic tabby smgs are smaller, exhibit fewer branches and are developmentally delayed compared to wt glands . at e <dig>  the tabby gland is characterized by a solid epithelial stalk ending in a bulb and achieving the initial bud stage , whereas the wt gland exhibits deep clefts and the formation of 3– <dig> epithelial buds   . moreover, although the pseudoglandular stage, composed of a network of epithelial branches and terminal buds, is achieved in e <dig> wt smgs , the tabby gland has only progressed to late initial bud stage on e <dig>  and does not achieve the pseudoglandular stage until e <dig> . this developmental delay of approximately  <dig> day persists in tabby glands, with the canalicular stage being seen in e <dig> wt and e <dig> tabby glands  and the early terminal bud stage being seen in e <dig> wt and e <dig> tabby glands . the initial detection of immunolocalized mucin protein in tabby e <dig> glands, as well as the similarity of its distribution pattern to e <dig> wt glands, indicates that tabby proacinar maturation is also delayed, but not precluded . at e <dig>  the tabby glands remain smaller and exhibit fewer presumptive acini than e <dig> wt glands , a hypoplastic phenotype. nevertheless, both e <dig> wt and tabby smgs display distinct proacinar lumina bounded by a single layer of cuboidal epithelium and filled with mucin protein, as well as continuity between ductal and proacinar lumina . this similarity in e <dig> tabby and wt phenotypes indicates that terminal differentiation  is less affected by the edata mutation.

gene expression
a key principle of signaling and transcriptional regulation of development is that a wide array of ontogenic effects can emerge from a relatively small number of individual molecular components  <cit> . this nonlinear process is dependent on the functional integration of information transmitted by diverse pathways. many such pathways in smg ontogeny have been identified . the putative functional relationships within and between pathways have been modeled for mouse smgs as the estimative equivalent of a "café napkin" sketch, namely a diagrammatic genetic network  <cit> .

mapping genes to their function is called the "genotype-to-phenotype problem," where phenotype is whatever is changed in the organism when a gene's function is altered  <cit> . because developmental regulation is both robust and degenerate, it is limiting to simply investigate the average effects of single network genes across samples, large or small  <cit> . rather, we are compelled to map genotype to phenotype within the context of the underlying complexity of the networks that regulate cellular functions  <cit> .

here we investigated a subcircuit  that includes  <dig> probative genes  in  <dig> signaling pathways that are both critical to smg ontogeny and share post-activation downstream targets: eda, tnf, il <dig>  egf, fgf  <cit> . this approach has proven very useful, not least because it is experimentally constrained and computationally accessible  <cit> . below we present novel emergent properties that would not be otherwise evident.

* r = Σr/n, where gene expression  is "normalized" to wt-e <dig> , and n ≥  <dig>  thus, entries in each cell are mean values ; values greater or lesser than  <dig> are significant at p <  <dig>  or less.

* r = Σr/n, where gene expression  is "normalized" to wt-e <dig> , and n ≥  <dig>  thus, entries in each cell are mean values ; values greater or lesser than  <dig> are significant at p <  <dig>  or less.

wt gene expression
we determined the sequential time-dependent changes in the expression of  <dig> genes from the earliest time of immunodetectable eda and edar to newborn by quantitative rt-pcr. the presentation of wildtype  gene expression data for embryonic day  <dig>  to newborn  is found in table  <dig>  the relative expression ratio  is the mean increase or decrease in gene expression in wt glands compared to a single standard, wt e <dig> glands, the earliest time of eda and edar protein expression. these data are particularly heuristic in our attempt to more fully expand upon what is already known about the control of embryonic smg branching from prior genotype to phenotype analyses  <cit> .

normal terminal bud stage  maturation is critical to subsequent acini and ductal terminal differentiation, postnatally. the steady state gene expression of fgf <dig> and fgfr <dig>  and the more dramatic 20+ fold upregulation of fgf <dig>  suggests that the fgf pathways are important to terminal bud stage maturation in the same way they are prior to this stage. this also may be said of the functionally related shh gene expression. progression from the pseudoglandular stage to the canalicular stage, and continued epithelial branching, also includes eda/edar, tnf and il <dig> signaling through the canonical nfκb pathway. the importance of these pathways for terminal bud stage maturation appears considerably diminished: eda, edar, edaradd, tnf, il <dig>  and nfkb <dig> gene expression are significantly  downregulated. finally, the egf/tgfα/egfr pathway regulates the rate of branching and histodifferentiation in preparation for progression from the canalicular stage to the terminal bud stage. the steady state of egf expression and the significant upregulation of tgfα and egfr suggest the importance of this signaling pathways through early terminal bud stage ; however, beyond this point there is a highly significant  decline in egf, tgfα, and egfr expression, suggesting a greatly diminished role in smg maturation.

tabby gene expression
to determine if the sequential expression of these important  <dig> genes differs in tabby smgs from that seen in wt smgs, we also compared tabby e <dig> to nb to the same standard . the presentation of tabby smg gene expression data for e <dig> to nb, and its comparison to wt is found in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  it is readily apparent that embryonic edata smgs have many highly significant  gene expression differences as compared to wt. such differences have always to be viewed in the context of progressive smg pathogenesis .

though eda gene expression in embryonic edata smgs are 3–19% that of wt, in the early terminal bud stage there is a 4-fold increase in nfkb <dig> gene expression relative to wt . this may largely be explained by the concomitant 11-fold increase in tnf expression, tnf being a powerful inducer of nfκb activation in smgs  <cit> . by mid to late terminal bud stage, this response is replaced by near normal nfkb <dig> and tnf expression , and dramatically upregulated egf/tgfα/egfr expression: egf by a relative 10– <dig> fold; tgfα by a relative 10– <dig> fold, egfr by a relative  <dig> – <dig> fold . this unexpected upregulation of egf/tgfα/egfr message is reflected in the expression of immunodetectable proteins , with a substantial increase in egf, tgfα, and egfr proteins being seen in tabby smgs as compared to wt glands. at the same time, diminished eda expression is associated with significantly  downregulated shh and fgf <dig> expression, an outcome previously shown to be correlated with severe smg pathology  <cit> . shh and fgf <dig> are known to positively and reciprocally regulate one another in smgs  <cit> . still, while shh and fgf <dig> expression in wt smgs is highly correlated  and the variation of one accounts for nearly all of the variation in the other, in edata smgs they are not at all correlated , one accounting for less than 4% of the variation in the other.

in summary, then, the pathology of edata smgs, relative to the circumscribed signaling subcircuit , is associated with downregulated shh and fgf <dig> gene expression. perhaps, as a mark of this subcircuit's robustness, the potential severity of the smg pathology may be mitigated by vastly upregulated egf/tgfα/egfr gene expression  and protein expression . these results naturally raise questions regarding the underlying mechanism that links the loss-of-function edata mutation to the positive and negative regulation of the  <dig> genes just noted , and the overall putative relationship to nfκb-mediated gene regulation.

network analysis
the expression of an individual gene in a developing organ is not a soliloquy; rather, it acts in a chorus of quantitative functional relations appropriately termed a genetic circuit, network or connections map. it is the task of systems biology to quantitatively define and analyze the parts  of the whole, the goal being to put it all together in the future  <cit> . to do this, two effective strategies have emerged. one seeks to infer biologic pathways from large data sets and increasingly powerful software tools for managing and searching literature and pathway databases  <cit> . the second seeks to construct and test increasingly complex mechanistic models of biologic systems  <cit> . here we have combined these strategies to determine the way in which a mechanistic pathway diagram  can be programmatically transformed to a corresponding system of ordinary differential equations in order to quantitatively test the proposition that the canonical nfκb signaling cascade is sufficient to account for the differential quantitative expression of developmentally regulated genes in the context of eda polymorphism .

pathway and literature databases were mined for processes that interrelate a quantitatively measured panel of genes which are critical to smg development . mined processes were assembled into a mechanistic kinetic framework and the model was tested for consistency with the wt and tabby quantitative rt-pcr derived expression data. the resulting best-fit mechanistic system diagram contains  <dig> states  in  <dig> cellular locations , and  <dig> processes . the system diagram is too large to be displayed legibly on a journal page, but is provided as a scalable pdf file in additional file  <dig>  along with access to all the equations and parameters for both wt and tabby data sets, as well as the fits of the quantitative experimental data .

previous systems analyses have utilized computational methods that allow ready deduction of genetic network connectivity and functional properties solely from gene expression data, temporal or not  <cit> . still, recent studies in yeast and e. coli compel the caveat that the ratios of protein levels between mutant and wt may not have a one-to-one correlation with those of the corresponding mrnas  <cit> . further, since the mechanistic diagram inevitably includes a large number of proteins as well as expressed mrnas, we concede at the outset that gene expression data alone are not sufficient to allow highly detailed parameter identification of the downstream protein networks.

fortunately, the kinetic characteristics of signaling circuits provide general constraints that support quantitative analysis of gene expression data in isolation. first, it is generally agreed that protein transport from the site of synthesis in the er to the cell surface requires no more than  <dig> minutes  <cit> . second, it is widely acknowledged that signaling pathways require on the order of only two minutes to convey information from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. since the developmental time courses we analyze include transients on a time scale of  <dig> to  <dig> days, we adopted the working hypothesis that signal transduction events  are fast relative to the dynamics of transcription, mrna turnover, translation and protein turnover. this simplification allows a full mechanistic test of a complex hypothetical model even in the absence of experimental protein kinetic data on secreted cytokines and growth factors, activated enzymes, and transcription factors .

it is readily apparent that eda is not a major determinant of nfκb signaling. this conclusion is inescapable given the large number of genes in the model  whose transcription is reported to be significantly regulated by canonical nfκb. given our working assumption that all differences between wt and tabby developmental mrna profiles are secondary to differential eda expression, it must follow that if eda is the dominant determinant of eda/edar signaling, then the tabby state of many-fold less eda must propagate in this kinetic model  into much reduced expression of genes whose transcription is significantly regulated by nfκb. to the contrary, only  <dig>  of the  <dig> genes thought to be nfκb response genes  have dramatically different time courses in wt and tabby smgs . this strongly suggests that eda is not a major determinant of nfκb activation in smg branching morphogenesis, and presages the existence of an additional eda-initiated transcriptional control of the  <dig> genes: edar, fgf <dig>  shh, egf.

concomitantly, it is informative to consider nfkb <dig> gene expression itself. the mechanistic model  accounts for the observed significant, but transient, decrease in wt and tabby smgs ; nfkb <dig> expression has essentially the same time course in wt and tabby smgs . interestingly, the mechanistic model  demonstrates that the resulting decrease in protein synthesis is largely buffered by the pre-existing cytoplasmic pool of nfκb <dig>  and thus the downregulation of nfkb <dig> has little effect on the propagation of eda, fgf <dig>  and tnf induced signals to the nucleus. further, since prior smg studies demonstrated that a significant portion of the activation and nuclear translocation of nfκb can be accounted for by the variation in tnf signaling  <cit> , we tested and corroborated the hypothesis that tnf, not eda, is the dominant controller of ikk activation in developing wt and tabby smgs .

to address this question further, we employed an in vitro loss-of-function strategy to determine if loss of canonical nfκb function abrogates eda-enhanced smg branching and maturation. we utilized sn <dig>  a cell permeable inhibitor of nfκb translocation into the nucleus  <cit> , at a concentration  previously shown to entirely preclude tnf- and eda-induced nfκb nuclear translocation and to significantly inhibit embryonic smg branching . to enhance smg branching, we used  <dig> ng/ml eda-a <dig> in a manner previously reported  <cit> . thus, e <dig> explants were cultured for  <dig> days  in the presence of  <dig> ng/ml eda-a <dig>   <dig> μg/ml sn <dig>  or  <dig> ng/ml eda-a <dig> +  <dig> μg/ml sn50; controls consisted of e <dig> explants cultured in control medium alone.

eda supplementation induces a substantial increase  and sn <dig> induces a marked decrease  in embryonic smg branching morphogenesis and terminal differentiation, as indicated by mucin protein expression. the presence of exogenous eda supplementation in sn50-treated explants "rescued" the sn50-induced abnormal phenotype and restored it toward that seen in controls . note that eda + sn50-treated glands exhibit a marked increase in epithelial terminal buds, lumina formation, and immunodetectable mucin protein compared to glands treated with sn <dig> alone . taken together, our results would indicate that a fully functional nfκb pathway is not the sine qua non for eda signaling, and that eda signaling likely uses additional, more critical and yet unidentified, pathway.

these conclusions were supported by gene expression analysis . sn50-treated explants show a decline in gene expression of  <dig> of  <dig> nfκb <dig> response genes . an optimized  gene expression model was derived, resulting in a molecular signature that was able to distinguish between sn50-treated and eda-treated explants with 100% sensitivity and specificity . more importantly, when we used the derived model to classify the gene expression data of eda + sn50-treated explants, we found that all eda + sn50-treated explants  were classified as "eda-treated" and none were classified as "sn50-treated." this is consistent with the histologic "rescue"  and again suggests eda signaling uses pathways in addition to nfκb.

within our gene expression datasets , there are four growth factors and two growth factor receptors whose quantitative expression time courses are dramatically different in tabby smgs relative to wt: egf, tgfα, shh, fgf <dig>  edar, egfr . the mechanistic model  is internally consistent with some of these but totally incapable of accounting for others. for shh and fgf <dig>  the small differences in nuclear nfκb <dig> caused by differential tnf signaling plus the purported feedback of these genes on one another are sufficient to explain the temporal phenotypes of tabby gene expression reasonably well. for egf and edar, the necessity for a second  eda-induced transcriptional regulator is clearly indicated by the discrepancies between model solution and mrna expression data. for tgfα and egfr, the model solutions are internally consistent but the link to eda remains unknown. that is, the model can correctly propagate the different temporal phenotypes of wt and tabby gene expression, but the model cannot explain the causal chain of events that links these genes to eda. these discrepancies and missing links compelled us to consider an alternative mechanistic explanation and refine the model.

to wit, we hypothesized and tested the alternative model that a second pathway is activated by eda/edar signaling, and that its activated transcription factor  regulates the six differently expressed genes in unique ways . with this addition, all six quantitative gene expression time courses are now internally consistent with and accounted for by the mechanistic model. further, it is possible to deduce whether the added transcriptional regulation is positive or negative. if gene expression is decreased in tabby smgs, tfx must be a positive regulator of that gene. conversely, if gene expression is increased in tabby smgs, then tfx must be a negative regulator of transcription. examination of the quantitative gene expression data  reveals that there are three of each: edar, shh and fgf <dig> are positively regulated by the eda-activated tfx; egf, tgfα, and egfr are negatively regulated . the identity of tfx is presently uncertain. however, further in silico, in vivo and in vitro investigations suggest a promising candidate.

searching for tfx
regulatory trans-acting transcription factors  activate or repress transcription by physical interaction with genomic cis-regulating dna elements that may be found in promoters or at some distance from the target gene's start site . putative interactions between tfs and their target dna sequences can be identified by web-based tools for searching tf binding sites in dna sequences. using alibaba  <dig> , transfac  <dig> , match  <dig> , and p-match  <dig>  , we determined that the most probable identity of tfx is ccaat/enhancer binding protein alpha . c/ebpα is part of a family of leucine zipper proteins that control the differentiation of many cell types, as well as regulate cell proliferation  <cit> . gene and protein analyses are consistent with our in silico result and model prediction . quantitative rt-pcr reveals a 60% decline in cebpa message in tabby glands relative to wt at e <dig>  and a 25% decline at e <dig>  in addition, there is a dramatic reduction in activated, nuclear-localized c/ebpα protein in tabby smgs relative to wt smgs at e <dig> . to further delineate the relationship between eda/edar signaling and c/ebpα, we compared the spatial distribution of c/ebpα protein in eda-treated and control e <dig> +  <dig> explants . enhanced eda/edar signaling in vitro induces a notable increase in activated, nuclear-localized c/ebpα protein. taken together, our in vivo and in vitro data suggest that c/ebpα is an eda responsive gene, thus a promising tfx candidate.

the ability of c/ebpα to regulate differentiation and proliferation in a context-specific manner often depends on the presence of specific collaborating tfs  <cit> . composite cis-regulating elements are combinations of two or more tf binding sites with synergistic regulatory action  <cit> . our model predicts that  <dig> key genes  would contain nfκb/c/ebpα composite elements . scanning all known human 5'-flanking sequences, shelest et al.  <cit>  found that the most abundant composite elements were of the nfκb/c/ebpα type, including one in the egf sequence and another in the sequence of a tnf receptor superfamily member. applying the model for composite elements of the nfκb/c/ebpα type  <cit> , we determined that such putative composite elements were also present in the murine sequences of shh, fgf <dig>  edar, and egf.

that c/ebpα is the identity of postulated tfx in the model  is far from certain. still, it is an informed hypothesis which can be tested further with protein-protein and protein-dna interaction assays of high sensitivity and specificity, among other strategies.

discussion
in  <dig>  charles darwin presented a meticulous description of what we now know as x-linked hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia : "i may give an analogous case, communicated to me by mr. w. wedderburn of a hindoo  family in scinde, in which ten men, in the course of four generations, were furnished, in both jaws taken together, with only four small and weak incisor teeth and with eight posterior molars. the men thus affected have very little hair on their body, and become bald early in life. they also suffer much during hot weather from excessive dryness of their skin. it is remarkable that no instance has occurred of a daughter being affected...though they transmit the tendency to their sons; and no case has occurred of a son transmitting it to his sons"  <cit> .

patients with x-linked hed have since been shown to also have smg hypoplasia and variably reduced salivary secretion  <cit> . the reduced saliva flow results in dryness of the oral mucosa and predisposes xlhed patients to dental caries and candida albicans infections. tabby  is a mouse homologue of human xlhed, a model of the human syndrome that displays near identity. adult edata smgs are hypoplastic with decreased granular convoluted ducts and acini, and there is a notable decrease in immunodetectable mucin protein  <cit> . prior studies of in vitro smg ontogeny suggested that eda/edar signaling effects epithelial cell proliferation, lumen formation, and histodifferentiation via the canonical nfκb pathway  <cit> . of great interest, although edata results in a severely diminished functional eda ligand  <cit> , hemizygosity  and homozygosity  for the mutant allele result in variable  adult  smg hypoplasia, not aplasia  <cit> .

the reproductive success of mus musculus, homo sapiens and other thriving organisms is in no small measure due to their robustness against perturbations, including gene mutation. this robustness may be seen at all levels of biologic organization from gene expression to terminal organ differentiation and function. what might be the basis of "robustian" rescue  from perturbations? several recent lines of experimental evidence suggest that cells, and their genetic regulatory networks, are dynamically critical  <cit> . such critical dynamical systems, poised between dynamical order and chaos, maximize the correlated behavior of variables in systems of many variables and maximize the diversity of what they can do as they become larger  <cit> . in the present study, we sought to detect and measure the degree of smg developmental robustness, and to elucidate its underlying genetic mechanism.

we began by clarifying the in vivo ontogeny of edataassociated smg pathology . from the initial bud stage  on, tabby smgs are smaller, exhibit fewer branches and are developmentally delayed compared to wt glands. this is consistent with the findings that in immunodetected in the late pseudoglandular/early canalicular stage   <cit> . of note, though eda protein is detectable through the late terminal bud stage , comparison of e <dig> tabby and wt proacinar phenotypes indicates that terminal differentiation  is less affected by eda loss-of-function.

our prior in vitro study  <cit>  clearly showed that control glands express very little activated nfκb, but enhanced eda/edar signaling induces a very significant increase in activated nfκb. what we did not show was whether or not canonical nfκb activation was necessary or sufficient for in vivo eda/edar signaling. we had our doubts because baltimore's group  <cit>  had shown that p50-/- mice have normal development, except for some postnatal  defects in immune responses. further, we investigated the ikbα transgenic mouse created by schmidt-ullrich's group  <cit>  and the smgs are normal .

branching morphogenesis is not a simple dichotomous trait, one we mark present or absent. rather, it is a complex quantitative trait. defining the interactions that occur among the genes that underlie the process of branching is essential to understanding its variability. when a gene that is critical to this developmental process mutates, the differentiating cells reprogram transcription via a cognate genetic circuit, ultimately altering the expression of the many genes beyond the mutated one. as such, the phenotype of a given genotype cannot be simply predicted by the sum of its component single-locus effects, but must take account of the almost certain epistasis in gene function  <cit> . the most efficient way of doing this is by systems analysis, correlation modeling for hypothesis generation  and kinetic  modeling for hypothesis testing  <cit> .

the molecular pathology of embryonic tabby  smgs is characterized by significantly  downregulated shh and fgf <dig> gene expression, on the order of 50–75% less than wt. typically, this would be expected to be associated with a severely hypoplastic to aplastic gland  <cit> , but this is not the case . one obvious explanation for this is the many-fold upregulation of egf/tgfα/egfr gene  and protein  expression. this dramatic robustness of the studied subcircuit  is largely due to degeneracy, namely the ready availability of multiple parallel pathways at a key "choice point  <cit> . mechanistic modeling reveals that the primary linchpin of this degeneracy is not canonical nfκb as previously supposed  <cit> ; rather, we provide extensive quantitative evidence that the eda/edar/nfκb cascade plays a minor role, apparently neither necessary nor sufficient for smg development. we confirm this with an in vitro strategy that demonstrates that loss of nfκb function does not abrogate eda-enhanced smg branching and differentiation . these outcomes add support to the suggestion by pispa et al  <cit>  of an important nfκb-independent pathway downstream of eda/edar signaling in vivo.

the most parsimonious alternative explanation is a second eda-activated transcription factor  that regulates, alone or complexed with nfκb, the expression of all five target genes: shh, fgf <dig>  egf, tgfα, egfr . our initial in silico and in vivo investigations suggest that the identity of tfx is c/ebpα, a regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . there are likely other, as yet unknown, tfs in the eda/edar pathway. unmasking tfx with certainty, and delineating its participation in transcription factor complexes, could prove formidable  <cit> ; delineating the stochastic variation in cognate gene expression more so  <cit> .

the variable phenotypic expression of human hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia is considerable . this is particularly so for glandular phenotypes . if branching epithelia use variations of a canonical developmental program, the experimental results presented here should be applicable to understanding the variable phenotypic expression of other branching organs affected by eda  mutation.

CONCLUSIONS
our prior studies of in vitro smg branching morphogenesis suggested that eda/edar signaling largely regulates ontogeny through the canonical nfκb pathway  <cit> . the present in vivo quantitative systems analyses indicate that this conclusion must be amended. the need to do so is inescapable because, for most nfκb-regulated genes, the observed time course of gene expression is nearly unchanged in tabby mice as compared to wildtype mice , as is nfκb itself . importantly, a subset of genes is dramatically differentially expressed in the tabby mouse  , strongly suggesting the existence of an alternative eda-mediated transcriptional pathway pivotal for smg branching morphogenesis . experimental and in silico investigations have identified c/ebpα as a promising candidate . finally, it should be noted that upregulation of the egf/tgfα/egfr pathway appears to mitigate the potentially severe abnormal phenotype predicted by the downregulation of fgf <dig> and shh. it has recently been suggested by harris et al. that the buffering of the phenotypic outcome that is coincident with variant eda signaling could be a common mechanism that permits viable and diverse phenotypes, including those we would consider normal  <cit> . our results support this proposition.
