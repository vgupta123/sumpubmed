BACKGROUND
rheumatoid arthritis  is characterised by chronic inflammation and destruction of multiple joints perpetuated by the synovial membrane . a major component of the inflamed sm  are activated, semi-transformed synovial fibroblasts   <cit> . in normal joints, sfb show a balanced expression of proteins, regulating the formation and degradation of the extracellular matrix . in ra, however, sfb are known for predominant expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and tissue-degrading enzymes  <cit> , thus maintaining joint inflammation, degradation of ecm components, and invasion of cartilage and bone. in addition, fibrosis of the affected joints is also driven by sfb, which express enhanced amounts of ecm components such as collagens  <cit> .

central transcription factors  involved as key players in ra pathogenesis  <cit>  and in the activation of sfb in ra patients are ap- <dig>  nf-κb, ets- <dig>  and smads  <cit> . these tfs show binding activity for their cognate recognition sites in the promoters of inflammation-related cytokines  and matrix-degrading target genes  <cit> , e.g., collagenase  and stromelysin <dig> . the latter two show high expression levels in ra  <cit>  and contributes to tissue degradation  <cit>  by destruction of ecm components, including aggrecan or collagen types iv, x, and xi  <cit> .

due to the rapid accumulation of data about biological processes and molecular interrelationships, there is an increasing demand for approaches to analyse the underlying regulatory networks. for instance, a recent analysis of the mrna expression profiles in synovial tissue from ra patients revealed inter-individual and gene-specific variances  <cit> . the underlying mechanisms for such complex behaviour are not understood so far. mathematical and computational models may assist biologists in further research activities by generating predictions and hypotheses that can be experimentally tested. network models, generated on the basis of extracted information and/or experimental data, will considerably facilitate the analysis of interactions among different key molecules and provide new insights into complex biological pathways and interactions . this is of particular importance in the context of rheumatic diseases and cartilage/bone metabolism, since the development of new and/or adapted molecular therapies depends on the understanding of superordinate pathway interrelationships in the pro-inflammatory micro-environment of the joint  <cit> .

therefore, we developed a method for simulating the temporal behaviour of regulatory and signalling networks. it was used to create a gene regulatory network emulating ecm formation and destruction, based on literature information about sfb on the one hand and on experimental data on the other, which we obtained from tgfβ <dig> or tnfα stimulated sfb.

the final simulations were analysed by the attribute exploration algorithm of formal concept analysis , a mathematical discipline that has multiple applications in various domains such as knowledge representation, data mining, semantic web, or software engineering. first fca approaches related to the analysis of gene expression data have been published . using our method, the simulation results and the observed time series were further integrated in a fine-tuned and automated manner resulting in sets of rules that determine system dynamics.

corresponding to the discrete approach of fca, we applied boolean network architecture for modelling. boolean network models, first proposed by kauffman et al.  <cit> , use binary variables that define the expression of a gene i, represented by a network node, as on or off . in biology, this concept is reflected by distinct expression thresholds which must be exceeded by each individual gene to initiate their cellular effects, including disease initiation and progression  <cit> . boolean networks are dynamic models and thus, they require time-series data as input  and generate such data as output . they can be represented as directed graphs, with the nodes labelled by boolean functions. boolean networks are widely used in molecular biology for logical analysis and simulation of medium or large scale networks  <cit> . for example, kervizic et al. developed a method for the cholesterol regulatory pathway in  <dig> species which eliminates spurious cycles in a synchronous boolean network model  <cit> . sets of boolean rules are also applied as so-called knowledge bases in decision support or expert systems.

for our analysis we used a collection of  <dig> genes, which can be classified into five functional groups, sufficient to create a self-contained regulatory network of ecm maintenance:  structural proteins which are the target molecules ;  enzymes degrading them ;  molecules that inhibit these proteases ;  tfs  and modulators acting as tfs  which are regulated by  the external signalling molecules tnfα  and tgfβ <dig> . these genes  are known to be expressed by sfb, except for tnf and mmp <dig>  for which the expression is still under question .

RESULTS
creating a regulatory network by literature extraction
the available literature was screened for genes and proteins involved in ecm maintenance and expressed in the lining layer sfb of the sm. in order to derive a regulatory network, we comprehensively collected literature knowledge related to the formation and degradation of ecm in human fibroblasts and analysed it manually. we chose collagen type i, which is formed by the col1a <dig> and col1a <dig> gene products, as a connective tissue representative, several mmps as ecm-degrading enzymes, their inhibitors, and tfs regulating them. finally, we selected  <dig> genes  and the literature was screened again for gene regulatory relations and interactions connecting them . some contradictory literature findings were resolved manually .

the resulting regulatory network is almost closed and represents the most important ecm network functions. here, we imply that the receptors for the external signalling molecules are always available and functional in sfb. note, that tgfβ <dig>  and tnfα  are the only entities playing a dual role as both external signal molecules and target genes because of their introduction into the simulation as starting effectors.

it turned out that the knowledge about gene regulatory events is limited and that, to the best of our knowledge, the regulation of smad and smad expression has not been fully characterised so far. the smad gene products seem to be available in sufficient amounts and we were unable to find reports about their regulated expression. in addition, not all influences of tgfβ <dig> and tnfα on gene expression could be described as direct effects of transcription factors at the mrna level because the important smad family members act as regulators on the protein-protein interaction level. all influences were included in the network at this point to avoid premature loss of information.

although many tfs such as ap- <dig> are also regulated at the protein level , those effects can be reflected simplistically by regulatory processes at the transcriptional level. however, activating smads as smad <dig> and smad <dig> are also regulated by inhibitory members of the smad family , which may counteract transcriptional activation and add an extra level of complexity  <cit> . therefore, smad <dig> was introduced into the network as a tgfβ1-dependent repressor of smad-dependent transcription.

in the case of smad <dig>  we decided to subsume its influence under the smad <dig> effects because both are described to have nearly identical effects and act in concert. moreover, we could not find well-defined information about smad <dig> regulation. hence, we added an inducing influence of smad <dig> on mmp <dig>  for keeping all the smad effects in the network.

the subunits of the homo- or heterodimer tf ap- <dig>  i.e., jun, junb, jund, and fos , determine its different regulatory activities . therefore, we decided to disassemble the transcriptional active entity ap- <dig> into its subunits. in contrast, for the dimeric tf nf-κb, which composed of the gene products of nfkb <dig>  nfkb <dig>  rela, relb, and/or rel  <cit> , we selected nfkb <dig> as the representative gene with respect to our signalling framework. all the genes and their interrelations were transferred into the program cytoscape  <cit>  to visualise our network containing  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges, respectively, as shown in figure  <dig>  detailed network examination is available through the network description files , also providing external links to genbank, uniprot, and pubmed for all edges and nodes.

available tools for automatic text mining decide schematically, e.g., by pre-built rules like co-occurrence of gene names and interaction verbs or pattern matching, whereas a human expert is able to integrate unanticipated types of information and to decide whether the paper confirms the investigated situation. however, we used the tools bibliosphere  <cit>  and pathway studio  <cit>  in order to verify completeness and consistency of the assembled network .

boolean functions
due to its capability for displaying dynamic dependencies between individual parameters, a boolean network is more specific than the graphical network in figure  <dig>  which summarises isolated literature facts. in order to decide about the connectives or/and, which represent causally determined relations between different genes, cellular signalling processes were also considered.

in the case of a known transcriptional activation of any gene by the stimuli tnfα or tgfβ <dig> via a specific tf, this activation was represented in the network using the term gene.out = stimulus and tf. without such evidence, these influences were connected by gene.out = stimulus or tf. since it is well known that the so-called smad pathway is activated by tgfβ <dig> but not influenced by tnfα  <cit> , we used the and connection for smad3/ <dig> and tgfβ <dig>  even if there was no explicit literature evidence for an impact of tgfβ <dig> onto the respective gene.

another example for setting up the functions is the integration of:  the known auto-regulatory transcriptional activation of jun by tnfα via jun, and  the activation of jun via smad <dig>  into the single boolean function  <dig> : jun.out =  or . based on the illustrated principles, the boolean functions characterising formation and remodelling of the ecm were generated .

gene expression time courses following tgfβ <dig> and tnfα stimulation
we analysed gene expression changes of sfb from patients with ra  or oa  following tgfβ <dig> and tnfα stimulation . due to the strong stimuli, both groups of cells reacted in an almost identical way, and we did not differentiate among them. in another study, for example, oa cells were considered to be a disease control group  <cit> .

 <dig> erythrocyte sedimentation rate

 <dig> c-reactive protein, normal range: <  <dig> mg/l

 <dig> american rheumatism association 

 <dig> methotrexate

 <dig> non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

following pre-processing of the microarray data gained from u <dig> plus  <dig>  arrays, we extracted the data for probe sets related to our genes of interest . the data are available in the geo database . for the following analyses we excluded values which exceeded the reliability threshold of p ≤  <dig>  for any patient at any time point . in figure  <dig>  some selected examples for the influence of tgfβ <dig> and on gene expression are presented. the time courses of col1a <dig> and junb expression are shown to illustrate the tgfβ <dig> response in sfb, and the tnfα response is illustrated by nfkb <dig> and mmp <dig> expression. smad <dig> expression data are also included for both treatments. the data and the respective diagrams for all genes and both treatments can be found in additional file  <dig> 

for comparative purposes, we also analysed public data from the geo database, first, tgfβ <dig> treated murine embryonic fibroblasts  and second, tnfα stimulation of endothelial cells . following prolonged tgfβ <dig> treatment in murine cells, col1a <dig>  jun, and timp <dig> gene expression increased, whereas fos decreased. in contrast, fos, jun, and junb expression in hela cells rapidly increased following tnfα stimulation. unfortunately, no data about the protease genes were available in this dataset . even though cell type, experimental design and duration of treatment differ from our experiments, they reflect the two general trends: a positive effect on ecm formation by tgfβ <dig> and a degradative influence on ecm by tnfα , which is consistent with our data. however, the evaluation of the complete data sets revealed discrepancies between the expected expression profile of individual genes and their time courses following stimulation in the experiment.

data discretisation
we developed a data discretisation method which appropriately captures biologically relevant differences in gene expression levels. the individual time profiles for each gene were separately discretised to the values 0or  <dig> by k-means clustering  <cit> , a method which is often applied for gene expression time series. no improvements were observed when applying ward's hierarchical clustering  <cit>  or single linkage clustering as proposed in  <cit>  . we introduced several supplementary criteria , e.g., the values of a time series were all discretised to the constant value  <dig> or  <dig>  if the differences of all log <dig> values  were less than  <dig>  <cit> . for the discretised data see additional file  <dig> 

boolean functions adapted to the data
simulations were generated using an asynchronous update scheme, assuming time intervals – approximately equal to  <dig> h time steps – as follows: transcription  <dig> , translation:  <dig>  rna lifespan:  <dig>  and protein lifespan:  <dig>  the boolean functions generated the transcriptional states according to the functional influence of proteins ; translation and mrna/protein degradation were computed from this output state according to the predefined intervals .

as starting conditions of the simulations we chose the discretised initial states derived from our experimental data. an additional initial state was introduced in which solely the transcription factors were set to on, which enables the model system to respond to the external stimulators tnfα or tgfβ <dig> immediately. the simulations were performed over twelve time steps; however, we did not aim at an exact correspondence to the experimental observation time of twelve hours, but tried to adjust the simulated time courses to qualitative features such as early, intermediate or late up-regulation. improving the boolean functions accordingly, the initially applied literature-based information was completed by:  valid and specific experimental information;  knowledge and experience of biological experts; and  in some cases, a more focused and precise literature query . for a comparison of the discretised observed time series and the final simulations see the additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  we developed several biologically interesting and plausible data-independent hypotheses, for example, we modelled the regulation of smad3/smad <dig> effects by a protein-protein interaction with smad <dig> 

the resulting optimised boolean network with the revised boolean functions  represents an enhanced ecm model, roughly matching the given biological conditions and extensively exceeding the present possibilities of automatic methods such as text mining, symbolic computation or machine learning. considering the additional information available, we accepted these biologically reasonable changes:

 <dig>  in the case of tnfα  stimulation, the production and secretion of tgfβ <dig>  by sfb should not contradict the influence of the abundant stimulating protein tnfα . in these cases  we removed tgfb <dig>  and  from the boolean function term. this adjustment did not always change the simulation result, since, for example, tnf was always off following tgfβ <dig> stimulation  affected:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 14).

 <dig>  down-regulation of gene expression is an essential biological principle. for that reason we had to introduce a time-limited inactivation mechanism which could not be derived from the literature because information regarding down-regulatory mechanisms is very restricted. moreover, complex and variable mechanisms were hard to model, e.g., jun down-regulation which is driven by:  inactivation of the tf protein itself;  a general shift in the composition of the tf ap- <dig>  resulting in a reduced amount of tf enhancing jun transcription; and  binding/inactivation of jun by other proteins. therefore, a time-limited mrna inactivation was introduced for jun, junb, fos, and ets <dig>  accordingly, an inactivating rule was created: if these tfs are expressed at t>  <dig>  they will be set to off at t+ <dig> and afterwards . in addition, at that step we included an inhibition of tgfb1/smad <dig> signalling-based target gene expression by integrating a smad4-inhibiting signal  guaranteeing the subsequent inactivation of tgfβ1-related gene expression . jund is constitutively expressed at an intermediate level, which is consistent with geo  and our own data, as well as with the literature  <cit> . for nfkb <dig> transcription, an inhibitory effect was not implemented, since the activity of nf-κb at the protein level is controlled by interaction with several ikb proteins  <cit>  which were not included in our ecm network model.

 <dig>  smad <dig> induction is not dependent on tgfβ <dig> stimulation, because it is constitutively expressed . however, without tgfβ1-mediated phosphorylation, smad <dig> is not activated at the protein level and shows no transcriptional activity, even though constitutively expressed. therefore, we amended the term smad <dig> to tgf and smad <dig> in order to represent the necessity of tgfβ <dig> for smad <dig> activation .

 <dig>  we considered the relation ets <dig> and nfkb <dig> for the target genes  <cit>  instead of assuming alternative pathways by ets <dig> or nfkb <dig> because regulation by nf-κb seems to be dependent on ets <dig>  and the mmps, for example, require both factors  <cit>  .

 <dig>  since the inhibition of jund expression by fos is only observed in the case of a concomitant jund-based positive feedback, the inhibitory effect of fos has been restricted to this case  <cit>  .

 <dig>  since a tf should not necessarily be required for its own expression , in the case of jund  the and connection was changed to or. the revision of this function prevents the absence of jund expression following tgfβ <dig> stimulation .

 <dig>  concerning the regulation of mmp <dig> expression by fos, there were contradictory findings in the literature  <cit> . we decided for an inhibitory influence of fos following tgfβ <dig> stimulation, because otherwise mmp <dig> would have been permanently down-regulated by tgfβ <dig> during the simulation .

 <dig>  the boolean function mmp <dig> out =  or tgfb <dig> was in obvious contradiction to the data of the present study, thus, the term or tgfb <dig> was deleted. the same was done for the mmp <dig> function .

 <dig>  in the case of nfkb <dig>  the absence of tnfα stimulation had no decisive influence . for that reason, we changed nfkb <dig> out = tnf and  to nfkb <dig> out = tnf or ets <dig> or nfkb <dig> .

 <dig>  however, concerning the expression of tnf itself, the necessity of a positive feedback could explain its complete absence following tgfβ <dig> stimulation. on the other hand, tnf was expressed at some time points following commonly assumed that fibroblasts do not express tnf .

in summary, we adjusted the set of bf obtained by adaptation to the gene expression data measured under two experimental conditions , in order to create an appropriate set of bf representing the existing knowledge about naturally occurring interrelationships as accurately as possible.

computing temporal rules by attribute exploration
for each stimulus, the observed and the  simulated time series were translated and merged into a single formal context, the basic tabular data structures of fca . states are defined by the value on or off for each gene, and transitions were computed by linking an occurring input state to an arbitrary future  state of the simulation or observation. the set of all these transitions  was analysed by the automatic, noninteractive version of the attribute exploration algorithm, which computes a minimal and complete knowledge base , from which all implications of a given formal context can be derived  <cit> .

the implications of the stem base are temporal rules expressing hypotheses about attributes of states  or system dynamics, which are supported by pre-existing knowledge and by the analysed data. since an implication holds for the transitions between all temporally related states, a rule such as gene <dig> in.on → gene <dig> out.on means: if gene <dig> is expressed, gene <dig> always will be up-regulated in the future, at all subsequent observation time points, and simulation steps. due to this semantics, the implications neither depend on the correspondence of a simulation time step to a specific observation interval, nor on prior knowledge about time periods of direct or indirect transcriptional effects. within the large knowledge bases for tnfα  and tgfβ <dig>  stimulation, the most frequent and simple temporal rules were considered and analysed for dependencies between stimuli, induced tfs, and their target genes.

results of the attribute exploration
stimulation with tnfα
regarding stimulation with tnfα, a coordinated down-regulation with of the two tf smad <dig>  and ets <dig> emerges, as indicated by the rules  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . for example, rule 186:


                     <90> col1a <dig> out.off, est <dig> out.off → smad <dig> out.off
                  

has the meaning: in all simulated and observed states characterised by the absence of col1a <dig> and ets <dig>  smad <dig> is also off. <90> stands for the support of the rule, i.e., the number of transitions  that actually have the attributes of the premise. rules  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> indicate: if the tnfα-dependent genes are not induced , then simultaneously the expression of tgfβ1-dependent genes is enabled . this suggests that tnfα and tgfβ <dig> may act as antagonists in sfb, as described in  <cit> .

the expression of nfkb <dig>  which is also induced by tnfα, proceeds conversely to that of ets <dig> and smad <dig>  reflecting the different targets of nf-κb and smad <dig>  the antagonistic pattern of nfkb <dig> and smad <dig> appears indirectly in rule  <dig>  where the two genes show up in the premise of a rule with high support:


                     <150>  nfkb <dig> out.on, smad <dig> out.off → est <dig> out.off
                  

regarding this rule, it is interesting that ets <dig> always acts in the same direction as nf-κb, according to the network derived from the literature . in the adapted network , we assumed a necessary cooperation  for the positive regulation of ets <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  and tnf, as well as for the inhibition of col1a <dig> and col1a <dig>  thus, rule  <dig> further suggests that the coordinated action of nf-κb and ets <dig> is turned off in states which are characterised by supplementary conditions as smad <dig> out.off.

the generated rules adequately reflect the major influence of the tf ap- <dig> in the system: the expression of prominent targets, such as col1a <dig>  mmp <dig>  and mmp <dig>  depends on jun  and/or fos , with jun as the key player. these rules connect input and output states and thus their semantics is directly related to dynamics, as seen in rule 211:


                     <87> tgfb <dig> in.on, timp <dig> in.on, ets <dig> in.on, jun.in.on → mmp <dig> out.on
                  

making this strong statement: if ets <dig> and jun are on, mmp <dig> will always be up-regulated in the future .

sometimes, mmp <dig> is expressed simultaneously or before ets <dig> and jun. in the simulation, mmp <dig> was always on in the output state and from time point  <dig> h in the data. an exception can be found for the experimental results from oa sample oa <dig> , where mmp <dig> is off after  <dig> h. this is the reason for the computation of the auxiliary conditions tgfb <dig> in.on and timp <dig> in.onin rule  <dig> 

concerning the regulation of target genes, the expression of mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  and mmp <dig> is co-regulated , while mmp <dig> is expressed independently . there is a contradiction between the simulation and the data: in the observed experimental time series, mmp <dig> is always off, whereas the boolean network predicts an up-regulation similar to mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  this unexpected absence of predicted mmp <dig> expression may be an indication for a more complex regulation of mmp <dig> transcription, exceeding the already known regulatory interrelations. therefore, the mmp <dig> promoter and further enhancer/repressor sequences should be targeted for a more pronounced structural and functional analysis. for mmp <dig>  the simulation and the experimental data are in good agreement: the gene is off in most, but not all states. however, since the expression of mmp <dig> by fb is discussed controversially in the literature , the calculated expression of mmp <dig> by fibroblasts – at least at a limited number of time points – supports the majority of studies, reporting detectable mmp <dig> mrna amounts in fb.

several rules unanimously indicate the co-expression of the ecm-forming genes col1a <dig> and col1a <dig> , but contradictory rules occur concerning their expression profile in comparison to the mmps. col1a <dig> and col1a <dig> seem to be co-expressed with mmp <dig> , for col1a <dig>  however, a certain co-expression with mmp <dig> is calculated as well , which conflicts with the opposing expression of mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> . therefore, the expression of collagens does often, but not necessarily always correlate with the expression of mmps. this reflects the imbalance between mmp-dependent destruction and collagen-driven regeneration/fibrosis of ecm in the joints in inflammatory ra.

the calculated knowledge base also contains a further unexpected correlation. according to rule 166:


                     <94> fos.in.off, timp <dig> in.on, smad <dig> out.off → tgfb <dig> in.on, mmp <dig> out.on, tgfb <dig> out.on
                  

and rule  <dig>  the expression of mmp <dig> may also be induced in the absence of fos , indicating that the regulation of mmp <dig> does not predominantly depend on fos as proposed in the literature  <cit> . this result may point to the influence of other tfs, e.g., nf-κb, ets <dig>  or ap- <dig> complexes containing jun, which may indeed be able to induce target gene expression in the absence of fos.

stimulation with tgfβ1
for the stimulation with tgfβ <dig>  we had a total number of  <dig> transitions. the smads play a major role for the expression of tgfβ1-dependent target genes, as reflected by various classes of rules containing smad <dig> and/or smad <dig> . for example, smad <dig> can be involved in the expression of col1a <dig>  see rule  <dig> :


                    <239> ets <dig> out.off → smad <dig> in.on, col1a <dig> out.on, smad <dig> out.on
                  

this also suggests an antagonistic behaviour of ets <dig> and smad4: if ets <dig> was off, then smad <dig> was on, as well as in all previous states. rules  <dig> and  <dig> suggest a dependency of mmp <dig> on smad <dig>  however, this seems to be one amongst many other influences , since smad <dig> was permanently on during simulation and experimental stimulation with tgfβ <dig> .

the expression of mmp <dig> is neither induced by smad <dig>  nor by any other tf, indicating that mmp <dig> is not influenced by tgfβ <dig>  the fact that tgfβ <dig> obviously does not induce mmp <dig>  agrees with findings reported previously  <cit>  and represents a clear contrast to the mmp expression profiles following tnfα stimulation.

a further case of an antagonistic expression pattern was calculated for mmps and col1a <dig> , for example, in rule 54:


                     <170> smad <dig> in.on, mmp <dig> out.off, mmp <dig> out.off, mmp <dig> out.off, ... → col1a <dig> out.on
                  

antagonistic expression profiles also can be observed for smad <dig> and other tfs, e.g., jun and junb  or ets <dig> . the variety of tf combinations found, even following the same stimulus, exceeds the possibilities of conventional tf studies because stimulation experiments are generally restricted to a selected set of readout parameters  which are not able to reflect the multiplicity of different effects in the cell.

following stimulation with tgfβ <dig>  interestingly col1a <dig> appears to be constitutively expressed since its status is always calculated as on . therefore, for the formation of collagen i, which contains col1a <dig> and col1a <dig> chains, col1a <dig> expression seems to be the critical switch.

tgfβ <dig> versus tnfα effects
the calculated results impressively illustrate that tgfβ <dig> and tnfα stimulation are mediated via separate signal transduction pathways, leading to the expression and activation of different tfs. in general, ets <dig> and nfkb <dig> are induced predominantly by tnfα, whereas smad expression depends on tgfβ <dig> . jun and fos, however, strikingly respond to both stimuli. this defined pattern results in the expression of target genes with opposing roles. tgfβ <dig> positively regulates the enhanced formation of ecm components, whereas tnfα is strongly involved in the expression of ecm-degrading enzymes. this was the main reason for a discriminative revision of the bf for tnfα and tgfβ <dig> . six bf were found to be differently adjusted , which concern either the key players for ecm destruction , ecm formation  or important regulatory genes . this may indicate that the differential effects on ecm induced by tnfα or tgfβ <dig> are mainly mediated via ets <dig> , nfkb <dig> , or smad <dig>  identifying ets1- and nfkb1-associated pathways as the major tnfα-induced pro-inflammatory/pro-destructive signalling modules in rheumatic diseases, whereas tgfβ1-driven and smad7-related signalling appear to be prominently involved in fibrosis.

querying the knowledge base
the minimal rule set gave many new insights, and further queries can be addressed by accessing the tnfα and tgfβ <dig> knowledge bases in one of two ways:  the excel file containing the transition rules for structured searches within the rule sets ; and  the stem base in prolog format for queries concerning logically implied rules .

CONCLUSIONS
the analyses in the present study were based on literature data valid for healthy human sfb. these findings were fine-tuned and adapted to gene expression time course data triggered by tgfβ <dig> and tnfα in sfb from ra and oa patients. both the assembly of previous knowledge and the adaptation of the boolean functions gave detailed insight into disease-related regulatory processes. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first dynamical model of ecm formation and degradation by human sfb.

one of the strengths of the fca method applied here is its ability to give a complete, but minimal representation of observed or simulated data. this complete overview of temporal rules enabled us to find new relationships. the most unexpected result is the expression of tnf at some time points following tnfα stimulation, whereas it is commonly assumed that sfb do not express tnf  <cit> . similarly, our experimental data as well as our simulation results support mmp <dig> expression in sfb thus corroborating the majority of the literature regarding expression of this protease  <cit> . here, it is important to note that a contamination of our sfb population with macrophages  can be excluded due to the sfb isolation protocol, resulting in a pure sfb population  <cit> . we also found that mmp <dig> was induced in the absence of fos after tnfα stimulation, whereas mmp <dig> was not expressed despite of reports about its induction by nf-κb, jun, or fos. these facts indicate that the regulation of mmp and tnfα expression may be more diverse than presently known and that it still represents a relevant research target to elucidate the role of sfb in the pathophysiology of rheumatic diseases.

concerning the formation of collagen type i fibres by col1a <dig> and col1a <dig> proteins following the stimulation with tgfβ <dig>  a constitutive expression of col1a <dig> was calculated. based on these data, col1a <dig> has to be regarded as the critical switch for the formation of collagen i. in contrast, the corresponding literature generally postulates a co-regulation of both genes, due to similarities in their promoters  <cit> . this difference suggests that the regulation of col1a <dig> and col1a <dig> may not have been fully elucidated so far possibly pointing at col1a <dig> as a more promising target for the exploration of fibrosis.

our analyses also show that tnfα-induced signalling predominantly results in the activation of ets <dig> and nfkb <dig>  whereas tgfβ1-related signal transduction is ultimately mediated via proteins of the smad family. defined intervention addressing these signalling modules, alone or in combination with established therapies targeting tnfα , may therefore improve the efficiency and outcome of current anti-rheumatic therapy  <cit> . alternatively, the present results may be employed to define subpopulations of ra patients in characteristic phases of ra  and tailor anti-rheumatic treatment to the particular needs of the respective phase  <cit> .

both the complexity of even relatively small networks such as our ecm network and the completeness of the attribute exploration algorithm led to a large number of temporal rules. however, high support of a rule  can be used as an indicator for the most meaningful hypotheses about co-regulation, mutual exclusion, and/or temporal dependencies not only between single genes, but between small sets of  genes. the fidelity of our rules was reinforced by the comparison of simulated and observed time series data, first manually, then automatically by the attribute exploration algorithm.

combining two well-developed algebraic, discrete and logical methods  it was possible to include human expert knowledge in all different phases , with the exception of the challenging data discretisation step. on the one hand, data discretisation is an important tool to filter out noise and to reduce complexity, but on the other hand it inevitably causes loss of information  <cit> . carefully evaluating the method, we tried to keep as much important information as possible. in special cases, we consulted the original data again. a recently developed fca-based method avoids predefined discretisation but computes an ordered set of "interval pattern structures" depending on the observed values  <cit> . thus, a data set may be described without loss of information or by means of any desired granularity.

additional method optimisations comprise strengthening the expert role on the one hand and up-scaling the network to medium size by supplementary automatisation on the other. especially for a small set of interesting genes an interactive attribute exploration is feasible to fortify the human expert. using this procedure for the knowledge base construction, single rules can be validated manually or by a supporting computer program, or even new experiments can be suggested. whereas we applied a strong validation criterion requiring rules to hold for all simulated and observed transitions, the expert could also reject rules below a threshold of support and confidence in the observed context, potentially reducing noise or eliminating measurement errors.

in order to enhance computational efficiency, methods of rule selection could be integrated into the algorithm, based on association rule mining and "iceberg concept lattices"  derived from a transition context as in table 6)  <cit> . manual adaptation of the network may be replaced by algorithms of network inference  <cit> .

in summary, the adapted boolean network model reported here for the simulation of ecm formation and degradation in rheumatic diseases may represent a powerful tool aiding computational analyses of disease-related ecm remodelling and supporting a precise design of further experiments.
