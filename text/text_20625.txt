BACKGROUND
the diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerve. the well-studied motor innervation of the diaphragm by the phrenic nerve arises from motor neurons in the ventral horn of the cervical spinal cord . the phrenic nerve motor innervation originates from c <dig> to c <dig> spinal segments in the cat. the diaphragm also has afferent innervation carried to the central nervous system by the phrenic nerve. there are both myelinated and non-myelinated afferents in the diaphragm. the myelinated afferents have conduction velocities consistent with group ia, ib and ii afferents. the diaphragm has relatively few group ia muscle spindles but a relatively large percentage of group ib golgi tendon organs . group ii mechanoreceptors have also been reported . thus, the diaphragm has innervation with afferents that provide muscle mechanical feedback to the cns via the phrenic nerve. however, physiological evidence of phrenic afferent activation of the spinal cord dorsal horn is lacking.

the role of phrenic afferents in the regulation of diaphragm function has been studied with early observations suggesting that phrenic afferents in the diaphragm are not involved in controlling the respiratory muscle activity . however, electrical and mechanical stimulation of phrenic afferents are reported to activate thalamic neurons  and elicit neural activity in the cat somatosensory cortex . in addition, zechman et al  reported a correlation of transdiaphragmatic pressure  and the perception of inspiratory loads. knafelc and davenport reported that increased pdi correlated with the amplitude of the respiratory related evoked potential recorded from the human somatosensory cortex. thus, there appears to be a projection of diaphragmatic afferents to the cns and mechanical changes in the diaphragm correlate with somatosensory activation of the cerebral cortex. however, pna activation of spinal sensory pathway remains unknown.

anatomical studies have found that phrenic nerve afferents  terminate in the dorsal horn lamina i-iv of c <dig> and c <dig> spinal cord in rat . in a brief report, larnicol et al  reported immunoflourescent evidence of dorsal root entry of phrenic nerve afferents in the dorsal horn of the cervical spinal cord. gill et al  also demonstrated phrenic motorneuron activities were elicited by segmental phrenic nerve afferents. corda et al  demonstrated that the cervical spinal dorsal rootlets contain diaphragmatic mechanoreceptors, including muscle spindles and golgi tendon organs. electrophysiological studies have confirmed that group i and group ii phrenic nerve afferents project to lateral reticular nucleus , external cuneate nucleus , and both ventral and dorsal respiratory-related areas of brainstem . moreover, in anesthetized cats, short-latency responses have been recorded in the thalamus  and somatosensory cortex  after electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve afferents and mechanical probing of the diaphragm. if diaphragmatic proprioceptors project to higher somatosensory brain centers via pathways similar to group ia and group ib receptors , then phrenic afferents should enter the spinal cord ipsilaterally through the dorsal roots of the cervical spinal segments, terminate on dorsal horn neurons, dorsal horn neurons should then project centrally via the dorsal columns to the brainstem and then project to the somatosensory cortex and other supraspinal structures. if this is the phrenic afferent pathway to the somatosensory cortex, then electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve will stimulate phrenic afferents and activate dorsal horn neurons. however, the activation of the cervical dorsal horn by stimulation of phrenic afferents has not been reported.

one method to investigate dorsal horn neuronal activation by afferent stimulation is recording the cord dorsum potential  . simultaneous stimulation of peripheral afferents activates groups of dorsal horn neurons. the activation of a group of neurons produces a dipole referenced to the surface of the spinal cord. this dipole is the result of a change in polarity of the activated neurons creating a current flow with the cord surface. thus, neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord generate a field potential when an afferent volley arrives. these negative voltage evoked potentials generated from the dorsal horn neurons of the spinal cord by stimulation of peripheral nerves have been extensively studied for limb afferents . the cdp was first discovered and described by grasser and graham  as they recorded complex evoked potentials from the surface of the spinal cord. this potential appeared to be largest in the dorsal horn grey matter and is generated by a synchronous activation of a population of dorsal horn neurons that respond to stimulation of low-threshold cutaneous afferents.

stimulation of nerve afferents at an intensity that activates only group i muscle afferents has been shown to evoke a dorsal cord field potential consisting of a triphasic spike, a short duration negative wave, and a positive wave. activation of group ii muscle afferent fibers resulted in a second short duration negative component of the cdp . when a nerve is stimulated sufficiently distal to the spinal cord, the depolarization of the dorsal horn neurons occurs sequentially as a function of the arrival of afferents with different conduction velocities. thus, it has been shown that the triphasic spike of the cdp occurs because of a separation of activation due to the arrival of group ia, group ib and group ii afferents. the different peak latencies allow for the determination of different populations of activated afferents.

we reasoned that, if the phrenic nerve contains group ia, group ib and group ii afferents, then stimulating the phrenic nerve as far distal from the spinal cord as possible  would elicit multiple cdp peaks. in addition, we hypothesized that if phrenic nerve afferents enter a cervical segment of the spinal cord, then stimulating pna will elicit a cdp in that segment. however, the cdp for phrenic nerve afferents has never been reported. therefore, recording the phrenic afferent cdp was hypothesized to provide evidence of segmental dorsal horn activation by phrenic afferents. this study recorded the cdp from c <dig> to c <dig> elicited by stimulating pna to determine the cervical spinal segmental distribution of pna elicited cpd, to characterize cdp latencies and infer the populations of pna eliciting the cdp in cats.

RESULTS
in all cats, electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve elicited cdp's recorded at the dorsal surface of c <dig> to c <dig> cervical spinal segments, and at rostral, middle and caudal locations within each spinal segment. no cdp was observed in the c <dig> spinal segment. a primary cdp elicited by stimulation of pna was observed and recorded in dorsal surface of c <dig> to c <dig> cervical spinal segments . the n <dig> cdp was recorded in the c <dig> to c <dig> spinal segments; whereas three cdp peaks  were identified only in the c <dig> and c <dig> spinal segments . the distributions of the onset latencies and peak amplitudes of individual cervical spinal cord segments are summarized in  and , respectively. the averaged n <dig> peak latency was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms for all cervical spinal segments. the averaged n <dig> peak latency was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms and the averaged n <dig> peak latency was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms in the c <dig> and c <dig> segments. the averaged conduction velocity was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  m/sec for the n <dig> peak,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  m/sec for the n <dig> peak and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  m/sec for the n <dig> peak. there was a significant difference between the latencies for n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> peaks . the average n <dig> peak amplitude was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μv in the c <dig> segment and significantly less than the n <dig> peak amplitude for c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> spinal segments . the average n <dig> peak amplitude was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μv in the c <dig> segment and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μv in the c <dig> segment and not significantly different. the average n <dig> amplitude was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μv in the c <dig> segment and significantly less than c <dig> and c <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> peaks were only observed in the c <dig> and c <dig> spinal segments and the averaged n <dig> peak amplitude was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μv in the c <dig> segment and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μv in the c <dig> segment. the averaged n <dig> peak amplitude was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μv in the c <dig> segment and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μv in the c <dig> segment. the amplitudes of the cdp peaks were significantly different between the n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> peaks .

discussion
neural activity was elicited by stimulation of pna in c <dig> to c <dig> dorsal cervical spinal cord segments in the present study. the electrical stimulation of pna served the important purpose of demonstrating the existence and locations of pna- elicited cdp in c <dig> to c <dig> segments of the cat cervical spinal cord. this stimulation of pna was initially observed by one or three negative peaks depending on different segments recorded. the presence of the three negative peaks in c <dig> and c <dig> spinal segments appears to be due primarily to the spinal input from different groups of pna. the presence of only the n <dig> peak in c <dig> and c <dig> demonstrates a different number of afferent populations between the cervical spinal segments that contribute to the cat phrenic nerve.

central projections of pna
cdp recordings are evidence of the activation of neurons in the dorsal horn of the cervical spinal cord by pna. neural activity in the dorsal surface of the cervical spinal cord elicited by pna found in this study is consistent with the previous studies of limb muscle afferents . these results are consistent with pna entering the cervical spinal cord, projecting to the dorsal horn, which then relays pna to the brainstem, and projects phrenic afferent information to the somatosensory cortex via a thalamocortical pathway . the function of this putative pathway could be related to the proprioceptive control of respiratory muscles and respiratory movement control originating in the motor cortex . davenport et al  proposed that the pna projection to the postcruciate region of the cerebral cortex may play a role in higher brain center control of the respiratory pump. the sensory projection sites of the pna were localized in area 3a and 3b of the sensorimotor cortex in cats. however, the pna sensory sites in the cortex are not co-localized with motor sites. this means that the cortical regions receiving the sensory information from pna are separated from the cortical regions of motor output to the phrenic spinal motor neurons. recordings of evoked potentials using phrenic nerve stimulation provide a unique method for studying the potential pathways for cortical integration of respiratory afferent information and the projections of pna to the central nervous system . although the pna projection pathways to the cerebral cortex remain unknown, the present study supports a dorsal column mediated pathway that likely involves a multisynaptic thalamic relayed projection . it has been shown in the previous studies  that c-fiber afferents have much higher threshold and longer latency for pna stimulation than group ia, ib and group ii afferents. conduction velocities for c-fibers are less than  <dig> m/s. with the length of the phrenic nerve for these cats, the latency for a c-fiber elicited peak of the cdp would be approximately  <dig> ms, longer than the  <dig> ms sampling time used for recording the post-stimulus epochs in this study. in addition, the use of  <dig>  ms stimulus pulse width does not elicit c-fiber action potentials. therefore, it is unlikely that c fiber afferents contributed to the cdp in this experiment.

pna elicited cdp
results of this study provide evidence that a spinal cdp was elicited by phrenic nerve afferents input to the dorsal horn of the cat cervical spinal cord. this result is consistent with the report from cuddon et al  that the cdp is a measurement of spinal segmental interneurons and dorsal horn cell function. the rationale behind the cdp measurement as an assessment of sensory nerve afferent and dorsal horn neuronal functions is the phases of the cdp reflect the different population of afferent fibers activating dorsal horn neurons . the large negative peak  represents the interneuronal depolarization of spinal dorsal horn neurons elicited by large myelinated sensory afferents . the activation of a n <dig> peak in c <dig> to c <dig> spinal segments suggests a broadly distributed input to the spinal cord from phrenic group i afferents . a n <dig> peak was not recorded in the c <dig> spinal segment. there is a second negative peak  that represents the depolarization of spinal dorsal horn neurons by slower conducting myelinated sensory afferents . a third negative peak  most likely represents the depolarization of spinal dorsal horn neurons elicited by small myelinated sensory afferents . the presence of n <dig> and n <dig> in the c <dig> and c <dig> spinal segments suggests a preferential input of group ii and group iii afferents into these specific spinal segments.

limb group ia, ib and ii have been shown to project to somatosensory cortex of cat via a dorsal column pathway . corda et al  reported group ia, ib and ii afferents in the phrenic nerve. it is very likely that pna have a projection similar to limb proprioceptors. this conjecture is supported in the present study by the cdp elicited in the dorsal surface of cervical spinal cord by stimulation of pna which is consistent with a dorsal column central neural projection pathway. it is therefore concluded that group ia, group ib, group ii and possibly group iii afferents elicit a cdp that is consistent with an ascending phrenic sensory pathway via the dorsal column and the dorsolateral funiculus  of the cervical spinal cord.

somatosensory pna pathway
cortical projection of pna has been shown in both cortical evoked potentials  and retrograde fluorescent  studies. activation of the somatosensory cortex in cats after electrical stimulation of the contralateral phrenic nerve  and intercostals muscles  has been reported by this laboratory. one role of the somatosensory projections from phrenic nerve afferents may be to provide the sensory feedback to the cerebral cortex of respiratory pump function. the diaphragm, the intercostal muscles and accessory muscles of respiration provide the inspiratory pumping force for ventilation. stimulation of pna has been shown in humans to elicit somatosensory cortical evoked potentials . inspiratory occlusion produces a maximal load on the pumping action of the respiratory muscle and has been reported to elicit somatosensory respiratory related evoked potential  in humans  and lambs . knafelc and davenport reported a correlation between rrep amplitude and the magnitude of the increase in pdi when graded inspiratory resistive loads were applied in humans. these reports suggest that mechanical loading of the respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm, can elicit somatosensory cortical neural activity. although the afferents mediating these evoked potentials are unknown, it is likely that respiratory muscle afferents are one population of receptors that mediate these responses. the results presented in the present study are therefore consistent with the hypothesized role of pna in the somatosensation of inspiratory loads. thus, neurons in dorsal spinal cord activated by stimulation of pna may be related to respiratory muscle proprioception, similar to what has been found in other muscle systems.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present study recorded a spinal cdp elicited by the activation of phrenic nerve afferents. the pna project to dorsal horn neurons in the cervical spinal cord from c <dig> to c <dig> indicating these segments can function as a relay for the conduction of proprioceptive information from the diaphragm to the higher brain centers in cats. the first peak, n <dig>  conduction velocity is consistent with large myelinated afferent activation, group ia and group ib. these pna enter all the spinal segments that contribute to the phrenic nerve in cats. the second peak conduction velocity is consistent with myelinated afferents, group ib and large group ii. the third peak conduction velocity is consistent with myelinated afferents, group iii. the second and third peaks of the cdp were observed only in the primary spinal origin  of the cat phrenic nerve. the cdp potentials described in this study reflect the first relay by the dorsal spinal cord of the projection of myelinated pna to the higher brain centers in cats. therefore, the results of this study support the hypothesis that pna activation of neurons in the dorsal cervical spinal cord may be involved in the central projection of respiratory muscle afferent information.
