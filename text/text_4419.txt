BACKGROUND
prevention of catastrophic crop loss to plant pathogens is most often achieved through the incorporation of resistance genetics into commercial cultivars. host responses to plant pathogens are broadly divided into two categories; basal defense responses induced by generic pathogen signals or elicitors called “pathogen-associated molecular patterns” , resulting in mild defense responses collectively known as ‘pamp triggered immunity’  and r gene mediated ‘effector triggered immunity’  in which race-specific pathogen avirulence  proteins trigger robust defense mechanisms including hypersensitive response  leading to host cell death at the site of infection  <cit> . when studying foliar plant pathogens, the hr response of race-specific r genes often provides a visual phenotype, indicating an incompatible interaction and allowing for the determination of pathogen virulence. this distinction is used to separate specific r gene interactions from quantitative resistance which can provide effective ‘adult plant resistance’  within a crop variety through the cumulative action of multiple resistance loci. apr is usually measured at the end of the growing season in field trials.

apr is particularly important for combating diseases of brassica napus l.  in which r gene mediated resistance is lacking, such as sclerotinia stem rot   and verticillium wilt   or for diseases where pathogen populations often display a rapid adaptation towards r gene mediated resistance, such as in the case of blackleg disease, caused by the hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen leptosphaeria maculans  <cit> .

avoidance of r gene mediated resistance by l. maculans can occur both rapidly and in a geographically localised fashion when a pathogen population is under heavy selection pressure. a rapid decline in the efficiency of the blackleg r gene rlm <dig> in controlling the disease in europe highlighted the evolutionary potential of the pathogen  <cit> . a high frequency of mutation and deletion of the l. maculans avirulence gene avrlm4- <dig> was reported to occur within a small plot area sown continually to b. napus harbouring rlm <dig>  while virulent pathotypes remained undetectable in samples from the surrounding local pathogen population  <cit> . high rates of infection were observed in some areas of australia in canola varieties carrying the r gene lepr <dig> only three years after first commercial release of the material  <cit> , though this rapid loss of effective resistance may have been aided by pre-exposure to rlm <dig> varieties, as avirulence towards lepr <dig> and rlm <dig> is conferred by the same l. maculans avirulence gene; avrlm <dig>  <cit> .

b. napus cultivars containing only apr usually show no difference in the development of leaf lesions when compared with susceptible cultivars, yet they restrict the development of internal stem infection by the pathogen, resulting in lower levels of crown canker formation  <cit> . this is in contrast to r gene mediated resistance which leads to arrest of l. maculans growth at the site of infection on cotyledons and leaves. when major r gene mediated resistance is avoided by virulent strains within the mixed pathogen population, apr reduces the selection and proliferation of virulent pathotypes in crop residues and the potential for catastrophic crop loss in following seasons .

while r gene mediated resistance can often be detected efficiently and rapidly by observing hypersensitive response after inoculation of b. napus cotyledons with well-characterised l. maculans isolates, assessment of apr is much more difficult. resistance needs to be measured either through field-based studies, or under controlled conditions through infection with single spore-derived l. maculans isolates and assessment of stem infection in plants grown for several months  <cit> . assessment of apr in field-based studies can be difficult considering the complexity of plant-pathogen-environment interactions. populations of l. maculans in most disease nurseries are genetically heterogeneous mixtures arising from sexual recombination and variation of pathotypes should be expected both within a trial site and between trial years. also, variation of host response due to heterozygosity of b. napus lines may be confused for polygenic control of resistance  <cit> . there has also been a widely-held view that blackleg apr is race non-specific  <cit> , based largely on experience of the french variety jet neuf, which provided durable resistance to blackleg disease over many years in europe and was also utilised in early efforts to improve blackleg resistance in australian germplasm  <cit> . however, more recent studies utilising single l. maculans isolates have questioned the “race non-specific” nature of blackleg apr  <cit> .

maintenance of strong apr in canola varieties can most efficiently be achieved through marker-assisted breeding based on the molecular characterisation of quantitative trait loci  associated with resistance  <cit> . the french variety darmor, derived from jet neuf, is the most extensively studied b. napus variety harbouring quantitative resistance to l. maculans. a doubled-haploid  population produced from a cross between darmor-bzh and the susceptible korean cultivar yudal  was utilised to map  <dig> qtl contributing to blackleg resistance, with four of the qtl detected stably across two years of field testing  <cit> . the resistance was further analysed in darmor x samouraï  dh and f <dig> populations, revealing four qtl that were common to both the dy and ds populations  <cit> . near-isogenic lines  were also produced for four darmor qtl; lma <dig>  lma <dig>  lmc <dig> and lmc <dig>  though only lma <dig> was fully validated as having a significant effect on reducing disease severity  <cit> . blackleg apr has also been assessed in several australian varieties, revealing multiple qtl that are potentially common to several australian and french cultivars  <cit> .

little is known about the molecular basis of apr to l. maculans infection in brassica species. while two race-specific genes responsible for eti-mediated blackleg resistance, lepr <dig> and rlm <dig>  have been cloned from b. napus and shown to encode extracellular leucine-rich repeat  receptor-like proteins recognising the l. maculans effectors avrlm <dig> and avrlm <dig>  respectively  <cit> , no genes underpinning blackleg resistance qtl have been identified. infection of b. napus by l. maculans results in attempted physical restriction of the pathogen by the host, via callose deposition, while an increased lignification response has also been reported for apr varieties  <cit> . l. maculans infection triggers induction of the salicylic acid  signalling pathway  <cit>  which plays a critical role in plant defense  <cit> . sa signalling can be triggered in b. napus by purified l. maculans cell wall components  <cit>  and is greatly induced during eti, along with the ethylene signalling pathway and h2o <dig> accumulation  <cit> . however, these studies have all focused on early infection events in the cotyledons of b. napus seedlings; nothing is known about which defense mechanisms may be active against the invading hyphae as they grow asymptomatically through the petiole  <cit>  and stem  <cit> .

in this study we identified several stable blackleg resistance qtl, with resistance alleles derived from ag-castle and av-sapphire, two blackleg-resistant australian b. napus varieties released in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. we used topas/ag-castle  and topas/av-sapphire  dh populations to assess the apr of the varieties over multiple years at two locations, performed both single- and multi-environment qtl mapping and defined the physical locations of the qtl relative to the recently released b. napus darmor-bzh reference genome  <cit> , allowing for the identification of candidate defense-related genes.

RESULTS
population data
field tests were conducted in south eastern australia in disease nurseries located near horsham, victoria and wagga wagga, new south wales . mean survival percentages  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % for the tc population, and  <dig>  to  <dig>  % for the ts population, with s of individual entries  ranging from  <dig> to 100 % in all tests except for ts horsham  <dig>  where the maximum s recorded for a single entry was  <dig>  %. mean internal infection percentages  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % for the tc population and  <dig> to  <dig>  % for the ts population. the minimum ii observed was 4 %  with a maximum ii of 100 % recorded in all tests. for both populations, mean survival was always higher, and mean internal infection was always lower, in tests at the wagga wagga site when compared to the horsham site . heritability was calculated based on total entries in each environment for each scoring metric; survival  and internal infection  and was generally high, producing similar ranges for each metric  .fig.  <dig> location of field trial sites in south eastern australian. dashed box on left indicates highlighted region on right. red dots show location of trial sites, blue dots show major cities. map modified from original image

linkage analysis
while the lack of heterozygosity in the populations showed the lines produced to be true doubled haploids, marker distortion was detected in many regions. 40 % of tc marker bins and  <dig>  % of ts markers showed mild distortion , while 21 % of tc markers and 6 % of ts markers showed severely distorted segregation . the severely affected regions were generally towards the ends of chromosomes; in the tc population they were the upper portions of chromosomes a <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  and the lower portions of a <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  additionally, the entire a <dig> chromosome was uniformly distorted, with all markers favoring the topas parent allele in an approximately 3: <dig> ratio. in the ts population, upper c <dig>  lower a <dig> and all of c <dig> were severely distorted. two draft maps were initially produced for each population; one containing all markers, and a second in which all severely affected marker loci were removed. whole-genome qtl analysis was performed using both draft map versions. no changes to qtl positions were observed between draft maps, nor were significant differences in qtl lod and variance scores, with the exception of the rlm <dig> locus, positioned on a <dig> on the ‘distorted’ tc map and absent from the ‘non-distorted’ map. to accommodate mapping of the a <dig> rlm <dig> resistance locus and its associated qtl in the final analysis, tc a <dig> was resolved independently and added to final tc map. all other distorted markers were removed prior to final map construction. the final tc map consisted of  <dig> marker bins  spanning  <dig>  cm in  <dig> linkage groups  representing all  <dig> b. napus chromosomes. linkage mapping for the ts population produced  <dig> lgs , which were assigned to  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes, with no representation for chromosome c <dig> 

single-environment qtl
permutation tests performed for each scoring metric, survival  and internal infection  percentage, in each environment determined significant lod thresholds between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the tc population and  <dig> – <dig>  for the ts population. analysis of the single-environment data produced multiple qtl exceeding their respective lod thresholds , which were localised to seven chromosomes for the tc population  and five chromosomes of the ts population , and accounting for between  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance . to identify chromosomal regions harbouring ‘stable’ and significant qtl regions, qtl identified from individual environments were only considered significant if they exceeded both the lod threshold for each analysis, based on permutation test  and accounted for >5 % of the variance. after applying these criteria three significant qtl, each with favorable alleles derived from the respective resistance donor parent , were identified in each population. these regions consisted of clustered qtl located on chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig> and c <dig> of ag-castle, and a <dig>  a <dig> and c <dig> of av-sapphire, with the a <dig> and c <dig> qtl regions appearing to be common to both resistance donor parent lines . for the tc larger population , the three clustered qtl regions were represented by qtl detected from all three single-environment analyses , accounting for  <dig>  to  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  to  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  to  <dig>  %  of the phenotypic variance. for the ts population , only the a <dig> qtl region was represented by qtl detected in all four tested environments . the ts a <dig> qtl region was represented by qtl detected in the two 4-block trials  which accounted for  <dig>  to  <dig>  % of the variance in those years. an additional a <dig> qtl  was also detected from the wagga wagga  <dig> trial  though this failed to exceed the lod threshold for significance. the ts c <dig> qtl region was only represented by qtl detected in the two horsham nurseries , though a large portion of the variance was attributed to this region in those tests .table  <dig> clustered single and multi-environment qtl detected in tc and ts populations

multi-environment qtl
multi-environment trait  analysis performed using s and ii data for all environments produced met qtl corresponding to each of the seven chromosomes previously identified from the single-environment analysis, except for tc a <dig> and c <dig>  in addition, multiple low-variance met qtl were detected for the ts population. estimates of the additive genetic  and environmental  components of the multi-environment variance  were used to calculate the narrow-sense heritability  of each met qtl. as doubled-haploid populations were used for the study there was no heterozygosity and thus no dominance component for the variance. h <dig> values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  were determined for the tc qtl, while slightly higher h <dig> values  were determined for qtl in the smaller ts population . multi-environment traits  were considered significant, and the associated chromosomal regions harbouring met qtl were considered to make a stable contribution to resistance, if they accounted for greater than 5 % of the total variance and were attributed a heritability score of  <dig>  or higher. after applying these criteria only met qtl associated with the previously-identified single-environment qtl clusters were retained. the total multi-environment survival  and internal infection  variance explained by the major qtl regions was  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, for the tc population, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, for the ts population .

single-isolate characterisation
each dh line in the tc and ts populations were characterised for the presence or absence of hypersensitive response via cotyledon infection tests, as differential phenotypic reactions were initially observed to the l. maculans isolates wa <dig>  and v <dig> . <dig> . after the phenotypic data was converted to mendelised resistant  and susceptible  scores and incorporated into the genetic maps for each population, the cotyledon resistance loci were determined to localise to chromosome a <dig>  co-segregating with the simple sequence repeat  marker sr <dig> in both cases . as chromosome a <dig> is known to harbour the race-specific blackleg resistance genes rlm <dig>  rlm <dig>  rlm <dig>  rlm <dig> and rlm <dig>  further characterisation of the parental lines with differential l. maculans isolates varying in their reactions to the a <dig> r genes was performed. only isolates avirulent towards rlm <dig> or rlm <dig> produced resistant reactions on ag-castle or av-sapphire, respectively . additional evidence for the presence of rlm <dig> in av-sapphire was produced using the transgenic isolate 3r11: avrlm4- <dig>  which demonstrated the avrlm4- <dig> gene conveys avirulence towards av-sapphire .table  <dig> determination of a <dig> blackleg r genes in ag-castle and av-sapphire

the rlm <dig> locus of the tc population co-segregated with a group of three ssr alleles; sr12294a, sr <dig> and sr2834a , which span a region of  <dig> genes of the b. napus darmor-bzh reference genome  <cit>  on chromosome a <dig> . unfortunately the closest flanking markers to the rlm <dig> cluster were the ssr markers snra <dig> and sr <dig>  both of which match to portions of the genomic sequence which are not currently incorporated into the b. napus chromosome a <dig> model . the next-closest flanking markers, sr12119a  and sr12387b  represent a region spanning approximately  <dig>  mb and  <dig> genes of b. napus chromosome a <dig>  utilising the b. rapa genome sequence  <cit>  we were able to define the smaller snra59-sr <dig> interval as spanning the genes bra <dig> through bra <dig>  on b. rapa a <dig>  and to infer an equivalent b. napus a <dig> interval of not greater than bnaa07g18610d to bnaa07g24890d . this suggested that approximately  <dig> more genes within the b. napus interval were not currently incorporated in the current b. napus a <dig> chromosome build  <cit> .

the mapping of rlm <dig> with the ts population placed the gene between the ssr markers sn2555ra and sn2834a, a region spanning approximately  <dig>  mb and  <dig> genes on chromosome a <dig>  which overlapped the rlm <dig> interval defined in the tc population.

during the phenotypic screening of the mapping populations with single isolates, some intermediate phenotypes  were observed. therefore, to test for qtl affecting the expression of the cotyledon resistance phenotype when challenged with single isolates of l. maculans, the phenotypic data was again analysed, this time as continuous data  rather than the discrete “mendelised” data  analysed previously. as expected, large portions of the variance were associated with each major resistance gene locus . we also detected a second significant qtl for the tc population which accounted for  <dig>  % of the cotyledon phenotypic variance and co-localised with the tc c <dig> qtl cluster .

delineation of qtl loci and identification of candidate genes
the  <dig>  cm map interval containing the tc a <dig> met s and met ii loci was flanked by the markers sn <dig> and sn <dig> , which corresponds to a span of  <dig> b. napus genes . the peak met lod scores for each metric were flanked by the markers sr <dig> and sn <dig> which corresponded to a  <dig> gene interval of the darmor-bzh reference b. napus genome . the ts a <dig> qtl locus was flanked by the markers sr9228a and sn <dig>  representing a span of  <dig> genes , with peak lods for all qtl contained with the  <dig>  cm marker interval sr6202b–sn <dig> , representing a span of  <dig> b. napus genes which also encapsulates the physical interval defined for the tc a <dig> qtl locus.

the tc population produced a cluster of single- and multi-environment qtl on chromosome a <dig>  with peak values for all qtl positioned between  <dig> and 46 cm . the multi-environment analysis defined overlapping met s and met ii qtl contained within a marker interval of  <dig>  cm flanked by the markers sn4513fa and sn12352a. this interval corresponds to a region of  <dig> genes in the darmor-bzh reference genome .

the qtl cluster detected for the ts population on chromosome a <dig> was positioned within the marker interval ss <dig> to sr <dig>  which corresponds to a physical interval of  <dig> genes in the b. napus reference genome . while the peak lod for many of the qtl, including both the met s and met ii qtl, was positioned within the smaller sr6410–sr <dig> marker interval, the physical region could not be refined any further using the b. napus reference genome, as sr <dig> was assigned to the ‘chra09_random’ molecule which is not incorporated into the main a <dig> chromosome build. however, by using the b. rapa chiifu a genome reference sequence  <cit> , we identified homology between sr <dig> and the b. rapa a <dig> gene bra <dig> and used a neighbouring gene  to determine an approximate b. napus physical position for this gene as equivalent to bnaa09g32910d of b. napus. this produced a physical delineation for the a <dig> qtl peak interval of approximately  <dig> genes .

qtl clusters were also detected on chromosome c <dig> in each population, though poor resolution of these linkage groups hampered precise delineation of the support intervals. the ts c <dig> qtl support interval was delimited to a  <dig> gene span of the b. napus genome  between the markers ss <dig> and sn5088f while in the tc population, a b. napus physical interval could not be defined as the upper flanking marker for the tc c <dig> support interval  provide a match to the unincorporated ‘chrun_random’ molecule. we were, however, able to define a syntenic physical interval in the b. oleracea reference genome  <cit>  of approximately 9 mb on c <dig> , which contains  <dig> predicted genes.

delineation of the tc a <dig>  tc a <dig> and ts a <dig> qtl loci produced physical intervals sufficiently small to warrant identification of gene candidates that had potential roles in underpinning pathogen resistance qtl. the tc a <dig> qtl peak lod interval spanned only ten genes, which straddled a cluster of eight genes  with homology to the cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase  genes of a. thaliana chromosome  <dig> . crks are one of the largest super-families of receptor kinases in arabidopsis with  <dig> members  <cit> , several of which have been implicated in plant defense responses . the tc a <dig> and ts a <dig> peak qtl intervals span  <dig> and  <dig> genes within the reference b. napus genome, respectively. within these spans are several potential resistance-related genes including receptor-like proteins, a receptor-like kinase and tir-nb-lrr homologues.

discussion
we describe here the detection and characterisation of highly-stable quantitative resistance loci to the b. napus fungal pathogen l. maculans. through multi-environment analysis we were able to define highly-heritable resistance loci effective in some of the harshest testing conditions in the world and to identify putative resistance-related genes that are located within the physically-defined qtl regions.

in performing the qtl tests over multiple environments we were able to produce estimates of heritability  for each met qtl . traditionally heritability is calculated as a function of the variance within the entire population . while this provides an estimate of the genetic influence on the over-all phenotypic variance, this does not provide information on the environmental variability of individual qtl loci within the population. by calculating h <dig> values for each met qtl we can offer an estimate of how environmental variability will affect the phenotypic variation, particularly when targeting individual qtl loci in breeding programs. we also observed that in the larger tc population , the h <dig> values were consistently higher when met qtl were determined using the survival metric compared to the internal infection metric, though this did not hold true for the smaller ts population . this may be due to the influence of ‘escapes’ in the scoring of the field trials. while significant differences were seen in survival between the ‘susceptible’ topas and ‘resistant’ parental cultivars ag-castle and av-sapphire, the difference was not always evident with the internal infection metric . under australian field conditions, infection is driven by sexual ascospores and often results in seedling death for susceptible plants  <cit> . this means very few susceptible plants will remain standing at the end of the growing season when internal infection is assessed. however, the remaining survivors have been enriched for escapes i.e. plants that did not develop the same level of disease due to a delay in, or lack of, exposure to the pathogen, particularly when seedling germination is not consistent. this would result in an under-estimate of internal infection for individual lines, as only a portion of the standing plants are assessed. the same effect would not be as significant in the survival metric where the entire row is counted.

the genomic location of the tc a <dig> qtl interval matches the previously reported position of a blackleg qtl from the australian cultivar ag-spectrum  <cit> . a recent report detailing qtl mapping in european winter oilseed rape populations  <cit>  placed qtl from grizzly/bristol and darmor/bristol populations within a region of a <dig> that spans the tc a <dig> qtl locus defined in our study . qtl on chromosome a <dig> have also previously been reported for several dh populations derived from australian varieties, including av-sapphire  <cit> . favourable alleles from the ag-castle a <dig> qtl locus  are positioned adjacent to the qlma8_db qtls previously identified in the darmor/bristol population, which were positioned between the ssr markers bn <dig> and sr <dig>  on chromosome a <dig>  <cit> , and to the dy a <dig> qtl detected in the darmor-bzh/yudal population  <cit> . additionally, the ts a <dig> qtl locus from av-sapphire provides a near-complete overlap with the previously-reported syntenic a. thaliana region at3g25805–at3g <dig> , which was identified as syntenic to the lma <dig> qtl interval from the darmor-bzh/yudal qtl map  <cit> . finally, qtls from aviso and darmor/bristol populations were also placed within a  <dig> gene interval  on lower c <dig>  <cit> , which is in agreement with the large c <dig> qtl regions detected in both the tc and ts populations. the correlation of blackleg qtl in many of the studied b. napus varieties suggests the overall pool of apr genetics utilised in canola varieties world-wide may be rather limited.

pedigree analysis for ag-castle suggests nearly half of the variety’s genetic contribution  is derived from japanese material, with european material making up the bulk of the remainder   <cit> . a study of b. napus germplasm diversity has shown the variety ag-spectrum is closely related to rainbow  <cit> , an australian polygenic resistant variety which is also featured in the pedigree for ag-castle  <cit> . the b. napus variety major, a progenitor of the well-characterised french apr variety darmor  was grouped into a different clade than rainbow and ag-spectrum  <cit> , suggesting a low over-all genomic relationship between sources of apr for the australian and european qtl studies. however, the correlation of qtl on a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and c <dig> between australian and french varieties demonstrates a high degree of selection and retention of these qtl after the introduction of french apr germplasm into australian breeding programs  <cit> , suggesting enduring efficacy of these qtl against australian l. maculans populations. however, a “slow erosion of polygenic resistance” has been observed in australian breeding programs  <cit>  and suggests that future efforts should be focused on the detection and introgression of novel apr genetics from diverse brassica germplasm rather than the continued recycling of over-used qtl. interestingly, the b. juncea line bj <dig> also makes a small contribution  to the pedigree of ag-castle and many other australian varieties, though none of the major r genes from b. juncea have been introgressed into australian cultivars  <cit> . these r genes, present in the b genome of b. juncea, are potentially valuable sources of resistance for b. napus breeding if stably introgressed . however, little is known of the quantitative resistance potential of the b. juncea a genome, which harbours distinct genomic diversity  <cit> , or if b. juncea a genome introgressions have contributed to the pool of blackleg apr utilised in australian germplasm, and this remains a potentially under-utilised resource for resistance genetics.

investigation of the genomic region defined by the tc a <dig> peak qtl interval revealed a cluster of cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase genes . crks are characterised by one or more extracellular c-x8-c-x2-c motifs  that likely mediate protein-protein interactions  <cit> . crk genes have been shown to be induced in plants during pathogen infection , including the upregulation of several crks during infection of b. napus cotyledons by l. maculans  <cit> . active early in the plant defence response to pathogens, crks are induced independent of other host response genes such as eds <dig> or npr <dig>  <cit> . while some members of the crk superfamily have been demonstrated to enhance resistance against pathogens by promoting hypersensitive response  and salicylic acid  accumulation  <cit> , the use of knock-out mutants and transient gene silencing has suggested that some other crks can negatively affect defense responses, acting in a quantitative fashion  <cit> . crks have also been shown to have a role in symbiotic plant-microbe interactions, with the symcrk gene of the legume medicago truncatula being required for maintenance of functional nodules and the suppression of host defense during the symbiotic process  <cit> . recently it was demonstrated that over-expression of some arabidopsis crks enhanced pti defense responses, such as oxidative burst, stomatal closure and callose deposition, towards the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  additionally, these proteins were shown to associate with the pattern-recognition receptor flagellin sensing <dig>  at the plasma membrane  <cit> , an essential component of the bacterial pathogen pamp response  <cit> . a second study, profiling a near-complete set of arabidopsis crk mutants, showed some crks respond to fungal chitin, a common pti elicitor  <cit> , and play a role in regulating stomatal closure  <cit> . the roles of crks in quantitative plant defense responses suggests the cluster of crk genes co-localised with the tc a <dig> qtl interval offer viable candidate genes for blackleg apr. further study of these genes, including their temporal and spatial regulation in response to l. maculans infection, is currently underway. while the other qtl intervals defined in this study were not small enough to warrant extensive candidate gene studies, other crk homologues were found with the ts a <dig>  and ts c <dig>  intervals.

while no stable qtl were detected in which the resistant allele originated from the topas “susceptible” parent, it should be noted that in most environments topas had a higher survival percentage than the commonly-used susceptible line westar . under the disease nursery conditions in australia, the westar rows showed near-complete seedling death, often leaving no plants at all at the end of the growing season, while the topas rows still produced some adult plants, though most were dead or highly cankered at the time of rating. it is conceivable that topas contains some small degree of apr common to both ag-castle and av-sapphire, and perhaps many other b. napus cultivars, which would not be detectable as qtl in these populations. while some topas-derived qtl were detected during the study, these were always specific to a single testing environment, usually accounted for less than 5 % of the variance and were not associated with any significant met qtl . under the extremely high disease pressure of the horsham  <dig> trial, both topas and westar had 0 % survival , so any minor apr that may have been expressed by topas was rendered completely ineffective under those conditions.

our single-isolate characterisation of the tc and ts populations also delimited the physical positions of the major r genes rlm <dig> and rlm <dig> to intervals of  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb, respectively, on chromosome a <dig>  while these genes have been known to cluster genetically, along with rlm <dig> and rlm <dig>  on a <dig> for over a decade  <cit> , this is the first report to define a physical location for this cluster in the b. napus genome. previously, raman et al.  positioned the rlm <dig> gene , assessed at both the cotyledon and adult plant stages, to a  <dig>  cm interval of a <dig> using snp markers. while the physical interval relative to b. napus was not defined in this study, several snps corresponding to approximately  <dig> – <dig>  mb  on b. napus a <dig> were associated with the rlm <dig> locus  <cit> . this location would be in agreement with the rlm <dig> physical interval defined for the ts population in this study  and the co-segregation of the locus with the ssr marker sr <dig> .

neither rlm <dig> nor rlm <dig> were found to be associated with qtl detected in the field studies, suggesting a high degree of virulence towards both r genes in the populations of l. maculans infesting the disease nurseries. this result was not unexpected, as high rates of virulence towards rlm <dig>  <cit>  and rlm <dig>  <cit>  have been previously reported for australian l. maculans isolates. analysing the cotyledon reactions to single l. maculans isolates avirulent towards the respective r genes produced high lod, high variance ‘cotqtl’ loci associated with each gene, as expected. an additional cotyledon-responsive interaction with the isolate wa <dig> was also demonstrated in the tc population which accounted for  <dig>  % of the cotyledon phenotypic variation and localised to the c <dig> qtl interval . no additional significant cotyledon-responsive qtl were detected in the ts population, which also contains a c <dig> qtl locus, using isolate v <dig> . <dig>  previous studies have observed a significant difference in l. maculans cotyledon lesion development between apr and non-apr varieties  <cit> . cotyledon-expressed qtl similar to the one detected in our study have also previously been defined in the sasdh  population and localised on chromosomes a <dig> and a <dig>  though only the a <dig> qtl was associated with field resistance in the adult plant. these cotyledon qtl interactions also appeared to be race-specific, having been detected with the l. maculans isolate 06mgpp <dig> but not isolate 04mgps <dig>  <cit> . blackleg resistance at seedling and adult stages of the host have often been viewed as separate mechanisms; the former governed by race-specific r gene interaction in cotyledons and leaves, and the latter by non-specific qtl active in the stem. the detection of common qtl loci in both seedling  and adult plant  tests, and the differential interaction of individual l. maculans isolates to those qtl, suggests that such distinctions are not always valid. the associated resistance response is likely triggered early in the interaction between host and pathogen, activated long before entry of the pathogen into the stem tissues of the plant. the action of these qtl may be to impair the initial infection process, rather than to actively resist invasion of adult stem tissues, leading to delayed development of stem canker symptoms in the adult plant. if the quantitative blackleg resistance found in b. napus is truly “non-race specific” then the entirety of the environmental variance observed in field trials can be attributed to differences in the physical environmental factors  affecting each trial. however, if l. maculans isolates react differentially to qtl, then a large component of the environmental variance could be explained by variation in the pathogen populations used in the trials, both between sites and years. alternatively, as it has been previously shown that b. napus blackleg r genes require other partner proteins in order to successful trigger the resistance response to l. maculans  <cit> , minor qtl detected during cotyledon tests may represent either allelic variation or altered transcriptional patterns for r gene interacting proteins. further dissection of the temporal and spatial effects of quantitative resistance responses during l. maculans infection, as well as the effectiveness of these responses against a number of diverse isolates, will aid in bettering our overall understanding of the blackleg resistance response and how best to utilise the available genetics in crop protection.

CONCLUSIONS
as pathogen populations become enriched for virulence against commonly-deployed r genes, alternative resistance genetics need to be incorporated into crop breeding programs in order to maintain global agricultural production. the identification and mapping of qtl is required for the efficient introgression of stable resistance genetics in modern mas breeding programs, enabling the effective utilisation of quantitative genetics in plant protection. in this study we have delineated four stable blackleg resistance qtl through multi-environment qtl analysis. we have identified a cluster of cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase genes associated with a significant field-derived qtl, suggesting a role for these genes in quantitative defense responses to l. maculans. the genomic delineation of effective blackleg resistance qtl described in this work should benefit resistance breeding efforts, and further the investigation into the identity of genes controlling apr in brassica germplasm.
