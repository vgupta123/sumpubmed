BACKGROUND
wheat-containing products are worldwide an important part of the human daily menu. hexaploid bread wheat  and tetraploid durum wheat  are the most common wheat species grown for food production. the differences in food-technological qualities between both wheat species are largely determined by the composition of the gluten fraction in the grains. gluten, the water-insoluble fraction of wheat seed-storage proteins, consists of the high- and low molecular weight subunit glutenins  and the monomeric gliadins   <cit> .

gluten proteins are relatively resistant to proteolysis. several specific bioactive gluten peptides have been identified that survive proteolysis in the human intestine and that can stimulate t cells  <cit>  and trigger celiac disease  in genetically susceptible individuals. cd is a t cell mediated chronic inflammatory condition of the small intestine  <cit>  with prevalence between  <dig>  and 2% in human populations  <cit> . the immunogenic peptide sequences have highly specific cores of at least nine amino acids length  <cit> , and become active after deamidation by the enzyme tissue transglutaminase in the intestine  <cit> . there are natural epitope variants that lack immunogenicity due to single or multiple amino acid substitutions. for instance, a p to s substitution at the epitope core position  <dig> was shown to be sufficient to abolish t cell stimulation  <cit> .

t cell clones isolated from intestinal celiac lesions showed differential responses to diploid aegilops and triticum species that are related to the ancestors of the a, b, and d genomes  <cit> . these differences in t cell responses between diploid aegilops and triticum species especially related to the presence of three cd epitopes derived from alpha-gliadins, dq <dig> -glia-α <dig> , dq <dig> -glia-α <dig>  and dq <dig> -glia-α <dig> ; in these epitopes glutamic acid  is originating from deamidated glutamine   <cit> . the source of these epitopes, the alpha-gliadins, are encoded by a multigene family located on three homoeologous loci, gli-a <dig>  gli-b <dig> and gli-d <dig> on the short arms of wheat group  <dig> chromosomes . estimates of the copy number of alpha-gliadins range from  <dig> copies to even  <dig> copies per haploid genome, reflecting the large complexity of this gene family  <cit> . the large majority  of the genes contain internal stop codons and are presumably pseudogenes  <cit> .

limiting the abundance of cd epitopes in food products may reduce the risk of sensitization of the immune system of the group of people that are genetically susceptible for cd. in order to breed and select for wheat varieties with significantly reduced immunogenic potential to cause cd it is necessary to accurately estimate the quantity and quality of the cd epitope load in gluten. up to now, the ability for high throughput quantification of cd epitopes by presently available assays based on t cell clones and on monoclonal antibodies is very limited, mainly because of the high complexity of the wheat material on the one hand, and the laboriousness of in vitro t cell assays and the promiscuity of the monoclonal antibodies on the other hand  <cit> . in addition, most commercial kits with monoclonal antibodies detect gluten, not cd epitopes.

next-generation sequencing platforms offer now the possibility of efficient and accurate deep sequencing of genetic variation at moderate costs  <cit> . still, the application of such technologies in bread wheat is a big challenge due to the large genome , the allohexaploid nature and the abundance of repetitive sequences  <cit> . to reduce difficulties with the alignment of sequences for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms , often ‘reduced representation libraries’ are used that include only a subset of sequences from several individuals representative for different populations  <cit>  or from tissue-specific transcriptomes   <cit> . in wheat, next-generation sequence studies for snp detection have been performed on material with a reduced complexity such as the bread wheat transcriptome  <cit> , diploid aegilops tauschii <cit> , or specific subsets of dna fragments  <cit> .

rnaseq by illumina sequencing produces short sequences. short reads of alpha-gliadins cannot readily be assembled as the members of the gene family are very similar. hence, such a method would enable to calculate average presence/absence of epitopes, but not show how these epitopes are distributed across genes. quantitative pcr methods require the design of specific primers for the amplification of specific family members. it can be done in gene families when the members are sufficiently differentiated , but the alpha-gliadins are far too similar and too numerous to enable development of primers that would allow quantitative amplification of all members.

with the aim to develop a pre-screening tool for the classification of wheat varieties according to their cd immunogenic potential, here a next generation sequencing technology was developed and applied that uses a  <dig> sequencer to perform rna-amplicon sequencing. the  <dig> reads are sufficiently long to enable direct sequencing of the region of alpha-gliadin genes, that includes the three major cd epitopes. the complexity of the alpha-gliadin gene family was reduced by  focussing on the n-terminal, cd epitope containing region of alpha-gliadins, and  avoiding silent pseudogenes by sequencing the alpha-gliadin transcriptome  of developing seeds. the method is applicable to wheat species regardless of ploidy level. a custom  <dig> sequence analysis pipeline was used to quantify cd epitopes and their variants in the alpha-gliadin transcriptomes of a set of  <dig> individual plants from  <dig> different durum wheat accessions, by determining the normalised transcript abundances for the respective cd epitopes and variants thereof.

RESULTS
rna-amplicon sequencing and sequence analysis pipeline
to assess a large, diverse set of durum wheat landraces and genebank accessions for their cd epitope content, a deep  <dig> rna-amplicon sequencing pipeline was developed to target the genetic variation in the first repetitive domain of alpha-gliadins , which contains the major cd epitopes dq <dig> -glia-α <dig>  dq <dig> -glia-α <dig> and dq <dig> -glia-α <dig>  a custom sequence analysis pipeline  was developed to process the 454-reads derived from the rna-amplicon and subsequently the variation in the abundance of unique alpha-gliadin transcripts was determined. in this way an estimate of the alpha-gliadin protein composition and cd epitope composition was made for the  <dig> durum wheat plants from  <dig> different durum wheat cultivars and accessions, including landraces and breeders material .

for  <dig> rna-amplicon sequencing, alpha-gliadin amplicons derived from cdnas from developing seeds of single plants were uniquely labelled with a 10 bp identification  sequence and subsequently sequenced in three  <dig> runs to obtain detailed sequence information on the expressed alpha-gliadin fraction in developing seeds . in total over all samples  <dig>  454-reads derived from alpha-gliadin transcripts were analysed . in the process of sequence analysis these reads were organized into  <dig> ‘unique sequence clusters’  that represented the cd epitope-containing regions of alpha-gliadin genes expressed in the developing seeds. based on the nucleotide sequences of these unique sequence clusters,  <dig> ‘unique deduced protein fragments’  were predicted  that represented the predicted amino acid variants of the first variable domain of alpha-gliadins that are expressed in the endosperm. a upf could be encoded by one or more sequence clusters. in total  <dig> of the  <dig> upfs were encoded by a single unique sequence cluster. on the other hand one upf  was encoded by as many as  <dig> sequence clusters and this was the only upf that was present in all  <dig> plants. the sequence variation among the upfs was studied in a neighbour joining analysis and three groups were recognised . based on the presence of several amino acid motifs  that are specific for the different sub-genomes of wheat, the upfs were assigned to a specific sub-genome. although durum wheat contains only the a and b genome, six protein fragments with a d-genomic signature were found. four of these came from a genebank accession of a landrace  that is known to consist of a mixture of tetraploid and hexaploid genotypes with indistinguishable phenotypes  <cit> . such a mixture is not uncommon in genebank accessions  <cit> . the two other alpha-gliadin protein fragments with a d genome signature showed also signatures of the b genome alpha-gliadins and were present at low abundance in several breeding lines of durum wheat . the great majority of the alpha-gliadin transcripts showed an a-genomic signature  with normalised transcript abundances for upfs that ranged from  <dig> in the elite durum wheat variety ‘ixos9442’, to  <dig> and  <dig> in ‘cim-10204’, a line from the international maize and wheat improvement center , and in line ‘cgn08006-2b’ respectively .

alpha gliadin expression profiles
each  <dig> sample contained the alpha-gliadin fraction that is expressed in developing seeds of a single durum wheat plant. for each sample, a list of upfs and epitope variants were obtained . the quantitative output of the sequence analysis pipeline consisted of the normalised transcript abundance for upfs  and cd epitopes and sequence variants of those epitopes. across all samples , the dominant alpha-gliadin protein fragment was upf-p <dig> whereas all others were only present in subsets of the plants analysed . to analyse the differential upf profiles of the wheat samples a hierarchical clustering  was carried out. based on the normalised transcript abundances and differential presence of the upfs the samples clustered into ten groups which suggests ten different profiles for expressed alpha-gliadins  . due to the concerted presence of upf-p <dig> and subsets of lowly abundant upfs, the correlation among the different upf profiles was high. the differential expression of several highly abundant  upf components alone already enabled to distinguish the ten distinct alpha-gliadin expression profiles .

the main upfs for expression profiles  and their average normalised transcript abundances are shown. the main upf of profiles have an average normalised transcript abundance >  <dig>  in average over all samples with a specific profile, and are expressed in all the plants with that profile. the part of the amino acid sequence of the upfs that harbours dq <dig> -glia α <dig> to -α <dig> is depicted, with p to s substitutions and other substitutions depicted in bold; underlined are canonical dq <dig> -glia a <dig>  -α <dig> and α <dig> epitopes. each expression profile, group 1– <dig>  represents a total of respectively,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> alpha-gliadin transcript  <dig> sequences. in case of identical amino acid fragments, the different proteins can be distinguished by differences in sequences outside the depicted sequence.

reproducibility of the analysis
to test the reproducibility of the analysis, in  <dig> cases duplicate cdna samples from developing seeds of the same plant were analysed. the correlation between samples from the same plants  was high , indicating a very good reproducibility of the analysis . the breeding line ‘primadur’ was included in two  <dig> runs to confirm the technical reproducibility of an alpha-gliadin expression pattern over two  <dig> runs. the characteristic components upf-p <dig>  -p <dig>  -p <dig> and -p <dig> of alpha-gliadin expression profile  <dig>  were reproducible over the runs  .

sensitivity of the analysis
the  <dig> sequence analysis pipeline showed to be a sensitive platform to detect individual wheat plants with specific alpha-gliadin expression profiles. plants that share the same alpha-gliadin expression profile can be recognized by the presence of characteristic upf components  together with a high correlation  in pairwise comparisons between profiles .

among plants that share the same alpha-gliadin expression profile, besides the upfs that are characteristic for the profiles, minor differences in the profile were detectable. for instance, two different plants of accession primadur , both with expression profile  <dig> , showed differences in the range of the lower abundant alpha-gliadins components . for the breeding line ‘np400’ two different stages of seed development were analysed . the main components of expression profile  <dig> were present in both developmental stages and also in this case only several lowly abundant upfs were differentially present between plants and developmental stages . the same observation was made for differences in the year of cultivation , indicating the stable expression of sets of highly expressed alpha-gliadin gene variants during endosperm development whereas the presence of several ‘lowly abundant’ alpha-gliadins  is more variable among plants and under different conditions. alternatively, at low abundance they are less consistently detected.

differences in sequence depth may influence the number of lowly expressed alpha-gliadins detected. for  <dig> plants  with expression profile  <dig> the number of unique nucleotide clusters increased  with the number of analysed 454-reads per sample .

heterogeneity within accessions
on the basis of transcript profiles of abundant upfs  it was possible to distinguish ten alpha-gliadin expression profiles. most  accessions from cimmyt showed little variation in alpha-gliadin expression profile, and grouped together in a cluster of  <dig> plants  with expression profile  <dig> . for landraces more variation within accessions was observed; ‘st.  <dig> ethiopia’ , diha dzhavakhetskaja  and ‘dibillik sinde’  harboured a mixture of genotypes with different expression profiles. among the five dibillik sinde plants that were analysed two different expression profiles were observed, expression profile  <dig> and  <dig>  in a mutual comparison of these two alpha-gliadin expression profiles of the five dibillik sinde plants, identical expression profiles showed a high correlation  whereas among different expression profiles a lower correlation was observed  indicating the sensitivity of the  <dig> sequence analysis method to distinguish the different alpha-gliadin expression profiles. the material sampled from different regions was diverse, and a unique alpha-gliadin variation  was found in the egyptian durum wheat accession ‘dakar52’. expression profiles  <dig> and  <dig> only occurred in material from western europe. plants with expression profiles  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were found in material from the southern parts of the geographical region  . each of the  <dig> alpha-gliadin expression profiles included several dominant alpha-gliadin protein variants  and some of these harboured amino acid changes in the cd epitope region that, according to mitea et al.  <cit> , may eliminate the potential immunogenicity of the cd epitopes cores.

cd epitope abundance across plants
the cd epitopes dq <dig> -glia-α <dig> and dq <dig> -glia-α <dig> were present in all plants . however, in several plants with expression profile  <dig>  the normalised abundance of transcripts coding for dq <dig> -glia-α <dig> was reduced by half. this was observed in  <dig> cm, ‘82715’, ‘durental’ , with normalised transcript abundances for dq <dig> -glia-α <dig> of only respectively  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig>  for cd epitope dq <dig> -glia-α <dig> the encoding transcript abundance in the endosperm was reduced by more than 40% in several accessions with expression profile 1; e.g. in dibillik sinde  and ‘cim-10182’ . cd epitope dq <dig> -glia-α <dig> was only found in high numbers in two out of four plants of the landrace diha dzhavakhetskaja , which were the only plants that expressed upfs with a clear d genome signature.

taken together, sequences coding for dq <dig> -restricted cd epitopes were found in alpha-gliadin transcripts of all durum wheat samples with an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  epitopes per alpha-gliadin transcript . a selection from landrace dibillik sinde  with  <dig>  epitopes per transcript, the elite durum wheat cultivar durental  with  <dig> - <dig>  epitopes per transcript and selection  <dig> cm  with  <dig>  epitopes per transcript scored relative low compared to for instance ‘cim-10139’  with  <dig>  epitopes per transcript. the lower number of cd epitopes was due to the presence of alpha-gliadin upfs with a proline  to serine  substitution on position p <dig> of both epitopes dq <dig> -glia-α <dig> and dq <dig> -glia-α <dig>  or an arginine  to proline  or glutamine  substitution on position p <dig> in dq <dig> -glia-α <dig> . both changes lead to peptides that are found to have lost the capacity to trigger an in vitro response in hla-dq <dig>  restricted t cell clones  <cit> .

discussion
the gluten fraction of wheat contains proteins that can trigger a t cell reaction in celiac disease  patients, leading to inflammatory responses in the small intestine. major cd epitopes, dq <dig> -glia-α <dig>  -α <dig> and -α <dig>  <cit>  are found in the first variable domain of wheat alpha-gliadins. to quantify the cd epitopes and their natural variants present in wheat varieties and accessions, and to investigate the possibility to select wheat varieties with a reduced cd immunogenic potential, a high throughput  <dig> sequence analysis pipeline was developed here to analyse the epitope-containing region in alpha-gliadin genes of tetraploid durum wheat. this region is between 240 bp and 282 bp  long, which is in range with the read-length of  <dig> sequences  <cit> . the amplicons sequenced ranged from 173 bp to 321 bp, with a median length of 262 bp, before sequence trimming. to exclude the many pseudogenes present in the alpha-gliadin loci the focus of this study was on alpha-gliadin transcripts, and not on genome sequences  <cit> . in case of alpha-gliadins most pseudogenes have premature stop-codons at specific positions  <cit> . some of these genes may be transcribed, and especially when the stop codon occurs near the 3′ end of the gene they may escape the nonsense-decay mechanism  <cit> . such transcripts are part of the amplicons, but this is correct as, whenever the premature stop codon occurs downstream of the cd epitopes coding region of the gene, they can be a source of immunogenic peptides.

the sequence analysis pipeline included a number of steps: sequence truncation, repair of  <dig> sequence mistakes, two rounds of sequence clustering, identification of unique alpha-gliadin transcripts, unique deduced alpha gliadin protein fragments , and cd epitope variants, and count of 454-reads per variant. snps and indels are the most abundant forms of dna sequence variation in common wheat and its relatives  <cit> , which was confirmed in our alpha-gliadins. the pipeline thus enabled the use of 44% of the  <dig>  transcript reads, which coded for an overall number of  <dig> unique alpha-gliadin protein fragments .

based on conserved amino acid stretches that are indicative for gliadins from the homoeologous loci gli-2a and gli-2b <cit>  expression from the gli-2a locus was estimated to be much higher  compared to expression from gli-2b . unequal transcription from homoeologous alpha-gliadin loci in wheat has been shown in other studies . also, kawaura et al.  <cit>  observed that gli-2b transcripts were underrepresented compared to their homoeologs from the a and d genomes in a set of expressed sequence tags from dbest. two alpha-gliadin protein fragments with a combined d and b genome signature that were observed in a couple of breeding lines of durum wheat most likely represent d-like alpha-gliadin genes expressed from the b genome. the presence of such alpha-gliadins with an intermixed genomic signature probably reflects their common ancestry. in gamma-gliadins sequences from different genomes are even harder to distinguish as separate groups  <cit> .

alpha-gliadin gene expression
the alpha-gliadin promoter is active in the wheat endosperm from 11 days after anthesis until maturity, which is about 4 weeks after anthesis  <cit> . kawaura et al.  <cit>  observed that nine of twelve intact alpha-gliadin genes of bread wheat were expressed in distinct patterns during endosperm development, whereas three were not expressed. we have harvested inflorescence spikes at 21 days after anthesis of the first flower, from which seeds from the milk to soft dough developmental stages were selected. the profiles of expressed alpha-gliadins that are shown in the present study were reproducible  and stable and the major components  of the profiles were not related to differences in developmental stage or environmental conditions .

in comparisons among plants sharing the same expression profile the minor components  of the expression profiles were more prone to variation, which may be due to differences in sequence depth but also environmental differences and /or differences in the genetic background of plants may play a role.

however, it cannot be excluded that some early or late expressed alpha-gliadin variants may have been missed or are underrepresented but, it is unlikely that many genes are missing because of selective amplification, as the reverse primer used here covers all variants that are present in a set of  <dig>  expressed alpha-gliadin sequences from  <dig> bread wheat cultivars and various tissues and treatments  <cit>  and the forward primer covers all but two variants. furthermore, all alpha-gliadin ests of cultivar ‘butte 86’ as assembled by altenbach et al.  <cit>  contained the forward and reverse primer sequences used here.

several lines of evidence support the occurrence of different expression patterns among alpha-gliadin genes. first, differences among groups of alpha-gliadin ests were observed between the genomes  <cit>  and in developing endosperm  <cit>  in terms of numbers of reads per contig. secondly, using pyrosequencing differences in expression among alpha-gliadins were shown in tetraploids, and some of them had differences in cd epitopes as well  <cit> , although the power of resolution of targeted  <dig> sequencing as used in the present study is much higher.

based on the genetic variation in the part of the alpha-gliadin genes analysed here, as many as  <dig> to  <dig> different alpha-gliadin genes are expressed in a single tetraploid durum wheat plant from the two combined homoeologous gli- <dig> loci. this number will be approximately doubled when the variation in the signal peptide sequence would be taken into account , and even higher when the variation in the repetitive domains towards the 3′-end of the genes, which we did not sequence here, is considered.

alpha-gliadin protein profiles
reproducible and stable gliadin protein profiles are applied as markers in wheat breeding and have been used to study crop genetic diversity in a global collection of durum wheat  <cit> . blocks of protein bands in electrophoretic profiles of gliadins inherit as linked groups and display a stable co-dominant inheritance, indicating that they are encoded by alpha-gliadin genes from one gli- <dig> locus. the patterns of blocks are described in detail in a catalogue of alleles  <cit> . consistent with this, also some of the  <dig> alpha-gliadin protein fragments  showed distinct and reproducible expression profiles among the durum wheat plants and accordingly the protocol presented may be useful to detect genetic variation among wheat varieties. the material from cimmyt showed low genetic diversity and nearly all of these accessions displayed the alpha-gliadin expression profile  <dig>  melnikova et al.  <cit>  also observed high similarity in gliadin protein profiles in material from breeding centres, which they considered to be the result of strong selection for plant homogeneity for breeding traits. some of the alpha-gliadin expression profiles observed by them were exclusively found in material from northern regions  whereas others were only found in material from the south   <cit> . similarly, in the material studied here distinct southern and northern alpha-gliadin expression profiles are observed using profiling of an alpha-gliadin rna-amplicon by  <dig> sequencing. unique alpha-gliadin transcript variation was observed in the egyptian durum wheat accession dakar  <dig> .

differences in cd epitope composition among durum wheat accessions
a wide variation in both gluten composition and t cell immunological activation was found among tetraploid farro wheats  by vincentini et al.  <cit> , some of these ‘dicoccum’ landraces possibly being low in cd-immunogenic gluten proteins. here, mainly accessions of triticum turgidum spp. durum were analysed and although some variation in cd epitope content was found, none of the accessions was completely devoid of cd epitopes, as transcripts  with the major hladq <dig>  restricted cd epitopes were present in all samples, albeit at different rates. in accession  <dig> cm and the elite cultivar durental, both having alpha-gliadin expression profile  <dig>  the number of transcripts coding for cd epitope dq <dig> -glia-α <dig>  as determined by normalised transcript abundance, was halved compared to samples with other alpha-gliadin expression profiles. another accession, a selection from landrace dibillik sinde  with expression profile  <dig>  scored low for cd epitope dq <dig> -glia-α <dig>  the reduction in cd epitopes in durum wheat accessions with expression profile  <dig> is due to the high expression rate of alpha-gliadins with a proline  to serine  substitution on position p <dig> in dq <dig> -glia-α <dig> and dq <dig> -glia-α <dig>  which creates epitope variants that are not capable to trigger an in vitro response in hla-dq <dig>  restricted t cell clones that are specific for the respective cd epitopes  <cit> . using an immunoblotting procedure with monoclonal antibodies against dq <dig> -glia-α <dig>  and dq <dig> -glia-α <dig>  van den broeck et al.  <cit>  also selected several genotypes that are apparently low in both cd epitopes and in line with the results from the rna-amplicon profiling shown here, a protein extract of a plant of landrace dibillik sinde  was selected by these authors as having the lowest affinity for binding with the epitope-specific antibody. other accessions showed, however, no clear correlation between the two studies. probably this is due to the limitations of antibodies, which have a shorter minimal recognition site  and may not be able to detect all amino acid substitutions. on the other hand transcripts undergo translation before they end up in the protein bodies. in that respect integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data will provide the ultimate tool for determining the cd epitope load in individual wheat plants.

CONCLUSIONS
the dedicated  <dig> rna-amplicon sequencing pipeline for alpha-gliadin transcripts can be used as a tool to detect genetic diversity in wheat alpha-gliadins. using this tool, wheat germplasm can be screened for plants that are potentially less cd-immunogenic. the sequence data obtained in the process are providing a database for further proteomics analysis of the selected plants, regarding the immunogenic potential of the final gluten composition in mature grains. a few plants showed lower normalised transcript abundances for specific cd epitopes, but the fact that major cd epitopes were found to be present in most alpha-gliadin genes and in all accessions tested, indicates that among the durum wheat plants tested no genotype has been found that is safe for cd patients. moreover, it seems unlikely that conventional selection and breeding within this tetraploid germplasm will lead to the development of varieties that are safe to individuals with cd. for that reason we are currently screening commercial t. monococcum spp.  varieties and accessions. as an alternative, the  <dig> rna-amplicon sequencing strategy will be useful to analyse the cd epitope profiles in wheat lines with induced mutations, such as panels of radiation hybrids  <cit>  and deletion lines  <cit> , as potential starting material for breeding of cd-safe wheat.
