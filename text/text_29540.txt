BACKGROUND
the pax <dig> transcription factor contains a paired domain and a homeodomain and is expressed in a complex spatio-temporal pattern during development of the retina, lens and cornea, in regions of the forebrain, hindbrain, cerebellum and spinal cord, the olfactory system and in pancreatic islet cells  <cit> . haploinsufficiency for pax <dig> function  in the mouse results in the small eye  phenotype. homozygotes  die perinatally with no eyes, no nasal structures and many severe brain abnormalities  <cit> .pax <dig> haploinsufficiency also causes eye and brain defects in humans  <cit> 

pax <dig> was the first isoform of the pax <dig> gene to be described  <cit>  and is generated by the alternative splicing of exon 5a. the inclusion of this exon disrupts the paired domain and alters its dna binding properties, potentially allowing pax <dig> to activate a different set of downstream target genes  <cit>  although the function of the pax <dig> isoform has not yet been determined, a number of studies have attempted to address the phenotypic implications of this alternative splicing event. for example, in the eye, constitutive deletion of murine exon 5a leads to iris hypoplasia, alongside defects in the development of the cornea, lens and retina  <cit> . conversely, overexpression of pax <dig> in the mouse lens leads to the formation of cataracts and up-regulation of a number of cellular adhesion molecules  <cit> , while pax <dig> overexpression in the chick retina induces hyperplasia of the neural retina  <cit> . evidence from studies in vertebrates suggests that the functions of pax <dig> and pax <dig> differ  <cit> , which mirrors differences between the functions of their homologues in invertebrates  <cit> .

two promoters are thought to be responsible for the majority of pax <dig> expression. they are known as p <dig> and p <dig> in quail and mouse  <cit>  for pax <dig> transcription  <cit> , but whether the introduction of pax <dig> it is sufficient to induce or upregulate expression from the intact locus is not known.

to search for evidence of positive autoregulation of an intact locus, we generated murine neuroblastoma and fibroblast cell lines  <cit> . with stable integration of constructs generating either one or other of the major isoforms of pax <dig> .

RESULTS
neuro2a cells express pax <dig> at low levels. pax <dig> proteins were not detected reliably with immunocytochemistry in untransfected cells  but transfection with constructs expressing pax <dig> or pax <dig> produced cells that were strongly immunoreactive . following selection, cell lines with stable integration of constructs expressing either pax <dig> or pax <dig> were generated. western blots showed that these over-expressing lines produced increased levels of pax <dig> proteins . pax <dig> proteins were only detectable in western blots on control neuro2a lines when the amount of protein loaded per lane was increased 5-fold .

the ability of pax <dig> over-expressing neuro2a cells to differentiate along a neuronal pathway was assessed, to ascertain whether the responses of neuro2a cells to an increased pax <dig> level mimicked known responses of primary cells to pax <dig> over-expression. pax <dig> regulates neuronal differentiation and its over-expression in brain cells promotes neurogenesis  <cit> . neuro2a cells can spontaneously differentiate along a neuronal pathway in culture  <cit>  and we tested whether over-expression of pax <dig> proteins would promote this process. following seeding onto glass coverslips or plastic wells, the morphology of over-expressing cells was altered from that of control cells, in that they appeared larger and had longer neurites, and their levels of expression of the neuronal marker β-iii-tubulin were higher . the percentage of cells expressing the neuronal marker, β-iii-tubulin, was higher in all four over-expressing lines  than in control lines expressing green fluorescent protein  alone  . we conclude that over-expression of pax <dig> proteins promotes neurogenesis in neuro2a cells, as it does in primary brain cells  <cit> .

we then quantified the levels of pax <dig> expression in four over-expressing neuro2a cell lines and in a control neuro2a cell line using densitometry on western blots of a series of 3– <dig> protein extracts from each line . the density of each pax <dig> and pax <dig> band was reported relative to that of the β-actin band for that lane and the fold over-expression was calculated relative to a value of  <dig> for the pax <dig> band in the control line. we found that stable introduction of constructs expressing either pax <dig> or pax <dig> increased production of not only the corresponding form of the protein, but also the other form . the increased production of both forms following introduction of constructs that could make only one form indicates that endogenous production must have increased. the introduction of pax <dig> expression constructs  increased production of pax <dig> but levels remained below those of pax <dig>  introduction of pax <dig> expression constructs  increased production of pax <dig> to levels above those of pax <dig> in one line and equal to those of pax <dig> in the other. none of the cell lines expressed more pax <dig> than pax <dig>  the pax6:pax <dig> ratios in the lines varied from  <dig> : <dig>  to  <dig> : <dig> . we concluded that endogenous production can respond positively to an increased level of either pax <dig> or pax <dig> protein and that the end-result is to maintain pax6:pax <dig> ratios close to those seen in brain cells in vivo, which range from around 3: <dig> to around 10: <dig> depending on age and tissue type  <cit> .

quantitative pcr  with primers specific to either pax <dig> or pax <dig>  was used to demonstrate upregulation of pax <dig> mrna in neuro2a cells transfected with the pax6-expressing contruct and vice-versa. figure  <dig> shows average fold increases in protein levels plotted against average fold increases in mrna levels for each of the four lines . there was a positive correlation between the mrna increase and the protein increase. these data confirm upregulation of transcription from the endogenous locus in response to introduction of either pax <dig> or pax <dig> expression constructs.

pax <dig> proteins were never detected in untransfected nih3t <dig> cells  but, as for neuro2a cells, were found by immunocytochemistry in transfected cells . western blots failed to detect pax <dig> proteins and rt-pcr failed to detect pax <dig> mrna in untransfected nih3t <dig> cells. in nih3t <dig> cell lines with stable integration of either pax <dig> or pax <dig> expression constructs, mrna and protein for both isoforms were detected. levels varied from line to line but were generally comparable to those in stably transfected neuro2a lines. whether the cells contained a pax <dig> expressing construct or a pax <dig> expressing construct, expression of the pax <dig> isoform was always higher than that of the pax <dig> isoform. the intensity of the pax <dig> and the pax <dig> bands in westerns were measured relative to the highest intensity found, which was assigned a value of  <dig> . in cells containing pax <dig> expressing constructs, the average intensity of the pax <dig> band was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and of the pax <dig> band was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . in cells containing pax <dig> expressing constructs, the average intensity of the pax <dig> band was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and of the pax <dig> band was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . pax6:pax <dig> ratios ranged from  <dig> : <dig> to  <dig> : <dig> in these cell lines. we concluded that the result of expressing either one or other isoform on the endogenous locus was the same in nih3t <dig> cells as in neuro2a cells. introduction of expression constructs into non-expressing cell lines was sufficient to induce expression from the endogenous locus.

discussion
we examined the effect of pax <dig> proteins on pax <dig> expression from its intact endogenous locus, rather than from isolated regulatory sequences, by driving either pax <dig> or pax protein from an integrated expression construct in cells and measuring the levels of production of both isoforms. we found that in cells containing a construct over-producing either one isoform or the other, production of both forms was increased within the cells. since increased production of the isoform that was not generated from the introduced construct must have come from the endogenous locus, we concluded that under these conditions pax <dig> proteins are capable of positively regulating an intact pax <dig> locus. in a cell line that does not normally express pax <dig>  introduction of pax <dig> or pax <dig> was sufficient to activate the endogenous locus. it was interesting to observe in these experiments that the ratio of the two forms remained close to values observed in vivo  <cit> . the induction from the endogenous locus of the isoform that was not introduced, which prevents non-physiological distortion of the pax6:pax <dig> ratio, might be revealing the existence of an autoregulatory mechanism controlling the relative levels of the two isoforms.

pax <dig> affects several aspects of eye and brain development, including progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation  <cit>  studies of pax6-/- mice have indicated that pax <dig> promotes proliferation during early cortical neurogenesis, but may have the opposite effect in the developing diencephalon, or indeed in the cortex at later stages of neurogenesis  <cit>  there is evidence that loss of pax <dig> promotes asymmetrical division and production of neurons in the early cortex of pax6-/- mice  <cit>  but that later neurogenesis is impaired in mutants  <cit> . in the retina, loss of pax <dig> accelerates neuronal differentiation  <cit> . whereas pax <dig> has an early role in patterning the developing nervous system  <cit> , it later adopts an important function in axon guidance  <cit> .

the changing roles of pax <dig> with age, and/or differences between its function in different tissues, might be due at least in part to a shift in the relative concentrations of pax <dig> and pax <dig>  <cit>  even relatively small changes in the ratio might be important since stronger effects on gene activity via pax <dig> and pax <dig> consensus binding sequences are observed if pax <dig> and pax <dig> are introduced into cultured cell lines at ratios of 1: <dig> or 8: <dig> rather than at ratios of 2: <dig>  4: <dig> or 16: <dig>  <cit> . there is evidence that the functions of pax <dig> and pax <dig> differ in vertebrates  <cit> , as do their homologues in invertebrates  <cit> . studies of pax6- and pax6-related genes in drosophila melanogaster, ey/toy and eyg/toe, have shown that they promote, respectively, differentiation and proliferation of eye precursor cells  <cit> . overexpression of pax <dig> and pax <dig> can alter the expression of different sets of genes in mammals  <cit>  mammalian brain cells reduce their proliferation in response to overexpression of pax <dig> or pax <dig> and increase their neurogenesis in response to overexpression of pax <dig>  <cit> . thus, regulation of the relative levels of the two isoforms is very important for normal development.

CONCLUSIONS
our data show the intact pax <dig> locus is subject to positive autoregulation and suggest this might provide a mechanism that stabilises the relative levels of the major isoforms of pax <dig>
