BACKGROUND
20-hydroxyecdyone , an active form of ecdysteroid, regulates insect postembryonic development and reproduction. because of the absence of the enzymes involving in squalene synthesis, insects cannot synthesize 20e de novo, and must obtain precursor sterols from their food  <cit> , or their associated yeasts or fungi  <cit> . rice planthoppers reportedly harbored yeast-like symbionts , mainly in mycetocytes formed by abdominal fat body cells  <cit> . the ylss synthesize ergosta- <dig> ,24-trienol  <cit> . ergosta- <dig> ,24-trienol is then converted into cholesterol in planthoppers  <cit> .

the ecdysteroid biosynthesis in the prothoracic glands  begins from conversion of cholesterol into 7-dehydrocholesterol , mediated by a rieske oxygenase neverland <cit> . the conversion of 7dc into  <dig> ,25-trideoxyecdysone  is a series of hypothetical and unproven reactions, and is called ‘black box’  <cit> . in drosophila melanogaster and bombyx mori, cyp307a1/a <dig>   <cit>  and cyp6t <dig>  <cit>  have been proven to be involved in the ‘black box’. moreover, a paralog spookiest  was also found in cyp <dig> family  <cit> . rnai mediated knockdown of spok in the pgs results in arrest of molting in d. melanogaster. feeding two 3-oxo steroids, cholesta- <dig> -diene- <dig> -dione-14α-ol  and 5β cholesta-7-ene- <dig> -dione-14a-ol , in the rnai-treated larvae triggered molting, enhanced amounts of ecdysteroids and induced 20e inducible genes  <cit> . these results indicate that Δ4-diketol and diketol are components of the ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathway and lie downstream of a step catalyzed by spok/spo. spo- and/or spok-like proteins had found in other insect species in diptera such as bemisia tabaci <cit> , in coleoptera such as the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum <cit> , in hymenoptera such as apis mellifera <cit> , in lepidoptera such as spodoptera littoralis <cit> , manduca sexta <cit>  and holcocerus hippophaecolus <cit> , in orthoptera such as schistocerca gregaria <cit> , and in hemiptera such as acyrthosiphon pisum <cit> . up to now, however, involvement of spo in ecdysteroidogenesis has not been confirmed in other insect species except d. melanogaster and b. mori.

most actions of 20e are mediated through their nuclear receptor, the ecdysone receptor  and its heterodimer partner ultraspiracle. mutations in and rna interference  against ecr cause phenotypic defects and lethality in t. castaneum <cit> , and in laodelphgax striatellus and nilaparvata lugens <cit> . moreover, ecr expression is regulated by ecdysteroids through a positive feedback loop directly  <cit>  or indirectly in d. melanogaster <cit> .

the white-backed planthopper, sogatella furcifera, was a secondary pest of rice before 1980s. however, since the mid-1980s, its population dramatically increased following a nationwide adoption of hybrid rice in china  <cit> . s. furcifera causes serious damage to rice plants by sucking the phloem sap and blocking the phloem vessels, and by acting as a virus vector to transmit southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus  <cit> . even though the complete genome sequence of s. furcifera is still unavailable, the transcriptome data have been published  <cit> . these data prompt us to identify and characterize the halloween genes. since dietary ingestion of double-stranded rna  can effectively knock down target genes in planthoppers  <cit> , our second goal in the present paper is to study the influence of the halloween gene dsrnas on the performance of s. furcifera nymphs, and the rescuing effects of 20e application on the negative influences of spo-dsrna in the nymphs. our results suggest that sfspo play a critical role in ecdysteroidogenesis in s. furcifera.

RESULTS
molecular cloning and sequence analysis
complete coding sequence of s. furcifera halloween gene sfspo  was obtained. its open reading frame  encoded a putative protein with the length of  <dig> amino acid residue .

spo sequence is similar to those from other insects. insect cyps have five insect conserved p <dig> motifs, i.e., wxxxr , gxe/dtt/s , exxr , pxxfxpe/drf  and pfxxgxrxcxg/a , where ‘x’ means any amino acid  <cit> . for sfspo, helix-c and helix-i are not conserved. helix-c had the amino acid sequence of h/yxxpr, and the amino acid sequence of helix-i was gghsa/v .

in insects, spo belongs to cyp <dig> family. the n-terminus of sfspo has one of the common characters in microsomal p450s, consisting many hydrophobic residues followed by a proline/glycine  rich region .

temporal and spatial transcript profiles
at our experiment temperature, s. furcifera second-, third- and fourth-instar nymphs lasted an average of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  days. sfspo showed three expression peaks in day  <dig> of second-instar, day  <dig> of third-instar and day  <dig> of fourth-instar nymphs. in contrast, the expression levels were lower and formed three troughs in the newly-molted second-, third- and fourth-instar nymphs .

the spatial distribution of sfspo on day  <dig> of the fourth-instar nymphs was also tested using qpcr. sfspo clearly had a high transcript level in the thorax where pgs were located. moreover, trace amounts of transcripts were found in the head and abdomen .

dietary ingestion of dsrna on expression of sfspo and ecr genes
during 6 days of continuous exposure to dsrna-contained diet and 1 day after experiment, mrna abundance of sfspo in the surviving nymphs was examined by q-pcr. the mrna level of sfspo in treated nymphs respectively reduced by  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, comparing to that in dsegfp-exposed controls . this indicated that the rnai-mediated knockdown of sfspo was successful.

since sfspo is expected to act in other genes in the same signaling pathway, the possible effect of sfspo knockdown was examined on the transcript level of sfecr, which was one of 20e heterodimeric nuclear receptors and was regulated by 20e through a positive feedback loop directly  <cit>  or indirectly in d. melanogaster <cit> . as expected, during 6 days of continuous exposure to dsrna-contained diet and 1 day after experiment, sfecr expression levels in nymphs decreased by  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, when compared with that in dsegfp-ingested planthoppers .

effect of dsrna on nymph survival
six day ingestion of dsrna-contained diet caused nymphal lethality. the mortality reached up to 20% in nymphs that had ingested dssfspo. in most cases, nymphs died during the period of ecdysis. in contrast, less than 5% of the planthoppers on normal or egfp-dsrna-contained diets died .

effects of dsrna on nymph development
six day period of continuous exposure to dsrna-contained diet significantly delayed nymphal development. 100% of the nymphs on normal and egfp-dsrna-contained diets became the fourth instars after experiment. in contrast, 24% of the individuals on sfspo-dsrna-contained diets remained in the third-instar .

rescue experiment
application of 300 pg of 20e did not affect the expression level of sfspo. in contrast, 20e application almost completely rescued sfecr expression at mrna level. moreover, 20e application to sfspo-dsrna-exposed nymphs almost completely overcame the negative effects on the survival and the development .

discussion
since the fundamental phenomena such as molting and metamorphosis are conserved during arthropod evolution, the halloween genes are expected to be well conserved in insects  <cit> , and in other arthropods  <cit> . in the present paper, the presence of sfspo was demonstrated in s. furcifera. the primary structure of sfspo has three insect conserved p <dig> motifs, i.e., helix-k, perf and heme-binding motifs. similar structural characters have been documented in spo- and spok-like proteins from other insect species of diverse orders such as diptera  <cit> , coleoptera  <cit> , hymenoptera  <cit> , lepidoptera  <cit> , orthoptera  <cit> , and hemiptera  <cit> . the n-terminus of sfspo has one of the common characters in microsomal p450s, consisting many hydrophobic residues followed by a proline/glycine  rich region. consistent with the structural features, spo is detected in endoplasmic reticulum  when the corresponding gene is transfected to drosophila s <dig> cells  <cit> . moreover, sfspo showed three expression peaks in late second-, third- and fourth-instar stages. in contrast, the expression levels were lower and formed three troughs in the newly-molted second-, third- and fourth-instar nymphs. in the fourth-instar nymphs of the brown planthopper n. lugens <cit>  and in the sixth-instar larvae of a lepidopteran species s. littoralis, the level of ecdysteroid showed a peak in the later instar stage. in d. melanogaster larval stage, expression patterns of dmspo gene undergoes dramatic fluctuations, consistent with circulating ecdysteroid quantity in the haemolymph: being high in late seconds, low in early third and high in late thirds  <cit> . furthermore, we found in this study that sfspo clearly had a high transcript level in the thorax where pgs were located. similarly, dmspo is expressed primarily in the pg cells of the ring gland in larval and adult stages  <cit> . thus, the structural features and temporal and spatial expression patterns suggest that sfspo might be involved in the ecdysteroidogenesis in s. furcifera.

the suggestion is further confirmed by three lines of experimental evidence in the present paper. firstly, rnai-mediated knockdown of sfspo in s. furcifera reduced the expression level of sfecr at the mrna level. in other insect species, mutations in or rnai against the halloween enzymes caused a decrease in ecdysteroid titers  <cit> . moreover, the expression of ecr gene was regulated by ecdysteroids through a positive feedback loop in d. melanogaster <cit> . accordingly, it can be hypothesized that rnai-mediated knockdown of sfspo negatively affects ecdysteroidogenesis in s. furcifera, and subsequently down-regulated sfecr expression in s. furcifera. consistent with the hypothesis, our rescue experiment revealed that 20e application almost completely rescued sfecr expression in nymphs that had ingested dssfcyp307a <dig> 

the second line of experimental evidence is that rnai-mediated knockdown of sfspo in s. furcifera caused phenotypic defects similar to insects whose ecdysteroid synthesis was disturbed or whose ecdysteroid-mediated signaling had been inhibited  <cit> . in the present paper, we found that ingestion of dssfspo caused nymphal lethality and developmental delay. since the average second- and third-instar periods of the nymphs in our experimental conditions was respectively about 2 days and the deaths mainly occurred in the sixth day after dsrna exposure, it means that the nymphs died during the third ecdysis. in fact, we also observed many abnormal and lethal ecdysis individuals on sfspo-dsrna contained diet, whereas most of the larvae on control normally molted. similar phenomena have been observed in other two rice planthoppers, l. striatellus and n. lugens, in which silencing of ecr expression by in vivo rnai to inhibit ecdysteroid-mediated signaling generated phenotypic defects in molting and resulted in lethality in most of the treated nymphs. intriguingly, apparent wing defects in morphogenesis and melanization occurred in l. striatellus nymphs subjected to dsecr microinjection  <cit> .

it has long been known that topical application of 20e could trigger physiological response such as regulation of diapause in the fourth-instar planthopper nymphs  <cit> . in the present paper, we tested whether 20e could rescue the negative effects of sfspo-dsrna ingestion on nymphs. our results revealed that 20e application to sfspo-dsrna-exposed nymphs almost completely relieved the negative effects on the survival and the development. thus, we provided the third line of evidence to support the suggestion that sfspo plays critical roles in ecdysteroidogenesis in s. furcifera.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present paper, we cloned sfspo and found that the conservation of sfspo is valid in s. furcifera. thus, sfspo is probably also involved in ecdysteroidogenesis for hemiptera.
