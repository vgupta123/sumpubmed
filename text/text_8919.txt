BACKGROUND
small-noncoding-rna guided gene regulation is a well-established and important branch of gene regulation. with the advent of high throughput sequencing coupled with functional studies a variety of small noncoding rnas has been identified including piwi-interacting rnas . pirnas interact with piwi-family proteins and are processed by a dicer-independent mechanism  <cit> . they are predominantly expressed in germline cells where they mainly act to silence transposable elements   <cit> . by guiding piwi proteins to complementary target sequences for cleavage pirnas help to maintain genome integrity and their function has been well conserved throughout the animal tree of life . a role of pirnas in the conservation of the germ cell epigenomes has been postulated  <cit> , further, evidence suggests that pirnas play a role in stem-cell function, whole-body regeneration and cancer  <cit> . pirnas are generated from long precursor rnas so called clusters, which can be up to 100 kb long, they are strongly enriched in repetitive sequences and normally encompass multiple transposon sequences  <cit> . biogenesis of pirna occurs by two highly conserved pathways; primary processing and secondary pathways.  <cit> . during primary biogenesis pirna clusters are transcribed and loaded onto the argonaute family protein piwi to be further processed into primary pirnas. other proteins that are involved in primary pirna biogenesis in d. melanogaster are tudor-domain-containing proteins, which directly  <cit>  interact with piwi, which is necessary for the assembly of other proteins essential for the piwi pathway  <cit> . in the secondary pathway, specific pirnas targeting tes are amplified in a loop, known as the “ping-pong cycle”  <cit> . in contrast to other rnas, pirnas contain a 2’-o-methylated 3’ terminus which protects them from degradation, e.g. by naio4-mediated oxidation  <cit> . a systematic comparative analysis on different teleost fish genomes suggests that the pirna biogenesis pathway is likely to be involved in the adaptation to transposon diversity  <cit> . in particular, fish genomes show a much greater diversity of transposable elements than other vertebrates  <cit> .

in addition to their function in germline cells, it is emerging that pirnas might also play a role in various somatic cell cancers. recent studies have clearly demonstrated aberrant expression of piwi proteins and pirnas in variety of cancers . however, almost nothing is known about a role of pirnas in the development of melanoma. small laboratory fish are generally accepted and increasingly used models for a better understanding of the molecular basis of melanoma formation . they also provide many experimental advantages for high throughput drug screening and detection of novel melanoma molecules and tumor markers. we use a natural, so-called evolutionary model of spontaneous melanoma formation in hybrids of platyfish  and swordtails   and a transgenic model in medaka , where fish expressing the xmrk oncogene from platyfish under the pigment cell specific mitf promoter of medaka develop various types of melanoma  <cit>  . the pigment cell tumors of both models have previously been shown to be comparable to human melanoma on the levels of proteins, mrnas and they share many features with these malignancies  <cit> . in this study, we sequenced small rnas of testes, ovary, tumor and benign control samples to investigate the role of pirnas in different melanoma entities of our fish models.fig.  <dig> pigment cell tumor developing fish as used in this study. upper: mitf:xmrk transgenic medaka with exophytic xanthoerythrophoroma , lower: xiphophorus hybrid with malignant melanoma



RESULTS
construction of a pirna cluster reference set for xiphophorus and medaka
so far, pirna reference data only exist for a few organisms. because pirnas are very poorly conserved, we first had to construct a reference dataset for xiphophorus and medaka . therefore, we mapped sequences of oxidized small rna samples of testes of both fish, which should contain only pirnas protected by 3’ end 2’-o-methylation, to the respective genomes and the hits were merged . sequencing with the illumina highseq™ system produced  <dig> clean reads for oxidized samples of medaka and xiphophorus . percentage of clean sequences was between  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the total reads. in medaka 28 % and in xiphophorus 39 % of the pirnas were sequenced with fewer than  <dig> reads and these extremely low expressed sequences were removed. to confirm the efficacy of the oxidation procedure, two putative pirna cluster loci, u <dig> rna and the mirnas mir-20a <dig>  mir-27a, mir- <dig> were tested by qpcr, comparing rna from the samples before and after oxidation. u <dig> and all mirnas showed a strong reduction in abundance. in contrast, both pirna clusters showed almost no change , indicating that only pirna was protected from degradation during oxidation. this conclusion was supported by the length distribution of the sequences remaining after oxidation with a clear peak at 28 nt . to obtain a preliminary reference oxidized testis samples were mapped to the respective genome and the hits were merged. with a spacing of 1 kb this procedure resulted in  <dig> unique clusters for medaka and  <dig> unique clusters for xiphophorus. to reduce the risk of contamination with remnants of other rnas, which may be present in somatic tissues as well as in germline cells, the non-oxidized samples were filtered  and then mapped to the preliminary reference. after excluding unreliable clusters the final reference consisted of  <dig> separate clusters with an average length of 2099 nt for medaka and  <dig> separate clusters with an average length of 579 nt for xiphophorus. this high number of clusters resulted from the extremely small spacing of 1 kb that we allowed between two consecutive pirnas.fig.  <dig> abundance of rna before oxidation  and after oxidation  of smallrna relative u <dig> as control, mir-20a <dig>  mir27a, mir- <dig> and two pirnas, tested by qpcr. after oxidation a strong reduction of mirnas, but no decrease of the amount of pirnas can be observed, confirming the efficacy of the oxidation procedure



to verify that no micrornas contaminate our reference datasets, we blasted the reference sequences to known micrornas from mirbase. no regions overlapping mirnas were detected in either species. in contrast,  <dig>  % of the medaka reference sequences had blast hits to known fish tes . of the xiphophorus reference,  <dig>  % of the sequences had blast hits to known fish tes. most pirnas were present in ovary of both medaka and xiphophorus, but at lower levels than in testes, like in zebrafish  <cit> .

transposable elements  in medaka and xiphophorus
our te library contained  <dig> tes for xiphophorus and  <dig> tes for medaka. out of these,  <dig> tes had a blast hit on the xiphophorus pirna reference and  <dig> tes had a blast hit on the medaka pirna reference. comparing the proportions of te classes of all known tes with the te classes with blast hits on the pirna reference we found in xiphophorus an enrichment of line and sine elements. the number of unknown tes was reduced primarily in pirna clusters present in both testis and somatic cells  , the number of pirna sequences with similarity to dna tes was reduced in pirna clusters found in testis only. in medaka, however, there was a significant enrichment of pirna clusters with blast hits to dna tes and, like in xiphophorus, a reduction of unknown tes in somatic cells  . of note, there are about twice as many dna tes known in xiphophorus than in medaka.fig.  <dig> barplot of proportions of te classes present in medaka  or xiphophorus . medaka: pirna reference set , in both somatic tissue and testis  and in testis only  in comparison to all known medaka tes . dna tes are significantly up-regulated in the reference and in pirna clusters that are present in both somatic cells and testis, whereas the group comprising unknown tes is significantly down-regulated in the soma and testis and testis only. xiphophorus: pirna reference set , in both somatic tissue and testis  and in testis only  in comparison to all known xiphophorus tes . lines and sines are significantly up-regulated in all data sets, whereas the group comprising dna tes is significantly down-regulated in testis. unknown tes are significantly down-regulated in the reference set and in the group of pirna clusters present in soma and testis. * p.value < <dig> , ** p.value <  <dig> 



differing base preference at the first position of pirnas between germline cells and somatic cells
due to processing, pirna sequences have a preference of uridine at the first position and adenine at the 10th position  <cit> . looking at the base distribution of the oxidized small rnas with hits on the references, we found a significant bias towards uridine at the first position  and adenine at the 10th position  in medaka , which is in in agreement with other studies  <cit> . base distribution at the first position of putative pirnas from ovary and testis was similar to the oxidized samples from both fish species . also healthy skin from fins was more similar to the oxidized rna from testis than to the control sample. to define a preference for either the primary or secondary processing pathway of pirnas we calculated the primary/secondary pathway ratio as described in aravin et al.  <cit> . according to the base preference during pirna processing, pirnas derived from the primary pathway are defined as having uridine at position  <dig> but no adenine at position  <dig> . pirnas processed in the secondary pathway are defined as having any base but uridine at position  <dig> and adenine at position  <dig>  in addition, because some of the samples showed a clear preference for guanine at position  <dig> or  <dig>  we calculated a ratio with 10g in the same way. all other sequences, were excluded. ratios 1u/10a were significantly higher in germline cells, indicating that there is a higher proportion of pirnas processed in the secondary pathway in the somatic cells than in germline cells. this bias was even more obvious for 1u/10g .

in medaka  less aggressive tumor samples had a bias towards guanine at the first position in pirna sequences. tumors and hp did not have a large bias. only um and im, which are the most aggressive melanoma types, showed a bias to uridine at the first position , albeit not as clearly as in germ line cells. in xiphophorus pirnas at position  <dig> had a bias to guanine at position  <dig>  in all samples except ovary .

piwi and tudor proteins are expressed in medaka melanomas
to investigate, how somatic tissues of medaka express piwil <dig>  piwil <dig> and tudor, the enzymes involved in the primary processing pathway of pirnas, we determined the expression levels in hp and different types of pigment cell lesions and tumors by qpcr . in comparison to hp piwil <dig> was significantly upregulated in im, which is a more aggressive form of skin cancer. in less malignant melanoma subtypes piwil <dig> showed only low levels of expression . in contrast, piwil <dig> was up-regulated in xe and im with the highest median expression levels in im . tudor tends to be upregulated in xe, fm and im .fig.  <dig> boxplots of the abundance of piwil <dig> a, piwil <dig> b and tudor c measured by qpcr. in comparison to hp piwil <dig> and tudor are enriched in uveal melanoma  and invasive melanoma . piwil <dig> is enriched in xanthoerythrophoroma  and im. all values are expressed relative to ef1a as reference



expression of pirna clusters in melanoma
having shown that pigment cell tumors indeed express piwil <dig>  piwil <dig> and tudor, the next step was to look for the presence of pirna in these samples. therefore, we sequenced the small rna fraction of several melanoma types, premalignant lesions and testes and ovaries. analysis resulted in approx.  <dig> * <dig> clean reads for somatic tissue samples and 3* <dig>  clean reads for testis and ovary. subsequently, small rna sequences were filtered  and mapped to the respective final reference. all sequences that did not map to the reference were excluded.

medaka
in total we found  <dig> clusters that were expressed in testis only.  <dig> clusters were expressed in tumor samples and hyperpigmented skin as the non-malignant control. comparing the expression of malignant versus benign control tissue, in medaka  <dig>  of the clusters were down-regulated more than 4-fold in im as compared to hp and  <dig>  were up-regulated. correspondence analysis  clearly distinguished between non-malignant and malignant samples . in heatmaps of pirna clusters with a fold change >  <dig> and a p.value <  <dig>  for the comparison of hp vs. im, most of the clusters were up-regulated in im. however, there was a group of clusters which was also up-regulated in im but even higher in normal skin .fig.  <dig> correspondence analysis  of tumor and control samples of medaka. a associated eigenvalues, with the relative high second bar indicating that there is still meaningful information in the second component . b on axis <dig>  less aggressive lesions, xanthoerythrophoroma , fin melanoma  and hyperpigmented skin  are clustered together and are clearly separated from uveal melanoma , which is a high-grade malignant melanoma. invasive melanoma  is separated by the second component from all other samples

xiphophorus
calculating the distribution of clusters within samples showed that xiphophorus had  <dig> clusters that were expressed exclusively in testis. differential expression between tumor samples and hyperpigmented skin as the non-malignant reference was calculated for the pirna clusters expressed in both testis and somatic cells . comparing the expression of malignant versus benign control tissue,  <dig>  of the clusters were down-regulated more than 4-fold but only  <dig>  of the clusters were up-regulated in the malignant tissue samples. in xiphophorus almost all clusters that were differentially regulated between benign and malignant tissue had higher expression levels in skin than in other somatic tissues and thus show more similarity to germline cells .

confirmation of pirna regulation and detection of putative target in medaka
to confirm the differential expression of pirna clusters on a larger melanoma sample set, we selected three pirnas and validated their expression by qpcr . pirna <dig> was slightly down-regulated in all tumors. pirna <dig> was up-regulated in fm, um and im in comparison to hp and pirna <dig> was down-regulated in fm. based on qpcr results of these three pirnas it is possible to differentiate between low-grade malignant tumors  and hp and high-grade malignant tumors  which cluster with pirnas from testes . next, putative target genes were determined using rnahybrid. targets for pirna1- <dig> are listed in additional file 6: table s <dig>  it is noticeable that, when comparing these putative targets with the gene expression data of an earlier study  <cit>  a significantly  higher percentage was down-regulated than up-regulated more than 2-fold . in contrast, genes with a maximal distance of 10 kb to pirna clusters tend to be more up-regulated fold . in the complete dataset about the same number of genes was up- regulated and down-regulated. functional analysis of the targets using david revealed many genes involved in purine ribonucleotide and atp binding.fig.  <dig> boxplots of the abundance relative to u <dig> for selected pirnas . the grey line indicating the median hp value

fig.  <dig> dendrogram, based on the abundance relative to u <dig> of the selected pirnas. using only these three pirnas it is possible to separate low malignant tumors  and hp from high malignant tumors  and testes. skin, oxidized testis and ovary are clustered in one distinctly separated group



comparison of pirnas between medaka and xiphophorus
in medaka 20 % of the reference pirna sequences mapped to  <dig> unique genes, while in xiphophorus only 2 % of the reference pirna sequences mapped to  <dig> unique genes,  <dig> of these genes were found in both fish. in this common gene set pathways involving among others apoptosis and ‘glycine, serine and threonine metabolism’ were enriched. gene ontology  analysis also revealed an enrichment of genes related to the categories ‘response to endoplasmic stress’and ‘nucleobase biosynthetic process’ . comparing xiphophorus and medaka reference clusters by blast  resulted in  <dig> hits with an alignment length between  <dig> to  <dig> bases. interestingly, there was a discrepancy between the number of unique hits for xiphophorus  and medaka . thus, many clusters in xiphophorus had various matching members in medaka, but only a few medaka clusters corresponded to more than one sequence in platyfish. these sequences did not overlap with human sequences, yet, comparing gene names resulted in an overlap of  <dig> genes , which were significantly enriched in purine ribonucleotide and atp binding.

discussion
in this study we explored pirnas of medaka and xiphophorus and found different expression patterns in germline cells, different melanoma types and healthy skin.

prior to developing our own pirna clustering pipeline we tested two already publicly available tools, protrac  <cit>  and piclust  <cit> . we excluded piclust, because of the restriction to selected genomes, file size and the limited number of multiple mapping sites per read. using our dataset protrac resulted only in a very small number of results, most likely because protrac includes typical pirna and pirna cluster characteristics such as the number of loci with a t at position  <dig> or a at position  <dig>  even though piwi-like and argonaute-like protein  <dig>  are present in both fish, ago <dig> is not well conserved, so we did not want to assume a certain nucleotide distribution. because we are working with fish genera in which pirnas have not been studied before, we wanted to be sure that presumptions based on other model organisms did not lead to false negative results and therefore decided to develop our own pipeline. to our knowledge, no commonly accepted rules yet exist to computationally define pirna clusters in fish. additionally, the number of clusters found in different organisms is extremely variable, likely due to the heterogeneity of individual sequences and the poor conservation of clusters among species. for example the pirna bank  contains  <dig> entries for human,  <dig> for mouse and  <dig> cluster entries for zebrafish. due to this disparity pirnas from other eukaryotes sequences could not serve as a guideline. to overcome these problems, we oxidized and subsequently sequenced small rna from testes of both fish. we verified that oxidation is indeed an efficient method to enrich small rnas preparations for pirnas and exclude other small rna types. in addition, to eliminate remainders of any other types of rna and pirna clusters expressed at very low levels, sequences were prefiltered based on known datasets for ncrna and for simple repeats. because we focused on the role of pirnas in the development of melanoma, we chose an extremely short distance between two pirna sequences to be sure to still have a good resolution to find differentially expressed clusters. on the other hand we did not want to keep a large number of redundant separate sequences and so we condensed data as much as possible without introducing errors from over condensing. by finding  <dig> clusters on  <dig> different genome scaffolds for medaka and  <dig> clusters on  <dig> genomic scaffolds for xiphophorus, our reference sets contain many more clusters than have been found in for example zebrafish. however, with greater spacing differences in pirna cluster expression intensity tend to be underestimated and expression differences of smaller pirna sequence might be averaged. previous attempts with a larger spacing showed a too low resolution to reliably find differentially expressed pirna clusters . our data showed that highly expressed pirnas tend to be clustered. changing the criterion for defining a cluster from 1 kb to 10 kb would result in  <dig> clusters for medaka and  <dig> clusters for xiphophorus. the high number of clusters for xiphophorus with a 10 kb spacing can be caused by an almost 3x higher number of genomic scaffolds and a  <dig> x shorter scaffold n <dig> in the xiphophorus genome compared to medaka.

regarding the base distribution of sample sequences, medaka has a bias toward 1u and 10a in the sequences of germline cells as described by other studies  <cit> . our sequence data showed that somatic cells of medaka have a bias towards guanine at position  <dig> and toward uridine at position  <dig>  this bias might partly be explained by the preferential usage of either piwil <dig> or piwil <dig> in these tumor types as indicated by qpcr . further, calculating the ratio 1u/10a as a measure for the preference of one or the other biogenesis pathways  <cit>  indicates that the secondary pathway generates most pirnas in somatic cells. this apparent pathway bias is in line with the higher number of pirnas expressed in somatic cells than pirnas expressed in testis only .table  <dig> percentage of sequences mapping to a known transposable element 


xiphophorus


direct comparison of medaka and xiphophorus pirna clusters showed that more xiphophorus clusters had positive blast hits to medaka than vice versa. these and other features that are different between the pirna dataset from the two melanoma fish models may be due to the fact that the medaka melanoma model is a transgenic model where tumors develop on a purebred, rather homogenous wildtype background, while in the xiphophorus model, the tumors develop on an interspecific hybrid genetic background. in several studies pirna origin has been linked to transposons  <cit> . in a hybrid genome tes can be activated  <cit>  and influence pirna clusters. it has been shown that there is a great variability of te content and type in different fish  <cit> , which can explain the diversity of the pirna cluster sequences in our two models.

to compare genes overlapping with fish and human pirna clusters, human pirna sequences we also merged with an inter-pirna maximum distance of 1 kb, which resulted in  <dig> clusters. this increase in pirna clusters from  <dig> to  <dig> corresponds to about the same rate as for medaka. comparable to the results in other organisms  <cit> , we found only poor conservation between xiphophorus and medaka reference sequences and none of these cluster sequences were found to be conserved in human  <cit> .: the  <dig> fish genes with overlap to pirna clusters that are also found in the human genome may be underestimated, because the list is limited to known homologs from the ensembl database. in our list 79 % of xiphophorus protein-coding genes and 74 % of medaka protein-coding genes have human homologs.

we decided to use hyperpigmented skin in medaka and benign melanoma in xiphophorus, which is comparable to hp, as controls, because healthy skin as control did not seem to be useful for normalization, because samples of healthy skin from caudal fins in medaka and dorsal fins in xiphophorus tended to show an expression pattern with higher pirna levels, somewhat more similar to germline cells . this is consistent with a previous study, where pirna from embryonic stem cells  and human skin had higher expression levels than samples from human saliva  <cit> .

our dataset showed overexpression of piwi genes, and the same result is frequently found in human cancers  <cit> , the murine piwi/ago gene subfamily mili has been found to be able to methylate line <dig>  which is crucial for the expression of melanoma antigen family a   <cit>  and thus for tumor progression. we found that some pirna clusters are down-regulated and others are up-regulated in tumor cells. both up-regulation and down-regulation of pirna biogenesis has been linked previously to several cancers such as breast cancer  <cit> , pancreatic cancer  <cit>  or bladder cancer  <cit> . down-regulation of human pirna- <dig> has been observed to promote gastric cancer  <cit> . furthermore, pirna expression can not only distinguish between tumors and non-malignant tissue, but also delineate clinical features, such as histological subgroups, disease stages and survival  <cit> . piwil <dig> , <dig> and piwil <dig> have been found to be mutated in skin cancer  <cit> . human pirna_ <dig> was shown to negatively regulate the human melatonin receptor 1a gene, which is expressed in adult human testes and brain  <cit> . a possible role of pirnas and piwi proteins as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers has been discussed  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of pirnas in melanoma at all. in previous studies we showed that in xiphophorus tx- <dig>  an active ltr-containing retrotransposon, causes a disruption of the xmrk oncogene and thus repressed tumor formation  <cit> . a causal relationship between tes and cancer has also been discussed by others  <cit> . our results suggest that certain pirnas are differentially regulated in more aggressive melanoma subtypes compared to hyperpigmented skin. functional studies in fish melanoma cell lines, by modulating pirna levels and observing phenotypic changes will have to be conducted to further elucidate the role of pirnas in melanomagenesis and can be followed up by functional studies in-vivo including manipulation of expression of pirna biogenesis proteins and levels of selected pirnas in fish melanoma.
