BACKGROUND
hepatitis c virus  which belongs to the family flaviviridae, causes chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in humans
 <cit> . non-structural protein 5a  of hcv is involved in regulating hcv rna replication
 <cit>  and evading the interferon induced antiviral response
 <cit>  by interacting with human protein kinases as the viral genome does not encode any kinase
 <cit> .

structural information of ns5a at atomic level is known only for the n terminal part of the protein. residues 5– <dig> of ns5a adopts α-helical conformation which is amphipathic and is embedded in a phospholipid bilayer on one side and the other side has conserved polar residues
 <cit> . residues 36– <dig> of ns5a adopt a novel zinc coordination motif which forms a homodimer and is organized into different forms to perform different roles such as viral replication and viral assembly
 <cit> . both the regions of ns5a have been shown to be critical for viral replication
 <cit> . experimental work have shown that for the rest of the protein whose structure is currently unknown it is natively unfolded
 <cit> , lacks secondary structural elements, is less hydrophobic, has high content of positively charged residues, has low complexity regions and many phosphorylation sites which predominantly occurs in intrinsically disordered regions of the protein
 <cit> . due to these attributes, ns5a which is natively unfolded, attains a stable structural form when it is bound with a protein. the natively unfolded nature of ns5a makes it capable of interacting with many human as well other non-structural proteins of hcv thereby carrying out multiple functions
 <cit> .

ns5a interacts with different human kinases namely, casein kinase 1α 
 <cit>  and protein kinase r 
 <cit> . in the present study, the critical kinase and ns5a residues involved in interaction have been predicted by protein structure modeling and sequence analysis.

the casein kinase 1α – ns5a interaction forms a transient enzyme-substrate complex
 <cit> . several amino acids in ns5a get phosphorylated by different human kinases
 <cit> . varying levels of ns5a phosphorylation modulates its interaction with host and other viral proteins during viral replication
 <cit> . phosphorylation of ns5a serves as a regulatory switch between viral replication and rna translation and / or packaging
 <cit> . ns5a phosphorylation is observed among the flaviviridae family which points out its functional significance for the viral life cycle
 <cit> .

apart from the viral protein ns5a serving as a substrate to ck1α, one of the other substrate for ck1α is tumour suppressor p <dig> transactivation domain
 <cit> . dna virus induced stress to human cells leads to phosphorylation of serine  <dig> of p <dig> transactivation domain by ck1α. this phosphorylation enables the binding with a co-activator  and stimulates tumour suppressor p <dig> function
 <cit> .

casein kinase  <dig> is a serine / threonine protein kinase which is ubiquitously expressed in all the tissues and cellular compartments of eukaryotic organisms. human casein kinase  <dig> phosphorylates substrates which are involved in the control of cell differentiation, proliferation, chromosome segregation and circadian rhythm
 <cit> . the catalytic domain of casein kinase  <dig> is about  <dig> amino acids long. the catalytic domain of casein kinase  <dig> is made up of  <dig> lobes with a cleft between them for the substrate peptide to bind
 <cit> .

human ck <dig> shows high sequence identity to the other members of casein kinase  <dig> family
 <cit> . the crystal structure of casein kinase  <dig>  from schizosaccharomyces pombe, bound to atp
 <cit>  closely resembles both capk 
 <cit>  and cdk <dig> 
 <cit> , whose crystal structures have been solved along with substrate peptide and atp.

even though ns5a is phosphorylated at several residues by many human kinases
 <cit> , clear one-to-one mapping between phosphosite in ns5a and its corresponding human kinase is not completely known. however the human ck1α phosphorylating sites have been mapped to ser  <dig> of ns5a
 <cit>  and, therefore, phosphorylation by ck1α is the focus of the current study. in the present work, structural model of human ck1α bound to ns5a peptide of hcv containing the phophoacceptor serine  <dig> has been built using available crystal structures of other kinase-substrate/pseudosubstrate complexes. the aim of building the model of the complex is to understand the structural basis of the ns5a peptide recognition and identification of ns5a interacting ck1α residues. the analogy of ck1α – substrate recognition and interaction is also shown by considering the example of another substrate of ck1α - tumour suppressor p <dig> transactivation domain, whose crystal structure is known
 <cit> .

ns5a also interacts with another protein kinase pkr during the life cycle
 <cit> . ns5a does not get phosphorylated by pkr but only forms a protein-protein complex
 <cit> .

interferons lead to expression of ifn effector proteins like the double-stranded rna-activated protein kinase . during viral infection, pkr becomes activated upon viral dsrna binding, dimerisation and trans-autophosphorylation. pkr in its activated state phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig> , thereby inhibiting cellular protein synthesis and blocking viral replication
 <cit> .

in the recent past, triple therapy, which includes pegylated interferon along with ribavirin and a hcv protease inhibitor, has shown promising results with high rates of sustained virological response compared to other treatments currently available
 <cit> . combined pegylated interferon, ribavirin therapy provides ~45-50% sustained virological response in genotype- <dig> infected patients
 <cit>  while when interferon alone is administered only ~30% of genotype  <dig> infected patients seem to respond to the therapy
 <cit> . this is mainly because a region in ns5a  interacts with pkr , thereby preventing pkr dimer formation and activation
 <cit> . additionally, another region in ns5a, referred as the variable-region  <dig>   is located downstream to isdr which is also involved in the interaction and inhibition of pkr
 <cit> . interestingly, more than 60% of genotype  <dig> and  <dig> patients respond well to the interferon therapy. one of the reasons for this is that ns5a 2a/3a are unable to bind and inhibit pkr efficiently
 <cit> .

an attempt has been made to narrow down the region in ns5a and predict critical residues in ns5a 1b responsible for interaction with pkr by two independent approaches. firstly, due to putative shared binding region of ns5a 1b and pkr protomer with another pkr protomer
 <cit> , one can hypothesize that structural features of pkr dimer interface and pkr interacting region in ns5a 1b would be similar. the unstructured region of ns5a 1b
 <cit>  could attain a stable structural form and have similar binding surface like that of pkr protomer as it binds to the other pkr protomer. some of the critical pkr interacting residues of ns5a has been identified using this approach.

further, as the binding of ns5a with pkr is primarily genotype specific
 <cit> , evolutionary trace analysis
 <cit>  has been used to identify amino acid residues in ns5a specific for genotype  <dig> that interacts with pkr and residues in ns5a specific to genotype 2a and 3a which is potentially incapable of binding and inhibiting pkr efficiently.

details of the ns5a and human kinase interacting residues shown in this study can provide insights to design antivirals to inhibit these interactions.

RESULTS
homology modeling of human casein kinase 1α
casein kinase  <dig> from schizosaccharomyces pombe, for which a crystal structure is available in complex with mgatp at 2Å resolution 
 <cit> , showed  <dig> % sequence identity with the sequence of human ck1α. casein kinase  <dig> from schizosaccharomyces pombe can be considered as a best template, as the kinase is in the active conformation so that the substrate is accessible to get phosphorylated by the kinase. the homology model of the kinase domain of ck1α is shown in figure
 <dig> 
 <cit> .

an insertion region  away from critical sites of kinase and the substrate interacting region has not been modeled due to potentially poor reliability of the modeled conformation. these inserts are unlikely to have any influence on the substrate binding.

the sequence of human ck1α can be accommodated comfortably in the bilobal structure which is common to all ser/thr/tyr protein kinases
 <cit> . it is ensured that all the expected features such as presence of nucleotide binding site in the smaller lobe and the characteristic glycine-rich atp binding loop  are present in the model at the correct positions in the 3-d structure.

modelling of ns5a peptide bound to human casein kinase 1α model
protein kinases recognize their substrates usually by means of a substrate recognition motif surrounding the phosphoacceptor residue
 <cit> . substrates of casein kinase  <dig> have asp/glu or a phosphorylated amino acid residue located three residues upstream of phosphoacceptor serine and this residue is termed as the substrate constraint residue
 <cit> . ck1α phosphorylates ns5a which contains the substrate constraint residue phosphoserine at the position  <dig>  this residue is three residues upstream to ser  <dig> targeted for phosphorylation by ck1α thus defining a substrate recognition motif of -s-x-x-s, where x refers to any amino acid and s refers to phosphoserine
 <cit> . the substrate sequence motif for camp dependent kinase  is r-r/k-x-s where s at the fourth position is the target site for phosphorylation
 <cit> . it must be noted that both in ck1α and camp kinase, substrate specificity sequence pattern constraints are imposed in first and fourth positions of the motif. given the conserved nature of catalytic and atp anchoring residues in the 3-d structures of camp and ck1α, it is expected that phospho acceptor site and the residue two positions upstream to the phosphor-acceptor site are oriented in the similar way with respect to their respective kinases. this leaves little scope for the variation in the backbone conformation between the first and fourth residue positions of the two substrates. therefore, ns5a peptide ssas has been modeled on to the structural model of ck1α which was generated based on the crystal structure of camp dependent kinase – peptide inhibitor  complex 
 <cit> . . hence the conformation of ns5a peptide is based on the conformation of peptide inhibitor of camp dependent kinase.

the modeled complex of ns5a peptide bound to ck1α revealed that the phosphoserine is close to asp  <dig> , which is unfavourable due to the proximity of two strongly negative charges. multiple sequence alignment  among the casein kinase  <dig> family also revealed that the asp is conservatively substituted to glu as shown in the additional file
 <dig>  therefore it was inferred that the conformation of side chain of phosphoserine is unlikely to be similar to that of arg in "equivalent position" of camp dependent kinase
 <cit> . the conformation of side chain of phosphoserine was modelled in such a way that the negatively charged phosphoserine can make favourable ionic interactions with positively charged residues in the vicinity.
 <dig> 

from the modeled complex structure, the positively charged residues in close vicinity to phosphoserine were found to be side chains of arginine  <dig>  lysine  <dig> and main chain nitrogen of glycine  <dig> which are capable of making ionic interactions as shown in figure
 <dig>  these residues are critical for the proper positioning of the hcv ns5a for the phosphorylation to occur at ser  <dig> 

multiple sequence alignment was used to check the structural importance of these residues within the casein kinase  <dig> family, as shown in the additional file
 <dig>  arginine is completely conserved across the casein kinase  <dig> family. lysine is conservatively substituted to arginine across the casein kinase  <dig> family. the glycine does not show absolute conservation, but this does not affect its interaction with phosphoserine because it is the main chain nitrogen that is involved in the interaction. previous crystal structure studies of casein kinase  <dig> from schizosaccharomyces pombe used sulphate anion that can mimic the binding of a phospho amino acid. the authors proposed that arginine  <dig>  lysine  <dig> and glycine  <dig> are substrate interacting residues
 <cit> . these residues are found to be topologically equivalent to the residues that had been identified in the model as substrate interacting residues as shown in the figure
 <dig>  sequence alignment between casein kinase  <dig> from schizosaccharomyces pombe and human ck1α and structure alignment of casein kinase  <dig> from schizosaccharomyces pombe 
 <cit>  and camp dependent kinase 
 <cit>  is shown in the figure
 <dig> 
 <cit>  between camp dependent kinase 
 <cit>  and yeast casein kinase 
 <cit>  shows that the critical residues which are highlighted in blue are topologically equivalent. the substrate interacting residues in ck1α is highlighted in yellow and its structurally equivalent substrate interacting residues as proposed by the crystal structure study of yeast casein kinase  <dig> is highlighted in green. this figure was produced using joy
 <cit> . key to joy notation: solvent inaccessible - upper case ; solvent accessible - lower case ; positive φ - italic ; cispeptide – breve ; hydrogen bond to other side chain, tilde ; hydrogen bond to main chain amide, bold ;hydrogen bond to main chain carbonyl - underline ; disulphide bond, -cedila .

the conformation of ns5a motif s  sas as shown in the figure
 <dig>  would be functional irrespective of its entire tertiary structure context in the protein. the interactions shown in the modeled complex is likely to be identical when the structure of the entire ns5a is considered. this modeled complex has helped us to find out the substrate interacting residues in kinase with the substrate constraint residue phosphoserine which is common not only for ns5a but many other substrates of ck1α. however, it should be noted that the sequence specificity  of different kinases for phosphorylation is different. therefore, we believe that the modeled structure of ck1α -ns5a complex presented in our work cannot be assumed for interaction of other kinases with ns5a.

kinase inhibitors to prevent ns5a phosphorylation could severely affect the biological role of ck1α as it is involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, wnt signaling cascade for cell proliferation, differentiation and, deregulation of ck1α expression has been linked to alzheimer’s and parkinson’s disease
 <cit> .

other critical interactions specific to only ns5a and ck1α is not understood due to the unavailability of structural details of entire ns5a protein. a small molecule targeted to specifically bind to the suggested part of ns5a to prevent its interaction with ck1α could be very useful.

modeling of p <dig> transactivation domain bound to human casein kinase 1α
the crystal structure of p <dig> transactivation domain
 <cit>  contains the casein kinase  <dig> substrate consensus motif . the substrate consensus motif contains the phospho acceptor ser  <dig> and glutamic acid, the substrate constraint residue spaced three residues upstream to ser 20
 <cit> . this glutamic acid is equivalent to phosphoserine at position  <dig> in ns5a.

modeling of p <dig> transactivation domain  bound to ck1α showed the analogy of substrate recognition and interaction with ck1α. the substrate interacting residues arginine  <dig>  glycine  <dig> and lysine  <dig> makes ionic interactions with the substrate constraint residue glutamic acid  <dig> in the crystal structure of the transactivation domain of p <dig> tumour suppressor
 <cit>  as shown in the figure
 <dig> 
 <dig> 

this modeled complex shows identical interactions between the substrate interacting residues of kinase and the substrate constraint residues, which is common to all substrate - ck1α interaction. the other unique non-covalent interactions made by the p <dig> transactivation domain and kinase are listed in the table
 <dig> 

interactions observed in the modelled complex of p <dig> tumour suppressor transactivation domain
 <cit>  bound to ck1α model as shown in figure
 <dig> 

prediction of pkr interacting residues of ns5a
information derived from crystal structure of pkr dimer and pairwise sequence alignment of ns5a and pkr
crystal structure of pkr dimer 
 <cit>  was used to identify the interface residues listed in table
 <dig>  given a reasonable sequence similarity between isdr of ns5a 
 <cit>  and a stretch of interface in pkr dimeric interface 
 <cit>  we raise the possibility of structural mimicry between a local  region of ns5a and a local stretch  of pkr. this hypothesis is attractive especially because available experimental data suggests that isdr is potentially preventing dimerization of pkr
 <cit> . however, the gross similarity in the tertiary structures of pkr and ns5a is not implied.

the list of non-covalent interactions at the dimeric interface of pkr
 <cit>  has been obtained by using pic  server
 <cit> .

ns5a could have independently evolved the binding features of human pkr which is a mechanism commonly observed in viruses to evade the host system
 <cit> . this assumption is convincing to us because the structural constraint imposed by the binding pocket in the pkr protomer would make the natively unfolded region of ns5a
 <cit>  to flexibly adopt a structural region that could mimic the binding of pkr protomer.

however, the 3-d structure of ns5a is unlikely to be similar to the tertiary structure of pkr and also a previous study
 <cit>  showed that region of ns5a of current interest contains many unstructured regions.

a portion of ns5a isdr that could mimic the binding of a pkr protomer to other pkr protomer has been shown in the figure
 <dig> in the form of pairwise alignment. the dimer interface residues of pkr are marked in the alignment and the equivalent residues were checked in ns5a 1b sequence from the alignment. interestingly, it was found that the equivalent residues in ns5a 1b were mostly biochemically and structurally similar to the dimer interface residues in pkr, as shown in the figure
7; therefore they may be capable of making identical or similar interactions like pkr protomer. thus the residues in ns5a 1b equivalent to dimer interface residues of pkr were predicted as pkr interacting residues. they are ser  <dig>  asp  <dig>  thr  <dig>  val  <dig>  glu  <dig>  and phe  <dig> as shown in the table
 <dig> 
 <cit>  is coloured in green which is interacting with another pkr protomer coloured in magenta. the dimer interface residues are shown in stick representation. b: zoomed in view with labeled ns5a residues equivalent to the dimer interface residues as per the pairwise sequence alignment shown in figure
 <dig>  c: stereo representation of the image in figure
7b.

the equivalent residues in ns5a to the pkr dimer interface residues are obtained from the pairwise alignment as shown in the figure
 <dig>  the equivalent residues in ns5a which are capable of interacting with pkr mimics the binding of pkr protomer to the other pkr protomer due to the shared binding region of ns5a and pkr protomer with another pkr protomer
 <cit> .

the conservation of the predicted pkr interacting residues from all ns5a-1b sequences  was found to be above 90%. even though val  <dig> is similar to the dimer interface residue in the alignment, it was conserved below 80% and this position is highly variable with substitutions like i, p and m. so this position is not predicted as a pkr interacting residue.

it was further considered that the predicted pkr binding residues from genotype 1b would be different to those equivalent residues in genotype 2a and 3a which are unable to bind and inhibit pkr efficiently. multiple sequence alignment   shows different amino acids in genotype 3a and 2a equivalent to the predicted pkr interacting residues in genotype 1b.

prediction of pkr interacting residues of ns5a 1b by evolutionary trace analysis
we have also predicted the pkr interacting residues in ns5a of genotype 1b by a computational analysis which is entirely independent of the analysis reported in the previous section. experiments have shown that pkr interaction with ns5a is primarily genotype specific
 <cit> . ns5a from genotype 1b is able to efficiently interact and inhibit pkr
 <cit>  whereas ns5a from genotype 2a and 3a are unable to interact and inhibit pkr efficiently
 <cit> .

evolutionary trace analysis is based on the assumption that residues responsible for functional specificity could undergo many amino acid substitutions, which are responsible for variation in their function
 <cit> . the variation in the binding abilities of ns5a across genotypes with pkr can help us to predict the critical residues specific to ns5a 1b that could be involved in interaction with pkr. further evolutionary trace analysis could enable us to predict ns5a 2a, 3a specific residues which are unable to bind and inhibit pkr efficiently.

the residues unique to isdr of genotype 1b have been identified when the msa of genotype 1b was compared to msa of genotype 3a as shown in the additional file
 <dig>  analysis of v <dig> region of ns5a in the two genotypes showed a clear difference. as reported earlier there is an insertion within the v <dig> region
 <cit>  unique to all genotype 3a sequences and also few residues specific to genotype 3a different from genotype 1b. similar results were observed for genotype 1b versus genotype 2a as shown in the additional file
 <dig>  long insertion unique to both genotype 2a and 3a within the v <dig> region and residues unique to both genotype 2a, 3a collectively in isdr and v <dig> region differing from genotype 1b have been identified as shown in the additional file
 <dig> 

the list of evolutionary trace residues  picked up is provided in table
 <dig> along with the extent of amino-acid substitution across genotypes shown by means of blosum- <dig> score. all the trace residues show a high conservation of greater than 90% with very few residues showing greater than 80% conservation in the entire dataset .

trace residues are picked up if complete/ high conservation  or conservative substitution of two different residues or a residue and a gap from both multiple sequence alignment are being compared. the extent of amino acid substitution across genotypes in ns5a has been shown using blosum –  <dig> substitution score. the trace residues from ns5a genotype1b are predicted to be pkr interacting residues.

it is interesting to note that  <dig> out of the  <dig> residues  predicted to be pkr interacting residues in ns5a 1b by the method of aligning ns5a 1b and pkr, has also been picked by evolutionary trace analysis. this clearly shows the importance of these residues in binding to pkr.

these observations again emphasizes that both isdr as well as v <dig> region are involved in pkr inhibition which are primarily genotype specific as already shown by experimental studies
 <cit>  and which is reflected in form of trace residues in this study. the critical residues within isdr and v <dig> region involved in inhibition with pkr specific to only ns5a 1b have been identified for the first time by evolutionary trace analysis method. the striking common feature in genotypes 2a and 3a are the presence of the insertion of few residues within the v <dig> region that have been picked up as trace residues.

the finding from evolutionary trace analysis is consistent with the experiments done previously showing the importance of ns5a isdr and v <dig> region to bind to pkr
 <cit> .

v <dig> region in ns5a was found to be crucial for providing specificity to binding/ poor binding efficiency to pkr in the case of genotype 1b and genotype 2a/3a respectively
 <cit> . the large number of trace residues been picked up in v <dig> region as compared to isdr shows its importance and specificity for pkr binding. insertion within v <dig> that is commonly observed in genotype 3a and 2a could make ns5a unable to bind and inhibit pkr efficiently. it was found that isdr may not be critical for imparting specificity of binding to pkr
 <cit> . though isdr from genotype 1b is capable of interacting with pkr, its final interaction is solely dependent on the nature of v <dig> present
 <cit> . the pkr interacting residues in isdr picked in this analysis could be involved in stabilizing the protein-protein complex in case of genotype 1b with pkr.

it should be noted that not all the variable positions within ns5a 1b sequences may be completely responsible for their interaction with pkr. moreover ns5a has binding partners other than pkr
 <cit>  and neutral sequence evolution of various serotypes is also possible
 <cit> . nevertheless, it is attractive to hypothesize that sequence changes primarily in isdr in ns5a could be responsible for pkr interaction, as previous studies have shown the physical interaction between the isdr region of ns5a and pkr
 <cit> . therefore, mutagenesis experiments can be performed based on the predicted pkr interacting ns5a 1b residues to validate and filter them.

CONCLUSIONS
structural modeling has provided insights about the structural basis of interaction and recognition of ns5a peptide containing the phosphorylation motif with ck1α. this shows the viral mimicry of the substrate recognition motif for human ck1α. mutation of arg  <dig> and lys  <dig> which are predicted to interact with phosphorylated ser in ck1α could serve as an interesting validation of the model.

analogy of kinase recognition and substrate interaction is shown by considering another substrate of ck1α which is p <dig> tumour suppressor transactivation domain
 <cit>  whose crystal structure is known
 <cit> .the residues found to interact in ck1α with the substrate constraint residue are common in the viral protein hcv ns5a and human p <dig> tumour suppressor transactivation domain.

ns5a phosphorylation by ck1α serves as a regulatory switch between viral replication and rna translation/packaging
 <cit> . on the other hand, p <dig> phosphorylation at the transactivation domain by ck1α upon dna virus induced stress is also shown
 <cit> . it is well known that phosphorylated p <dig> triggers apoptosis in infected cells and serves as a host response during viral infection
 <cit> . interestingly, previous experiments have shown that ns5a binds and sequesters p <dig> transactivation domain and thereby prevents apoptosis to counteract the host response
 <cit> .

it is interesting to speculate that hcv infection could trigger phosphorylation of p <dig> by ck1α as a host response which gets counteracted by the hcv ns5a sequestering the p <dig> to prevent apoptosis
 <cit> .

thus, identification of residues in human ck1α which interacts with ns5a and p <dig> in this work could provide further insights to understand the interplay between ck1α and its two substrates  which could influence the outcome of the viral infection.

two different methods have been used to narrow down the range in ns5a which might interact with pkr. critical residues responsible for interaction of ns5a 1b with pkr and residues unable to bind and inhibit pkr efficiently in ns5a 2a/3a have been predicted for the first time. the functional significance and nature of interaction of isdr and v <dig> region in ns5a with pkr which was previously identified experimentally
 <cit>  are supported by evolutionary trace analysis.

even though the clinical response to interferon therapy has been studied for other hcv genotypes like  <dig>   <dig> and 6
 <cit> , the molecular interaction with pkr is not known. the findings of the evolutionary trace analysis can be compared to further predict if ns5a in these genotypes would interact with pkr and predict the pkr interacting residues in them.

recent work on evolution of pkr showed that each of its  <dig> domains evolve rapidly to evade the viruses. few residues within the dimerisation region of pkr have been shown to undergo positive selection
 <cit> . this could mean that these could be ns5a interacting residues in pkr that are under positive selection in order to overcome the interaction with the viral protein ns5a. this shows the “evolutionary arms race”
 <cit>  between the host protein pkr and the viral protein ns5a for their survival.

the information of interface residues in ns5a 1b and pkr would be very helpful to design inhibitors that would prevent this interaction to enable the hcv genotype  <dig> infected patients respond well to the interferon therapy like the other genotype infected patients of hcv.
