BACKGROUND
lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that specifically recognize diverse sugar structures and mediate a variety of biological processes  <cit> . lectin proteins contain at least one carbohydrate-binding domain. based on this, three major types of lectins are distinguished, namely merolectins, hololectins and chimerolectins  <cit> . the merolectins have only single carbohydrate-binding domain and the hololectins contain two or more domains which are either identical or very homologous. the chimerolectins are fusion proteins consisting of one or more carbohydrate-binding domains and unrelated domains. lectins are ubiquitous in nature, found in all kinds of organisms, from virus to humans  <cit> . plant lectins are usually considered as a very heterogeneous group of proteins because comparative biochemical studies clearly indicate that they differ from each other with respect to their biochemical/physicochemical properties, molecular structure, carbohydrate-binding specificity and biological activities  <cit> . therefore, it is difficult to find a widely acceptable way to classify plant lectins. currently, several attempts have been made to group plant lectins. one of them was based on the carbohydrate-binding specificity. as a result, mannose- mannose/glucose-, mannose/maltose-, gal/galnac, glcnac/n-, fucose- and salic acid-binding lectins have been distinguished , agglutinin with hevein domain, β-prism plant lectin, β-trefoil lectin, cyanovirin-n homolog and legume lectin http://www.cermav.cnrs.fr/lectines/. besides these, a more complicated classification system has been proposed which is based on either serological relationships or sequence similarities or both as well as their evolutionary relationships. based on such criterion,  <dig> lectin families have been classified including the legume lectins, the monocot mannose-binding lectins, the chitin-binding lectins, the type  <dig> rip and related lectins, jacalin-related lectins, amaranthin lectins and cucurbitaceae phloem lectins  <cit> . recently, these authors made an update of the system since many new plant lectins have been isolated and characterized  <cit> . they have classified plant lectins into  <dig> families and at least one member in each family has been characterized in some detail and we named this system as "system 1". these families are as follows: aba , amaranthin, cra , cyanovirin, eea , gna , hevein, jacalins, legume lectin, lysm , nictaba and ricin_b families. however, the classification system was based on the available plant lectin information and animal lectins were not used to explore lectin-like members in the plant genomes.

rapid progress has been achieved in genome sequencing with the great achievement in new sequencing technologies  <cit> . both arabidopsis and rice genomes have been completely sequenced  <cit>  as model plants for dicot and monocot plants, respectively. currently, soybean genome has also been completely sequenced . up to now, genomes from  <dig> eukaryotes,  <dig> bacterial and  <dig> archaeal have been completely sequenced and published and the sequencing for  <dig> eukaryotes,  <dig> bacterial and  <dig> archaeal genomes are in progress based on the genome online database v  <dig>  . all these data provide us additional information to further analyze the lectin superfamily in their molecular evolution, classification and biological functions. however, limited data has been reported on the genome-wide characterization and molecular evolution of this superfamily in plants. as a result, little is known on the outline of all lectin genes in a completely sequenced plant genome and no new classification system has been proposed on the basis of the whole genome sequence information.

on the other hand, another major question that one may concern is on the biological functions of plant lectins. many reviews or books have summarized the possible functions of plant lectins  <cit> . however, no definitive answers have been given. generally, plant lectins have both internal and external activities  <cit> . the former refers to the functions acting within the plants during various developmental processes such as interactions with storage proteins or enzymes  <cit> . the latter includes the roles of lectins in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses. evidence has shown the insecticidal activity of lectins against a spectrum of insects  <cit> . some of lectin genes could be used for improving plant tolerance/resistance to various insects by transgenic technology  <cit> . however, such a desired effect in crop protection was not observed in some cases  <cit> . the protection functions of lectins against other biotic stresses were also reported including fungi  <cit>  and virus  <cit> . plant lectins are not only assumed to be part of the defense system  <cit> , they have been also implicated as playing an important role in mediating recognition and specificity in the symbiosis with root nodule bacteria  <cit> . besides biotic stresses, plant lectins may also play roles in abiotic stresses  <cit> . reports have shown that several lectin genes exhibit differential expression abundance under various abiotic stresses including temperature shock, drought and high salinity stresses  <cit> .

since limited data is available on the genome-wide analysis of lectin genes, we do not know how many members of this family in a genome are involved in biotic and abiotic stress-related biological processes and how these genes have been expanded or evolved with such functions. in this report, we first identified and characterized all lectin genes encoded by the soybean, rice and arabidopsis genomes. we then proposed a new classification system on the basis of protein domain structures and phylogenetic analyses. we also evaluated their expansion mechanisms and evolutionary history by investigating their duplication and/or transposition history. subsequently, we examined their expression by full-length cdna, expression sequence tag , microarray and massively parallel signature sequencing  datasets. finally, we investigated their expression divergence under various stresses to further annotate their biological functions. our analyses advance the understanding of plant lectin genes as being involved in lineage-specific expansion, and that they function in biotic and abiotic stress-related developmental processes. we also identified putative new lectin genes which were not be experimentally detected at present in plant genomes and provided a new outline of the plant lectin gene superfamily.

RESULTS
genome-wide identification of the lectin superfamily in soybean, rice and arabidopsis
to survey lectin genes in legume plants, the soybean  genome was selected as it has been completely sequenced. to better understand their expansion history and expression divergence, two other genomes were also selected for comparative analyses including rice  and arabidopsis  genomes. we have used both blast and hidden markov model  searches  to identify lectin members presented in these genomes. after multiple cycles of searches, total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> putative lectin genes have been detected in soybean, rice and arabidopsis, respectively. these members were then subjected to the pfam  and smart  databases to confirm the presence of corresponding domains. the analysis revealed some members with incomplete domain structures, which have been confirmed by both domain searches and manual check. these members contain no typical domain structure and have no expression evidence with the characters of pseudogenes. due to the low feasibility of phylogenetic analyses by integrating these partial fragments, we removed these members from our analyses although we may under-estimate the rate of gene duplication. thus, our analyses reveal that soybean, rice and arabidopsis genomes encode total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> members of lectin superfamilies . their locus name, physical position and annotated protein sequences were deposited in the additional file  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> .

a new classification system of the lectin superfamily in higher plants
to classify these members, domain sequences from all members in each genome were aligned together and were then submitted to phylogenetic tree construction . the analyses show that all  <dig> organisms have  <dig> families of lectins . they are named according to their domain description in the pfam database, i.e., the b_lectin, lectin_legb, jacalin, phloem, lectin_c, chitin_bind_ <dig>  ricin_b_lectin, gal_lectin, gal_binding_lectin, calreticulin, eea and lysm families. in most cases, each family has a pfam domain id as shown in figure 1a. however, no domain id has been detected for the phloem and eea families. the phloem domain was first structurally identified by dinant et al.   <cit>  with  <dig> conserved motifis and is characterized by a high frequency of charged residues and seven conserved trp residues although phloem lectins were described in the seventies. similarly, the eul  domain in the eea family was recently identified  <cit>  although the family members were described more than  <dig> years ago  <cit> . among the total  <dig> identified families, both b_lectin and lectin_legb are the largest families for soybean and rice. however, in arabidopsis, the largest one is the jacalin family followed by lectin_legb, b_lectin and phloem families . the smallest families contain only one or two members including lectin_c, ricin_b_lectin and eea families .

based on the phylogenetic analyses of all genome-widely identified lectin genes in three organisms, we have proposed a new classification system. in this new system, each family contains members from a single carbohydrate binding-related domain. compared with the classification system  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> families, including b-lectin, lectin_legb, jacalin, chitin_bind_ <dig>  ricin_b_lectin, eea, lysm and phloem, have been found to match their corresponding families each other. their coordinates are gna, legume lectin, jacalins, hevein, ricin_b, eea, lysm and nitaba lectin families, respectively . no lectin member was identified in both rice and arabidopsis genomes that was classified into the remaining  <dig> families including cyanovirin, aba, amaranthin and cra, which were reported by van damme et al   <cit> . the result was confirmed by our searches and the soybean genome may also lack lectins from these families . thus, these families may be species-specific.

on the other hand, we also compared our new system with the classification system  <dig> as described in the website http://www.cermav.cnrs.fr/lectines/. among the  <dig> classes of lectins in this system,  <dig> of them including α-d-mannose-specific plant lectin, legume lectin, β-prism plant lectin, agglutinin with hevein domain and β-trefoil lectin have been detected to match their corresponding families including b-lectin, lectin_legb, jacalin, chitin_bind_ <dig> and ricin_b_lectin classes in our new system . similarly, the class "cyanovirin-n homolog" members have not been detected in our new system since they are mainly from fungi and bacteria. furthermore, based on our taxonomic coverage analyses by the interpro database  <cit> , these  <dig> families are ubiquitous in higher plants while only limited species could be detected with the four families identified by the system  <dig> including cyanovirin, aba, amaranthin and cra. thus, our new system can be used for the general lectin classification in higher plants and can not be used for species-specific lectins.

genome-wide identification reveals new classes of lectin families in soybean, rice and arabidopsis
interestingly, we have detected four more families including calreticulin, gal_binding_lectin, gal_lectin and lectin_c, which are not detected in the two classification systems . they were usually detected in animals. however, the calreticulin, gal_binding_lectin and gal_lectin families were also previously identified as putative plant lectins  <cit> . to our knowledge, no experimental data has been reported to confirm these members as plant lectins. for the calreticulin family, many members have been identified in plants  <cit> . however, no evidence shows their lectin activities although the family has been regarded as one of animal lectin groups  <cit> . the lectin_c family is known as s-type lectins in animals and fungi. we have detected  <dig> members of the lectin_c family lectins in soybean and one member in both rice and arabidopsis . expression evidence is from est for  <dig> soybean members and from full-length cdnas for rice and arabidopsis members, suggesting their presence in plants. moreover, domain amino acid sequence alignments showed that these  <dig> lectin_c domains from plants have at least 30% sequence identities when compared with the most closely related domains from animals, demonstrating their possible function as c-type lectins.

both the gal_binding_lectin and gal_lectin families are known as s-type lectins. for these two families, expression evidence was from est for most of soybean members and from full-length cdnas for both rice and arabidopsis. the fact demonstrates the presence of these two domains in plants. however, their domain amino acid sequences share low identities  when compared with the most closely related domains from animals. thus, their functions as lectins should be demonstrated by testing their activities. we have randomly selected one of these newly identified lectin members for further analyses. this gene was named as loc_os03g <dig> and contains two domains including both glyco_hydro_ <dig> and gal_lectin . the cdna sequences from different domain regions were cloned into the expression vector pgex-6p. the gst fusion proteins were expressed in the escherichia coli bl <dig> . the recombinant protein extracts were used for detecting lectin activities by hemagglutination testing . this method has been widely used for testing the lectin activity  <cit> . our data show that the gal_lectin domain indeed exhibits the agglutination activity whereas the glyco_hydro_ <dig> domain has no this function. the data suggest that this should be a new lectin identified in plants although its carbohydrate-binding specificity is not yet determined.

on the other hand, some of these four families of newly identified lectins contain other domains. thus, many of them may be annotated as other proteins. for example, most of gal_lectin or gal-binding lectin family members have been annotated as β-galactosidase or galactosyltransferase since these members contain glyco_hydro_ <dig> or galactosyl_t domain, respectively. these domain combinations are also observed in bacteria, nematodes and higher animals. therefore, they can be regarded as chimerolectins if their sugar binding properties can be experimentally validated.

different families show difference in their expansion and large-scale expansions occurred after the divergence from their ancestors
different lectin families exhibited differential expansions and as a result, plants have evolved into different sizes of lectin families. to infer the patterns of gene family expansions, we aligned the domain sequences of all members of each family from three organisms. the alignments were used to generate the phylogenetic trees and one of them is shown in figure 4a, which was constructed with b-lectin domain sequences. the phylogenetic tree was then broken down into ancestral units, which were clades that were present before the divergence of these organisms according to the method described by shiu et al   <cit> . the nodes of the most recent common ancestor  were labeled with solid red circles between soybean and arabidopsis and with black circles among  <dig> analyzed organisms . we found that there were  <dig> ancestral units among  <dig> soybean and  <dig> arabidopsis b-lectin members; however, only  <dig> mrcas have been detected among total of  <dig> b-lectin family members from these three organisms . the result indicated that the ancestral organism contained small family of b-lectin members and suggested that the large scale of expansions occurred after the divergence from their ancestors. a similar method was used for searching the lectin members of the ancestral organism for the remaining  <dig> families of lectins. the analysis showed that the ancestral organism between two dicot plants or among these three organisms also contained small numbers of lectin families . furthermore, we have also found several species-specific sub-family members for all three organisms . all these results confirmed that the large scale of expansions occurred after the divergence from their common ancestors.

tandem and segmental duplications represent the major mechanism of lectin family expansion
based on the genome-scale duplication data in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> , one ancestral gene in the mrca of arabidopsis and rice may give birth to four and two novel genes in arabidopsis and rice, respectively  <cit> . thus, maximal  <dig> arabidopsis and  <dig> rice b-lectin genes could be born on the basis of  <dig> members in the mrca between these two species. however, they have much more numbers of lectin genes, suggesting that other mechanisms, such as tandem, segmental duplication and/or retroposition must have also contributed to the expansion of the lectin gene super family.

to investigate the contribution of tandem duplication to the expansion of lectin genes, we examined the chromosomal distribution of members in each family of all three organisms. such analyses show that many genes are clustered together according to the criterion as described in methods section, suggesting that they were the results of tandem duplication. totally, we have detected  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  lectin genes being involving in tandemly duplicated events in soybean, rice and arabidopsis, respectively . on the other hand, we also genome-widely identified segmental duplications in soybean, rice and arabidopsis genomes and then searched the duplication blocks that contain lectin genes. in this case, tandemly arrayed genes were treated as a single gene copy. we have detected total of  <dig> segmental blocks and their duplicated blocks with the same family of lectin genes in soybean . these genes were from total of  <dig> different families. one of the families is the lectin_c and only one member was detected in both rice and arabidopsis. however, two members were detected in soybean, which was due to the segmental duplication as shown in the additional file 4_sheet <dig>  similarly, we have  <dig> and  <dig> segmental and their duplicated blocks with lectin genes in rice and arabidopsis, respectively . in summary, we have detected total of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  lectin genes being involving in segmentally duplicated events in soybean, rice and arabidopsis, respectively . these data suggested that both tandem and segmental duplications play a major role in lectin gene expansions. further investigation showed that some tandemly duplicated genes were also within segmentally duplicated regions with overlaps between these two duplications. figure  <dig> summarizes the contributions of tandem and segmental duplications to the expansions of various lectin gene families in three different organisms. generally, the highest contribution rate was observed in soybean with up to 84% of lectin genes were involved in tandem and/or segmental duplications and the remaining 16% of lectin genes were from other mechanisms. in both rice and arabidopsis, similar results were observed with around 28% and 34% of lectin genes were from other mechanisms in general . however, the contributions of tandem and segmental duplications to lectin expansions differ among different lectin families. for example, only 12-24% of b-lectin family members were from the other expansion mechanisms while the corresponding percentage has been up to 25-37% for lectin_legb family . furthermore, a same family also exhibits differences in their expansions among three organisms. for example,  <dig> of  <dig> gal_bind_ <dig> family members were within segmentally duplicated regions in soybean whereas only  <dig> of  <dig> rice members have been involved in such events and no member in arabidopsis has been born by tandem/segmental duplications . these facts may be regarded as one of reasons contributing to differential expansions of lectin members in different families of a same genome or in different genomes in a same family.

besides the lectin superfamily, many other gene families also expanded themselves by tandem and/or segmental duplications in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . since the soybean  genome sequencing data were released recently, limited data is available on the genome-wide identification of a gene family and its expansion history. we have genome-widely analyzed segmentally duplicated chromosome blocks in soybean. we found that many gene families in soybean also expanded themselves by segmental duplication such as ap <dig> domain encoding genes , wrky transcription factors  and heavy-metal-associated domain encoding genes  and so on. for example, we have detected  <dig> out of  <dig>  heavy-metal-associated domain encoding genes being involved in segmental duplication.

species-specific expansion and rapid birth-and-death evolution of some lectin families
we have observed that a same lectin family shows difference in their expansion among three species, exhibiting species-specific expansion. for example, the soybean genome encodes  <dig> b-lectin genes whereas only  <dig> members were detected in arabidopsis . to survey the possible mechanisms leading to species-specific expansion, we examined the contribution of tandem and/or segmental duplications to their expansion of these with at least two-fold difference in family members among  <dig> species including the b-lectin, jacalin, gal_lectin and gal-binding_lectin families. the investigation revealed multiple possible reasons responsible for the species-specific expansion. for example, deep expansion in the soybean b-lectin family is mainly due to the over expansion of tandem genes located on non-segmentally duplicated region . the arabidopsis jacalin family over-expanded themselves mainly by tandem and segmental mutual duplications . however, the major contribution of the species-specific expansion of the gal_lectin and gal_binding_ <dig> lectin families is mainly due to the segmental duplication .

the evidence showed that monocot branched off from dicot plants 140- <dig> million years ago   <cit> . based on the divergence era and the estimation of the mrca among soybean, rice and arabidopsis as shown in figure  <dig>  the birth rate of b-lectin genes  is at least  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes per  <dig> million years  per ancestral gene in lineages leading to soybean, rice and arabidopsis, respectively. the average rate of gene duplication is around  <dig> gene per  <dig> my per ancestral gene in eukaryotes such as homo sapiens, mus musculus, drosophila melanogaster, caenorhabditis elegans, saccharomyces cerevisiae and arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . thus, these rates are significantly higher than the average one. similarly, we have estimated the birth rates in other expanded families . the analyses show that different families exhibit difference in their gene duplication rates. the highest rate was observed in the jacalin family, where  <dig> genes per  <dig> million years in the lineage leading to arabidopsis. the lowest rate was  <dig> , significantly lower than the average rate, and occurred in the arabidopsis gal-bind_lectin and calreticulin families. on the contrary, by comparing the expansion mechanisms  and gene birth rates , we found that high gene birth rates are mainly due to tandem and/or segmental duplications. for these families, whose members being involving in both tandem and segmental duplications account for more than 50% of total identified lectins in all families and species, their gene birth rates were estimated at least  <dig> genes per  <dig> my per ancestral gene. in addition, the rates of gene birth in multiple lectin gene families may be under-estimated. the actual numbers of duplicate genes that once existed in three species could be more than that we have detected as some duplicate copies might have already been deleted from the genome or been evolved into pseudogenes that are not included in this study. we have detected  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> members from total of  <dig> families with partial domain sequences in soybean, rice and arabidopsis, respectively. these partial sequences usually lack regions corresponding to sugar binding properties. thus, they may be nonfunctional and could be regarded as pseudogenes. there seems to be a correlation between tandem duplication and pseudogenization since most of these members were from tandem duplication related expansion. on the other hand, some duplicated copies might be too divergent to be recognized now, which may also contribute to the under-estimation. thus, higher rates of gene duplication should have occurred for some lectin families in these three species.

differential expansion patterns of tandem and segmental dual duplications among three organisms
since the tandem duplication has been observed to largely contribute to the birth of new lectin genes, we further analyzed their expansion patterns. domain amino acid sequences from the same tandem cluster were aligned first and were then used for the construction of their phylogentic tree, which were employed to analyze their expansion history. based on such analyses, we found that parental genes were not always physically linked to their descendant genes and different expansion rates were observed for tandem genes in a same array. one of such examples was shown in figure  <dig>  in this example, we analyzed the patterns of tandem duplication in one of the largest tandem clusters in the soybean b-lectin family. we first investigated their expansion history by phylogenetic analyses . the  <dig> tandem genes are in three clades, suggesting that this cluster was the results of three ancestral units, which may be evolved from ancient tandem duplication events. one of them contains only one gene, i.e. glyma06g <dig>  no expansion was detected for this gene or its expanded genes have been lost during long evolutionary history. the second clade has  <dig> members whereas the third clade contains  <dig> members. on the basis of the phylogenetic tree, we deduced the hypothetical origins of  <dig> genes by tandem duplication . the analyses showed that these genes were generated by at least  <dig> rounds of tandem duplication. after expansion, these genes were then not always inserted into the loci according to their physical orders. for example, the putative tandem pair of the glyma06g <dig> gene is glyma06g <dig> but not its physical neighbor glyma06g <dig>  on the other hand, we found that most of tandem duplication occurred by a one-gene mode, i.e. only one gene was duplicated in a one tandem duplication event as shown in figure  <dig>  however, these cases were also observed that two or more genes in a cluster were duplicated through a single tandem duplication event .

based on our analyses on the expansion of the lectin superfamily by tandem and segmental duplications in three organisms , the evolution of considerable genes are related to both tandem and segmental duplications. to further investigate their contribution and patterns to the expansion of lectin members, segmental block pairs with at least  <dig> detectable tandemly arrayed genes were selected for more detail analyses. totally,  <dig> pairs of segmental blocks with such criteria were detected. three of them were from soybean including  <dig> b-lectin and  <dig> lectin_legb pairs. two of them were from arabidopsis b-lectin and jacalin families, respectively. the remaining one pair was from rice b-lectin family. total of  <dig> phylogenetic trees were constructed for  <dig> pairs of segmentally and tandemly duplicated members. in most cases , a part of genes from the first tandem array are clustered together with another part of genes from the secondary tandem array. they exhibit tandem-segment mixed duplication model. these cases were observed in both dicot plants soybean and arabidopsis as shown in figure 7a and 7b. such model of duplication may occur in two ways. one of them is tandem-segment-tandem duplication. in this case, the expansion was by tandemly duplication first and was then by segmental duplication followed by tandem duplication. the second way is segment-tandem-segment duplication. however, in the monocot rice genome, lectin expansion was through another model as shown in figure 7c. in this model, genes from a tandem array were clustered together and no clade was detected with members from both tandem arrays, exhibiting a tandem-segment separated duplication model. based on the phylogenetic relationship of these tandemly and segmentally duplicated members, one reasonable explain is that they underwent segmental duplication first followed by tandem duplication.

limited but significant contribution of retrogenes to the birth of new lectin genes in both soybean and rice
since tandem and segmental duplications can not explain all the duplication events, we expect some of other mechanisms may also contribute to the expansion of the lectin superfamily. these include both retrotransposon and transposon mediated gene expansion, which has been reported in multiple species including rice and arabidopsis  <cit> . by retrotransposition, a reverse-transcribed mrna was inserted into a new genomic position to form a retrogene. such a retrogene is usually devoid of introns and with the presence of target site duplications and/or a poly  tract  <cit> . to survey the contribution of retrogenes to the expansion of the lectin superfamily, one-exon-containing lectin genes were used as query protein sequences for blastp searches against all two or more exon-containing lectins . the searches produced many candidate retrogenes in soybean and rice. we then manually identified these candidates by the presence of target site duplications  and/or a poly  tract. the analyses revealed  <dig> putative retrogenes in soybean and  <dig> in rice . some of them are still with  <dig> hallmarks of retrogenes. one example is the soybean retrogene glyma08g <dig> with both hallmarks including tsd and poly  tract; its parental gene glyma03g <dig> contains two exons . on the other hand, not all identified retrogenes possess all three features, especially the poly  tract and short direct repeats  <cit> . these two hallmarks may no longer be recognized since they can be easily masked by base substitutions, insertions and/or deletions during a long evolutionary history  <cit> . although very limited contribution has been detected by retrogenes , they may play significant roles in the expansion of lectin genes. after the birth of a retrogene, it may further be expanded by tandem duplication. for example, the putative retrogene glyma08g <dig> was detected with tandem duplication followed by the birth of three new lectin genes including glyma08g <dig>  glyma08g <dig> and glyma08g <dig> . moreover, no retrogene has been detected in the arabidopsis lectin superfamily.

on the other hand, to investigate the contribution of dna transposons to the expansion of lectin genes, a 100- <dig> kb region including  <dig> kb upstream and downstream sequences for each gene was achieved and was then used for the identification of major dna transposons. we have analyzed class i mobile elements including mutator-like transposable element , cacta and hat as well as class ii helitron elements presented in these regions . in arabidopsis, no above mentioned dna transposon was detected to cover the lectin gene regions. however, we have identified considerable numbers of transposons presented in the 100- <dig> kb regions in soybean. for example,  <dig> mule-like,  <dig> cacta and  <dig> helitron elements have been detected and no hat element has been identified in soybean. however, most of these elements are located outside the corresponding lectin genes. only  <dig> genes were identified within  <dig> helitron elements. these genes include glyma08g <dig> , glyma09g <dig> , glyma13g <dig>  and glyma20g <dig> . they are candidates to contribute to the expansion of lectin genes. thus, dna transposon elements have limited contribution to the expansion of the lectin superfamily in soybean. a similar situation was also observed in rice. in this organism, we have detected  <dig> mule-like elements and all of them are located within lectin genes. five of these elements are within introns of corresponding lectin genes including loc_os04g <dig> , loc_os04g <dig> , loc_os05g <dig> , loc_os11g <dig>  and loc_os12g <dig> . the remaining one contributes the insertion of  <dig> exons of the lectin gene loc_os10g <dig>  and this mule-like element was named ti <dig> as described by juretic et al   <cit> . in addition, the remaining elements including cacta, hat and helitron have not been detected to contribute to the expansion of the lectin superfamily in rice.

expression profiling of the lectin superfamily in soybean, rice and arabidopsis
to survey the expression of all identified lectin genes, expression evidence was obtained from various expression databases as described in the methods section. we identified a gene to be an expressed gene if a full-length cdna, est and/or microarry/rna_seq  <cit>  could be available. based on our investigation, more than 90% of lectin genes from all three organisms are regarded as expressed genes . for soybean, only  <dig> lectin genes were experimentally detected to contain full-length cdnas and most expression evidence was from ests. in contrast,  <dig> of  <dig>  lectin genes have full-length cdnas as expression evidence in rice and more than half of arabidopsis lectin genes  have their corresponding full-length cdnas.

to investigate the expression profiles under various biotic and abiotic stresses, microarray/mpss data were achieved from various databases and statistic analyses were carried out  to determine if the expression of a lectin gene is regulated by biotic/abiotic stresses. for soybean, only  <dig> lectin genes were probed in the affymetrix microarray chips based on the annotation http://soybase.org/affychip/index.php. these genes are from  <dig> of  <dig> lectin families including b_lectin, lectin_legb, jacalin, lectin_c, chitin_bind_ <dig>  gal_lectin, gal_binding_lectin, eea and lysm. to analyze the expression profiles of these probed genes, microarray data were downloaded from gene expression omnibus  datasets  <cit>  and arrayexpress database  <cit>  as described in the methods section. we have analyzed the effects of both phytophthora sojae and cyst nematode infections on the lectin gene expression. the analyses showed that  <dig> lectin genes exhibited up-regulation after the infection of the pathogen p. sojae . these lectin genes include glyma06g <dig> , glyma07g <dig> , glyma09g <dig>  and three chitin_bind_ <dig> family genes: glyma13g <dig>  glyma19g <dig> and glyma19g <dig>  on the other hand, we have detected  <dig> lectin genes with changed expression by cyst nematode including  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated genes . among them, three genes were co-regulated by both biotic stresses including glyma09g <dig>  glyma13g <dig> and glyma19g <dig> . thus, total of  <dig> out of  <dig> lectin genes  have been detected to be involved in biotic stress-related signaling pathways.

on the other hand, we are also very interested in the soybean lectin genes related to legume-rhizobium symbiosis. we have found numbers of soybean-specific lectin family members based on the phylogenetic analysis. we are wondering whether some families of lectins involved in legume-rhizobium symbiosis are unique to soybean or are absent/non-functional in rice and arabidopsis. a  <dig>   <dig> probe-containing microarray analysis showed that at least  <dig> lectin-related probes have been detected with bradyrhizobium japonicum-regulated expression patterns  <cit> . these probes were from both soybean-specific and non-specific lectin genes. no enough evidence shows that soybean has evolved into some soybean-specific lectins specially for the legume-rhizobium symbiosis. for example, the lectin_legb family member glyma02g <dig> was up-regulated by the rhizobium. however, it is not soybean-specific lectin gene. generally, our data have demonstrated that soybean lectin families have been involved in legume-rhizobium symbiosis.

in rice and arabidopsis, expression data of most lectin genes are available under various biotic and abiotic stresses. we have downloaded all expression data of rice lectin genes under biotic and abiotic stresses from rice mpss database . data analyses showed that total of  <dig> and  <dig> lectin genes were differentially expressed after infection by the fungus and bacterium pathogens megnaporthe grisea  and xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae , respectively, among which  <dig> genes were regulated by both pathogens . thus, the expression abundance of total of  <dig> genes  was regulated by biotic stresses . on the other hand, we have detected  <dig> genes  with differential expression under cold, drought and/or high salinity stresses, among which  <dig> genes were regulated by all of three abiotic stresses . totally, we have detected  <dig> of  <dig> rice lectin genes  with differential abundance under biotic and/or abiotic stresses as  <dig> genes were regulated by both biotic and abiotic stresses . the percentages of regulated genes in each family vary from 19% for the lysm to 65% for the phloem families .

in arabidopsis,  <dig> of  <dig> lectin genes exhibited difference in their transcript abundance after the infection by the fungus and bacterium pathogens botrytis cinerea  or erysiphe orontii , accounting for 32% of the lectin superfamily members . up to  <dig> genes  were regulated by cold, drought and/or high salinity stresses and this ratio is significantly higher than that in rice . thus, total of  <dig> genes  underwent biotic/abiotic-stress regulation in their expression and each family showed difference in its response to both stresses with the percentages ranging from 31% for the gal_lectin to 100% for the chitin_bind_ <dig>  eea and calreticulin families .

besides the expression analyses under various stresses, we have also investigated the transcript profiling among different tissues to examine if the lectin superfamily has been involved in tissue specificity and functionality. in rice, we have examined the expression abundance in  <dig> different tissues. our analysis showed that  <dig> out of  <dig> lectin families have been detected to contain genes with tissue-specific expression. the percentages of tissue-specific genes are  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the b-lectin, chitin_binding_ <dig>  eea, gal_lectin, jacalin, lectin_legb and phloem families, respectively . these lectin genes were preferentially expressed only in one or two tissues. in arabidopsis, the transcript abundance was investigated among six different tissues including callus, germinating seedlings, inflorescence , leaves , root , silique . based on our analysis, only  <dig> out  <dig> lectin families contain genes with tissue-specific expression, significantly less than rice. these genes were from the b-lectin, jacalin, lectin_legb and phloem families. the percentages of tissue-specific genes in these  <dig> families are  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . these data demonstrated that lectin genes not only play a role in specific stress conditions some lectin families but also have been involved in tissue specific biological functions.

expression divergence among tandemly and segmentally duplicated genes
our data show that both tandem and segmental duplications have significantly contributed to the expansion of the lectin superfamily and high percentage of lectin members exhibited differential expression patterns under various biotic and abiotic stresses. to explore the effect of both tandem and segmental duplication on the expression patterns, we have carried out a detail analyses on their expression divergence among tandemly or segmentally duplicated members.

in soybean, among analyzed  <dig> lectin genes, four members were from two tandem clusters. one of them exhibits expression divergence after infection by cyst nematode as shown in figure 10a. on the other hand, we have also detected  <dig> segmentally duplicated blocks among  <dig> probed lectin genes in affymetrix chips. three blocks  exhibits expression divergence after infection by p. sojae or cyst nematode. for example, the gene glyma12g <dig> exhibits no difference in its expression after infection by p. sojae whereas its segmentally duplicated coordinate glyma06g <dig> was regulated by the pathogen . similar case was observed in another segmentally duplicated coordinates glyma04g <dig> and glyma06g <dig> . however, for the third coordinates glyma13g <dig> and glyma15g <dig>  both of them were down-regulated by cyst nematode and they exhibited difference in response to the infection time .

in rice, we have analyzed the expression divergence of total of  <dig> tandem clusters and  <dig> segmental blocks. if the expression patterns of any members of a tandem cluster exhibit difference from any other members in the cluster under either any biotic or abiotic stresses, this cluster is regarded as a divergent cluster in their expression. a similar criterion has also been applied to the evaluation of expression divergence in segmental duplications. based on the evaluation, we have identified  <dig> tandem clusters and  <dig> segmental blocks with differential expression under various biotic and abiotic stresses, accounting for 69% of total clusters and 88% of total segmental blocks, respectively . further analyses show that different lectin families exhibit significant difference in their expression divergence after tandem duplication, ranging from 40% for the jacalin family to 100% for the chitin_bind_ <dig>  gal_binding and phloem families . on the other hand, for segmentally duplicated blocks, most of them show expression divergence for most of families . however, the percentage may be over-estimated since the expression divergence from tandem duplication were also included if a tandem duplication occurred after segmental duplication.

in arabidopsis, we have investigated total of  <dig> tandem clusters and  <dig> segmental blocks. around 78% of tandem clusters and 82% of segmental blocks have been observed with regulated expression patterns under either biotic or abiotic stresses . in summary, expression data from soybean, rice and arabidopsis demonstrate that tandem and segmental duplications significantly contribute to gene expression divergence under various biotic and abiotic stresses.

domain combinations, high percentages of expression divergence and biological functions of lectin genes
due to the presence of hololectins and chimerolectins, we have submitted all lectin protein sequences for other domain detection. the analyses revealed that many lectins also contained other domains besides the carbohydrate-binding domain. we have detected at least  <dig> other domains presented in at least 30% of corresponding family members. they are kinase domain for b-lectin, lectin_legb and lectin_c families, f-box domain for phloem family, glyco_hydro_ <dig> domain for chitin_bind_ <dig> family, glyco_hydro_ <dig> domain for gal_lectin family and galactosyl_t domain for gal-binding lectin family . among them, more detail analyses have been carried out for the f-box-containing phloem lectins and they may play a role in nucleocytoplasmic protein degradation  <cit> . the presence of other domain suggests the more complicated functions and evolutions of plant lectins.

a only domains presented in at least 30% of corresponding family members were listed

one may concern why the lectin families have evolved in these ways and how these duplicated genes are retained and whether there are any biological needs or advantages to drive their evolution. domain combinations are the processes that generate new genes and functional divergences  <cit> . in this study, we have detected  <dig> domains presented in  <dig> families . one of them is the kinase domain, which was presented in three families including b-lectin, lectin_legb and lectin_c. here we focus on the b-lectin and lectin_legb families since only one or two members were detected for the lectin_c family in plants. for these two families, the combination with kinase domain did not occur in animals, bacteria and fungi, suggesting that the domain composition was established during the course of plant evolution. phylogenetic analyses showed that most of these domains were from the receptor-like kinase /pelle family  <cit> . interestingly, this family also underwent a rapid birth-and-death evolution in plants  <cit> . thus, both lectin and kinase domains were maintained by according evolution.

we try to further elucidate the biological benefits to drive the expansion and retention of the lectin superfamily by surveying the effect of tandem and/or segmental duplications on the expression divergence under biotic and abiotic stresses. previous reports have showed that tandemly duplicated genes tend to be involved in biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . many of the rlk family members are b-lectin or lectin_legb domain-containing proteins in rice and arabidopsis  <cit> . interestingly, the expression data also support the importance of this family in stress response  <cit> . these results further confirmed the co-evolution of b-lectin/lectin_legb and kinase domains. our expression data suggest a link between biotic/abiotic stresses and tandem/segmental duplications in lectin families and also suggest that not only tandem but also segmental duplications of lectin genes may be regarded as drivers for plants to adapt various environmental stresses through duplication followed by expression divergence, thus, providing an explanation for why some of lectin families exhibit large expansion. highly divergent expression profiles also demonstrate that each member of this gene superfamily may play specialized roles in a specific stress condition and function as a regulator of various environmental factors such as cold drought and high salinity stresses as well as biotic stresses. the detection of tissue-specifically expressed genes further demonstrated the comprehensive biological functions of this superfamily.

CONCLUSIONS
our data show that higher plant genomes encode large numbers of lectin proteins. these proteins can be phylogenetically classified into  <dig> different families and four of them consist of recently identified plant lectin members. further analyses show that some of lectin families exhibit species-specific expansion and rapid birth-and-death evolution. tandem and segmental duplications have been regarded as the major mechanisms for lectin expansion. our analyses also shows that lectin genes have been involved in biotic/abiotic stress regulations and tandem/segmental duplications may be regarded as drivers for plants to adapt various environmental stresses through duplication followed by expression divergence. all in all, our studies provide a new outline of the plant lectin gene superfamily and advance the understanding of plant lectin genes in their evolution, expansion and biotic/abiotic stress-related biological functions.
