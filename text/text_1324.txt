BACKGROUND
metastasis initiates with the migration of individual cells, or cellular collectives, from the tumor into the surrounding stroma  <cit> . individually invading tumor cells use either a mesenchymal or amoeboid mode of 3-d migration. in this context, mesenchymal invasion requires low actomyosin contractility, greater cell-substrate attachment, and proteolytic digestion of the extracellular matrix. in contrast, amoeboid invasion requires high contractility, low adhesion and is protease-independent  <cit> . a specific cell-type utilizes a specific mode of invasion, however, cells will switch from mesenchymal to amoeboid migration when mesenchymal motility is inhibited  <cit> . in vivo, amoeboid invasion is very rapid and is used by breast cancer cells to invade the stroma  <cit> . in vitro, a variety of colorectal and melanoma cancer cell lines adopt this mode of migration  <cit> . both 2d and 3d cell motility is driven by the coordinated regulation of actin dynamics and is dependent upon a variety of actin remodeling proteins.

formin homology proteins are a highly conserved family of cytoskeletal remodeling proteins distinguished by the presence of two functional domains, formin homology  <dig>  and fh <dig>  fh <dig> is proline-rich and a ligand for the small actin-binding protein profilin  <cit> . fh <dig> directly nucleates actin polymerization, inducing the formation of long, unbranched actin filaments ; some fh <dig> domains also bind and bundle f-actin . fh <dig> is a dual purpose domain that is also able to regulate microtubule  stabilization .

given their dramatic effects on cytoskeletal dynamics, it is not surprising that a number of formins have been shown to play a role in metastasis and invasion  <cit> . in particular, the fmnl sub-group of diaphanous-related formins have each been shown to be required for migration and invasion by transformed cells. fmnl <dig> promotes proliferation and motility of leukemia cells . fmnl <dig> is required for invasion in pc <dig> prostate cancer cells and down-regulation of fmnl <dig> expression is associated with suppression of metastasis . increased fmnl <dig> expression correlates with increased invasiveness in crc cell-lines  and fmnl <dig> is consistently highly expressed across the nci <dig> panel of melanoma cell-lines  <cit> . in patient samples increased fmnl <dig> expression also correlates directly with increased crc metastasis  <cit> . fmnl <dig> is required in both mda-mb- <dig> for amoeboid cell invasion in vitro and b16-f <dig> melanoma cells where it cooperates with the arp2/ <dig> complex for lamellipodial extension  <cit> . more recently, fmnl <dig> has been shown to participate in the regulation of cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesions  <cit> .

the ability of fmnl <dig> to govern cytoskeletal dynamics is regulated by an autoinhibitory interaction between its c-terminal diaphanous autoregulatory domain  and n-terminal diaphanous inhibitory domain   <cit> . inhibition is relieved by binding of either active rhoc or cdc <dig> to the fmnl <dig> gtpase binding domain   <cit> . deletion of either did or dad is sufficient to render fmnl <dig> constitutively active  <cit> . as with other formins, constitutively active derivatives of fmnl <dig> are able to induce f-actin accumulation and mt acetylation in vivo  <cit>  as well as bind and bundle actin filaments and accelerate f-actin polymerization in vitro  <cit> . f-actin bundling by fmnl <dig> is dependent on fh <dig> and an actin-binding wh <dig> motif immediately c-terminal to the fh <dig> domain  <cit> . the fmnl <dig> protein is targeted to the plasma membrane by n-myristoylation at gly <dig>  <cit> , although there are conflicting reports as to whether or not this modification is required for fmnl2-dependent cell migration  <cit> .

many formin genes undergo alternative splicing of their mrna and the resulting isoforms have significant impact on the regulation, localization and function of the encoded proteins . similarly, up-regulation of a specific splice form of the cytoskeletal remodeling proteins mena and palladin potentiates the invasive phenotype of transformed cells . there are at least  <dig> predicted alternative splice forms of fmnl <dig> affecting regions that are likely to impact on the activity, regulation and subcellular localization of the encoded proteins. we show here that there are at least four of the predicted fmnl <dig> isoforms expressed in crc and melanoma cells and that a novel isoform is preferentially up-regulated in invasive cells. we also show that invasion by a <dig> and wm <dig>  melanoma cells is fmnl2-dependent suggesting that fmnl <dig> might be generally required for 3d invasion in this cell-type. all four fmnl <dig> isoforms are able to rescue invasion in fmnl2-depleted a <dig> cells, but the “invasive” isoform is significantly better than the other three.

methods
cell culture
u2os osteosarcoma human cells were a gift from dr. laura trinkle-mulcahy and were grown in dmem 10 % fbs at 37 °c, in 5 % co <dig>  all other cell-lines were obtained from the american type culture collection  and were maintained as recommended by the supplier.

plasmids
the fmnl <dig> isoforms described in this study correspond to the following accession numbers. itm: np_ <dig> . <dig>  yhy: q96py <dig>  pmr: xp_ <dig>  tqs: xp_ <dig> . full length  fmnl <dig> isoform cdna were assembled in a step-wise fashion into the pef-plink2-mcherry vector. briefly, the alternative 3′ ends of each fmnl <dig> isoform was amplified by polymerase chain reaction  from cdna generated from sw <dig> cell mrna. the conserved 5′ portion of the fmnl <dig> cdna was amplified from kiaa <dig> . fmnl <dig> fh1 + fh <dig> derivatives were subcloned into pef.nbrss from the full-length constructs. for rescue, fmnl <dig> full-length isoforms were cloned into plvx-ires-mcherry lentivirus vector. all pcr reactions were performed using standard techniques and the phusion high fidelity dna polymerase .

serum response factor  assay
srf reporter gene assays were performed as described previously . briefly, nih 3t <dig> fibroblasts were seeded on 6-well plates at  <dig>  <dig> cells/well  <dig> day prior to transfection. the cells were transfected using polyethylenimine transfection reagent  with the indicated expression plasmids  and the reporter constructs p3d.a.luc  and pmlvlacz . after 5 h, the cells were placed in low serum medium . cells were harvested the next day and lysed in 1x reporter lysis buffer; luciferase assays were performed according to the supplied protocol  and read in an lmaxii luminometer . the activation of luciferase was standardized to an srf-vp <dig> control. a β-galactosidase  assay is performed in parallel as a transfection efficiency control. the cell lysates are also subjected to a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel  and immunoblotted to detect fmnl <dig> expression levels.

rna extraction, rt-pcr, and qpcr
the indicated cell-lines were grown to 70–80 % confluence in 10 cm dishes. total rna was harvested using the rneasy mini kit . total rna concentration was determined by reading the od <dig>  rna quality was assessed on denaturing formaldehyde/agarose mops gel and visualization of distinct 18s and 28s ribosomal subunits. cdna were synthesized using mulv reverse transcriptase and the geneamp rna pcr kit . paw <dig> rna serves as a positive rt-pcr control and no rna  served as negative control. characterization of the fmnl <dig> isoforms in a <dig>  sw <dig> and sw <dig> cancer cell lines was accomplished by performing a pcr reaction . pcr products were separated on 1 % agarose gels. amplified bands were isolated with gen elute gel extraction kit  and directly sequenced. these sequences were used to design primers for qpcr.

real time pcr analysis was performed to determine absolute expression levels of fmnl <dig> isoforms using the following primers. itm forward 5′-gccattgaagatattatcacagatc-3′, rev 5′-aacttgcgttctgttaatggtg-3′, amplicon 117 bp; yhy 5′-ctgaagactgtgccctttactgct-3′, 5′-cctgttctcactgaggaataccattac-3′, amplicon 87 bp; pmr 5′-cattgaagatattatcacagcctta-3′, 5′-gaggatcttagaaaccaaccata-3′, amplicon 87 bp; tqs 5′-gatattatcacagccttaaagaagaat-3′, 5′-tggtggaggatacacagagct-3′, amplicon 106 bp; pan-fmnl <dig> 5′-gctcctcccttagcacct-3′, 5′-gccaatcaagacgaagttcaga-3′, amplicon 127 bp; β-actin 5′-gcaccacaccttctacaatgag-3′, 5′-gacccagatcatgtttgagacc-3′, amplicon 122 bp. standard curves were established using fmnl <dig> fh1 + fh2 + c templates corresponding to each isoform. a logarithmic series of template dilutions were generated . a standard curve for β-actin template was also generated as a control. the experimental design included standards, no template controls and unknowns. standards contained: 5 μl fmnl <dig> isoform template, 5 μl of specific fmnl <dig> isoform primer  and 10 μl of the sybr green pcr premix  used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. unknown reactions consisted of 5 μl cdna  , 5 μl primers and 10 μl sybr green qpcr premix. no template control reactions were 5 μl of primers, 10 μl of sybr green mix and 5 μl ddh2o. 5-carboxy-x-rhodamine  is also included in the sybr green qpcr premix and serves as a passive loading reference dye. the qpcr reactions were run on an mx 3005p qpcr instrument . standard curves for each isoform were used to determine the relationship between the fluorescent signal  and absolute copy number of each fmnl <dig> isoforms in each sample.

immunofluorescence
nih-3t <dig> fibroblast cells were seeded at a density of  <dig>  <dig> cells/well in 6-well plates containing acid-washed coverslips and 10 % dbs dmem medium. the cells were transfected using pei  as above. 24 h later, the cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde  in pbs for 15 min, washed three times with 1x pbs  and permeabilized for 30 min with  <dig>  % triton x- <dig>  10 % horse serum in 1xpbs. fixed cells were incubated at room temperature with primary antibodies in  <dig>  % triton x- <dig> plus 5 % horse serum 1x pbs for 1 h. cells were washed three times in 1x pbs and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody and fluorescein-phalloidin  in  <dig>  % triton x- <dig> plus 5 % horse serum 1x pbs at room temperature for 1 h. the cells were washed three times in 1x pbs and once in ddh2o and mounted on slides with vectashield mounting medium with dapi . images were captured on a zeiss axio imager z <dig> fluorescence microscope, using a 63x plan apochromat objective and an axiocam hrm camera. optical sections were obtained with the apotome <dig>  images were processed using axiovision software and figures assembled using adobe photoshop.

filopodia formation in transfected cells was assessed visually by immunofluorescence. transfected cells expressing myr-mcherryfp or fmnl2-mcherry were identified by virtue of the mcherryfp tag and f-actin visualized by fluorescein-phalloidin as above. cells with an obvious over-proliferation of filopodia  compared to either non-transfected neighbours or myr-mcherryfp expressing control cells were counted and the result expressed as a percent of transfected cells.

western blotting
cells were grown to 70–80 % confluence in 10 cm dishes, washed with 1xpbs and harvested in 1xsds buffer. lysates were subjected to sds-page and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. chemiluminescence was used for detection using the western hrp substrate reagent  and visualized on a ge image quant las <dig> imaging system. blots were stripped in  <dig>  m glycine,  <dig>  % sds  for 1 h. blots were re-blocked and probed with mouse-anti-α-tubulin  to assess loading. chemiluminescence and visualization is performed as described previously. pan-fmnl <dig> antiserum was raised in chicken  using the isolated fmnl2-fh <dig> protein  expressed in e.coli and purified as previously described  <cit> . all fmnl <dig> antisera were affinity purified using standard protocols  <cit> . affinity purified anti-fmnl <dig> antibody was described previously  <cit> .

fmnl <dig> sirna
a <dig> or wm <dig>  melanoma cells were seeded in six well plates or  <dig>  cm dishes  at a density of  <dig>  <dig> cells/well. the following day, cells were transfected  with control or fmnl <dig> sirna duplexes  as directed by the manufacturer. the sirna duplex targeted the 3′utr of fmnl <dig> . a non-specific universal negative control duplex  was used for all sirna knockdown experiments. this control duplex does not recognize any sequences in human, mouse or rat transcriptomes . following transfection, cells were incubated at 37 °c  for 48 h. a fluorescent tye  <dig> ds control was used to verify transfection efficiency. after 48 h, cells are harvested and the lysates subjected to immunoblotting to detect fmnl <dig> expression levels.

2-d migration assay
a <dig> melanoma cells were seeded in six well plates or  <dig>  cm petri dish  at a density of  <dig>  cells/well. the following day, the cells were transfected with sirna; after 48 h  <dig>  a <dig> cells were added to each chamber of an ibidi wound insert in a  <dig>  cm petri dish . the outside of the insert was filled with  <dig>  ml of dmem 10 % fbs. in parallel, cells were also seeded in duplicate to assess knockdown efficiency by immunobloting. the next day, the insert was removed to generate the wound and the plate was gently washed with 10 % fbs dmem to remove any floating cells. wound closure was monitored for 48 h by live imaging on a zeiss axiovert  <dig> microscope  in a controlled environment . the percent wound closure was calculated by measuring the distance of the gap at three points using northern eclipse software .

virus production and transduction
fmnl <dig> cdna were cloned into the lentiviral vector plvx-ires-mcherry for virus production. briefly,  <dig> plates  of 293 t cells at 70 % confluence were transfected with  <dig>  μg of the fmnl <dig> plvx-ires-mcherry construct,  <dig>  μg of the envelop plasmid ,  <dig>  μg of the packaging plasmid pspax <dig> using pei. virus was collected from the medium supernatant every day for the next 48 h. the virus was concentrated and titrated to determine the multiplicity of infection . for rescue experiments, a <dig> melanoma cells were seeded at a density of  <dig>  <dig> cells/well, in a six well plate or in a  <dig>  cm petri dish with a coverslip. the next day, the cells were transfected with sirnas and incubated for 24 h before infection with the fmnl <dig> expressing lentiviral vectors using a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig>  the cells were left for another 24 h before seeding for an invasion assay. efficiency of knockdown and re-expression of fmnl <dig> was assessed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence on parallel samples.

transwell invasion assay
 <dig>  mm/8 μm transwell inserts  were coated with 100 μl of 1: <dig> dmem:growth factor reduced matrigel  and allowed to polymerize for 1 h at 37 °c. the polymerized transwells were flipped upside down and the underside coated with 50 μl of a 1: <dig> matrigel: dmem solution to facilitate cell adhesion and placed back into the 37 °c incubator for 1 h.  <dig> a <dig> cells in 70 μl of dmem  were seeded on the underside of the inserts and allowed to adhere for 3 h at 37 °c. the inserts were then flipped into a  <dig> well plate containing 600 μl of dmem  on the bottom. 200 μl of 20 % fbs dmem was carefully added to the top of the insert. cells were left to invade through the matrigel at 37 °c  for 72 h. the cells were then fixed with csk buffer  for 30 min, washed with pbs and then permeabilized with  <dig>  % triton x- <dig> for another 30 min. the cells were stained with 50 μg/ml of propidium iodide overnight at 4 °c. the transwells were then gently washed in pbs, rinsed in ddh2o, and then placed onto a 35 mm mat-tek coverslip culture dish with 15 μl vectashield . cells were imaged on a zeiss lsm.pascal using a 40x na <dig>  oil objective.  <dig> optical sections were taken  with the z step set at nyquist sampling frequency  and total number of cells counted in each section to determine invasion frequency.

RESULTS
there are  <dig> human fmnl <dig> isoforms listed in the ncbi protein database at present. these isoforms are generated by alternative splicing of their mrna and the exons affected encode both functional and regulatory domains in the fmnl <dig> protein. therefore we wished to determine which fmnl <dig> isoforms are expressed in cell-types relevant to the study of the role of fmnl <dig> in invasion and metastasis. a series of overlapping primer pairs was designed to span the entire fmnl <dig> coding sequence with attention paid to regions bridging the predicted alternative splice sites. these primers were used to amplify individual sections of the entire fmnl <dig> coding sequence using cdna prepared from sw <dig> to sw <dig> colorectal cancer, and a <dig> melanoma, cell-lines. the resulting amplified fragments were gel-purified and sequenced directly. from this analysis only four fmnl <dig> alternatively spliced isoforms were detected and these varied only at the 3′ end of the coding sequence . based on sequence analysis, additional primer pairs were designed to confirm these results directly and to amplify these sequences specifically . the proteins encoded by the alternatively spliced mrna differ only in the region c-terminal to the autoregulatory dad domain and are designated itm, pmr, yhy, and tqs for the final three c-terminal amino acid residues of each protein . it should be noted that additional alternatively spliced versions of fmnl <dig> are listed in the ncbi database, however, all of these splicing events are predicted to affect other regions of the coding sequence, that is, there are no additional 3′ splice variants predicted that encode additional alternative c-terminal tails. no other splice variants were detected in our assays.fig.  <dig> a specific fmnl <dig> isoform is over-represented in invasive cells. a rt-pcr was performed on total rna harvested from sw <dig>  sw <dig> and a <dig> cells. specific primers were used to demonstrate the presence of four alternatively spliced fmnl <dig> isoforms identified in an initial rt-pcr analysis . b the four alternatively spliced mrna are predicted to encode proteins differing only at amino acid residues c-terminal to the dad domain. c qpcr was used to assess the levels of expression of each isoform in comparison to total fmnl <dig> in the indicated colorectal and melanoma cell-lines as well as in non-transformed primary endothelial cells and melanocytes. the tqs isoform was predominant in all the invasive cell-lines that were assessed. we were unable to obtain reliable qpcr data for the pmr isoform. d isoform specific antibodies were raised against peptides corresponding to the unique domain of each c-terminal tail. full-length derivatives of the indicated fmnl <dig> isoforms bearing n-terminal myc epitope tags were expressed in u2os cells by transient transfection and the resulting cell lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. total fmnl <dig> protein was detected using an antibody directed against fmnl <dig> codons 599– <dig>  equivalent samples were loaded on a separate gel and probed with α-myc antibodies. the α-fmnl <dig> blot was stripped and re-probed with α-tqs antibody; the α-myc blot was stripped and re-probed with α-pmr antibody. equivalent samples were loaded on separate gels to detect itm and yhy e immunoblot analysis using antibodies directed against the c-terminal tails of each of the predicted fmnl <dig> isoforms confirms the qpcr analysis. total fmnl <dig> protein was detected using pan fmnl <dig> antibody shown in 1d. isoform specific antibodies were raised against peptides corresponding to the unique domain of each c-terminal tail. equivalent samples were loaded on separate gels to eliminate concerns regarding incomplete stripping. the pan-fmnl <dig> blot was stripped and re-probed with anti α-tubulin for a loading control



in our initial rt-pcr analysis we noted apparent variations in the relative abundance of the different fmnl <dig> splice forms . therefore we wished to determine the expression levels of each isoform in a panel of relevant cell-lines chosen either for utilizing an amoeboid mode of migration, or for their tissue of origin . primary huvecs, primary melanocytes, a <dig> carcinoma and u2os osteosarcoma cells were also included for comparison. primers unique to each alternatively spliced isoform were designed for qpcr analysis and amplification efficiency was calibrated using the relevant cloned cdna. validated primer sets were obtained for the linear amplification of total fmnl <dig>  itm, yhy and tqs, however, we were unable to generate primers for the specific linear amplification of pmr. the cloned cdna were also used to generate standard curves that allowed the derivation of absolute copy number for each isoform in the various cell-lines. consistent with previous reports  <cit> , we confirmed that fmnl <dig> expression is elevated in the metastatic sw <dig> cell-line when compared to parental sw <dig> cells . we also detected similar elevated levels of expression in ls174t crc cells, as well as a <dig> and wm <dig>  melanoma cells . we were unable to detect fmnl <dig> mrna in u2os cells and only low levels of fmnl <dig> mrna in primary huvecs. surprisingly, the total level of fmnl <dig> expression in primary melanocytes was similar to that in the melanoma cell-lines. specific, individual measurement of the separate fmnl <dig> isoforms indicated that tqs was essentially the sole isoform expressed in a <dig>  wm <dig>  and sw <dig> cells and the major isoform in ls174t and a <dig> cells. in primary melanocytes, however, tqs accounts for less than 50 % of total fmnl <dig> mrna. we were unable to assess levels of pmr expression in this assay. nevertheless, a comparison of total fmnl <dig> with the sum of the individual isoforms suggests that, with the notable exception of primary melanocytes, pmr does not contribute significantly to total fmnl <dig> mrna levels.

we next wished to confirm the results of our qpcr assays at the protein level. total fmnl <dig> levels were assessed using a pan-fmnl <dig> antibody recognizing an invariant region in the n-terminus. we also generated polyclonal antibodies raised against peptides corresponding to the unique c-terminal tails of each of the four fmnl <dig> isoforms . these antibodies were affinity purified and used for immunoblot analysis of lysates from the panel of cell-lines used in fig. 1c. the pan-fmnl <dig> immunoblot  largely confirmed the qpcr results, with highest levels of fmnl <dig> expression in primary melanocytes and metastatic melanoma  and crc  cell-lines. fmnl <dig> protein was not detected in u2os cell lysates. the isoform specific immunoblots also showed that only primary melanocytes express a mix of the four fmnl <dig> isoforms; significant levels of yhy and pmr are not detected in the other cell-lines and only low levels of itm are detected across this panel. in contrast, the tqs specific immunoblot shows that it is the major isoform expressed in a <dig>  sw <dig> and wm <dig>  cell-lines.

amino acid residues c-terminal to the dad motif are predicted to modulate formin autoregulation  <cit>  and modify fh <dig> activity  <cit> . to compare activity of the fmnl <dig> isoforms, we generated full-length cdnas encoding each of the four splice variants. fmnl proteins are predicted to be n-myristoylated  <cit>  and this modification may play some role in targeting these proteins to the plasma membrane. to assess the effects of n-myristoylation we generated fmnl <dig> derivatives with either n-terminal myc epitope tags or c-terminal mcherryfp tags. these were expressed in nih 3t <dig> cells by transient transfection and their subcellular localization and effects on cell morphology and the actin cytoskeleton were assessed by immunofluorescence . the c-terminal tagged derivatives were recruited to the plasma membrane where they induced extensive filopodia formation . this was not the case with the n-terminal tagged proteins, which were distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm. expression of n-terminal tagged versions of itm, yhy or tqs did not induce filopodia formation above the background levels seen in control cells while expression of pmr was only sufficient to induce filopodia formation in a minority of cells . we also compared activity of n- and c-terminal tagged proteins using an srf reporter gene assay. this reporter gene is activated by the mrtf/srf transcription pathway in response to depletion of cellular pools of g-actin and is an indirect, sensitive and quantitative measure of changes in actin dynamics  <cit> . neither n- nor c-terminal tagged full-length derivatives of the fmnl <dig> isoforms induced robust activation of the srf reporter in this assay suggesting that, as expected, the full-length derivatives of each isoform are not constitutively active. some differences, however, were apparent between the four isoforms, both in terms of basal activity and the effects of the position of the tag. pmr showed the most activity, inducing activation of the srf reporter gene to similar levels above background for both n-and c-terminal tagged derivatives . in contrast, the c-terminally tagged full-length derivatives of itm, yhy and tqs were largely inactive, while the n-terminal tag on itm had a modest effect on its autoinhibition as well.fig.  <dig> fmnl <dig> expression induces filopodia formation. a c-terminally tagged full-length derivatives of each fmnl <dig> isoform were expressed in nih 3t <dig> fibroblasts by transient transfection. f-actin  was detected with phalloidin and fmnl <dig> expression  was detected by virtue of the c-terminal mcherry tag. nuclei were detected with dapi  in merged image. fmnl <dig> expression induced extensive filopodia formation in comparison to untransfected cells or cells expressing mcherryfp with an n-terminal myristoylation motif . b n-terminally tagged full-length derivatives of each of the fmnl <dig> isoforms were expressed in nih 3t <dig> cells by transient transfection. f-actin  was detected with phalloidin and fmnl <dig> expression  was detected by virtue of the n-terminal myc tag. expression of n-terminally tagged fmnl <dig> isoforms does not induce filopodia formation. mcherryfp was included as a control  c quantification of data shown in . “c” indicates c-terminal mcherry tag, “n” indicates n-terminal myc tag. n =  <dig>  > <dig> cells counted per sample, error bars = sem. d nih 3t <dig> fibroblasts were transiently transfected with an srf luciferase reporter gene and the indicated full-length fmnl <dig> derivative. “c” indicates c-terminal mcherry tag, “n” indicates n-terminal myc tag. reporter activation is expressed relative to an srf-vp <dig> control fusion protein. n =  <dig>  error bars = sem. e equivalent samples of transfected cell lysates were subjected to sds-page and immunoblotted. expression of the indicated fmnl <dig> isoforms was detected with either anti-mcherry or anti-myc antibody



the results of the srf reporter gene assays suggest that the full-length fmnl <dig> isoforms are largely autoinhibited and that fmnl2-induced filopodia are likely a product of basal levels of fmnl2-induced f-actin formation on top of remodeling of pre-existing actin filaments. we therefore also wanted to compare the activity of constitutively active derivatives of the four isoforms. deletion derivatives consisting of fh <dig>  fh <dig> and the c-terminal tail  of each isoform were expressed in nih 3t <dig> cells by transient transfection and the effects on cell morphology and actin polymerization were assessed by immunofluorescence . all four isoforms behaved similarly in this assay and induced a typical “formin” phenotype with extensive formation of thin stress fibers running from one end of the cell to the other. no obvious differences were apparent in the subcellular localization of each of these derivatives either. the srf reporter gene assay was also used to compare the effects of each isoform on actin dynamics. expression of the fh1fh2 + c derivative of each isoform was sufficient to induce robust srf reporter gene activation consistent with previous results for itm  <cit> . as with the formation of stress fibers, there was no obvious difference in the level of activation of the srf reporter induced by expression of each isoform.fig.  <dig> constitutively active derivatives of fmnl <dig> induce stress fiber formation. a schematic of fh1-fh2 + c containing derivatives of each fmnl <dig> isoform. b fh1-fh2 + c containing derivatives of fmnl <dig> were expressed in nih 3t <dig> cells by transient transfection. expression of each of the fmnl <dig> isoforms  was sufficient to induce stress fiber formation . nuclei were detected with dapi in the merged image. c nih 3t <dig> fibroblasts were transiently transfected with an srf luciferase reporter gene and the indicated fmnl <dig> derivative. reporter activation is expressed relative to an srf-vp <dig> control fusion protein. n =  <dig>  error bars = sem. equivalent samples of transfected cell lysates were subjected to sds-page and immunoblotted using an anti-myc antibody 



our preliminary analysis of the full-length fmnl <dig> isoforms suggested that there are some functional differences between them . we wished to determine if this extends to their effects on cell behavior. previous work has suggested that fmnl <dig> is required for both 2d and 3d cell motility in specific cell-types  <cit> . therefore we wanted to determine if fmnl <dig> is required for motility in a <dig> cells which express the tqs isoform almost exclusively. we used sirna duplexes targeted against fmnl <dig> to knockdown its expression in a <dig> cells and the level of depletion was assessed by immunoblotting with an anti-fmnl <dig> antibody ; cells transfected with non-specific duplex were used as a control. fmnl <dig> expression was knocked down very efficiently and the effects of fmnl <dig> depletion on cell motility were assessed using a variation on the scratch wound assay. in this assay, cells were seeded in a culture insert composed of two chambers separated by a divider and allowed to grow to confluence. removal of the insert creates a standard “wound” and migration into the wound is followed by live-cell imaging. control cells extensively infiltrated the wound by 20 h and filled the wound by 40 h . in contrast, fmnl2-depleted cells made little progress into the wound even after 40 h . this suggests that fmnl <dig> plays a role in 2d migration in a <dig> cells and encouraged us to investigate if the same holds true for 3d invasion.fig.  <dig> fmnl <dig> is required for 2-d migration in a <dig> melanoma cells. a a <dig> cells were transfected with either control sirna duplex or duplexes targeting all fmnl <dig> isoforms. the transfected cells were grown to confluence in scratch wound assay chambers . wound closure was followed at the indicated times by phase contrast live-cell microscopy. b equivalent samples of cell lysates from  were subjected to sds-page and immunoblotted to detect fmnl <dig> expression with anti-fmnl <dig> antibody. the pan-fmnl <dig> blot was stripped and re-probed with anti α-tubulin as a loading control. c quantification of the data shown in . the gap in the cellular monolayer is represented as % wound closure. n =  <dig>  error bars = sem. ** indicates p <  <dig>  and *** indicates p <  <dig> 



a <dig> and wm <dig>  melanoma cells both invade using an amoeboid mode of 3d migration  <cit> . to determine if fmnl <dig> is required for 3d migration in these cells, we used a modified boyden chamber assay to measure invasion  <cit> . in this assay cells are seeded on the underside of a transwell insert and their ability to invade upward into a matrigel matrix is assessed by confocal microscopy. sirna duplexes were used to knockdown fmnl <dig> expression in both a <dig> and wm <dig>  cells and fmnl <dig> was efficiently depleted in both cell-types as measured by immunoblotting . fmnl <dig> depletion did not affect expression levels of the related protein fmnl <dig> in a <dig> cells  and expression of fmnl <dig> was not detected . the effect of fmnl <dig> depletion on the ability of a <dig> and wm <dig>  cells to invade was compared to control cells transfected with non-specific sirna duplexes. for both cell-types we found that fmnl <dig> depletion was sufficient to significantly inhibit invasion in the transwell assay .fig.  <dig> fmnl <dig> is required for invasion in a <dig> and wm <dig>  melanoma cells. a a <dig> and wm <dig>  melanoma cells were transfected with control or fmnl2-specific sirna duplexes. control and knockdown cells were then assayed for their ability to invade in vitro in an inverted boyden chamber assay . fmnl <dig> knockdown inhibited invasion in both a <dig> and wm <dig>  cells. b equivalent samples of a <dig> cell lysates from  were subjected to sds-page and immunoblotted to detect fmnl <dig> and fmnl <dig>  the pan-fmnl <dig> blot was stripped and re-probed with anti α-tubulin as a loading control. c equivalent samples of wm <dig>  cell lysates from  were subjected to sds-page and immunoblotted to detect fmnl <dig>  the pan-fmnl <dig> blot was stripped and re-probed with anti α-tubulin as a loading control. d a <dig> cells were transfected with control and fmnl2-targeted sirna duplexes and then infected with control lentiviral vector or lentiviral vectors expressing the indicated untagged full-length fmnl <dig> isoforms. the cells were then assayed for their ability to invade as in . images show a representative z-stack projection from the invasion assays. e equivalent samples of cell lysates from  were subjected to sds-page and immunoblotted to detect fmnl <dig>  α-tubulin was used as a loading control. f quantification of data shown in . n =  <dig>  error bars = sem. *indicates p <  <dig>  where noted. there was no significant difference between tqs and itm or tqs and yhy



having shown that fmnl <dig> is required for invasion in these cells, we wanted to compare the relative ability of each of the four fmnl <dig> isoforms to rescue invasion in knockdown cells. a <dig> cells were selected for this experiment as they were more invasive in our assay, fmnl <dig> was efficiently knocked down, and the effect of fmnl <dig> knockdown on invasion was more striking with these cells than with wm <dig>  . lentiviral rescue vectors were generated for itm, yhy, pmr and tqs. this vector does not encode an epitope tag on the protein of interest, but does express mcherryfp as a separate protein via an ires within the same mrna. empty vector expressing mcherry alone was used as a control. using these vectors we were able to achieve nearly 100 % transduction efficiency in a <dig> cells. as before, transfection of control sirna duplex had no effect on invasion while knockdown of fmnl <dig> strongly inhibits it. efficiency of knockdown, and inhibition of invasion, is not affected by infection with the control lentiviral vector in fmnl2-depleted cells . in contrast, expression of each of the individual fmnl <dig> isoforms was sufficient to rescue invasion. it should be noted, however, that each isoform did not rescue to the same extent. pmr was the least efficient, tqs was the most efficient, while yhy and itm fell in between. indeed, the enhanced invasion observed with tqs was significantly greater than both the parental cell-line and pmr-rescued cells . this suggests that there are unique functional differences between fmnl <dig> isoforms when it comes to driving invasive cell migration.

discussion
we provide here the initial description of two previously uncharacterized isoforms of fmnl <dig>  and show that at least four alternatively spliced fmnl <dig> isoforms are expressed in primary melanocytes. in contrast, the tqs isoform predominates in invasive melanoma and crc cell-lines and we find that knockdown of fmnl <dig> expression in a <dig> and wm <dig>  melanoma cells is sufficient to inhibit invasion in an in vitro assay. taken with previous reports that fmnl <dig> is required for migration in mouse b <dig> melanoma cells and for invasion in mda-mb- <dig>  <cit> , our results suggest that fmnl <dig> is likely to be generally required for invasion in melanoma cells. like mda-mb- <dig> cells, both a <dig> and wm  <dig>  cells use an amoeboid mode of migration for 3d invasion and these results suggest that this mode of invasion might also generally require fmnl <dig> or related activity  <cit> .

at least four fmnl <dig> isoforms  are expressed in the assessed cell-types at both the transcript and protein level. although we cannot discount that additional isoforms may be expressed in other cell-types, we did not find any evidence for additional isoforms in our assays. in addition, the four unique c-terminal tails we describe are the only c-termini predicted for all fmnl <dig> isoforms currently listed in the ncbi database. thus, the antiserum directed against each unique fmnl <dig> c-terminal peptide should account for all predicted isoforms of fmnl <dig>  in primary melanocytes all four splice forms were readily detected at the protein level, however, in wmm <dig> , a <dig> and sw <dig> cells tqs is by far the predominant isoform. this raises the intriguing possibility that tqs represents an “invasive isoform” of fmnl <dig> similar to previous descriptions of invasive isoforms of mena  <cit>  and palladin  <cit> . in support of this hypothesis we find that in fmnl2-depleted a <dig> cells, tqs is able to rescue invasion significantly better than pmr and to a significantly higher level than control cells. it should be noted that under the conditions of the rescue experiment, the levels of exogenous fmnl <dig> expression were considerably higher than the endogenous protein and it is likely that the system is saturated for fmnl <dig> activity. if that is the case, it would suggest that the observed effects represent the maximal potentiation of invasion by each isoform in these cells.

increased fmnl <dig> expression is reported to directly correlate with increased invasiveness in colorectal cancer cell-lines  <cit> . our results confirm this observation and show that fmnl <dig> expression is up-regulated at both the mrna and protein level in sw <dig> crc cells when compared to their poorly invasive sw <dig> progenitor cell-line. indeed, the level of total fmnl <dig> expression in sw <dig> cells is similar to that observed in the melanoma cell-lines. surprisingly, fmnl <dig> is expressed to comparable levels in non-transformed primary melanocytes. as part of their normal physiological role melanocytes themselves are somewhat “invasive” and deliver melanosomes via widespread formation of filopodia . given the ability of fmnl <dig> to support invasion and induce filopodia formation, it might therefore be expected that elevated levels of fmnl <dig> expression would also be required in these cells. a key difference between the primary melanocytes and melanoma cells, however, is the variety of fmnl <dig> isoforms expressed. as noted, the tqs isoform predominates in a <dig> and wm <dig>  cells while at least four fmnl <dig> isoforms are expressed in primary melanocytes. this suggests an intriguing model where it is not the total level of fmnl <dig> expression that determines invasiveness in melanoma, but the specific isoform that is expressed.

the itm, yhy, pmr and tqs isoforms of fmnl <dig> differ only at a relatively small region in their c-termini. nevertheless, the sequences affected are suggested to be critical to the normal regulation and function of diaphanous-related formins ; the domain c-terminal to dad is thought to influence both fh <dig> activity  <cit>  and autoregulation  <cit> . consistent with this, we find that auto-inhibition of pmr is less efficient than the other three isoforms and that tqs is the isoform most efficient at promoting invasion. beyond direct effects on fmnl <dig> activity, the drf c-terminus may also serve as a target for multiple regulatory and accessory factors  <cit> . indeed, a recent study investigating the role of fmnl <dig> in integrin trafficking found that the c-terminal tail of fmnl <dig> itm is a target of pkcα-dependent phosphorylation  <cit> . a comparison of the four fmnl <dig> isoforms on the eukaryotic linear motif resource  reveals that the pkcα site is conserved in the itm and yhy isoforms, but not in pmr or tqs. instead the tqs c-terminal tail contains consensus pkb and proline-directed kinase sites and pmr contains no conserved kinase consensus sites at all. this comparison suggests that the c-terminal tail of each isoform is likely to be targeted by a variety of differing upstream signaling pathways. determining how the prevalence of each isoform affects the integration of specific signaling pathways that regulate the effects of fmnl <dig> on cell behavior will be of great future interest.

CONCLUSIONS
we show here that fmnl <dig> expression is required for invasion in a <dig> and wm <dig>  melanoma cells and, taken with previous results, this suggests that fmnl <dig> is likely to be generally required by melanoma cells for invasion. at least four alternatively-spliced fmnl <dig> isoforms are expressed in primary melanocytes as well as in specific cancer cell-lines and sequence analysis of the encoded proteins suggests they will be targeted by distinct regulatory pathways. of the four isoforms, fmnl <dig> tqs is preferentially up-regulated in invasive crc and melanoma cell-lines and is the most efficient in supporting cellular invasion. this raises the possibility that tqs could be considered as an invasive isoform of fmnl <dig>  analogous to menainv and the invasive isoform of palladin. regardless, our results suggest that future studies on the role of fmnl <dig> in metastasis should concentrate on tqs as the most relevant isoform.
