BACKGROUND
the transcription factor pax <dig> is expressed dynamically during the early development of the mouse eye in both the surface ectoderm and the optic vesicle, which integrate to generate the structures of the eye  <cit> . as morphogenesis proceeds, pax <dig> is expressed in the lens, retinal pigment epithelium and retina  <cit> . most studies examining the functions of pax <dig> in eye development have exploited loss-of-function models. the optic cup fails to form in embryos completely lacking pax <dig>  <cit> . examination of pax6+/+ ↔ pax6-/- mouse chimeras has shown that pax <dig> is required cell autonomously in the optic vesicle for maintenance of contact with the overlying surface ectoderm, a necessary event in eye formation, providing a clue that pax <dig> may be involved in defining the adhesive properties of these cells  <cit> . heterozygous pax6+/- embryos show microphthalmia that is thought to be caused by delayed development of the lens and anterior eye structures  <cit> . data from pax6+/- ↔ pax6+/- chimeras has demonstrated that heterozygous cells have early cell autonomous deficiencies at lens placode formation and after closure of the lens pit  <cit> . studies using cre-lox technology to selectively disrupt pax <dig> in discrete parts of the developing eye have shown that removing pax <dig> from the developing surface ectoderm produces an eye lacking a lens but possessing a retina with retinal ganglion cells  able to project axons  <cit> . removing pax <dig> function after the retina forms results in a retina comprising mainly amacrine cells at the expense of other retinal cell types including rgcs  <cit> .

gain-of-function models are also useful for assessing gene function, particularly where, as in the case of pax <dig>  absence of function leads to complete abolition of a structure or cell type. in some parts of the developing brain pax <dig> has functions in axon guidance as well as in tissue morphogenesis and regulates genes implicated in growth cone navigation  <cit> . since absence of pax <dig> results in absence of rgcs, it is unclear whether pax <dig> has a role in the navigation of retinal axons. its expression by projecting rgcs  <cit>  indicates that it is poised to fulfil this function. here, we investigated the formation of the eye, retina and retinal projections in mice that over-express pax <dig> and we complemented our analysis of retinal projections in the gain-of-function model by studying retinal projections in pax6+/- embryos.

controlled overexpression of pax <dig> in its normal domains of expression has been achieved by the generation of a yac transgenic mouse expressing several copies of the human pax <dig> gene, which generates protein identical to mouse pax <dig>  under the control of all its regulatory elements  <cit> . pax <dig> hemizygous mice carry  <dig> to  <dig> copies of the human pax <dig> gene, all integrated at the same locus, and are designated pax77+  <cit> . pax <dig> homozygous transgenic mice are designated pax77+/+. schedl et al.  <cit>  showed that over-expression of pax <dig> causes microphthalmia in adults but did not study the development of this defect. here we show that the eye initially forms apparently normally but that retinal defects and microphthalmia emerge and become increasingly severe during subsequent embryogenesis and postnatal life. we also show that pax <dig> overexpression causes defects in rgc axon growth and guidance through the optic chiasm, where rgc axons are sorted into those that project ipsilaterally and those that project contralaterally. our results indicate that although both over- and under-expression of pax <dig> cause microphthalmia, the underlying mechanisms are different.

RESULTS
pax6/pax <dig> protein and mrna levels are increased in the eye of pax <dig> embryos
we compared pax6/pax <dig>  expression in wild-type and pax77+/+ eyes by immunohistochemistry on sections of e <dig>  and e <dig>  embryos. the pattern of expression of pax6/pax <dig> in the eye of pax77+/+ embryos reproduces that in the wild-types . as expected, the levels of pax6/pax <dig> in pax77+/+ eyes appear increased compared to those in wild-types . we also measured the levels of specifically mouse pax <dig> mrna and both mouse and human pax6/pax <dig> mrna in the retinae of e <dig>  wild-type and pax77+/+ embryos by quantitative rt-pcr . we found that the total levels of pax6/pax <dig> mrna are increased by about  <dig>  fold in pax77+/+ compared to wild-type retinae . this increase is lower than might be expected from the increase in gene copy number , suggesting that pax <dig> negatively autoregulates in the retina, as it does in the brain  <cit> . in agreement with this, we found that the levels of endogenous mouse pax <dig> mrna are decreased in pax77+/+ retinae compared to wild-type retinae , indicating that overproduction of pax <dig> from the yac transgenes represses production from the endogenous pax <dig> loci. for convenience, we refer elsewhere in this paper to the overexpression in pax <dig> mice as being an overproduction of pax <dig>  rather than pax6/pax <dig>  since the human and mouse protein sequences are identical.

eye development until e <dig>  is similar in wild-type and pax6-overexpressing embryos
at early stages of embryogenesis, up to e <dig> , the eyes of pax77+/+ embryos appear similar to those of the wild-types in both size and morphology . they do not show the lens defects reported in pax6+/- embryos at this age  <cit> . we tested for more subtle defects of cell proliferation and death at this age but found no evidence for either. we used the technique of sequential labeling of cells in s-phase with brdu and idu  <cit>  to estimate the cell-cycle length  and the length of the s-phase  of retinal progenitors . we did not find any significant difference in the estimated ts  or tc  in the proximal and distal retina of e <dig>  pax77+/+ embryos compared to wild-types . we performed an analysis of cell death in the retina by examining the pattern of dying cells clearly visible on thin plastic sections as pyknotic nuclei. pyknosis is the most characteristic feature of apoptosis and counting pyknotic nuclei is a standard way of looking at cell death in the retina  <cit> . in a previous study we counted apoptotic cells in the brain by counting pyknotic nuclei as well as by counting terminal uridine deoxynucleotidyl transferase dutp nick end labeling  positive cells and found that both techniques gave the same result  <cit> .we did not observe any obvious increase in the number of pyknotic figures per  <dig> μm section through the eye of e <dig>  pax77+/+ embryos compared to wild-types. in sections from eyes of both genotypes there were between  <dig> and  <dig> pyknotic figures per section. thus, there does not appear to be a dysregulation of progenitor proliferation and death at early stages of retinogenesis in pax77+/+ embryos.

overexpression of pax <dig> results in optic disc malformations, progressive retinal dysplasia and microphthalmia from e <dig> 
as development progresses pax77+/+ retinae become progressively smaller than normal while the size and appearance of their lenses appears relatively less affected . as a consequence, from postnatal day   <dig> their vitreous chambers have almost completely disappeared and parts of their retinae and lenses are in direct contact .

morphological defects are first detected at e <dig>  with the development of persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous , a condition that arises when the hyaloid canal does not retract appropriately towards the optic nerve head leaving a tissue nodule   <cit> , and malformations of the optic disc . at this stage in the wild-type, the pigmented epithelium  and the retinal neuroepithelium stop sharply at the junction of the optic cup and optic stalk, whereas in the mutant, cells continuous with those of pigmented epithelium and neural retinal cells extend along the optic stalk . taken together, these results indicate that failure of the optic nerve head to develop normally is an early feature in pax77+/+ embryos. defects of rgc axons at around this time are analysed in greater detail below.

by e <dig>  the retinae of pax77+/+ eyes have become significantly smaller than those of the wild-type eyes  and the iris appears folded and pushed against the lens epithelium . at e <dig> , the wild-type retina comprises two well-defined layers. the inner layer is the differentiated rgc layer and the outer layer is the region of the retina that is still primarily neuroblastic. while both layers are present in the mutant retina, the rgc layer appears to be less structured than in the wild-type retina . four days after birth, when normal neuronal production is declining rapidly and the retina is initiating the differentiation of the inner and outer nuclear layers, rosette-like structures are starting to form in the outer layer of the retina of pax77+/+ mice . in addition, the peripheral retina is folded back towards what remains of the vitreous chamber and retinal folds appear more centrally . at p <dig>  pax77+/+ retinae display degrees of rosetting that vary between eyes and also between different regions of the same eye. figures 2f and 2l show a pax77+/+ eye at p <dig> with very severe rosetting. in all p <dig> pax77+/+ eyes examined the entire outer nuclear layer consisted of dysplastic rosettes  and the retina displayed extensive gliosis .

the abnormality of the optic disc observed in the mutant embryos from e <dig>  is similar to that previously described in mice heterozygous for the kidney and retinal defects  deletion, which display haploinsufficiency of the transcription factor pax <dig>  <cit> . we could not, however, detect by immunofluorescence any obvious difference in the pattern or the level of expression of pax <dig> in the eyes of pax77+/+ embryos compared to wild-types .

analysis of patterns of gene expression in the retinae of pax77+/+ and wild-type mice
in the retina of wild-types aged e <dig> , proliferative cells are found in the outer layer while the inner layer contains the recently differentiated rgcs. we analyzed the organization of the retina at e <dig>  using brn3a  as a marker of rgcs  <cit>  and brdu to label proliferative cells in s-phase . there are no obvious differences in the positions and densities of cells labelled with brdu or brn3a between pax77+/+ and wild-type retina . a further quantitative analysis of brn3a labelling in wild-type and mutant embryos, presented below in the context of rgc axonal development, supported these findings. thus, at e <dig> , although the pax77+/+ retina is smaller than the wild-type retina, its organization appears to be normal.

we analyzed the expression of a broader range of markers in the postnatal retina, at p <dig>  the rgcs, which express pax <dig>  islet <dig> and brn3a  <cit> , are present in the mutant retina but they are not as regularly aligned as in the wild-type retina . pax <dig>  islet <dig> and syntaxin are expressed by amacrine cells  <cit>  , chx <dig> is a marker of bipolar and retinal progenitor cells  <cit>   and pax <dig> and r-cadherin are expressed by horizontal cells  <cit>  . analysis of the expression of these markers in pax77+/+ retina provided evidence that all the major cell types of the inner nuclear layer are produced in the mutant, but their appearances and distributions are not normal at p <dig>  cells expressing markers associated with cells from the inner nuclear layer accumulate at the outer surface of the retina ; their appearance suggests that they might have migrated through the outer nuclear layer. in addition, there seem to be fewer horizontal cells in the pax77+/+ retina than in the wild-type retina and they are not as regularly spaced . in the wild-type retina, r-cadherin is strongly expressed in the outer plexiform layer, which contains the horizontal cells' dendrites . the expression of r-cadherin in the outer plexiform layer of the mutant retina is much weaker and does not appear as a continuous line as in the wild-type . this suggests that the horizontal cells in the mutant retina do not form normal dendritic connections with cells in the outer nuclear layer. in the wild-type retina, the outer limiting membrane is strongly stained by antibodies against n-cadherin  <cit>  . the outer limiting membrane in the pax77+/+ eye is not as clearly defined as in the wild-type and it appears discontinuous . overall, these results indicate that the major cell types of the normal retina are produced in the mutants but they are disorganized at p <dig> 

we used real time quantitative rt-pcr to analyze the mrna levels of several genes which are implicated in retina formation and rgc axon navigation and some of which are known targets of regulation by pax <dig>  we compared the mrna levels of our candidates in the retinae of wild-type and pax77+/+ embryos at e <dig>  and e <dig> , stages at which retinal dysmorphology first emerges in the mutants . shh, which is expressed specifically by the rgcs  <cit> , is implicated in retinal lamination and rgc axon guidance  <cit> . we found a small, significant decrease in the levels of shh mrna in the pax77+/+ retinae compared to the wild-types at e <dig>  . we also analyzed the expression of the adhesion molecules ncam, r-cadherin and l <dig> which are implicated in axon growth and guidance and are transcriptional targets of pax <dig>  <cit> . l <dig>  in particular, is essential for topographic mapping of retinal axons  <cit> . we did not detect any difference in expression of these genes in the pax77+/+ retina compared to the wild-type. the homeodomain transcription factor six <dig> is an important regulator of retinal development and may regulate retinal progenitor proliferation and cell fate specification  <cit> . there is evidence that the expression of six <dig> is regulated by pax <dig>  <cit> . the bhlh transcription factor ngn <dig> has been implicated in the regulation of the specification of rgcs  <cit>  and is a transcriptional target of pax <dig> in the telencephalon and spinal chord  <cit> . the expression of six <dig> and ngn <dig> was not significantly altered in the pax77+/+ compared to the wild-type retina.

shh mrna levels are slightly decreased in the retinae of e <dig>  pax77+/+ embryos compared to the wild-types. mrna levels of potential targets of pax <dig> in the retina of e <dig>  or e <dig>  pax77+/+ embryos, relative to wild-type, determined by real time quantitative rt-pcr and normalised against gapdh mrna levels . p values were given by student's t-test.

overexpression of pax <dig> results in intraretinal and retinothalamic errors in rgc axon navigation
in order to test the hypothesis that normal levels of pax <dig> are important for the proper navigation of rgc axons we first examined the ability of rgc axons to navigate within the pax77+/+ retina. we looked at e <dig>  retinae as, by this age in wild-types, large numbers of rgc axons have grown to the optic nerve head and any defects in intraretinal navigation in mutants would be apparent. in wild-type embryos, rgc axons grow radially towards the optic nerve head as revealed by immunostaining rgc axons for l <dig>  or neurofilament , or labelling cohorts of rgc axons by dii injection into the peripheral retina . in contrast, in pax77+/+ embryos rgc axons take a more erratic path. l <dig>  and neurofilament  immunostaining showed that, as in the wild-type, rgc axons form bundles that converge on the optic nerve head. however, whereas in the wild-type these bundles run approximately linearly and cover the retinal surface evenly, in the pax77+/+ embryo they take a more serpentine course and are not evenly distributed across the retinal surface. focal dii injections labelling cohorts of rgc axons  showed that although many axons do converge on the optic nerve head their course is erratic.

despite exhibiting abnormal routing within the retina, a significant number of rgc axons exit the retina at the optic nerve head and grow into the optic stalk in pax77+/+ embryos. during normal development the optic nerves converge on the ventral surface of the hypothalamus to form the optic chiasm. axons are then sorted into the contralateral or ipsilateral optic tracts and navigate to their targets in the thalamus and superior colliculus. immunostaining for pax <dig> in wild-type  and pax77+/+  embryos shows that pax <dig> is not expressed at detectable levels at the optic chiasm at e <dig> , the age at which rgc axons are navigating this region. horizontal sections of wild-type  and pax77+/+  optic chiasm following dii injection into the retina reveal that in both cases significant numbers of axons reach the chiasm and continue into the optic tracts. we noticed that our injections consistently labelled more axons in the wild-type than in the pax77+/+ embryos suggesting that fewer axons reached this region in the pax77+/+ embryos. in order to quantify this we counted the numbers of rgc cell bodies retrogradely labelled by unilateral dii injection into the thalamus at e <dig>  . these counts confirmed our initial observation that the pax77+/+ retina projects fewer axons to the thalamus: the total number of back-labelled rgcs in the pax77+/+ retina was reduced compared to the wild-type . interestingly, however, there was a disproportionate reduction in the contralateral projection which was reduced by 90% in the pax77+/+ embryos  compared to the ipsilateral projection in which there was no significant decrease . this is examined in more detail below.

the number of rgcs in the retina is sensitive to pax <dig> gene dosage
we studied whether the reduction in the number of rgcs labelled by dii from the thalamus in pax77+/+ mutants could be accounted for by a reduction in the total number of rgcs in the mutant retina. in view of the interesting observation that there was a disproportionate reduction in the contralateral projection in pax77+/+ mutants, we extended the study to include embryos with a range of pax <dig> gene dosage. we counted the total number of rgcs, marked by expression of brn3a, in whole e <dig>  retinae from pax6sey/+, pax6+/+, pax77+, and pax77+/+ embryos. this analysis showed that all three types of mutant retina produced about a third fewer brn3a-expressing rgcs than the wild-type  although there was no significant difference between the mutant genotypes. this reduction in rgc number was accounted for by the reduction in retinal area in pax6sey/+, pax77+, and pax77+/+ embryos as the density of brn3a-expressing cells in the rgc layer and the depth of the rgc layer were similar in pax6sey/+, pax6+/+, pax77+, and pax77+/+ embryos . there was no significant difference in the density of brn3a-expressing cells between ventro-temporal and dorso-nasal retina for each genotype , indicating that the relatively even distribution of rgcs over the retinal surface seen in wild-types is maintained in all three types of mutant.
numbers and distributions of brn3a expressing rgcs in pax6sey/+, pax6+/+, pax77+, and pax77+/+ embryos. note that the reduced number of brn3a-expressing cells in the pax6sey/+, pax77+, and pax77+/+ embryos compared to pax6+/+ embryos  appears to correspond to a reduction in retinal area  as opposed to changes in the density or distribution of brn3a-expressing cells in the retina. all values mean ± s.e.m. sample sizes: pax6sey/+ n = 5; pax6+/+ n = 4; pax77+ n = 3; pax77+/+ n =  <dig>  abbreviations: dn, dorsonasal quadrant; vt, ventrotemporal quadrant.

the reduced number of rgcs at e <dig>  resulting from pax <dig> overexpression raises the possibility that the onset of ganglion cell differentiation may be delayed. we therefore examined the number and distribution of brn3a expressing cells at the onset of rgc differentiation  <cit>  in e <dig>  retinae of pax6+/+, pax77+, and pax77+/+ embryos . we found no differences in the distribution  or number  of brn3a positive cells between the three genotypes. we conclude that the retinal axon guidance defects caused by pax <dig> overexpression do not arise from delayed onset of rgc differentiation.

the midline crossing behaviour of rgc axons at the optic chiasm is sensitive to pax <dig> gene dosage
rgc axons are sorted into the optic tracts at the optic chiasm. in wild-type mice about 3% do not cross the midline and grow into the ipsilateral optic tract. the remaining 97% cross the midline and grow into the contralateral optic tract. in pax77+/+ embryos the increased levels of pax <dig> correlate with an increase in the proportion of rgcs projecting ipsilaterally. in order to investigate the relationship between pax <dig> and the ipsilateral projection in more detail we examined other lines of mice with different numbers of pax6/pax <dig> gene copies.

small-eye heterozygote  embryos have only one functional copy of pax <dig>  <cit> . loss of one functional copy of pax <dig> in pax6neu/+ embryos produces a hypoplastic optic nerve  <cit> . quantification of rgcs retrogradely labelled by unilateral dii injection into the thalamus confirm that the total projection in pax6sey/+ embryos is reduced to 12%  of that seen in wild-types . in contrast to the pax77+/+ embryos, however, the reduction affects ipsilateral and contralateral projections equally and the proportion of rgcs projecting ipsilaterally is 3%, not significantly different to the  <dig> % in the wild-type . reducing the number of functional pax <dig> gene copies reduces the number of rgc axons projected by the retina to the thalamus but does not affect the proportion that cross the midline at the optic chiasm. thus, reduction in the number of rgcs, which occurs in both pax6sey/+ and pax77+/+ embryos, is not sufficient to explain the increased proportion of ipsilateral projections in pax77+/+ mutants, which must be regulated separately by gene dosage.

pax77+ hemizygotes  <cit>  contain  <dig> to  <dig> copies of human pax <dig> in addition to the two endogenous mouse pax <dig> genes. the pax6/pax <dig> gene dosage in these embryos is therefore intermediate between wild-type embryos and pax77+/+ embryos  <cit> . quantification of rgcs retrogradely labelled by unilateral dii injection into the thalamus showed no significant difference in the overall numbers of rgcs projecting into the brain compared to wild-types , even though the total number of brn3a-expressing rgcs was less than in wild-types . the proportion of rgcs projecting ipsilaterally was about 10%, significantly more than the  <dig> % seen in wild-types . as described above, in pax77+/+ embryos there is a significant reduction of the total projection to 10% of its normal size  of which 11% is ipsilateral, a significant increase compared to the wild type ipsilateral projection . the tendency of ipsilaterally projecting rgcs to be most concentrated in the ventro-temporal retina, which has been well established in pax6+/+ embryos , was maintained in pax6sey/+, pax77+, and pax77+/+ embryos  irrespective of the changes in the total number or proportion of ipsilaterally projecting rgcs. these results, summarised in fig 8d, show that increasing the number of functional pax <dig> gene copies increases the proportion of rgc axons projecting ipsilaterally independently of its effect on the total numbers of rgcs whose axons reach the thalamus.

discussion
we analyzed the effects of pax <dig> overexpression on the development of the neural retina and on its ability to project axons to the brain. our results indicate that, in the eye of pax77+/+ embryos,  development proceeds normally until about e <dig> ,  the first defects, which are of the optic nerve and the growth and navigation of rgc axons, emerge at e <dig> –e <dig> ,  major retinal cell types are generated and  there is progressive retinal dysplasia and microphthalmia from e <dig>  into postnatal life. the globe and retina fail to grow and by p <dig> the vitreous has almost disappeared leaving the retina in contact with the lens. retinal lamination is also affected with the appearance of many rosettes and abnormal horizontal cells. one clear conclusion from these findings is that while both over- and under-expression of pax <dig> cause microphthalmia, the underlying mechanisms are different. microphthalmia in pax6sey/+ mice is thought to be caused by primary defects of the lens and anterior structures occurring at the time of initial eye formation rather than with later retinal defects  <cit> .

possible causes of intraretinal rgc axonal defects
during normal development rgc axons initially grow straight towards the optic nerve head. overexpression of pax <dig> does not prevent rgc axons converging on the optic nerve head altogether, but does cause a substantial proportion to take a less direct route than normal. the intraretinal navigation defects occur before e <dig> , when the morphology of the pax77+/+ retina is not grossly abnormal, making it less likely that the distorted rgc axons are a secondary consequence of retinal dysplasia. intraretinal axon navigation defects have been reported in mice lacking the secreted axon guidance molecules slit <dig> and/or slit <dig>  <cit>  or the cell surface receptors ephb <dig> and ephb <dig>  <cit> , or netrin <dig> and its receptor dcc   <cit> . although these loss-of-function phenotypes do not precisely phenocopy the pax77+/+ phenotype reported here, it is possible that pax <dig> normally regulates the expression of one or more of these molecules and that its overexpression alters their normal balance resulting in the intraretinal axon guidance defects we observed. as pax <dig> is expressed by rgcs themselves, and by other retinal cell types, it is possible that the intraretinal pathfinding errors reflect sensitivity of the rgc growth cone and/or the environment through which it navigates to levels of pax <dig>  it has recently been postulated that the lens directs rgc axons towards the optic nerve head by secreting repulsive slit molecules  <cit> . as pax <dig> plays a role in the formation of the lens  <cit> , and overexpressing pax <dig> causes defects in lens development  <cit> , it is quite possible that overexpression of pax <dig> in the lens is directly responsible for a component of the intraretinal misrouting. the proper formation of the optic nerve head is also important for intraretinal axon navigation  <cit>  and its altered structure in pax77+/+ embryos could influence axon navigation.

possible causes of rgc axonal defects at the optic chiasm
retinal axon navigation at the optic chiasm is controlled by genes ranging from transcription factors  <cit>  to cell surface and secreted proteins  <cit> . manipulating a small subset of these genes produces specific alterations to chiasm organisation . this complex genetic control may underlie variations in the details of chiasm construction between vertebrate species. in mice the vast majority of retinal axons cross the ventral midline at the optic chiasm and join the contralateral optic tract growing towards their targets in the thalamus and superior colliculus whereas a minority do not cross and join the ipsilateral tract  <cit> . to date only a small number of transcription factors have been identified which control the balance between ipsilateral and contralateral projections . a study of chick retina identified a gradient of pax <dig> expression levels consistent with a role in topographic mapping of rgc axons via regulation of the expression of the axon guidance receptor ephb <dig>  <cit> . as signalling between ephb receptors and their ephrinb ligands have been implicated in axon crossing behaviour at the chiasm  <cit> , it is possible that the regulation of ephb by pax <dig> is conserved between chick and mouse and that overexpressing pax <dig> alters the expression of ephb receptors on rgc growth cones and influences their midline crossing behaviour at the chiasm.

to investigate the relationship between pax <dig> levels and rgc axon navigation at the optic chiasm we examined an allelic series of genotypes with different pax6/pax <dig> gene dosage. overexpression of pax <dig> resulted in an increase in the proportion of rgcs projecting ipsilaterally combined with either no change in the total number projecting  or with a reduction in the total numbers projecting . conversely a reduction in the total numbers projecting occurred without changing the proportion of the ipsilateral projection in the pax6sey/+ phenotype. this provides strong evidence that the increased proportion of ipsilaterally projecting axons in pax77+/+ embryos is not simply a consequence of a reduced total projection. as pax <dig> is expressed by rgcs at the time their axons navigate the midline but not by chiasm cells at the midline it is likely that pax <dig> levels in the rgcs themselves are important in defining the navigational properties of their growth cones. pax <dig> overexpression might increase rgc axon growth cones' sensitivity to repulsive guidance cues at the chiasm  <cit> , therefore reducing the proportion that will cross the midline and project contralaterally. this might occur either directly by regulation of axon guidance molecules, such as ephb <dig>  <cit> , or indirectly by regulation of transcription factors, such as zic <dig>  <cit> , which program an rgc to project ipsilaterally. in either case this is the first evidence that pax <dig> acts as an 'ipsilateral determinant' in its own right.

brn3a is expressed by a large population of rgcs innervating the principal retinothalamic and retinocollicular pathway  <cit>  so is a useful marker for determining whether the size of the population of rgcs that would normally project to the thalamus is affected when pax6/pax <dig> dosage is altered. rgcs projecting to ipsilateral targets in the thalamus and superior colliculus do not express brn3a whereas contralateral projecting rgcs do, indicating that brn3a expressing rgcs tend to project contralaterally  <cit> . embryos either underexpressing or overexpressing pax6/pax <dig> have similar numbers of brn3a expressing rgcs but different numbers projecting to the ipsilateral and contalateral thalamus indicating that in our models alterations of the size of the ipsilateral or contralateral projection cannot be explained by variations in the numbers of cells expressing brn3a. the total numbers of brn3a-expressing rgcs produced by pax6sey/+, pax77+, and pax77+/+ embryos at e <dig>  were very similar to one another, although in all cases about 30% less than in pax6+/+ embryos. the earliest rgc projection is a transient ipsilateral projection from the dorsocentral retina at e <dig>   <cit> . as pax <dig> overexpression does not affect the number or dorsocentral location of brn3a expressing rgcs at e <dig> , it is extremely unlikely that the increased ipsilateral projection following pax <dig> overexpression is simply a consequence of delayed retinal development. the 90% reduction in the total numbers of rgcs projecting to the thalamus in pax6sey/+ and pax77+/+ embryos cannot be accounted for by a failure to generate rgcs but must be caused by axons failing to get to the thalamus, for example by wandering around in the retina, as seen in pax77+/+ embryos. it is possible that some rgcs fail to project axons out of the retina because they have a defect in axonogenesis like that seen when rgcs lack the transcription factor brn3b  <cit> .

possible causes of early defects of optic nerve head
pax <dig> is initially co-expressed with pax <dig> in the early optic stalk before becoming restricted to the optic cup by e <dig> . baumer et al.  <cit>  have shown that maintaining the expression of pax <dig> in the optic stalk after e <dig> , by expressing pax <dig> under the control of a pax2-upstream promoter fragment, results in the appearance of retinal pigmented epithelium  in the optic disc, which is one of the earliest abnormalities detected in pax77+/+ e <dig>  embryos. although we did not detect pax <dig> in the optic stalk of pax77+/+ mice after e <dig> , it is possible that its overexpression causes a slight delay in its downregulation in the optic stalk. such a delay could be responsible for the ectopic presence of rpe and retinal cells in the optic disc.

the malformation of the optic disc in pax77+/+ embryos could arise as a consequence of the abnormal development of rgc axons. alternatively, the defects of rgc axon guidance might be secondary to primary defects at the optic nerve head. in this study we show that, at e <dig> , rgcs display axon guidance defects and the levels of shh mrna, specifically expressed by the rgcs  <cit> , are slightly lower than normal. previous studies have shown that shh, expressed by the rgcs, is implicated in retinal lamination and rgc axon guidance. conditional inactivation of shh in rgcs causes a complete loss of optic disc astrocyte precursor cells, resulting in defective axon guidance in the retina, as well as conversion of the neuroepithelial cells in the optic stalk to pigmented cells  <cit> . loss of rgc-derived shh also causes extensive disorganization of the retina with the appearance of many rosettes in the outer nuclear layer  <cit> . thus, the slight decrease in shh expression found in the mutant retina at e <dig>  could reflect abnormalities in rgc differentiation and could contribute to the defects in rgc axon guidance and retinal lamination observed in the pax <dig> retina.

in addition, another study has shown that specific ablation of newly formed rgcs results in a decrease of retinal progenitor cell proliferation and abnormally thin retinal layers in the postnatal eye  <cit> . thus, a defect in rgc differentiation could also account for the reduced size of the retina in pax77+/+mice. the fact that major retinal defects appear after rgc defects in axon guidance and shh expression supports the hypothesis that microphthalmia and retinal dysplasia in pax77+/+ eyes could be secondary to earlier abnormalities in rgc differentiation caused by pax <dig> overexpression.

CONCLUSIONS
higher than normal levels of pax <dig> produce complex phenotypes in which several features of eye morphogenesis are affected. both increased  and decreased  <cit> pax <dig> gene dosage result in defective eye development, but the effects are quite different. whereas defects of pax6+/- mice occur mainly in the anterior segment of the eye  <cit> , we show here that overexpression of pax <dig> causes major defects of retinal development. increased pax <dig> levels also affect the projection of retinal axons. since retinal axon navigation generally follows eye morphogenesis it is possible that a component of the intraretinal guidance errors we detect is a secondary consequence of alterations in retinal, lens, and/or optic disc anatomy or molecular composition. the navigation errors we detect at the chiasm are likely to reflect a requirement for normal pax <dig> levels in programming the responses of rgcs to guidance cues at the chiasm.
