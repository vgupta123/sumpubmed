BACKGROUND
the mouse lymphoma assay  is used internationally for regulatory decision-making and it is the mammalian in vitro gene mutation assay preferred by the u.s. fda, the u.s. epa, and the international committee on harmonization   <cit> . the mla is conducted using an l5178y cell line that is heterozygous for the tk gene. the assay detects forward mutation of the wild-type tk allele  located on mouse chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . in this assay, tk-deficient  mutants of the l5178y/tk+/- mouse lymphoma cells are selected by the pyrimidine analog trifluorothymidine  because tft inhibits division of the tk competent  cells that are capable of incorporating tft into the dna. the mutant cells cannot incorporate tft into their dna because of the tk gene deficiency. therefore, the mutants can grow and develop into colonies in the selective growth medium while the tk-competent cells are growth arrested and do not divide.

a striking feature of the tk mutant colonies recovered in the mla is the presence of two size classes of mutants. immediately following their isolation, the cells in the large colonies grow at a normal rate, while cells in the small colonies grow slowly. the relative frequency of the two colony classes is mutagen dependent. generally, clastogens induce more small colony mutants while point mutagens induce more large colony mutants  <cit> . it should be noted that many chemicals induce both small and large colony mutants.

it is important to obtain definitive information concerning the underlying molecular basis for the small and large colony mutant phenotype. this can be particularly important in a regulatory context. there is increasing interest in distinguishing between chemicals that cause point mutations and those that cause chromosomal mutants. the small and large colony tk mutant phenotype was identified more than  <dig> years ago and there have been several hypotheses proposed to explain the difference between these two mutant types. the first one suggested that the small-colony mutants result from large scale damage to the chromosome 11b on which the tk+ allele resides while large-colony mutants result from mutational events affecting the expression of only the tk gene  <cit> . this hypothesis was expanded to state that small colony mutants are the consequence of intergenic lesions affecting the tk gene and other putative growth control gene that may or may not be on chromosome  <dig>  large colony mutants are the consequence of either intragenic lesions limited to the tk gene or intergenic lesions that do not affect the growth control gene  <cit> . so far, the growth control gene or genes have not been identified. further analysis using microsatellite markers on chromosome  <dig> demonstrated that both large and small colony mutants can apparently have relatively large alterations of chromosome 11b  <cit> . also, it is clear that the entire chromosome 11b is lost in some large colony mutants  <cit> . another possible hypothesis, demonstrated in other cell types, invokes a process of chromosome damage and repair. in this model, a cell with chromosome damage would suffer arrested growth until the cell repairs the damage  <cit> . none of these hypotheses, however, can fully explain the difference between the small and large colony phenotypes because the molecular analysis of mutants  does not reveal a clear cut distinction in the degree of "damage" between small and large colony mutants. that is, the fundamental mechanistic difference between the small and large colony mutant phenotypes has not been elucidated using the available analytical techniques.

the advent of gene microarrays permits the analysis of gene expression for thousands of genes simultaneously in biological samples of interest, permitting functional interpretation of the transcriptome state of any given cell type at a particular physiologic state  <cit> . these cellular mrna expression profiles yield global genomic fingerprints that identify the biological state of that cell. molecular profiling has rapidly become an effective approach to further understanding of the phenotypes of tumor cells  <cit> . because the colony size of tk mutants is determined by the growth rate of mutant cells, it would be expected that there would be some difference in the expression levels of one or more specific growth regulation genes. microarray analysis should allow us to measure gene expression in large and small colony mutants and discern possible mechanisms that lead to the two phenotypes based on the differences between the gene expression profiles.

arraytrack software developed at the national center for toxicological research provides an integrated solution for managing, analyzing, and interpreting microarray gene expression data. it is miame  supportive for storing both microarray data and experiment parameters associated with a pharmacogenomics or toxicogenomics study. using arraytrack, users can easily select a normalization method and a statistical method applied to a stored microarray dataset to cluster genes into different groups according to expression profiles, to determine a list of differentially expressed genes , and to link the gene list directly to pathways and gene ontology for functional analysis. arraytrack is being integrated and further refined at the u.s. fda as a review tool for the pharmacogenomics data submission program . arraytrack is also freely available to public  <cit> .

in this study, previously isolated small and large tk mutants were evaluated for differences in gene expression using microarray technology. we used this approach to address the following  <dig> questions:  whether microarray analysis using arraytrack could distinguish the two tk mutant phenotypes;  whether microarray analysis could identify candidate genes that might contribute to the phenotype difference;  whether genes altered in their expression might be localized on chromosome  <dig> near the tk gene; and  whether the results might provide insight into the underlying mechanisms responsible for the two types of mutants. for this analysis, we selected  <dig> small and  <dig> large colony mutant samples from a previously conducted 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine -treatment  <cit> . these mutants were selected because they all showed the same microsatellite pattern. they were loh for both tk and d11mit <dig> . we used this strategy for the mutant selection so that we could determine if the microarray approach, which evaluates individual gene expression, would provide a level of resolution not provided by the microsatellite analysis. we found that microarray analysis using arraytrack distinguished the two different cellular phenotypes and identified a set of candidate genes that are responsible for the colony size phenotypes. also, the expression of a high proportion of genes located near the tk gene on chromosome  <dig> was differentially altered between the large and small colony mutant samples, which might be the original reason for the formation of two different sizes of colony mutants.

materials and methods
cells and culture conditions
l5178y/tk+/-- <dig> .2c mouse lymphoma tk-deficient mutants were grown according to the methods described by chen and moore  <cit> . briefly, the basic medium was fischer's medium for leukemic cells of mice with l-glutamine  supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, pluronic f <dig> , sodium pyruvate , penicillin , and streptomycin . the cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% co <dig> in air at 37°c. unless otherwise noted, all culture supplies were purchased from invitrogen life technologies .

selection of large and small colony tk mutants and expansion of mutant cells
large and small colony mutants were selected from a series of mutants isolated following azt treatment  <cit> . an example of large and small colonies in selective medium in 96-well plates is shown in figure  <dig>  the mutants were selected based on the considerations described in the introduction. all mutants showed the same microsatellite loh pattern  indicating that the chromosome alteration might occur at the tk locus and extend up to  <dig>  cm.

in addition, only mutants whose growth rates were relatively stable were chosen for microarray analysis of gene expression. the average doubling time for the large colony mutants was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hours while the average doubling time for the small colony mutants was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hours .

rna isolation and cdna labeling
total rna was extracted from mutants whose cells were collected at log stage of growth using qiagen rneasy kits with on-column dnase digestion. the concentration and quality of rna samples were measured by a spectrophotometer and an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer . all the rna samples were stored at -80°c until used for microarray analysis.

the aminoallyl-indirect labeling protocol by the institute for genomic research  was followed with a few modifications. briefly,  <dig> μg of total rna was primed with  <dig> μg of random hexamer primers  in a final volume of  <dig>  μl. the rna was reverse-transcribed in a  <dig> μl reaction containing  <dig>  mm datp, dctp, dgtp,  <dig>  mm dttp  and  <dig>  mm aminoallyl-dutp ,  <dig> u rnase inhibitor ,  <dig> u superscript ii ,  <dig> mm dtt and 1x first strand buffer at 42°c for  <dig> hours to generate aminoallyl-labeled cdna. the purified aminoallyl-cdna was coupled with either cy <dig> or cy <dig> monoreactive dyes . uncoupled dyes were removed by qiaquick pcr purification kit. cdna yields and dye incorporation efficiencies were determined using a nanodrop spectrophotometer. a reference design was used in which rna sample from each large or small colony mutant was labeled with cy <dig> and paired with mouse universal reference rna  labeled with cy <dig> 

hybridization and imaging
pairs of cy <dig> and cy <dig> labeled cdnas were dissolved in  <dig> μl of hybridization buffer  and incubated with a mouse  <dig> k oligonucleotide microarray that was fabricated in-house at the nctr using oligonucleotides from mwg, inc. . the hybridization was performed in hybridization cassettes  in a water bath at 50°c for 16– <dig> hours. the slides were then washed in pre-warmed  2x ssc  for  <dig> minutes, 1x ssc for  <dig> minutes, and  <dig> x ssc for  <dig> minutes. the hybridized slides were dried immediately by centrifugation and scanned with a genepix 4000b scanner  at  <dig> μm resolution. the resulting images were analyzed by measuring the fluorescence of all features on the slides using the genepix pro  <dig>  software . the median fluorescence intensity of all the pixels within one feature was taken as the intensity value for each feature.

data analysis
the raw data were imported into arraytrack  and normalized using total intensity normalization after subtracting backgrounds. expression ratios  from  <dig> arrays  were log2-transformed. the logged data were used for principal component analysis , hierarchical cluster analysis , and statistical analysis for identifying genes that were differentially expressed in large versus small colony mutants. the welch t-test was used for determining significant changes in gene expression between the large and small colony mutant groups. significant genes were selected with a cut-off of p <  <dig>  and fold change >  <dig> . the selected genes were further analyzed for their functions and networks using ingenuity pathway analysis . information on genes' chromosome locations were obtained using gene library within arraytrack.

RESULTS
principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering of the gene expression profiles
genome-wide expression profiles for  <dig> tk mutant samples were generated using the mouse oligonucleotide microarray. principal components analysis  within arraytrack was used to carry out an examination of the relationship among the samples . a separation between large and small colony mutants was clearly observed. the large colonies are more tightly grouped together while the small colonies more loosely grouped. hierarchical cluster analysis  using arraytrack also revealed distinct grouping of the mutant samples according to their colony size, suggesting that gene expression patterns are different between the large and small colony mutants .

identification of differentially expressed genes between large and small colony tk mutants
welch t-test was used for determining significant changes in gene expression between large and small colony mutant groups. a volcano plot for differentially expressed genes between large and small colony mutants is shown in figure  <dig>  a group of  <dig> genes was found to be differentially expressed with a cutoff . among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated when the gene expression ratios in large colony mutants were compared to those in small colony mutants . a complete list of these genes can be found in table  <dig>  there were  <dig> genes whose p-value was smaller than  <dig>  without fold-change cutoff and  <dig> genes that have a fold-change greater than  <dig>  without considering the p-value.

pathway analysis of the significant genes
the selected genes were analyzed for their functions using ipa that is integrated with arraytrack. among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes were mapped to the ipa database and were used for functional analysis. the  <dig> genes were mapped to four different networks in the ipa database . the scores for all of the mapped networks were higher than  <dig>  indicating that the networks selected were not due to random chance alone. . these networks were associated with the following pathways: gene expression, cell signaling, lymphatic system development and function, cellular growth and proliferation, cell death and cancer.

significant genes located on chromosome 11
the mouse lymphoma mutants are identified and isolated because they have mutation that involve the tk gene that is located at the distal end of chromosome  <dig>  the mutation can occur solely within the tk gene or it may also involve other genes on chromosome  <dig>  while the underlying difference between the small and large colony mutants has remained elusive, it is clear that the slow growth of the small colony mutants must be caused by an alteration in the expression of one or more genes related to cell growth. it is expected that one or more genes located near the tk gene on chromosome  <dig> may have differential expression in large and small colony mutants because of an alteration of the dna in the region around the tk gene. the gene library feature of arraytrack was used to identify the significant genes located on chromosome  <dig>  among  <dig> significant genes,  <dig> of them were found to be located on chromosome  <dig> . interestingly, all these genes had a higher gene expression in small colony mutants than in large colony mutants . among the total genes  in the array, about  <dig> % of them are located on chromosome  <dig> and no bias for up or down-regulation of genes was found.

discussion
the large and small colony tk mutants differ in their growth kinetics. the cells from the small colony mutants grow slowly while the cells from large colony mutants grow at normal rates  <cit> . the relative proportion of these two classes of mutants is mutagen dependent and relates to the clastogenic, anuploidogenic and recombinogenic potential of the chemical. despite extensive molecular genetic and cytogenetic evaluation of a large number of mutants, the fundamental mechanistic difference between the two phenotypes is not known. to explore the biological difference between the two types of tk mutants, four large colony mutant samples with an average doubling time of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hours and four small colony mutant samples with an average doubling time of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hours were examined by microarray gene expression analysis.

pca and hca of the gene expression profiles from these mutant samples showed that the samples were clearly separated into two groups based on their phenotype of colony sizes. given that both pca and hca were conducted using all of the genes on the microarray  without filtering, this finding is very significant, indicating a high quality of the microarray experiment and strong biological relevance. the results can be interpreted as evidence for the biological similarity within each size group and biological differences between the two different size colony mutants. also the results from pca  showed that the gene expression patterns in the large colony group of mutants were very homogeneous while the expression patterns from the small colony group of mutants were relatively heterogeneous. these patterns reflect the variability of the colony size in the two groups. generally, large colony mutants are similar in size to wild-type colonies; the growth rate of these cells is also similar. the growth rate of cells in the small colony mutants is slower and more variable than wild-type cells. the standard deviation of the growth rate of cells from the small colony mutant samples was greater than that for cells from the large colony mutants.

expression of  <dig> genes was significantly altered between large and small colony mutants. when comparing the expression of large colony mutants to small colony mutants,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated. this bias might result from the characteristics of these genes. most of these genes are involved in regulation of growth. twenty-two of  <dig> genes mapped into ipa database were involved in the regulation of apoptosis. they are cdh <dig>  cdkn2a, chrm <dig>  cspg <dig>  ets <dig>  fgfr <dig>  gata <dig>  grn, ifi202b, il17rd, irf <dig>  lamb <dig>  neu <dig>  nppa, pdgfra, ptn, ptprc, rag <dig>  sema3b, stat <dig>  tgfbr <dig>  and tp53inp <dig>  expression of  <dig> genes among them was higher in small colony mutants than large colony mutants. this pattern of expression suggests that more apoptosis occurred in the small colony mutants, leading to the slow growth of the cells.

consistent with the growth rate phenotype is the finding that nearly all significant genes that can be found in ipa database were mapped into networks that were related to cell growth .

genes of particular interest in this group are recombination activating gene  <dig>  and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a . because a large portion of tk mutants may result from recombinational events, we have proposed that the mouse lymphoma cells have a high recombinase activity. the rag <dig> and rag <dig> genes are necessary for vj recombination  <cit> . also, rag <dig> is necessary for lymphocyte maturation and growth  <cit> . a  <dig> -fold lower activity of rag <dig> gene expression in small colony mutant  would restrict the cell growth of small colony mutants. because the large colony cells grow at a similar growth rate as the wild type mouse lymphoma cells, the high expression of rag <dig> in large colony cells might suggest that mouse lymphoma cells have an elevated level of the recombinase activity and these cells might be particularly sensitive to recombination and therefore particularly effective in detecting chemicals that induce recombination. cdkn2a is known to be an important tumor suppressor gene  <cit>  and generates several transcript variants that function as inhibitors of cdk <dig> kinase  <cit> . this protein also sequesters mdm <dig>  a protein involved in the degradation of p <dig>  and thus may serve to stabilize p <dig>  <cit> . therefore, this protein functions in cell cycle control and it is frequently mutated or deleted in a wide variety of tumors  <cit> . a  <dig> -fold higher expression activity of this tumor suppressor gene in small colony mutants  would favor a slower growth of those cells than the large colony cells.

of particular interest, the significant genes were disproportionally distributed in the vicinity of the tk gene on chromosome  <dig> with a higher expression level in small mutant colony mutants than in large colony mutants. ten of the significant genes were located on chromosome  <dig>  however, if the genes were distributed on the chromosomes proportionally, there would have been about  <dig> genes with up-regulation of expression in the small colony mutants on chromosome  <dig>  moreover,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were located within  <dig> cm of the tk gene . this gene distribution pattern may be explained by chromosomal location rather than by gene function, suggesting a regional change in gene expression. further, this suggests that the type of dna alteration that inactivates the tk gene in the small colony mutants is responsible for this regional change in gene activity. although the microsatellite loh pattern in the d and e bands of chromosome  <dig>  was the same for all the mutants, the gene expression in this region appeared significantly different between the large and small colony mutants.

CONCLUSIONS
the pca and hca showed that the gene expression profiles from the mutant samples were clearly separated into two groups based on their colony sizes. this cluster pattern indicates biological similarity within each mutant group and biological difference between the two different colony size mutants. statistical and functional analysis of the profiles identified a set of genes whose expression was differentially altered between large and small colony mutants. most of these genes are responsible for regulation of cell growth that would be expected to influence the cell growth rate and the colony sizes. in addition, we found a number of significant genes that were disproportionally concentrated on an area of chromosome  <dig> where there was loss of heterozygosity. these findings suggest that the tk chromosome mutations in the small tk colony mutants result in alterations in gene expression for genes located near the tk gene. this same altered gene expression does not occur in the large colony mutants. this finding is particularly interesting because the microsatellite loh analysis indicates no difference between the small and large colony mutants. our analysis demonstrates that the utility of microarray analysis using arraytrack provides a gene level analysis of the two cellular phenotypes. using this tool, we have identified genes that appear to be related to the colony size phenotype. the analysis of additional mutants would be expected to provide further information and may elucidate the underlying difference between the small and large colony tk mutants.
