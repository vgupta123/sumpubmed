BACKGROUND
evidence from phylogeographic studies suggests that southern europe, including the peninsulas of iberia, italy and the balkans and areas near the caucasus and the caspian sea, have functioned as refugial areas for species survival during periods of adverse climatic conditions  <cit> . recent studies also emphasize the important role that these refugial areas had in shaping the evolutionary history of species that have persisted within these regions for several ice ages. as suggested by early studies  <cit>  the topographic complexity and geographic mosaic of habitats in southern refugial peninsulas have favoured the occurrence of multiple disjunct refugia, allowing the persistence of isolated populations within them during glacial periods. within the iberian peninsula, complex species histories have been revealed for a variety of taxa, with some showing remarkable patterns of phylogeographic concordance  involving deep genetic subdivisions, high haplotype richness and distinct hybrid zones. not only has the iberian peninsula sourced the northern redistribution of species after ice ages, but it has also facilitated diversification through patterns of repeated population fragmentation, contraction, expansion and admixture. phylogeographic analyses for the golden-striped salamander, chioglossa lusitanica  <cit>  and schreiber's lizard, lacerta schreiberi  <cit>  provide good examples of the complexity that most likely typifies many species within this major peninsular glacial refugium.

however, even though the iberian peninsula is the best studied glacial refugium, most phylogeographic studies have focused on species that either have a narrow distribution within the region  or involve species groups that, although distributed across the entire region, generally have a genetic structure that relates to older cladogenetic events . in order to better understand the complex phylogeographic history of iberian species, and the way they have responded to pleistocene climatic oscillations, it is important to study species with distributions encompassing the entire iberian peninsula. for this purpose we have used the ocellated lizard, lacerta lepida , as a model to study the impact of pleistocene climatic changes in generating and structuring intraspecific genetic diversity on this regional scale. lacerta lepida is typically mediterranean, with a distribution encompassing all the iberian peninsula, and with phylogeographic structure across the region  <cit> . several mitochondrial lineages that appear to have non-overlapping geographic ranges were recently described, suggesting a history of allopatric differentiation in multiple refugia during the plio-pleistocene  <cit> . here we assess the broader phylogeographic patterns within lacerta lepida with the specific aims to i) clarify the distribution of mtdna phylogroups; ii) identify refugial areas within these phylogroups during the glacial periods; iii) date the main demographic and evolutionary events within lacerta lepida; and finally iv) identify secondary contact zones between the different phylogroups.

it is generally accepted that phylogeographic histories recovered using only mtdna as a marker are constrained to reveal one genealogy that reflects the maternally inherited natural history of an organism. relationships among phylogroups inferred through mtdna might be discordant with inferences made based on nuclear genes  and discordances have been illustrated in several studies . particularly within the iberian peninsula, several studies have emphasized the importance of using different types of markers to fully recover the complex evolutionary and demographic scenarios that most likely characterize the species that have persisted there across the quaternary. for example, in lacerta schreiberi evidence for gene flow and ancestral introgression between apparently allopatric mtdna lineages was only detected by the use of nuclear markers  <cit> . here we use both mtdna and ndna derived genealogies, since their contrasting molecular and population properties  are mutually informative when there have been opportunities for secondary contact, gene flow and hybridization between diverging populations.

methods
sampling
lizards were captured under licence during the years  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  sampling most of the distribution of lacerta lepida in portugal, spain, and france. sampling intensity was concentrated in regions known to contain high genetic divergence within western and south-eastern part of iberia  <cit> . lizards were captured using tomahawk traps or by hand, and tissue samples were taken by clipping  <dig> cm of the tail tip that was subsequently preserved in 100% ethanol. after tissue sampling, animals were immediately released back into the wild in the place of capture. geographic coordinates of sampling sites were recorded with a gps.

dna extraction, amplification and sequencing
total genomic dna was extracted from ethanol-preserved muscle tissue using a salt extraction protocol  <cit> . a fragment of  <dig> base pairs  of the mitochondrial dna  cytochrome b  gene was amplified using the truncated version of primer l <dig>  <cit>   and the modified version of primer mv <dig>  <cit>   to increase specificity for lacerta lepida, using information from published sequences in genbank. polymerase chain reactions  were performed in a total volume of  <dig> μl, containing  <dig>  u of taq polymerase ,  <dig> mm of mgcl <dig>   <dig>  mm of each nucleotide ,  <dig>  μm of each primer,  <dig> μl of  <dig> × nh <dig> reaction buffer  and approximately  <dig> ng of dna. pcr amplifications were conducted as follows: dna was initially denaturated at 94°c for  <dig> min followed by  <dig> cycles of denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> s, annealing at 51°c for  <dig> s and extension at 72°c for  <dig> s, plus a final extension step at 72°c for  <dig> min. negative controls  were included for all amplifications. pcr products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel and purified by filtration through qiaquick® columns  following the manufacturer's recommendations. purified pcr products were sequenced in both directions using the above primers, taq polymerase bigdye terminator v <dig> ™  and 30- <dig> ng of pcr product.

intron  <dig> of the β-fibrinogen gene  has been successfully used as a nuclear marker in several vertebrate phylogeographic and phylogenetic studies . specifically it was recently employed for a phylogenetic study of the genus lacerta  <cit>  where it revealed sufficient variation within lacerta lepida to be useful for phylogeographical inference. initial β-fibint <dig> amplifications were performed using primers fib-b17u  and fib-b17l   <cit>  and the conditions described in paulo et al.  <cit> . however, due to low amplification and sequencing success a nested pcr approach as suggested by sequeira et al.  <cit>  was subsequently adopted. a fragment of 788bp was first amplified from genomic dna using primers fib-b17u and fib-b17l . the product of this reaction  was then used as a template for a subsequent pcr of 691bp  using primer bfxf  <cit>  and bfx <dig>  <cit> . both amplifications were performed in a total volume of  <dig> μl, and included reagents in the same concentrations as those specified for cytb gene fragment. pcr cycle conditions were the same as described for cytb fragment but the primer annealing temperatures were 55°c and 56°c, for pcra and pcrb respectively. negative controls  were included for all amplifications. purified pcrb products were then sequenced with primers bfbx and bfx <dig> using identical sequencing conditions as for the mtdna cytb sequencing. all pcrs and sequencing reactions were performed in a mj research thermocycler  and sequences were obtained using an abi  <dig> capillary sequencer.

sequence analysis
dna sequences were aligned by eye using bioedit sequence alignment editor  <dig>   <cit> . β-fibint <dig> alleles of heterozygous individuals were inferred using phase version  <dig>   <cit> . ten replicate phase runs were conducted using  <dig> burnin steps and  <dig> iterations. the phase probability threshold was first set to  <dig> , but not all genotypes were resolved at this threshold. garrick et al.  <cit> , suggest that lowering the phase threshold to  <dig>  reduces the number of unresolved haplotypes with little or no increase in the number of false positives. in contrast, omitting unresolved haplotypes may have a substantial impact on downstream analyses, such as the estimation of tajima's d and fu's fs statistics, as unresolved haplotypes usually represent rare alleles  <cit> . we therefore reduced the phase threshold to  <dig>  to maximise recovery of haplotypes. several tests implemented in the software rdp <dig>  were used to detect evidence for recombination in β-fibint7: rdp  <cit> , geneconv  <cit> , maximum chi square  <cit> , chimaera  <cit>  and sister scanning  <cit> . due to the small size of the fragment used in the analyses , the window size for the recombination detection methods was set to 20bp.

phylogenetic analysis and haplotype network construction
phylogenetic relationships among cytb haplotypes were inferred using bayesian inference as implemented in mrbayes v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . data was divided into two partitions:  and  codon positions. the most appropriate substitution model for each partition was selected using modeltest v <dig>   <cit>  and the akaike information criterion   <cit> . the model selected for both partitions was the same  but with a different proportion of invariable sites  =  <dig>  and pinv =  <dig> ). the different partitions were allowed to evolve at different rates, with unlinked topology and unlinked parameters for the nucleotide substitution models. four markov chains were run for  <dig> million generations. to avoid local optima we used two independent runs, and to improve swapping of states between heated and cold chains the heating parameter was decreased to  <dig> . trees were sampled every  <dig> generations and the first  <dig> trees were discarded as burn-in. posterior probabilities were obtained from the 50% majority-rule consensus tree of the retained trees.

intraspecific gene genealogies were inferred using the median-joining   <cit>  and the statistical parsimony   <cit>  network construction approaches. the mj network was computed with the program network  <dig> . <dig>  and the sp network was inferred using the program tcs  <dig>   <cit> . for the mj approach the parameter ε was set to  <dig>  preventing less parsimonious pathways from being included in the analysis. the sp network was inferred with a parsimony confidence limit of 95%, allowing the inclusion of less parsimonious alternatives that fall within this confidence limit. ambiguities within networks were resolved where possible following the criteria of crandall & templeton  <cit> . the phylogenetic and β-fibint <dig> network analyses were rooted using gene sequences of the african sister species lacerta pater   <cit>  .

estimation of divergence times
divergence times within and between phylogroups were estimated using beast version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and the cytb dataset. beast performs bayesian statistical inferences of parameters, such as divergence times, by using markov chain monte carlo  as a framework. input files were generated with beauti version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the nucleotide substitution model and its parameter values were selected according to the results of modeltest version  <dig>   <cit> , with upper and lower bounds around the values defined as 120% and 80% respectively  <cit> . according to the bayesian information criterion  and the hierarchical likelihood ratio tests , the model of nucleotide substitution identified as the best fit to the data is the hky model  <cit>  with a gamma distribution  for substitution rates across sites  and no category of invariable sites. an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock was used with mean mutation rate of  <dig>  mutations/site/million years and standard deviation of  <dig> , assuming a normal distribution, as prior information. the mutation rate used was based on the provisional calibration of a reptile-specific molecular clock presented in paulo et al.  <cit>  who used published cytochrome b data sets from two studies of canary island reptiles   <cit>  calibrated with the geological age of el hierro. the standard deviation included in our study encompasses a faster mutation rate of  <dig>  and a slower mutation rate of  <dig>  mutations/site/million years. this takes into account potential underestimation of the mutation rate due to violation of the assumption of immediate island colonization in the clock calibration of paulo et al.  <cit> , or overestimation due to the longer generation time and larger body size of lacerta spp. when compared to gallotia spp.  <cit> . two runs were executed for  <dig> generations, sampling every  <dig> generations and discarding the first 10% as burn in. results of the two runs were displayed and combined in tracer v <dig>   <cit>  to check for stationarity and ensure that esss were above  <dig>  for all analyses one sequence of lacerta pater  was included as an outgroup.

in a second approach to estimate divergence times within phylogroups the method of saillard et al.  <cit>  was employed where each extant haplotype descending from the most recent common ancestor  represents a time interval between the present and the mrca. average distances from the mrca within each phylogroup are calculated from the number of mutational steps separating each haplotype from the mrca. the absolute timing of divergence is then calculated by multiplying the observed values by the average mutational changes per lineage per million years . three mutation rates were used:  <dig>  mutations/site/million years, representing the average mutation rate; a faster mutation rate of  <dig> , and a slower mutation rate of  <dig> .

neutrality tests and demographic analyses
in order to detect departures from a constant population size under the neutral model, tajima's d  <cit> , ramos-onsins & rozas' r <dig>  <cit>  and fu's fs  <cit>  tests were applied to both mtdna and ndna datasets. both r <dig> and fs statistics have been shown to be the best statistical tests to detect population growth   <cit> . population expansions have also been shown to leave particular signatures in the distribution of pairwise sequence differences  <cit> . we capitalized upon this by employing statistics based on the mismatch distribution to test for demographic expansions. the observed distribution of pairwise differences between haplotypes within phylogroups was compared with the expected results under a sudden-demographic and a spatial-demographic expansion model. statistically significant differences between observed and simulated expected distributions were evaluated with the sum of the square deviations  and harpending's raggedness index   <cit> . for the β-fibint <dig> gene we used two datasets: the first including only haplotypes inferred by phase with probability higher than  <dig> , and the second including all haplotypes inferred with the less stringent phase probability threshold of  <dig> . tests were performed with arlequin version  <dig>   <cit>  for tajima's d, fu's fs, sdd and hg, and with dnasp version  <dig>   <cit>  for r <dig> and expected values for the mismatch distribution. the demographic history of each phylogroup was also inferred using a coalescent-based approach. the model used to infer past population dynamics was the bayesian skyline plot  as implemented in beast version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . for each phylogroup we carried out two independent runs of  <dig> million generations each. trees and parameters were sampled every  <dig> iterations, with a burn in of 10%. results of each run were visualized using tracer v <dig>   <cit>  to ensure stationarity and convergence had been reached, and that effective sample sizes  were higher than  <dig> 

geographical distribution of alleles and inference of refugial areas
using predictions from coalescent theory  ancestral and derived haplotypes within each phylogroup were identified, thus obtaining a temporal framework for inferring haplotype origin within phylogroups. the null hypothesis of random geographic distribution of haplotypes was tested statistically using geodis version  <dig>   <cit>  with significance testing by permuting the data  <dig> times. when non-random associations of haplotypes with geography were detected, the geographic distribution of ancestral versus derived haplotypes  was further explored to identify possible refugial areas and the directionality of previously detected demographic and spatial expansions. coalescent theory predicts refugial areas to exhibit a high frequency of ancestral haplotypes  <cit> , and therefore the average number of mutations of a haplotype from the mrca is expected to be significantly lower in refugial areas than would be expected by chance. in contrast, recently colonized areas are predicted to show a high incidence of derived haplotypes  <cit> , and therefore the average number of mutations of a haplotype from the mrca is expected to be significantly higher than would be expected by chance. to test the hypothesis that refugial areas are located in the south of a phylogroup's distribution, with the north having been more recently colonized, we estimated the average distances of alleles from the mrca within both the north and south of the geographic range of a phylogroup. we then tested whether these values were significantly high or low by randomizing the geographic states of alleles to generate a null distribution of mean haplotype distance from the mrca within both the south and north of a phylogroup's distribution.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> lizards were sampled from  <dig> different sites across the distribution of lacerta lepida. sampling sites and number of samples per site are shown in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  respectively. a total of  <dig> cytb and  <dig> β-fibint <dig> sequences were obtained.

sequence variability
all cytb sequences represented uninterrupted open reading frames, with no gaps or premature stop codons, suggesting they are functional mitochondrial dna copies. the chromatograms of  <dig> sequences were polymorphic at several nucleotide positions. these samples were from individuals collected at sampling sites  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . as it was not possible to correctly identify the corresponding mitochondrial sequence of each sample these sequences were eliminated from further analysis. one hundred and forty five  unique haplotypes were obtained from the  <dig> sequences analysed. of a total of  <dig> sites sequenced,  <dig> were variable, from which  <dig> were parsimony informative. pairwise genetic distances  between haplotypes ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . β-fibint <dig> sequences were trimmed to  <dig> bp in order to eliminate gaps within the sequences. from the  <dig> bp,  <dig> sites were variable of which  <dig> were parsimony informative. the haplotypes inferred by phase for heterozygous individuals were consistent across runs. twenty unique haplotypes  were identified among the  <dig> alleles analysed and recombination was not detected by any of the tests applied. when using a phase probability threshold of  <dig> ,  <dig> genotypes were unresolved , and this included the loss of only a single haplotype  that was additionally recovered with a probability threshold of  <dig> .

values in diagonal represent average pairwise genetic distances within phylogroups. values above diagonal and in diagonal inside brackets represent uncorrected genetic distances  and values under diagonal and in diagonal outside brackets represent genetic distances corrected using the hky + Γ model for nucleotide substitution.

phylogenetic and network relationships among haplotypes
the results of the phylogenetic and network analyses both support the existence of two main phylogroups: phylogroup n and phylogroup l . the geographic distribution of phylogroup n is coincident with the betic mountains in south-eastern spain and is associated with the subspecies lacerta lepida nevadensis , while phylogroup l occupies the remaining area of the species distribution. within phylogroup l there are four geographically structured monophyletic groups , albeit with only moderate bayesian support for the monophyly of l <dig> . the genealogical relationships among cytb haplotypes inferred by the two approaches for network construction  are highly congruent. at the 95% confidence limit tcs produced three unconnected networks . when the confidence limit was reduced  the three sp networks were connected in one single network , with relationships identical to those from the mj analysis, with  <dig> loops, of which  <dig> were easily resolved by applying the criteria of crandall and templeton  <cit> .

within phylogroup l, five geographically distinct groups of haplotypes can be identified , which include the four mitochondrial phylogroups  identified by paulo et al.  <cit>  and a new lineage of haplotypes  possessing a geographically distinct distribution from other haplotypes within phylogroup l <dig>  average genetic distances  between these phylogroups range from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % . phylogroup l <dig> is distributed mainly across the central mountain system between the douro and tagus river basins in spain. phylogroup l <dig> is distributed in southern portugal, occupying the regions of algarve and baixo alentejo. this phylogroup is clustered together in the network with phylogroup l <dig>  forming a monophyletic group in the phylogeny . l <dig> is distributed several hundred kilometres  to the north of l <dig> occupying the north-western corner of iberia, mainly the regions to the north of the douro river in portugal and the regions of asturias and galicia in spain. the geographic region between phylogroups l <dig> and l <dig> is occupied by two other phylogroups, l <dig> and l <dig>  phylogroup l <dig> is restricted to central portugal, occupying the region between the tagus and douro rivers. l <dig> has the broadest distribution, occupying the remaining areas of southern portugal and spain passing through the ebro valley to reach the atlantic and mediterranean coasts of france.

the root of the network is located along the branch that connects the very divergent lineages l and n, allowing for the inference of the most recent common ancestor  for each phylogroup . although this identification is straightforward for clade n , the networks reveal two probable ancestral haplotypes within clade l , which are connected to haplotype  <dig> through a loop. sp and mj networks constructed with 0-fold degenerate sites only, thus reducing homoplasy within the data set  result in the collapse of this reticulation, and haplotype  <dig>  connects unambiguously to haplotype  <dig> , supporting  <dig> as the ancestral haplotype within phylogroup l. divergent mitochondrial haplotypes from different phylogroups occurring in sympatry were detected in several populations. the admixed populations were: populations  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ; populations  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  <dig> and  <dig> ; population  <dig> ; population  <dig>  and population  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  .

the relationships among β-fibint <dig> haplotypes inferred by the two network construction approaches  were identical, resulting in a single network with  <dig> unresolved reticulations . haplotype b <dig> is inferred to be the ancestral haplotype as it connects unambiguously to the outgroup. haplotype b <dig> is restricted to the south-west of the species distribution . haplotype b <dig> is the most common haplotype and has the widest distribution within the group, occurring in 83% of samples. this haplotype is connected to several low frequency haplotypes, generating a star-like genealogy, suggestive of a possible past range expansion and for which signatures of expansion were formally detected by mismatch distribution analysis and neutrality tests . within the  <dig> southernmost samples,  <dig> alleles are found, representing 80% of the nuclear allele diversity. from those  <dig> alleles,  <dig> are restricted to the southern area.

the nuclear data failed to recover the phylogroups detected by the mtdna dataset. nevertheless, when the nuclear dataset is grouped according to the mtdna phylogroups previously identified, structure in the distribution of alleles can be detected. for this analysis each of the mtdna phylogroups was considered as a geographic region and geodis was used to test for geographical structure amongst the nuclear genetic variation. nuclear haplotypes are shared among some of the mtdna phylogroups : all haplotypes from l <dig>  occur either in l <dig>  or in l <dig> ; all haplotypes from l <dig>  occur in l <dig> ; all haplotypes from l <dig>  occur either in l <dig> , either in l <dig>  or in l <dig>  and finally haplotypes from l <dig>  occur either in l <dig>  or in l <dig> . additionally all phylogroups share haplotype b <dig>  and all phylogroups apart from l <dig> and l <dig> also share haplotype b <dig> . it is important to note that only geographically close phylogroups share nuclear haplotypes. it is also possible to identify private haplotypes within the geography of several mtdna phylogroups: b <dig> was only detected in phylogroup l1; haplotypes b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> in l <dig> and haplotypes b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> in phylogroup n.

divergence times
mean ages and 95% highest posterior density  of mtdna phylogroups are shown in table  <dig>  divergence within the group is estimated to have started approximately  <dig>  million years ago   in the mid-late miocene, corresponding to the cladogenetic event between phylogroups n and l. although divergence within phylogroup l is estimated to have started in the plio-pleistocene  the current diversity within each phylogroup seems to have pleistocene origins, with diversification times for all phylogroups estimated to be younger than  <dig>  ma. the oldest split within group l relates to the divergence of the monophyletic lineage composed of phylogroups l <dig> and l <dig> from the remaining phylogroups.

for each node the mean divergence time and the lower and upper values of the highest probability distribution  are presented. .

 divergence times were calculated using mutations rates drawn from a normal distribution with a mean mutation rate of  <dig>  mutations/site/million years and a standard deviation of  <dig> .

n.a: not applicable

neutrality tests and demographic analyses
significant deviations from neutrality that could reflect past population expansion events were detected for almost all phylogroups with tajima's d, with the exception of phylogroup l <dig>  when more powerful statistics were applied, a similar pattern of significant deviations from neutrality were observed, with the exception of phylogroups l <dig> and l <dig> . the distributions of pairwise differences within each phylogroup were also found to be consistent with sudden-expansion and spatial-expansion models , with signatures of population growth being exhibited by the bell shaped mismatch distributions . historical demographic reconstructions  also show a trend of population growth in all phylogroups .

geographical distribution of alleles and inference of refugial areas
within phylogroups, statistically significant associations between genetic variation and geographic distribution were detected for l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig> and n . more detailed geographic sampling within phylogroups l <dig> and l <dig> allowed for the testing of hypotheses of southern refugial origin and northern expansion. the average number of mutations of haplotypes from the mrca in southern regions of phylogroups l <dig> and l <dig> was significantly lower than that expected by chance  . in contrast, northern haplotypes exhibit a significantly higher average number of mutations from the mrca than expected by chance  . these results reveal significant associations of ancestral haplotypes with southern ranges and derived haplotypes with northern regions for these two phylogroups.

discussion
detailed analysis of the distribution of mitochondrial genetic variation within lacerta lepida across the iberian peninsula revealed a complex phylogeographic history for the species. the cytb genealogy clearly defines  <dig> geographic phylogroups with generally non-overlapping geographic distributions. the strong association of mtdna genetic variation with geography suggests a history of allopatric divergence in different refugia within the iberian peninsula, a pattern that has been described for several taxa within the region . although this pattern of differentiation of distinct evolutionary units in allopatry was less evident from the analysis of the nuclear data, the distribution of nuclear haplotypes is not in conflict with the mtdna phylogroups. failure of the nuclear gene genealogy to reveal concordant genetic structure with the mitochondrial genealogy can be expected if one takes into account the fact that nuclear genes take on average four times longer to reach monophyly than mitochondrial ones  <cit> . in fact, most of the intraspecific differentiation within lacerta lepida is of relatively recent origin, with the majority of phylogroups  estimated to have diversified within the pleistocene, increasing the probability of mitochondrial lineages not being reciprocally monophyletic for nuclear markers. nevertheless, phylogroup n is estimated to have diverged from the remaining phylogroups during the miocene  representing a much older cladogenetic event within the group. this older split therefore allows for more time for lineage sorting at the nuclear level. this is evident in the composition of nuclear haplotypes of phylogroup n, which are almost all private with the exception of the ancestral haplotypes . thus, although mtdna lineages have not reached monophyly at the nuclear level, some level of nuclear differentiation between mtdna lineages is detected by the existence of private alleles, and this is most pronounced for phylogroups that represent older cladogenetic events . incomplete lineage sorting seems therefore a plausible explanation for the discrepancies in mitochondrial and nuclear gene genealogies. recent phylogeographic and phylogenetic studies focusing on lizards in the iberian peninsula reveal similar discrepant patterns between mtdna and nuclear genealogies  <cit> . in the case of podarcis wall lizards pinho et al.  <cit>  showed that, despite a complete lack of monophyly at the nuclear level, most of the species show historical reproductive isolation and that the lack of monophyly is mainly a result of shared ancestral polymorphism.

although it is plausible that incomplete lineage sorting is responsible for the failure of nuclear genealogy to recover the mitochondrial phylogroups in lacerta lepida, current gene flow, mainly male-biased, at zones of secondary contact can also be invoked to explain the patterns observed. evidence for this comes from the observation that geographically close phylogroups share more derived haplotypes. for example allele b <dig> occurs only in the very divergent phylogroups l <dig> and l <dig> near the zone of contact, but it was not detected in the ancestral phylogroup l <dig>  suggesting that nuclear gene flow may be occurring between the l <dig> and l <dig> mtdna lineages. the same is true for allele b <dig> which, although more widespread within phylogroup l <dig>  is also found in individuals of l <dig> near the zone of contact, but was not detected in phylogroup l <dig>  which is phylogenetically closer to phylogroup l <dig> 

historical biogeography of lacerta lepida
divergence within lacerta lepida is estimated to have started in the miocene, approximately  <dig>  mya , with divergence of phylogroup n from phylogroup l. within phylogroup l estimated divergence times are much younger and inferred to have been initiated in the plio-pleistocene, approximately  <dig>  mya . interestingly, although divergences between the mitochondrial phylogroups have a plio-pleistocene  or a late miocene  origin, haplotype diversities within phylogroups indicate a strong influence of later pleistocene events, with diversification within phylogroups starting between  <dig>  and  <dig>  ma. the importance of the pleistocene climatic oscillations in promoting species differentiation in the iberian peninsula has been emphasized by previous studies  and this clearly also seems to be the case for lacerta lepida.

phylogroup n
phylogroup n is distributed across the betic mountain range in south-western spain and its distribution approximately coincides with the described subspecies lacerta lepida nevadensis. the existence of clear significant morphological differentiation between l. l. nevadensis and the remaining subspecies of lacerta lepida  <cit> , together with high levels of allozyme differentiation  <cit>  and mitochondrial genetic differentiation , suggests that the two lineages  might in fact reflect two different species. paulo et al.  <cit>  have inferred that divergence between phylogroups l and n were initiated by overseas dispersal between what was then the iberian mainland and the betic massif that at that time existed as an island between iberia and north africa. under this scenario subsequent contact between the phylogroups would have been initiated after the merging of the betic massif with iberian mainland, due to the closing of the betic corridor  <dig> - <dig>  ma . the betic mountain range is a region of high endemism for plants and animals, and its importance as a refugium for other taxa has been highlighted before . interestingly, some of these taxa show similar divergence times and distribution as phylogroup n .

phylogroups l <dig> and l3
the monophyletic group composed of phylogroups l <dig> and l <dig> is estimated to have started diverging from the remaining phylogroups in the early pleistocene, approximately  <dig>  mya . interestingly these two phylogroups have a disjunct distribution, with phylogroup l <dig> occupying the south of portugal whereas l <dig> occupies the north-western parts of the iberian peninsula. the intervening region between phylogroups l <dig> and l <dig> is occupied by phylogroup l <dig>  a vicariant event during the middle pleistocene  triggering divergence between the l2-l <dig> lineage and the remaining populations of lacerta lepida seems probable. it is noteworthy that most phylogeographic studies within iberia reveal similar phylogenetic breaks associated with the same period , suggesting a common vicariant history. such a vicariant event was most likely climatically-mediated as no apparent geographical barrier exists within western iberian peninsula.

the western algarve region in southern portugal has been indicated as the evolutionary centre for several species and also as a key refugial area  <cit> . the region harboured relicts of temperate forests during the last glacial maximum  <cit> , probably providing suitable conditions for species survival through glacial periods. the high genetic distance and disjunct distribution found between phylogroups l <dig> and l <dig> is most likely the consequence of fragmentation of a once more continuous range in response to a cooling climate. subsequent climate amelioration during an interglacial period probably resulted in this distribution gap being colonized by l <dig>  expanding from another nearby refugium. a similar distribution pattern of genetic variation is found within discoglossus galganoi across portugal, with two closely related phylogroups distributed in the south and north and a less related phylogroup bisecting their distribution  <cit> . the distribution of discoglossus galganoi phylogroups and the evolutionary relationship between them is remarkably similar to that found within lacerta lepida.

phylogroups l <dig>  l <dig> and l5
the refugia for lacerta lepida phylogroups l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> were probably located in the south-eastern side of the guadalquivir basin. support for this comes from the distribution of ancestral haplotypes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> within phylogroup l <dig> that are found only in this region . the two very divergent haplotypes within l <dig>  are also restricted to this region. the widespread distribution of the most frequently sampled haplotype  <dig> suggests that the spatial and demographic expansion detected within l <dig> was of a "leading edge" type  <cit> , with few individuals rapidly colonizing adjacent regions, leading to a decrease in genetic diversity on the newly colonized areas. the different phylogroups are most likely the result of three different expansions from the southern refugia dominated by different ancestral haplotypes, followed by further divergence in allopatry.

refugial areas, range expansions, and secondary contact
the lower mutation rate and slower fixation rate of nuclear genes, when compared to the mitochondrial genome, mean that nuclear genealogies may be more indicative of older demographic events  <cit> . therefore, the analysis of the distribution of ancestral nuclear alleles can be useful in the identification of refugial areas. haplotype b <dig> is the root of the nuclear gene network, representing the most ancestral allele in the dataset. the distribution of b <dig> is primarily in the southern region of iberia, where it occurs with higher frequency than in northern regions . furthermore the southern region of iberia  shows higher nuclear haplotype richness, with 90% of the identified haplotypes occurring in this region from which 67% do not occur further north. the high nuclear haplotype richness found in the southern regions of iberia, together with the high frequency of b <dig> in this region suggest that southern populations are older and the source of subsequent northern expansions.

the geographical and genealogical relationships of mitochondrial haplotypes within phylogroups provide further indications as to the probable refugial areas from where range expansions subsequently occurred. the same pattern of older  haplotypes being typically found within southern sampling sites is also evident for the mitochondrial dataset. for example within phylogroup l <dig>  the ancestral haplotype  <dig> and the related interior haplotype  <dig> are most frequent in southern sites  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  coincident with the algarve and southern alentejo region in portugal. within phylogroup l <dig> the ancestral haplotype  <dig> and the related interior haplotype  <dig> occur either in the southern region of the phylogroup distribution, to the south of douro river , or in sites located at the centre of the phylogroup distribution . within phylogroup l <dig>  the ancestral haplotype  <dig> and the closely related haplotypes  <dig> and  <dig> occur again only in the south-eastern limit of this phylogroup , near the source of the guadalquivir river in jaen, spain. finally the ancestral haplotype of phylogroup l <dig>  and the related interior haplotypes  <dig> and  <dig> are most frequent within southern sites of this phylogroup , along the river tagus basin. these patterns are statistically significant for phylogroups l <dig> and l <dig> , which also reveal an excess of derived haplotypes in the north of their geographic ranges. these repeated pattern of ancestral haplotypes occurring more frequently towards the southern range of phylogroups, and in some cases derived haplotypes being more frequent within more northern sites, suggests that southern regions within phylogroup ranges have probably functioned as refugia during past adverse climatic conditions, from which subsequent northern expansions occurred.

the evolutionary history of lacerta lepida is consistent with a history of population fragmentation and allopatric divergence in southern refugia, followed by recent demographic and spatial range expansions. demographic expansions are supported by the neutrality and mismatch distribution tests that reveal signatures of demographic and spatial expansions in almost all phylogroups and by the bsp analysis, which show a trend of population expansion in all phylogroups between  <dig>  to  <dig>  million years ago . spatial expansions are supported by the latitudinal variation observed for the distributions of ancestral and derived haplotypes. this history of diversification in allopatry followed by range expansions has lead to the establishment of at least four secondary contact zones where very divergent mitochondrial haplotypes belonging to different phylogroups were found in sympatry . further analyses of these zones may provide insights into the mechanisms involved in speciation and divergence within this lizard species.

CONCLUSIONS
mitochondrial and nuclear gene genealogies in lacerta lepida provide evidence for a history of isolation and divergence in allopatry resulting in the diversification of six genetically and geographically distinct lineages. although diversification within the group is largely concordant with the onset of the major glaciations at the beginning of the pleistocene , an earlier event associated with the miocene was also identified. this event , which marks the divergence of lineages n and l, seems to be associated with geological events related to the evolution of the mediterranean basin. signatures of recent demographic and spatial expansions were apparent in all phylogroups, with several phylogroups having established zones of secondary contact. analyses of the distribution of ancestral and derived alleles within each phylogroup, and inferences related to the biogeography of lacerta lepida, allowed the identification of probable refugia within the iberian peninsula, suggesting southern refugial areas within phylogroups. our work highlights the importance of these areas for the long-term conservation and management of diversity with lacerta lepida across its geographic range.
