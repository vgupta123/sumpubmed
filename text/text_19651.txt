BACKGROUND
watermelon  belongs to the cucurbitaceae family which includes several other important vegetable crops such as melon, cucumber, squash and pumpkin. it produces large edible fruits that serve as an important component in human diets throughout the world  <cit>  and its farming accounts for ~7% of the world's total area devoted to vegetable production according to fao statistics  <cit> . its production in the u.s. alone reached  <dig> billion pounds in  <dig> with a net market value of half billion u.s. dollars. the quality of watermelon fruits consists of many factors including fruit shape and size, rind thickness and color, flesh texture and color, aroma, flavor, sugar content, carotenoid and flavonoid composition, and nutrient composition  <cit> . during the development and ripening process, watermelon fruits undergo many biochemical and physiological changes including size expansion, fruit softening, and accumulation of sugars, pigments, and flavor and aromatic volatiles  <cit> . most of these traits are controlled by multiple qtls and pose a significant challenge to traditional breeding  <cit> .

currently genomics and functional genomics resources of watermelon that are publicly available are very limited. this lack of extensive genomics and functional genomics resources, combined with the narrow genetic diversity among watermelon cultivars, is one of the major limiting factors in watermelon research and breeding. however, this situation will soon be changed due to the recent advent of next-generation sequencing  technologies such as roche/ <dig> and illumina/solexa sequencing platforms. the extremely high throughput and relatively low cost of these sequencing technologies have offered unique opportunities to study genomics and functional genomics in non-model organisms. using the ngs technologies, currently the genome of watermelon, which has an estimated size of  <dig> mb  <cit> , is being sequenced by the international watermelon genomics initiative. the genome sequencing of cucumber, a closely-related cucurbit species, was completed  <cit> , and the genome of melon, another closely-related cucurbit species, is being sequenced under the spanish genomics initiative . complementary to whole genome sequencing, which still requires huge effort and investment, large-scale transcriptome sequencing has proved to be efficient and cost-effective for gene discovery and gene function and expression analysis. recently, several large expressed sequence tag  datasets have been generated in cucurbit species. these include approximately  <dig>  million,  <dig>  and  <dig>  ests generated from melon  <cit> , cucumber  <cit>  and cucurbita pepo  <cit> , respectively, using the roche/ <dig> sequencing technologies, and an additional ~ <dig>  ests generated from melon using the traditional sanger sequencing approach  <cit> . however, currently only around  <dig>  watermelon ests are available in genbank. thus it's very important to expand the transcript catalog of watermelon in order to facilitate gene discovery, functional analysis, molecular breeding, and comparative genomics analysis of watermelon and its closely-related species.

fruit is a major component of the human diet contributing a large portion of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber. fruit development and ripening is a complex process influenced by numerous factors including light, hormones, temperature and genotype. ripening associated events are brought about by developmentally and physiologically regulated changes in gene expression which ultimately lead to alterations in color, texture, flavor, and aroma of fruit. fruit can be physiologically classified as climacteric or non-climacteric depending on the presence or absence of a burst in respiration at the onset of ripening  <cit> . tomato, a climacteric fruit, has served as the model system for fruit development and ripening and attracted extensive studies to understand molecular mechanisms of the development and ripening of its fleshy fruits  <cit> . however, very little information is currently available at the molecular level regarding fruit development and ripening of watermelon, a non-climacteric and economically important fruit crop. to date, there is only one report describing expression profiles of a very small set of genes  during watermelon fruit development through microarray and qrt-pcr analysis  <cit> .

in order to significantly expand the transcript catalog of watermelon and gain more insights into the molecular basis of watermelon fruit development, we performed large-scale transcriptome sequencing of watermelon fruits using the roch/ <dig> massively parallel pyrosequencing technology. a total of  <dig>  ests were obtained and assembled into  <dig>  unigenes which were further extensively annotated. digital expression analysis of these ests identified more than  <dig>  unigenes that were differentially expressed during watermelon fruit development. this information, coupled with profiles of several interesting metabolites that are important to fruit quality, provided novel insights into the biology of watermelon fruit development and ripening process.

RESULTS
sequencing and assembly of watermelon fruit transcriptome
watermelon cultivar  <dig> was used in the present study. it is a typical east asian cultivar that produces round shape, medium size, thin rind, and green skin fruits with light red flesh. four critical stages of fruit development, immature white ), white-pink flesh , red flesh  and over-ripe , were examined . fruits at the immature white stage undergo rapid cell division and expansion leading to significant increase of fruit size and weight. at this stage, there is no distinguishable difference between the fruit inner peel and the flesh tissue in term of texture and color. its soluble solid content  is also considerably lower than that of the mature fruit . at the white-pink flesh stage, the fruit continue to expand without much increase in ssc, but the fruit flesh begins to turn pink and it starts to lose its firmness . after reaching the red flesh stage, the fruit is fully mature and its flesh becomes light red, much crispier and sweeter. the changes of texture and taste are also associated with a rapid increase of ssc . at the over-ripe stage, the fruit is now over-matured and the flesh turns bright red with accumulation of volatile compounds that gives watermelon its distinct aroma and flavor .

to characterize watermelon transcriptome and generate expression profiles for fruit development, we used the roche/ <dig> gs-flx  pyrosequencing technology to sequence cdna samples from the four aforementioned fruit developmental stages. a half run was performed for each of the four fruit samples and approximately  <dig>  raw reads were obtained. after trimming low quality regions and removing short  and contaminated reads, we obtained a total of  <dig>  high quality ests with an average length of  <dig>  bp and total length of  <dig>  mb . the length distribution of these high quality roche/ <dig> ests in each sample is shown in figure  <dig>  over 75% of these ests fell between  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length.

the roche/ <dig> ests generated in the present study, together with  <dig>  watermelon sanger ests collected from genbank dbest database, were de novo assembled into  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig> bp. the unigenes included  <dig>  contigs with an average length of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  singletons with an average length of  <dig>  bp. the assembled transcriptome is approximately  <dig>  mb in size. table  <dig> lists the distribution of the number of est members in watermelon unigenes. around 10% of the unigenes  have more than  <dig> est members and they contain ~71% of the total est reads. the est and unigene sequences generated in this study are freely available at the cucurbit genomics database  <cit> .

our assembly included approximately  <dig>  ests generated from a fruit normalized and subtracted library reported in levi et al.  <cit> . in the assembly, these ests were distributed in  <dig>  unigenes, among which  <dig>  were not captured by our  <dig> deep transcriptome sequencing. this indicated that although the  <dig> deep sequencing generated a large number of novel unigenes , sequencing the transcriptome to higher depth is required to discover more rare genes.

functional annotation, comparative genomics and pathway analysis
to annotate the watermelon transcriptome, we first compared unigene sequences against the ncbi non-redundant  protein database using the blastx program. the analysis revealed that  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   unigenes had matches to known protein sequences with e-values < 1e- <dig>  1e- <dig>  and 1e- <dig>  respectively . as expected, much higher proportion of contigs had sequence matches than singletons  due to the much shorter average length of singletons which are less likely to contain coding regions. we also compared watermelon unigenes against uniprot  protein databases. details of these sequence comparisons are provided at the cucurbit genomics database  <cit> .

note: percentages of contigs, singletons and total unigenes were calculated from total numbers of contigs , singletons  and unigenes , respectively.

we then compared watermelon unigenes against protein database of cucumber, the closely related cucurbit species with a sequenced genome, and arabidopsis and rice, model systems for dicot and monocot plants, respectively. at an e-value < 1e- <dig>  approximately 66% of watermelon unigenes had matches in cucumber protein database, while 55% and 52% of watermelon unigenes in arabidopsis and rice protein databases, respectively . of watermelon unigenes that had matches in at least one of the three databases, the majority  had sequence matches in all three protein databases . as shown in figure  <dig>  a significant number of watermelon unigenes  that did not have matches against nr did have matches against cucumber proteins. this is not unexpected since currently cucumber proteins have yet to be archived in the nr database, and watermelon and cucumber are closely-related cucurbitaceae species.

we further compared watermelon unigenes against pfam domain database  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  watermelon unigenes contained at least one pfam domain and  <dig>  distinct pfam domains were represented by the unigenes. the most abundant pfam domains found in the collection of watermelon unigenes were pf <dig> , pf <dig> , pf <dig> , pf <dig> , and pf <dig> . we also found that  <dig> unigenes contained transcription factor domains. the most represented pfam transcription factor domains were pf <dig> , pf <dig> , pf <dig> , pf <dig> , and pf <dig> .

gene ontology  terms were then assigned to watermelon unigenes based on their sequence matches to known proteins in the uniprot databases and pfam domains they contain. a total of  <dig>  unigenes  were assigned with at least one go term, among which  <dig>   were assigned with at least one go term in the biological process category,  <dig>   in the molecular function category, and  <dig>   in the cellular component category, while  <dig>   unigenes were assigned go terms in all three categories. based on the go annotations, watermelon unigenes were classified into different functional categories using a set of plant-specific go slims, which are a list of high-level go terms providing a broad overview of the ontology content. cellular process, binding and membrane are the most abundant go slims within the biological process, molecular function, and cellular component categories, respectively . cellular process, metabolic process, and biosynthetic process were among the most highly represented groups within the biological process category, indicating the fruit flesh tissue was undergoing extensive metabolic activities. it is worth noting that go annotations revealed a large number of expressed genes involved in carbohydrate metabolic process , anatomical structure morphogenesis , cellular amino acid and derivative metabolic process , and secondary metabolic process . in addition, genes involved in other important biological processes such as stress response, signal transduction, cell differentiation and fruit ripening were also identified.

to further identify active biochemical pathways during watermelon fruit development and ripening, we predicted biochemical pathways from our est collection using the pathway tools  <cit> . a watermelon metabolic pathway database has been constructed and is freely available at the cucurbit genomics database  <cit> . the database contained  <dig> metabolite pathways which were predicted from  <dig>  enzyme-coding unigenes. most major plant biochemical pathways such as calvin cycle, cellulose biosynthesis, ethylene biosynthesis, glycolysis ii and iv, gluconeogenesis, and sucrose degradation, and several important secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways including the citrulline-nitric oxide cycle, trans-lycopene biosynthesis, beta-carotene biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis, were well covered by our est collection.

watermelon simple sequence repeats 
during the past several years, ssr markers have been extensively used in cucurbit species such as cucumber and melon for construction of high-density genetic maps and identification of qtls associated with economically important traits  <cit> . however, due to the limited resources of watermelon sequences, ssr markers in watermelon have been scarce. we screened watermelon unigenes for the presence of di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide ssr motifs and were able to predict  <dig>  ssrs from  <dig>  watermelon unigenes, among which  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide ssr motifs, respectively. the most frequent ssr motif was ag/ct , followed by aag/ctt , at/at , and aat/att . primer pairs were designed for ssr motifs that had sufficient flanking sequences. the complete list of ssr motifs and their corresponding primer pair information are provided in additional file  <dig> 

the ssrs identified in the present study provide a rich resource of valuable molecular markers in watermelon. however, polymorphism of these ssrs will of course need to be tested in specific resource populations.

dynamic changes of gene expression and metabolite profiles during fruit development
fruit development and ripening is a genetically programmed event that is defined by a series of biochemical and physiological changes that ultimately alter the fruit color, aroma, texture and its nutritional values. researches toward elucidating the molecular basis of fruit development and ripening have been mainly performed on tomato, a typical climacteric fruit and model organism for fruit ripening, and numerous ripening-related genes have been isolated in tomato  <cit> . however, current available information regarding the physiology, biochemistry and molecular biology of fruit development and ripening of watermelon, a non-climacteric fruit, is very limited. to gain more insights into molecular mechanisms of watermelon fruit development and ripening, we performed comprehensive digital expression analysis using ests generated from the four stages described above.

digital expression profiling  is a powerful and efficient approach for large-scale gene expression analysis  <cit> . previous reports have described the identification of important genes through digital expression analysis with collections of relatively small number  of tags  <cit> . in the present study, we have generated at least  <dig>  tags for each of the four samples , thus we should be able to capture the majority of moderately and highly expressed genes that are of interest. to validate the data from our digital expression analysis, qrt-pcr assays were performed on two sugar metabolism genes. the results showed that although the exact fold changes of selected genes at several data points varied between digital expression and qrt-pct analyses, trends of gene expression changes detected by the two different approaches were largely consistent . this confirmed the robustness of our digital expression data. in addition, previous reports indicated the increased expression of phytoene synthase  <dig>  <cit>  and decreased expression of lycopene beta cyclase  <cit>  during watermelon fruit development, which is consistent with our digital expression data . this further validated our digital expression results.

note: digital expression data is shown as reads per million and qrt-pcr results were shown as relative fold changes compared to  <dig> dap

our digital expression analysis identified a total of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes with at least two-fold difference in expression levels during watermelon fruit development and a false discovery rate  <  <dig>  . from this list of differentially expressed genes, we identified significantly enriched go terms , which serve as indicators of significantly altered biological processes during watermelon fruit development . among them are a number of interesting biological processes that are known to be associated with fruit development, including go terms related to responses to different abiotic/biotic stresses, secondary metabolic process, organic acid metabolic process, and flavonoid biosynthetic/metabolic processes. we then further identified significantly altered biochemical pathways during watermelon fruit development; among which are several important pathways that are known to affect fruit quality, such as pathways of cellulose biosynthesis, suberin biosynthesis, sucrose biosynthesis and degradation, and starch biosynthesis and degradation .

we further classified differentially expressed genes into different categories according to their expression patterns: 1) genes that are highly expressed in each of the four stages; 2) genes that are highly expressed in early stages; 3) genes that are highly expressed in late stages . we also generated profiles of three major sugars  that determine the sweetness of fruit and three carotenoids  that play a critical role in fruit coloration and contribute significantly to fruit phyto-nutrient values. an integrative analysis of gene expression and metabolite profiles was performed to gain a better understanding of important fruit quality-related traits in watermelon.

cell wall-related genes are highly expressed in immature white fruits
immature watermelon fruits undergo a burst of cell division and later continue cell expansion to form large vacuolated cells that make up the majority of the flesh tissue  <cit> . cell expansion involves changes in cell wall structure and continuous accumulation  of carbohydrates, organic acids, and different compounds needed to retain the osmotic pressure and flow of water into the expanding cells  <cit> . through digital expression analysis, we identified a number of cell wall related genes that were expressed significantly higher in immature white fruits, including prps , fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins , xyloglucan endotransglycosylases  . prps are a group of cell wall proteins characterized by their proline and hydroproline-rich repetitive peptides. they have been reported to be involved in cell wall formation and cell expansion in arabidopsis, carrot and cotton  <cit> . flas are a subclass of arabinogalactan proteins  that contain putative cell adhesion domains known as fasciclin domains. in eukaryotes, fasciclin domain-containing proteins are involved in cell adhesion and cell expansion  <cit> . during cell expansion and elongation, the cell wall continually undergoes temporary loosening followed by rapid reinforcement of wall structure. xets are unique enzymes in plants that are capable of modulating the chemistry of the matrix and therefore performing both of these functions  <cit> . xets have proved to catalyze the formation of covalent linkages between xyloglucans and cellulosic substrates and between xyloglucans and -β-d-glucans, and influence cell wall strength, flexibility and porosity, and cell expansion  <cit> .

several other genes involved in cell division and expansion were also identified as highly expressed genes in immature white fruits, including early nodulin-like proteins , s-adenosyl methionine decarboxylase  and auxin-repressed protein arp <dig>  enods have been reported to function in cell-to-cell signaling, cell differentiation, tissue development, and signal transduction pathways  <cit> . samdc is the key gene involved in the biosynthesis pathway of polyamines , which are related to the cell growth and division in the early fruit development of many plant species  <cit> . auxin is a plant growth hormone with many roles in cell division and enlargement, differentiation, and vascular bundle formation  <cit> . the expression of auxin responsive genes was also up-regulated in the rapid expansion phase of tomato fruit and in the fast fiber cell elongation stage of cotton  <cit> . these genes might play important roles in contributing to the fast growth of the early stage watermelon fruits.

initiation of pigment biosynthesis in white-pink flesh fruits
the color of watermelon flesh is an important quality trait and mainly determined by its carotenoid composition and content. watermelon is a natural source of lycopene, a carotenoid that contributes the red color to watermelon flesh and is known for its antioxidant properties, acting as a potent free radical scavenger  <cit> . at the immature white stage, there is little difference between the inner peel and the flesh tissue in term of color for watermelon fruits, while at the white-pink flesh stage, its flesh tissue starts to turn pink due to the accumulation of lycopene . in the present study, we determined the content of three major carotenoids, lycopene, β-carotene and lutein, at the four stages of watermelon fruit development. as shown in figure 5a, lycopene was the dominant carotenoid in watermelon fruit. its content in immature fruits was low, and then increased slightly in white-pink flesh fruits but enough to make the visible pink color of the flesh . the lycopene content increased sharply in mature fruits . the content of β-carotene kept at a very low level till the over-ripe stage, which had β-carotene content 3- <dig> times of previous stages. the content of lutein remained at the very low level throughout the watermelon fruit development . the results we obtained for carotenoid content during watermelon fruit development are similar to those reported in tomato  <cit> . we then analyzed the expression of watermelon genes in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway and identified two genes, a phytoene synthase  <dig>  and a lycopene beta cyclase , showing differential expression during fruit development . the expression of the phytoene synthase  <dig> was not detectable at immature white stage and remained high since the white-pink flesh stage, while the expression of the lycopene beta cyclase kept decreasing during the fruit development and was undetectable at the over-ripe stage. this suggests that the up-regulation of the phytoene synthase  <dig> could have generated a flux of carotenoids and the down-regulation of lycopene beta-cyclase creates a blockade downstream, leading to the accumulation of lycopene. this is consistent with the findings in tomato  <cit> . based on these results we concluded that phytoene synthase  <dig> and lycopene beta cyclase were key enzymes controlling carotenoid content in watermelon fruits and the regulatory mechanisms of carotenoid content during fruit development could be conserved between watermelon and tomato.

it is worth noting that a cinnamoyl-coa reductase  was highly expressed in the fast-growing fruit . ccr catalyses the first step in the biosynthesis pathway of monolignols, the monomeric units of lignins. lignified tissues play important roles in structural support and water/nutrient conduction  <cit> . consistent with its role in lignin biosynthesis during plant development, expression of the ccr gene was shown to be high in tissues undergoing active lignification, i.e. vascular cambium and differentiating xylem. development of vascular system in fleshy fruits is a critical component of fruit growth and expansion, because fruits serve as the nutrient sink and the vascular system provides the framework for water, nutrients, and sugars to be transported from the vegetative parts  <cit> . thus, continued growth and expansion of watermelon fruits at early stages could rely on the establishment of the vascular system and similar connection between fruit development and vascular system formation has been reported in other fleshy fruit species like strawberry  <cit> .

rapid accumulation of sugars and secondary metabolites in mature fruits
watermelon fruit at red flesh and over-ripe stages becomes much crispier and sweeter, and its flesh becomes red with accumulation of volatile compounds that gives watermelon its distinct aroma and flavor . besides color, sweetness is another important trait of fruit quality and there has been enormous interest from growers and breeders to improve the sugar content of watermelon. its sugar composition, as in many cucurbit fruits, is mainly determined by sucrose, fructose and glucose levels  <cit> . in the present study, we measured the content of these three sugars during watermelon fruit development. at immature white and white-pink flesh stages, fructose and glucose are the predominant sugars and their levels start to decline as the fruit matured. on the contrary, the content of sucrose was low in immature white and white-pink flesh fruits and then had a sharp increase in mature fruits, in which sucrose replaced fructose and glucose as the determining factor of sugar content . previous reports indicated that the sharp increase in sucrose level in a high-sucrose-accumulating watermelon cultivar was a result of fructose and glucose reduction, and sucrose made up about 70% of the total reducing sugars in mature fruit  <cit> . our data confirmed the similar trend of sugar metabolism and, in the cultivar we examined, sucrose accounted for approximately 50% of total soluble sugar in over-ripe fruits, compared to 3-7% in fruits at immature and white-pink flesh stages . we further analyzed sugar metabolism-related biochemical pathways and identified a sucrose synthase and a sucrose-phosphate synthase that were differentially expressed during watermelon fruit development . these two genes were involved in the biosynthesis of sucrose and were highly expressed in fruits at red flesh and over-ripe stages. correlation between sugar content and expression profiles of the two sugar metabolism related genes indicated that these two genes might play important roles in regulating sugar content in watermelon fruits.

a number of genes involved in the accumulation of second metabolites contributing to fruit flavor and aroma were found to be highly expressed in fruits at red flesh and/or over-ripe stages. they included ascorbate peroxidase , 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase , benzoquinone reductase , quinone reductase , flavonoid 3',5'-hdyroxylase , and squalene synthase . identification of these genes provided a rich source for further dissection of molecular mechanisms that governing fruit flavor and aroma, the important traits of fruit quality that currently are not well understood.

CONCLUSIONS
watermelon is an important fruit crop and becomes a useful model for the research of non-climacteric fruits. however, genetic and genomic resources for watermelon are very scarce, which are among the major limiting factors in watermelon research and breeding. in the present study, using the roche/ <dig> massively parallel pyrosequencing technology, we have generated more than half million watermelon ests from four stages of watermelon fruit development. these ests were de novo assembled and extensively annotated. they represent the significant expansion of the watermelon transcript catalog and provide a comprehensive material basis for future functional and expression analysis of genes of interest. the availability of these ests will also facilitate the annotation of the watermelon genome that is currently being sequenced. ssrs were also identified from these ests, which provides a valuable resource for the development of molecular markers that can be further used to facilitate the watermelon breeding program and cloning genes of interest. integrative analysis of digital gene expression and metabolite profiles provided novel insights into molecular mechanisms of watermelon fruit development and regulatory mechanisms of several import traits of watermelon fruit quality.
