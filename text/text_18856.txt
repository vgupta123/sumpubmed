BACKGROUND
the development of dna-microarray technology has enabled genome-wide expression profiling to become a valuable tool in the investigation of an organisms' gene regulation  <cit> . for our studies on gene regulation in gram-positive bacteria  <cit>  we use in-house developed dna-microarrays containing amplified dna fragments of the annotated genes of lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis il <dig>  <cit> , l. lactis ssp. cremoris mg <dig>  <cit> , bacillus subtilis  <dig>  <cit> , bacillus cereus atcc  <dig>  <cit> , and streptococcus pneumoniae tigr <dig>  <cit> .

standardization of every step in the dna-microarray procedure is crucial to correctly and efficiently perform dna-microarray experiments, and to obtain reproducible data  <cit> . in the process from manufacturing dna-microarrays to performing the actual experiments, systematic errors and / or bias in the data are introduced in each of the different steps. the effects of various factors  on the quality of dna-microarray data have been studied quite extensively albeit for experiments performed with eukaryotic systems  <cit> . in contrast, no data quality determination has yet been performed on dna-microarray data from experiments with bacterial cultures. furthermore, the effects of different array batches or the influence of the experimenter on data quality have not been included in the previous mentioned experimental designs. here, we show that the latter factors are indeed important for optimizing dna-microarray data quality.

in order to assess the reproducibility of, and factors involved in, dna-microarray data produced in our laboratory during transcriptome analyses by a number of researchers, a validation experiment was designed and implemented. this validation scheme is routinely applied to validate the dna-microarrays of the various organisms under study in our group. in addition, it allowed to set a quality standard as well as to assess sources of errors in the expression data.

we discuss a novel validation scheme and assess data quality of a number of validation experiments performed on amplicon-based dna-microarrays of l. lactis il <dig>  for any laboratory in which dna-microarray experiments are performed on a regular basis, the validation scheme will provide at the cost of only a few hybridizations, valuable information on the dna-microarray data quality. combining multiple validation experiments allows estimation of the main sources of errors.

RESULTS
dna-microarray quality assessment
six researchers working with l. lactis il <dig> slides performed nine validation experiments . general statistics on these validation datasets are listed in table  <dig>  one has to bear in mind that dna-microarrays with lower signals will yield more noisy data, and thus higher coefficients of variance . since these lower signals might also contain valuable information, they are included in the analyses described here.

no differentially expressed genes were detected
differential expression tests were performed for the factors , but no genes meeting the criteria were observed. no differential expression was expected because the hybridizations were performed with cdna derived from cells grown under  similar conditions. the resulting expression ratios were thus close to  <dig> 

cv comparison
the cvs of the validation experiments range from  <dig> % to  <dig> % with an average of  <dig> % and using about  <dig> % of the spots. the lower cvs of the  <dig> % low-intensity-spot-filtered data  indicate that a significant part of the variance originates from genes with low expression. slides  <dig> and  <dig> of each validation experiment  examine biological replicates of independent comparisons between the cultures a and b . their data quality is thus a "worst case scenario" estimate of the quality to be expected from "real" dna-microarray experiments as the validation experiments were performed with a large number of differing parameters:  different researchers performed the experiments,  on different days, while, lastly,  the cells were harvested in a growth phase in which small changes in culture optical density will result in relatively large differences in expression levels . table  <dig> shows, as expected, that data from the pooled slides  <dig> of all validation experiments  have a smaller average cv  than those of s <dig>  and s <dig> . the cv frequency distribution for s <dig> is shifted towards zero while s <dig> and s <dig> have quite similar distributions  because of intra-culture differences .

detailed comparison of two slides
the two representative validation experiments, i.e. e and h, showed clear differences in data quality . box plots of data before the lowess grid-based normalization show clear spot pin-dependent patterns in average signal levels . a non-linear intensity-dependent dye-effect in data from slide e <dig>  is evident from the curved lowess fits. the lowess curves   of slides e <dig> and h <dig> are "stacked", indicative of a grid-dependent gradient of ratios. the above-mentioned effects are normalized by using the lowess grid-based normalization method .

gene-dependent fluctuations in ratios and signals
clustering was performed on the sds of the ratio-data to investigate gene-dependent behavior across the validation experiments . cluster  <dig> contains more strongly expressed genes than cluster  <dig>  with clusters  <dig> and  <dig> encompassing genes with intermediate expression levels.

the clustering results were simplified by grouping genes
a first selection of genes was based on the l. lactis il <dig> genome annotation with the underlying assumption that related genes  are expected to show similar expression behavior. only related genes with all members occurring in the same cluster  were considered.

cell growth-related genes show large fluctuations
clustering revealed that genes with similar sd fluctuations were involved in  amino acid biosynthesis,  energy metabolism,  cell-wall synthesis, and  salvage of nucleosides and nucleotides . genes showing highest ratio and signal cvs :  are of unknown function,  are  phage-derived,  encode proteins involved in transport of various compounds, or  encode transcriptional regulators.

some genes with low expression show correlated expression fluctuations
anova
a clear correlation between cvs  and e.g. array batches or experiments could not be determined. for instance, validation experiments h and i were performed on the same dna microarray batch by the same experimenter, but yielded different cvs. the anova technique allowed estimating the contribution of several sources of errors to the total variance in the dna-microarray data of all slides . the following factors contributed significantly to the total variance: g , vg , sg , and vsg .

a the degrees of freedom results in the separate anovas are listed in the supplementary web-site  <cit> .

b assumed to consist of hybridization effects and signal-to-noise differences per slide.

c derived from the variance observed between ba and bb cultures .

d variances that are dependent on the validation experiment performed and due to day-to-day differences, identity of the experimenter, and dna microarray batch differences.

e due to overlap in levels, the contribution of these interactions were individually determined.

f a change from  <dig> to  <dig> spot-pins used for array spotting coincided with a switch in the rna isolation method.

the vsg interaction detailed
in order to distinguish the separate sources of errors in the vsg interaction, additional variance analyses were performed with combinations of  <dig> slides:  by omitting slide  <dig>  the vsg interaction  decreased with  <dig>  %;  by omitting slides  <dig> or  <dig>  the vsg interaction  decreased with  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively; and  the decrease in the vsg interactions coincides with an increase of the vg interaction. this leads to the conclusion that variances occur on each slide  and may, in part, be due to hybridization effects. since the variance for a particular slide  is omitted from the variance analyses, the vsg interaction will decrease, but the vg interaction will increase . this  <dig>  % variance is assumed to be the same for each of the three slides. the larger effect of s <dig> and s <dig> compared to s <dig> in the vsg interaction is probably caused by the fact that on these slides inter-culture comparisons were performed. since dye-effects are assumed to be global, it can be concluded that the intra-culturing differences  account for the  <dig>  and  <dig>  % larger decrease in the vsg interaction . the variance introduced by the ba and bb cultures is quite reproducible  and is caused by rna isolation and labeling .

slide and sampling differences can be determined from vsg
the variance of s <dig> versus the pooled s <dig> and s <dig>  in the vsg interaction decreased with  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %, with the variance in the vg interaction remaining virtually unchanged. by combining s <dig> and s <dig>  the gene × array interactions occurring specifically on s <dig> and s <dig> are pooled. they are, thus, not accommodated in the vg interaction, but rather in the residual error. the remaining  <dig>  % variance in the vsg interaction still contains the gene × array interactions for s <dig>  and sampling differences .

day-to-day differences are most prominent in the vg interaction
the vg interaction contains differences between validation experiments : the dna microarray batch used , day-to-day differences , the researcher performing the experiment , and spot-pin / rna isolation method used . due to confounding of these factors, a less efficient estimation of their relative contributions was unavoidable. however, the contributions of bg, pg, ag, du in relation to the vg interaction could be determined . the day-to-day differences were estimated to have the largest contribution to the variance, followed by experimenter, the dna microarray batch, and lastly a relatively low contribution of switching the rna isolation method .

discussion
the validation procedure presented here was implemented to provide a standardized method to assess dna-microarray data quality generated in our laboratory and should be well-suited for use in other laboratories. a workable trade-off between costs, time investment, and data-quality was obtained by using only three dna-microarray slides for each validation experiment. this scheme is suitable for identifying factors that yield "unreliable" data . in a number of cases, the validation experiment even identified experimenters who did not flag bad spots stringently enough.

assessment of high-throughput gene expression data quality is a challenging task. a potential problem arises from the fact that many studies do not describe in detail the resulting amount of data on which statistic analyses was based. this information is, however, crucial to determine data-quality. to demonstrate the effect of filtering on data quality, statistics were also calculated for data in which  <dig> % of the lowest intensity spots were removed . these rigorously filtered data do show improved data quality, but at the expense of many measurements that could contain valuable information. the  <dig> % low-intensity spot filter employed in our study was selected after careful examination of data from various dna-microarray experiments performed in our laboratory. some targets with low expression levels allowed grouping genes by function, revealing trends that would have been difficult to discern with more rigorous filtering. a thorough discussion of these results is, however, outside the scope of this study.

the data quality of the validation experiments described in this paper proved to be satisfactory, while at same time a maximum amount of data was preserved. one has to bear in mind that a significant part of the variance in our data is caused by varying factors . in addition, the quality of the glass surfaces used in this study was lower than that of presently used superamine glass slides . together with recently implemented increased stringency of clean-room rules, this will increase data-quality even more. the average cv value for the validation experiments was  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % for s <dig> and s <dig> with use of  <dig> % of the spots . these results are comparable to cvs, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> %, reported for a number of studies using cdna derived from eukaryotic cell cultures hybridized on various dna microarray platforms  <cit> . for other dna-microarray experiments performed in our laboratory the data quality is considerably higher  stipulating that in effect, the average cv of about  <dig> % described in this study is an underestimation of the data quality one could obtain.

by mining the data from several validation datasets it was possible to determine which factors contribute to the variance in normalized dna-microarray data. the following factors were identified :  validation experiments ,  sampling ,  array × gene , gene variances , and dye-effects . the contributions of rna isolation and labeling to the variance were quite low . additional variance analyses showed that the day-to-day differences contribute most to the  <dig> % variance observed for the vg interaction, followed by the experimenter, the dna microarray batch, and lastly a change in the rna isolation method . the contribution of dye-effects was determined to be only  <dig> %, which is low compared to the contribution of dye-effects determined for in studies from chen et al. and dombrowski et al.  <cit> . the latter study describes the use of a direct labeling kit. in contrast, indirect labeling was used in our study, in which differential hybridization of cy <dig> and cy5-labeled cdna is anticipated. direct-labeling adds, next to this differential hybridization,  preference of the reverse transcriptase enzyme for the cy <dig> label and  prolonged exposure to air and light of the dyes increasing the chance of oxidation and / or bleaching. the main contributing factors identified in this study are in agreement with a number of studies involving cdna derived from eukaryotic tissue cultures  <cit> . in contrast to these studies, we were able to attribute a relatively large contribution of the total variance to specific sources of errors  because of the efficient design of the validation experiment described here. since the contributions of day-to-day variation, dna microarray batch differences, and the experimenter to the variance amounted up to  <dig> %, it can be concluded that even higher data-quality can be obtained when experiments are performed under identical conditions.

the anova model used does not account for gene-to-gene variances. additional variance analyses were performed with datasets of which the  <dig> % most noisy genes  were omitted. in these experiments, the relative contribution of the various factors identified above remained unchanged , indicating that the proposed procedure is robust and that its results are not dependent on a relatively small portion of noisy genes.

in this paper, data from hybridizations with rna derived from the same experimental conditions were used. to examine whether the probes used on the slides are correct and whether observed gene expression levels are accurate, experiments should be carried out which measure known differentially expressed genes. a number of such studies in which targets were identified by dna-microarray experiments , and subsequently verified by alternative techniques , have successfully been performed in our laboratory .

the validation experiments described in this study were designed to be a "worst case scenario." data quality proved to be good even though they were obtained at challenging conditions:  flask-grown cells,  harvesting in a growth phase in which relatively large changes in gene-expressions occur, and  change of factors . these factors represent the conditions under which dna microarray experiments are performed in our laboratory. another laboratory could have different factors and levels: e.g. only one researcher that performs the experiments or a different organism under study. such a laboratory should perform the validation experiments to determine the contribution of the factors that play a role in their particular case. the results of clustering indicate that functionally related genes share specific behaviour across the validation experiments . the significant expression levels and relatively large fluctuations in ratios of the ybg, ybj, and yia gene groups are probably due to biological variations . furthermore, one can conclude that data from even genes with very low expression can reveal interesting trends. by preserving the maximum amount of data, one might be able to discern more subtle differences in expression levels of genes with low expression.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper a novel validation scheme was employed to assess data quality and sources of errors of dna-microarrays. even in the case that  <dig> % of the data were preserved and the experiments were performed at challenging conditions, the coefficient of variance was at an acceptable  <dig> %. clustering experiments showed that trends could be detected from genes with very low expression. using anova, day-to-day as well as experimenter-dependent variances were found to contribute strongly to the variance, while dye and culturing contributions to the variance were relatively modest. the validation scheme thus allows determining conditions that could be used to obtain dna-microarray data of improved quality.
