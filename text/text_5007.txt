BACKGROUND
most important molecular processes in the cell rely on the interaction between biomolecules. understanding the molecular basis of the recognition in a functional biological complex is thus a fundamental step for possible biomedical and biotechnological applications. however, the 3d structure of a significant fraction of biomolecular complexes is difficult to solve experimentally. in this scenario, the development of accurate protein-protein docking programs is making this kind of simulations an effective tool to predict the 3d structure and the surface of interaction between the molecular partners in macromolecular complexes  <cit> . unfortunately, correctly scoring the obtained solutions to extract native-like ones is still an open problem  <cit> , which is recently also object of assessment in capri , a community-wide blind docking experiment  <cit> . as a consequence, the confidence to have a near-native solution among the ten best ranked ones is still an unreached task  <cit> . this requires the accurate and tedious screening of many docking models in the analysis step.

typically, the first step of a docking simulation generates a large number, around 105- <dig>  of 3d models . such decoys are then clusterized on the basis of rmsd values, usually calculated on the atoms of the smaller molecular partner   <cit> . the different solutions are ranked according to the cluster population: the most populated the cluster, the higher the rank. however, rmsd has two major limitations: i) its statistical significance is length dependent and ii) it is a global metric, that may not be able to characterize local similarities. as a consequence, solutions belonging to different rmsd-based clusters may share a notable number of intermolecular contacts, pointing essentially to the same interface. therefore, as already reported  <cit> , rmsd cannot be the only descriptor for the similarity of multiple docking solutions. indeed, in the capri experiment the correctness of a prediction, i.e. its similarity to the native structure, is assessed not only by means of rmsd based criteria, but also from the conservation of ligand-receptor contacts, as compared to the native structure  <cit> . alternative scores have also been proposed to evaluate the correctness of a docking prediction, based on the geometric distance between the interfaces, and the residue-residue contact similarity  <cit> .

however, the normal case in real-life research is having many different docking solutions to analyse and obviously no native structure to compare them to. therefore, it would be of great utility both for bioinformaticians and wet biologists to have programs and tools to easily and effectively analyse and compare multiple docking solutions, based on criteria other than 'simple' rmsd. most of all, it would be useful to visualize the consensus of multiple docking solutions, in order to appreciate at a glance which is the conservation rate of the predicted interface and which are the residues most often predicted as interacting.

as a matter of fact, if different docking solutions, especially from a series of well recognized programs, point to the same interacting regions, it is likely that the prediction can be better trusted. consequently, it will be reasonable to focus attention, as for instance in site-directed mutagenesis experiments, on the residues most frequently predicted to be involved in the interaction. the concept of "consensus" has indeed been widely demonstrated to improve the performance of bioinformatics tools in many fields, including the prediction of protein and rna secondary structure  <cit> , of membrane protein topology  <cit> , of protein retention in bacterial membrane  <cit> , of docking small ligands to proteins  <cit> , etc. recently, consensus interface prediction has also been used to improve the performance of macromolecular docking simulations  <cit> .

however, although many valuable tools have been made available to analyse the interface in biomolecular complexes  <cit> , no tool has been developed to the aim of measuring and visualizing the consensus of multiple docking solutions. we recently developed cocomaps , a comprehensive tool to analyse and visualize the interface in biological complexes, by making use of intermolecular contact maps  <cit> . we have shown that intermolecular contact maps can be very effective in providing an immediate 2d-view of the interaction, allowing to easily discriminate between similar and different binding solutions. they represent a sort of fingerprint of the complex, providing the crucial information in a ready-to-read form.

here we use intermolecular contact maps as the basis for a novel tool, cons-cocomaps , developed to measure and visualize the conservation of inter-residue contacts in multiple docking solutions. cons-cocomaps provides both numerical values of the contacts conservation and a graphical representation in the form of a "consensus map". to show its performance, here we applied cons-cocomaps to the analysis and visualization of a few test cases taken from recent capri rounds.

methods
given an ensemble of n models of the same biomolecular complex, the pairwise contacts conservation score, cpairij, between models i and j is calculated as in eq.  <dig> 

  cpairij=ncij/ <dig> 

where nci and ncj are the total number of inter-residue contacts in models i and j, respectively, and ncij is the total number of inter-residue contacts common to models i and j. following this definition, the average pairwise contacts conservation score cpairav simply is the value of cpairij averaged over all the possible pairs of models in the considered ensemble, see eq.  <dig> 

  cpairav= ∑i,j>incpairijn/ <dig> 

however, eq  <dig>  can be generalized to a conservation score defined over all the n models in the considered ensemble, as in eq. <dig> 

  c100=nc100∑inncin 

where nc <dig> is the total number of inter-residue contacts common to all  the models in the ensemble. the contacts conservation score of eq.  <dig> can be extended to measure any amount of inter-residue contacts common to a given percentage of analysed models. for instance, c <dig> is calculated as in eq.  <dig>  where nc <dig> is the total number of inter-residue contacts conserved in 70% of the analysed models.

  c70=nc70∑inncin 

the total number of inter-residue contacts in an ensemble of n models, nt, is calculated as in eq.  <dig> 

  nt= ∑innci. 

finally, on a residue level we define the conservation rate, crkl, of eq.  <dig>  where nckl is the total number of models where residues k and l are in contact.

  crkl=nckln. 

within this work, two residues are defined in contact if any pair of atoms belonging to the two residues is closer than a cut-off distance of  <dig> Å, which is the threshold distance adopted in the assessment of capri predictions to define native residue-residue contacts  <cit> . conservation rates can be plotted in the form of consensus contact maps, which are depicted in a grey scale. the highest conservation corresponds to a black dot, absence of conservation corresponds to white, and contacts at increasing conservation appear in darker grey.

all the programs under cons-cocomaps have been written in python, taking advantage of python libraries such as scipy and matplotlib. it is freely available as a web tool at the url  <cit> ).

capri models
the docking models for recent capri targets were downloaded from the official web site . we selected seven recent protein-protein targets  for which the docking models were made available to the public. four of them, t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  have at least one medium quality prediction and are more extensively discussed in the text. a total of  <dig> capri models have been analysed,  <dig> for target t <dig>  round  <dig>   <dig> for target  <dig>  round  <dig>   <dig> for target  <dig>  round  <dig>   <dig> for target  <dig>  round  <dig>   <dig> for target  <dig>  round  <dig>   <dig> for target  <dig>  round  <dig>  and  <dig> for target  <dig>  round  <dig> . note that targets t <dig> and t <dig> refer to the same native complex. the quality score  for each predictor was calculated by summing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for each incorrect, acceptable, medium quality and high quality solution, respectively, as assessed in capri  <cit> . predictors which submitted less than the ten allowed models and those who submitted models with a ligand and/or receptor sequence not corresponding to the target were excluded from the analysis. l_rmsd is the pair-wise rmsd calculated on all the heavy atoms of the ligand after a lsq rms fit of the receptor invariant residues backbone, as in the capri assessment  <cit> .

RESULTS
given a number of multiple docking solutions, we calculated the conservation score of the inter-residue contacts at different percentages, from  <dig> to 100%. for instance, c <dig> gives the amount of inter-residue contacts which are conserved in 70% of the compared models. when only two models are compared, the pair-wise conservation score,cpairij, is calculated. cons-cocomaps then plots the inter-residue contacts conservation to an intermolecular contact map, that we call "consensus map".

the conservation of inter-residue contacts has been here measured and visualized with cons-cocomaps for a total of  <dig> models submitted to capri for seven different targets: t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> . the percentage of correct solutions among those submitted is 10-11% for t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> and 5% for t <dig>  for the remaining targets, t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  it is instead much lower: 1% and 0% and  <dig> %, respectively .

inter-residue conservation versus l_rmsd
the pair-wise conservation score, cpairij, between all the models within each of the capri targets t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> have been plotted versus the corresponding l_rmsd values in figure  <dig>  as expected, cpairij rapidly decreases as the l_rmsd increases, with cpairij approaching to zero at l_rmsd higher than 30- <dig> Å. the cpairij distribution is significantly spread out, even at cpairij values around  <dig>  , and several outliers are indeed observed that contemporarily show either low cpairij and low l_rmsd values or high cpairij and high l_rmsd values. as an example, the 3d representation of the models m <dig> and m <dig> submitted by the p <dig> predictor for t <dig>  responsible for the point outlined by the arrows, is shown in the same figure. the l_rmsd for their superimposition is as high as  <dig>  Å, notwithstanding a pair-wise conservation score cpairij of  <dig>  is calculated. this is due to a significant conformational change undergone by both the receptor and the ligand in the two models , which causes a remarkably different orientation of the ligand. nevertheless, regions involved in the interaction are substantially the same, because the ligand somehow "follows" the receptor in its conformational change. this case and many others demonstrate once more that the rmsd cannot be selected as the only descriptors for the similarity of two docking solutions and that descriptors directly describing the property of interest, in this case the interface, should be used  <cit> .

conservation and consensus maps for the multiple solutions submitted by each predictor
conservation scores have also been calculated for each set of ten models submitted for each capri target by the same predictor. c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> are reported in the additional file  <dig>  they correspond to the amount of inter-residue contacts which are conserved in 30%, 50% and 70% of the models, respectively. the average cpairav and the quality score, q-score, for each predictor, obtained on the basis of the capri assessment, are also reported.

as expected, the inter-residue conservation rate within each set of multiple solutions submitted by each predictor is very variable. as an illustrative example, in figure 2a-b, the graphical cons-cocomaps outputs  are shown for the set of ten predictions submitted by predictors p <dig> and p <dig> for target t <dig>  for comparison, the intermolecular contact map for the native structure  is also reported . the calculated cpairav values are  <dig>  and  <dig>  for predictors p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively. visual inspection of figure 2a-b immediately indicates that the solutions proposed by predictor p <dig> are very conservative as concerns the predicted inter-residue contacts, whereas the predicted inter-residue contacts in the solutions proposed by predictor p <dig> are extremely diverse and spread out all over the map. further, the maps of figure 2b-c also immediately show that the consensus contact map of predictor p <dig> is extremely similar to the contact map of the native complex structure. in fact, predictor p <dig> performed very well in this test case, having one acceptable, two medium quality and five high quality predictions. on the contrary, predictor p <dig> had only incorrect predictions.

we noted that there is indeed a nice correlation, especially for targets t <dig> and t <dig>  between the success of the predictor and a high conservation of the inter-residue contacts. however, it is worth to remark that the opposite does not hold true, i.e. we also observed cases where a predictor submitted very similar predictions in terms of inter-residue contacts but they were far away from the native structure. for instance, the ten predictions submitted by predictor p <dig> for target t <dig> share an average cpairav as high as  <dig> , notwithstanding all the predictions have been assessed as incorrect. the corresponding consensus map is shown and compared with the native structure contact map in the additional file  <dig> 

consensus maps for the multiple solutions submitted by all the predictors
overall conservation scores of the inter-residue contacts in all the models submitted for the analysed targets are quite low. conservation scores at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 20% are reported in table  <dig> both for all the docking models and for only the incorrect solutions. they correspond to the number of inter-residue contacts which are conserved in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> models out of  <dig>  divided by the average number of contacts per model. from table  <dig> it is apparent that the conservation of inter-residue contacts in t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> is particularly low. the conservation score of contacts common to the 5% of all the models, including the correct ones, is indeed below  <dig>  . at higher percentages the conservation scores for these targets are zero, with the only exception of t <dig>  whose c <dig> value is  <dig> .

a calculations performed upon excluding all the correct predictions.

on the contrary, c <dig> assumes higher and similar values for the other three targets, from  <dig>  for target t <dig> to  <dig>  for target t <dig>  these values are remarkably lower when the correct predictions are excluded from the analysis. c <dig> values are also quite similar and range from the  <dig>  for target t <dig> to  <dig>  for target t <dig>  c <dig> values are more variable, ranging from  <dig>  for target t <dig> to  <dig>  for target t <dig>  exclusion of the correct predictions causes a dramatic decrease of the c <dig> values, which approach to zero. at percentages of 20% or more, the conservation score is not higher than  <dig>  for any of the analysed targets.

conservation rates at the residue level have been plotted in consensus maps and are reported in figure  <dig> for t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> and in the additional file  <dig> for t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  together with the intermolecular contact map of the corresponding native structures . the consensus maps reported in figures 2d, f, h, j and 2sb,d,f therefore represent the consensus emerging from the analysis of  <dig> to  <dig> different solutions, for each target, submitted by different predictors and obtained and selected on the basis of different methods and criteria.

as a consequence of their very low conservation scores, the consensus maps of t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> are quite spread out and only for t <dig> a week signal emerges from the background noise . on the contrary, in case of targets t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  some darker hot spots, due to the best conserved inter-residue contacts in the multiple solutions, clearly emerge . interestingly, analysis of the cons-cocomaps outputs indicates that among the ten inter-residue contacts with highest conservation rates, reported in table  <dig> several correspond to native inter-residue contacts. indeed, for targets t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  seven, nine and eight of the ten most conserved contacts correspond to distances within  <dig> Å in the native structure  <cit>  . considering that only ~10% of the capri models for the three targets was assessed to be correct , this indicates that focusing on the consensus of predicted inter-residue contacts, rather than on the correctness of the entire models, can significantly increase the success rate of the prediction. importantly, hot spots of the interactions are highlighted by this approach, such as for instance residue tyr <dig> of the t <dig> ligand , whose mutation to alanine has been experimentally shown to dramatically decrease the ligand-receptor affinity  <cit> . a useful consensus, five correct contacts among the ten most conserved contacts, also emerges for t <dig>  for which only 5% of the models was assessed to be correct . further, when drawing the consensus maps for targets t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> using only the incorrect solutions, some inter-residue contacts corresponding to the native ones still emerge, and are clearly distinguishable from the noise . in particular, considering only the incorrect models submitted for t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  two, seven and four contacts, respectively, correspond to native ones . surprisingly, even t <dig>  having no medium/high quality prediction, presents three native contacts among the ten most conserved ones . quite strikingly, these findings indicate that the consensus of many solutions, even incorrect according to the capri definition, may point to the correct inter-residue contacts. if confirmed, this result could be of great interest and utility in applications such as mutagenesis experiments design, considering that the main aim of bioinformaticians and wet biologists, when performing macromolecular docking simulations, is often to predict the residues at the interface, more than the fine details of the biomolecular complex.

the ten most conserved inter-residue contacts are reported for targets t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  together with corresponding distances in the native structures  <cit> . distances above  <dig> Å are outlined in bold.

CONCLUSIONS
here we presented cons-cocomaps, a novel tool to easily measure and visualize the consensus in multiple docking solutions. cons-cocomaps uses the conservation of inter-residue contacts as an estimate of the similarity between different docking solutions. the conservation of ligand-receptor contacts is indeed used as one of the fundamental criteria in capri for assessing the similarity of a predicted complex to the native structure, and recently it has been emphasized that it can be the most useful descriptor when looking at the biological significance of the prediction, i.e. the individuation of the interface area  <cit> . to visualize the conservation, cons-cocomaps uses intermolecular contact maps, that we recently showed to be a very effective way to visualize a biomolecular complex interface  <cit> . there is virtually no limit on the number of models that can be compared by cons-cocomaps. this novel tool is freely available to the scientific community  and can straightforwardly be applied to the analysis of the outputs of one or more docking programs.

the application of cons-cocomaps to some test-cases taken from recent capri rounds shows that it is efficient in highlighting even a very weak consensus. interestingly, in three out of the seven analysed cases, t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  consensus maps clearly point to the native contacts . in other two cases, t <dig> and t <dig>  although the consensus is less visually apparent from the maps , three and five native contacts, respectively, are included among the ten most conserved inter-residue contacts . importantly, in none of the analysed cases a false-positive consensus emerged. this opens the road to further studies to test and prove whether the consensus of a large number of docking solutions may be used to successfully predict residue-residue contacts in biomolecular complexes.
