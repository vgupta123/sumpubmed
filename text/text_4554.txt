BACKGROUND
rice  is a staple food for more than half of the world’s population. india is believed to be a center of origin and diversity of rice. india is the second most rice producer in the world and 65 % of its population depends on rice as a staple food. rice is a model cereal crop with small genome size, short generation time, diploid  and amenable for genetic manipulation. due to its global importance, several genomes of rice cultigen including japonica , indica  and aus  have been sequenced. currently gold standard assembly and annotation are available for japonica rice. although over 80 % of rice cultivation in the world under indica rice cultivation however, genomic resources are lacking for this subspecies. due to non-availability of proper genome assembly, indica genome studies are still using nipponbare genome as a reference. this will introduce the potential bias in analysis and may not capture conclusive results at the nucleotide and chromosomal level for indica subspecies  <cit> . thus, we and other researchers  <cit>  believe that creating an indica reference rice genome is essential for genome-wide studies, which will enable genome assisted indica rice breeding program.

here we report the de novo genome assembly and annotation of indica cultivar, hr- <dig>  this cultivar was bred and released in india . it has good agronomic traits, but highly susceptible to blast disease  <cit> , caused by magnaporthe oryzae. rice blast is a serious constraint in rice production and utilization of resistant  genes in variety development has become the most effective method of blast disease management. sequencing of highly resistant and susceptible varieties will enable the identification of novel r genes and their deployment in rice breeding programme. in addition to hr- <dig>  we resequenced whole genomes of three indica cultivars, which are highly susceptible  and resistant  to rice blast. our indica rice sequencing efforts have complemented the global rice genomic resources, which eventually will help to characterize indica rice germplasm to identify genes for agronomically important traits including disease, pest and yield attributing traits.

methods
indica rice cultivars and genome size estimation
the hr- <dig>  was derived from raja hansa . subsequently hr- <dig> was used to develop hamsa  and tellahamsa  rice varieties . the co- <dig> variety was developed by crossing culture <dig> and kannagi. these two varieties have been widely used as susceptible checks in rice blast screening nursery. tetep and tadukan are used as resistance checks, and donor parents for blast resistance breeding, however the genealogy information is not available. the seeds of hr- <dig>  co- <dig>  tetep and tadukan were sown in a pvc pot containing red earth and fertilizers. twenty one days old leaves from co- <dig>  hr- <dig>  tetep and tadukan were collected and chopped into pieces in nuclear isolation buffer  of nonidet p- <dig> containing 2 mg/ml rnase a) and samples were processed as per the protocol suggested by krishna  <cit> . debris was filtered and stained nuclei were analysed using bd facs at central imaging and flow cytometry facility , c-camp, ncbs, bengaluru, india. values of rice nuclear dna was estimated by comparing rice nuclear peak on the linear scale with the peak for pisum sativum included as an internal standard.

nucleic acid isolation
genomic dna was isolated from four  varieties as per the manufacturer’s instruction . dna quality was assessed by nanodrop and dna was quantified using qubit .

paired-end  and matepair  library preparation, and illumina sequencing
one micro gram of genomic dna was fragmented in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> bases using ultra sonicator . then pe library of hr- <dig>  co- <dig>  tetep and tadukan samples were prepared using tru seq dna sample preparation kit v <dig>  as per the manufacture’s instruction. pe libraries were sequenced using illumina hiseq <dig> and the length of sequence was  <dig> nts from both ends of the fragment. the mp library  was prepared only for hr- <dig> sample by nextera mp sample preparation kit  and sequenced 2× <dig> nts by illumina hiseq <dig> 

strand-specific rna seq library preparation and sequencing
total rna was isolated from hr- <dig> leaves using direct-zol rna miniprep kit  and rna integrity and quantity was assessed by bioanalyzer using agilent rna  <dig> nano chip. truseq stranded total rna library preparation kit v <dig>  from illumina was used to prepare strand-specific rna sequencing  library by following manufacture’s instruction. the ssrna-seq library was sequenced 2x <dig> nts by illumina hiseq <dig> 

pacbio library preparation and sequencing
around  <dig> micrograms of high quality genomic dna was sheared using hydroshear. the bluepippin was used to select 20kb double-stranded dna fragments. then, dna fragments were end repaired and ligated with universal hairpin adapters. subsequent steps were followed as per the manufacture’s instruction to prepare smrtbell library. the library was sequenced in pacbio rs smrt instrument.

illumina data output and data preprocessing
the low quality bases  and adapter sequence contaminations in raw reads of illumina sequencing  was processed using fastx-toolkit .

short read  de novo genome assembly of hr-12
the quality processed illumina reads  were used for de novo assembly using three de novo genome assemblers viz., velvet  <cit> , soapdenovo <dig>  <cit>  and masurca  <cit> . the quality of genome assemblies were assessed using quast  <cit> .

gap filling of short read assembly using pacbio long reads, contigs scaffolding and anchoring
raw pacbio reads were used for gap filling and to upgrade short read assembly using pbjelly pipeline  <cit> . gap filled assembly was further scaffolded by l_rna_scaffolder  <cit>  using transcripts assembled by trinity  <cit> . the pseudomolecules of hr- <dig> were constructed by anchoring hr- <dig> contigs on to pseudomolecules of nipponbare genome  with abacas  <cit> . the synteny map of rice genomes was generated with default parameters by symap  <cit> . the genome completeness of short read and gap filled assemblies were checked by cegma  <cit> .

gene prediction and functional annotation of hr- <dig> genome
the hr- <dig> pseudomolecules were subjected for gene prediction with maker-p  <cit>  version  <dig> . <dig> by providing expressed sequences  of oryza . protein domain structures and gene ontology  terms were assigned using interproscan <dig> software  <cit> . functional annotation of genes was done by searching homology against rice protein sequences of swissprot  using blastp alignments with an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig>  the synonymous  and non-synonymous  substitution rate was calculated using ng  <cit>  method in ka/ks calculator  <cit> .

annotation of hr- <dig> specific genes
nipponbare  and 93– <dig> gene models were downloaded from msu rice genome ftp site  and bgi  site, respectively. the homology search was carried out with blastp using nipponbare and 93– <dig> proteins as subject and hr- <dig> proteins as a query; the e-value cutoff was set to 1e- <dig> 

repeat identification and prediction of simple sequence repeats 
de novo repeat prediction was performed using repeat masker  <dig> . <dig>  using oryza sativa repeat library in repbase as a reference. the ssrs were predicted using microsatellite identification tool  <cit> . rice ssr markers in gramene website  were used for performing an electronic pcr  <cit>   to check polymorphic and novel ssrs in hr- <dig> genome.

identification of snps, indels and functional annotation of variants
we used illumina data of hr- <dig>  co- <dig>  tetep and tadukan for variant analysis. the high quality  illumina reads were mapped to nipponbare genome using burrows-wheeler aligner  v <dig> .9a  <cit> . alignments with mapping quality  < <dig>  were filtered using samtools  <cit> . duplicate reads were removed using picard tool v <dig>  . we performed local realignment around indels to correct mapping related artifacts using indelrealigner tool in gatk v <dig> - <dig>  then base quality recalibration was performed using baserecalibrator tool in gatk v <dig> - <dig>  variant calling was performed with a minimum phred-scaled confidence threshold of  <dig>  and a minimum phred-scaled confidence threshold for emitting variants at  <dig> using haplotypecaller in gatk v <dig> - <dig> across all four samples  <cit> . functional annotation and genetic consequences  of common variants  of susceptible and resistant varieties was annotated using snpeff tool v <dig> b  <cit> . the nipponbare genome version  <dig>  was used as a reference to annotate snps and indels.

mining of blast disease resistance genes in indica cultivars
the sequences of twenty-two cloned blast r-genes  were subjected to blastp alignment  with proteins sequences of hr- <dig>  co- <dig>  ir <dig> , tetep, and tadukan.

RESULTS
de novo short read hr- <dig> genome assembly
the genome of indica rice cultivar, hr- <dig> was assembled using combination of short reads  from illumina and long reads  from pacific biosciences . initially, the illumina short reads were assembled using three de novo assemblers velvet, soapdenovo <dig> and masurca. among three assemblers, masurca covered highest genome size of  <dig>  mb and it had least number of n’s as compared to other two assemblers. all three assemblers resulted comparatively lower contig n <dig> , which might result due to inherent disadvantages of short read assemblies, such as poor repeat resolution  <cit> , missing exons and genes and genes split between scaffolds  <cit> . less number of contigs in velvet  <cit>  and soapdenovo <dig>  <cit>  assemblies were because of higher number of ‘n’s in the assembly, which were used to merge adjacent contigs into scaffolds . based on quality assessment by quast, masurca assembly was chosen for further analysis since it showed more improvement with respect to genome coverage , lower number of gaps  and higher number of genes covered  .

improvement of short read indica rice genome assembly using pacbio long reads
to improve assembly quality and overcome the limitations of short read assembly, hr- <dig> genome was sequenced using pacbio rs smrt platform with 20x coverage. the pacbio reads were used to fill the gaps in the short read assembly  which improved hr- <dig> genome with respect to genome size, n <dig> and number of contigs/scaffolds. the genome assembly size was increased by  <dig>  mb which accounts for over 86 % of estimated hr- <dig> genome . the average genome size of four indica cultivars was found to be higher  as compared to previous report  <cit>  . the n <dig> of gap filled assembly was increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb. similarly, the number of scaffolds was reduced from  <dig> to  <dig> . the core eukaryotic genes  mapping approach has resulted  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % genes in short read and gap filled assemblies, respectively. according to our data, the gap filled indica rice, hr- <dig> genome assembly is much better with respect to genome size, number of genes, scaffold n <dig> and genome completeness as compared to other rice genomes including indica , aus  and japonica  . the overall assembly quality comparison with other published genomes reiterated the importance of pacbio long reads in generating gold standard genomes for complex eukaryotic organisms. in a recent study, reference mapping of sequence reads of  <dig> rice accessions to japonica , indica  and aus  genomes showed higher rate of mapping to kasalath followed by 93– <dig> and nipponbare genomes  <cit> . this indicates that 93– <dig> genome is not well assembled and annotated  <cit> .fig.  <dig> diagram depicting the assembly gaps closed by pacbio long reads. gaps in short read assembly are shown in broken rectangles and gene models are represented in genome annotation track

hr- <dig> contigs ordering on nipponbare chromosomes
ordering and orienting of contigs/scaffolds onto pseudomolecules has facilitated identification of gaps, closure of gaps and also comparative whole genome analyses. we scaffolded hr- <dig> contigs by utilizing stranded rna sequencing data, which reduced scaffold numbers from  <dig> to  <dig>  over 73 % of hr- <dig> contigs  anchored onto pseudomolecules of nipponbare with 80 % sequence identity and remaining  <dig> were unanchored. the unanchored contigs could be part of structural variants like insertions, inversions and translocations. the minimum and maximum contig length of unanchored contigs was  <dig> and 392500 bp, respectively. the n <dig> was 36469 bp with an average contigs length of 6642 bp. nearly  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  of hr- <dig> contigs aligned to nipponbare and 93– <dig> genomes with 100 % query coverage and 80 % sequence similarity, which confirmed that unaligned contigs were part of rice genome. around  <dig>  %  of contigs did not show any alignment to nipponbare genome indicating their absence in the reference genome.

the synteny map of hr- <dig>  nipponbare and 93– <dig>  showed that most of the genomic blocks conserved across all three genomes with few translocations. around 79 % and 74 % of hr- <dig> genome is in syntenic with nipponbare and 93– <dig> genomes, respectively which restate that 93– <dig> genome is not well assembled.

gene prediction and functional annotation
the gene prediction using maker-p in gap filled assembly of hr- <dig> genome yielded  <dig>  protein-coding transcripts. we performed two-way comparison of genes from short read and gap filled assemblies, resulting into  <dig>  genes with 100 % identity. in addition,  <dig> genes were annotated which were unique to gap filled assembly but absent in short read assembly. about  <dig>  %  of genes were fragmented in short read assembly as compared to gap filled assembly. this indicates that use of pacbio reads has significantly improved the indica rice genome annotation.

genes of gap filled assembly were also compared with genes of nipponbare and 93– <dig>  there were  <dig>  genes  commonly present in both hr- <dig> and nipponbare. similarly  <dig>  genes were commonly present in hr- <dig> and 93– <dig>  this indicates that over ~97 % of annotated rice genes from indica  and japonica  were annotated in hr- <dig> gap filled assembly. overall,  <dig> genes were unique to hr- <dig> genome in comparison with nipponbare and 93– <dig> genomes . these unique genes in hr- <dig> were annotated and classified as proteins of unknown function , uncharacterized proteins  and proteins with known function . there were  <dig> resistance genes with nbs-lrr, lrr and kinase domains .

ka/ks analysis for annotated proteins
to determine the evolutionary selection pressure on proteome between indica  and japonica  genomes, synonymous amino acids substitution rates  and non-synonymous amino acids substitution rates  were calculated. the ka/ks ratio can reflect the selection pressure between gene pairs  caused by evolutionary forces like natural mutations. this homolog group analyses resulted  <dig> and  <dig> gene pairs between indica-indica , and indica-japonica , respectively. homolog groups were classified into three categories based on ka/ks ratio with probability value of < <dig>  . the indica-indica homologs comparison yielded  <dig> and  <dig> genes being positively and negatively selected with probability value of < <dig>  , respectively. similarly, indica-japonica homologs comparison showed  <dig> and  <dig> genes were under positive  and negative  selection, respectively .

genome-wide comparison of ssrs and snps in sequenced genomes
the ssrs are repetitive dna sequences used as co-dominant molecular markers to determine genetic diversity and mapping of genes/qtls. identification of ssrs in genome sequences will increase the availability of more genomic resources. in total,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ssrs were identified in illumina hr- <dig> assembly, long read hr- <dig> assembly, nipponbare and 93– <dig> genomes, respectively . mono and di-nucleotide repeats were more in hr- <dig> genome as compared to nipponbare and 93– <dig>  the ‘at’  and aag, agg  repeats were more predominant in hr- <dig> genome . the ‘at’ rich di-nucleotide repeats are reported to be most abundant in rice genome as compared to other ssrs  <cit> . among tetra- repeats; aaac, aaag, aaat, aacc, aacg, aagg, acat, acgc, acgg, acgt and agat types were more abundant in hr- <dig> genome  as compared to nipponbare and 93– <dig> genomes.fig.  <dig> genome-wide comparison of hr- <dig>  93– <dig> and nipponbare genomes for snps, ssrs and repeats. a number of snps,  number of ssrs,  distribution of repeat elements and  density of repeats on chromosome  <dig> of hr- <dig> genome



more than  <dig> ssrs are available in the gramene database . these sequences were used for e-pcr analysis in hr- <dig>  nipponbare and 93– <dig> genomes. there were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  ssrs mapped to hr- <dig>  nipponbare and 93– <dig> genomes, respectively. this indicates that publicly available ssr markers were skewed towards japonica genome. among  <dig> ssrs from hr- <dig> assembly,  <dig> ssrs were monomorphic and  <dig> ssrs were polymorphic across three genomes. the pair-wise comparison of polymorphic ssrs has yielded  <dig> polymorphic ssrs between hr- <dig> and nipponbare, and  <dig> ssrs polymorphic between hr- <dig> and 93– <dig>  as expected, ssrs were less polymorphic within indica rice   and highly polymorphic between japonica rice . among  <dig> ssrs in hr- <dig>   <dig> ssrs were unique to hr- <dig> genome . these unique ssrs  were compared with sequenced genomes of other indica varieties, tetep and tadukan. out of these,  <dig> ssrs were found in both tetep and tadukan, which resulted  <dig> ssr markers unique to hr- <dig> genome. out of remaining  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> ssrs were common between hr- <dig> and tetep but absent in tadukan genome and  <dig> were common between hr- <dig> and tadukan.

the comparison of gramene ssrs in hr- <dig>  and predicted ssrs  revealed that all  <dig> public ssrs were present in predicted ssrs. elimination of publicly available ssrs in predicted ssrs of hr- <dig> yielded  <dig> ssrs to be novel from in silico prediction for indica genome. among these,  <dig> di,  <dig> tri,  <dig> tetra,  <dig> penta and  <dig> were complex ssrs. the conserved flanking regions  of  <dig> and  <dig> ssrs of hr- <dig>  were mapped to nipponbare and 93– <dig> genomes, respectively. whereas  <dig>   <dig> hr- <dig> ssrs were unique to hr- <dig> and did not map to nipponbare and 93– <dig> genomes.

genome-wide comparison of snps between hr- <dig> and 93– <dig>  hr- <dig> and nipponbare discerned higher level of polymorphism between indica-japonica comparison . these species-specific variations can be used for marker assisted breeding, positional cloning and evolutionary studies.

repeats in hr- <dig> genome
repetitive dna sequence can account for substantial portion of the many eukaryotic genomes and lead into genome expansion, gene disruption and gene duplication. total  <dig>  % repeats were found in hr- <dig> genome  as compared to nipponbare  and 93– <dig>  . total interspersed repeats were the major elements , consisting of retro-elements , dna transposons  and unclassified repeats . in case of retro-elements, long terminal repeat  had a highest fraction , followed by lines  and sines . in case of dna transposons, tourist/harbinger elements content was more , followed by tc1-is630-pogo , hobo-activator , en-spm  and mudr-is <dig> . similar trend of repeat distribution was observed in case of nipponbare and 93– <dig> genomes . chromosome-wise repeat distribution  displayed highest repeat content of  <dig>  % on chromosome  <dig> and the lowest of  <dig>  % on chromosome  <dig>  the overall distribution of retro-transposons, dna transposons and miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements  in hr- <dig> genome for chromosome  <dig> is represented in fig. 2d.

whole genome sequencing of blast susceptible and resistant indica rice varieties
we sequenced indica cultivars, which are highly resistant  and susceptible  to rice blast disease caused by ascomycetes pathogen magnaporthe oryzae . mapping of sequence reads to nipponbare genome enabled us to identify large number of variants in co- <dig> , hr- <dig> , tadukan  and tetep  . large fraction of snps and indels were found in upstream and downstream regions of annotated genes . the transition to transversion  ratio was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in co- <dig>  hr- <dig>  tetep and tadukan, respectively. the snps were located at the intervals of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nts in the genomes of co- <dig>  hr- <dig>  tetep and tadukan, respectively. similarly, the indel rate was per  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bases in co- <dig>  hr- <dig>  tetep and tadukan, respectively. one base insertions  and deletions  were more  <cit>  as compared to other types of indels .fig.  <dig> genome-wide variants identified in hr- <dig>  co- <dig>  tadukan and tetep indica cultivars. a blast symptoms,  venn diagram showing unique and shared snps and indels between and among susceptible and resistant varieties, c) genome-wide distribution of snps in co- <dig>  hr- <dig>  tadukan and tetep and d) indels distribution in co- <dig>  hr- <dig>  tadukan and tetep



among blast disease susceptible varieties ,  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels and among resistant varieties ,  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels were common . in blast susceptible varieties,  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels were unique to hr- <dig> and  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels were unique to co- <dig>  similarly in blast resistant varieties,  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels were unique to tadukan where as  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels were unique to tetep.

functional annotation of variants in blast resistant and susceptible varieties
commonly occurring variants  were annotated to know their functionality in the genome . in total,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were mutated  in susceptible and resistant varieties, respectively. we further classified these genes based on their protein domains and focused on genes involved in host defense mechanism  such as protein kinase , nucleotide-binding adapter shared by apaf- <dig>  r-proteins and ced- <dig> , and leucine-rich repeats  domains. we observed defense related genes have accumulated more mutations  in resistant varieties as compared to susceptible varieties . there were  <dig> nb-arc,  <dig> lrr,  <dig> pk genes were mutated  in resistant varieties. in susceptible varieties,  <dig> nb-arc,  <dig> lrr and  <dig> pk genes were mutated. this functional annotation of variants is highly useful to develop pcr-based functional markers  <cit>  to screen large set of rice germplasm and identify novel alleles of r genes, enabling breeders to rapid introgression of resistance genes and gene pyramiding  <cit>  to elite cultivars for durable blast resistance.table  <dig> mutation in defense related genes in indica rice varieties

mining of blast disease resistant genes in indica rice varieties
till-date,  <dig> blast resistant r-genes cloned  from several rice varieties, which confers resistance against magnaporthe isolates. to assess the spectrum of r-genes in resistant  and susceptible  cultivars, we performed protein-protein alignment of r-genes. the r-genes such as pi <dig>  pid <dig>  pid <dig>  pi <dig>  pish and pi <dig> were conserved at structure level in all indica varieties, however, several snps and indels were interrupted these genes. the pi <dig>  gene was present in tadukan and tetep but absent in co- <dig>  hr- <dig> and ir <dig>  pi-ta, a broad spectrum resistant gene was found in all four indica varieties. however, single amino acid substitution  was observed at  <dig> in pi-ta protein, which reported to be responsible for determining resistance specificity  <cit> . we observed similar ser substitution in pi-ta protein in blast susceptible varieties . in addition, we identified novel amino acid  substitution at  <dig> residues in all indica  varieties . other genes such as pib, piz-t, pik-m, pi <dig>  pi <dig>  pb <dig>  pik, pik-p and pi <dig> were absent in all indica varieties . majority of r-genes were either mutated or fragmented in case of susceptible varieties. the r genes in host and avr genes in pathogen follow gene -for -gene hypothesis  <cit> . survey of avirulent genes  in magnaporthe population isolated from hr- <dig> from southern india showed predominance of avr-pizt, avr-pita, avr-pik, avr-pii, and avr-pia . the cognate r-genes like piz-t, pi-ta, pik and pia were absent in hr- <dig>  similarly, magnaporthe isolates from co- <dig> showed presence of avr-pizt, avr-pii and avr-pik and the cognate r-genes, piz-t and pik genes were absent in co- <dig> genome. thus, study of r and avr genes in the crop ecosystems play an important role to understand the evolution of new pathotypes and to design better plant breeding strategies.fig.  <dig> structure of pi-ta gene in indica cultivars as compared to reference gene

CONCLUSIONS
high quality genomic resources are prerequisite for rice breeding. the available indica reference genomes 93– <dig> and ir <dig> were sequenced and assembled using short read sequencing technology. inherent drawbacks of short read genome assemblies may cause alignment problem during reference mapping and study of structural variations. due to non-availability of high quality indica reference genome, illumina reads from  <dig> rice accessions  were mapped to nipponbare genome to identify variants  <cit> . although another indica genome ir <dig>  <cit>  is sequenced, its chromosomes consist of complex recombination of fragments  from the genealogy of more than  <dig> parents  <cit>  including indica, japonica and wild species. with advent of third generation sequencing technology, it is possible to sequence plant genomes with higher accuracy and coverage. thus, we report improved de novo assembly of indica cultivar hr- <dig> using combinatorial approach of short and long reads which covers over 86 % of estimated genome size. the gap filling strategy with the help of long reads has improved the short read assembly with respect to genome size, repeat content, and number of protein coding genes. whole genome comparison of hr- <dig>  93– <dig> and nipponbare genomes revealed  <dig> genes and  <dig> ssrs unique to hr- <dig> genome with similar level of repeat content.

rice blast is a major biotic stress in rice, which reduces yield significantly. to understand disease resistance genes, we sequenced highly resistant  and susceptible  indica cultivars. functional annotation of snps and indels in indica cultivars showed higher non-synonymous substitutions in defense related genes  <cit>  containing nb-arc, lrr and pk domains among resistant varieties indicating strong diversifying selection to confer resistance to fast evolving blast pathogen. allele mining for resistance genes in all sequenced genomes showed presence/absence polymorphism and large number of structural variations. most of the r genes were conserved in resistant cultivars with point mutations and indels whereas loss of r-gene structure was noticed in susceptible cultivars. the broad-spectrum resistance in tadukan, tetep and ir <dig> could be attributed to presence of intact pi-ta and pi <dig> . the rice cultivars, tadukan and tetep were found to be resistant against most of blast races across the globe  <cit>  and these have been used in irri for developing ir <dig>  previously, high rate of mutation in r genes have been reported in rice   <cit>  and maize   <cit> . these allelic variations created by mutations will result in evolution of novel r genes/alleles and selection of genes that can recognize pathogen avirulence gene products. identification of r genes/alleles is a prerequisite for effective utilization of genetic and genomic resources in modern plant breeding, which is driven by new genomics tools.
