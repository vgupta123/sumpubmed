BACKGROUND
schistosomiasis is one of the most serious parasitic diseases, infecting over  <dig> million people in  <dig> tropical and subtropical countries  <cit> . the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis is mainly caused by egg-induced granuloma formation and subsequent fibrosis. however, tools for the early diagnosis and abrogation of the pathophysiological effects of the parasite, especially the eggs, are still lacking. treatment of schistosomiasis has relied on a single drug, praziquantel; however, strains of s. mansoni that are resistant to praziquantel have emerged  <cit> . understanding the parasite biology and the mechanism of the host–parasite interaction are critical for the development of an effective vaccine and anti-parasite drugs  <cit> , which are urgently needed for schistosomiasis control.

recent advances in research on the s. japonicum genome, transcriptome, and proteome have provided information that contributes to the understanding of parasite biology and the host–parasite interplay  <cit> . nucleases, including dnases, rnases, topoisomerases, recombinases, ribozymes, and rna splicing enzymes, have diverse functions ranging from dna replication, recombination and repair and rna maturation and processing to nutrient regeneration and cell death in various species  <cit> . recent evidence has highlighted a novel role of nucleases, especially dnases, in pathogen evasion of host defence mechanisms. nucleases of bacteria, such as streptococcus  <cit> , staphylococcus aureus  <cit>  and aeromonas hydrophila  <cit> , have been suggested to act as virulence factors in resistance to host neutrophil extracellular traps , while members of the dnase ii family in the roundworm trichinella spiralis have been found to be secreted into circulation to counteract host innate immune responses  <cit> . thus, disrupting the functions of vital nucleases will not only hinder the homeostasis and development of parasites but also be beneficial to the host immune system and allow parasite control. however, no nucleases have been identified and characterised in the schistosoma genus to date, except for a dicer enzyme in s. mansoni  <cit> . in this study, we first surveyed the s. japonicum genome for genes encoding potential nucleases and then analysed the transcription of these genes during different developmental stages using a dna microarray. numerous genes encoding potentially important nucleases were identified, and a novel dnase ii predominantly expressed during the mature parasite stage was systematically characterised.

RESULTS
identification and characterisation of putative nuclease sequences of s. japonicum
using known nucleases from brugia malayi, caenorhabditis briggsae, caenorhabditis elegans, hydra vulgaris, nematostella vectensis, schistosoma mansoni and trichoplax adhaerens as bait sequences,  <dig> homologous proteins encoded in the s. japonicum genome were identified. of these,  <dig> proteins were found to contain domains with potential nuclease activities. signalp <dig>  was also used to predict signal peptides. potential proteins with a d score of greater than  <dig>  were considered to have an n-terminal signal peptide sequence. among the  <dig> nucleases,  <dig> were predicted to have signal peptide sequences. the proteins were also characterised according to their substrates, enzymatic properties, and divalent cation dependencies. the catalytic activities of  <dig> nucleases were potentially divalent cation-dependent . the potential nucleases were grouped into three classes as follows:  <dig> % were classified as dnases,  <dig> % as rnases, and the remainder  possessed the potential for hydrolysing both dna and rna .table  <dig>

transcriptional analysis of genes encoding putative nucleases of s. japonicum
the transcriptional characteristics of the putative nucleases of s. japonicum were investigated using a target-specific microarray. the expression of the nucleases greatly differed among the parasites at different developmental stages  and between those of different genders , whereas few differences were observed among adult worms of the same gender isolated from different hosts . there were a total of  <dig> genes that were distinctly expressed at particular developmental stages . a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in the male or female adults from various hosts, including <dig> dnase,  <dig> nucleases and  <dig> rnases, which were up-regulated in the female adults, and  <dig> nucleases and  <dig> rnases, which were up-regulated in the male adults .figure  <dig>

the transcription of the  <dig> putative dnases was further analysed. among them, only the expression of aaw <dig>  was significantly up-regulated in the schistosomula and paired adults compared with egg and cercariae . these results were confirmed by qpcr . a phylogenetic comparison showed that these dnases were clearly divided into  <dig> major groups, including dnase i, dnase ii, exodnase iii, atp-dependent exodnase and tat dnase . aaw <dig>  was separate from the other dnases . the similarity of aaw <dig>  with known dnase ii sequences from other organisms was analysed . aaw <dig>  shared  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % identity with the dnase ii proteins of s. mansoni, human, mouse and c. elegans, respectively. the full-length cdna of aaw <dig>  contained an open reading frame of  <dig>  bp encoding  <dig> amino acids with a molecular mass of  <dig>  daltons, and it was termed sjda . sjda contained conserved amino acid residues, especially in the catalytic domain, and had a composition typical of dnaseii nucleases . it also had a classical peptide sequence at the n-terminus.figure  <dig>

characterisation of dnase activity of sjda
to confirm the endonuclease activity of sjda, a recombinant sjda-gst protein and sjda-his were generated  and tested for dna hydrolysis activity. sjda-gst could efficiently digest genomic dna from human, bovine, rabbit and murine sources, and its catalytic activity was independent of any divalent cation . sjda could also digest the genomic dna of s. japonicum . we next determined the optimum ph for its activity and found that sjda-gst activity occurred over abroad ph range and was highly active at acidic ph levels . a further assay with supercoiled plasmids as substrates showed that sjda-gst-digested products were not only short fragments but also fragments that were slightly smaller than the linear dna produced by xhoi , indicating that it may also be able to produce nicks along dna chains apart from double-strand digestion.figure  <dig>

sjda was mainly identified on surface membranes of female adult worms
to confirm sjda expression, a westernblot assay was first carried out to detect this protein in parasites at different developmental stages. a thick protein band for sjda was observed in the female adults, and a dim band was detected in the schistosomula, while no band was observed in the eggs, cercariae or male adults . these results indicated that sjda was mainly expressed in the female parasites. immunofluorescence further confirmed that this protein was mainly localised to the surfaces of the female parasites .figure  <dig>

discussion
nucleases, particularly dnases, have recently been found to play novel roles in pathogen invasion in evading host defence mechanisms. for example, the m <dig> serotype strain of group a streptococcus  has been found to express a potent dnase that is both necessary and sufficient to promote gas neutrophil resistance and virulence in a murine model of necrotising fasciitis  <cit> . the membrane-attached surface-exposed dna-entry nuclease enda of streptococcus pneumoniae has been shown to play an important role during the establishment of invasive infections by degrading extracellular chromatin and thereby overcoming the innate immune responses in mammals  <cit> . s. pyogenes nuclease a promotes bacterial survival in whole human blood and in neutrophil killing assays  <cit> . the expression of nucleases by s. aureus has also been found to lead to increased bacterial dissemination in mice  <cit> . in addition to those found in bacteria, a multitude of dnase family members have been found in t. spiralis. these dnases are believed to enhance the degradation of dna released from host phagocytes, which are involved in the down-regulation of host inflammatory processes  <cit> . in this study, we performed a genome-wide investigation to identify the nucleases of s. japonicum with potential functions in host-parasite interactions.

we identified  <dig> nucleases of 3functional classes, which all contained conserved domains of classical nucleases . the majority of these nucleases were found to be differentially expressed in eggs, cercariae or flukes , but only a few genes were differentially expressed between the schistosomulum and adult stages. this finding indicated that the schistosomula and adults have similar nucleicacid metabolic pathways. furthermore, the expression levels of the nuclease genes in adult worms of the same gender from different hosts were also similar, indicating that the parasites have evolved a capacity for adaptation to different host environments . additionally, the expression levels of nucleases were greatly increased in the female parasites compared with the male parasites , suggesting that they are critical components that are much more metabolically active in female compared with male parasites. however, it cannot be ruled out that some nucleases actively participate in the host-parasite interaction.

among all  <dig> putative nucleases, six genes encoding putative dnases were identified in the s. japonicum genome. these dnases only accounted for  <dig> % of all of the putative nucleases. aaw <dig>  , with a sequence characteristic of dnase ii, was the only dnase that showed significantly increased expression in the adult parasites . since the identification of human dnase ii in  <dig>  murine  <cit> , porcine  <cit>  and bovine  <cit>  dnase ii genes have been sequentially identified. other putative genes encoding proteins homologous to dnase ii have recently been observed in the genomes of many species, including gallus gallus , fugu rubripes , xenopus laevis , anopheles gambiae , drosophila, and the slime mould dictyostelium discoideum, in addition to parasitic organisms, such as trichinella spiralis, trichomonas vaginalis, and the bacterium burkholderia pseudomallei  <cit> . analysis of these dnase ii genes and their homologues has revealed a striking conservation of amino acid residues surrounding the catalytic site of the molecule  <cit> . the high conservation of amino acid residues in the catalytic domain of sjda in the dnase ii family  strongly indicates that its function is similar to those of other dnase ii members.

the catalytic activity of the recombinant sjda-gst protein was divalent cation-independent, and its preference for an acidic environment led to its characterisation as an endogenous dnase ii . however, it seemed to be able to introduce nicks along one strand of the dna, similar to human dnase i  <cit>  . sjda was mainly up-regulated in the schistosomula and adult parasites, but not in the cercariae or eggs, suggesting that this molecule may play a role in the adaptation of parasites to the host circulation . the expression of sjda was mainly localised to the surfaces of the adult female parasites, but it was not detected in the gut, further supporting this hypothesis . interestingly, sjda was not expressed in the male parasites . previous studies have shown that the teguments of male and female parasites are structurally different, and the surfaces of male schistosomes are coated with an increased number of sugar components compared to those of female parasites  <cit> . these findings indicate that male and female parasites possess different arsenals for the resistance of host immune expulsion.

furthermore, although sjda was primarily found on the surfaces of the female parasites, it cannot be ruled out that it is secreted by the parasite. it has been reported that trichinella spiralis constantly secretes dnase ii into the surrounding environment in the host and affects the host immune system  <cit> . we predicted the localisation of a signal peptide sequence with  <dig> amino acids to the n-terminus of sjda. this finding strongly indicates that it is secreted by the parasite. furthermore, the detection of sjda-specific antibodies in the infected host serum as early as one week after infection also suggested that it was recognised by the host immune system and played a role in the host-parasite interaction.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we discovered a novel dnase ii homologue, sjda, with a dna hydrolysis function. this protein was found to be mainly expressed on the tegument of female adult parasites, and it also stimulated early humoral immune responses after infection. sjda is likely to play an important role in the host–parasite interaction. these findings provide a novel starting point for the discovery of novel targets for drug and vaccine development against schistosomiasis.
