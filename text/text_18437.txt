BACKGROUND
the arsenal of hiv- <dig> antivirals available today includes a broad variety of drugs directed to viral targets which have a critical role at various steps of the virus life cycle. inhibitors of virus-cell attachment and fusion, reverse transcription, protease-mediated maturation cleavage of viral protein precursors, and provirus integration into the host-cell genome, can be administered in multiple types of associations to minimize the emergence of resistance in highly active antiretroviral therapies . among all the antiretroviral molecules, antibodies occupy a special position as they can inhibit hiv- <dig> replication by interfering with multiple steps of virus-cell interaction. extracellular antibodies can neutralize hiv- <dig> at the early phase of cell attachment or entry of the virus  <cit> . on the other hand, intracellular antibodies  can block virus replication by interfering with different processes, such as intracellular trafficking of incoming virions or assembly and egress of the virus progeny. the design of virus-resistant cells via intracellular expression of specific single chain fragment variable  antibodies directed to the virus has been successfully used to block hiv- <dig> replication in vitro  <cit> . the viral proteins which have been targeted by these intrabodies include structural proteins, such as the envelope glycoprotein gp <dig>  <cit>  or the matrix protein map <dig>  <cit> , the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase  <cit> , and the auxiliary proteins tat  <cit>  and vif  <cit> .

the baculovirus  autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus  is an insect virus with a large double-stranded dna genome packaged in a membrane-enveloped, rod-shaped protein capsid  <cit> . bvs have been extensively used over two decades as expression vectors for the production of recombinant proteins in insect cells  <cit> . the current interest of bvs resides in their promiscuous nature as gene transfer vectors, capable of transducing a large repertoire of established and primary cells, of both mammalian and nonmammalian origins  <cit> . recombinant bvs carrying nonviral glycoproteins fused or nonfused to their own envelope glycoprotein gp <dig> have been advantageously used in the baculovirus-display technology and its multiple biological and therapeutic applications  <cit> . for example, fusion of scfv specific for the carcinoembryonic antigen  to gp <dig> conferred to the bv vector displaying scfv-cea a targeting and binding specificity to cea-expressing cells  <cit> . however, the fusion to gp <dig> restricts the display to the poles of the virions as well as the number of copies of fusion proteins, and other strategies using fusion to vsv-g glycoprotein have therefore been proposed  <cit> .

it has been shown that the intracellular expression of a scfv derived from a monoclonal antibody  directed to a highly conserved c-terminal epitope of the hiv- <dig> map <dig> domain  <cit> , scfv/p <dig>  resulted in an efficient antiviral effect, as determined using cap24-based elisa and reverse transcription assays  <cit> . the mh-svm <dig> epitope was localised near the map17-cap <dig> junction and has been found to be accessible on recombinant gag precursor , as shown by the high level of immunoreactivity of virus-like particles  produced in sf <dig> cells and analyzed in situ by immuno-electron microscopy  <cit> . however, the exact molecular mechanism of the scfv/p17-mediated inhibitory activity has yet to be determined, since the map <dig> protein is involved in multiple viral functions within the infected cell .

the original goal of our study was to try and elucidate the mechanism of the scfv/p17-mediated inhibitory activity, and its potential use for diagnostic or therapeutic applications. insect cells infected by acmnpv expressing pr55gag  have been shown to produce vast amounts of vlp mimicking immature virions  <cit> . acmnpv-pr55gag-infected sf <dig> cells represent a convenient model for studying hiv- <dig> assembly  <cit> , coencapsidation of gag and partner proteins  <cit> , and gag processing by viral protease coexpressed in trans  <cit> . we constructed two recombinant bvs expressing scfv/p <dig> in two different formats. the n-myristoylation-competent version scfvg2/p <dig> carried a sequence which started with the n-terminal dipeptide met-gly, while the n-myristoylation-incompetent version scfve2/p <dig> started with met-glu. both scfv were incapable of blocking the assembly of vlp, or be copackaged with pr55gag into vlp. however, we found that scfve2/p <dig> was incorporated into the baculoviral envelope , and retained its anti-map <dig> functionality when displayed at the surface of bv particles. bv-e2/p <dig> represented therefore a potential biological tool for depletion of soluble map <dig> protein, or/and for competition with hiv- <dig> map <dig> receptors in in vitro or ex vivo experiments  <cit> . interestingly, we found that another scfv molecule, referred to as scfv-m6-1b <dig>  <cit>  and directed towards cd <dig> , was also displayed at the surface of baculoviral particles when fused to the same n-terminal octadecapeptide sequence from scfve2/p <dig>  abbreviated n18e <dig>  this suggested that the n-terminal octadecapeptide sequence n18e <dig> carried the bv envelope addressing function and acted as a signal peptide for bv display. the fusion of this octadecapeptide sequence to the n-terminus of scfv molecules of biological interest could be used as a general strategy for bv-display, and as an alternative to fusion to gp <dig> or vsv-g.

methods
insect cells and baculovirus infection
spodoptera frugiperda sf <dig> cells were maintained as monolayers at 28Â°c in grace's insect medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum , penicillin , and streptomycin . they were infected with one, or coinfected with two or more recombinant bvs simultaneously at a multiplicity of infection  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> pfu/cell, as previously described  <cit> .

construction of scfv against hiv- <dig> map <dig> and cd147
the hybridoma cell line mh-svm33c9/atcc hb- <dig> was obtained from the american type culture collection . the monoclonal antibody mh-svm <dig> reacts with the conserved epitope 121dtghssqvsqny <dig> at the c-terminus of the matrix protein  of hiv- <dig>  <cit> . total rna was extracted from hybridoma cells using the rneasy mini kit , and the first strand of cdna was synthesized using the oligodt- <dig> primer of the transcriptor high fidelity cdna synthesis kit . the variable regions  of heavy  and light chains  were then amplified from cdna using specific forward  and reverse  primers. fw-vhp <dig>  and rev-vhp <dig>  were used for the vh fragment, and fw-vlp <dig>  and rev-vlp <dig>  for the vl fragment. the fragment encoding the single-chain antibody to map <dig>  was constructed by overlapping pcr using fw-vhp <dig> and rev-vlp <dig> primers, both containing a sfi i site . the construction and characterization of ha-tagged scfv m6-1b <dig> directed against cd <dig> have been described in a previous study  <cit> .

recombinant bv
foreign genes were inserted into the genome of acmnpv, under the control of a chimeric acmnpv-galleria mellonella mnpv polyhedrin promoter in the case of recombinant hiv- <dig> gag polyproteins  <cit> , or under the control of the acmnpv polyhedrin promoter in the case of pbluebac <dig> -derived vectors. acmnpv-pr55gag, which expressed the n-myristoylated full-length gag polyprotein  of hiv- <dig>  has been described in detail in previous studies  <cit> . the recombinant acmnpv expressing car , the high affinity receptor for coxsackie b and adenovirus, has been described and characterized in a previous study  <cit> . bvcar virions have been shown to display the car glycoprotein at their surface  <cit> . a dna fragment coding for h6ma-ca, a non-n-myristoylated, carboxyterminal-truncated version of hiv- <dig> gag polyprotein containing the matrix  and capsid  domains with an oligo-histidine  tag at its n-terminus, was generating using the following pairs of primers: the first pair consisted of fw primers 5'-ctagcatgggtgcgagag-3' and 5'-catgggtgcgagagcg-3' and the second pair consisted of rev primers 5'-cttactacaaaactcttgctttatg-3' and 5'-gtaccttactac aaaactcttgc-3'. two pcr reactions were performed using the hiv- <dig> plasmid pnl4- <dig> as the template. the pcr products from both reactions were then mixed, denatured, and hybridized to obtain dna fragments with nhe i and kpn i cohesive ends, competent for ligation to pbluebac <dig> -his intermediate vector linearized with nhe i and kpn i. plasmid pbluebac <dig> -his was derived from pbluebac <dig>   by insertion of a sequence coding for the  tag and a gsgsas linker upstream to the nhe i site. sf <dig> cells were cotransfected with pbluebac <dig> -h6ma-ca and linearised bv dna . positive sf <dig> cells harboring recombinant bvs were isolated using the blue plaque selection method after beta-galactosidase staining. recombinant bv, abbreviated bv-h6ma-ca, was isolated using the blue plaque selection method as above. recombinant h6ma-ca protein was produced in sf <dig> cells infected with bv-h6ma-ca. sf <dig> cells were harvested at  <dig> h post infection , and h6ma-ca protein recovered from clarified sf <dig> cell lysate by affinity chromatography on ni2+-nta-agarose column , as previously described  <cit> . protein concentration in h6ma-ca samples was determined by bradford protein assay . recombinant h6ma-ca protein was used as the antigenic substrate for scfvg2/p <dig> and scfve2/p <dig> in elisa and co-immunoprecipitation experiments.

the dna fragment encoding scfv/p <dig>  obtained as described above, was cloned into the nhe i and hind iii sites of the pbluebac <dig>  plasmid. the 5' and 3' ends of scfv/p <dig> fragment in the pbluebac-scfv/p <dig> vector were then modified by oligonucleotide insertion at both nhe i and hind iii sites, to obtain two versions of the scfv/p <dig> cdna. one encoded the dipeptide met-gly at the n-terminus of scfv/p <dig>  generating the scfvg2/p <dig> clone, the other the dipeptide met-glu, generating the scfve2/p <dig> clone. at the 3' end of both clones, we inserted an oligonucleotide encoding the influenza a virus hemagglutinin epitope ypydvpdya . sf <dig> cells were then cotransfected with the resulting plasmid harboring the scfv/p <dig> coding sequence and linearised bv dna. recombinant bvs were isolated using the blue plaque selection method, as described above

the dna fragment for the ha-tagged scfv m6-1b <dig> was amplified using plasmid pcomb3x-scfv-m6-1b <dig> as the template  <cit> , with the m6-1b <dig> fw primer  encoding the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of scfve2/p <dig> , and the m6-1b <dig> rev primer . the scfv-m6-1b <dig> was then cloned into the sfi i site of sfi i-restricted pbluebac-scfve <dig>  the recombinant bv was isolated as described above, and abbreviated bv-n18e2/m <dig> 

isolation of bv particles
concentrated stocks of recombinant bv expressing scfv/p <dig> molecules, bv-scfvg2/p <dig> and bv-scfve2/p <dig>  respectively, were prepared as follows  <cit> . infected sf <dig> cell culture supernatants were harvested at  <dig> to  <dig> h post infection , and clarified by centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm and 4Â°c for  <dig> min. aliquots  of clarified culture supernatant were subjected to ultracentrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> h at 4Â°c through a 1-ml sucrose cushion  in beckman sw <dig> rotor. each baculoviral pellet was resuspended by gentle shaking in sterile phosphate-buffered saline  overnight at 4Â°c . the titers of bv suspensions ranged usually between  <dig> Ã  <dig> and  <dig> Ã  <dig> pfu/ml, as determined by plaque titration in sf <dig> cells , which corresponded to  <dig> Ã  <dig> to  <dig> Ã  <dig> bv physical particles per ml  <cit> . when needed, e.g. for electron microscopy, bv particles were further purified by isopycnic ultracentrifugation in linear sucrose-d2o gradient  <cit> . gradients  were generated from a 50% sucrose solution made in d2o buffered to ph  <dig>  with naoh, and a 30% sucrose solution made in  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig>  mm na2edta. the gradients were centrifuged for  <dig> h at  <dig>  rpm in a beckman sw <dig> rotor.  <dig>  ml-fractions were collected from the top, and proteins analyzed by sds-page and western blotting with the required antibodies. bv particles were recovered in fractions with an apparent density ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

cell fractionation and scfv purification
bv-infected sf <dig> cells were harvested between  <dig> and  <dig> h pi. after cell lysis, cellular fractionation was performed using the fractionprepâ¢ cell fractionation system . four subcellular protein fractions were thus obtained, cytosol, nucleus, membrane/particulate and cytoskeletal fractions. the scfve2/p <dig> protein was purified by affinity selection on anti-ha tag antibody affimatrix gel , following the manufacturer's instructions. each fraction eluted from the affinity gel, using elution buffer containing ha peptide  as binding competitor to displace the bound proteins, was analyzed by sds-page, and scfvg2/p <dig> or scfve2/p <dig> detected by western blotting, using anti-ha tag antibody, as described below.

gel electrophoresis, membrane transfer and antibodies
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of sds-denatured protein samples , and immunoblotting analysis have been described in detail in previous studies  <cit> . briefly, proteins were electrophoresed in sds-denaturing, 10%-polyacrylamide gel and electrically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane . blots were blocked in 5% skimmed milk in tris-buffered saline  containing  <dig> % tween- <dig> , rinsed in tbs-t, then successively incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody to influenza a virus hemagglutinin epitope ypydvpdya , or primary rabbit anti-gag antibody, followed by relevant anti-igg secondary antibodies, at working dilutions ranging from 1: <dig>  to 1: <dig> . anti-hiv- <dig> gag rabbit polyclonal antibody  was raised in rabbit by injection of bacterially-expressed, gst-fused and affinity-purified carboxyterminally truncated gag protein consisting of the full-length ma domain and the first seventy-eight residues of the ca domain . monoclonal antibody against baculoviral envelope gp <dig> glycoprotein, clone acv <dig> was purchased from santa cruz biotechnology . apparent molecular weights were estimated by comparison with prestained protein markers . for protein quantification, blots were scanned and protein bands were quantitated by densitometry, using the versadoc image analyzer and the quantity one program .

indirect elisa
the functionality of recombinant scfv/p <dig> was evaluated by their binding activity to the synthetic map <dig> peptide 121dtghssqvsqny <dig>  and h6ma-ca protein prepared as above, in standard indirect elisa procedure. in brief, aliquots  of ma p <dig> peptide solution at  <dig> Î¼g/ml, or of h6ma-ca protein solution at  <dig> Î¼g/ml in coating buffer  were incubated overnight at 4Â°c in 96-well microtiter plates . the coated wells were blocked with  <dig> Î¼l of blocking buffer  for  <dig> h at room temperature , then washed five times with washing buffer . aliquots  from clarified cellular lysates of bv-g2/p17- or bv-e2/p17-infected sf <dig> cells in blocking buffer was added to each well and incubation proceeded for  <dig> hr at rt. after five cycles of washing with tbs-t, monoclonal anti-ha tag antibody  was added at dilution 1: <dig>  in tbs-bsa, and incubated for  <dig> hr at rt. after extensive washing with tbs-t, the reaction was developed by addition of  <dig> Î¼l p-nitrophenylphosphate substrate , and od measured at  <dig> nm using an elisa plate reader at the optimum time. the antigen-binding activity of scfv-m6-1b <dig> and chimeric scfve2/m6-1b <dig> was assessed in elisa using immobilized recombinant cd147-biotin carboxyl carrier protein  fusion protein as the antigen, produced as previously described  <cit> .

competition elisa
microtiter plates  were coated with  <dig> Î¼l of  <dig> Î¼g/ml of avidin in coating buffer  and incubated overnight at 4Â°c in moist chamber. the coated wells were then blocked with  <dig> Î¼l of blocking buffer  for  <dig> h at rt, then washed four times with washing buffer .  <dig> Î¼l-aliquots of  <dig> Î¼g/ml of biotinylated-peptide  <dig>   in blocking buffer were added to each well and incubated for  <dig> h at rt. in parallel, scfve2/p <dig> purified by anti-ha tag affinity as described above was mixed with p <dig> peptide at the final peptide concentration of  <dig> Î¼g/ml, and incubated for  <dig> h at rt. after washing the wells, the mixture was added to the wells and incubated for  <dig> h at rt. bound scfve2/p <dig> was monitored by adding  <dig> Î¼l of hrp-conjugated monoclonal anti-ha tag antibody  at dilution 1: <dig>  in blocking buffer. the wells were washed four times prior to the addition of  <dig> Î¼l of  <dig> ', <dig> '-tetramethyl-benzidine  substrate. reaction was stopped by addition of  <dig> Î¼l of  <dig> n hcl, and optical densities  at  <dig> nm were measured using an elisa plate reader. the percentage of inhibition  was given by the following formula: pi = 100-, where b and bo were the od values for scfve2/p <dig> with and without inhibitor, respectively.

co-immunoprecipitation
sf <dig> cells co-infected with bv-e2/p <dig>  and bv-h6ma-ca were harvested by centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> min at 4Â°c. the cell pellets were washed  <dig> times with cold tbs, then resuspended in lysis buffer  and incubated on ice for  <dig> min. the cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> h at 4Â°c, and supernatants added to pre-washed anti-ha tag affinity gel. after incubation overnight at 4Â°c with gentle shaking, the resin was washed  <dig> times with washing buffer . immunocaptured proteins were eluted from the affinity gel by heating in sds-containing buffer  at 100Â°c for  <dig> min. the resin was pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant analyzed by sds-page and western blotting, using anti-his <dig> tag and anti-ha tag primary antibodies, both purchased from sigma.

immunofluorescence  microscopy
bv-infected sf <dig> cell monolayers were harvested at  <dig> h pi, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline  and permeabilized in  <dig> %  triton x- <dig> in pbs. cells were blocked with 3% bsa in pbs , and ha-tagged scfv/p <dig> detected by reaction with mab anti-ha  and alexa fluorÂ® 488-labeled goat anti-mouse igg antibody . for double labeling of scfv/p <dig> and gag proteins, cell samples were reacted with rabbit anti-gag antibody  and alexa fluorÂ® 546-labeled goat anti-rabbit igg . samples were treated with dapi and mounted on slides. for conventional if microscopy, images were acquired using an axiovert  <dig> inverted microscope  equiped with an axiocam video camera. for confocal microscopy, samples were analyzed using a leica tcs sp <dig> confocal microscope.

flow cytometry
scfv-expressing sf <dig> cells were resuspended in  <dig> Î¼l pbs and incubated with monoclonal anti-ha tag antibody for  <dig> h at room temperature , and at the dilution recommended by the manufacturer , then pelleted. the cell pellet was resuspended in  <dig> Î¼l pbs and reacted with alexa fluorÂ® 488-labeled goat anti-mouse igg antibody . the cell suspension was then diluted with  <dig> volumes of pbs, and analyzed by flow cytometry using a bd facscantoâ¢ ii cytometer . at least  <dig>  events were acquired for each experiment using the diva  <dig> software .

electron microscopy 
specimens were processed for em and observed as previously described  <cit> . in brief, pelleted virions of bv-e2/p <dig> and bv-g2/p <dig> were resuspended in  <dig> Î¼l-aliquots of  <dig>  m nacl,  <dig>  m tris-hcl buffer, ph  <dig> , and adsorbed onto carbon-coated formvar membrane on nickel grids. the grids were incubated with primary antibody  at a dilution of 1:  <dig> in tbs for  <dig> h at room temperature . after rinsing with tbs, the grids were post-incubated with 20-nm colloidal gold-tagged goat anti-mouse igg antibody  for  <dig> min at rt. after rinsing with tbs, the specimens were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate in h <dig> for  <dig> min at rt, rinsed again with tbs, and examined under a jem  <dig> jeol electron microscope equiped with an orius-gatan digitalized camera .

RESULTS
expression and characterization of scfvg2/p <dig> and scfve2/p <dig> molecules in recombinant bv-infected sf <dig> cells
the monoclonal antibody secreted by the mh-svm33c <dig> hybridoma cell line reacts with the highly conserved and accessible epitope 121dtghssqvsqny <dig> corresponding to the c-terminus of hiv- <dig> map <dig>  <cit> . a single chain antibody derived from mh-svm <dig>  and expressed intracellularly showed an inhibitory effect on hiv- <dig> replication and virus release  <cit> . we generated two scfv/p <dig> subclones from the mh-svm33c <dig> hybridoma cell line, scfve2/p <dig> and scfvg2/p <dig>  of which the full sequence could be communicated upon request. the n-terminal octadecapeptide sequence in scfve2/p <dig> read 1measlaaqaaqiqlvqsg <dig> , and 1mglaaqaaqiqlvqsgpe <dig> in scfvg2/p <dig>  both subclones were also modified at the c-terminus by the addition of a ha-tag, the influenza a virus hemagglutinin epitope ypydvpdya, and when inserted into the baculoviral genome, generated two recombinant bvs, bv-e2/p <dig> and bv-g2/p <dig>  respectively. the rationale for the n-terminal modification was that the dipeptide met-gly at the n-terminus of scfvg2/p <dig> represented a n-myristoylation signal which would promote the addressing scfvg2/p <dig> to the same compartment as the n-myristoylated map <dig> protein and pr55gag polyprotein. we have shown in previous studies that the met-gly signal was functional in insect cells in terms of recognition by n-myristoyl transferase, and that n-myristoylated glycine residue at the n-terminus of pr55gag is a prerequisite for plasma membrane addressing of unprocessed pr55gag, and budding and egress of membrane-enveloped vlp from sf <dig> cells  <cit> .

sf <dig> cells infected with bv-g2/p <dig> or bv-e2/p <dig> were harvested at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post infection , lysed in hypotonic buffer, and the kinetics of synthesis of scfvg2/p <dig> and scfve2/p <dig> was analyzed by sds-page and western blotting using anti-ha tag antibody. the extracellular culture medium was analyzed in parallel. we found that scfve2/p <dig> protein  was detectable as early as  <dig> h, and was maximal at  <dig> h pi. in contrast, scfvg2/p <dig> was detected at later times , and in 4- to 5-fold lower amounts, compared to scfve2/p <dig> at 48- <dig> h pi . however, both scfve2/p <dig> and scfvg2/p <dig> proteins were stable over a period of  <dig> h, with no major breakdown products detected in the western blot patterns.

cell lysates were then clarified by centrifugation, and scfvg2/p <dig> and scfve2/p <dig> were probed in soluble fraction  and insoluble pellet , respectively. we found that 15-20% of the whole recombinant scfve2/p <dig> protein synthesized was recovered as soluble material, as determined by scanning and densitometric analysis of the protein bands on blots, with a maximum at  <dig> h pi . the proportion of soluble scfvg2/p <dig> was lower , with only 8-10% of scfvg2/p <dig> protein recovered in the soluble fraction. the difference in the intracellular levels of the two recombinant proteins could not be explained by a higher level of scfvg2/p <dig> secretion, compared to scfve2/p <dig>  as no scfvg2/p <dig> protein was detected in the culture medium at any time pi. only scfve2/p <dig> protein was detectable in the extracellular medium, as described below.

cellular distribution of scfvg2/p <dig> and scfve2/p <dig> in recombinant bv-infected sf <dig> cells
we next performed cell fractionation to determine in which subcellular compartments the majority of scfve2/p <dig> and scfvg2/p <dig> proteins were localized. of note, the distinction between cytosol , membranes and organelles , nucleus  and cytoskeleton  was only operational, and did not preclude probable cross contaminations between different fractions. with this restriction in mind, scfve2/p <dig> was found to be associated with the cytosolic fraction and nuclear pellet in similar amounts , but larger quantities  were recovered in the insoluble fraction of cytoskeletal proteins . only small amounts of scfve2/p <dig> were detected in the membrane fraction . the pattern of subcellular localization was different for the scfvg2/p <dig> protein, which was undetectable in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions, but distributed unequally between membrane and cytoskeletal fractions, two-thirds and one-third of the total, respectively . thus, the n-terminal g <dig> mutation conferred two new properties to scfvg2/p <dig>  compared to its scfvg2/p <dig> counterpart,  a lower level of expression, and  a relocation to and strong association with the membranal fraction. the membrane association of scfvg2/p <dig> determined by cell fractionation was a priori consistent with the membrane targeting expected for a n-myristoylated protein.

cellular localization of scfvg2/p <dig> and scfve2/p <dig> was then studied in situ. bv-infected sf <dig> cells were harvested at  <dig> h pi and examined in immunofluorescence  microscopy or analyzed by flow cytometry using anti-ha tag antibody, with or without membrane permeabilization with detergent. fluorescent signal of scfve2/p <dig> was detected in both nonpermeabilized  and triton x100-permeabilized cells , whereas scfvg2/p <dig> fluorescence was only detectable in permeabilized cells . flow cytometry of ha tag-positive cells confirmed the accessibility of scfve2/p <dig> at the surface of nonpermeabilized cells, and the absence of significant amounts of scfvg2/p <dig> molecules at the cell surface . considering the poor recovery of scfve2/p <dig> in the membranal fraction upon cell fractionation , the results of if microcopy and flow cytometry suggested that the majority of scfve2/p <dig> molecules were addressed to the plasma membrane and highly accessible at the cell surface, but proned to dissociate from the membrane upon cell disruption and fractionation, and to relocate into the soluble fraction. in contrast, we observed a major intracellular retention of most of the scfvg2/p <dig> molecules. together with the data of cell fractionation , this suggested that scfvg2/p <dig> protein was in majority sequestered in the intracellular membrane network.

when sf <dig> cells were coinfected with two recombinant bvs to coexpress scfve2/p <dig> and n-myristoylated pr55gag, we detected no significant change in the if pattern of scfve2/p <dig>  compared to single infected cells expressing scfve2/p <dig> alone . this suggested that there was no major cellular redistribution of the scfve2/p <dig> molecules in the presence of the gag precursor. similarly, no cellular redistribution of scfvg2/p <dig> was observed when coexpressed with pr55gag .

immunological characterization of extracellular scfve2/p <dig> molecules: functionality and specificity
 antigen recognition by scfve2/p <dig> in vitro
since a significant proportion of scfve2/p <dig> molecules occurred as soluble intrabody in the cytosolic fraction, we tested lysates of bv-e2/p17-infected sf <dig> cells for the antigen binding activity of scfve2/p <dig> in elisa. two types of immobilized antigens were used: a synthetic peptide p <dig> , which reproduced the epitope sequence from hiv-1lai map <dig> , and corresponded to the immunogen used to generate mh-svm33; a recombinant h6ma-ca protein of  <dig> kda, which carried the same epitope as p <dig>  , but was embedded in the gag polyprotein. the binding data from elisa clearly showed that recombinant scfve2/p <dig> reacted with its specific epitope in both configurations , and in a dose-dependent manner . competition elisa indicated that scfve2/p <dig> bound to its epitope with a higher affinity when it was used as free p <dig>  peptide, compared to the h6ma-ca polyprotein used at equivalent epitope molarities , suggesting that scfve2/p <dig> preferentially bound to cleaved matrix protein map <dig>  compared to non processed gag precursor.

 hiv- <dig> strain-specificity of antigen recognition by scfve2/p <dig> and scfvg2/p17
although the map <dig> epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody mh-svm <dig> is highly conserved among hiv- <dig> strains, there are some subtle differences in amino acid sequence. to assess the stringency of scfve2/p <dig> towards hiv- <dig> map <dig> variants, we tested five different map <dig> peptides versus the original peptide epitope p <dig>  in competition elisa . all map <dig> peptide variants competed with p <dig>  to significant levels, considering that control homologous competition  showed a 90% binding inhibition . the lowest competition was observed for peptide p <dig> , which corresponded to the map <dig> epitope of isolate g22s <dig>  a molecular clone of hiv- <dig> isolated from haart treated aids patients  <cit> . the difference between p <dig>  and p <dig>  corresponded to an ala-val mutation at position  <dig> in the ma domain. valine carries a bulkier and more sterically hindered side chain, compared to alanine, and many examples have been reported in the literature of highly deleterious effects provoked by ala-to-val substitutions, in terms of protein conformation and function  <cit> . competition elisa was also performed using p <dig>  versus a synthetic peptide of identical composition but of inverted sequence, ynqsvqsshgtd. no competition was observed , implying that n-to-c orientation of the peptide sequence and the c-terminal position of tyrosine residue- <dig> were crucial for the recognition of the epitope by scfve2/p <dig> 

the affinity and binding specificity of scfvg2/p <dig> to the different map <dig> peptides was also tested using competition elisa, as above. since only a minor fraction of recombinant scfvg2/p <dig> protein was recovered in the soluble cytosolic fraction, clarified lysates of cells expressing scfvg2/p <dig> were concentrated by adsorption onto anti-ha tag-agarose gel, and specific elution of scfvg2/p <dig> protein was carried out using ha peptide-containing buffer. no significant difference was observed between scfvg2/p <dig> and scfve2/p <dig> in terms of reactivity with map <dig> epitope variants . the lack of difference in the antigen-binding function of soluble scfvg2/p <dig> and scfve2/p <dig> indicated that the apparent poorer solubility of scfvg2/p <dig> compared to scfve2/p <dig> was likely due to its addressing to membranal and cytoskeletal compartments, and not to major changes in its overall conformational structure and/or complementary-determining regions. this underlined the importance of the n-terminal sequence, which harboured the only difference between scfvg2/p <dig> and scfve2/p <dig> 

functionality of scfve2/p <dig> and scfvg2/p <dig> as intrabodies
 antigen binding
although our recombinant scfve2/p <dig> was active in vitro in elisa, we sought to determine whether intracellular scfve2/p <dig> molecules could bind in situ to their map <dig> epitope embedded in gag polyprotein. sf <dig> cells were co-infected with two recombinant bvs, one expressing scfve2/p <dig> , the other expressing the non-n-myristoylated gag polyprotein substrate h6ma-ca. possible antigen-intrabody complexes present in cell lysates were isolated by affinity chromatography on anti-ha tag-agarose gel. the pattern of sds-page and western blot analysis showed that most of the gag polyprotein h6ma-ca was recovered in the flow-through fraction, and that only a minor fraction bound to the column as h6ma-ca-scfve2/p <dig> complex . this suggested that scfve2/p <dig> intrabody and the non-n-myristoylated h6ma-ca protein segregated in separate cellular compartments and that only a small proportion of the scfve2/p <dig> molecules could bind to h6ma-ca. this might also suggest that scfve2/p <dig> intrabody had a relatively low affinity for its gag-embedded p <dig> epitope, compared to fully processed protein map <dig> with accessible p <dig> epitope at its c-terminus, or free c-terminal p <dig> peptide. these different hypotheses are not mutually exclusively. no detectable antigen-scfv complex was found with scfvg2/p <dig> , which confirmed that the majority of scfvg2/p <dig> accumulated in an insoluble form, and/or in a cellular compartment inaccessible to cytoplasmic gag polyprotein.

 effect of scfve2/p <dig> on vlp production
as shown earlier by if microscopy, pr55gag had no significant influence on the cellular distribution of scfve2/p <dig> protein . to further study the mechanism of hiv- <dig> antiviral effect of mh-svm33-derived scfv/p <dig>  <cit> , we investigated the possibility that scfve2/p <dig>  via its binding to map <dig>  could modify the intracellular trafficking and assembly pathway of pr55gag molecules. sf <dig> were co-infected with two recombinant bvs, one expressing the n-myristoylated pr55gag precursor, the other scfve2/p <dig>  pr55gag synthesis was analyzed in whole cell lysates, and vlp production assayed in parallel in the culture medium, as described in previous studies  <cit> . no negative effect on pr55gag protein synthesis and on vlp assembly was detected in the presence of scfve2/p <dig> . possible coencapsidation of pr55gag and scfve2/p <dig> molecules into vlp during the assembly process was also investigated. extracellular vlp were isolated from the culture medium, and their protein composition analyzed by sds-page and western blotting using anti-gag and anti-ha tag antibodies: no scfve2/p <dig> was detected in the vlp fraction . this was in contrast to the bv particle fraction, as shown below.

biophysical status of extracellular scfve2/p <dig> protein: soluble versus particulate
as mentioned above, a significant amount of scfve2/p <dig> protein was recovered in the extracellular medium of bv-e2/p17-infected sf <dig> cells. these extracellular scfve2/p <dig> molecules might occur as soluble protein, or as particle-associated material, e.g. released within membrane microvesicles or exosomes, or associated with cell debris. in order to determine the status of extracellular scfve2/p <dig> protein, samples from culture mediun were subjected to isopycnic ultracentrifugation analysis in sucrose-d2o density gradients  <cit> . gradient fractions were analyzed by sds-page and western blotting, using anti-baculoviral envelope glycoprotein gp <dig> and anti-ha tag antibodies. we found that the fractions positive for the c-terminal ha tag of scfve2/p <dig> coincided with the anti-gp64-reacting fractions, and corresponded to particulate material sedimenting with the apparent density of bv particles of the viral progeny, d =  <dig> - <dig>  . this suggested that scfve2/p <dig> was associated with the bv particles, either coencapsidated with the baculoviral proteins or inserted into the viral envelope. in the latter case, scfve2/p <dig> molecules could be exposed at the surface of the bv particles with their active site accessible for epitope binding.

immuno-em analysis of baculoviral progeny of bv-e2/p17
in order to confirm the reality of this surface exposure, samples of extracellular medium of bv-g2/p17- and bv-e2/p17-infected sf <dig> cells were analyzed by isopycnic ultracentrifugation in sucrose-d2o gradients, and fractions sedimenting at  <dig> - <dig>  were deposited on grids, immunogold labeled with anti-ha tag antibody, and observed under the electron microscope. bv-g2/p <dig> virions were never seen associated with gold grains, and most immunogold labeling was found at distance from bv particles, and corresponded to nonspecific, background labeling . the absence of anti-ha labeling of bv-g2/p <dig> virions in immuno-em was consistent with the absence of detectable scfvg2/p <dig> protein in the extracellular medium, as mentioned above. under the same experimental conditions however, anti-ha tag immunogold labeling was found to be associated with virions of bv-e2/p <dig> . the immuno-em analysis therefore confirmed that scfve2/p <dig> molecules were truely incorporated into the baculoviral envelope. such incorporation of foreign proteins into the baculoviral envelope has already been described with human membrane glycoprotein car  <cit> .

immunological functionality and topology of scfve2/p <dig> displayed on the baculoviral envelope
the observation that bv-displayed scfve2/p <dig> was accessible to anti-ha tag antibodies in immuno-em analysis strongly suggested that the c-terminal ha tag was oriented outwards. this orientation was already suggested by if microscopy of intact cells expressing scfve2/p <dig> . the next experiments were designed to assess the topological orientation of the scfve2/p <dig> molecule in the baculoviral envelope, and, more importantly, to determine the degree of accessibility of its antigen-binding regions. bv-e2/p <dig> virions were immobilized on elisa plate and probed with anti-ha tag antibody. the positive reaction indicated that the carboxyterminal region of scfve2/p <dig> was exposed at the surface of the virions , and that the insertion of scfve2/p <dig> in the baculoviral envelope mimicked the orientation of class ii membrane glycoproteins, with the aminoterminal region anchored in the baculoviral envelope, as depicted in figure 7b.

the antigen binding activity of bv-displayed scfve2/p <dig> was then determined by elisa, using immobilized h6ma-ca protein or synthetic peptide p <dig> . in this assay, bv-e2/p <dig> virions displaying scfve2/p <dig> were used as the equivalent of primary antibodies, and bound virions were detected using monoclonal antibody directed towards the baculoviral glycoprotein gp <dig>  both h6ma-ca protein and p <dig>  peptide were recognized by bv-e2/p <dig> virions , which indicated that the bv-displayed scfve2/p <dig> molecules retained their antigen-binding capacity.

bv-display of ha-tagged anti-cd <dig> scfv-m6-1b9
scfv expressed in recombinant bv-infected insect cells are not naturally or spontaneously addressed to the baculoviral envelope, and different methods have been developed to obtain baculoviral envelope insertion of various scfv molecules, including fusion to gp <dig> or to vsv-g stem  <cit> . although scfve2/p <dig> did not contain any consensus signal peptide for membrane addressing, we postulated that in sf <dig> cells, the n-terminal octadecapeptide sequence 1measlaaqaaqiqlvqsg <dig> , was responsible for the intracellular trafficking and targeting of scfve2/p <dig> to the site of bv budding, where it became inserted into the baculoviral envelope. to test this hypothesis, n18e <dig> was fused to the n-terminus of a non-related scfv, the ha-tagged scfv-m6-1b <dig>  which recognizes the membrane glycoprotein cd <dig>  <cit> . when expressed in hela or  <dig> cells, scfv-m6-1b <dig> occurred as an active anti-cd <dig> intrabody, provoking the intracellular retention of cd <dig> and the blockage of its surface expression  <cit> . our resulting chimeric scfv construct, abbreviated scfv-n18e2/m <dig>  was expressed in sf <dig> cells using a recombinant bv vector . scfv-n18e2/m <dig> molecules were detected in significant levels at the surface of nonpermeabilized cells harvested at  <dig> h pi, as for scfve2/p <dig> . the baculoviral progeny from bv-n18e2/m6-infected cells was then isolated by ultracentrifugation and analyzed by elisa  and immuno-em  using anti-ha tag antibody. both methods showed the accessibility of the ha tag at the surface of bv particles. in the electron micrograph shown in figure 8d, two baculovirus particles were seen as a v-shape dimer pointing to one gold grain. this might represent the cross-linking of two particles via the two fab domains of a single antibody molecule, although it could not be excluded that one antibody would bind to one particle, while the other would be in close proximity.

we also tested the antigen-binding capability of bv-displayed chimeric scfv-n18e2/m <dig>  using the recombinant cd147-bccp fusion protein as immobilized antigen in elisa, as previously described  <cit> . the data showed that the chimeric scfv-n18e2/m <dig> molecules present at the surface of bv particles conserved their antigen-binding function and their specificity towards cd <dig> . these results suggested that the fusion of the n18e <dig> peptide to scfv-m6-1b <dig> was able to confer to the chimeric scfv-n18e2/m <dig> protein the capacity to be addressed to the bv budding sites at the plasma membrane and to be incorporated into the baculoviral envelope. they also suggested that n18e <dig> could function as a universal n-terminal signal peptide for bv-display of functional scfv of biological interest. a scheme of the general strategy of stepwise construction of bv particles displaying scfv molecules of interest equiped with our signal octadecapeptide n18e <dig> is presented in figure  <dig> 

discussion
despite several recent studies, little information is available at the molecular level on the molecular factors and mechanisms involved in the secretory pathway of insect cells in general, and the lepidopterian sf <dig> cells in particular  <cit> . secreted recombinant proteins are usually obtained by fusion of the protein of interest to the n-terminal leader peptide of the honeybee pro-mellitin   <cit> . however, this strategy does not always guarantee the secretion of the recombinant protein. for example, scscr <dig>  a mbm-sp-leaded scfv derived from an anti-african cassava mosaic virus monoclonal antibody  <cit>  was not secreted in the culture medium of bv-infected insect cell lines from spodoptera frugiperda, trichoplusia ni, and mamestra brassicae. however, scscr <dig> molecules were released at high levels in the culture medum of drosophila cell lines stably expressing mbm-sp-fused scscr <dig>  <cit> . likewise, certain types of scfv expressed in insect cells using recombinant bv have been recovered in the extracellular medium although they lack an insect cell leader peptide  <cit> . the most probable explanation was that specific features of recombinant scfv, such as their own n-terminal amino acid sequence or/and other downstream domain, can influence their behaviour in bv-infected cells.

bv-display has been used for almost a decade for immunisation purposes, gene delivery, or development of eukaryotic libraries  <cit> . conventional bv-display involves baculoviral envelope glycoprotein gp <dig> manipulations  <cit> , or the use of the vsv-g stem  <cit> . this differs from the incorporation of foreign proteins or glycoproteins into the baculoviral envelope without fusion to gp <dig>  such as the envelope incorporation and display of functional human beta- <dig> adrenergic receptor  described in an earlier study  <cit> . in a more recent work, we demonstrated the incorporation of the human car glycoprotein into the baculoviral envelope. car is the high affinity receptor for adenovirus serotype  <dig>  and is a resident glycoprotein of the human cell plasma membrane. the baculoviral envelope-incorporated car was fully functional at the surface of bvcar virions, and enabled the formation of bvcar-ad <dig> complexes, mediated by the interaction between the adenoviral fiber and car. we have used this strategy of bvcar-ad <dig> duo formation to transduce ad5-refactory cells  <cit> .

it was relatively easy to conceive that human Ã2ar and car molecules, even though expressed in heterologous system, could be displayed on the baculoviral envelope since both are resident membrane glycoproteins. it was rather unexpected for scfve2/p <dig>  which was an artificial molecule extrinsic to the bv-insect cell system. moreover, in the case of scfve2/p <dig>  the scfv molecule was not constructed for membrane targeting, in contrast to scfvg2/p <dig> which carried the specific met-gly dipeptide signal for n-myristoylation by n-myristoyl-transferases. comparison of the amino acid sequences of scfve2/p <dig> and scfvg2/p <dig>  which both lacked any consensus leader peptide, showed that they only differed by three residues at their n-terminus, ml for scfve2/p <dig>  versus ml for scfvg2/p <dig>  the results of these minor sequence changes were drastic in terms of scfv solubility, cell compartmentalization and extracellular release. recombinant scfvg2/p <dig> protein expressed in sf <dig> cells was inexploitable since it was insoluble and trapped in the membrane pellet.

recombinant scfve2/p <dig> however was recovered simultaneously under two different forms:  as soluble scfv molecules from lysates of bv-infected sf <dig> cells, and  as bv-displayed scfv in the culture medium of the bv-infected sf <dig> cell cultures. both forms could be used as biological tools for different purposes. soluble scfve2/p <dig> could serve in conventional diagnostic assays for hiv- <dig> gag detection, through specific recognition of the conserved map <dig> epitope. map <dig> functions as a structural component of hiv- <dig> virions, but also as a viral cytokine which binds to a cellular receptor, p17r  <cit> , when released by hiv-infected cells. in the case of bv-displayed scfve2/p <dig>  the potential applications would be different. for example, if one considers the virokine properties of soluble map <dig> and the importance of inflammatory response at the mucosal sites of hiv- <dig> entry  <cit> , one could envisage to use pelletable, bv-displayed scfve2/p <dig> in experimental models of infected mucosae to deplete soluble map <dig> from the extracellular medium, or/and to compete with map <dig> for binding to p17r.

to assess the role of the n-terminal domain of scfve2/p <dig> in the process of membrane addressing and scfv display on the baculoviral envelope, we fused the n-terminal octadecapeptide 1measlaaqaaqiqlvqsg <dig>  to another bioactive scfv molecule, scfv-m6-1b <dig>  the ligand of scfv-m6-1b <dig> is m <dig>  also called cd <dig>  <cit> , a transmembrane glycoprotein highly expressed in various types of malignant cells  <cit>  and tumors, e.g. nasopharyngeal carcinoma  <cit> . cd <dig> acts as an inducer of extracellular matrix metalloproteinases  to promote tumor growth, invasion, metastasis and neoangiogenesis, and is a prognostic marker for invasiveness in prostate cancer  <cit>  and thyroid carcinoma  <cit> . cd <dig> is also involved in atherosclerosis plaque instability  <cit>  and in the regulatory inhibition of starvation-induced autophagy in human hepatoma cells  <cit> .

we expressed the chimeric scfv-n18e2/m <dig> molecule in recombinant bv-infected sf <dig> cells, and found that the bv progeny displayed scfv-n18e2/m <dig> on the baculoviral envelope. this suggested that the n-terminal octadecapeptide n18e <dig> carried the function required for bv-display of scfv molecules, and could be considered as a bv envelope addressing/anchoring signal peptide. this was further supported by the comparison of the structural domains of scfv downstream of the n18e <dig> peptide: scfv-n18e2/m <dig> and scfve2/p <dig> differed by the successive order of their variable regions, vl-linker-vh from the n- to c-terminus in scfv-m6-1b <dig>  versus vh-linker-vl in scfve2/p <dig>  this implied that the nature of the variable region downstream of n18e <dig> had little influence, if any, on the membrane addressing of chimeric, n18e2-fused scfv.

although the molecular mechanism of cell trafficking of our chimeric scfv-n18e2/m <dig> molecule still remained to be elucidated in molecular terms, our present data provided a novel concept and platform for engineering scfv molecules competent for bv-display.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we identified a n-terminal octadecameric peptide sequence, n18e <dig>  which mediated the plasma membrane addressing and anchoring of scfv into the baculoviral envelope, and acted as a bv-envelope display signal. n18e <dig> could therefore be used in a general technology for bv-display of bioactive molecules such as scfv. in previous studies, we provided evidence that scfv-m6-1b <dig> was biologically active as an intrabody, and could be used to diminish the expression of cd <dig> at the surface of human cells  <cit> . the data presented here showed that scfv-m6-1b <dig> was also functional when displayed on the bv vector envelope. one might therefore envisage to use scfv-n18e2/m6-displaying bv particles as cd147-targeted vectors in future protocols of cancer biotherapy, to transfer therapeutic genes  to cd147-overexpressing malignant cells. since the baculoviral envelope glycoprotein gp <dig> is a low specificity attachment protein which allows bv to enter a wide variety of cells originating from mammalian or nonmammalian species  <cit> , it will be necessary to block the gp <dig> binding activity of such vectors, and/or place the desired therapeutic gene under the control of a tumor-specific promoter, in order to avoid any bystander effect on cells of the surrounding tissues.
