BACKGROUND
plant cell walls rich in polysaccharides are important targets for the food, fiber and fuel industries. both primary and secondary cell walls consist of a complex network of cellulose microfibrils connected to two different groups of polysaccharides, hemicelluloses and pectins, which together with a lesser amount of glycoproteins and phenolic substances interact to form the plant extracellular matrix. polysaccharide content varies largely in concentration, type and structure between different plant species, tissues and during the stages of plant development. less invasive methods that enable analysis of plant components without destroying the network are sought as they can be used not only to detect the presence of individual polysaccharides and their microdistribution across cell walls but can also reveal the organization and interactions between different matrix-components thus helping to understand their function. this is possible with molecular probes that specifically detect polysaccharides in plant sections  <cit> .

to date, antibodies dominate the field of molecular probes but some challenges need still to be overcome. attempts to produce antibodies by conventional immunization strategies that recognize carbohydrates are often hampered by the low immunogenicity/antigenicity of these macromolecules. furthermore, antibodies in their native form are unstable under certain conditions like elevated temperatures, and they have a large size that limits their penetration into samples and restricts their use in some applications. these limitations have led to the development and use of techniques that are independent of immunization  <cit>  and to approaches using stabilized protein variants  <cit> . furthermore, alternative scaffolds  <cit>  that are stable enough to withstand the modulation of their molecular surface by molecular engineering  <cit>  are used as alternatives to antibodies and antibody fragments to select specific binders from large molecular libraries. carbohydrate-binding module  4- <dig> from xylanase 10a of rhodothermus marinus is one such scaffold from which a combinatorial library has been constructed through mutagenesis of twelve amino acids in the carbohydrate-binding cleft  <cit> . from this library, binders with novel engineered specificities targeting carbohydrates have been selected proving the evolutionary capacity of this scaffold.

in this study we further investigated cbm4- <dig> as a diversity-carrying scaffold and explored the potential of selected variants to undergo further evolution in vitro to perfect their binding properties and their usefulness as molecular probes. random mutagenesis is a powerful tool that can be used to create diversity from which mutants with improved binding can be selected in a manner similar to that exploited by the immune system for adjusting antibody affinity and/or specificity against a given antigen. here we target the plant polysaccharide xyloglucan. during plant growth, the primary cell wall has a crucial role by providing mechanical support while allowing cell growth and expansion. of the hemicelluloses present in primary cell walls, xyloglucan is the most abundant in dicotyledons and non-graminaceous monocotyledons. it is built up by a cellulose-like β1- <dig> glucan backbone that may be substituted up to 75% with xylose units. the xyloses in turn can be decorated with galactose and fucose units, in the latter case generating so-called fucosylated xyloglucan . many questions still remain to be answered regarding the role of xyloglucan. it is known that xyloglucan structure varies slightly in different plant species  <cit>  but its exact composition for all species is unknown. also the role and necessity of xyloglucan during development of the cellulose-xyloglucan network in primary cell walls is currently under debate  <cit> . moreover, recent studies suggest that xyloglucan may play an important role in the bending of hardwood tree by creating tensile stress in the gelatinous g-layer found in the tension wood  <cit> . molecular probes specific for xyloglucan could help to address these questions in detail.

to date, there exist two types of xyloglucan detecting probes, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies  <cit> , and xyloglucan-binding modules  created by cbm engineering  <cit> . in this study, designed to evaluate the evolutionary potential of cbm by exposing a xgbm to random mutagenesis and selection, we have generated additional xyloglucan binding probes. the new xgbm have higher affinity for xyloglucan compared to our earlier reported xgbm and these bind, in contrast to other xyloglucan detecting probes, to xyloglucan regions that are galactose-decorated, thereby extending the limited set of xyloglucan-specific binders and their usefulness in applications such as studies of plant cell wall organization.

methods
carbohydrates
non-fucosylated xyloglucan derived from seeds of tamarindus indica, laminarin, lichenan and galactose were derived from megazyme  while birchwood xylan was purchased from sigma-aldrich . biotinylated xyloglucan was prepared as previously described  <cit> . biotinylated fucosylated xyloglucan was prepared from fucosylated xyloglucan derived from rubus fructicosus , as previously described  <cit> .

library construction
the gene encoding xg- <dig> , a xgbm previously described  <cit> , was used as starting material when creating two xyloglucan focused cbm libraries . mutations were randomly introduced by using the pcr-based genemorph ii random mutagenisis kit from stratagene  and following the manufacture's instructions for achieving a mutation ratio of 1%. in a first round of mutations xg- <dig> was used as template gene to create lib <dig>  which in turn was submitted to a second round of mutations to create lib <dig>  both pcr-products were purified  using a commercial kit , digested with sfii and noti  and purified again before cloning between sfii/noti sites of a modified version of the pfab5c.his  <cit>  phagemid vector. the ligated products were transformed into electrocompetent escherichia coli top10f'  that were grown on luria-bertani  agar plates  containing selective antibiotics  glucose). the cultivated cells were gathered and stored at -80°c in 15% glycerol and colonies selected at random for sequence-analysis to determine the diversity of each library.

phage stocks were produced by infecting cultures of the bacteria harbouring the library grown in 2× yeast tryptone  media containing  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin,  <dig> μg/ml tetracycline and 1%  glucose at exponential growth phase with vscm <dig> helper phage  at a multiplicity of infection of 20: <dig> during  <dig> min at 37°c without shaking. the growth medium was changed and the glucose was replaced by  <dig>  mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside  and  <dig> μg/ml kanamycin and production of phage particles was allowed to proceed over night at 30°c with shaking. finally the phages were precipitated by incubation on ice of filtered supernatants with  <dig>  volumes 20% peg6000/ <dig>  m nacl followed by centrifugation . the pellets were dissolved in pbs containing  <dig> % bsa  in a tenth of the original culture volume and stored at 8°c.

phage display selection
selections were performed in three rounds using streptavidin-coated paramagnetic dynabeads . every selection round was preceded by an incubation step, in which phages that bind non-specifically to the beads or that recognize the major substrate, i.e. xylan, of cbm4- <dig> were removed. in short,  <dig> μl of library phage-stocks were incubated in selection buffer  with  <dig> μl streptavidin-coated dynabeads, i.e. beads without xyloglucan, and  <dig> μl xylan . the beads were removed using a magnetic holder and the remaining supernatant was used for selections. in a parallel step dynabeads were coated with biotin-conjugated xyloglucan. different amounts of beads and xyloglucan were used in the different rounds of selection. in the first round  <dig> μl beads were coated with  <dig> μg biotin-labelled xyloglucan for  <dig> minutes before excess xyloglucan was removed by washing. the washed xyloglucan-coated beads were mixed with the supernatants from the preincubation step and left for incubation during  <dig> hours on an end-to-end rotor. next, unbound phages were removed by washing four times with selection buffer and then twice with pbs. the bound phages were eluted by digestion with  <dig> μl of  <dig>  mg/ml trypsin during  <dig> min after which the reaction was stopped by addition of  <dig> μl of  <dig>  mg/ml aprotinin. finally the eluted phages were rescued by infecting them into e. coli top10f' at exponential growth phase during  <dig> min at 37°c. bacteria were spread on selective media  glucose) and grown over night at 37°c. the second round of selections differed by reduction of the amount of ligand to  <dig> μl dynabeads coated with  <dig>  μg xyloglucan. in the third round of selections two different strategies were used. first, after preincubation of phage stocks with streptavidin-coated dynabeads and soluble xylan,  <dig>  μg biotin-xyloglucan was added to the phage stock. after a  <dig> minutes incubation at room temperature,  <dig> μl streptavidin-coated dynabeads were added with or without concomitant addition of soluble xyloglucan  as a competitor. the third round of selections generated four pools of phages  from which  <dig> colonies  were picked at random and analyzed by phage elisa and by sequencing. isolated clones were named xg- <dig> followed by an arabic number to define its library origin  and a roman numeral to define the clone number  or without  added soluble xyloglucan during the final stages in the third round of selection).

phage elisa
binding of phage-displayed cbm towards xyloglucan and xylan was studied by elisa. 96-well microtitre plates  were coated over night with strepavidin  or xylan . biotinylated xyloglucan  was added onto the streptavidin-coated plates. phage stocks diluted in selection buffer were added to the plates in duplicates. after incubation for  <dig> hours at 37°c unbound phages were washed off and bound phages were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-m <dig> antibody  diluted in blocking buffer. the plates were analyzed with o-phenylenediamine as chromogen whose development was quantified using an emax spectrophotometer  at  <dig> nm, once the reaction had been stopped with h2so <dig>  in primary screening of clones, those that gave an absorbance >  <dig>  against xyloglucan were considered to display xgbm.

sequence analysis
sequencing was performed by eurofins mwg operon  using plasmids purified from over night cultures using qiaamp dna mini kit  as the sequencing template. gene sequences have been deposited in genbank . a structure model of xg-34/i-x was obtained using the cphmodels  <dig>  homology-modelling server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/cphmodels/ using the structure of cbm4- <dig>  as template, as described by cicortas gunnarsson et al  <cit> .

site-directed mutagenesis
single mutations in the xg- <dig> and xg-34/2-vi genes were introduced using quickchange ii site-directed mutagenesis kit  according to the manufacturer's protocol with one exception. instead of using nzy broth when recovering transformed e. coli xl1-blue cells 2yt was used. to mutate xg- <dig> aspartate at position  <dig> into glutamate, primers 5'-gaatcagtcgcatgatgaatacgggagactgcatg-3'  and 5'-catgcagtctcccgtattcatcatgcgactgattc-3'  were used. in the same way a primer-pair consisting of 5'-gaatcagtcgcatgatgattacgggagactgcatg-3'  and 5'-catgcagtctcccgtaatcatcatgcgactgattc-3'  were used for mutation of the same residue  from glutamate to aspartate in xg-34/2-vi. primers were obtained from eurofins mwg operon.

protein production
production of soluble cbm was performed using the t <dig> expression-system consisting of the pet22b vector  harboured in e. coli bl <dig> . restriction-sites were introduced before and after cbm-encoding genes with the help of pcr according to cicortas gunnarsson et al  <cit> . digestion of purified pcr-products and pet22b with ndei and xhoi  enabled cloning of the genes in-between ndei/xhoi sites in the vector resulting in constructs encoding recombinant proteins containing a hexahistidine tag. the ligated products were transformed into chemically competent e. coli bl <dig>  from which production of recombinant cbm was controlled with glucose/iptg. cbm-producing bacteria were cultured in 2yt media containing ampicillin  to exponential phase  before protein-production was induced by addition of iptg  and allowed to proceed for  <dig> hours at 37°c. cells were harvested by centrifugation , washed with cold  <dig> % nacl and resuspended in  <dig> mm nah2po4/ <dig>  m nacl, ph  <dig> . cell-lysates were centrifugated  after sonication ) and the cbm were finally purified on columns containing ni-nta  using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. the concentration of purified cbm was determined spectrophotometrically from absorbance measurements at  <dig> nm using extinction coefficients individually calculated for each cbm using the protparam software  <cit>  available at http://www.expasy.org.

binding analysis
affinity electrophoresis  was done using polyacrylamide gels containing different carbohydrates. the gels used for separation were cast from carbohydrate-solutions containing  <dig> % acrylamide/bisacrylamide  in  <dig>  m tris, ph  <dig> . on top of each separation gel a stacking gel ,  <dig>  m tris, ph  <dig> ) was cast. all gels were run using the bio-rad  mini-gel system at room temperature at  <dig> v in running buffer . the migration speed of native soluble cbm was performed using  <dig> μg protein per lane. the carbohydrates embedded in the gels were xyloglucan , birchwood xylan , laminarin  and lichenan . the proteins were visualized by simplyblue-staining . a standard kaleidoscopic protein-ladder  was included in the analysis as well as two earlier described cbm that served as controls, x- <dig>  <cit>  that recognizes xylan but not xyloglucan, and g- <dig>  <cit>  that does not bind to carbohydrates.

competitive elisa was performed to study how binding of cbm to immobilized xyloglucan was inhibited by pre-incubation with  xyloglucan and fucosylated xyloglucan. the inhibitory concentration required to reduce the signal by 50%  for the different variants was calculated. flat-bottom 96-well plates  were coated with  <dig> μl  <dig> nm xyloglucan over night at 4°c. xg- <dig> and its evolved variants were incubated with different concentrations of xyloglucan or fucosylated xyloglucan dissolved in pbs, 1% bsa,  <dig> % tween  <dig> during  <dig> hour at 37°c prior to transfer of the cbm-carbohydrate solutions to the xyloglucan-coated plates. detection of cbm bound to immobilized xyloglucan was achieved by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-his <dig> antibody . development of the plates was done as described above for phage elisa.

isothermal titration calorimetry  measurements were performed at 25°c following standard procedures  <cit>  using a microcal omega titration calorimeter . xxxg and xllg  were prepared as previously described  <cit> . prior to analysis, the cbm were extensively dialyzed against  <dig> mm hepes, ph  <dig>  containing  <dig> mm cacl <dig>  the same buffer was used to dissolve tamarind seed xyloglucan, xxxg, xllg and galactose to minimize heats of dilution.  <dig> μm protein samples were stirred at  <dig> rpm in a  <dig>  ml reaction cell. ligands were injected as a single  <dig> μl aliquot followed by  <dig> successive  <dig> μl aliquots at  <dig> s intervals . integrated heat effects were analyzed by non-linear regression using a single-site binding model.

plant tissue labelling with cbm and antibodies
dry tamarind seeds were scarified and left overnight in water at room temperature . the next day, swollen seeds were shelled and cut into ca  <dig> μm sections using a leitz microtome  microtome. all labelling experiments were thereafter performed three times with sections placed in eppendorf tubes. in order to prevent non-specific binding of cbm, sections were treated with a blocking solution containing 5%  ovalbumin in  <dig> mm sodium phosphate buffer  for  <dig> h at rt followed by washing  in the same buffer. tamarind sections were incubated with fitc-conjugated  <cit>  cbm at  <dig> - <dig> μm for  <dig> and  <dig> h  and overnight . thereafter samples were washed three times with buffer . additional sections were labelled with fucosylated xyloglucan-specific fitc-conjugated cbm fxg-14b  at a concentration of  <dig> μm in  <dig> mm sodium phosphate buffer  using the same labelling protocol.

blocked tamarind sections were also incubated with monoclonal antibody ccrc-m <dig>  <cit>  at a 1: <dig> dilution in  <dig> mm sodium phosphate buffer  supplemented with 1% ovalbumin overnight . after washing , samples were labelled with fitc-conjugated anti-mouse antibody  at a 1: <dig> dilution for  <dig> h at rt and washed with water.

fluorescent microscopy
samples were placed on object glasses mounted in fluorsave , covered by coverslips and examined by fluorescent microscopy using a standard set of filters for fitc. all images were obtained using a leica dc300f ccd camera and digital imaging system for professional microscopy  at equal settings .

RESULTS
library construction
we have previously reported on the molecular engineering of xyloglucan-specific binders using the scaffold of a carbohydrate-binding module cbm4- <dig> from the xylanase 10a of r. marinus. in this study we show that it is possible to evolve  the functionality of binders based on this scaffold as exemplified by one such module, xg- <dig> specific for non-fucosylated xyloglucan  <cit>  while preserving its specificity for xyloglucan. through random mutagenesis, two libraries  each consisting of 1- <dig> ×  <dig> clones were created by cloning of mutated genes in a modified version of the pfab5c.his phagemid vector  <cit>  that is suited for use in phage display selection approaches. sequencing of  <dig> clones randomly selected from each library revealed that 60% and 35% respectively, of members of lib <dig> and lib <dig> had inserts, out of which approximately 86% and 54% respectively, were in-frame. the frequency of base pair substitutions was  <dig> - <dig> %.

selection and primary screening
the combinatorial libraries were used separately for selection of tight xyloglucan-binding clones by phage display. three rounds of selections were performed in the presence of xylan using biotinylated xyloglucan bound to streptavidin-coated dynabeads as the target. the selection pressure was increased in two subsequent rounds of selection by decreasing the amount of biotinylated xyloglucan. in the last round of selection preformed biotinylated xyloglucan-phage-complexes were caught on streptavidin coated paramagnetic beads in the presence or absence of soluble xyloglucan in an attempt to vary the degree of selection stringency further. the selection system generated two pools of clones for each library. from each pool,  <dig> clones were randomly picked and analyzed with phage-elisa using xylan or xyloglucan as target. of these  <dig> clones,  <dig> bound xyloglucan. among these, the six clones that bound best to xyloglucan in comparison to xg- <dig> and only showed low binding to xylan were selected. subsequent analysis of the ability of soluble xyloglucan to inhibit the binding of these xgbm displayed on phage to immobilized xyloglucan, identified three clones with improved properties . these variants, xg-34/1-x  and xg-34/2-i and xg-34/2-vi , were all identified from the selections in which soluble xyloglucan had been incorporated in the final stages of the third round of selection.

affinity and specificity
the binding characteristics of the three variants of xg- <dig> in soluble form were analyzed by ae. retardation in xyloglucan-containing gels was considerably higher for two of the evolvants, xg-34/1-x and xg-34/2-vi, than for xg- <dig> indicating improved affinity for these modules. the third mutant, xg-34/2-i behaved similar to xg- <dig>  to assess the specificity of the new clones we performed ae-studies with laminarin, lichenan and different concentrations of xylan. none of the novel clones bound to any of these substrates demonstrating that polyreactive binding properties had not developed as a consequence of the affinity maturation process .

binding affinities exhibited by xg- <dig>  xg-34/1-x and xg-34/2-vi towards xyloglucan and the component oligosacharides xxxg  and xllg   were determined by itc. for xg- <dig>  binding was clearly detectable but too low to be precisely quantified. in contrast, the evolvants xg-34/1-x and xg-34/2-vi bound well to xllg in an enthalpy-driven interaction, with affinities in the ka =  <dig> m- <dig> range, but not to the non-galactosylated oligosaccharide xxxg . these modules also bound notably stronger to xyloglucan than xg- <dig>  however still below the limits of precise quantification by itc. the fact that these modules bind well to xllg but not to xxxg suggests that the galactose decorations of the xyloglucan polymer play an important role in the binding of the module to the ligand. further itc experiments showed that neither xg-34/1-x nor xg-34/2-vi bind to galactose monosaccharides, strongly suggesting that a more specific, ordered pattern of the galactose decorations provide a necessary motif for proper ligand recognition and binding.

*thermodynamic parameters for some interactions could not be fully characterized due to relatively low affinity, limited solubility of protein and limited availability of ligand. in those cases n was fixed to  <dig> for data fitting and calculation of ka.

§calculated number of binding sites on the protein

to further define the specificity of the two tight-binding mutants we investigated if these possessed, like xg- <dig>  the ability to discriminate xyloglucan from its fucosylated form. competition elisa was performed by inhibiting binding of xg-34/1-x and xg-34/2-vi to biotinylated xyloglucan on plates by preincubation with different concentrations of soluble  xyloglucan or fucosylated xyloglucan. xg-34/1-x and xg-34/2-vi were efficiently inhibited from binding immobilized xyloglucan by addition of soluble xyloglucan with an ic50-value of  <dig> ng/ml and  <dig> ng/ml, respectively. to achieve the same degree of inhibition approximately 30-fold more fucosylated xyloglucan was needed , revealing that the ability of xg- <dig> to discriminate between these forms of xyloglucan had been retained during the affinity maturation process.

sequence analysis
sequencing revealed that xg-34/1-x, xg-34/2-i and xg-34/2-vi carried 2- <dig> substitutions at the amino acid level in comparison to xg- <dig>  they had one mutation in common, a substitution of aspartate in position  <dig> to glutamate . this substitution reverses a mutation of xg- <dig> to the residue found in cbm4- <dig> . besides this mutation xg-34/1-x and xg-34/2-vi, the two tight-binding clones, had only one other mutation each, both of which were located in two adjacent loops far away from the carbohydrate binding-site. the number of substitutions found in the third clone, xg-34/2-i was greater as it had incorporated  <dig> altered residues .

mutagenesis of residue 112
to evaluate the significance of glutamate in position  <dig>  a glu <dig> → asp mutant of xg-34/2-vi and an asp <dig> → glu mutant of xg- <dig> were produced. affinity electrophoresis demonstrated that xgbm containing glutamate in position  <dig> i.e. xg-34/2-vi and xg- <dig> d112e, bound xyloglucan with high affinity. in contrast, proteins having an aspartate in position  <dig>  bound xyloglucan with low affinity . thus, the glutamate in position  <dig> alone is responsible for the increased apparent affinity of xg-34/2-vi for xyloglucan and it is likely to have a significant effect on the affinity of xg-34/1-x and xg-34/2-i as well. as none of these proteins with aspartate or glutamate in this position, in contrast to cbm4- <dig>  show any binding to xylan, it appears that other common differences  in the sequence of xg- <dig> and its mutants in comparison to cbm4- <dig> are likely to contribute to this binding character. thus, these other modifications provide the framework in which glu <dig> is able to mediate specific high affinity binding to xyloglucan.

detection of xyloglucan in tamarind seeds
an improvement in binding to a target of interest can potentially translate into improved performance of the probe in various applications. we explored how these xyloglucan-specific variants derived from the cbm4- <dig> scaffold behaved in the staining of endosperm of tamarind seeds, a source rich in non-fucosylated xyloglucan. as demonstrated in figure  <dig>  the evolution process had succeeded in creating variants that demonstrated more intense staining in an immunofluorescence application. in addition, the time of labelling did not affect signal intensity  suggesting a rapid and specific binding to non-fucosylated xyloglucan. staining intensity of the cbm was also stable over at least  <dig> week after storage at 4°c. importantly, the specificity of the modules for non-fucosylated xyloglucan could be confirmed as the tamarind seed integument rich in fucosylated but not non-fucosylated xyloglucan, was not stained by xg- <dig> or by modules evolved from it . in contrast, other reagents specific for fucosylated xyloglucan stained the tamarind seed integument but not the endosperm 

discussion
in the search for analytical probes we have focused on investigating the potential of cbm4- <dig> as an alternative to the antibody scaffold for molecular engineering of modules with novel binding characteristics. we have in previous studies created a combinatorial library on the cbm4- <dig> scaffold  <cit>  from which modules that specifically bind different plant polysaccharides have been selected, e.g. xg- <dig> that recognizes only non-fucosylated xyloglucan  <cit> . in the present study we show for the first time that modules with the cbm4- <dig> scaffold can be further evolved using random mutagenesis in order to gain new binding properties such as improved affinity. this indicates a plasticity of the cbm4- <dig> scaffold and demonstrates its capacity for forced evolution.

the study resulted in the generation of three new xyloglucan-binding modules, xg-34/1-x, xg-34/2-i and xg-34/2-vi. compared to existing xyloglucan probes such as monoclonal antibodies lm <dig>  <cit>  that primarily binds to the non-galactosylated xyloglucan unit xxxg, and ccrc-m <dig>  <cit>  that recognizes only fucosylated xyloglucan, our high affinity binders differ by recognizing the galactose-decorated xyloglucan unit xllg, and by discriminating non-fucosylated from fucosylated xyloglucan. unfortunately, other xylogluco-oligosaccharides like xlxg and xxlg that may be present in non-fucosylated xyloglucan could not be assessed by itc as they were not available in sufficient quantities in pure form preventing a more complete specificity analysis. nevertheless, the combined data demonstrates a specificity of these modules different from the other existing probes. besides having higher affinity than xg- <dig> for soluble xyloglucan, the new binders also stained plant tissues from tamarind seed more intensely at high protein concentration and were at least equivalent at lower concentrations. these qualities demonstrate that the evolution achieved a molecular character that translated into an improved performance in terms of staining intensity in an analytical setting. the enhanced labelling may be a consequence of a higher affinity of the evolved variants not only for soluble xyloglucan, as assessed by itc, but also for some xyloglucan structures in these samples. more specifically, enhanced staining may be a consequence of a slightly modified fine specificity increasing the number of structures recognized in the tissue. indeed, molecular evolution of antibodies, the golden standard of binding probes, has been shown to be accompanied by such specificity fine-tuning  <cit> . altogether, the improved xyloglucan-binding modules can readily be utilized for xyloglucan recognition in plant sections and due to their novel binding properties that differentiate them from other xyloglucan probes, they provide a novel set of analytical tools, complementary to the existing ones.

one feature of the evolved xyloglucan binders is that all contained one mutation in common  compared to xg- <dig>  this mutation was shown to be crucial for the gained affinity for one of the modules. unfortunately, attempts to obtain crystal complexes of the cbm evolvants with xylogluco-oligosaccharides have so far been unsuccessful. consequently, the detailed structural role of the critical residue  <dig> in xyloglucan recognition is not fully understood. residue  <dig> is however most likely a residue that directly contacts carbohydrate ligands. in the wild type cbm4- <dig> and in models of evolved variants of xg- <dig>  the side chain of this residue is oriented towards the cavity into which carbohydrates are likely to bind  <cit>    and nmr signals from the backbone amide of residue  <dig> shifts upon addition of either xylopentaose or cellohexaose  <cit>  suggesting that it is involved in ligand binding. similarly, the side chain of this residue has been shown to be located in immediate proximity to the ligand in recently solved structures of a xylan-specific variant in complex with oligoxylose . it thus appears that the evolution process targeted a residue directly involved in ligand interaction. this is in contrast to antibodies whose evolution has often shown to result from mutations in the periphery or outside the binding-cleft both in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . future evolution studies will have to confirm whether this is a general evolutionary pathway for variants originating from the cbm4- <dig> scaffold or if mutations distant from the binding-cleft also are, as they are for antibodies, capable of fine-tuning ligand-binder affinity. glu <dig> in combination with other mutations present in xg-34/2-i  did not however result in an improved affinity, suggesting that one or several of these other mutations counteract the contribution in affinity for xyloglucan promoted by glu <dig>  one of the mutated residues,  <dig>  is a critical residue in the binding site of cbm4- <dig>  <cit> . this modification may thus be a major contributor to the relatively poor affinity of xg-34/2-i despite the presence of the asp <dig> → glu modification in this module.

the selection strategy involving capturing of biotinylated xyloglucan-phage complexes in the presence of soluble xyloglucan was successful as all three evolved cbm were extracted from the libraries by applying this methodology. thus, stringent conditions appeared to be required to find specific xgbm variants with higher affinity from libraries created from the cbm4- <dig> scaffold. this is in concordance with antibody phage methodology where it is known that binders with different characteristics can be identified by choosing different selection conditions  <cit> . thus, the same rules appear to apply to the selection of specific binders derived from the cbm4- <dig> scaffold, a fact that can be exploited to find binders optimal for a given application.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study shows that the binding characteristics, such as binding affinity, of modules selected from molecular libraries created on the cbm4- <dig> scaffold can be further improved by a molecular evolution process. this evolution resulted in the creation of three novel xyloglucan binders, out of which two showed greatly improved affinity for xyloglucan. the variants have a defined specificity, as they could be shown to specifically target galactose-decorated xyloglucan structures . in this respect, the two high affinity modules xg-34/1-x and xg-34/2-vi differ substantially from existing xyloglucan binders and constitute a novel analytical instrument for xyloglucan detection in plant sections. the great flexibility that can be applied to selection from phage-display libraries provides the scientist a substantial advantage over conventional monoclonal antibody technology in the search for binders with selected and defined properties. we envisage that the use of these technologies will provide a wide repertoire of defined reagents, important for the detailed analysis of plant tissues and plant-derived industrial material in the future.
