BACKGROUND
syphilis, caused by treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum , is a sexually transmitted multistage disease with a diagnosis based on clinical symptoms, serological findings and other methods such as direct detection of treponemes by microscopy. in the 1990s, pcr-based methods for direct detection of treponemal dna were developed  <cit> . since then, several improvements in these tests have been published which have increased sensitivity and specificity  <cit>  as well as the ability to detect the presence of several pathogens simultaneously in the same reaction using multiplex pcr  <cit> . a major advantage of pcr–based methods in syphilis diagnostics is the potential for subsequent molecular typing of syphilis treponemes. although several treponemal genomic loci were tested relative to their suitability for molecular typing  <cit> , most molecular typing studies of treponemal dna are performed using cdc typing  <cit> . the method involves detection of the number of 60-bp tandem repeats in the arp  gene and restriction fragment length polymorphism  analysis of the  <dig> pcr-amplified tpr genes . in  <dig>  the cdc method was modified by addition of sequencing of tp <dig>  <cit>  or by determination of the number of g repeats within the rpsa gene   <cit> .

recently, a sequencing-based molecular typing scheme based on sequencing of the tp <dig>  tp <dig> and 23s rrna genes was introduced  <cit> . moreover, the sequence variants of tp <dig>  tp <dig> and 23s rrna genes have been shown to independently combine with variants of the arp and tpr genes  <cit> .

in this communication, we compare cdc typing with sequence-based molecular typing in a group of patients with two or more parallel samples  that were pcr-positive for treponemal dna. moreover, the variability of gene sequences, length and rflp genotypes are compared in two types of clinical specimens .

RESULTS
pcr detection and molecular typing of syphilis treponemes
a total of  <dig> patients had two pcr-typeable samples , which were used for amplification of treponemal tp <dig>  tp <dig>  23s rrna genes, tpr and arp loci. two separate pcr-typeable swabs were available for each of  <dig> patients in one group of patients, while a second group of  <dig> patients had a single pcr-typeable swab along with a whole blood sample. four patients were diagnosed with secondary syphilis while the remaining  <dig> patients had primary syphilis .

x, the exact genotype was not determined.

*subtype identification based on cdc typing enhanced by sequence analysis of tp <dig> between position 131– <dig>  <cit> .

the samples from these  <dig> patients were typed with both cdc and sequence-based typing schemes  <cit> , the results are shown in table  <dig>  samples taken from  <dig> of  <dig> patients were completely typed at all loci . the remaining  <dig> patient samples were partially typed . cdc typing revealed  <dig> distinct genotypes while sequence-based typing revealed  <dig> genotypes. the identified sequences of tp <dig>  tp <dig> and 23s rdna loci are shown in additional file  <dig>  using enhanced cdc typing  <cit> ,  <dig> different genotypes were found . when results of molecular typing of tp <dig>  tp <dig>  and 23s rdna were available, no discrepancies in the genotypes were identified in samples taken from the same patients . in contrast, samples taken from  <dig> of  <dig> patients  revealed discrepancies at the arp and tpr loci . the most frequent discrepancies involved the “d” and “e” , “d” and “b”  and “d” and “p”  patterns of the tpr genes. two of four patients with secondary syphilis had differences at the tpr loci .

when analysis of loci used in sequence-based  and cdc typing  was performed independently,  <dig> swab/blood paired dna samples were analyzed in both sequence-based typing and in cdc typing. while no discrepancies were found in sequence-based typing,  <dig> out of  <dig> genotypes detected in cdc typing were different. similarly, analysis of parallel swabs revealed  <dig> and  <dig> typed dna samples for sequence-based and cdc typing, respectively. no discrepancies were found in sequence-based typing while  <dig> out of  <dig> genotypes detected in cdc typing were different.

four of  <dig>  patients  showed differences in tpr gene patterns while  <dig> of  <dig>  patients  showed pattern differences at the arp or tpr loci. the  <dig> differences found in the arp gene were found in patients with both swab and whole blood samples and in both cases the repetitions number of the arp gene was lower in whole blood samples compared to swab samples.

variability of treponemal genotypes found in whole blood and swab samples
to test whether individual genotype rates differ in swabs vs. whole blood samples, the occurrence rates of individual genotypes was determined in swabs and whole blood samples  using the data set from flasarová et al.  <cit>  augmented by samples collected in  <dig> in the czech republic. altogether,  <dig> swabs and  <dig> whole blood samples were analyzed. among the investigated strains, similar proportions of sequences  were identified for loci tp <dig> and tp <dig>  similarly, both a2058g and a2059g mutations in the 23s rdna showed similar occurrence rates in swabs and whole blood samples . however, the number of repetitions in the arp gene showed a significant difference between swab and wb samples. the arp gene with a lower number of repetitions was found to occur more often in wb samples. in addition, the most common tpr rflp type “d” occurred less often in wb samples while type “e” had a higher occurrence rate in wb samples.

samples isolated in the work of flasarová et al.  <cit>  augmented by samples collected in  <dig> in the czech republic were analyzed. results show both paired and unpaired samples.

discussion
molecular detection of treponemal dna and the subsequent molecular typing of t. pallidum strains have allowed epidemiological mapping of treponemal syphilis strains  <cit> . in recent years, there has been increasing evidence showing differences in molecular genetic markers among virulent treponemal strains isolated in different countries  <cit> . some studies have shown that predominant treponemal strains in a particular population can change over time  <cit> .

the selection of suitable genetic loci appears to be of enormous importance. genetic loci suitable for molecular typing should contain a relatively high degree of variability and relatively high stability in future generations of the microbial population. several genetic loci including tprk, tprc and the intergenic region between tp0126-tp <dig> have been tested for their suitability for molecular typing and rejected because of multiallelic sequences  <cit>  or because of a lack of discriminatory power  <cit> .

the most widely used molecular typing system  <cit>  and its improved versions  <cit>  are in principle based on detection of genetic variability in the arp and tpr genes. as shown by liu et al.  <cit> , the repeat motifs in the arp gene code for highly immunogenic protein sequences and represent a potential fibronectin-binding domain. the arp gene in t. pallidum strains is subject to positive selection and the size variation in repeat motifs in t. pallidum strains is likely connected with mechanisms that treponemes use to escape/evade the host’s immune response, which has been primed against the standard  14-repeat variant  <cit> . genes tpre, g and j are potential virulence factors and belong to tpr subfamily ii  <cit> . these genes are expressed during syphilis infection  <cit>  and the tprej proteins are likely located on the outer membrane  <cit> . recently, giacani et al.  <cit>  demonstrated how the number of poly-g repeats effected transcription of tpre, g, and j through a phase variation mechanism, and the modulating effect of the tp <dig> gene on the level of transcription of these tpr genes  <cit> . we have shown that these loci are often variable in samples taken from the same patient. although coinfection with two genetically different treponemal strains cannot be excluded, it appears unlikely since typing with other markers, including the tp <dig>  tp <dig>  and 23s rdna loci, revealed identical sequences despite the fact that the latter typing scheme identified only  <dig> different genotypes among the  <dig> patients sampled in this study.

under experimental conditions, pillay et al.  <cit>  showed that the cdc genotype is stable in repeated rabbit passages of t. pallidum nichols strain and others have confirmed this finding  <cit> . moreover, genetic stability has been shown for two additional treponemal strains  using experimental infections of rabbits  <cit> . however, human infection may differ considerably from experimental rabbit infections. these differences represent differences in il- <dig> levels produced by th <dig> cells  during the early cellular response to t. pallidum in the rabbit model, where the mrna il- <dig> levels were considerably lower than il- <dig> levels  <cit> . on the other hand, il- <dig> mrna levels in early human lesions had comparable levels of il- <dig>  <cit> . moreover, in contrast to rabbit infections, cd8+ t-cells are often the dominant t-cell during human infections  <cit> .

it has been shown that skin and blood represent two immunologically distinct compartments with respect to syphilis infections  <cit> . cellular immunity seems to be more important than humoral immunity in the clearance of t. pallidum from early syphilis lesions  <cit> . the inability of humoral immunity to control the infection is demonstrated by formation of secondary syphilis lesions despite the presence of high antibody titers against treponemal antigens  <cit> . it is likely that these immunologically different compartments produce different selection forces that act on treponemes living in skin lesions and in whole blood. to confirm this hypothesis, we tested a spectrum of different genotypes from both swabs and whole blood samples. interestingly, the spectrum of the arp and tpr variant significantly differed between swabs and whole blood samples indicating their instability and differences in selection of treponeme variants in both niches. alternatively, differences in the arp and tpr loci could result in lowered adherence of these treponemes to human cells prompting increased migration of these treponemes from primary lesions to other human compartments.

there are only a few studies describing the genetic analysis of multiple parallel samples taken from one patient at the same time  <cit> . moreover, only a limited number of parallel samples were analyzed in these studies  and this fact likely precluded identification of the variability of detected genotypes. in addition, only a limited number of studies used whole blood samples for molecular typing, mainly because of lower frequency of pcr-positive results  <cit> . when the published data were analyzed  <cit> ,  <dig> wb and  <dig> swab samples were fully typed using the cdc typing system. the most prevalent subtype in swab samples was 14d , which were similar to our results . as with swabs, the  <dig> repetition version of the arp gene was also the most common in wb samples. the most common tpr profile in wb samples was ‘a’, found in  <dig> of  <dig> wb samples  <cit> . interestingly, none of the wb subtypes identified in our study  were similar to the published wb subtypes.

there are several limitations to this study. one of these is the small number of available parallel pcr-typeable samples taken from the same patient. therefore, observed differences should be interpreted with caution and more parallel samples need to be tested in future. another limitation is the small number of fully-typed samples, especially in the sequence-based typing system. the observed lower discriminatory power of sequence-based typing compared to cdc typing is likely a result of genetic variability of tpr and arp loci, however, this explanation needs to be verified.

taken together, parallel samples taken from the same patient, at the same time, revealed potential instability at the tpr and arp loci, which is often used in molecular typing of treponemes. these loci are likely to show treponemal intra-strain variability and the results of molecular typing should be interpreted with caution, especially in epidemiological studies. differences in frequencies of genotypes in whole blood and swab samples suggest an antigenic/adherence character for proteins encoded by these loci and also immunological differences between compartments .

CONCLUSIONS
the cdc typing scheme revealed subtype differences in parallel samples taken from  <dig> of  <dig> tested patients . the arp and tpr loci are likely to show treponemal intra-strain variability since the sequence-based typing system revealed identical sequences in the tp <dig>  tp <dig>  and 23s rrna genes. therefore, the results of cdc typing should be interpreted with caution, especially in epidemiological studies. differences in treponemal genotypes detected in whole blood and swab samples suggest immunological differences between the skin and whole blood compartments and/or differences in adherence of genetic variants of treponemes to human cells.
