BACKGROUND
azo dyes are characterized by one or more azo bonds  that allow visible light to be absorbed by the dyes. these dyes are used in a wide variety of consumer products including textile, paper, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food  <cit> . azo dyes such as sudan dyes are not legal for use as colorants in foods, however, they recently have been detected as contaminants in the food supply  <cit> . the human health impact of exposure to azo dyes used in certain food products has caused concern since they may have genotoxic properties. the environmental fate and subsequent heath effects of the azo dyes released in textile and paper industry wastewater are increasing being studied by the scientific community  <cit> .

while azo dyes are generally considered to be persistent pollutants because they are typically recalcitrant to aerobic biotransformation  <cit> , they may be metabolized by azoreductases from commensal microorganisms, mammalian liver cells, and soil microorganisms  <cit> . a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, are capable of decolorizing a diverse range of azo dyes. some bacteria have the ability to degrade azo dyes both aerobically and anaerobically  <cit> . bacterial degradation of azo dyes is often initiated by cleavage of azo bonds by azoreductases which are followed by the aerobic degradation of the resulting amines  <cit> . two types of oxygen-insensitive azoreductases have been identified in bacteria: one is monomeric flavin-free enzymes containing a putative nadh binding motif and the other is polymeric flavin-dependent enzymes  <cit> . the genes encoding oxygen-insensitive flavin dependent azoreductases have been cloned from bacillus sp. oy1- <dig>  <cit> , escherichia coli  <cit> , enterococcus faecalis  <cit> , rhodobacter sphaeroides  <cit> , pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> , and staphylococcus aureus  <cit> . biochemical characteristics of bacterial fmn-dependent azoreductases and the protein structures of several enzymes have been recently determined  <cit> . moreover, the role of specific amino acid residues involved in flavin binding and catalytic mechanism of oxygen-insensitive flavin dependent azoreductase from e. faecalis has been analyzed  <cit> .

two monomeric flavin-free azoreductases from xenophilus azovorans kf46f  <cit>  and pigmentiphaga kullae k <dig>  <cit>  have been described. however, little is known about the structure and function of monomeric flavin-free azoreductases from bacteria. p. kullae k <dig> was first described to contain oxygen-insensitive flavin-free azoreductase. this soil bacterium was isolated by long-term adaptation in the chemostat for growth on orange i as the sole source of carbon and energy  <cit> . as a part of structure and function study of monomeric flavin-free azoreductases, we describe in this study the cloning and identification of a gene, azob, which encodes a novel flavin-free nadh/nadph dependent oxygen-insensitive azoreductase from p. kullae k <dig> 

RESULTS
cloning of an azoreductase gene  from p. kullae k24
an azoreductase gene, designed as azob, was amplified from genomic dna of p. kullae k <dig> by pcr using a pair of primers  yielding a dna band of about  <dig> bp  on agarose gel . it was directly ligated to ta cloning vector, pcr <dig> -topo. sequencing of the insert revealed that it contained  <dig> bp dna fragment with a complete orf . azob encoded a protein consisting of  <dig> amino acid residues of  <dig>  dalton. the deduced protein sequence of azob displayed 61% primary structure identity to p. kullae k <dig> azoreductase a  and had three amino acid residues more in size than that of the azoa . three deletion and/or insertion differences between these two protein sequences were found .

functional expression of the azoreductase in e. coli
azob was inserted via its unique ndei and bamhi restriction sites into corresponding sites of pet-11a. the enzyme  was functionally expressed as a native enzyme without modification in e. coli with a phage t7-promotor system. crude-cell extracts were prepared from cultures of e. coli bl21-goldplyss carrying the expression plasmid pazob, which had been induced by the addition of  <dig>  mm iptg for  <dig>  h. supernatant of the cell-extract from the induced culture displayed an elevated level of azoreductase activity  in comparison with that of the non-induced culture , indicating that the enzyme was induced and functionally expressed in the host.

purification of azob of p. kullae k <dig> from the recombinant e. coli
the azoreductase was purified from the supernatant of the iptg-induced recombinant e. coli by a combination of hydrophobic interaction chromatographies and ion exchange columns . the enzyme was purified nearly  <dig> -fold with a yield of 45%, which allows the proportion of the enzyme to be estimated at  <dig> % of the total protein present in the crude cell extract. the specific activity of the purified p. kullae k <dig> azob was  <dig>  u/mg protein using orange i as the substrate. sds-page analysis showed that the molecular weight of the purified azoreductase was  <dig> kda . gel filtration chromatography on a hiload superdex  <dig> column conformed the molecular weight obtained by sds-page. in comparison to that of azoa  from p. kullae k <dig> the enzyme has a high specific activity . only orange i can be reduced by azob, while methyl red, amaranth, ponceau bs, ponceau s, orange ii, orange g, megneson ii, 1--2-naphthol, and 4--resorcinol were not reduced. the purified azob is colorless and no absorption spectrum of flavins was detected in the enzyme solution.

aactivities were determided with nadh as proton donor.

properties of the recombinant azob of p. kullae k24
enzymatic reactions were carried out by varying the concentration of one substrate and fixing the other substrate concentration at the same time. analysis of the purified azob indicated the enzyme used both nadh and nadph for orange i reduction. apparent km and vmax values were obtained from lineweaver-burk plots. the km values for nadh and orange i are  <dig> and  <dig>  μm, respectively . when nadph served as the electron donor, the activity of the enzyme is 63% higher than nadh. the km of nadph for the enzyme is about  <dig>  μm. when the enzyme activities were carried out in  <dig> mm sorensen's phosphate buffer with different ph values and orange i as substrate, the optimum ph was found to be around  <dig> , as shown in figure 3a. enzyme activities were measured under different temperature from 25°c to 60°c. as shown in figure 3b, the optimum temperature of the enzyme was found to be 45°c.

* data were presented by the averages from triplicate with standard deviations of <10%;

in silico analysis of azob from p. kullae k24
p. kullae k <dig> azob belongs to the flavin-free azoreductase group that displays over 39% sequence identity to each in the third group, with the exception of azob from x. azovorans kf46f, which shows very low sequence identity with other azoreductases . the pd values within each group were less than  <dig> . while the overall degree of amino acid sequence identity between groups is no more than 18%, members in each group show over 23% sequence identity to one another. a key fingerprint motif for nadh binding was identified at the n-terminus of the deduced amino acid sequences of the flavin-free azoreductase group. sequence alignment of flavin-free azoreductases revealed three conserved glys  and an arg that are known to govern dinucleotide recognition  <cit> . in flavin-dependent nadph-azoreductase group, the majority of enzymes show the glycine-rich pyrophosphate-binding motifs gxgxxg or gxxgxxg . however, any type of glycine-rich pyrophosphate binding motifs was not conserved in the protein sequences of flavin-dependent nadh-azoreductase group.

3d structural model of azob from strain k <dig> was constructed using the crystal structure  of the putative epimerase from bacteroides thetaiotaomicron as a template. rmsd  of the azob model  superimposed on the 3dhn  is  <dig>  Å, in which  <dig> amino acid residues were aligned with 42% sequence identity. in azob, the pyrophosphate-binding loop of three conserved glycine residues arranged as g7xxg10xxg <dig> connects the c-terminus of β <dig> with the n-terminus of α <dig> . especially, arg is in a favorable position for interaction with the monophosphate at the 02' position of adenine ribose in nadph   <cit> .

in sas analysis of azob, three bacterial unknown functional proteins, 3dhn from b. thetaiotaomicron, 3ew <dig> from listeria monocytogenes, and 3h2s from lactobacillus casei showed the highest smith-waterman scores with sequence identity of 43%,  <dig> %, and 32%, respectively. despite a relatively low sequence identity  with amino acid overlap of  <dig>  a human biliverdin ixβ reductase , which is an early fetal bilirubin ixβ producing enzyme, shows appreciable overall alignment of secondary structure with azob. rmsd of 1hdo  superimposed on azob  is  <dig>  Å on  <dig> residues aligned with 17% sequence identity  <cit> .

discussion
in our effort to study the three dimensional structure of flavin-independent azoreductase and mechanism of azo dye reduction by the enzyme, we characterized a novel azoreductase gene encoding a flavin-free azoreductase from p. kullae k <dig>  cell-extract from the recombinant p. kullae k <dig> azob revealed an azoreductase activity of 6-fold higher than that of cell-extract from the recombinant azoa. the specific activity of the purified azob is about 3-fold higher than that of azoa. these data demonstrated that azob is facile to be expressed and the enzyme is very efficient in reducing orange i compared to azoa from p. kullae k <dig>  <cit> . among the tested azo dyes, azob is only able to reduce orange i and not the monoazo dye magneson ii. on the other hand, azoa has minor activity against magneson ii .

azob requires  <dig> mol of nadph as four electron donor for the complete reductive cleavage of orange i to sulfanilic acid and 1-amino-4-naphthaol. attempts to orient nadph in azob were guided by two criteria. first, the three conserved glycine residues gly- <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> interact with the pyrophosphate of nadph. second, arg- <dig> interacts with the 2'-phosphate, providing an anchor for the 2'-phophate-amp half of nadph, defining the coenzyme specificity. the presence of at least one arg side chain in the vicinity of the 2'-phosphate of nadp is a common feature of nadp dinucleotide binding fold complex  <cit> . in contrast, it is known that nad- and fad-binding rossmann fold proteins have an acidic amino acid residue of asp or glu in the position where the functional group carboxylate hydrogen bonds to the 2' hydroxyl of the adenine ribose  <cit> . the information addresses the limitation on availability of nadh in azob, although the enzyme utilizes both nadh and nadph. as shown in figure  <dig>  when bound in the active site of azob, the nicotinamide ring of nadph is located in a cleft large enough to accept the substrate orange i. the suggested nadph binding mode and putative substrate binding site of the azob:nadph binary complex support the idea that azob joins two substrates, orange i and nadph, together, in the active site, in which the reaction center of orange i lies near to the reactive c <dig> of the nadph, an appropriate position for direct hydride transfer rather than a proton-relay catalytic reaction. bibliomic data strongly supports the proposed catalysis model  <cit> . a human monomeric nadph-dependent biliverdin ixβ reductase , with its overall structure that is closely related to azob, has adopted the same reaction mechanism, in which the substrates, nadph and biliverdin share a common binding site for direct hydride transfer from the c <dig> of the dinucleotide  <cit> .

there is a clear correlation between structure, cofactor requirement, and substrate specificity in azoreductases. among the tested azo dyes, azob is only able to degrade orange i, and other monomeric flavin-free azoreductases also show very narrow substrate specificity  <cit> . on the other hand, polymeric flavin-dependent azoreductase families can catalyze substrates which vary in both chemical nature and size  <cit> . structural characteristics in the active sites appear to dictate the substrate diversity of the enzymes. for example, the dimeric azoa from e. faecalis has two separate active sites located at the interfaces between the two monomers, and fmn lies inside each active site, in which si face of the isoalloxazine ring provides room for both nadh and substrate binding for the sequential transfer of four electrons from nadh to the substrate via fmn  <cit> . the enzyme is not only able to decolorize methyl red, but is also able to convert sulfonated azo dyes orange ii, amaranth, ponceau bs, and ponceau s. on the other hand, azob has a relatively small substrate binding site, which simultaneously accepts both the nicotinamide ring of nadph and the substrate in the catalytic cycle. moreover, the demands for successful direct hydride transfer between the two substrates require more sophisticated binding mode. presumably because of these constraints, the number of substrates catalyzed by the monomeric azoreductases is limited. a survey of the efficiency of various azo dyes as substrate for an orange ii flavin free azoreductase from x. azovorans kf46f revealed that a hydroxygroup in the 2-position of the naphthol ring of azo dyes is required and it is only able to reduce orange ii and its analogues  <cit> . azoa from p. kullae k <dig> converted only azo dyes that carried a hydroxyl group in the 4-position of the naphthol ring relative to the azo group  <cit> .

bacterial oxygen-insensitive azoreductases can be classified into at least three distinct non-homologous groups, based on structure, flavin dependency, and dinucleotide preference. phylogenetic analysis also mirrors well the grouping scheme at the molecular level. the cofactor preference further divides the polymeric azoreductases into two different groups, and the third group is strikingly different from the two polymeric azoreductase groups in respect of both its structural and biochemical requirements for catalytic process. based on its biochemical and phylogenetic relationship, the enzymes of monomeric azoreductase group seem to have a different origin but have developed towards the same chemical function of azoreduction, suggesting convergent evolution. nevertheless, significant difference in biochemistry and structure indicates that the monomeric azoreductase group has adopted different catalytic strategies from that of the polymeric azoreductase groups.

CONCLUSIONS
azob from strain k <dig> is a member of the monomeric flavin-free nadph-preferred azoreductase group. biochemical analysis and homology modeling studies of azob demonstrated how nadph is recognized and oriented in the active site. our data indicated a narrow substrate specificity of the enzyme. phylogenetic analysis revealed that the oxygen-insensitive azoreductases can be divided into three distinct groups. further investigations on the protein crystallization and mutant experiments to obtain decisive proof of the proposed biochemistry of azob from strain k <dig> are warranted.
