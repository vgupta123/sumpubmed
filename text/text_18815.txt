BACKGROUND
agricultural residues, forests and agro industrial practices generally accumulated in the environment and caused pollution problem. active efforts were being made to convert these organic waste resources into either glucose or alcohol, and use this either as fuel or as a valuable starting material for chemical synthesis  <cit> . saccharification of polysaccharides to glucose by microbial hydrolytic enzymes which had attracted the attention of the researchers, as this was the first step of bioconversion of organic material into valuable products such as sugar, fine chemicals and biofuels  <cit> . as the cost of cellulosic substrates play the central role in determining the economy of the saccharification process, lot of emphasis had been given to the usage of low price substrates and therefore screening of the agricultural wastes for release of sugars as organic wastes from renewable forest and agricultural residues  <cit> . the saccharification of different agro-wastes had been reported by other workers employing enzymes from different organisms .

recently, a significant interest raised in using solid state fermentation  instead of submerged fermentation . the advantages of ssf in comparison to traditional smf were better yields, easier recovery of products, the absence of foam formation and smaller reactor volumes. moreover, contamination risks were significantly reduced due to the low water contents and, consequently, the volume of effluents decreases  <cit> . another very important advantage was that, it permits the use of agricultural and agro-industrial residues as substrates which were converted into products with high commercial value like secondary metabolites, organic acids, pesticides, aromatic compounds, fuels and enzymes  <cit> . furthermore, the utilization of these compounds helps in solving pollution, which otherwise caused their disposal  <cit> . for enzyme production, the costs of these techniques were lower and the production higher than submerged cultures  <cit> .

structural properties of cellulose such as the degree of crystallinity, the degree of polymerization and the surface area, limit accessibility of substrate to enzyme and had been demonstrated  <cit>  to affect the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose. pretreatment methods, which disrupted the highly-ordered cellulose structure and the lignin-carbohydrate complex, remove lignin, and increase the surface area accessible to enzymes, promoted the hydrolysis, and increased the rate and extent of hydrolysis of cellulose in various lignocellulosic residues. the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic materials correlated with the level of cellulose crystallinity  <cit>  complete enzymatic hydrolysis of the polysaccharides of lignocelluloses required a concerted action of a complex array of hydrolases including cellulase, xylanase, pectinase, and other side-group cleavage enzymes  <cit> .

several cell-decomposing microorganisms produce cellulases which were the most economic and available sources for fermentable sugar production, because these microorganisms could grow on inexpensive media. the genus trichoderma, filamentous ascomycetes were widely used in industrial applications because of high secretary capacity and inducible promoting characteristics  <cit> . the structural complexity were often easily degraded by xylanases, mannanases etc. which were present in some cellulase preparations, so that their presence may actually lead to increased production of reducing sugars and greater susceptibility of the residual cellulose .

in continuation of our interest in the saccharification of agriculture wastes by ssf  <cit> , we wished to report an investigation and comparative evaluation among trichoderma sp., t. reesei, t. viride, t. harzianum and t. virens for the saccharification of four alkali-pretreated agricultural residues, wheat bran, date’s seeds, wild grass and palm’s leaves under solid state fermentation for the production of hydrolytic enzymes, carboxymethyl cellulase , filter paperase , pectinase  and xylanase . the polysaccharide composition of these agricultural residues included different concentrations from cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin . the optimization of the physiological conditions of production of hydrolytic enzymes and saccharification content from t. virens using alkali-pretreated wheat bran was the last goal.

solid state fermentation
ssf was performed to study the effect of various physicochemical parameters required for the optimum production of enzymes and saccharification content by trichoderm sp. prior to inoculation, the agriculture waste was sterilized in an autoclave for 20 min at  <dig> °c and  <dig>  atmospheres. to each 50 ml erlenmeyer flask, 5 g of sterilized agriculture waste, 5 ×  <dig> spores/g, and appropriate amount of water  were added. the physico-chemical parameters included incubation time, incubation temperature , moisture content of the substrate  and incubation ph  were optimized. the ph was adjusted using  <dig>  m naoh or hcl. studies were also performed to evaluate the influence of different carbon sources  and nitrogen sources  when added to the fermentation medium contained agriculture waste. each experiment is done in  <dig> sets.

enzyme extraction
crude enzyme was extracted by mixing a 5 g of fermented matter with 50 ml distilled water on a rotary shaker  overnight. the suspension was then centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was designated as a crude extract.

enzyme assays
carboxymethylcellulase , filter paperase , pectinase  and xylanase  activities were assayed by determining the liberated reducing end products using glucose, glucose, galacturonic acid and xylose as standards, respectively  <cit> . substrates used were cm-cellulose, filter paper, polygalacturonic acid and birchwood xylan for cmcase, fpase, pgase and xylase, respectively. the reaction mixture  contained  <dig> % substrate,  <dig>  m sodium acetate buffer ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  ml crude extract. assays were carried out at  <dig> °c for 1 h. then  <dig>  ml dinitrosalicylic acid reagent was added to each tube. then the reaction mixture was mixed well, and heated in a boiling water bath for 10 min. after cooling to room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 560 nm. one unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme which liberated one μmol of reducing sugar per min under standard assay conditions. all the experimental work was run in triplicates.

RESULTS
production of cmcase, fpase, pgase and xylase were tested using alkali pretreated wheat bran, date's seeds, wild grass and palm leaves as substrates by t. reesei, t. viride, t. harzianum and t. virens in solid state fermentation . figure  <dig> showed that the maximum production of cmcase, fpase, xylase were obtained by t. virens  in ssf containing alkali pre-treated wheat bran, while maximum pgase activity was obtained by t. reesei  in ssf containing alkali pre-treated palm leaves. among the different solid substrates screened, saccharification of alkali pre-treated wheat bran supported maximum yields of total carbohydrates and reducing sugars  by t. virens compared with other trichoderma sp. tested . there was no relation between total carbohydrate/sugar and enzyme contents, except of wild grasses and wheat bran. this may be attributed to some fungi used the total carbohydrate and sugar as nutrients  for growth of fungi, resulted in the depletion of the total carbohydrate and sugar. from these results, the optimization of the production of total carbohydrate, reducing sugar, cmcase, fpase, pgase and xylase of t. virens using alkali pre-treated wheat bran in ssf was performed in the following studies.fig.  <dig> effect of different organic materials on the production of cmcase, fpase, pgase and xylase by trichoderma sp. in ssf. process conditions: incubation times 72 h, initial moisture content  <dig> %  and temperature  <dig> °c. the data presented were averages of three experiments

figure  <dig> shows the time course experiments of cmcase, fpase, xylase, pgase and protein production by t. virens grown on alkali pretreated wheat bran in ssf. all enzymes and protein exhibited their maximum activities  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> u/g and  <dig>  mg/g at 72 hours. however, time course of enzyme cellulase production by trichoderma spp. was studied using steamed alkali-treated sugarcane bagasse at  <dig> °c for six days. cmcase biosynthesis was not detected up to 24 hours of incubation and then the enzyme activity increased sharply up to 72 hours and highest cmcase activity was found  <dig>  u/ml at 144 hours. fpase production started after a large lag period  and thereafter the enzyme synthesis increase sharply. the final fpase activity was  <dig>  u/ml at 144 hours. initially, xylase production was low and at 96 hours a sharp increase in enzyme production was observed and after that the enzyme activity remained constant. the highest xylase activity was found after 144 hours of incubation which was  <dig>  u/ml  <cit> . of all four strains of fungi, t. reesei and t. viride were the best cellulase-producing fungi after 72 h offer mutation. a co-culture of t. reesei and t. viride gave better results with wheat straw; the cmcase activities were  <dig>  and  <dig>  iu, respectively  <cit> . another study reported that pgase and xylase of t. virens, exhibited their maximum activity at day  <dig>   <cit> . similarly, penicillium decumbens was grown on a mixture of corn straw  and wheat bran  the maximum activity of xylase was measured after 4 days of fermentation  <cit> . couri et al.  <cit>  also studied the production of xylase by a. niger using different agroindustrial residues – mango peel and wheat bran – as the solid substrate. the maximum of xylase activity was reached after 72 h and 24 h of fermentation using wheat brain and mango peel, respectively.fig.  <dig> effect of incubation time on the production of cmcase, fpase, pgase, xylase and protein by t. virens in ssf using alkali pre-treated wheat bran as a substrate. process conditions: incubation times 72 h, initial moisture content  <dig> %  and temperature  <dig> °c. the data presented were averages of three experiments



the increase in glucose production depends on availability of cellulose in the medium and also due to the specific binding of the enzymes with substrates  <cit> . saccharification of alkali pre-treated wheat bran in ssf was shown in fig.  <dig> with a maximum yield  <dig>  mg/g reducing sugars and  <dig>  mg/g total carbohydrates obtained at 72 h by t. virens. begum and alimon  <cit>  obtained the maximum amount of reducing sugar  measured in sugarcane bagasse after alkali pre-treatment at 24 h by aspergillus oryzae itcc- <dig> . they also obtained the highest saccharification for alkali-reated sugarcane bagasse at 96 hrs when water hyacinth induced enzyme was used. they concluded that the saccharification rates of alkali pre-treated substrates were higher than those of enzymatic treated substrates. similarly, ja’afaru and fagade  <cit>  recorded the highest reducing sugar  <dig>  mg/ml for alkali pre-treated corn cob at 48 hrs. time course of enzymatic saccharification of alkali pre-treated bagasse showed rapid initial increase of reducing sugar concentration  and the rate of this increase was substantially reduced at later stages by t. viride  <cit> .fig.  <dig> effect of incubation time on the saccharification content by t. virenss in ssf using alkali pre-treated wheat bran. process conditions: initial moisture content  <dig> %  and temperature  <dig> °c. the data presented were averages of three experiments



the moisture content was an important factor that influences the growth and product yield in ssf  <cit> . moisture was reported to cause swelling of the substrates, thereby facilitating better utilization of the substrate by microorganisms  <cit> . the data presented in the figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  clearly indicated a maximum production of the enzymes cmcase, fpase, xylase and pgase ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> % moisture. the highest level of protein production was detected at  <dig> % moisture. for cmcase production moisture level was optimized and found that  <dig> % moisture level was best for production by t. viridei  <cit> . any further increase in the ratio resulted in the decrease of enzyme yields may be due to clumping of solid particles which results in the decrease of interparticle space leading to decreased diffusion of nutrients  <cit> . in contrast, the low moisture content leads to the decreased solubility of nutrients present in the wheat bran thereby decreases enzyme yields  <cit> . the optimum moisture contents for xylase production by t. longibrachiatum and a. tereus were  <dig> and  <dig> %, respectively  <cit> . a high production of xylase of aspergillus species was detected at 40– <dig> % moisture using dry koji as substrate  <cit> . an initial moisture content of  <dig> % provided better conditions for production of pgase from a. niger than those of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> %  <cit> .fig.  <dig> effect of moisture % on the production of cmcase, fpase, pgase, xylase and protein by t. virens in ssf using alkali pre-treated wheat bran as a substrate. process conditions: incubation times 72 h, and temperature  <dig> °c. the data presented were averages of three experiments

the incubation temperature is very important in enzyme production  <cit> . the usual temperature maintained in ssf systems was in the range of 25- <dig> °c, depending on the growth kinetics of microorganism employed for fermentation purposes  <cit> . in the present study, the optimum temperature for maximum production of both cmcase and pgase was  <dig> °c; and  <dig> °c for fpase and xylase at  <dig> °c . the protein content was ranged from  <dig> to 8 mg/g for all temperatures tested with high level at  <dig> °c. this was confirmed by maximum reducing sugar  at  <dig> °c and total carbohydrates  at  <dig> °c . in contrast, maximum hydrolysis of substrates occurred at  <dig> °c  <cit> . other studies had reported that  <dig> °c was found best for cmcase secretion by t. viride  <cit> . optimal pgase and xylase production  was obtained at  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c for t. harzianum, respectively  <cit> . on the contrary, the maximum activity of pgase and xylase  of t. virens was detected at  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c, respectively. similar optimal temperatures of production of pgase and xylanase from penicillium decumbens  <cit> , a. niger  <cit> , a. oryzae  <cit> , and a. awamori  <cit>  were ranged from  <dig> °c to  <dig> °c. in the steady state operation for production of xylase by a. niger the optimum temperature was  <dig> °c. results showed that higher incubation temperature favors biomass growth and lower temperature favors the biosynthesis of xylanase  <cit> . the maximal pgase production by mixed culture of a. niger and saccharomyces cerevisiae was detected at  <dig> °c  <cit> .fig.  <dig> effect of incubation temperature on the production of cmcase, fpase, pgase, xylase and protein by t. virens in ssf using alkali pre-treated wheat bran as a substrate. process conditions: incubation times 72 h and initial moisture content  <dig> % . the data presented were averages of three experiments

the influence of supplementary carbon sources such as starch, sucrose, maltose, lactose or glucose at  <dig> %  on production of cmcase, fpase, xylase, pgase and protein was studied. the protein content was slightly increased in presences of the carbon sources. while lactose and sucrose enhanced the activity of pgase from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  u/g solid, respectively, starch inhibited all other enzymes . this was confirmed by maximum saccharification content of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/g reducing sugars respectively by lactose and sucrose, and minimum reducing sugars of  <dig>  mg/g by starch . however, starch and sucrose enhanced the xylase activities from  <dig> to 55– <dig> units/g solid, while all carbon sources exhibited slightly effect on pgase activities for trichoderma spp. using cantaloupe and watermelon rinds  <cit> . botella et al.  <cit>  reported that when  <dig> % glucose was added as extra carbon source, the production of xylase and pgase by a. awamori using grape pomace as substrate increased significantly. however, at  <dig> % both enzyme activities declined. in contrast, when wheat bran was used as the solid substrate, xylase by a. tamari was resistant to catabolic repression even at  <dig> % glucose  <cit> . alternatively, d-glucose, d-mannose, maltose, sucrose and cellobiose significantly repressed cmcase formation in case of using rice straw and sugar cane bagasse as carbon sources  <cit> .fig.  <dig> effect of carbon source  supplementation on the production of cmcase, fpase, pgase, xylase and protein by t. virens in ssf using alkali pre-treated wheat bran as a substrate. process conditions: incubation times 72 hr, initial moisture content  <dig> %  and temperature  <dig> °c. the data presented were averages of three experiments

studies on supplementation of nitrogen sources such as ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride, yeast extract or urea at  <dig> % concentration to the solid substrates showed various effects on cmcase, fpase, xylase, pgase and protein production by t. virens . all nitrogen sources enhanced the saccharification enzymes with significant enhancement for cmcase , pgase  and xylase  by yeast extract and urea. this was confirmed by maximum saccharification from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  by yeast extract and urea respectively . however, ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, yeast extract and urea increased pgase activities of t. harzianum from  <dig> to 110– <dig> units/g solid and decreased pgase activities of t. virens. the high level of protein was detected in presence of kno <dig>  however, urea increased xylase activities of t. harzianum and t. virens  <cit> . among nitrogen sources yeast extract was the best to enhance the enzyme activity fpase  and cmcase  by a. fumigatus grown on alkali-pretreated sawdust  <cit> . another study reported the highest level of enzyme formation expressed in terms of specific activity with ammonium chloride with both rice straw and sugar cane bagasse by a. terreus dsm  <dig>  other nitrogen sources namely ammonium sulphate, potassium nitrate and ammonium oxalate gave also considerable amounts of cmcase with both wastes as compared with sodium nitrate  <cit> .fig.  <dig> effect of nitrogen source  supplementation on the production of cmcase, fpase, pgase, xylase and protein by t. virens in ssf using alkali pre-treated wheat bran as a substrate. process conditions: incubation times 72 h, initial moisture content  <dig> %  and temperature  <dig> °c. the data presented were averages of three experiments
