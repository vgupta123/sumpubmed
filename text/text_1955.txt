BACKGROUND
regulation of cell growth is of crucial importance for the survival of all living cells. much effort, therefore, has focused on understanding the mechanisms that control how cells achieve balanced growth, e.g. control of the cell cycle and biosynthesis of cellular building blocks. to date, dna microarray technology  <cit>  has had a considerable impact in defining causal relationships between different growth conditions and the transcriptional response of cells. a number of previous studies in s. cerevisiae have focused on the genome-wide transcriptional response of cells to nutrient limitation  <cit> , oxygen availability  <cit>  and growth rate .

to identify growth rate dependent genes, two major requirements must be met. first, the specific growth rate of the culture  must be controlled. this is necessary to eliminate variability that is inherent in dynamic batch cultivation  <cit> . the general approach for obtaining constant specific growth rate is through continuous i.e. chemostat cultivation. here the specific growth rate is kept constant by continuously feeding a culture with fresh nutrients having one limiting reagent at a specific dilution rate . the dilution rate is adjusted to obtain different specific growth rates. second, it is also important to measure gene expression patterns over a range of specific growth rates. by studying factors in addition to specific growth rate , growth rate dependent genes that are independent of environmental factors can be identified.

previous works have suggested that growth rate has a tremendous influence on the yeast transcriptional program. specifically, regenberg et al.  <cit>  described more than  <dig> growth rate dependent genes and proposed a role for the chromosomal location in the regulation of these genes. castrillo et al.  <cit>  adopted a systems biology approach to investigate the effect of growth rate at the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome levels. they identified about  <dig> genes whose expression is growth regulated and concentrated, in particular, on the role of the tor complex  <dig>  more recently, brauer et al.  <cit>  determined that transcript levels of more than one quarter of all yeast genes are linearly correlated with growth rate. while growth rate dependent genes have been identified from single factor studies  <cit>  and two factor designs, such as growth rate and nutrient limitation  <cit> , multi-factor designs, such as the approach presented here, are expected to identify growth rate dependent genes that are more independent of the specific growth conditions.

here we carried out a three factor design to dissect the role of growth rate on the transcriptional program of yeast. the three factors were specific growth rate, nutrient limitation , and oxygen availability. for the specific growth rate, multiple levels, i.e.  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  h- <dig> were evaluated. in the context of growth rate studies, the effect of oxygen availability has not yet been considered. beyond identifying growth rate dependent genes independent of nutrient limitation and oxygen availability, we sought to use recently developed systems biology tools to distinguish transcription factors  that may coordinate and regulate the processes that control cellular growth .

RESULTS
a three-factor design to investigate growth rate dependent genes
to study the growth-rate related transcriptional response in s. cerevisiae cen.pk113-7d, we applied a systems approach that integrated transcriptome measurements with data from protein-dna interaction networks. a  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> factorial design was pursued resulting in  <dig> different growth conditions , which have been investigated in triplicate. specifically, steady-state conditions were chosen to perturb  specific growth rate ,  nutrient limitation, and  oxygen availability. each factor comprised at least two levels:  d =  <dig> / <dig> / <dig>  h- <dig>   carbon/nitrogen limitation, and  aerobiosis/anaerobiosis. because the specific growth rate  equals the dilution rate  in our chemostat experiments, the selected range covers cell doubling time  between  <dig>  and  <dig>  h /μ).

we first collected genome-wide transcription profiles from each steady-state using the affymetrix genechip platform. to reduce data dimensionality and explore the data structure, principal components analysis  was applied to the normalized microarray data . three main principal components were observed, comprising 69% of the variance . strikingly, the pca projections revealed that the three main principal components segregate the data along the three factors of our factorial design. the factor giving the greatest variance was oxygen availability . the second largest source of variability was observed for nutrient limitation , followed by dilution rate . while pc <dig> shows a clear separation between aerobic and anaerobic conditions, pc <dig> only distinctly separates the carbon and nitrogen limited conditions for the aerobic case. this is probably due to the fact that in the absence of oxygen only fermentative metabolism is possible, while both respirofermentative  and fully respiratory  metabolism may occur in aerobic conditions. the third factor, specific growth rate, also shows good groupings, although not as distinct as for the other factors . this is consistent with the transcriptome data from castrillo et al.  <cit> , in which c-limited cultivations were strongly segregated from the other nutrient limited conditions. notably, the high reproducibility of the replicates demonstrates the quality of our data.

functional analysis of the  <dig> growth rate dependent genes
to quantitatively reveal which genes had significantly changed expression, microarray analysis of variance  was carried out by using mixed-model and fs test . this test permitted the discovery of genes showing significant transcriptional changes with respect to each considered factor . table  <dig> shows the number of differently expressed genes for each of the three factors at different cut-off q-values. at a false discovery rate  of 2%, which was selected for further analysis, a total of  <dig> growth rate dependent genes were identified as significantly changed. to group genes with common expression profiles over the dilution rate range, the selected gene lists were clustered using hierarchical clustering . of the  <dig> significantly changed genes,  <dig> genes were up-regulated with increasing growth rate and  <dig> genes were down-regulated with increasing growth rate . the significantly changed genes are linearly correlated  with increasing growth rate . consistent with the pca analysis, the factor showing the most prominent segregation was oxygen availability. it is possible that this result, in part, reflects the distribution of experimental effort .

to determine significantly enriched gene ontology  process terms within the up-regulated and down-regulated growth rate dependent gene clusters, we used the saccharomyces genome database -go tools . among genes up-regulated with increasing growth rate, biosynthetic processes were the most significantly enriched . in particular, genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and assembly, translation, and protein biosynthesis were over-represented. nearly half of the up-regulated genes  encoded for components of the ribosome complex. these results suggest that faster growing cells build biomass more efficiently and are consistent with previous reports  <cit> .

gene hits indicate the number of genes in the clusters of up-/down-regulated genes belonging to that particular go term; the value is also given as percentage . p-values are provided as a score of significance .

among the  <dig> down-regulated genes, the most over-represented go terms were response to stress, carbohydrate metabolic process, and catabolic process . more specifically, genes encoding proteins involved in er associated protein catabolism , vacuole homeostasis , ubiquitin cycle  and ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism  show lower expression levels at higher specific growth rates. rpn <dig>  for example, regulates cellular levels of the proteasome  <cit> . while gene expression required for protein synthesis increases with increasing growth rate, gene expression required for protein degradation decreases. it is tempting to speculate that increased protein degradation processes at lower growth rates, typically under sub-optimal conditions, is a survival mechanism designed to more efficiently re-use possible resources.

strikingly, 11% of down-regulated genes have kinase activity , suggesting a possible role for phosphorylation in regulating the growth rate response. in addition, down-regulated genes having an unknown biological process  or function  were over-represented. the lack of annotation may be a result of these genes being expressed weakly under the rapid growth conditions used in most microarray experiments  <cit> .

to identify metabolites in yeast around which mrna expression changes are significantly associated, we applied the reporter metabolite algorithm  <cit>  . the most significant reporter metabolites are listed in table  <dig>  these metabolites participate in diverse metabolic pathways from nucleotide and amino acid metabolism, to phospholipid synthesis and the pentose phosphate pathway. orotate, for example, is involved in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleotides. a closer look revealed that ura <dig>  whose gene product catalyzes orotate phosphoribosyl transferase, was among the significantly up-regulated genes with increasing growth rate. ura <dig> is not regulated by pathway intermediates and our analysis suggests that transcriptional control of this critical enzyme involved in dna synthesis helps to mobilize resources necessary for growth. it is striking that atp, which participates in more reactions than any other metabolite  <cit> , is among the most significant reporter metabolites. this result suggests that gene expression of enzymes involved in atp production and consumption reactions is significantly regulated over changes in specific growth rate. in summary, the reporter metabolite results highlight the broad impact that growth rate has across metabolism.

reporter metabolite analysis  <cit>  identifies metabolites around which the most significant transcriptional changes occur. the number of neighbors indicates the number of genes whose products catalyze a reaction involving that particular metabolite. the algorithm took as input the maanova analysis referring to dilution rate effect. the p-value gives a measure of significance and all results <  <dig>  are reported.

transcription factor control of growth rate dependent genes
to identify and score tfs that might regulate the processes that control cell growth, we scored the significance of overlap between the  <dig> growth rate dependent genes and known tf target sets  <cit>  . in total, this analysis revealed  <dig> tfs having significantly enriched target sets  for genes up-regulated with increasing growth rate. fhl <dig>  rap <dig>  sfp <dig>  and yap <dig> are involved in regulating ribosomal protein gene expression. ace <dig> and swi <dig> participate in cell cycle regulation. yap <dig>  yap <dig>  smp <dig>  and pdr <dig> are involved in stress response and signaling. bas <dig> is involved in amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis, while stb <dig> and gat <dig> have unclear roles. the connectivity of tfs with enriched targets demonstrates how the global response of growth rate dependent genes may be controlled . sin <dig>  rap <dig>  swi <dig>  and swi <dig> appear to coordinate the response by linking protein synthesis, the cell cycle, and the stress response. no significant tfs were found when the same tf analysis was performed for the down-regulated genes.

target sets defined by harbison et al.  <cit>  chip-chip study. p-values <  <dig>  for ypd and other growth conditions are indicated . sets were also analyzed for beyer et al.  <cit>  derived target sets using sum of log-likelihood  >  <dig> 

fhl <dig>  rap <dig>  and sfp <dig> were the tfs with the greatest enrichment of growth-rate dependent target genes . these tfs are all involved in ribosomal protein  gene transcription. there are  <dig> rp genes in yeast, and their expression accounts for more than 50% of the rna pol ii dependent transcription  <cit> . rap <dig> participates in ribosomal gene expression  <cit>  and is involved in moving nucleosomes from a certain region of chromatin in order to allow fhl <dig> and ifh <dig> to trigger rp gene transcription  <cit> .

ace <dig> and swi <dig> are known cell cycle regulators  <cit>  and our tf enrichment analysis suggests a role for these two tfs in controlling growth rate, which remains a hypothesis. swi <dig> is part of the two heterodimeric transcriptional regulators sbf  and mbf   <cit> , that act in the early cell cycle . ace <dig>  instead, plays an important role during the m phase. previously, the effect of ace <dig> on the length of g <dig> phase has been reported by laabs et al.  <cit> , who demonstrated that a g <dig> specific delay in yeast daughter cells is due to this tf. little is known about stb <dig> : it binds to swi <dig>  <cit>  and a two-hybrid screen  <cit>  found that it binds to sin <dig>  we hypothesize that identification of stb <dig> as a principal regulating tf in our study, and the close association of it with swi <dig> and ace  <dig> , may hint at a possible role for stb <dig> in regulating the cell cycle.

highlighting the importance of both protein biosynthesis and cell cycle progression in controlling growth rate, sfp <dig> was also identified in the tf enrichment analysis. jorgensen et al.  <cit>  suggested that sfp <dig> activates rp gene transcription by influencing the nuclear localization of fhl <dig> and ifh <dig>  the tor and pka pathways, previously identified  <cit>  as critical in controlling growth rate, participate in keeping sfp <dig> in the nucleus  <cit> . sfp <dig> also modulates cell cycle progression in the late g <dig> phase  by controlling cell size in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . cell cycle progression in the late g <dig> phase  is dependent on the attainment of a critical cell size and critical translation rate  <cit> .

several identified tfs with significantly enriched targets are primarily involved in the stress response. yap <dig> regulates the expression of oxidative stress response genes  <cit> . chua et al.  <cit>  have indicated that yap <dig> overexpression induces genes involved in translation and trna metabolism. yap <dig> is known to have a role in salt tolerance  <cit>  and recently steinfeld et al.  <cit>  have indicated a role in regulation of sugar transport. pdr <dig> is a zinc finger transcription factor whose target genes carry out abc transport, other transport, and membrane lipid and cell wall biosyntheses  <cit> . we have previously proposed a role for pdr <dig> in dna damage response process and showed that yap <dig> and swi <dig> targets overlap significantly with pdr <dig> targets in absence of the damaging agent  <cit> .

in summary, the reporter metabolite and tf enrichment analyses both support the conclusion that in yeast changes in growth rates are associated with the regulation of protein synthesis, the cell cycle, and the stress response. for example, four tfs involved in regulation of protein synthesis genes are identified. in agreement, the reporter metabolite analysis identifies atp. thus, genes encoding products that catalyze reactions involving atp, and one of the most energy intensive processes of the cell, are observed as being significantly changed. in addition, identification of cell cycle regulators is consistent with results from reporter metabolite analysis suggesting that regulation of metabolic pathways of dna synthesis  have significant transcriptional changes.

comparison with previous growth rate studies
compared with earlier studies on the influence of the specific growth rate on global transcription, our analysis provides a much more moderate estimate of the number of growth rate dependent genes. this is likely due to two main reasons. first, the three-factor design employed here de-emphasizes genes that might be significant when oxygen availability is not considered. second, the statistical methods and significance thresholds among the studies are different. our previous study  <cit> , for example, found the largest number of growth rate dependent genes . however, that study used a newly developed consensus clustering algorithm to group similar genes that correlated with growth rate  <cit> . as another illustration, castrillo et al.  <cit>  identified about  <dig> growth rate dependent genes by performing analysis of covariance  and applying a q-value threshold of ≤  <dig>  for significance. at this threshold, their results are consistent with our findings . the number of genes specifically overlapping between the work of castrillo et al. and this study at a q-value threshold of  <dig>  is  <dig>  using our more conservative cut-off, the overlap is  <dig> 

given differences between experimental designs and approaches for determining growth rate dependent genes, it is perhaps not surprising that few common genes are observed among our results and the three previous studies . specifically,  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes were shared . among the common up-regulated genes,  <dig> were involved in translation  and  <dig> in sphingolipid biosynthesis . of common down-regulated genes,  <dig> had unknown process  and  <dig> were involved in regulation of the enzyme fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase, fbp <dig> . despite only a small overlap of specific genes among studies, significantly enriched go biological process terms identified the same overarching biological changes. considering the substantial variation between the different studies, our multi-factorial dataset is valuable for obtaining robust answers from queries on the effect of growth on transcription of different genes. due to our multi-factorial design, our dataset is also valuable for evaluation of e.g. the effect of nutritional state independent of growth rate and oxygen availability.

CONCLUSIONS
by increasing the number of experimental factors, we have identified a more conservative set of growth-rate dependent genes. specifically, our analysis has identified  <dig> specific growth rate dependent genes. results of a gene function analysis were found to be in agreement with previous studies  <cit> . new insight into the regulation of growth rate regulated genes has also been provided. specifically,  <dig> tfs have been identified as related to genes whose transcripts level increased with increasing growth rate and  <dig> of these are connected in a map of regulatory pathways supported by known protein-dna interactions. supported by the reporter metabolite analysis, the tfs that coordinate growth rate dependent genes are primarily involved in protein synthesis, the cell cycle, and the stress response. strikingly, down-regulated genes with increasing growth rate did not show common regulation, likely due to the high percentage of uncharacterized genes. we have shown that multi-factor designs, combined with a systems biology approach, can enhance our knowledge about yeast responses to growth rate. this approach will be valuable for studying any other environmental or genetic factor of interest.
