BACKGROUND
orf virus , the prototypic member of the parapoxviridae, is the cause of a papular demertitis in sheep and goats known as contagious ecthyma  <cit> . orfv has been used in veterinary medicine as a preventive and therapeutic immunomodulatory agent. live or inactivated orfv preparations exhibit dose-dependent immunomodulatory effects when administered to multiple animal species including cattle, horses, cats and dogs. significant therapeutic efficacy of orfv preparations in preventing or treating stress-associated and other infectious disease conditions has been well documented  <cit> . however, orfv functions  associated with modulation and manipulation of host immune responses are still poorly understood.

previously we identified  <dig> novel, mostly terminally located orfv genes with putative virulence and host range functions  <cit> , hypothesizing that these proteins perform novel but undescribed immunomodulatory functions in the host. to investigate the role of these genes during virus infection, one approach to studying uncharacterized genes is to create mutations and/or deletions of specific orfv genes to disrupt their function. this can be achieved by using transfer vectors designed to insert into site-specific locations of the viral genome via homologous recombination  <cit> . however, the experimental procedures to generate and isolate rorfvs are adapted from standard protocols used in generation of the vaccinia virus. this protocol is labor intensive and time consuming  <cit> .

the green fluorescent protein  was discovered by shimomura et al as a companion protein to aequorin  <cit> , the famous chemiluminescent protein from aequorea jellyfish which exhibits bright green fluorescence when exposed to blue light  <cit> . in cellular and molecular biology, the gfp gene is frequently used as a reporter of expression  <cit> . lately, the enhanced green fluorescent protein  was developed and has been introduced and expressed in many bacteria  <cit> , yeast and other fungi  <cit> , fish  <cit> , plants  <cit> , flies  <cit>  and mammalian cells  <cit>  including human. in recent years, recombinant gfp/egfp expression coupled with flow cytometry to produce an individual cell-based readout with increased sensitivity has been widely utilized to generate recombinant vaccinia viruses to study virus tropism and a high-throughput vaccinia virus neutralization assay  <cit> .

in the present study, to shorten the time required to generate rorfvs, we took advantage of egfp reporter gene as a selection marker to isolate rorfvs. the novel transfer vector pspv-egfp was constructed to express egfp in rorfvs. using this novel system, two single-gene deletion mutants ov-ia82Δ <dig> and ov-ia82Δ <dig> were successfully generated. this new approach allowed us to generate the desired rorfvs in less than  <dig> days. compared to the neo/gusa selection, egfp selection provides a direct, fast and convenient way to construct recombinant viruses, indicating the usefulness of the pspv-egfp vector.

RESULTS
generation of rorfvs using neo/gusa selection
to generate rorfvs, the convenient and efficient methods for identifying recombinants are necessary. in recent years, to improve the efficiency of recombinant isolation, the combination of drug selection and identifiable color detection provides an advantage over previous methods in the poxvirus field  <cit> . to investigate the functions of these novel genes encoded by orfv, construction of gene-deleted mutant viruses is a first step. in previous studies  <cit> , the pzippy-neo/gus vector containing the neo/gusa cassette was initially used to construct recombinant cassettes based on the flanking regions of orfv <dig>  orfv <dig>  orfv <dig>  orfv <dig>  orfv <dig>  orfv <dig> and orfv <dig>  the preliminary results were summarized in table  <dig>  using this strategy, four single gene deleted-mutant recombinants ov-ia82Δ <dig>  <cit> , ov-ia82Δ <dig>  <cit> , ov-ia82Δ <dig> , ov-ia82Δ <dig>  <cit>  were finally generated and isolated through  <dig> and  <dig> rounds of plaque purification . however, ov-ia82Δ <dig>  ov-ia82Δ <dig>  and ov-ia82Δ <dig> are still contaminated with the parent virus after more then  <dig> rounds of plaque purification . this protocol is labor intensive and time consuming, requiring at least  <dig> or  <dig> months to isolate and purify recombinants. a new strategy to generate rorfvs is critical.

construction of recombinant cassettes with the novel transfer vector pspv-egfp
to shorten the time needed to generate rorfvs, the novel transfer vector pspv-egfp  was constructed using the egfp reporter gene to replace the neo/gusa cassette  <cit> . to compare the efficiency of plaque purification between pzippy-neo/gusa  <cit>  and pspv-egfp, two orfv proteins, orfv <dig> and orfv <dig>  were used for this study. two transfer vectors, pspv-113lf-egfp-113rf and pspv-116lf-egfp-116rf, were constructed using pspv-egfp. these cassettes encode egfp under the control of the early-late vv  <dig>  promoter, which allows for isolation and purification of recombinant viruses by using fluorescent signals under a fluorescent microscope. this novel experimental strategy streamlines the procedure. the experimental steps in this new strategy include:  generating the ov-ia82Δ <dig> and ov-ia82Δ <dig> after transfection of the pspv-113lf-egfp-113rf and pspv-116lf-egfp-116rf vectors into ovine fetal turbinate  cells previously inoculated with ov-ia82;  visual monitoring of infected cultures by fluorescent microscopy to assess the level of rorfv infection;  determine the optimal time  to harvest cells for plaque assay .

generation of ov-ia82Δ <dig> and ov-ia82Δ <dig> using egfp selection
when the pspv-113lf-egfp-113rf and pspv-116lf-egfp-116rf vectors were transfected into oftu cells that had been previously exposed to ov-ia <dig> with  <dig>  multiplicity of infection , spots of brightly egfp-positive cells appeared within  <dig> h, and strong fluorescent signal was observed under fluorescent microscope after  <dig> h. cytopathic effect  of oftu cells infected with ov-ia82Δ <dig> or ov-ia82Δ <dig>  was observed after  <dig> h during the second round of limited dilution, and abundant egfp expression was observed in infected oftu cells. egfp-positive cells in 96-well plates with dilutions higher than 1: <dig>   <dig> were harvested for further plaque purification. after two rounds of limited dilutions, three different individual recombinant clones for each protein were selected to run  <dig> or  <dig> times plaque assays to remove parent virus contamination. plaques with a fluorescent signal can be identified in oftu cells after  <dig> h pi, and individual green plaques were picked under fluorescent microscope at  <dig> h pi . this demonstrates that egfp selection substantially shortens the time than conventional protocols such as neo/gusa selection.

identification of ov-ia82Δ <dig> and ov-ia82Δ116
to determine the purity of ov-ia82Δ <dig> and ov-ia82Δ <dig>  pcr was conducted using primers designed from internal coding regions of orfv <dig> and orfv <dig> or egfp . the results demonstrated that the egfp gene was amplified from three different clones of ov-ia82Δ <dig>  and ov-ia82Δ <dig> , but not from ov-ia <dig> or mock infected cells. in contrast, the orfv <dig> and orfv <dig> genes were amplified from ov-ia <dig> infected cells only .

* restriction enzyme sites are underlined in prime sequences

to verify orfv <dig> and orfv <dig> genes were successfully deleted from ov-ia <dig> via the transfer vector pspv-egfp and the egfp gene was incorporated into the ov-ia <dig> genome by homologous recombination; southern blot analysis was performed on genomic dna isolated from ov-ia <dig>  ov-ia82Δ <dig> and ov-ia82Δ <dig>  the orfv <dig> probe detected the orfv <dig> gene in ov-ia <dig>  but not in ov-ia82Δ <dig> . the orfv <dig> gene is the only double copy located at the left and right ends of the viral genome. the orfv <dig> probe detected the same pattern in both ov-ia <dig> and ov-ia82Δ <dig>  indicating that the deletion of orfv <dig> does not affect the left and right ends of the viral genome. the egfp probe detected the egfp gene in ov-ia82Δ <dig> but not in ov-ia <dig> . similar results were obtained when the orfv <dig> probe was applied . sequencing of left and right flanking regions of the deleted gene, which were involved in the recombination, confirmed the integrity of parental virus sequences in the mutant virus .

deletion of orfv <dig> and orfv <dig> do not affect orfv replication in vitro
to investigate the infectivity of the gene-deleted mutant viruses, a one-step growth curve was conducted. replication properties of ov-ia82Δ <dig>  ov-ia82Δ <dig>  and ov-ia <dig> were compared after infection of oftu cells. no significant differences in growth were detected between the mutant and wild type viruses  in oftu cells, indicating that orfv <dig> and orfv <dig> are not essential for orfv replication in oftu cells . the data also demonstrates that expression of egfp in ov-ia82Δ <dig> and ov-ia82Δ <dig> does not affect orfv growth and replication in vitro. also shown in our previous report  <cit> , the exogenous expression of egfp did not affect the viral phenotype and the biological function in orfv <dig> revertant virus  which was constructed by using the pspv-egfp system. taken together, the pspv-egfp vector could be widely used for recombination and foreign gene expression studies.

discussion
we have shown that generating rorfvs is easy and efficient using the egfp reporter gene and is faster than conventional neo/gusa methods. using this novel system, two single gene deletion mutants ov-ia82Δ <dig> and ov-ia82Δ <dig> were successfully generated. additional gene deletion mutants such as orfv <dig>  orfv <dig>  orfv <dig> and orfv <dig> are under way. the advantages of egfp fluorescent selection compared to conventional strategies are as follows:  easy to construct recombinant cassettes using the pspv-egfp;  visual monitoring of infected cells by fluorescent microscopy to assess the level of rorfv infection;  easy to determine the optimal time to harvest cells;  streamlining the procedures and shortening the time needed to isolate and purify the plaques , compared to  <dig> or  <dig> months using neo/gusa method ;  picking plaques directly under fluorescent microscope or by fluorescence activated cell sorting  within  <dig> h pi, no antibiotics and substrates needed;  using the pspv-egfp plus the pzippy-neo/gus allows to make a double gene deletion mutants for multiple copy genes or the same cluster of gene family. moreover, egfp expression in infected cells provides a reliable, straightforward methodology to maintain viral stocks free from contamination with spontaneous orfv revertants by the rapid selection marker of gfp-positive cells. furthermore, the growth curve demonstrate that egfp expression in recombinant viruses does not affect the virus replication  and the luciferase assay results of our previous reported ov-ia82rv002gfp  <cit>  also showed that the egfp expression does not affect the virus biological functions. previous studies have shown that recombinant vaccinia virus-mediated egfp expression has been used to monitor infection in vitro  <cit>  or in vivo  <cit> . our egfp-based vector construct may represent a practical tool to study orfv infection and pathogenesis in natural hosts.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, the pspv-egfp vector, which contains two mcss for insertion orfv genes or foreign genes, provides a reliable, straightforward methodology for the advanced studies of orfv replication, host range, as well as foreign gene expression. using this new approach to generate and isolate rorfvs based on the egfp selection marker remarkably reduces the time for recombinant virus isolation and purification. in addition, egfp localization will give the opportunity to study host-virus interaction at the cellular level in vivo. taken together, the novel transfer vector pspv-egfp provides an efficient and convenient way for gene deletion from ov-ia <dig> genome to study the novel gene functions and may also be used to acquire gene-deleted mutants from other viruses.
