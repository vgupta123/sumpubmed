BACKGROUND
enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli  of serotype o157:h <dig> has been implicated in foodborne illnesses worldwide. it frequently causes large outbreaks of severe enteric infections including bloody diarrhoea, hemorrhagic colitis  and haemolytic uremic syndrome   <cit> . this serotype constitutively expresses the somatic   <dig> and flagellar   <dig> antigens, thus, these traits are used extensively in clinical settings to identify this highly pathogenic serotype  <cit> . however some o157:h <dig> strains, although being genotipically o <dig> or h <dig> do not express either of those antigens  <cit> . according to the latest cdc report, e. coli o157:h <dig> infections affect thousands of people every year accounting for  <dig> %, 4% and  <dig> %, of illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths, respectively of the total u.s. foodborne diseases caused by all known foodborne pathogens  <cit> .

previously, we characterized two potentially pathogenic o rough:h <dig> strains that did not express the o <dig> antigen  <cit>  but belonged to the most common o157:h <dig> clonal type. the o rough phenotype was found to be due to two independent is <dig> insertions in the gne gene that encodes for an epimerase enzyme essential for synthesis of an oligosaccharide subunit in the o antigen. of the is elements identified in o <dig> strains, is <dig> elements are the most prevalent in this serotype and have been confirmed to very actively transpose in o <dig> genomes  <cit> . the presence of o-rough strains of this serotype in food and clinical samples is of concern as they cannot be detected serologically in assays routinely used to test for o157:h <dig>  <cit> .

the occurrence of other atypical o157:h <dig> strains due to is <dig> insertions therefore, might be more common than anticipated. it is generally assumed that is elements play important roles in bacterial genome evolution and in some cases are known contributors to adaptation and improved fitness  <cit> . the acquisition or loss of mobile genetic elements, like is elements, may differ between strains of a particular bacterial species  <cit> . is insertion and is-mediated deletions have been shown to generate phenotypic diversity among closely related o <dig> strains  <cit> . it has been shown that o <dig> is a highly diverse group and a major factor that effects this diversity are prophages  <cit> . however, in addition to prophages, is <dig> also appears to be a major contributor to genomic diversification of o <dig> strains. therefore, it is questionable how much influence is <dig> had on the evolution of o157:h <dig>  or how much importance is <dig> has to changes in virulence in this bacterium.

it has been proposed in an evolutionary model previously that highly pathogenic enterohemorrhagic e. coli  o157:h <dig> arose from its ancestor enteropathogenic e. coli  o55:h <dig>  through sequential acquisition of virulence, phenotypic traits, and serotypic change /a <dig> in figure 1a)  <cit> . after the somatic antigen change from o <dig> to o <dig> gave rise to an intermediary  which has not yet been isolated, two separate o <dig> clonal complexes evolved, splitting into two diverged clonal groups. one of these groups was composed of sorbitol fermenting  non-motile o157:nm strains containing plasmid psfo <dig>  . the other was composed of non-sorbitol fermenting  o157:h <dig> strains containing plasmid po <dig>  . the latter, by a mutational inactivation of the uida gene, lost its β-glucuronidase activity which is the most typical o157:h <dig> phenotype at present   <cit> . these a <dig> strains have spread geographically into disparate locales and now account for most of the diseases caused by ehec  <cit> .

is <dig> seems to play an important role in the diversification of closely related strains, specifically o157:h <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, we examined the prevalence of is <dig> in a panel of e. coli strains, including ancestral and atypical strains associated with the stepwise emergence of e. coli o157:h <dig> to determine the prevalence of is <dig> and its impact on the transitional steps that gave rise to today's highly pathogenic e. coli o157:h <dig> 

RESULTS
is <dig> prevalence in e. coli o157:h <dig> genomes
the is <dig> sequence, recently found to be inserted into the gne gene in e. coli o rough:h <dig>   <cit> , was used for a blast analysis of the genomes of  <dig> e. coli o157:h <dig> strains belonging to a <dig> cc  and one o55:h <dig> strain  . the blast analysis for is <dig> showed the presence of between  <dig> and  <dig> copies in each strain along with their corresponding plasmid . strains sakai and edl <dig> shared  <dig> of those is <dig> on the chromosome and three on their po <dig> plasmids. strains ec <dig> and tw <dig> had  <dig> is <dig> on the chromosome and four on their po <dig> plasmid in common. the analysis of the recently released e. coli o55:h <dig> genome strain cb <dig>  <cit>  allowed for identification of one is <dig> with an internal  <dig> bp deletion on the chromosome and an is <dig> in its corresponding po <dig> plasmid. neither the o <dig> genomic  nor the po <dig> plasmid is <dig> insertion sites were present in other o157:h <dig> strains. the absence of the po <dig> is <dig> insertion site in o157:h <dig> strains was expected since they do not carry the po <dig> plasmid. however, lack of the genomic o <dig> is <dig> insertion site in o157:h <dig> strains is interesting as these strains are known to be closely related  <cit> . contrary to what was observed for plasmids po <dig> and po <dig>  is <dig> was absent in plasmid psfo <dig> . however, a  <dig> bp sequence identical to is <dig> was observed in the plasmid which could be a remnant of is <dig>  no genomic sequence is available for an o157:h- strain at this time, thus, this strain could not be investigated for the presence of is <dig> 

tr* - truncated.

is <dig> target site specificity  on chromosomes and plasmids of four e. coli o157:h <dig> strains
the majority of is <dig> elements were located on prophages or prophage-like elements  . 28% of is <dig> locations were found on the well-conserved  <dig> -mb sequence widely regarded as the e. coli chromosome backbone   <cit>  and 10% were located on the po <dig> plasmid. in total, we observed  <dig> different is <dig> insertion sites  in the four e. coli chromosomes and plasmids by "in silico" analysis . seven of  <dig> is <dig> insertion were shared among the  <dig> diverged strains which suggest that they were also present in a common ancestor.

is <dig> presence in strains belonging to the stepwise model of emergence of e. coli o157:h7
a total of  <dig> e. coli strains  belonging to the stepwise model proposed by feng et al.  were examined by pcr for the presence of is <dig> using specific primers  <cit> . every strain of clonal complex  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> carried is <dig>  except strain 3256- <dig> belonging to the ancestral cc a <dig> . strikingly, however, was the observation that is <dig> was absent in the sfo <dig> strains belonging to the closely related cc a <dig> . whole genome analysis of two a <dig> strains  confirmed the absence of this specific is element in sfo <dig> strains  <cit> . on the other hand, o55:h <dig> strain 3256- <dig>  carried a truncated is <dig> version missing the target area for the reverse primer  located in orfb, explaining the lack of is <dig> by pcr  <cit> . additionally, strains usda <dig>  and tb182a  as well as strain lsu- <dig>  appear to harbor a truncated is <dig> which could indicate the presence of genomic is <dig> found in the o <dig> strain cb <dig>  however, since no additional ancestral strains were available for analysis, the distribution of is <dig> in these groups is at present inconclusive.

is <dig> distribution in strains belonging to the stepwise model of emergence of e. coli o157:h7
we successfully pcr amplified  <dig> of the  <dig> observed is <dig> insertion sites in the  <dig> o157:h <dig> strains analyzed . we determined presence or absence of an is <dig> element as well as the is <dig> target site in each strain . in accordance with the previous finding of total absence of is <dig> in sfo <dig>  none of the a <dig> cc strains harbored an is <dig> in any of the known is <dig> insertion sites. likewise, it was observed for a <dig> and a <dig> cc strains, indicating that the previously detected is <dig> must be located in some other region of the chromosome. in a <dig> cc strains, only  <dig> of the  <dig>  is <dig> insertion sites harbored an is <dig> . those sites were located on the prophage sp <dig>  the prophage-like element sple <dig>  and on the chromosomal backbone. interestingly one of the a <dig> cc strains  did not share any of the known sites harboring is <dig>  the a <dig> cc strains shared between  <dig>  and  <dig>  is <dig> insertions in the known sites and two of them  were present in all a <dig> cc strains. is <dig> prevalence in the a <dig> strains and the distribution amongst sp, sple, backbone and the po <dig> plasmids did not show any specific pattern, however it appears that is <dig> transposes actively in the a <dig> cc.

is <dig> insertion site prevalence in the strains belonging to the stepwise model of emergence of e. coli o157:h7
pcr analysis for the presence of is <dig> insertion sites showed that sites located on the chromosomal backbone structure were present in all tested strains from the different clonal complexes . however, neither a <dig>  a <dig>  nor a <dig> cc strains harbored any is <dig> in backbone is <dig> insertion sites.

na, not applicable; + presence; - absence; +/- present in some strains.

contrary to what was observed in the well-conserved backbone, is <dig> insertion sites in prophages and prophage-like elements in different strains were found to be highly variable . as seen for the backbone is <dig> insertion sites, some of the phage associated is <dig> insertions sites were present in a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> cc strains; however they lacked is <dig>  many of the is <dig> sites on phages were unique to the a <dig> cc strains  suggesting that they are strain-specific. this result underscores significant differences in the presence of phage-related sequences between the strains belonging to the stepwise model of e. coli o157:h <dig> 

sp - phage; sple - phage-like element; na - not applicable; + presence; - absence.

the two is <dig> insertions in o <dig> and its corresponding plasmid po <dig> were observed to be present in only one ancestral a <dig> and both a <dig> cc strains . a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig> cc strains as well as a <dig> cc strain 3256- <dig>  lacked the is <dig> insertion site in these regions. interestingly, strain lsu- <dig> which carries multiple characteristics for o157:h <dig> and is thought to be ancestral to a <dig> cc strains , appeared to carry the truncated genomic is <dig> insertion.

since the strains belonging to the stepwise model share variable is <dig> insertion sites we reconstructed their evolutionary path using this information. a parsimony tree using the is <dig> target sites presence/absence produced a tree that was nearly analogous to the proposed model of stepwise evolution for o157:h <dig> from ancestral o55:h <dig> strains  <cit> , with a1/a <dig> cc strains at the base of the tree, followed by a <dig> cc, a <dig> cc and a <dig> cc strains in that order .

phylogenetic analysis of is <dig> elements in the four e. coli o157:h <dig> and o55:h <dig> genomes
the phylogenetic analysis of is <dig> elements revealed that is <dig> in e coli o157:h <dig> can be divided into three different sub-types . that is, is <dig> of sub-type i and ii differ in average 4%  while sub-type ii and iii differed by 5% . sub-type i appears to be most closely related to those of is <dig>  found in o111:h-  <cit> . is <dig> sub-type ii appears to be most closely related to those of is <dig> found in shigella  <cit> . is <dig> sub-type iii appears to be most closely related to those of is <dig> found in e. coli o26:h <dig>  <cit> . therefore, analysis of all targeted is <dig> elements showed that strains from a <dig> cc seem to carry both is <dig>  and is <dig>  whereby the ancestral o55:h <dig> strain carries is <dig> . since is <dig> sub-type ii found in the ancestral o55:h <dig> strain is significantly different from the other two is <dig> sub-types  and sub-type ii is no longer present in certain o157:h <dig> strains , these data imply that is <dig> sub-type i and iii were recently acquired by e. coli o157:h <dig> strains after the separation from the sub-lineage leading to the a <dig> cc strains therefore not carrying is <dig> 

discussion
is elements are in general regarded as genetic factors that significantly contribute to genomic diversification and evolution  <cit> . it was determined by ooka et al  that is elements is <dig> and isec <dig>  found in the o157:h <dig> lineage, serve as an important driving force behind the genomic diversity. however, only a few genome-wide studies have been conducted to compare is distributions in closely related genomes. in our study we determined that is <dig> insertions in e. coli o157:h <dig> are widespread distributed on the genome and differ significantly from strain to strain. although the ancestral o55:h <dig> strain carried only two is <dig> with one on the chromosome and one on the po <dig> plasmid, the four o157:h <dig> genomes carried between  <dig> and  <dig> is <dig> copies on the chromosome and the corresponding po <dig> plasmid.

is <dig> does not seem to specifically integrate in sequence-based target sites, which explains the highly diverged flanking sites found in the genomes we examined. sequence-specific insertion is exhibited to some degree by several elements and varies considerably in stringency  <cit> . other elements exhibit regional preferences which are less obvious to determine  <cit> . is elements frequently generate short target site duplication  flanking the is upon insertion  <cit> --this feature was also observed for is <dig> in the four o157:h <dig> strains. is <dig> duplicated between  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs at the insertion site and was observed for  <dig> of the  <dig> is <dig> insertion sites with matching identical base pairs up- and down-stream of is <dig>  a comparison of  <dig> tsds created by is <dig> in the four strains analyzed here did not reveal as many similarities as observed previously by ooka et al . the comparison of  <dig> bp up- and downstream of each insertion site did not show any similarities or patterns which would have suggested a target preference or "hot-spot" for is <dig> insertions. hence, insertion site specificity for is <dig> remains unknown. however, is <dig> is frequently surrounded by other is elements  and was found in the same gene  inserted in different sites  <cit> . although no specific "hot-spot" for is <dig> insertions was observed, it seems highly possible that mobile elements like plasmids, phages or phage-like elements could have functioned as vectors for is <dig> introduction into o157:h <dig> genomes. these observations suggest that an insertion might occur preferentially in a region of the chromosome however these events may not be sequence specific.

is <dig> insertion sites located on the backbone seem to be conserved in almost all of the strains studied here, whereby sites located on phages and phage-like areas appear to differ between all strains. these findings affirm the presence of regions of genomic stability and regions of genomic variability that exist within o157:h <dig> populations and closely related strains. it is noteworthy that sites associated with phages seem to be present predominantly in closely related strains. the majority of the phages present in the a <dig> cc strains appear to be unique to this complex. since bacteriophages are known to contribute to the diversification of bacteria  <cit> , they seem to be a major determinant in generating diversity among o55:h <dig>  o157:h- and o157:h <dig> strains. the comparison of is <dig> prevalence in a <dig> and a <dig> cc as well as is <dig> insertion site prevalence in all strains allowed distinguishing strains from different complexes as it has been proposed in the evolution model for o157:h <dig>   <cit> . adding the "same" strain from different collections, sakai and edl <dig> allowed confirmation of the stability of is <dig> sites. minimal changes in is <dig> presence/absence were observed and could have occurred due to different storage conditions and passages. despite these subtle changes, strains grouped tightly together on the parsimony tree. therefore, this analysis can be used to further distinguish closely related o157:h <dig> strains. these findings are in agreement with a recently described is <dig> analysis in three o <dig> lineages  <cit> . similarly to what was determined for a <dig> and a <dig> cc strains, yokoyama et al  determined that is <dig> distribution was biased in different o <dig> lineages, indicating the potential effectiveness of is-printing for population genetics analysis of o <dig>  furthermore, ooka et al.  found that is-printing can resolved about the same degree of diversity as pfge. since a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> cc strains did not share is <dig> insertions, their population genetics analysis however, remains limited to closely related o157:h <dig> strains.

comparison of is629s found in o157:h <dig> and o <dig> pointed out extensive divergence between these elements. at least three different is <dig> types could be distinguished differing in  <dig> to  <dig> bp. the o157:h <dig> strains carry is <dig> elements subtype i and iii whereby o55:h <dig> carries type ii only. it is notable that only four nucleotide differences were observed among seven housekeeping genes comprising a current mlst scheme http://www.shigatox.net/ecmlst/cgi-bin/dcs between a <dig> cc strain dec5a and a <dig> cc strain sakai. these two strains, in particular, are taken to represent the most ancestral and most derived e. coli, respectively, in the stepwise evolutionary model for this pathogen. if the is <dig> type i and iii observed in a <dig> cc strains resulted from divergent evolution of is <dig> type ii, the amount of changes observed among these is types should be similar to those observed for the mlst loci examined above. however, the number of nucleotide substitutions between is <dig> type i and iii in o157:h <dig> from type ii in o55:h <dig> was 10-fold higher. thus, the differences between is <dig> types are more significant than those observed for housekeeping genes. this indicates that is629-type ii was most likely lost and is629-type i and iii were acquired independently in distinct e. coli o157:h <dig> lineages. further supporting this thesis was the fact that one of the is <dig> type ii copies was found on the po <dig> plasmid, which was subsequently lost during evolution towards o157:h <dig> strains. the other is <dig> copy in o <dig>  with a unique internal deletion, is located in the chromosome and appears to be part of a mobile region  <cit>  which is absent in o157:h <dig> strains.

interestingly, the ancestral is629-deficient a <dig> o55:h <dig> strain 3256- <dig> is also lacking both is <dig> associated regions found in the o55:h <dig> strains. our analysis of common is <dig> target sites demonstrated that strain 3256- <dig> seems to be more closely related to a <dig> and a <dig> cc strains than other a <dig> and a <dig> strains. therefore, it is likely that is <dig> has been lost in strain 3256- <dig> as well as in the hypothetical a <dig> precursor. these results may indicate that strain 3256- <dig> or a similar strain lacking is <dig> might have given rise to is629-deficient a <dig> cc strains.

e. coli o157:h <dig> strains carry multiple is <dig> copies while the non-pathogenic k- <dig> strain lacks is <dig> but carries other is elements. other pathogenic e. coli strains, amongst the top six non-o <dig> stec o26:h <dig>  o111:h- and o103:h <dig>  <cit> , also harbor various copies of is <dig> elements in their genomes. genome sequences for the other three most important pathogenic non-o <dig> stec; o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig> are not available to date thus the presence of is <dig> elements is unknown. interestingly, they also share the same reservoir with o157:h <dig> , shiga-toxins, haemolysin gene cluster, other virulence factors and several phages and phage-like elements  <cit> . ooka et al  postulated that is-related genomic rearrangements may have significantly altered virulence and other phenotypes in o <dig> strains. these findings suggest that is <dig> might not only have a great impact in their genomic evolution but might increase the pathogenicity of those strains as well.

CONCLUSIONS
the genomic sequence analysis showed that is <dig> insertion sites exhibited a highly biased distribution. is <dig> was much more frequently located on phages or prophage-like elements than in the well-conserved backbone structure, which is consistent with the observations by ooka et al . is <dig> was found to be present in the a <dig> and one of two a <dig> cc strains examined as well as in all the o157:h <dig> strains of a <dig> and a <dig> cc, however it was totally absent in the  <dig> examined sfo <dig> strains of a <dig> cc. the a <dig> cc strains are related to but on a divergent evolution pathway from o157:h <dig>  these results suggest that the absence of is <dig> in a <dig> strains probably occurred during the divergence, but it is uncertain if it contributed to the divergence. overall, is <dig> had great impact on the genomic diversification of the e. coli o157:h <dig> lineage and might have contributed in the emergence of the highly pathogenic o157:h <dig>
