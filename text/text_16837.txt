BACKGROUND
hematophagy, blood-feeding, is a behavior exhibited by most arthropod vectors of human pathogens. in anautogenous mosquitoes, the female generally feeds to repletion on a single blood meal and then proceeds to use this nutrition as the basis for the development of a batch of eggs. the cycle of host seeking, blood feeding, egg development, and oviposition is generally called the gonotrophic cycle, a term coined by beklemishev in  <dig>  <cit> . for most mosquitoes living in optimal field or laboratory conditions, this cycle requires about forty-eight hours and involves a complex series of biological events, including peritrophic matrix formation, blood digestion, oocyte development, vitellogenesis, and excretion.

digestion of the proteinaceous blood meal is required for oocyte development and vitellogenesis, and consequently these are coordinated processes. multiple hormones interact to alter tissue states and to activate genes involved in these processes. the two hormones juvenile hormone  and 20-hydroxyecdysone  are most fundamental to ovarian development. within several days after emergence of female mosquitoes from the puparium, juvenile hormone  stimulates the separation of ovarian follicles from germaria and limited growth of the ovarian follicle to its pre-vitellogenic resting state  <cit> . jh also confers competence to fat body cells and ovarian follicles for uptake of ecdysteroidogenic hormone . then, in response to a blood meal, gonadotrophins are released from cerebral neurosecretory cells and cause the ovaries to become oeh-responsive  <cit> . oeh stimulates the ovaries to secrete ecdysone, the precursor to 20-e, as well as 20-e during vitellogenesis  <cit> . fat body cells take up ecdysone, convert it to 20-e and use it to activate transcription of vitellogenin genes  <cit> , the genes encoding the major egg-yolk proteins, as well as a large number of other genes, many of whose products will be incorporated into eggs .

prior to the blood meal, female mosquitoes access sugars for nutritional sustenance. during the first several hours following a blood meal, the mosquito undergoes physiological changes in addition to hormonal ones. acquisition of a blood meal stimulates midgut proteolytic activity such that approximately 80% of the protein content is digested within one day  <cit> . serine proteases including trypsins and chymotrypsins are responsible for the majority of endoproteolytic activity  <cit> . the role of trypsins in blood digestion has been well documented in aedes aegypti, and more recently it has been investigated in an. gambiae. despite the digestive proteolysis peak at  <dig> hours post blood meal, digestive enzymes exhibit two phases of transcription  <cit> . in ae. aegypti there are three trypsins, early trypsin, which is constitutively expressed prior to blood feeding and two late trypsins which are blood induced. these two types of trypsins are also found in an. gambiae. the an. gambiae trypsin family includes seven genes clustered within  <dig> kb on chromosome 3r, in division 30a, that encode five functional proteins  <cit> . trypsins  <dig> and  <dig> are both induced by a blood meal and exhibit similar expression profiles. in contrast to trypsins  <dig> and  <dig>  trypsins  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are constitutively expressed in unfed females  <cit> . trypsins  <dig> and  <dig> are down-regulated following a blood meal and not expressed again at levels detectable by rt-pcr until  <dig> hours post blood meal  <cit> . in addition to the trypsins, three chymotrypsin genes have been isolated and characterized in an. gambiae, two of which are located in tandem on chromosome 2l, in division 25d  <cit> . both of these genes, anchym  <dig> and  <dig>  are expressed in the midgut by  <dig> hours post blood meal and their transcripts are abundant until  <dig> hours, as determined by pcr, unlike the levels of trypsins  <dig> and  <dig> that have decreased dramatically by this time  <cit> . in contrast, the other characterized chymotrypsin, agchyl, exhibits transcript level changes more similar to those of trypsins 3– <dig>  <cit> .

two types of exopeptidases, carboxypeptidases and aminopeptidases, have been characterized in anopheline mosquitoes. edwards et al.  <cit>  cloned a carboxypeptidase that was rapidly induced in an. gambiae midguts following blood meal ingestion. multiple aminopeptidases have been isolated from hematophagous insects, and it has been suggested that they may play different roles in digestion  <cit> . additional enzymes including glycosidases and lipases are also required for the digestion of non-proteinaceous blood constituents  <cit> .

in addition to dramatic changes in physiology, blood feeding also induces changes in mosquito morphology. following gut distension by blood ingestion, midgut epithelial cells secrete a type i peritrophic matrix  that is continuous along the length of the midgut  <cit> . prior to the blood meal, the midgut epithelial cells contain high concentrations of apically located, morphologically granular, secretory vesicles. presumably these apical granules contain precursors of the peritrophic matrix: as early as an hour after the adult female has taken a blood meal, they are no longer detectable . in an. gambiae, the pm can be visualized by electron microscopy as early as  <dig> hours pbm and it is fully formed by  <dig> hours pbm  <cit> . the pm is a biochemically complex structure containing not only chitin and other proteoglycans, but as many as 20– <dig> different proteins  <cit> . however, only one gene encoding a peritrophic matrix protein has been cloned in an. gambiae  <cit> . the exact functions of the pm remain unknown, but it has been suggested that this semi-permeable porous structure may function as a restrictive layer protecting the midgut epithelium from proteolytic digestive enzymes, from haematin crystals that form following hemoglobin breakdown and as a barrier to blood-borne pathogens including bacteria and malaria parasites .

once the adult mosquito acquires a blood meal, she spends approximately  <dig> hours converting about 20% of it into egg constituents  <cit> , using another fraction of it to support the intense biosynthetic activities of this period and defecating the rest. oogenesis in the mosquito ovary actually begins post-eclosion but oocyte growth attenuates at a resting stage until blood meal ingestion. once reinitiated, egg development continues until oviposition. successful egg production not only requires ovarian events for development and maturation of oocytes, but also synthesis of yolk constituents, both protein and lipid, in the fat body, followed by their uptake by oocytes and storage for later use during embryogenesis. collectively, the events of yolk synthesis, uptake and storage constitute the process of vitellogenesis  <cit> . vitellogenesis and oogenesis require the coordination of molecular events in at least these two different abdominal tissues, the fat body and ovary. based on morphological and physiological criteria, the ovarian cycle can be divided into four phases: 1) pre-vitellogenic, 2) initiation, 3) trophic, and 4) post-trophic phase  <cit> .

the meroistic ovary of an. gambiae contains approximately  <dig> functional egg-production structures, the ovarioles. each ovariole is comprised of two parts, a distal germarium and a vitellarium proximal to a common oviduct through which eggs will pass as they are laid. in the germarium, mitosis of the primordial germ cells creates a syncitium with an oocyte and seven nurse cells interconnected by intracellular bridges, or ring canals as a result of incomplete cytokinesis. both the germ cell and the nurse cells are surrounded by a somatically derived follicular epithelium  <cit> . the first pre-vitellogenic phase is completed within three days of eclosion and ends with the separation of these follicles from the germaria and entry into the vitellaria. at the end of this phase, oocytes may have undergone some growth but then arrest until events initiated by acquisition of a blood meal cause them to become competent for ovarian vitellogenic events.

ingestion of a blood meal reinitiates ovarian development and follicle growth resumes. in ae. aegypti and anopheles albimanus, this period appears variable, lasting 3– <dig> and 8– <dig> hours, respectively, and ends with the initiation of vitellogenin synthesis  <cit> . in the next two days, during the trophic phase, the mosquito generates large amounts of vitellogenin, the secreted precursor to the major yolk protein vitellin. in addition to vitellogenin, the developing oocytes also accumulate other proteins, and lipids from the hemolymph, as well as ribosomes and mrnas synthesized in the syncitial nurse cells. these latter constituents are transported to the germ cell through the ring canals connecting the oocytes and nurse cells by a process of cytoplasmic streaming  <cit> . following delivery, several maternal mrnas become localized within the oocyte. these maternal transcripts are fundamental for dorsal/ventral and anterior/posterior patterning of the embryo that will develop from the oocyte. this pattern of deposition and the patterning of the eggshell also depend on a complex signaling process involving both the somatic cells of the follicular epithelium and the oocyte.

once oocyte growth has ceased, vitellogenin synthesis terminates. this signals the onset of the post-trophic phase. during this time, the oocytes mature and eggshell structures begin to develop. the chorion, part of the eggshell, is secreted by the follicular epithelium and contains two layers, the first secreted, inner endochorion and the later secreted, outer exochorion  <cit> . it is the endochorionic layer that will harden and melanize after oviposition.

specialization of eggshell structures necessitates communication between cells. the ras  <dig> signaling cascade is an important means of communication during the processes of oocyte and eggshell patterning, as it is during eye development and differentiation of structures late in embryogenesis  <cit> . during patterning in drosophila, developing oocytes produce the tgfα protein gurken that binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor , a receptor tyrosine kinase  localized to the posterior follicle cells, to initiate ras  <dig> signaling. downstream from the activation of this rtk, the gtp-binding protein ras  <dig> initiates a series of enzymatic events propagated successively by three protein kinases, raf, mapk, and mapk kinase , resulting in the translocation of nuclear factors and possibly the concomitant reorganization of the cytoskeleton . thus, a cascade of events leads to the establishment of the posterior follicle cell fate. the posterior follicle cells then signal back to the germ cells. this results in the reorganization of the oocyte cytoskeleton, and regulates the localization of anterior/posterior determinants. similar to the eggshell, the oocyte also undergoes dorsal-ventral patterning. following patterning of the follicle cells, maternal gene products are regulated by the toll signaling pathway to generate a transcription factor gradient that will spatially regulate activity of specific zygotic genes within the fertilized oocytes  <cit> .

vitellogenic events in the fat body have also been divided into phases: 1) pre-vitellogenic, 2) vitellogenic, and 3) termination. the pre-vitellogenic phase in the fat body coincides with the pre-vitellogenic phase of the ovarian cycle. during this phase, rna synthesis increases in the fat body and the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi complex proliferate to prepare for the production of vitellogenin. at the start of the vitellogenic phase, the release of mosquito hormones initiated by digestion signal the onset of vitellogenesis  <cit> . synthesis of large amounts of vitellogenins is facilitated by the large quantities of biosynthetic machinery generated during pre-vitellogenic stages, but also depends on the presence of multiple vitellogenin genes . following synthesis, vitellogenin is released into the hemolymph and eventually diffuses through channels between the cells of the follicular epithelium, whereupon it is accumulated by the oocytes by a process of receptor-mediated endocytosis in clathrin-coated pits  <cit> . when vitellogenesis has ceased, during the termination phase, the biosynthetic machinery in the fat body is degraded via a lysosomal pathway, at least in ae. aegypti  <cit> .

thus, blood feeding initiates a complex series of physiological events in at least three tissues that are integrated by the actions of jh, 20-e and peptide hormones. these events may be required for parasite development; they certainly can be modulated by the presence of parasites  <cit>  and may provide points of intervention for mosquito control. microarray analysis provides a tool to study global expression patterns of thousands of genes simultaneously. by comparing the level of transcription of a gene over time between two states, e.g. blood-fed vs. sugar-fed, an expression signature for each gene can be defined in response to blood feeding. consequently, these expression patterns may indicate how these genes are regulated and interact, and also the biological processes in which the act. in this study we performed microarray analysis of genes in female mosquito abdomens during the first  <dig> hours after a blood meal. we have implicated many of these genes in different processes stimulated de novo by blood feeding. the elucidation of the expression profiles of abdominal genes will provide a broadened basis for understanding vector-parasite interactions. our study certainly provides insights into the physiology of the malaria vector anopheles gambiae.

RESULTS
array composition
microarray analysis was conducted on  <dig> cdna clones generated from three different adult female an. gambiae mosquito abdomen-derived cdna libraries to elucidate major patterns of gene expression through  <dig> hours post ingestion of a blood meal. arrays were constructed from triplicate spotted negative controls , positive controls for blood-fed samples consisting of  <dig> clones whose ests corresponded to rat  α and β hemoglobin chains, and pcr-amplified fragments obtained from  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> clones randomly picked from the sugar-fed , rat blood-fed , and p. berghei infected rat blood-fed  abdomen libraries, respectively . approximately 84% of pcr-amplified fragments were visualized on ethidium bromide stained 1% agarose,  <dig> × tbe gels prior to spotting . of these pcr-amplified fragments,  <dig> clones  were represented by a single defined band .

note: pcr-amplified fragments were visualized on ethidium bromide stained 1% agarose,  <dig> × tbe gels. approximately 13% of pcr products could not be visualized following the first amplification due to product yield below the threshold of ethidium bromide detection; 54% of these  were re-amplified.

ests corresponding to these spotted cdnas were screened for mitochondrial contamination, filtered based on sequence trace file quality, and assembled  using the dnastar seqman ii software  . the high quality ests clustered into  <dig> contigs  and  <dig> singletons  for a total of  <dig> unique transcripts .

note: est analysis includes the ests of the positive controls .

note: est assembly includes the ests of the positive controls .

microarray and bioinformatic analyses
global patterns of greater than two-fold up-regulation or down-regulation for these cdnas were established by comparing transcript levels in blood-fed an. gambiae adult females at ten time points during and post ingestion of a blood meal to the levels in sugar-fed females. first strand cdna was generated from total rna collected at  <dig> min and  <dig> min after initiation of blood feeding and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hr post-blood meal. all cdna populations were labeled and hybridized to arrays. for each pcr-amplified insert, cy <dig> and cy <dig> fluorescent dye levels were measured from  <dig> replicate spots on each of  <dig> arrays to generate average signal intensities, and an expression ratio depicting transcript fold change between sugar-fed and blood-fed mosquitoes calculated. following quality control filtering and normalization,  <dig> cdnas and the rat β-hemoglobin gene, the positive control, were expressed more than twofold above or below control, sugar-fed levels at one or more of the  <dig> blood-feeding time points. following est analysis, the  <dig> cdnas were found to represent  <dig> unique mosquito transcripts,  <dig> of which were present in more than one set. this anomaly is due to est clustering of alternatively spliced transcripts with different expression patterns. more unique transcripts are up-regulated than down-regulated in response to blood feeding, while 10% of them are both up-regulated and down-regulated over the time course of this study:  <dig> are up-regulated at least twofold,  <dig> are down-regulated at least twofold, and  <dig> are down-regulated and up-regulated. bioinformatic analyses of these  <dig> unique transcripts showed that all sequences shared sequence identity with the an. gambiae genome , 90% of which shared sequence identity with an entry in nr of dbest . in this analysis blast hits with an e value ≤ <dig> × 10- <dig> were considered significant.

microarray gene clustering and principal components analysis
the behaviors of the gene products identified as at least twofold up/down-regulated were grouped into three sets using k-means clustering  and named according to the time of their induction during the 48-hour time course following the initiation of blood feeding. set  <dig>  hereafter referred to as the "early genes", contains  <dig> unique transcripts derived from  <dig> cdnas, which are expressed mainly during the early time points . the majority of these genes are appear induced at least twofold more abundantly than in sugar-fed mosquitoes during the first five minutes of blood feeding. many of these transcripts remain induced until 1-hour pbm, although some remain induced until  <dig> hours pbm. after  <dig> hours post blood meal, the majority of early genes is down-regulated and they remain down-regulated even  <dig> hours after blood meal ingestion. a small subset of the early genes shows a variant pattern of gene expression in which the transcripts are up-regulated from the first  <dig> minutes of blood uptake through  <dig> hour pbm followed by a repression in expression from  <dig> to  <dig> hours pbm and then a greater than twofold induction at  <dig> hours pbm. the  <dig> unique transcripts represented by  <dig> cdnas in set  <dig>  the "middle genes", follow a more dynamic pattern of gene expression than the early genes . most middle genes are down-regulated in blood-fed versus sugar-fed mosquitoes until  <dig> hours pbm followed by an increase in expression commencing at  <dig> hours pbm and peaking between  <dig> and  <dig> hours pbm. subsequently, middle genes are down-regulated to initial transcript abundances by  <dig> hours pbm. also, in a behavior largely exhibited by the middle genes, approximately 40% of genes are down-regulated when the mosquitoes completed feeding and left the rat . set  <dig>  the "late genes" contains  <dig> unique transcripts,  <dig> cdnas, which are either down-regulated or constitutively expressed until  <dig> to  <dig> hours pbm after which they are up-regulated and, in contrast to the middle genes, continue to be highly expressed even at  <dig> hours pbm .

*the complete data set  contains  <dig> unique transcripts. however, ten transcripts are present in two different gene sets and were counted twice as a result.

principal components analysis  of these  <dig> unique differentially expressed transcripts was also conducted to support the k-means defined sets. following pca, each transcript was plotted in a scatter plot comparing the pca  <dig> and pca  <dig> values. the three k-means-defined sets of genes did not overlap on these scatter plots. thus the pca results support classification of these transcripts into three groups. for each of the k-means defined groups, genes that had a pca  <dig> or pca  <dig> value greater than  <dig>  or less than - <dig>  were plotted on a parallel coordinates display . the resulting data sets contained  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> unique transcripts representing early genes, middle genes, and late genes, respectively .

gene annotation and gene ontology assignments
to identify an. gambiae genes whose products are involved in related processes, the est consensus sequences of the transcripts differentially expressed in these  <dig> patterns were annotated using sequence similarity and categorized using the molecular functions listed by the gene ontology consortium  and the biological processes defined by holt et al.  <cit> . gene annotations for all  <dig> at least twofold differentially expressed gene products are given in the supplementary table s <dig>  they were then categorized into  <dig> major categories with  <dig> subdivisions . 48% of the genes could not be annotated and therefore were categorized as "unknown". the three most numerous categories containing annotated gene products were "metabolism", "protein synthesis", and "egg production".

during the  <dig> hours pbm, the majority of gene products involved in metabolism were up-regulated early and middle genes. largely different metabolic biological processes were up-regulated in early vs. middle and late genes. more than half of the early metabolic gene products, 20/ <dig> unique transcripts, appear to be involved in carbohydrate metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and protein digestion. in contrast, 80% of the metabolic genes, 24/ <dig> unique transcripts, represented in the middle genes contribute to various processes in protein digestion and metabolism, and metabolism of amino acids and their derivatives. one third of the late genes involved in metabolism, 8/ <dig> unique transcripts, are involved in protein metabolism. five of these annotated sequences, ass  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  encode products involved in post-translational modification.

reflecting the necessity of biosynthetic machinery in cell maintenance and growth, and probably also the highly conserved nature of proteins involved in housekeeping functions, the protein synthesis category contained the second largest number of genes functioning in a known process. 69%, 11/ <dig> unique transcripts and 53%, 10/ <dig> unique transcripts, respectively of the early and middle genes, in this category are involved in translation. approximately 25%, 5/ <dig> unique transcripts, and 40%, 6/ <dig> unique transcripts, of the protein synthesis genes represented among middle and late genes, are required for transcription and mrna processing. this result seems almost paradoxical because transcription and mrna processing necessarily precede translation.

a number of biological processes were related by their involvement in nuclear events or the overall activity of the cell. there were three times as many genes involved in cellular processes among the late genes than in the other two sets combined. although all the genes involved in the cell cycle are middle and late genes, the most strikingly up-regulated cellular process genes were those involved in chromatin assembly/disassembly.  <dig> of the  <dig> cellular process late genes  are involved in maintenance of chromatin structure, a biological process represented only in the late genes. these late genes include both histones and high mobility group proteins.

the majority of significantly up and down regulated genes appear to function in egg production, either in the development and maturation of oocytes or in the fat body synthesis of products that will be deposited in oocytes. almost 90% of them, 17/ <dig> unique transcripts, are middle and late genes. these genes are described in detail in the discussion section. in contrast, half of the genes categorized as cellular communication genes, 4/ <dig> unique transcripts, are early genes. the majority of the cellular communication gene products in the combined sets of middle and late genes, are involved in different signal transduction pathways. additionally, almost half of the intra-/extracellular architecture maintenance genes are early genes. this category includes a wide variety of gene products such as peritrophin, both muscle-related and cytoskeletal actins, α-catenin and β-integrin. the middle and late genes in this category were mainly structural and included two peritrophins .

the biological process categorized as transport included not only the movement of ions such as zinc, sodium and potassium, but also transport of molecules via receptor-mediated endocytosis. all three transport gene products, ass  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in the middle genes are responsible for the movement of ions. in contrast, in the early and late genes, several gene products  appear to be involved in receptor-mediated transport via clathrin-coated vesicles.

a number of genes responding to oxidative stress  were found in all three sets of genes indicating that they are transcribed throughout the  <dig> hours pbm. seven additional gene products most probably involved in immunity, a response to external stress, were found among these three gene sets.

qrt-pcr analysis
expression profiles of eight selected genes and the rp s <dig> control gene were confirmed using a quantitative real-time pcr strategy . transcript levels for each of the eight genes were quantified using sybr green technology and differences in their expression between sugar-fed and blood-fed mosquitoes at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours pbm determined. although the magnitudes of the changes in transcript abundances of all the genes whose expression levels were quantified by both techniques differed between the techniques, the changes in direction of expression, whether positive or negative, remained consistent for the majority of them. in addition, the overall patterns of expression exhibited by the three sets of genes were also apparent in the expression profiles created by qrt-pcr analysis. for the two early genes, microarray analysis overestimated transcript levels between 2- and 30-fold more than qrt-pcr analysis. in contrast, for the majority of the middle and late gene expression measurements, microarray analysis underestimated transcript abundances relative to qrt-pcr analysis.

discussion
we have determined the gene expression patterns of  <dig>  abdomen-derived cdnas from adult female an. gambiae mosquitoes representing  <dig> unique transcripts were determined in the first two days following ingestion of a blood meal by microarray analysis.  <dig> unique transcripts were shown to be up-or down-regulated at least twofold in blood fed mosquitoes relative to sugar-fed mosquitoes at one or more of the following times:  <dig> min and  <dig> min following initiation of blood feeding and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hr post-blood meal. these transcripts were clustered into three sets with different temporal patterns of expression that may reflect the major hormonal changes occurring within the mosquito during a gonotrophic cycle. these differentially expressed gene products were annotated putatively using sequence similarity searches and categorized by biological process to identify the major events occurring post blood meal ingestion in the female mosquito.

multiple hormones interact to alter tissue states and to activate genes involved in the female mosquito's digestion of a blood meal, in oocyte development and in vitellogenesis. the three sets of differentially transcribed genes discerned in this study, the early, middle and late genes may reflect differential hormonal responsiveness. after acquisition of a blood meal, the transcript levels of the early genes which were abundant during blood feeding showed general declines until  <dig> hours pbm, after which a subset of transcript levels began to rise again. expression of early genes may be linked to the relatively high titers of jh present at the beginning of the first gonotrophic cycle and may then be repressed as a result of declining jh titers or of increasing 20-e. the expression of middle gene transcripts followed an expression pattern that reflects the titers of 20-e: levels sharply increased by  <dig> hours pbm, remained stable or increased only slightly until  <dig> hours pbm, and then declined rapidly. oeh secreted by median neurosecretory cells stimulates the ovaries to secrete 20-e during vitellogenesis and the activity of this hormone begins to rise by 3– <dig> hours, peaks between  <dig> and  <dig> hours, and then declines to baseline levels by  <dig> hours post blood ingestion  <cit> . in contrast to the middle genes, most late gene transcripts exhibited baseline, steady state levels until  <dig> hours pbm after which they were induced at least twofold and continued to exhibit increased transcript levels at  <dig> hours pbm. this increase in transcript levels mirrored the increase in jh titer observed by  <dig> hours post blood meal ingestion  <cit> . these results suggest that middle genes products may be ecdysone-responsive whereas late genes products may be jh-responsive.

based on their finding that the drosophila minidiscs gene product showed a primary response to jh, dubrovsky et al.  <cit>  have suggested that jh may transcriptionally regulate genes encoding maternally inherited products. our late gene, as  <dig>  shares sequence similarity with minidiscs. additionally, the majority of mosquito gene products showing sequence similarity to maternally active drosophila genes are categorized as late genes. whether transcription of early genes is directly influenced by levels of jh or 20-e, cannot be determined easily because neither hormone is present at high levels during the first few hours following blood meal ingestion. regardless of expression pattern, the gene products in each set reflect a diverse array of processes occurring in the female mosquito within  <dig> hours following initiation of blood feeding. the major processes initiated in response to blood feeding including digestion, peritrophic matrix formation, oogenesis and vitellogenesis, are discussed below with emphasis on the likely roles of particular gene products.

digestion
digestion of the two different food sources, nectar sugars and blood, requires changes in the types of enzymes present within the digestive tract of the mosquito. the numbers of genes associated with sugar and protein metabolism within each set of genes may reflect the switch from sugar to protein metabolism. for instance, there are increases in transcript abundance of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation in the early genes. however, both early and middle gene categories are enriched in genes involved in protein digestion. this result stems from the involvement of certain gene products in blood meal digestion that initiate a signaling cascade resulting in the up-regulation of other related proteolytic enzymes. the middle genes contain the majority of gene products involved in amino acid metabolism, a process that follows protein digestion, whereas by  <dig> hours pbm, the time at which the majority of late genes are induced, there is a generalized decrease in digestive enzyme transcripts.

considering that blood contains large quantities of protein, the mosquito requires a variety of proteolytic enzymes to digest the recently acquired meal. in the present study,  <dig> genes were identified whose products are most likely required for protein digestion. these include  <dig> previously characterized digestive enzyme genes, two trypsins, a chymotrypsin, a serine protease and a carboxypeptidase. the majority of these digestive enzyme genes were transcribed at levels greater than twofold induction after  <dig> hours pbm. the an. gambiae trypsins  <dig> and  <dig> are both induced by a blood meal and exhibit similar expression profiles although trypsin  <dig> is expressed at higher levels. muller and coworkers, using an rt-pcr strategy, showed that trypsin  <dig> mrna is present at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours post blood meal  <cit> . in our study, the trypsin  <dig> gene  also exhibited increased transcript abundance at  <dig> hours pbm with maximal expression occurring at  <dig> hours pbm, but these levels decreased by  <dig> hours. in contrast to trypsins  <dig> and  <dig>  trypsins  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are constitutively expressed in non-bloodfed females. by  <dig> hours following a blood meal, levels of trypsin  <dig> become undetectable by northern and rt-pcr analysis and do not reappear until  <dig> hours pbm  <cit>  and unlike trypsins  <dig> and  <dig>  trypsin  <dig> reaches maximal expression by  <dig> hours, near the end of the gonotrophic cycle. our study identified two clones corresponding to trypsin  <dig>  but the two cdnas exhibited different expression patterns. one  reached maximal transcript abundance at  <dig> hours pbm, the expected expression pattern. however, the other cdna  was expressed at high levels prior to  <dig> hours pbm and also reached at least twofold increased levels by  <dig> hours pbm. these cdnas may not have clustered together for technical reasons intrinsic to seqman ii, or they may correspond to alternatively spliced variants of the same gene. the sequence alignment showed 97% nucleotide sequence identity between the two ests over the region common to both. however, the cd <dig> est is only  <dig> bp in length and it is possible that the full-length cdna represents an alternatively spliced transcript. in addition to trypsins  <dig> and  <dig>  we identified a trypsin-like serine protease  which shared the greatest amino acid similarity with trypsin  <dig>  however, this serine protease exhibited highest nucleotide identity to a different region of chromosome 3r than that containing all previously identified digestive trypsins. this gene product was induced greater than twofold within  <dig> hours pbm and was repressed during the height of digestion. unlike trypsins 3– <dig>  it was not expressed at higher levels at  <dig> hours pbm. it is possible that this trypsin is not involved in digestion but in another proteolytic process that is down-regulated following a blood meal.

barillas-mury et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the early trypsin activity is essential to the transcription and subsequent expression of the late trypsins in ae. aegypti. an. gambiae trypsins 3– <dig> may indirectly activate transcription and increase the expression of trypsins  <dig> and  <dig>  the major endoproteolytic enzymes required for blood meal digestion  <cit> . in both ae. aegypti and an. gambiae, these early expressed digestive enzymes are presumed to act as signal transducers causing transcriptional up-regulation of the late expressed ones  <cit> . thus the digestive process is regulated by an elaborate biphasic expression pattern of serine proteases. additional evidence suggests that not only tryptic peptides but cleaved amino acids may serve as systemic signals regulating subsequent processes. in contrast to the trypsin by-products, cleaved amino acids may also function as negative regulators of food intake. as  <dig> shared weak sequence similarity with the drosophila pumpless protein, a larval fat body-expressed enzyme involved in glycine catabolism. in the fruit fly, larvae expressing the pumpless mutation are unable to pump food from the pharynx to the esophagus  <cit> . these mutant animals do not feed, neither do they upregulate genes normally involved in responses to starvation. because feeding amino acids to wild type larvae phenocopied effects of the pumpless mutation, zinke et al.  <cit>  proposed that amino acids released from the fat body normally act as signals for cessation of feeding.

in addition to the trypsins, three chymotrypsin genes have been characterized in an. gambiae  <cit> . the expression of two of these digestive enzymes, anchym  <dig> and  <dig>  has been localized to the mosquito midgut by analysis of northern blots  <cit> . rt-pcr showed that both chymotrypsin genes are expressed at  <dig> hours pbm and are abundant until  <dig> hours pbm, unlike transcripts of trypsins  <dig> and  <dig> which have decreased dramatically by this time  <cit> . the cdna representing chymotrypsin  <dig>  as  <dig>  was categorized as a late gene since maximal transcript levels were achieved after  <dig> hours pbm. in contrast, the other characterized chymotrypsin, agchyl, exhibits changes in transcript abundance which is more similar to those of trypsins 3– <dig>  mrna is present in non-blood fed females, detectable until  <dig> hours post blood meal after which mrna can no longer be measured until  <dig> hours pbm  <cit> . the cdna corresponding to this chymotrypsin-like serine protease, as  <dig>  was induced more than twofold prior to the peak of digestion and clustered with the early genes. in addition to the aforementioned chymotrypsins, our study identified a previously uncharacterized chymotrypsin  also located on chromosome 2l but in a different region from both anchym <dig> and anchym <dig>  exhibiting an expression pattern different from both anchym <dig> and agchyl, this gene product was characterized as a middle gene with maximal transcript levels achieved between  <dig> and  <dig> hours pbm and a return to baseline by  <dig> hours pbm, similar to the expression patterns of trypsins  <dig> and  <dig> 

edwards et al.  <cit>  investigated expression levels of an. gambiae carboxypeptidase a following blood meal ingestion. northern blot analysis indicated that levels of carboxypeptidase a mrna rose rapidly to a ten-fold increase within 3– <dig> hours following a blood meal, then dropped to the pre-induction state by  <dig> hours pbm. we identified a carboxypeptidase gene located on chromosome 2l  that is transcribed in a manner similar to that of carboxypeptidase a. however another cdna representing a carboxypeptidase  exhibited a radically different expression pattern. transcripts were present at low levels 1– <dig> hours pbm but increased more than twofold between  <dig> and  <dig> hours pbm, a pattern that resembled the enzymatic activity in an. stephensi observed by jahan et al.  <cit> , namely a rapid increase until  <dig> hours pbm, with a peak at  <dig> hours, followed by a steady decline over the next day.

in contrast to the an. gambiae carboxypeptidase a, the levels of aminopeptidase peaked around  <dig> hours in an. stephensi  <cit> . additionally, lemos et al.  <cit>  recorded peak aminopeptidase activity at  <dig> hours pbm in an. gambiae. we identified two aminopeptidases with at least two-fold increased expression during the  <dig> hours pbm. the first aminopeptidase, as  <dig>  reached peak transcript levels at  <dig> hours pbm, showing a similar expression pattern to the enzyme activity levels reported by billingsley and hecker  <cit>  and lemos et al.  <cit> . in contrast, the other aminopeptidase, as  <dig>  showed amino acid similarity to the ae. aegypti aminopeptidase n. this aminopeptidase was classified as a late gene, due to increased transcript levels at  <dig> hours pbm but maximal levels were not achieved until  <dig> hours pbm. jahan et al.  <cit>  documented two different kinetic profiles of aminopeptidase enzymes in an. stephensi depending on whether the enzyme was soluble or membrane-associated. the soluble aminopeptidase exhibited a kinetic profile similar to as  <dig> and to that presented by billingsley and hecker  <cit>  with peak activity at  <dig> hours pbm.

geering  <cit>  had suggested that phospholipase activity plays a role in blood digestion in ae. aegypti although no conclusive evidence was demonstrated. however, geering and freyvogel  <cit>  demonstrated that lipolytic activity increased  <dig> hours after blood feeding. of the three gene products that are characterized as being involved in fatty acid/lipid metabolism and transport, two, ass  <dig> and  <dig>  encoding an acetate-coa ligase and a fatty acid binding molecule, respectively, are expressed at more than twofold greater abundance at  <dig> hours pbm. these gene products may be involved in fatty acid degradation of blood meal components and the transport of these lipids to the oocytes.

the erythrocyte membrane contains a number of glycoproteins. it is therefore possible that enzymes normally associated with carbohydrate metabolism of nectar meals could also be involved in blood digestion. almost all of the simple/complex carbohydrate metabolism and transport genes identified in our study as being at least twofold upregulated were categorized as early genes. within the first  <dig> hours pbm, their transcripts are present at higher levels than in sugar-fed females and thereafter, they decrease steadily until  <dig> and  <dig> hours pbm. this expression profile does not exclude these genes from having a role in rbc glycoprotein metabolism. several glycosidases are present within the midgut of an. stephensi, either associated with the lumen or with epithelial lysosomes  <cit> . the enzymatic activity of α-glucosidase, the major midgut glycosidase in an. stephensi, increased from  <dig> hours pbm to maximal levels by  <dig> hours and decreased to basal levels by  <dig> hours pbm in the anterior midgut. the transcript abundance of the α-glucosidase, as <dig>  characterized in this study followed a different pattern than the enzymatic activity of an. stephensi α-glucosidase. it showed greatest amino acid sequence similarity to drosophila melanogaster gene product cg <dig> α-glucosidase and was categorized as an early gene with minimal transcript levels occurring at and after  <dig> hours pbm.

peritrophic matrix formation
shen and jacobs-lorena  <cit>  characterized the an. gambiae peritrophic matrix protein peritrophin  <dig>  by analysis of northern blots, and demonstrated that transcripts were present  <dig> hours pbm, increased by  <dig> hours, and remained elevated between 24– <dig> hours pbm. the present study identified several genes encoding proteins with a chitin-binding domain  similar to the one found in peritrophin  <dig>  the early gene as  <dig> contains the peritrophin-a chitin binding domain and maps to chromosome 3l in silico, corresponding to agcp <dig>  another early gene, as  <dig>  shows high identity to peritrophin  <dig>  a middle gene, as  <dig>  is expressed by  <dig> hours pbm but does not reach maximal levels until  <dig> hours pbm. this gene product maps in silico to chromosome 2l, exhibits a similar transcript profile, and also shares 98% amino acid identity with peritrophin  <dig>  it is not clear why two sets of ests, both identified as peritrophin  <dig>  should exhibit different transcription patterns unless they are derived from differentially regulated genes. another middle gene, as  <dig>  contains the peritrophin-a chitin binding domain in addition to a prenyl-group binding site . this middle gene may not be involved in peritrophic matrix formation but in some other process coinciding with protein digestion. two other cdnas, accessions cd <dig> and cd <dig>  both in as  <dig>  could also be localized to chromosome 2l. however, their ests exhibited greatest nucleotide identity to the gene predicted as ensangg <dig> located  <dig> kb 3' to ag-aper <dig>  these two cdnas clustered as early and late genes respectively, and may represent alternatively spliced gene products.

as early as an hour after the adult female has taken a blood meal, secretory vesicles previously present in the apical brush border of midgut epithelial cells are no longer detectable . these apical granules presumably contain precursors of the peritrophic matrix. the middle and late peritrophin gene products may be packaged into vesicles in preparation for a subsequent blood meal. in contrast, the early peritrophin genes may be transcribed in response to blood meal acquisition and their products used immediately in the formation of the peritrophic matrix.

ovarian cycle and oogenesis
the extensive literature on genes involved in drosophila ovarian development and early embryogenesis opens windows into interpreting our an. gambiae microarray results and understanding mosquito egg development. the majority of an. gambiae genes upregulated at least twofold following a blood meal appear to function in egg production. the only gene possibly involved in oogenesis during the early phases of the ovarian cycle is the early gene as  <dig>  it shares sequence similarity with peter pan, a drosophila gene product required during oogenesis. oocytes in peter pan mutants often have an incorrect number of associated nurse cells, suggesting that the peter pan protein influences the separation of cells within the germaria  <cit> . the identification of other genes involved in the early stages of mosquito oogenesis may be facilitated by the construction of cdna libraries from the abdomens or ovaries of recently blood fed female mosquitoes.

several differentially expressed gene products found in the present study may be involved in the formation of ring canals, structures necessary for the delivery of maternal factors to oocytes. in particular, bulk transfer of cytoplasmic content from nurse cells to oocytes depends on actin structures  <cit> . a middle gene product, as  <dig>  shares sequence similarity to the drosophila gene cg <dig> encoding the protein kinase anchor protein  <dig>  akap <dig>  akap <dig> protein localizes to ring canals during oogenesis, regulates protein kinase c activity, and controls their morphology  <cit> . late gene product as  <dig> shows sequence similarity to the drosophila pendulin gene product, encoded by cg <dig>  this gene product is also required for assembly of fully functional ring canals. pendulin encodes an importin-α <dig>  a protein necessary for the localization of the kelch gene product, cg <dig>  kelch encodes an actin organizer without which the ring canals become occluded and nurse cell-oocyte cytoplasmic transport is inhibited  <cit> . though we found an apparent pendulin gene, we did not find kelch. a late gene product, as  <dig>  is the homolog of cdc <dig>  which encodes a small monomeric rho gtpase involved in signal transduction. rohatgi et al.  <cit>  suggested that cdc <dig> protein most likely links signal transduction to the actin cytoskeleton in xenopus. in drosophila ovaries, mutations in cdc <dig> caused nurse cells to deflate and coalesce, and inhibited transfer of nurse cell cytoplasm to oocytes in late stage egg chambers  <cit> .

drosophila nurse cells transcribe the bicoid anterior determinant gene and the resulting mrna is transported to the anterior region of developing oocytes via polarized microtubules  <cit> . bicoid does not appear to be an anterior determinant in other insects, but other genes important for its localization are conserved. the early gene as  <dig> shares similarity with the drosophila cornichon gene, cg <dig>  in drosophila, cornichon is required for formation of a functional microtubular cytoskeletal scaffold used to transport bicoid mrna and the posterior group oskar gene product to their proper location within the embryo  <cit> . the late gene product, as  <dig> exhibits greatest sequence similarity to d. virilis exuperantia, a gene whose product is also required for proper bicoid mrna localization d. melanogaster  <cit> . the late gene as  <dig> is putatively identified as the an. gambiae homolog of drosophila notch. in drosophila, notch signaling regulates a large number of ovarian events beginning with cyst development in the germarium and extending through oogenesis  <cit> . the mechanisms by which notch signaling activates transcription of its target genes are reviewed by barolo and posakony  <cit> . since we identified notch as a late gene, its activities may be more restricted in an. gambiae, and/or reflect fundamental differences in ovarian biology. as  <dig>  a late gene product, shares sequence similarity with drosophila rab-protein  <dig>  this drosophila small monomeric rab gtpase is also involved in the polarization of the microtubules for the organization of the posterior pole and for oskar localization there  <cit> .

to regulate the progress of oogenesis and embryogenesis, stored maternal mrnas are translationally repressed during early oocyte development. the middle gene product as  <dig> shares sequence similarity with the drosophila gene product bicaudal c, a rna binding protein that may play a role in translational silencing of maternal mrnas in addition to its role in eggshell patterning  <cit> . mutations in bicaudal c result in premature translation of oskar mrna before it has reached the posterior region of the oocyte  <cit> . the middle gene product as  <dig> is the putative homolog for the drosophila gene product vasa , an atp dependent helicase involved in pole plasm assembly that may also be involved in translational modification of maternal mrnas  <cit> . the late gene as  <dig> shares sequence similarity with the drosophila cup protein . cup protein interacts with nanos, the posterior determinant, and a translational regulator of the gap gene hunchback mrna during oogenesis, although the exact function of the cup protein still remains unknown  <cit> . a dead box protein encoded by vasa also influences oocyte differentiation and the development of the drosophila embryo body plan via translation of oskar, nanos, and gurken during oogenesis  <cit> . in amphibians, several mrna binding proteins have been identified that are only present in oocytes and not post cleavage embryos  <cit> . one an. gambiae middle gene product, as  <dig>  shared sequence similarity with the xenopus laevis poly-specific ribonuclease and also has mrna binding motifs, thus it may also repress translation of mrnas in embryos.

maternal nurse cells not only provide the biosynthetic machinery and mrna needed for oocyte axis determination, but also many transcripts and proteins required for zygotic development through the cellular blastoderm stage. the middle gene product as  <dig> shares sequence similarity with nop <dig>  encoding a maternally derived product of the drosophila cg <dig> gene, a component of the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein  complex involved in rrna processing  <cit> . the late gene product as  <dig>  referred to above in the context of its possible regulation by jh, shares sequence similarity with the drosophila minidiscs gene product, an amino acid transporter. in drosophila ovarian nurse cells, jh induces the expression of minidisks and its transcripts are most likely transferred to the oocyte during nurse cell cytoplasmic streaming  <cit> .

similar to the oocyte, the eggshell undergoes dorsal-ventral patterning. crucial to this process is the correct placement of the oocyte relative to the maternal somatic follicle cells. in drosophila, the localization of the oocyte depends on cadherin-associated adhesion  <cit> . the late gene product as  <dig> is the homolog of α-catenin, the cg <dig> gene product. a cytoskeletal anchor protein, α-catenin is required for positioning of the oocyte relative to the posterior follicle cells during germ cell rearrangement in drosophila  <cit> . the ras  <dig> signaling cascade is an important means of cell communication during embryo and eggshell patterning  <cit> . the middle gene product as  <dig> is weakly similar to the drosophila star protein, a ras  <dig> enhancer involved in the egf receptor signaling pathway, either upstream or in parallel to egfr, during formation of the embryonic ventral midline. star encodes a single pass transmembrane protein that may be involved in the processing of gurken protein. the dna damage checkpoint 14-3-3epsilon protein also participates in ras  <dig> signaling, normally functioning downstream or in parallel to raf, but upstream of transcription factors. the middle gene as  <dig> shares sequence similarity with drosophila 14-3-3epsilon. the 14-3-3epsilon protein is also capable of binding to a large number of other proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. one of its functions may be to alter the cell cycle by binding cyclin b and appears to have homologs in most if not all eukaryotes  <cit> . the an. gambiae cyclin b homolog, as  <dig>  grouped as a late gene.

mutation screens in drosophila have led to the identification of a number of other gene products that may be involved in ras  <dig> signaling. tppii , and smt <dig>  were discovered in a search for lethal mutations that could enhance a weak ras  <dig> eggshell phenotype  <cit> . the middle gene product as  <dig> shares sequence similarity with drosophila tripeptidyl-peptidase ii, the cg <dig> gene, encoding a serine protease that degrades neuropeptide signals  <cit> . the late gene product as  <dig> is the homolog of drosophila smt <dig>  cg <dig>  whose product is ubiquitin-like protein that may tag proteins for nuclear localization or retention in the cytoplasm  <cit> . smt <dig> protein may modulate activity of transcription factors in the follicle cells downstream of egfr activation. however, we feel that smt <dig> is likely to be a minor player in ras  <dig> signaling in the events following blood ingestion in the mosquito, because its mrna reaches maximal expression after 12– <dig> hours pbm, unlike the other gene products we identified as potentially influencing ras  <dig> signaling.

smt <dig> protein may also play a role in toll signaling. this signal transduction pathway is known to be necessary for dorsal/ventral patterning of the drosophila embryo. smt <dig> protein binds the nfκb homolog dorsal protein and targets this rel transcription factor for migration to the nucleus  <cit> . bhaskar et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that smt <dig> conjugation to the dorsal protein enhanced its transcriptional activity. smt <dig> protein may play other roles in the cell by altering the interactions of septins, cytoskeletal proteins involved in cytokinesis  <cit> . in drosophila, septins have been found in the cytoplasm of nurse cells and at the baso-lateral surfaces of follicle cells  <cit> . these results suggest even more pleiotrophc roles for the smt <dig> gene product in oogenesis. we also found that the late gene as  <dig>  a homolog of drosophila aos <dig>  the cg <dig> gene, the smt <dig>  activating enzyme, was also expressed at least twofold more abundantly during the height of smt <dig> expression. this result reinforces the importance of smt <dig> in the events occurring between 24– <dig> hours pbm.

in addition to genes regulating the polarity of the embryo and eggshell, genes involved in cellular growth and differentiation were differentially expressed during the  <dig> hours pbm ingestion. as  <dig> and  <dig> shared sequence similarity with the ae. aegypti ornithine decarboxylase antizyme, a protein that modulates polyamine synthesis. the homologous drosophila ornithine decarboxylase antizyme gene, formerly known as gut feeling, has been shown to be important in developing oocytes. it is one target of sex lethal which encodes an rna binding protein that regulates mrna splicing and the mitotic events in early germ cells via regulating cyclin b  <cit> . the late gene product as  <dig> shares sequence similarity with the drosophila polo cg <dig> gene product, a protein kinase required for cytokinesis and another regulator of cyclin b  <cit> . the early gene as  <dig> shows identity with the drosophila black pearl cg <dig> gene product. this protein contains dnaj domains implying that it is necessary for cellular growth  <cit> . northern blot analysis of black pearl rna from various developmental stages showed two transcripts with greatest expression in drosophila embryos 0– <dig> hours old  <cit> , the stages in which dna replication recurs most rapidly. the late gene as  <dig> shares sequence similarity with the drosophila imaginal disc growth factor <dig> , a mitogen with a non-functional chitinase domain. transcripts of idgf <dig> are detected in drosophila nurse cells, oocytes, and in the yolk cytoplasm of early embryos  <cit> . the middle gene product as  <dig> shares sequence similarity with drosophila β integrin. an. gambiae β integrin may interact with the middle gene as  <dig> product to promote somatic cell adhesion and cell migration during oogenesis and embryogenesis. this is due to the similarity of the as  <dig> gene to drosophila receptor of activated protein kinase c, rack <dig>  rack <dig> can bind a number of different signaling and cell adhesion molecules including the activated form of protein kinase c , src family kinases, and β integrins  <cit> . cox et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that, in a mammalian system, rack <dig> organizes focal adhesions and directional cell migration via its src-binding site. mahairaki et al.  <cit>  found that the an. gambiae β integrin gene was expressed at highest levels  <dig> hours pbm, whereas we found that the β integrin homolog reached at least twofold increased expression by  <dig> hours pbm.

a number of genes have been implicated in the development of the egg shell structures. our screen does not appear to have identified any homologs of the several endochorionic structural proteins characterized in ae. aegypti  <cit> . this was unexpected because northern blot analysis had indicated that transcription of the vitelline membrane proteins 15a- <dig>  15a- <dig>  15a- <dig> was induced rapidly between  <dig> and  <dig> hours pbm, reached maximal levels between  <dig> and  <dig> hours pbm, and decreased to baseline levels between  <dig> and  <dig> hours pbm  <cit> . our study also did not identify a dopa decarboxylase  gene, ddc is an enzyme involved in the tyrosine metabolic pathway necessary for eventual chorion melanization in ae. aegypti, and other melanization events. the gene is up-regulated in response to blood meal with transcripts initially detectable by  <dig> hours pbm, and maximal levels achieved between  <dig> and  <dig> hours pbm  <cit> . however, we did identify a gene encoding another enzyme involved in tyrosine metabolism. as  <dig>  a middle gene product, shared sequence similarity with the ae. aegypti dopachrome conversion enzyme  <cit> . this enzyme is required for processing of dopachrome to melanin. it is interesting that its mrna is constitutively expressed in ae. aegypti females, but becomes upregulated when they are infected with dirofilaria  <cit> . since insect melanins can be produced via any of three intermediates, dopa, dopamine, or dopachrome, it may be that an. gambiae differs from ae. aegypti in the substrate metabolized to produce chorionic melanin.

several middle and late genes encoding antioxidants were upregulated at least twofold 12– <dig> hours pbm. the middle gene, as  <dig>  a glutathione s-transferase d <dig>  and the three late genes, ass  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  encoding glutathione s-transferase 1– <dig> class theta, and homologs of drosophila thioredoxin and ae. aegypti 2-cys thioredoxin peroxidase, may have roles in regulating reactive oxygen species that can be produced from the highly reactive quinones which are normally cross-linked into melanin immediately after they are formed.

ovarian cycle and vitellogenesis
paramount to the development of the embryo is the massive accumulation of vitellogenin by the oocyte. in an. gambiae there is a small, polymorphic tandem array of vitellogenin genes and a single dispersed vitellogenin gene, all located on chromosome 2r in division 18b . vitellogenin mrna becomes detectable by northern blot analysis by  <dig> hrs pbm, though it is detectable earlier by rt-pcr, increases dramatically by  <dig> hours, reaches maximal levels by  <dig> hours, and declines to undetectable levels by  <dig> hours pbm  <cit> . our microarray study identified three cdnas, all middle gene products and greater than twofold induced, as vitellogenin gene homologs. two of the ests were not conjoined during est assembly because they represented non-overlapping 5' and 3' ends of the vg <dig> gene. the third est included the more closely resembled the sequence of the dispersed vitellogenin gene . as expected, all three vitellogenin clones exhibited expression profiles similar to the overall pattern previously described  <cit> .

following synthesis in the fat body, vitellogenins are released into the hemolymph. eventually, they diffuse through channels between the cells of the follicular epithelium and are accumulated by the oocyte by receptor-mediated endocytosis in clathrin-coated pits  <cit> . the increased number of gene products involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis before and after the height of vitellogenin gene transcription, 12– <dig> hours pbm in this study, may reflect a preparation for the increase in receptor-mediated endocytosis when the oocytes are accumulating vitellogenins and other yolk constituents during the trophic phase of the ovarian cycle. these genes included an early gene, as  <dig>  similar to the drosophila adaptin subunit, ap-1σ, cg <dig>  and the late gene, as  <dig>  homolog of another drosophila clathrin-associated protein, ap- <dig>  cg <dig> 

when vitellogenesis has ceased, the biosynthetic machinery in the fat body is degraded in lysosomes  <cit> . in ae. aegypti, the lysosomal cathepsin d-like aspartic protease  exhibited a similar transcription profile to vitellogenin  <cit> . cho et al.  <cit>  also identified a cathepsin b-like thiol protease, vitellogenic cathepsin b or vcb, which is secreted from the fat body with a peak at  <dig> hours pbm and incorporated into oocytes. it appears to be involved in the degradation of vitellin in embryos. the middle gene as  <dig>  a cathepsin b, shares identity with this ae. aegypti protein, exhibits the same expression profile, and may be its homolog. at approximately  <dig> hours pbm,  <dig> hours after peak production of vitellogenin, the activity of four other lysosomal enzymes, arylsulfatase a, acid phosphatase- <dig>  β-galactosidase, and cathepsin d, has dramatically increased to reach maximal levels by 36– <dig> hours pbm  <cit> . the two late gene products, ass  <dig> and  <dig>  were identified putatively as the lysosomal enzymes, acid phosphatase- <dig> and cathepsin f, respectively. these genes also may be involved in the termination phase of vitellogenesis. cathepsin f is necessary for oocyte growth in a teleost fish and has been suggested to be associated with yolk protein processing  <cit> . it will be a very interesting example of gene co-evolution, should processing of vitellogenins, proteins conserved between egg-laying vertebrates and non-brachyceran insects, actually be accomplished by similarly conserved cathepsins.

CONCLUSIONS
holt et al.  <cit>  performed the first genomic-scale study of hematophagy in an. gambiae by identifying  <dig> ests that differed in statistical abundance between cdna libraries made from adult female mosquitoes fed on sugar and  <dig> hours pbm. ribeiro  <cit>  extended this study by describing an additional  <dig> such genes. we have expanded on these studies by identifying additional  <dig> ests and by examining virtually a complete first gonotrophic cycle experimentally. in addition, we found  <dig> ests present in our microarray and ribeiro's  <cit>  studies. all but one  showed the same expression patterns at  <dig> hours pbm . these highly synchronous expression profiles of those ests further validate that experimental microarray and in silico data can complement each other. however, our study is unique in that we have determined the temporal patterns of expression of the genes we identified. the observed similarities between the gene expression patterns and production of the two principal insect hormones suggest that gene transcription may be influenced by changes in jh titers as well as by 20-e levels, a phenomenon that has been well-studied in the context of drosophila metamorphosis and in ae. aegypti vitellogenesis. future analysis may reveal genes co-regulated via the same promoters. indeed, this now appears possible for organisms whose genomes have been sequenced  <cit> . as new regulatory sequences are identified, the arsenal of transcriptional regulators to drive their tissue- and stage-specific gene expression will be increased. we expect that this increased promoter availability will supplement current vector-control strategies.

great progress has been made in the annotation of the an. gambiae genome, culminating in the public announcement of the genome sequence in  <dig> and its subsequent updates. yet, although we have identified  <dig> differentially expressed gene products, we could not assign almost half of them to a biological process. of the  <dig> "unknowns,"  <dig> unique transcripts shared no significant identity with sequences in the nr and dbest databases. the genes corresponding to these transcripts may be identified following the second gene build of the an. gambiae genome. functional studies using microarray analysis verified by qrt-pcr must confirm in silico predicted annotations and provide biological information about gene products. many of the gene products identified in this study share sequence similarity with drosophila proteins. much of the information generated by studies of fruit fly cell biology and development may also apply to mosquitoes, although it will be more difficult to test in an. gambiae, since it is not easily manipulated genetically. this study underscores the importance of ongoing functional studies including tissue-specific expression profiling using microarray analysis and qrt-pcr. understanding how the events following blood feeding are related to each other on a molecular level will provide a more comprehensive picture of this unique behavior and may also delineate new vector-control strategies.
