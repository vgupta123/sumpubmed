BACKGROUND
sucrose plays an important role in the plant life cycle. as the major photosynthetic product, it is essential for growth, the synthesis of biomass and as a carbon and energy source. in the cereals, it is converted into starch and storage proteins, while many dicotyledonous species use it to form lipids and/or storage proteins  <cit> . under stressful conditions , the plant cell typically accumulates sucrose as a protective osomoticum  <cit> . sucrose phosphate synthase  is one of the main regulatory enzymes involved in sucrose biosynthesis pathway in wheat and many other crop species  <cit> . it catalyzes the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate and udp-glucose into sucrose-6-phosphate, which is subsequently hydrolysed to sucrose by the action of sucrose phosphate phosphatase .

in important crop plants like maize, rice and sugarcane, plant growth and productivity have been correlated with sps activity. sps activity has been correlated with sucrose accumulation in sugarcane stems  <cit> , while in maize, correlations have been demonstarted with vigour and biomass yield  <cit> . genetic studies in maize have also shown that grain yield qtl  are linked to sps activity qtl, as are adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase  activity qtl  <cit> . in rice, the location of plant height qtl appears to coincide with that of ossps <dig>  as the transgenic plants with increased sps activity grew taller than the non-transformed control  <cit> . in tobaccco lines engineered to over-express sps, udp- glucose pyrophosphorylase and sucrose synthase, plant height was increased and flowering time delayed  <cit> , while the heterologous expression of atsps induced longer stems and greater biomass  <cit> . finally, the over-expression of zmsps in potato was shown to improve a number of yield-realted characters  <cit> , while in tomato, it altered the pattern of carbohydrate partitioning in the leaf  <cit> .

the regulation of sps activity is rather complex, and involves fine tuning at both the transcriptional and the post-translational level  <cit> . among the dicotyledonous plant species, three sps gene families have been recognized, while in the monocotyledonous poaceae species wheat, maize and rice, there are five gene families  <cit> . here, we report the temporal patterns of expression of sps and spp, and the discovery of structural polymorphisms between homoeologous copies of spsii. we have also identified the presence of unspliced introns in one of its homoeologues. evolutionary relationships among the spsii homoeologues have been illustrated by comparisons between the gene sequences present in hexaploid wheat and its progenitors. finally, we extend the phylogeny to other grass species.

RESULTS
gene expression analysis of sucrose biosynthesis genes during wheat plant ontogeny
as a first step, the wheat affymetrix probe sets representing sps and spp members were identified, based on the criteria used to define the five sps  <cit>  and the three spp  <cit>  types. the expression patterns of these gene family members was extracted from the normalized expression data from imbibed embryo, coleoptile, seedling root, crown, seedling leaf, stem , developing anther, developing caryopsis , and the developing endosperm and embryo at  <dig> dap. except for sppiii, the spp genes were expressed throughout plant development, although their level tended to be highest in the developing anther and developing caryopsis . different sps members show highly regulated spatio-temporal expression patterns during plant ontogeny, suggesting the existence of fine regulation at the first step of sucrose biosynthesis.

as spsi was prominently expressed in the seedling leaf and the mature stem  its function may be associated with the re-synthesis of sucrose from fructan. spsii , spsiii , taspsiv and taspsva were prominently expressed during microsporogenesis  and in the mature anther. all the spp families were highly expressed during anther development . thus, these genes are clearly important for normal pollen/anther development. interestingly, note that in the arabidopsis thaliana mutant kns2- <dig>  an altered sps glycosyltransferase i domain disrupts the function of sucrose synthesis, and this leads to changes in the synthesis of the pollen primexine or callose  <cit> . in the wild type, sps <dig>   is expressed in uni- and bicellular microspores as well in more mature anthers. the present data showed that probably all the sps and spp genes were constitutively expressed throughout caryopsis development, indicating that more than one sps isoforms contributes to overall sps activity .

furthermore, it is important to know how these different sps members are spatially expressed in different seed tissues and possible co-expression of these members in the same cell for making hetero-oligomeric complexes to be functional. the developing caryopsis imports sucrose to driving its growth and allow storage of metabolites. the expression of sps and spp members within the developing caryopsis suggests that sucrose cleavage, transport and re-synthesis during its internal transport can be differentially regulated within various distinct tissues. of particular interest was the observation that both variants of spsii are differentially expressed in the developing caryopsis. thus, ta. <dig> .s1_at was highly expressed both throughout anther development and during late embryo development, while taaffx. <dig> .s1_at was expressed most strongly during early caryopsis development. the contribution of the individual spsii homeologues and the occurance of alternative splicing are expanded upon in the following section. besides alternative splicing, a contributory reason for the present exclusive focus on the spsii family was that there were four spsii cdna sequences available in the public domain, which gave the opportunity to design homoeologue-specific primers for three wheat genomes. insufficient sequence data are presently available for the other sps families. therefore, in order to study polyploidization and phylogenetics relationship between three wheat genomes, spsii was selected as best suited candidate.

structural analysis of spsii genes in wheat and its relatives
both introns and exons were targeted for the design of homoeologue-specific primers . the resulting amplicons allowed for the sequencing of portions of each of the spsii homoeologues. in all,  <dig>  bp of the cv. chinese spring a genome homoeologue sequence was acquired from a combination of homoeologue-specific amplicons and flow-sorted chromosome arm 3a sequences . we acquired  <dig>  bp of the b genome homoeologue sequence, and  <dig>  bp of the d genome homoeologue, both from cv. chinese spring . sequence of the spsii orthologues in triticum urartu , t. speltoides , aegilops tauschii  and barley  was obtained in a similar fashion. their alignment is provided as additional file  <dig>  spsii has  <dig> introns and  <dig> exons in wheat, barley, rice, sorghum and purple false brome  . in rice, sorghum and purple false brome, the gene length is  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively . in einkorn and t. speltoides six exons and six introns were amplified, while in goatgrass, this was extended to eight exons and seven introns. in hexaploid wheat, certain regions could not be sequenced either due to the presence of large introns or due to unavailability of homoeologue-specific primers. the intronic sequences were more polymorphic than the exonic ones, which were highly conserved among the species compared . in the six exons for which sequence was available, the level of similarity level ranged from  <dig> %  to 99%  . in contrast, for the six intronic regions compared, the similarity level ranged from  <dig> %  to 99%  . intron  <dig> of the wheat b genome homoeologue was unspliced, since it was present in the cdna af <dig>  <cit> . sequence alignment and subsequent cluster analysis showed that the purple false brome sequence was more similar to those of wheat and barley in comparison to rice sequence, and the sorghum sequence was the one most highly diverged from that of wheat , as was the expectation on taxonomic grounds  <cit> .

genetic mapping of taspsii genes in wheat
the homoeologue-specific primers developed for each of the wheat spsii copies were validated by an analysis of the nulli-tetrasomic lines of cv.'chinese spring'; this showed that each amplicon was derived from a member of the homoeologous group three chromosomes . a polymorphism for the a genome copy between the parents of the itmi  mapping population allowed it to be located  <dig>  cm distal of xtam61a in the sub-telomeric of the short arm of chromosome 3a . the b genome copy was placed in a matching location on chromosome 3b between xksug53a and xcdo460c . the d genome copy was not mappable in the itmi mapping population, but was localised to d genome through anueploid stocks.

detection of snp diversity
the spsii amplicons obtained from  <dig> diverse wheat accessions were sequenced in a search for single nucleotide polymorphisms . for the a genome copy, the intron  <dig> to exon  <dig> region was targeted, while for the b genome, the target was exon  <dig> to the 3' utr, and, for the d genome copy, intron  <dig> to exon  <dig>  three snps were uncovered in the 3a gene, all within an exonic region corresponding to the sucrose phosphate synthase/possible sucrose phosphate phosphatase domain. of the three snps, two were non-synonymous snps; the first induced the residue change argeneine <dig> to lysine <dig>  and the second from alanine <dig> to valine <dig> . of the four b genome copy snps detected, three were located within intronic sequences, and one within the 3' utr . no snp was detected within the d genome copy. overall, it was possible to define four distinct haplotypes for each of the a and the b genome copies .

three genomes differentially contributes to the expression of taspsii
quantitative real time pcr based on exonic sequences of the a and d genome copies, and within the unspliced intronic region of the b genome copy was applied to various tissues of, cv 'prinz'. spsii was expressed during germination as well as in the developing caryopsis at four and eight days after anthesis . a similar level of expression was measured in the germinating seed and in the developing caryopsis at four daf, and this fell somewhat by eight daf. the a genome copy dominated the global expression of spsii; there was very little contribution from the b genome copy .

discussion
genomic sequence analysis of spsii genes
sequence variation in sucrose biosynthesis pathway genes such as sps is of particular interest because its consequence can be a change at the level of phenotype, sometimes involving vigour, biomass productivity and economic yield. markers from the expressed portion of genome, that are responsible for some important physiological aspects, have been developed in wheat  <cit> . a particular complication in bread wheat is that most genes which are present in single copy in the diploid grasses such as rice and purple false brome are represented by three copies. in order to interpret wheat gene expression data, it is therefore necessary to derive specific assays for each homoeologous copy, as we have described here for spsii . these assays are also necessary for the application of pyrosequencing as a snp discovery platform  <cit> .

frequency of snps
the low level of snp within spsii suggests that variation in its sequence is constrained by selection against changes in its physiological activity. other starch metabolism enzyme encoding genes have similarly been associated with little sequence variation  <cit> . the observed snp frequency was  <dig> per  <dig> bp within the a genome copy, and  <dig> per  <dig> bp within the b genome copy, frequencies which are typical for bread wheat  <cit> . most of the spsii snps were located within either an intron or the 3' utr, with only two exonic non-synonymous ones uncovered. these latter substitutions may be of physiological significance, given that an alanine to valine change compromised the processing of a  <dig> kda protein in maize  <cit> , and that an arginine to lysine substitution in the bzip domain of the maize opaque gene abolished the specificity of its dna binding  <cit> .

presence of an unspliced intron in taspsii cdna is mapped to b genome
intronic sequence was relatively variable at the inter-specific and inter-generic level , while exonic sequence was well conserved . this pattern is characteristic of gene sequences in the grasses  <cit> . analysis of the sequence of spsii cdna clone af <dig> has demonstrated alternative splicing for one of the spsii genes  <cit> . the development of homoeologue-specific assays has allowed the unspliced intron to be located to the b genome copy of spsii. both of the alternative transcripts  occurred in the pre anthesis spike  <cit> . cdna of einkorn wheat , goatgrass , durum wheat  and bread wheat  were amplified using primer pairs w-spsii-il & w-spsii-nr, which target the unspliced intron in the b genome copy of spsii. amplification was observed from bread and durum wheat template, but not from either einkorn or goatgrass . an aneuploid analysis confirmed the b genome specificity of the unspliced intron . thus the unspliced intron is clearly restricted to the b genome copy of spsii.

contribution of a and d genome for the expression of taspsii
all five sps members appeared to be both spatially and temporally regulated. of special interest in spsii with two different variants, ta. <dig> .s1_at: highly expressed throughout anther development as well also during late seed development in embryo and taaffx. <dig> .s1_at: expressed mainly during early seed development. the expression pattern of ta. <dig> .s1_at was consistent with that previously exposed by northern blot analysis  <cit> , but the expression of the latter gene has not been documented before. although microarray-based expression data reflect very clearly any differences between distinct genes, they are not informative at the level of homoeologues, because the array features are not homoeologue-specific. in this case, homoeologue specific primers could play a vital role in knowing the contribution of three different genomes in terms of gene expression pattern. similar strategy was also used earlier for studying expression patterns of benzoxazinones biosynthesis in wheat contributed by different genomes  <cit> . the present data have shown that the a genome copy of spsii dominated the global expression of spsii and that the b genome copy - despite its two alternative transcripts - the least.

synteny to rice is perturbed at spsii locus
at the cdna sequence level, spsii is highly similar to its rice orthologue, which is located on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . gene order is largely conserved among the major cereal genomes  <cit> , which has allowed for the identification of a syntenic relationship between rice chromosome  <dig> and the wheat chromosomes of homoeologous group seven. the prediction is therefore that wheat spsii should map to wheat chromosomes 7a, 7b and 7d, and not, as is the case, to chromosomes 3a, 3b and 3d. the chromosomal location that we have deduced is secure, as it relies on a combination of anaeuploid analysis, genetic mapping, the placement of spsii ests http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/cgi-bin/westsql/map_locus.cgi, and the presence of spsii sequence on flow-sorted chromosome 3a template. rice chromosome  <dig> has been reported to be highly syntenic to wheat chromosome three  <cit> . in the present study, it appears that a segment at least of the group  <dig> chromosomes has lost synteny with rice chromosome  <dig>  failure of synteny and breakdown of colinearity is well documented  <cit> . prominent examples involve the regions around both gbss <dig>  <cit>  and the pbf orthologues in wheat and barley  <cit> . of  <dig> mapped ests mapping to the wheat group  <dig> chromosomes, ~15% shared homology with rice genes mapping outside of chromosome  <dig>  and various complexities associated within co-linear regions suggests that the relationship between these chromosomes is not straightforward  <cit> . similarly, the analysis of  <dig> gb of chromosome 3b has identified the presence of gene sequences whose rice orthologues do not map to chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , while the annotation of  <dig> mb of various regions of chromosome 3b has shown that only half of the predicted genes present had orthologues on rice chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the spsii genes lie in the distal region of their respective wheat chromosome, which suggests that co-linearity with rice may be lost there. complex duplications, rearrangements and polyploidization events have led to the erosion of synteny and colinearity between rice and wheat  <cit> . the imminent completion of the sequence of the entire chromosome 3b will allow the formulation of a better picture of orthologous relationships between wheat, rice, sorghum and false purple brome, as the genomes of later three species have already been fully sequenced.

phylogenetic relationship of taspsii in the context of polyploidization among hexaploid wheat and its progeniotors
the sequence alignments and subsequent phylogenetic analyses was carried out considered either exons or introns or both . the hexaploid wheat a genome copy consistently appeared closest to that of einkorn wheat, the a genome progenitor. at the level of exons only, the b genome copy appeared closely related to that of t. speltoides, a species considered to be taxonomically close to the b genome progenitor. branching patterm in dendrogram was little disturbed when considered only introns depicting nonconserved nature of introns. with respect to the d genome copy, the comparison with its goatgrass orthologue was only possible on the basis of the sequence of one large exon. this showed that the d genome copy was more similar to the goatgrass orthologue than to any of the others. the level of homology in the exonic sequence between the a genome and the einkorn copy was  <dig> %, decreasing to  <dig> % when intronic sequences were compared . the equivalent similarities between the b genome and the t. speltoides copies were  <dig> % and  <dig> % . and that between the d genome and the goatgrass exonic sequence was  <dig> %. thus, polyploidization has left exonic sequence largely unchanged, while intronic sequence has been able to drift somewhat, as has been repeatedly observed in such comparisons  <cit> . the origin of bread wheat has involved two separate allopolyploidization events, the first between einkorn and a species closely related to t. speltoides, and the second between the resulting wild tetraploid t. dicoccoides and goatgrass  <cit> . the phylogeny predicted from the sequences of the spsii homoeologues and wild species orthologues is fully consistent with this settled origin  and supports the previous published studies  <cit> .

phylogenetic relationship of taspsii between different grasses
the phylogenetic analysis showed that the purple false brome spsii sequence is more similar to those of wheat and barley than to that of rice, not only in terms of the sequence itself, but in terms of the gene's overall length. the purple false brome spsii fragment extending from exon  <dig> to the 3'end of the gene  was  <dig> bp longer than the longest wheat or barley sequence, while this difference was  <dig>  bp in rice and  <dig>  bp in sorghum. a number of phylogenetic studies have shown that the taxonomic separation between the triticeae and purple false brome is much less than between them and rice  <cit> , which is the reason why purple false brome has been so readily adopted as a model genome for the triticeae  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a study of the expression of sucrose biosynthesis gene family members has revealed that sps genes are highly regulated both spatially and temporally. we have been able to locate the spsii homoeoloci to the short arms of their respective group  <dig> chromosomes, and have shown that their divergence is consistent with the known evolutionary relationships between the component genomes of hexaploid wheat. a phylogenetic study confirmed that purple false brome is a more appropriate model for the triticeae than rice. we have provided evidence that the syntenic relationship between rice chromosome  <dig> and wheat group  <dig> chromosomes is perturbed in the region where the spsii genes map. we have shown that the transcript of the b genome copy of spsii exists as two alternative forms, one with, and the other without an intron. the b genome copy contributed least to the global expression of spsii expression. the development of homoeologue-specific markers for, and snps within the wheat spsii genes will enable the definition of any associations between spsii genotype and plant phenotype in terms of vigour, biomass productivity or source-sink relationships.
