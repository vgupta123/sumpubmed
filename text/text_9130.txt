BACKGROUND
micrornas  are approximately  <dig> nucleotide  long molecules, constituting a highly abundant class of non-coding rnas  encoded in the genome of all eukaryotes  <cit> . over the last few years thousands of micrornas have been discovered in different organisms and the conservation of most of the micrornas has been confirmed across species  <cit> ,  <cit> . this novel class of ncrnas provides a new, exciting view on gene regulation mechanism at the post transcriptional level by down-regulating their target mrnas  <cit> . finely tuned gene expression is crucial to physiological processes like embryonic development, cellular differentiation, cellular growth control, homeostasis and response to external stress factors such as pathogens. with a growing number of studies, it is becoming more apparent that micrornas play a pivotal role in various physiological and developmental processes  <cit> . some micrornas are differentially expressed in a developmental-stage–specific, tissue-specific or pathological-stage-specific manner which is consistent with their gene regulatory function, while others seem to be present constitutively, suggesting their role in homeostasis mechanisms  <cit> . an increasing number of studies report the crucial role of micrornas in human disorders and disease progression. de-regulation of many microrna species has been associated with pathological states including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, bacterial infections and immunological response to the latter  <cit> .

in protection against intruding pathogens, an organ-specific as well as a systemic immunological host response is activated. this response is activated by the presence of so called pathogen-associated molecular patterns  that are sensed by pattern recognition receptors , for instance the toll-like receptor   <cit> . stimulation of prrs leads to activation of the innate and adaptive immune response, elimination of the detected invading pathogen and development of a long lasting immunity against it. this complex and highly organized line of defense requires precisely balanced and well managed regulatory events for its proper function. imbalanced inflammatory response may lead to septic shock-like condition that can cause death of the host due to multiple organ failure  <cit> . the expression of micrornas involved in host response to pathogens is well established in viral infections  <cit> ,  <cit> . micrornas like mir-29a and mir- <dig> have been found to repress the expression of viral mrnas by possible recognition and targeting of viral nucleic acids with mir- <dig> specifically targeting hiv- <dig> 3’utr region  <cit> ,  <cit> . in contrast, replication of hcv  is dependent on the activity of mir- <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, the role of mammalian micrornas in bacterial infections is still in its infancy. there is evidence indicating strong involvement of micrornas in immune response and inflammation after bacterial infection  <cit> ,  <cit> . tlrs recognizing pamps have been found to regulate several micrornas. for example, mir-146a/b and mir- <dig> have been induced by tlr4-mediated sensing of bacterial lipopolysaccharide   <cit> ,  <cit> . it has been shown that the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells , a central transcription factor for a wide range of innate immune factors including several cytokines, interacts with the promoter region of mir-146a  <cit> . lps stimulation results in up regulation of mir- <dig> expression. this microrna is also believed to be under direct regulation of nf-κb and simultaneously regulating it  <cit> . moreover, mir- <dig> has been shown to be induced by the bacterium helicobacter pylori, a known pathogen of the human stomach  <cit>  and has been proven to act as a global immune regulator in endotoxin-tolerant macrophages, proving that microrna expression depends strongly on the status of infected cells  <cit> .

actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae , serotype 5b is a bacterial pathogen infecting the porcine respiratory track, causing pleuropneumonia  <cit> . the disease causes severe economic losses to the pig industry. very important virulence-associated factors of app are the three different exotoxins belonging to the rtx family . the toxins cause serious damage to the lungs and interact with host immunity. the bacterium is represented by at least  <dig> different serotypes. serotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are usually highly virulent  <cit> . the complete picture of app pathogenesis and host response to the infection has not yet been unraveled. there is a considerable lack of knowledge about the role that micrornas play in app infection. to our knowledge this is the first study on microrna expression profiles in porcine lung tissue infected with actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. however, the expression profiles of protein coding genes in app infection have been studied previously by  <cit> .

the pig  has a high economic value for meat production worldwide and is an important animal model for biomedical research. the availability of a nearly completed assembly of the porcine genome allows annotation of various classes of ncrnas and further provides possibilities for assigning function of those key molecules  to the gene regulatory network. yet, since the early studies of mirnas in the pig genome  <cit> , the number of porcine micrornas deposited in mirbase  <cit>  is considerably smaller than the number of mirnas in human or mouse. the newest version of mirbase  <dig>  includes  <dig> microrna entries in homo sapiens,  <dig> in mus musculus and only  <dig> in sus scrofa. more studies on porcine micrornas are required for expansion of the repertoire of these small regulatory elements involved in development, growth and pathological conditions. the present study utilizes high throughput sequencing technology as well as bioinformatic tools to obtain expression profiles of micrornas in porcine lung samples representing necrotic and visually unaffected areas, 14–18 h after experimental infection with actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. the above mentioned approaches to small rna expression profiling, discovery and target predictions are reviewed in  <cit> . we detected a significant de-regulation of a number of host micrornas during bacterial infection. a large number of those de-regulated micrornas have putative target sites in genes involved in acute phase response; lps induced innate immunity response to pathogens and apoptosis. the majority of the microrna candidates selected for validation in the present study are found to target multiple  protein coding genes. moreover, several novel micrornas have been discovered including one microrna showing particularly high expression  in porcine lung. interestingly, this putative novel microrna appears to be specific for pig and closely related species as cow and dolphin. this is the first study elucidating the expression of micrornas and their regulatory networks in pigs exposed to bacterial pathogen infection. taken together, our data suggest that bacterial infection causes significant changes in the expression profiles of micrornas within the infected lung, thus affecting the regulation of genes involved in the immunological response to inflammation and apoptosis.

RESULTS
overview of high throughput sequencing, alignment and clustering
to investigate the composition and dynamic changes of ncrna  expression in lung tissue from pigs infected with app, we constructed two small rna libraries that were sequenced using illumina gaiix high throughput sequencing technology. a pool of eight samples from necrotic areas was used to create the necrotic library and the unaffected library was constructed out of ten pooled samples from visually unaffected areas. illumina gaiix sequencing generated  <dig> , <dig> raw reads  in the necrotic sample and  <dig> , <dig> raw reads in the visually unaffected sample, after filtering of low quality reads . for the necrotic sample, sub sequential adapter removal and quality filtering, resulted in a total of  <dig> , <dig> 18– <dig> nt long reads. only high quality reads where accepted for alignment by novoalign  <cit> . in the same sample, a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads aligned to the pig genome  <cit>  version  <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> of these aligned uniquely. for the visually unaffected sample the corresponding numbers of raw reads were  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  respectively. in this study, we only used reads that aligned uniquely . the typical size range corresponding to mature microrna sequences is between  <dig> and  <dig> nt. among millions of uniquely aligned, high quality reads, 74% and 25% in the visually unaffected and necrotic library respectively, belong to this size range. the visually unaffected sample follows the typical read distribution for small rna sequencing with a majority of raw reads belonging to the mature mirna range of 19– <dig> nt . both libraries were rather complex in their composition, including various classes of ncrnas as well as a large number of degradation products of different length originating mostly from coding but also non coding transcripts as well as repetitive elements. the degradation products were particularly distinct in the necrotic sample, which explains the difference in the read size distribution between the two libraries . 

using reads that aligned uniquely to the pig genome version  <dig>  we found  <dig>  read clusters shared between the libraries . the number of clusters depends heavily on the cutoff based on the number of reads in the cluster. with cutoffs of  <dig> and  <dig>  we found  <dig>  and  <dig>  read clusters, respectively. to reduce the number of false positives on one hand, while preserving the opportunity to discover low expressed mirnas on the other, we chose to use the  <dig>  clusters with raw read count of at least  <dig> in one of the two libraries for further analysis.

clustering of raw reads is obtained after the alignment to the reference genome.

table  <dig> shows that in both the necrotic and the visually unaffected samples the number of raw reads forming clusters with more than five reads comprises over 90%  of all the reads.

annotation
ncrna detection by homology and class-specific tools
we annotated the main classes of ncrnas using an in house ncrna pipeline  and we used the protein annotation from ensembl version  <dig>  <cit>  to annotate the messenger rnas. finally,  <dig>  out of  <dig>  merged read clusters were successfully annotated . various ncrna classes including mirna, snrna, snorna, trna, scarna  were found. there are great differences in the amount of rrna/mrna/microrna raw reads when comparing the two libraries as shown in figure  <dig>  this result can be explained by degradation occurring more intensively in the necrotic sample in such an advanced stage of infection. a total of  <dig> , <dig> uniquely mapped raw reads corresponded to rrna genes in the necrotic sample, while the number of reads annotated as rrna in the sample from visually unaffected areas was  <dig>  reads, or  <dig> times less. the situation is reversed when looking at the number of reads for micrornas. the necrotic sample is represented by  <dig>  raw reads annotated as microrna whereas the visually unaffected is represented by  <dig> , <dig> raw reads, which is almost  <dig> times more than in the necrotic sample . this dramatic decrease in mirna can be understood as follows: as the concentration of rrnas increases, so does the rrna sampling probability and the sampling probability of the mirna must conversely drop. 

the read clusters with at least five reads are subjected to annotation. the ncrnas are annotated with our in house ncrna pipeline; the mrnas are annotated according to the ensembl protein annotation of the pig. in case of overlapping annotation the read clusters were merged. the classification of the ncrnas is in accordance with rfam. small cajal body-specific rna .

detection of mirnas by homology
the known mirnas were identified by blast  <cit>  against mirbase or by infernal  <dig>   <cit>  with the models from rfam <dig>  <cit> . we detected  <dig> mirnas using high confidence blast  against the hairpins from mirbase version  <dig>  of the total of  <dig> mirnas with annotated hairpins,  <dig> were ssc mirbase hairpins and  <dig> were annotated hairpins from other organisms. in addition, five mirnas were not recognized by high confident blast, but were matched by rfam/infernal as members of mirna families.

detection of novel mirnas
a distinct pre-mirna hairpin structure is a primary criterion for microrna annotation. the hairpin structure and characteristic read patterns of mirnas makes them much easier to detect than other novel ncrnas in general  <cit> . in the present study novel mirnas were predicted with mirdeep <dig>  <cit> . the bowtie  <cit>  mapping performed by the mirdeep <dig> pipeline reports reads with up to five matches to the genome.

we found  <dig> mirnas annotated by mirdeep <dig> where  <dig> were from known mirnas and eight were from other types of ncrnas. overlapping the mirdeep <dig> results with the novoalign read clusters of at least five uniquely mapped raw reads, we confirm  <dig> of the  <dig> mirdeep <dig> detected mirnas. among the  <dig> clusters found by both mirdeep <dig> and the clustering of the reads aligned with novoalign,  <dig> predictions were also matched to non-mirna infernal families,  <dig> were aligned to known mirnas, and  <dig> were predicted to be new, un-annotated mirnas.

these  <dig> novel predictions were further evaluated by requiring at least five reads detected by mirdeep <dig>  and either both mature and star sequences to be present, or alternatively structure conservation of the site by rnaz pre-release version  <dig>  <cit> . after curation,  <dig> predicted novel mirnas, which are listed in table  <dig>  remained. in mirbase  <dig>  mir-d <dig> is annotated as ssc-mir- <dig> which was not known in the mirbase version  <dig> used for the annotation pipeline . the bowtie mapping of the reads revealed a number of known mirnas not present in the novoalign mapping of which  <dig> were expected to be detected only once in the reference genome, but were found twice in close proximity, indicating errors in the assembly . 

predictions are confirmed by the unique mappings from novoalign and either conserved structure according to rnaz or by having reads in both mature and star.  <dig> mirnas are novel according to mirbase. read counts in this table are based on raw reads and refer to the bowtie mapping used by mirdeep <dig>  vu stands for visually unaffected. one mirna  marked with a § is mir- <dig>  found in mirbase <dig> so cannot be any longer considered novel.

profiles of expression during app infection
characterization of the libraries composition
the ncrnas of the necrotic tissue are dominated by the degraded rrnas. other long ncrnas also show high raw read counts compared to the unaffected tissue. it may, however, be noted that the fraction of trnas are comparable in the two samples. the summed raw reads of the micrornas in particular as well as snornas are much lower in the necrotic sample compared to the visually unaffected one.

we annotated  <dig> clusters as being parts of protein coding genes . the raw reads for these clusters are quite different between the samples,  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads in necrotic and visually unaffected respectively, which underlines the higher degree of degradation of mrnas in the necrotic tissue which poses challenges in the interpretation of the microrna expression levels .

highly abundant micrornas
high throughput illumina gaiix sequencing revealed a number of highly expressed micrornas. we present the  <dig> most abundant micrornas in both samples . most of the top  <dig> mirnas are annotated in pig in mirbase, with the exception of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and a novel mirna . noteworthy, the top two, most abundant micrornas, namely mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are shared between the two libraries. in each sample, mir- <dig> has by far, the highest number of reads constituting 65% and 49% of all normalized microrna reads  in the necrotic and the visually unaffected sample, respectively.

the reads shown in the table are normalized to counts per million calculated by the tmm normalized sample size, the log <dig> of the fold change  and the p-values are determined by the exact-test.

after normalization of the raw reads accordingly we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> known and novel mirnas were significantly up regulated in the necrotic sample with an e-value cutoff of  <dig> . similarly,  <dig> mirnas were significantly down regulated . interestingly, the highly expressed novel mirna on the negative strand of chromosome  <dig> called mir-d <dig> is present in the top  <dig> most abundant micrornas and shows up regulation in the necrotic sample . this novel microrna is only found in pig, cow and dolphin. the complete list of  <dig> known and novel mirnas is provided in additional file  <dig> 

the reads shown in the table are normalized to counts per million calculated by the tmm normalized sample size, the log <dig> of the fold change  and the p-values are determined by the exact-test. a p-value cutoff of  <dig>  was applied. the mirnas marked with  were chosen for rt-qpcr.

the top  <dig> most expressed snornas show a much larger variation between the two samples. nine are common in the top  <dig> list of most expressed snornas in the two respective samples . the present study however, was mainly focused on microrna expression therefore snornas are not investigated in details.

the high throughput sequencing results were further subjected to validation of candidate mirna expression by rt-qpcr. most of the mirna candidates are falling into highly abundant or up/down regulated micrornas in the necrotic sample, however the two mirnas: mir-15a and mir- <dig> were chosen due to their biological relevance as reported in the literature disregarding their rather low read count . the snord <dig> is the third highest expressed snornas, up-regulated in the necrotic sample . the ncrnas chosen for rt-qpcr validation were: mir-15a, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-142-5p, mir-143-3p, mir-144*, mir-146a-5p, mir-148a, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-664-5p, mir-d <dig> and snord <dig>  ten of the candidates were highly expressed in both samples  of which seven were found differentially expressed by rnaseq . mir-664-5p is an interesting case of a so called snor-like microrna  <cit> . the annotation procedure assigns both mir-664-5p and snord <dig> to the same locus. for this reason mir-664-5p is neither featured among micrornas nor among snornas . 

qpcr validation of candidate microrna expression
high throughput data demand validation of particular candidates by a technique with higher specificity and sensitivity like rt-qpcr. in this study, sybr green rt-qpcr was used to verify the expression of  <dig> select micrornas and one snorna. within  <dig> micrornas,  <dig> are annotated in mirbase and one is a novel microrna discovered in the present study. additionally, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were used as rt-qpcr reference genes.

in addition to rna isolated from visually unaffected and necrotic tissues, rna from the demarcation zone , and from nose and trachea originating from the same infection study were included in the rt-qpcr studies. moreover, developmental lung  were included in order to obtain microrna expression profiles across tissues present in the respiratory tract as well as across developing uninfected lung tissue. the data for trachea, nose, f <dig>  and f <dig> are not included in the main manuscript however the diagram including all the tissues is present in additional file  <dig>  to simplify the graphical representation of microrna expression profiles we have included results from adult  control lung, necrotic area, demarcation zone and visually unaffected area only . for data representation, expression in the control sample was set to zero.

the anova performed on log <dig> transformed relative quantities revealed significant differences in the ncrna expression between the analyzed tissues. as mentioned above, illumina gaiix high throughput sequencing was performed on pools of visually unaffected and necrotic sample only. rt-qpcr, on the other hand provides additional, complementing results for the demarcation zone as well as a control sample group. taking the nature of the demarcation zone sample  we would expect the intermediate microrna expression rates. the expression levels of all assayed micrornas but one and of the snorna in the demarcation zone sample are intermediate in relation to the visually unaffected and necrotic areas.

we arranged the expression profiles of the genes selected for rt-qpcr in five groups.

group 1: micrornas up-regulated in all or some of the infected samples compared to control , mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-664-5p, mir-d <dig>  snord15), . all of the above micrornas and snorna show significant up-regulation of expression in necrotic vs. visually unaffected sample. such level of relative expression  is highly comparable to number of reads  for each of the above six ncrnas.

group 2: micrornas down-regulated in necrotic comparing to visually unaffected areas and/or control sample . the read counts for mir- <dig> also showed significantly lower number of counts for the necrotic sample in comparison to the unaffected sample. mir- <dig> has the highest expression in control sample, which decreases significantly with the necrosis progression. mir- <dig> has a slightly different profile with all the infected samples having significantly lower expression than the control sample but at the same time the expression does not differ significantly between samples representing various stages of infection .

group 3: micrornas down-regulated in control followed by up-regulation in visually unaffected and down-regulation again in necrotic sample . despite the decreasing trend, the expression for mir-142-5p and mir-148a, in the necrotic sample remains significantly higher than in the control. in contrary, mir-143-3p makes a slight exception by having the expression in necrotic area down-regulated significantly compared to the control. expression profile of mir-142-5p similarly shows lower read count number in visually unaffected vs. necrotic sample obtained by sequencing. surprisingly the differential expression detected by rt-qpcr does not confirm the lack of significant differences for the mir-148a and mir- <dig> shown by rnaseq data.

group 4: microrna highly up-regulated in infected samples vs. control, showing no differences between the different sampled areas from infected lung . among all unique qpcr candidates, mir-15a represents an exclusive profile of very low expression in the control sample, followed by remarkable up-regulation  in all  <dig> samples originating from the infection study. no significant difference of the mir-15a expression has been detected between the infected samples , which is also reflected in the rnaseq results.

group 5: two micrornas showed no significant difference  between the investigated tissues or a slightly significant difference  between control and visually unaffected area . in contrary, the rnaseq results show up-regulation of mir-146a-5p placing it within  <dig> most regulated micrornas in necrotic sample. mir- <dig> is by far, the most expressed of all the assayed micrornas, showing very high, stable expression in the lung tissue, regardless the presence/degree or absence of infection. however, according to read counts mir- <dig> is placed as the second most abundant transcript, right after mir- <dig>  furthermore, the relative expression of mir- <dig> detected by rnaseq points towards up-regulation of this micrornas in visually unaffected sample in comparison to the necrotic sample .

target predictions of micrornas
regardless of the limited understanding of microrna function, microrna target predictions point out mrnas possibly regulated by individual mirnas. we combined  human data from four of the prominent target prediction methods sources namely: targetscan  <cit> , pictar  <cit> , miranda  <cit>  and microt  <cit> . we only included conserved mirnas and conserved targets. the merged data contained  <dig> , <dig> predicted interactions between  <dig>  proteins and  <dig> mirnas. a total of  <dig>  predicted protein/mirna targets were in agreement with two or more of the four methods and these constituted our conservative set. for further mirna target investigation, the range of possible targets of interest was narrowed down to  <dig> transcripts coding for proteins based on the available literature regarding micrornas in bacterial infection, immunological response and cell death  <cit> ,  <cit>  as well as the transcriptional profiling performed at different sites of lungs in pigs during acute bacterial respiratory infection  <cit> ,  <cit> . moreover, the set of micrornas subjected to mrna predictions was limited to  <dig> microrna candidates validated by rt-qpcr . these  <dig> micrornas are all conserved in human as are the proteins targeted by them and we therefore assume that the microrna-protein interaction is conserved as well.

overlap of the mrna and mirna predictions resulted in  <dig> predicted interactions for the  <dig> proteins with the  <dig> mirnas of which  <dig> interactions  are predicted by two or more methods and are shown in additional file  <dig> 

the mirna candidates assayed by rt-qpcr are found to target multiple mrnas as shown in table  <dig>  two out of  <dig> micrornas  included in table  <dig> are predicted to target more than  <dig> different mrnas. the following five mirnas , target over ten different protein coding genes. mir-142-5p, mir-148a and mir- <dig> target over five mrnas, whereas only two predictions were found for mir- <dig> 

only widely conserved target sites included. ** indicate target predicted by two or more algorithms. bold and underlined protein coding gene symbol indicate mirna:mrna interaction featured in starbase which includes clip-seq experimental validation.

the target predictions for the  <dig> novel mirnas were performed with targetscan against human 3’ utrs, keeping only the widely conserved target sites. for the novel mirnas we found a total of  <dig>  targets. only eight out of  <dig>  predicted interactions target mrna within the selected  <dig> proteins and these are: cyp26b1: mir-d <dig>  ilf3: mir-d <dig>  mcl1: mir-d <dig>  pak2: mir-d <dig>  mir-d <dig>  mir-d <dig>  smad7: mir-d <dig>  socs5: mir-d <dig>  the highly expressed novel mirna mir-d <dig> was found to target only five transcripts, which is an unusual low number compared to the others. this characteristic is shared with mir-d <dig> and it is likely because both mirnas are linage specific and not found in human  which also explains why their targets are missing from the set of widely conserved target sites. all targets without consideration of conservation of the target sites are given in additional file  <dig>  however, since the pig is not part of the targetscan data set while cow is, we chose to use the cow 3’ utrs. thus, we found no targets of particular interest mostly due to only partial sequence conservation of both mir-d <dig> and mir-d11between pig and cow.

discussion
in the present study we have mainly been interested in investigation of micrornas involved in the progression of the app infection rather than comparing infected versus healthy individuals. furthermore, we decided to use infected and visually uninfected tissue from pigs infected with the bacterial pathogen actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in order to minimize the genetic and phenotypic diversity between samples. we have used these samples to generate expression profiles of microrna by high throughput. working with infected tissue, which shows severe signs of advanced necrosis, is challenging because rna degradation has to be taken into account. as expected, the annotation of the rnaseq data revealed a dominating presence of degradation products in the necrotic sample, regardless of the fact that all the samples included in the present study showed rna quality indexes acceptable for gene expression studies . the read length distribution in the visually unaffected sample is comparable to profiles generated in other studies  <cit> ,  <cit>  with the highest number of reads belonging to the 19-25nt microrna range which suggests the reliability of the library construction and the sequencing. a meaningful expression profile can only be generated if the raw reads are normalized in accordance to the degree of degradation. to avoid letting rrna and mrna degradation products over-shadow the read counts of the mirnas among the reads generated in the necrotic sample, the mirnas from both samples were studied separately. two different mapping methods have been used in this study: one with unique reads using novoalign  <cit> , and one with matches to maximum five genomic loci using bowtie. the results generated by the two methods are in strong agreement with each other.

the sequencing data provide evidence of microrna deregulation during lung infection with the bacterial pathogen. both up- and down-regulation of micrornas were found when comparing the expression in the necrotic versus visually unaffected tissue of the lung. a subset of the highly expressed and biologically relevant genes  was subjected to rt-qpcr. in  <dig> out of  <dig> genes, rt-qpcr results supported the results obtained by deep-sequencing indicating that the data generated reflects a biologically meaningful profile. the disagreement featured in the remaining four micrornas is most likely pointing towards sequencing bias accompanying rnaseq experiments rather than misevaluation of the expression by a specific and sensitive rt-qpcr.

the number of annotated micrornas in domestic pig in the newest mirbase  <dig>  is still much smaller than in other organisms, featuring  <dig> entries for human,  <dig> for mouse and only  <dig> for pig. multiple alignments to the pig genome and  <dig> other organisms were performed based on the assumption that the majority of mirna sequences are conserved among species  <cit> ,  <cit> . a total of  <dig> of the annotated  <dig> micrornas matched hairpins annotated for other organisms than pig in mirbase and based on sequence homology they could be annotated in pig enriching the repertoire of porcine micrornas by  <dig> homologous mirnas. furthermore,  <dig> novel micrornas were found by search performed with mirdeep <dig> pipeline  <cit>  <cit> . often, novel micrornas are not represented by many read counts. an exception to that rule is one of the detected mirnas, annotated at the negative strand of chromosome  <dig>  called – mir-d <dig>  which is represented by  <dig> and  <dig> read counts in necrotic and visually unaffected sample, respectively. moreover, this novel microrna was found in only two other organisms: cow and dolphin out of the  <dig> different reference genomes tested.

studies on high throughput sequencing of small rnas show that there are in most cases a few distinct micrornas that constitute the majority of microrna reads  <cit> . our study also reports highly abundant microrna namely mir- <dig> which is represented by 65% and 49% of the mirna reads in the visually unaffected and the necrotic sample, respectively. rt-qpcr validation of this microrna did, not reflect such a high level of expression. even more striking is the fact that this particular microrna has not previously been described as extremely abundant in mammalian lung, neither has it been pointed out as a major regulator of immune response  <cit> . a possible explanation for the high read count in both libraries could be that during the library construction an artifact has been introduced in the rnaseq experiment.

the second most abundant microrna in both samples – mir- <dig> is involved in many biological scenarios  <cit> . in the present study, mir- <dig> shows down-regulation in the necrotic sample in comparison to the visually unaffected one, however supported by quite low p-values . rt-qpcr performed on mir- <dig> detected the highest expression level of all the assayed micrornas. no differential expression was found between the samples included in the rt-qpcr experiment, which could indicate an important role of mir- <dig> in the homeostasis of lung.

the  <dig> microrna candidates assayed by rt-qpcr were investigated for target predictions in order to provide more insight into the biological pathways where the different micrornas could play a role. the conservative predictions indeed anticipated a number of very promising, biologically interesting interactions. one of the major factors involved in detection of pathogens and initiation of inflammatory response are tlrs. moreover, a rapid immune response is triggered upon pathogen invasion by the presence of lpss – a major component of the gram negative app membranes. after binding of lps to the tlr4/md2/cd <dig> receptor complex, signalling pathways lead to the activation of nuclear factor κb  that further regulates a large set of genes critical to cell proliferation, inflammation and innate immunity  <cit> . literature reports a number of micrornas, mainly mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-146a, mir- <dig> to be important regulators of the protein coding genes involved in the above mentioned pathways  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> . studies on microrna expression in bacterial infections of various sources similarly point towards the same micrornas  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit>  as the key players in the host response. we found  <dig> micrornas up regulated in necrotic versus visually unaffected sample, while the protein coding study on the same biological material found that the highest number of deregulated genes was in the necrotic area  <cit> . the micrornas showing remarkably high expression level in our study namely mir- <dig> is a powerful anti-inflammatory regulator, which by direct targeting of a pdcd <dig> gene inhibits the pro-inflammatory regulator nf-kb. moreover, the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> are increased upon mir- <dig> up-regulation  <cit> . however, our study detected an extremely high expression of mir- <dig> in all the samples, regardless the infection status. similar results of high expression of mir- <dig> have been found in viral infection of porcine dendritic cells  <cit> .

two targets of mir-21: interleukin i beta  and tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein  <dig> , which is rapidly induced by the tnf were assayed by rt-qpcr on mrna in another app infection study in pigs  <cit> . in the study of mortensen and collaborators il1β was up-regulated in infected samples and tnfaip <dig> was repressed. ideally, we would expect an up-regulation of microrna while mrna is attenuated and vice versa. however, the lack of such correlation is not necessarily contradictive to the nature of microrna mediated regulation. a single mrna can be fine-tuned by multiple micrornas and this regulation is a very complex, multi-factorial and time dependent network and possibly samples taken at different time points of infection would result in slightly different profiles.

the following key player in control of immunity and inflammation, mir- <dig>  showed rather contradicting results to those existing in the literature  <cit> ;  <cit> ;  <cit> . in our rt-qpcr study, mir- <dig> was significantly down-regulated under pathogen triggered inflammation and so was mrna coding for the mir- <dig> target ifn-γ in the same animals  <cit> .

the 5b app serotype used in the present study is highly virulent. it has been show that the lethality of pleuropneumonia in pigs is not necessarily caused by ventilator failure  <cit>  but by a septic shock-like condition, which develops when, immunological and inflammatory responses are unbalanced and uncontrolled release of cytokines occurs  <cit> . such dramatic disturbance in regulation of immune response could be the explanation for the surprisingly reversed mir- <dig> expression profile.

another microrna candidate namely mir- <dig> was investigated in the present study. we indeed detected a remarkable, gradually increasing expression of mir- <dig> with infection progression, in infected samples in comparison to the control. moreover, matsushima and co-workers  found mir- <dig> to be the only up-regulated microrna in helicobacter pylori-infected gastric mucosa. tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> pathways are possibly targeted by mir- <dig>  <cit> .

nearly all up-regulated micrornas in lung tissue from infected pigs target il-6r and/or il6st, in addition mir- <dig> and mir-146a 5p targets mrna coding for il- <dig>  il- <dig> was found to be highly up-regulated in the same animals  <cit>  14–18 h after experimental infection. we might speculate that expression of this pro-inflammatory cytokine as well as its receptor will be tightly regulated in order to avoid host mediated tissue damage. unpublished time-course studies of mrna from lung tissue reveal il- <dig> first to be highly up-regulated and then to be significant down-regulated somewhere between  <dig> and 24 h after infection with app  microrna mir-148a and mir- <dig> are also mentioned in the inflammation related literature with mir-148a having implication in function of primary bronchial epithelial cells  <cit>  and mir- <dig> in chronic asthma where initial increase in expression of this microrna was found  <cit> . the mir-148a similarly to mir-146a-5p was found to target mrna encoding irak <dig>  our most confident prediction for mir-148a is a smad <dig> gene involved in regulation of cell growth and proliferation - two processes which are rather silenced during stressful bacterial infection. this corresponds to great up-regulation of mir-148a in infected tissue. interestingly, interleukin  <dig> receptor  is regulated by mir- <dig>  interleukin  <dig> is yet another immunoregulatory cytokine though to be involved in transition from innate to adaptive immunity. the remaining microrna candidates namely: mir-15a, -142-5p, - <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig> were not previously described as important in response to infectious pathogen lung infection. nevertheless, we provide a very distinct and significant expression profiles supported by multiple target predictions for those micrornas, which suggest that they might be a new coming group of micrornas involved in inflammation regulatory networks.

CONCLUSIONS
this is to our knowledge the first study to survey the host microrna expression profiles in actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae lung infection in pig. we provide insight into involvement of a collection of micrornas in regulation of immune and inflammatory response during porcine lung infection. a number of those micrornas have not previously been described as regulators of immune system, which might point towards their possible organ specific, infection time specific or species specific role. furthermore, the atlas of annotated and novel porcine micrornas expressed in different areas of infected lungs is described. the complexity of the microrna-target regulation suggests that the network should be rather viewed as a multi-factorial structure that fine-tunes plasticity of inflammation rather than a set of isolated regulatory events. we believe that better understanding of the possible role of micrornas modulating prr signaling in response to pathogens, by targeting different components of these complex pathways firstly contributes to better understanding of the complex regulation and secondly may contribute to drug improvements in the future. this study builds a background for mirna-target interaction based-research in app infection in pig. furthermore, the findings of the present study combined with translational studies can contribute to elucidate mechanisms responsible for susceptibility to and pathophysiology of lung infection in other organisms including humans.
