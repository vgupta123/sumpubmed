BACKGROUND
solanum elaeagnifolium  is a perennial weed of the family solanaceae, native to north mexico and south usa  <cit> , now extended to nearly all the mediterranean  <cit> . the weed constitutes a big threat to major crops such as cotton, wheat and tomato, while it endangers city parks in metropolitan areas. its highly invasive nature is due to its fine adaptation to diverse environmental and soil conditions , and its reproductive mode which includes both sexual reproduction by seeds and asexual reproduction by underground regenerating buds  <cit> . s. elaeagnifolium plants are also hosts to several dangerous plant viruses like potato virus y   <cit>  and tomato yellow leaf curl virus   <cit> .

although s. elaeagnifolium fruit is toxic to many animals  <cit> , whole plant extracts were recently shown to exhibit analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities  <cit> . many of these functions were attributed to the high amount of phytosterols, which amounted to more than  <dig> % of the plant’s extract  <cit> . sterols belong to the large family of plant terpenes whose biosynthesis in plants is extremely important due to their role as phytohormones and photosynthesis pigments but more importantly as mediators of plant’s interaction with a variety of biotic and abiotic factors. tomato breeding has been focused lately in improving the biosynthetic pathways that lead to the production of terpenes in an effort to increase herbivore resistance  <cit> . wild solanum species are considered a valuable source of genetic variability towards this goal  <cit> . plant terpenes are produced by prenyl diphosphates, such as dimethylallyl diphosphate , geranyl diphosphate , farnesyl diphosphate , and geranylgeranyl diphosphate , via two pathways, the mva pathway and the mep pathway  <cit> . sesquiterpenes  and triterpenes  are produced by the cytosolic mva pathway while monoterpenes  and diterpenes  are produced by the plastidial mep pathway. however, in solanum species the production of many monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes rather derives from gpp, -fpp and neryl diphosphate  located in the plastids . prenyl diphosphates are the substrates on which the enzymes responsible for the production of terpenes act. the specific enzymes are tpss and expression of their coding genes is frequently induced in response to biotic and abiotic stress  <cit> . plant terpenes are implicated in a variety of plant processes such as the formation of plant hormones gibberellins  and abscisic acid , the production of phytoalexins, allelopathic substances  <cit>  and substances that attract pollinators or repel herbivores  <cit> . tomato terpenes, which have been studied extensively, are abundant in the glandular trichomes of leaves, stems, young fruits and flower parts.

although s. elaeagnifolium is a species that gained significant agronomic and scientific attention, only  <dig> expressed sequence tags  sequences exist in genbank. at the molecular level, it was only recently that specific est- simple sequence repeat  molecular markers were developed and used for estimating the genetic diversity of s. elaeagnifolium natural accessions collected from nine sites of southeastern australia  <cit> . ssr markers from other solanum species have been used before for estimating the genetic variability of s. elaeagnifolium populations  <cit> . transcriptome analyses of species such as tomato , pepper  and tobacco  have shown that a high level of sequence conservation exists among solanaceae  <cit> .

in this study aiming to obtain transcriptome sequences, next-generation sequencing was performed in a pool of mrnas isolated from s. elaeagnifolium leaves and flowers. by the use of computational methods transcript abundance was estimated. to assess aspects of stress resistance in s. elaeagnifolium, terpene biosynthesis associated with stresses and the plant’s response to leaf wounding was examined. in this context, two terpene synthases were isolated and characterized in yeast, a monoterpene synthase mostly producing camphene and lesser amounts of β-myrcene and limonene, and a sesquiterpene synthase producing mostly caryophyllene and lesser α-humulene. leaf wounding experiments showed both transcriptional induction and caryophyllene production in wounded tissues.

RESULTS
high-throughput sequencing and transcriptome assembly
the sequencing output of s. elaeagnifolium flowers and leaves mrna is shown in table  <dig>  clean reads were assembled into contigs using trinity  <cit> . then the reads were mapped back to contigs. an amount of  <dig>  contigs were generated with a mean length of  <dig> nucleotides  . contigs were re-assembled into  <dig>  unigenes with mean length of  <dig>  nt . for a detailed graph of contigs and unigenes length see additional file 1: figure s <dig>  a total of  <dig>  clusters  were created from unigenes while  <dig>  unigenes remained as singletons .table  <dig> results of illumina sequencing

functional characterization of unigenes
based on basic local alignment search tool  searches in the non-redundant  database at ncbi , the majority of s. elaeagnifolium unigenes  shares similarity with grape sequences while less than  <dig> % of sequences shares similarity with other solanaceae sequences . most unigenes  show significant similarity above  <dig> % with nr entries from which  <dig>  % exceeds  <dig> % similarity.fig.  <dig> percentage distribution of s. elaeagnifolium sequences based on their blast similarity with nr database. the percentages of s. elaeagnifolium unigenes similar to sequences deposited in nr database, from various plant species, are referred



all unigenes were employed in blastx searches against the nr, swiss-prot, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes , gene ontology  and clusters of orthologous groups  databases with an e-value of 10− <dig>  the information obtained was used to extract coding dna sequence  from unigenes and translate them into amino acid sequences. the cds of unigenes that had no blastx hit was predicted based on the estscan results and their translation into amino acid sequences; these unigenes were singificantly less than those whose prediction of cds was based on blast results. the predicted cds length  was less than  <dig> nt with the majority of cds being approximately  <dig> nt size.

among the  <dig>  unigenes with one at least go-term given,  <dig>  % were annotated in the biological process,  <dig>  % in the cellular component and  <dig>  % in the molecular function . furthermore  <dig>  unigenes were classified in  <dig> cog functional categories. for most of the unigenes only a general function prediction is possible  while the next most abundant categories are transcription , replication, recombination and repair  and signal transduction mechanisms  .

expression of unigenes
transcript abundances were estimated for s. elaeagnifolium unigenes by the rsem software  <cit> . the complete list of the  <dig> most expressed genes in s. elaeagnifolium leaves and flowers is presented in table  <dig>  the comparison of s. elaeagnifolium leaf and flower transcriptome expression results of the present study, produced by rsem analysis, with other solanaceae transcriptomes has shown that the majority of the most abundant transcripts are common inside the family. for instance, the most abundant transcripts in s. elaeagnifolium leaves and flowers encode a putative subunit of the ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase  protein, a rubisco activase, putative lipid-transfer proteins, proteins involved in chlorophyl binding and photosystem i and ii, a s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase  etc. most of these transcripts are universally identified as strongly expressed in solanum databases   <cit> . transcripts strongly expressed that code for metallothioneins  are also found. mts are proteins that bind metal ions and are classified in four classes/types depending on the amount and the arrangement of their cysteine-rich domains  <cit> . mt proteins are known to respond to metal presence but also may play a role in reactive oxygen species detoxification  that catalyzes the formation of d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate  and dihydroxyacetone phosphate  from fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate . two plastidic aldolases from species n. paniculata were found in the leaves of this plant known for its tolerance in low-water conditions  <cit> . s. elaeagnifolium gene shares a high homology  with these genes both responding also to salt stress  <cit> .table  <dig> the  <dig> most expressed genes in s.elaeagnifolium leaves and flowers


the annotation  is based on the annotation of the top hit produced by blastx searches at the ncbi protein database. all top hits are solanaceae proteins . fpkm  values produced by rsem software 



third in abundance is a s. elaeagnifolium transcript  that presents  <dig> % homology to a tomato pathogenesis-related  protein . a similar pr protein is produced by another abundant transcript  that is highly similar to a tomato gene  annotated as pr1a gene. both transcripts are significantly higher expressed in s. elaeagnifolium than their corresponding tomato and potato putative orthologs. the potato ortholog pr <dig> gene  was isolated from p. infestans infected leaves and is induced significantly under pathogen and elicitor attack although it is expressed under normal conditions as well. the second s. elaeagnifolium transcript, cl <dig>  is highly similar to tomato pr <dig> precursor  that is not expressed at all in tomato flowers or leaves while the corresponding potato gene, a pr1-like gene  has low expression in potato flowers and leaves. cl <dig> deduced protein sequence shares  <dig> % identity with pepper pr <dig> precursor protein that was found to be induced under bacteria infection and possibly linked with the stimulation of ethylene synthesis  <cit> .

finally, one more highly expressed transcript, cl9787_ <dig>  shares significant similarity with a ht-b gene from s. peruvianum, a gene involved in the self-incompatibility of wild solanum genera and is not expressed in self compatible species like s. lycopersicum  <cit> . the strong expression of the gene in s. elaeagnifolium provides molecular evidence for the outcrossing of the species, common in wild solanums. s. elaeagnifolium has another probable ht gene  that is also expressed in flowers and leaves but lower than cl9787_ <dig> 

identification of genes involved in terpene biosynthesis in s. elaeagnifolium
plants use a number of secondary metabolites to cope with their abiotic and biotic environment and terpenes lie in the first line of plant defence against the risks posed. not only terpenes are responsible for the biosynthesis of necessary hormones that facilitate plant responses, but oxidative and thermal stresses are also alleviated by terpene production  <cit> . furthermore, some monoterpenes have been implicated in allelopathic effects  <cit> . because of the importance of plant terpenes in a plethora of biological processes related to stress responses and since s. elaeagnifolium is a resiliant species that grows even on degraded soils, emphasis was laid on this group of secondary metabolites.

employing blast suite of programs on s. elaeagnifolium unigenes, genes of the mva and mep pathways likely to participate in the biosynthesis of terpene precursors, as long as tps genes were identified. the complete list of the putative genes involved in the mva and mep pathways is included in table  <dig>  genes for key enzymes, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase   and dxs  have  multiple paralogues that are all expressed significantly in leaves and flowers. putative s. elaeagnifolium acetoacetyl coa thiolase  , hmgr <dig>  and 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyl-transferase   genes are present in the transcriptome as multiple alleles. also genes involved in prenyl diphosphate synthesis, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase  and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase , also have many paralogues. finally, several putative cis-prenyltransferase genes  believed to be involved in the biosynthesis of long-chain polyisoprenoids were also identified in s. elaeagnifolium. two of them  have homology to cpt <dig>  for the complete list of the putative s. elaeagnifolium tps genes identified in leaves and flowers, see table in additional file 4: table s <dig> table  <dig> the s. elaeagnifolium putative orthologs of tomato genes involved in the mva, mep pathways, the prenyl phosphate metabolism and the biosynthesis of polyisoprenoids

three tps genes , the putative hmgr <dig> gene , and the dxs <dig> gene  were selected for further analysis. the specific tps genes were selected for study because they are putatively involved in the production of all three major classes of terpenes, mono-, di- and sesqui- terpenes. hmgr and dxs code for critical enzymes of the two terpene biosynthesis pathways  <cit> . according to blast results, hmgr <dig> has three alleles; three contigs that belong to the cluster cl <dig>  cl <dig> contigs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> % similarity with tomato hmgr <dig> and all have significant fpkm values in the pooled mrna from leaves and flowers . on the contrary, unigene <dig> is the only s. elaeagnifolium sequence that has high homology  with a tomato characterized dxs gene .

for the putative tps genes, transcript cl <dig> is a cluster of eight sequences. analysis of the sequences included in cl <dig> indicates alternative splicing events taking place during the transcription of the corresponding gene. the different transcripts differ in three regions: in the first, four sequences have a  <dig> nt insertion, in the second, four sequences have a  <dig> nt insertion and in the last, four sequences have a  <dig> nt insertion. none of the inserted sequences has an open reading frame  indicative of functional proteins. only one transcript/sequence of  <dig>  nt contains a  <dig>  nt putative cds sequence that codes for a full  <dig> amino acid protein. the sequence, named hereafter cl <dig>  is the one with the highest fpkm value in flowers and leaves  while the other seven transcripts/sequences have lowest fpkm values.

the alignment of cl <dig> predicted protein sequence with closely related tomato proteins tps9-sesquiterpene synthase  <dig> , tps <dig> and tps <dig>   shows a high conservation of amino acids throughout their length . tps <dig> and tps <dig> are known and characterized sesquiterpene synthases. the deduced cl <dig> protein contains the ddxxd and nse/dte motifs  that characterize tps proteins.fig.  <dig> alignment of s. elaeagnifolium deduced amino acid sequences with their related tomato proteins. a tomato tps <dig>  tps <dig> and tps <dig> and the cl <dig> predicted protein alignment. tps <dig>  and tps <dig>  are closely related. transcript cl <dig> from s. elaeagnifolium resembles both and tps <dig>  the motif ddxxd, engaged in cofactor binding is fully conserved in the four proteins. the nse/dte motif is present as divghee following its general form dxxxxe  <cit> ; the fifth amino acid is a glycine  instead of serine  or threonine . the alignment was created by clustalw and edited with jalview. amino acids that share the same coloring have similar biochemical properties. b tomato tps <dig> and cl <dig> predicted protein alignment. the parts of the alignment depicted contain the motifs ddxxd  and nse/dte 



the second putative tps gene in study, cl <dig>  is a cluster of  <dig> sequences. however according to rsem analysis only two of them are expressed above a fpkm threshold of  <dig>  the two sequences differ only in a  <dig> nt insertion, indicating that one could correspond to an incompletely spliced transcript. the sequence of  <dig>  nt that contains no intron sequence and has the highest expression in flowers and leaves, was analyzed and annotated hereafter as cl <dig>  cl <dig> possess a predicted cds of  <dig>  nt that codes for a  <dig> amino acids protein. the predicted protein shares  <dig> % similarity with the predicted ent-kaurene synthase  protein from potato ,  <dig> % similarity with tomato tps24-ks protein   and  <dig> % similarity with n. attenuata ks protein . the alignment of tomato tps24-ks protein with the predicted cl <dig> amino acid sequence showed that the s. elaeagnifolium protein also contains the aspartate-rich ddxxd and nse/dte motifs both identical to tomato tps24-ks corresponding motifs .

the third tps gene identified, transcript cl <dig> is a cluster of  <dig> sequences but only one is expressed in leaves and flowers; it contains a  <dig>  nt putative cds sequence that encodes a  <dig> amino acid full protein. the protein shares  <dig> % similarity with tomato tps <dig> protein, a monoterpene camphene/tricyclene synthase  and a putative camphene/tricyclene synthase from potato .

functional characterization of s. elaeagnifolium putative tps genes in yeast cells
the yeast strain am <dig>  <cit>  was used to transform cl <dig> putative monoterpene synthase together with the erg <dig>  variant which shifts production towards gpp substrate  <cit> . for the expression of cl <dig>  the gene was co-expressed in am <dig> cells together with copalyl diphosphate synthase from salvia pomifera and a variant of yeast erg <dig>  producing ggpp. for the characterization of the putative sesquiterpene cl <dig>  the yeast strain am <dig> was used  <cit> . the cl <dig> carrying plasmid was transformed either alone or together with a stabilised variant of hmg <dig> to increase substrate availability  <cit> . as seen in fig. 3a, cl <dig> is an active monoterpene synthase enzyme producing a range of monoterpenes with the most prominent being camphene , β-myrcene  and limonene  and several minor additional compounds. the cl <dig> expressing cells did not produce any compounds. the cl <dig> enzyme was active and less promiscuous than cl <dig>  producing mainly caryophyllene  and lesser amounts of α-humulene . the caryophyllene peak was additionally validated with the mass spectrum of a standard compound.fig.  <dig> gc/ms chromatograms. a gc/ms chromatogram with the substances produced by cl <dig> expressed in yeast. b gc/ms chromatogram of the dodecane phase of yeast culture. the major product seems to be caryophyllene  as its peak area percentage reflexes a higher amount compared to α-humulene  which is also produced by yeast



gas chromatography/mass spectrometry  analysis of wounded leaves
gc/ms qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis was carried out for collected leaves,  <dig> hours  after their mechanical wounding. unwounded leaves were also collected. the results are given in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  in particular, each leaf extract component is cited and accompanied by its retention time and a peak area percentage calculated by the gc/ms solution software. table  <dig> shows the common compounds detected both in unwounded and wounded leaves. wounding can significantly affect the concentration of substances which are mainly aldehydes, ketones and alcohols.table  <dig> common compounds in unwounded and wounded leaves as resulted from gc/ms analysis

wounded leaves were harvested  <dig> h after wounding. unwounded leaves were harvested in the same time



the substances induced in wounded leaves are included in table  <dig>  what is interesting to point out is that the majority of the compounds with peak area over  <dig>  % are aldehydes previously associated with wounding responses. -caryophyllene is also induced by the wounding procedure as it was detected in the gc/ms chromatogram of the wounded leaves at  <dig>  min. from fig.  <dig>  it is obvious that the characteristic peaks of -jasmone and -caryophyllene occur only in the chromatogram of the wounded leaves. the presence of -caryophyllene and geranyl linalool in wounded leaves was also validated by comparing both the peak retention times and mass spectra between the unknown samples and standards. the mass spectra of the later as acquired from unknown samples are illustrated in figures in additional file 5: figure s <dig> and additional files 6: figure s <dig> respectiverly, with typical mass fragments at m/z  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> for -caryophyllene and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> for geranyl linalool respectively.fig.  <dig> comparative gc/ms chromatographs for unwounded  and wounded leaves . indicated peaks  <dig> and  <dig> correspond to -jasmone and -caryophyllene respectively



wounding and tps expression
since gc/ms analysis conducted in wounded leaves showed the rise in the synthesis of the sesquiterpene -caryophyllene, the expression of cl <dig> identified as caryophyllene synthase, was studied in real-time pcr experiments. given that no monoterpene compounds were detected in the extractions of wounded leaves, the expression of cl <dig> was not studied. what was studied was the expression of cl <dig> - putative ks, of unigene <dig> - putative dxs <dig> and of cl <dig> - putative hmgr <dig> along with the allene oxide cyclase  gene, a gene involved in the formation of jasmonic acid  and quickly induced by wounding in tomato leaves  <cit> . primers were designed to amplify the specific contigs of each of the clusters cl <dig> and cl <dig>  while for cluster cl <dig> primers were designed to amplify a common region of all three alleles.

as shown in fig.  <dig>  wounding of s. elaeagnifolium leaves induced the expression of the s. elaeagnifolium aoc homolog gene in all time points tested, providing evidence that plants undertake responses related to the wounding stress. the expression of sesquiterpene - caryophyllene synthase gene cl <dig> was increased in all wounding time points compared to the control, the unwounded leaves . the increase in the expression of cl <dig> was quickly recorded at the time point  <dig> min after wounding. yet the most pronounced increase in the expression of the caryophyllene synthase cl <dig> was  <dig> h after wounding where the gene was expressed nearly  <dig> times significantly more than in the control. at the last time point,  <dig> h after wounding, the cl <dig> expression was still significantly higher than the control but less than in the  <dig> and  <dig> h time points. on the other hand, the expression of unigene <dig> - putative dxs <dig> gene is induced later than that of cl <dig>  however in its peak of expression, also at the  <dig> h after wounding time point, unigene <dig> was expressed  <dig> times more significantly than in the control. interestingly its expression fell sharply reaching the same expression as in the control unwounded leaves at  <dig> h after wounding. the expression of putative hmgr <dig> - cl <dig> and ks - cl <dig> remained unchanged .fig.  <dig>

discussion
the s. elaeagnifolium transcriptome
s. elaeagnifolium mrna from leaves and flowers was sequenced and reads were used to build a de novo s. elaeagnifolium transcriptome. the inclusion of the two tissues in the rnaseq libraries provides a representative sampling of the genes expressed in this wild and unexplored solanum species. from the  <dig>  unigenes assembled nearly  <dig> % was annotated by using the nr database. the percentage of annotated transcripts is similar to the n. benthamiana annotated sequences based on genbank database   <cit> . however the proportions of s. elaeagnifolium unigenes that present matches with sequences in swiss-prot, kegg, cog and go databases were lower:  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. a percentage of  <dig> % of the unigenes had no nr hit, a number lower than the number of transcripts that remained without nr annotation in the de novo sequencing of sweet potato  <cit>  but larger than those without nr annotation in chili pepper  <cit> . the terms “binding and catalytic activity”, “cell and cell part”, “metabolic and cell process” were the most representative of the three main go categories of cellular component, molecular function and biological process, assigned to the assembled s. elaeagnifolium unigenes. similar results were obtained from annotating the transcripts of sweet potato  <cit> . an interesting finding is that  <dig>  % of the s. elaeagnifolium unigenes are classified as “response to stimulus” in the biological process go category. given the species tolerance to environmental stresses, genes involved are probably categorized in this percentage.

transcript quantification estimated by rsem software in s. elaeagnifolium leaves and flowers showed that most of the transcripts expressed amply are universally found to be strongly expressed in other solanum databases, while some are unexpectedly abundant in s. elaeagnifolium leaves and flowers such as the pr transcripts. pr <dig> proteins are known defence-related proteins used by the plants in systemic acquired resistance. the high expression of these two putative pr genes in s. elaeagnifolium may imply that the plant has a priori constitutive defence mechanisms that make it resistant to pathogen attack. the constitutive expression of pr proteins is common in resistant cultivars  <cit>  and has been suggested as a modern breeding goal.

analysis of wounded s.elaeagnifolium leaves
mechanical wounding resulted in the induction of a plethora of important chemical compounds in s. elaeagnifolium leaves. among them, the sesquiterpene -caryophyllene an attractant for natural enemies that parasitize herbivores. recently it was found that caryophyllene has an anti-bacterial activity in flowers of arabidopsis plants  <cit> . furthermore the volatile jasmone was the key compound detected in abundance in our wounded s. elaeagnifolium leaves indicative of the damage done. jasmone, a product of jasmonic acid, is implicated in various aspects of plant defence  <cit> . this finding agrees with the rise in the expression of the ja related, wounding-monitoring aoc gene, recorded in wounded leaves. apart from jasmone, the majority of the rest of the compounds found were aldehydes and ketones. n-nonanal and -2-decanal are common volatile compounds that contribute to aroma in tomato and other fruits. interestingly, nonanal and decanal were also detected in wounded tomato leaves but their concentrations did not vary significantly from unwounded controls  <cit> . nonanal was also found to be induced in damaged poplar leaves  <cit> . -2-decenal from ailanthus altissima was found to have activity towards nematodes of the meloidogyne genus  <cit> . -2-decenal oil from the plant coriandrum sativum was found to have anti-fungal activity as vapor against botrytis, alternaria and geotrichum  <cit> . n-hexadecane, n-heptadecane and n-octadecane are also volatile compounds detected in many plants  <cit> .

geranyl linalool is a diterpene alcohol produced by ggpp via the mep pathway. geranyl linalool further produces the volatile - <dig> ,12-trimethyltrideca- <dig> , <dig> -tetraene , an insect-induced terpene that is released from plants such as arabidopsis and tomato under the attack of herbivores  <cit> . it was shown that in tomato both geranyl linalool and tmtt are induced by ja treatment  <cit> .

terpene related genes and their expression after wounding
as a tentative to isolate genes related to terpene biosynthesis from s. elaeagnifolium we retrieved putative tps genes using blast algorithms. cl <dig> was the one most expressed putative tps. its deduced amino acid sequence shares high homology  with sesquiterpene synthase lycopersicum hirsutum <dig>  protein from s. habrochaites that catalyzes the formation of germacrene d  <cit> . cl <dig> is similar to tomato sesquiterpene synthases genes tps <dig>  tps <dig>  tps <dig> and two sstlh from s. habrochaites. tps <dig> synthesizes β-caryophyllene and α-humulene  <cit> . cl <dig> is wounding-responsive in s.elaeagnifolium leaves. its induced expression that peaked  <dig> h after wounding suggests that probably this gene is involved in the defence plant system. in agreement with this increase in cl <dig> transcriptomic activity,  <dig> h after wounding, cg/ms analysis has certified the increase in -caryophyllene emission in wounded leaves  <dig> h after the cl <dig> transcription peak, making highly probable that cl <dig> is actually the gene responsible for the production of caryophyllene in s. elaeagnifolium. the particular finding is in accordance with the results in yeast cells showing that the expression of cl <dig> produces -caryophyllene. a -caryophyllene synthase in maize was increased after attack in roots by diabrotica virgifera larvae and in leaves by spodoptera littoralis. the gene has a breeding value since it is low expressed in north american maize cultivars while it is higher in european ones  <cit> . cotton roots that have been treated with methyl-jasmonate also show an increase in a tps that produces -caryophyllene indicative of the involvement of this gene in herbivory attack defense systems  <cit> . a similar wounding-responsive profile is also adopted by the s. elaeagnifolium putative dxs gene - unigene2314; its expression is even more pronounced than tps cl <dig> but it drops more drastically as the time after wounding proceeds. dxs is a gene involved in the mep pathway, residing in the chloroplasts normally involved in monoterpenoid production  and diterpene production . normally the knockdown of dxs <dig> leads to the production of more sesquiterpenes than monoterpenes in tomato  <cit>  but work in s. habrochaites has shown that sesquiterpenes may also be produced in the chloroplasts  <cit> . there is also evidence that ipp and dmapp may be transferred from the chloroplasts to the cytosol so that such dxs produced precursors are integrated to sesquiterpenes  <cit> . in the present wounding experiment the non-induced putative hmgr <dig> combined with the high induced putative dxs <dig> and tps <dig>  showed that probably in s. elaeagnifolium the mep pathway provides more terpenoid precursors for the production of sesquiterpenes than the mva pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
s. elaeagnifolium is an important invasive species and a serious threat for crops in several areas around the world. here, a leaves and flowers transcriptome was generated by next-generation sequencing, identifying  <dig>  unigenes with mean length of  <dig>  nt. analysis of transcript abundance showed several genes associated with stress resistance. some of them such as pr-like genes were uniquely abundant to s. elaeagnifolium. leaf wounding experiments showed induction of numerous aldehydes, most of them known to participate in biotic stress resistance. additionally, two terpenes, -caryophyllene and geranyl linalool were detected in wounded tissues. analysis of identified full length tps genes identified a caryophyllene synthase and a camphene synthase. real-time pcr confirmed the up-regulation of the caryophyllene synthase upon wounding and putative dxs <dig> which could relate to geranyl linalool and -caryophyllene.
