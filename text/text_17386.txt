BACKGROUND
organelle motility is an essential function of all cells. the shuttling of supramolecular structures is regulated by motor proteins, cytoskeletal elements, and a wide variety of chemical messengers. pigment cells are an excellent model in which to study cell motility because pigment granules are readily visible, move rapidly, and undergo reversible movements which can be manipulated experimentally  <cit> . found in a variety of cell types, pigment granule motility in the retinal pigment epithelium  was examined in the present study.

the rpe is a single layer of cells found between the neural retina and the choroid. in animals that do not possess the ability to constrict the pupil, rpe cells possess apical processes which interdigitate with photoreceptors  <cit> . within each cell, pigment granules aggregate and disperse. in the aggregated state, pigment granules are withdrawn from the apical processes and cluster in the cell body , while in the dispersed state, they are moved down the lengths of apical processes as shown in figure 1c–d. in the dispersed state, protection of rod photoreceptors from photobleaching is thought to be enhanced  <cit> .

extracellular molecular mediators stimulate pigment granule motility, and several different agents have been identified that induce movement. forskolin  stimulates adenylyl cyclase to increase intracellular levels of camp, resulting in aggregation  <cit> . catecholamines and their agonists  induce dispersion  <cit> . dopamine acts through d <dig> receptors which inhibit adenylyl cyclase  <cit> . with adenylyl cyclase inhibited, i decreases and dispersion ensues.

catecholamines are not the only extracellular messengers that induce pigment granule dispersion in rpe. in  <dig>  garcía  <cit>  reported that the acetylcholine analog carbachol induces pigment granule dispersion in rpe isolated from green sunfish . gonzález et al.  <cit>  extended this finding to rpe isolated from bluegill  and further reported that muscarinic modd receptor activation leads to pigment granule motility. later it was found that the native ligand acetylcholine induces pigment granule dispersion  <cit> . following modd receptor activation, phospholipase c is activated, cleaving pip <dig> to generate diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate . antagonists to the ip <dig> receptor inhibited carbachol-induced dispersion  <cit> .

in other systems, the ip <dig> receptor has been found within the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. with ligand bound to the ip <dig> receptor, ca2+ stored within the er lumen is released into the cytosol . extrapolating these observations to regulation of pigment granule movement in rpe, one might infer a role for ca2+ in regulating pigment granule dispersion in rpe. however, king-smith et al.  <cit>  were unable to demonstrate a role for ca2+ in either pigment granule dispersion or aggregation. rather, they found that when dispersion is experimentally induced by camp washout in rpe isolated from green sunfish , there is no significant rise in intracellular ca2+ levels nor does chelating ca2+ prevent pigment granule dispersion. this finding may not, however, rule out a role for ca2+ in a physiological setting involving receptor activation if the physiological role for ca2+ precedes a decrease in intracellular . therefore, the hypothesis driving our study was that ca2+ is required for carbachol-induced dispersion in rpe cells isolated from bluegill, which we examined using calcium chelators, calcium channel blockers and calcium-free media. furthermore, we predicted that if calcium were required, calcium-dependent effectors would also be expected to play a role in pigment granule dispersion; therefore, intracellular mediators involved in pigment granule dispersion were explored.

RESULTS
exploration for calcium requirements in carbachol-induced pigment granule dispersion
to test whether an elevation in intracellular ca2+ was required for carbachol-induced pigment granule dispersion, rpe cells were isolated, treated with forskolin  and then challenged to disperse in the presence or absence of the membrane-permeant ca2+ chelator bapta-am. when cells were incubated with  <dig> nm carbachol in the presence of  <dig> μm bapta-am or  <dig> μm bapta-am, the resulting pigment index  values  were not statistically significantly different from the pi of cells treated with fsk  but were different from pi of cells treated with carbachol alone  . the maximum concentration of dmso used during incubation  did not alter pi values in controls .

to test the importance of extracellular ca2+ in carbachol-induced pigment granule dispersion, verapamil, an l-type ca2+ channel antagonist, was tested for its ability to block carbachol-induced dispersion. verapamil failed to block carbachol-induced dispersion at both  <dig> μm  and  <dig> μm  concentrations. the difference in pi between cells with and without the ca2+ channel blocker was not statistically significant . in addition, the differences between the pigment indices for either condition  and the fsk condition were statistically significant.

to confirm that an influx of ca2+ from the extracellular medium was not required, rpe cells were isolated, treated with forskolin  and then challenged to disperse in the presence or absence of extracellular ca2+. rpe were treated with  <dig> μm fsk to induce pigment granule aggregation followed by carbachol  to induce pigment granules to disperse. the difference in pi between cells with  and without  extracellular ca2+ available was not statistically significant . however, the difference between either condition  and the  <dig> μm fsk condition was statistically significantly different.

investigation of calcium-dependent mediator proteins
since our results using bapta-am suggested a role for intracellular ca2+, we tested possible downstream, ca2+-dependent mediators. we first tested whether protein kinase c  is required for carbachol-induced dispersion by using two inhibitors . cells treated with carbachol in the absence or presence of staurosporine  were found to differ from the cells treated with fsk, but were not different from each other . when bisindolylmaleimide ii  was applied with carbachol, dispersion was partially inhibited, but only in the  <dig> nm treatment . exhibiting a 20% inhibition in dispersion, the cells treated with  <dig> nm bisindolylmaleimide ii were statistically significantly different from both fsk and carbachol treatments.

to test whether activating pkc was sufficient to induce dispersion, pma was applied to rpe. following fsk treatment, pma  elicited pi values  that were not significantly different from fsk-treated cells .

another ca2+-dependent effector tested was the protein phosphatase calcineurin. the calcineurin inhibitor cypermethrin  completely inhibited carbachol-induced pigment granule dispersion . the cypermethrin condition  was not significantly different from the fsk condition , but was different from the carbachol condition .

discussion
the results indicate that an elevation of intracellular ca2+ is required for carbachol-induced pigment granule dispersion. furthermore, the necessary ca2+ may be derived entirely from intracellular stores, and one effector activated by ca2+ is the protein phosphatase calcineurin. in contrast, our results using inhibitors and activators of pkc suggest that the activity of this enzyme is neither necessary for carbachol-induced pigment granule dispersion nor sufficient to drive pigment granule dispersion.

carbachol-mediated dispersion requires activation of the ip <dig> receptor  <cit> , suggesting that intracellular ca2+ stores are accessed following muscarinic receptor activation  <cit> . chelating intracellular ca2+ with bapta completely blocks carbachol-induced dispersion. that this ca2+ is most likely coming from intracellular stores  and not from the extracellular environment is supported by the observations that carbachol-induced dispersion is blocked by the ip <dig> receptor antagonist 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate  <cit>  and eliminating extracellular ca2+ or blocking its entry across the plasma membrane failed to inhibit dispersion. there are many ca2+-requiring mediators that could be involved in carbachol-induced dispersion, including the ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin. since cypermethrin inhibits calcineurin activity, finding that cypermethrin blocks carbachol-induced pigment granule dispersion suggests that calcineurin is involved. this result correlates with work done by thaler and haimo  <cit> . studying melanophores, they found a role for calcineurin in pigment aggregation. furthermore, garcía  <cit>  found that okadaic acid induces aggregation in rpe cells of green sunfish, suggesting a role for protein phosphatases in maintaining pigment granule dispersion.

one possible role for calcineurin is to remove phosphate groups added to proteins by pka  <cit> . when fsk is applied to cells, camp levels increase  <cit> , leading to pka activation  <cit>  and eventual aggregation of pigment granules. in the rpe pigment motility system, the substrate phosphorylated by pka is as yet unknown. prior to dispersion, camp levels drop and likewise pka activity. increased ca2+ concentrations inside the cell may lead to calcineurin activation that may remove phosphate groups from substrates of pka, enabling pigment granule dispersion to occur. our finding that cypermethrin inhibits carbachol-induced dispersion is consistent with this model.

as stated before, inhibition of plc blocks carbachol-induced dispersion  <cit> . since plc cleaves pip <dig> into ip <dig>  and dag, and dag and ca2+ together activate protein kinase c, protein kinase c seemed likely to be a mediator of carbachol-induced dispersion  <cit> . this hypothesis seemed the more likely since in some species, pigment dispersion in melanophores appears to be regulated by pkc  <cit> . however, our results from three separate experiments failed to support a role for pkc in carbachol-induced dispersion. treatment with the pkc activator pma did not induce pigment granule dispersion. neither of the pkc inhibitors tested  inhibited carbachol-induced pigment granule dispersion at most concentrations tested. cells treated with bisindolylmaleimide ii at  <dig> nm experienced a 20% inhibition in dispersion relative to the carbachol-treated cells when data from the latter were compiled from all experiments. however, when comparison was made only to the carbachol-treated cells from the experiment in which the  <dig> nm concentration was tested, the difference in mean pigment indices was not found to be statistically significant. this case was the only one in which the compilation of the data yielded a statistical outcome different from analysis of the data within single experiments. nevertheless, it remains possible that pkc has a role in carbachol-mediated dispersion which parallels the main pathway linking receptor activation to pigment granule movement. it should be mentioned that definitive evidence that pkc is expressed in bluegill rpe has yet to be found. we have found that pkc-α and pkc-β were expressed in bluegill brain, but not in bluegill rpe . these findings are consistent with work reported by others. in the retina of zebrafish, pkc labelling is observed in the neural retina, but not in the retinal pigment epithelium  <cit> .

although much remains to be discovered, our results have increased our understanding of the pathway from carbachol to pigment granule dispersion. we propose the following model: first, carbachol binds an modd muscarinic receptor leading to plc activation  <cit> . plc then cleaves pip <dig> into dag and ip <dig>  a role for dag in pigment movement in rpe has not been revealed. in contrast, ip <dig> binds its receptor, thus releasing ca2+ from intracellular stores  <cit> . although the conclusion requires support from ca2+ imaging, our data indicates that ca2+ released from such stores is sufficient for downstream mediator activation; in other words, extracellular ca2+ is not required. increasing cytosolic ca2+ leads to calcineurin activation. calcineurin removes phosphate groups added by pka on an as yet unidentified protein which functions as a molecular switch regulating the pigment granule position in the retinal pigment epithelium. refer to figure  <dig> for the proposed carbachol-induced dispersion pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicated that in the rpe of bluegill, carbachol-induced pigment granule dispersion is a process that requires intracellular, but not extracellular, ca2+. our evidence also supports a pigment dispersion model that requires calcineurin but not protein kinase c.
