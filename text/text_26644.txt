BACKGROUND
preeclampsia  is a severe disorder of human pregnancies affecting up to  <dig> % of primiparous women in industrialized countries. this hypertensive disease develops from the second half of pregnancy and is associated with proteinuria, and sometimes with oedemas. the causes of preeclampsia are complex and multiple, with a combination of environmental and genetic effects from maternal  <cit>  as well as paternal origin  <cit> . at the histological level, preeclampsia is characterized by a shallow colonization of the maternal endometrium  by the invasive cytotrophoblasts. in a normal gestation, this process occurs during the second trophoblastic colonization wave around the end of the first trimester of gestation allowing the invasive cytotrophoblasts to reach the placental bed. in this case, the arterial wall is infiltrated by endovascular trophoblasts, triggering a suppression of the vasomotor control, thus resulting in a very important dilatation of the lumen and a loss of the elastic properties of the arteries  <cit> . by contrast, when the invasion is defective, remaining too shallow  <cit> , fibrinous material accumulates in the arteries, myocytes proliferate. this may lead to local thrombosis and is therefore supposed to impact on the local oxygen pressure leading to placental ischemia/hypoxia, and ultimately to functional anomalies of the maternal vascular endothelium  <cit> . finally, the functions of the syncytiotrophoblast, the specific tissue resulting from the fusion of the cytotrophoblasts, may be modified, leading to trophoblast apoptosis. links between placental pathology and hypoxia are now clearly documented . intra-uterine growth retardation  constitutes another group of complex diseases, a large subset of which is associated with placental malfunction, and often with preeclampsia, although this is not at all systematic. iugr may be defined as a rupture in the normal growth curve of the foetus, although it is generally defined as a birth weight inferior to the 10th or to the 3rd percentile  of the smallest babies. this simple definition does not take into account the dynamics of the growth curve, but is very easily workable. this explains at least partly the underlying complexity present under the term iugr. at least, two very distinct situations are possible: iugr may be the result of endogenous developmental and growth factors affecting the fetus growth; or, alternatively, a placental defect may inhibit the transfer of nutriments and oxygen from the mother to the fetus . in the following, vascular iugr correspond to those exhibiting an abnormal doppler. in this latter case, the iugr may be caused by a vascular pathology such as pe. consequently, there is a clear need for classification of iugr, and for improving the understanding of its etiology, both issues possibly based upon the characterization of specific marker genes.

in addition, it is now well documented that babies presenting with a small birth weight are at increased risk for developing systemic pathologies at adulthood, such as diabetes or cardiovascular troubles  <cit> . one clear limitation of the therapeutic possibilities for pe and iugr resides in the fact that whilst many indications suggest that their causes are very precocious during placental development  <cit> , their symptoms occur late, at least from mid-gestation, and more often from the last trimester of the pregnancy. evaluating the risk early would allow orienting the medical choices towards a better follow-up of the pregnancy, or even towards some pharmacological options, such as the chronic use of mild doses of aspirin.

in order to explore on a wide basis the links between hypoxia and placental diseases, and to identify early putative markers of the preeclamptic pathology, we combined the subtractive/suppressive hybridization  methodology starting with cdna material obtained from first trimester placental purified villi with the construction of high-density nylon macroarrays . a first characterization of the libraries has previously been performed by systematic sequencing, enabling to identify all the genes that were modulated by short-term hypoxia in early placental villi, even when this genes are expressed at a low level  <cit> . however, this systematic sequencing approach does not indicate which gene could constitute an optimal early marker for disease detection . therefore, in the present study, we used the less sensitive approach of hybridization in order to identify genes modulated early by hypoxia in pregnancy , and also highly expressed and modified in placental diseases occurring later. we report here on the macroarray hybridization results obtained from  <dig> different sources of cdna. we demonstrate a clear association between pe and the early hypoxic induction of a series of genes involved in different metabolic processes. this association was totally absent when cdnas from isolated iugr were used as probes. we could also demonstrate that the kinetics of hypoxia is not linear, and that genes transcriptionnally modulated in early placentas after  <dig> h of hypoxia may return to their basal expression level when the culture is maintained for  <dig> h in hypoxic conditions. finally, we demonstrate that genes highly expressed in the placenta are clustered in specific chromosome regions, in particular in regions previously defined as containing imprinted genes, such as 11p <dig> .

RESULTS
 <dig>  overview of the genes highly expressed in placental physiology according to their putative interactions
when all the hybridizations were considered,  <dig> clones out of  <dig> yielded a response above the background level of the membrane after an overnight autoradiography. hybridization with a labeled oligo dt indicated that  <dig> clones corresponded to oligo dt sequences cloned during the ssh procedure. these clones were generally highly labeled in most hybridization experiments, except when the probe was prepared from a placenta where the apparent level of transcriptional activity was dramatically decreased . finally,  <dig> sequences corresponded to known genes of which  <dig> were different . the normalization effect of the ssh was demonstrated by the fact that  <dig> genes were found only once. the most frequent was cga , found in  <dig> occurrences. the other frequently represented genes corresponded to mitochondrial genes involved in the structure of the mitochondrial ribosome  or in the respiratory chain . the complete set of genes could be divided in  <dig> distinct cell functions: rna binding, protein synthesis, apoptosis, inflammation, cell to cell contacts, angiogenesis, epigenetic mechanisms and imprinting, cytoskeleton constitution, signal transduction, cell cycle and lipid metabolism. these functions and the links existing between  <dig> genes are represented in figure  <dig>  drawn from literature information. genes induced by hypoxia are written in red and genes inhibited by hypoxia in blue. amongst several noticeable features, the picture exhibits a large amount of genes encoding rna-interacting factors. several of these genes encode proteins recognizing specific mrnas. this is the case for nufip <dig> that interacts specifically with eef1a <dig> mrna, this latter encoding a specific elongation factor interacting with ribosomal proteins for elongating nascent polypetidic chain. similarly, igfii  mrna binding protein- <dig> , interacts in particular with igfii mrna  <cit> , a well known very important actor of placental growth and physiology, as demonstrated recently by the specific invalidation of the igfii placental isoform  <cit> . the importance of imp <dig> was recently emphasized in a study demonstrating by rna interference its involvement for enhancing igfii mrna translation in k <dig> leukemia cells  <cit> . rna interacting factors represent less than 1% of the total gene content in mammals. in our subset of highly expressed placental genes, they represent over 4% of the total.

 <dig>  hierarchical clustering of genes and hybridization experiments
to take into account the complexity of the tissue, the hybridization experiments were grouped into six categories from the cdna prepared from samples listed in table  <dig>  the signals from the different experiments were averaged, as described in experimental procedures. the clustering tool developed by eisen and coworkers  <cit>  was applied to the set of  <dig> identified genes. two hundred and seventy five genes could be grouped in seven clusters of similar expression . the experiments were classified by the program in the following organization: normal placenta, either term or early were grouped into one cluster while placenta from disease states or from villi maintained in hypoxia during  <dig> h were grouped in another cluster. in a lower order cluster, pe and per were grouped and associated with early villi maintained during  <dig> h in hypoxia while isolated iugr was placed separately. the distribution of genes into two sets  made it possible to assess statistically the possible relationships between the effects on the transcript levels of a relatively short period of hypoxia  on early placenta  and pathological states developing later . genes that are specific of the placenta, either early or at term, have a slight trend to be specifically induced by hypoxia in early term placenta. there is also a highly significant tendency of preeclamptic villi, either from isolated pe or pe combined with iugr, to express genes induced by  <dig> h hypoxia in early placental villi. the inverted trend is observed at a highly significant level in hybridizations carried out with probes obtained from early term villi maintained in hypoxia during  <dig> h with an excess of "normoxic" genes found in this situation. we supposed that this observation could be related to a specific kinetics of induction by oxygen concentration, where short exposure to hypoxia may have effects that are at the opposite of long-term hypoxia. indeed, we could observe that genes whose expression was modified by short periods of hypoxia may later return to their basal expression level as shown by analyzing kinetics of expression in hybridizations with cdna of the same placenta maintained in hypoxia during  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> hours . in the cases of isolated vascular iugr, due to a drastic limitation of the materno-foetal blood flow only  <dig> positive clones yielded a detectable signal . these positive clones corresponded to mitochondrial genes, igfii and psg <dig>  psg <dig>  and psg <dig> , indicating that these genes constitute a minimal survival set to sustain gestation. moreover, the signal level of positive clones was quite comparable with that of other experiments, demonstrating that the relevant rna species are indeed present at a high level. since transcriptional activity is very reduced in vascular iugr , this suggests that some mrna molecules are specifically protected from degradation in the very harsh pathological condition of vascular iugr.

 <dig>  identification of factors specific of the pathological status of the placenta
 <dig>  promoter structure of pe/hypoxia induced genes
sequences spanning from  <dig> bp of dna 5' of the transcription start site and extending  <dig> bp after, were recovered from genbank at the ncbi and were analysed for their composition in cpg islands and the presence or absence of hypoxia inducible factor  <dig> α  binding sites. hif is a transcription factor protected from degradation in many cell system under hypoxic conditions. it plays an essential role in modulating responses to hypoxia by inducing or inhibiting multiple genes. four possible binding sites have been described for this factor, acgtgc, acgtgg, gcgtgc and gcgtgg  <cit> .

the promoters could be classified into four categories: several of them, such as the promoters of psg <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  cul <dig>  or cga, do not contain any noticeable cpg islands. several others contain a concentration of cpg islands very close to, or encompassing the transcription start site . other promoters contain cpg islands at around  <dig> bp 5' upstream of the atg . finally, some promoters are highly enriched in cpg islands over the whole  <dig> bp examined . the set of promoters with the cpg density and the position of putative hif binding sites are supplied as supplemental data file  <dig>  we could also classify these promoters according to the maximal density of cpg achieved in the  <dig> kb window analysed in five groups . consistently with the high gc-richness of putative hif binding site, there was a clear linear relationship between the cpg density and the number of putative hif binding sites . the distribution of these sites was analysed inside the promoters by sharing these promoters into two halves of equal length and counting the putative sites inside each subsequence. a student t-test did not reveal any preference towards one side against the other .

 <dig>  non-random chromosome distribution of placental genes in eutherian mammals
the analysis of the cytogenetic location available from our database revealed that several genes expressed at a detectable level in hybridization experiments were clustered to specific chromosomal regions. we focused our interest on the precise chromosome location of these genes, using the information available at the ncbi site  <cit>  in order to obtain their precise physical position expressed in megabases.

we could confirm by statistical analysis  that the distribution of the subset of highly expressed placental genes was not random. on the contrary, we identified  <dig> clusters on  <dig> different chromosome regions: 1p <dig> , 6q <dig> , 11p <dig> , 11q <dig> , 12q <dig> , 19q <dig> , 20q <dig>  and xq <dig>  . among these regions,  <dig> are known to contain imprinted genes . these four regions are conserved in synteny and colinearity in mice, while the regions corresponding to human 11q <dig> and 12q <dig> are separated on different mice chromosomes. despite the more limited mapping information available in pigs, obtained at the iccare website  <cit>  and cattle  <cit> , we did not detect any chromosome breakpoints in these species for these specific chromosome regions.

discussion
in this study we designed a new transcriptome resource directed at evaluating the effects of hypoxia on human placenta. this tool is particularly original if compared to the existing commercial membranes, since the distribution of clones into two subgroups makes it possible to analyze statistically whether one condition is connected to hypoxia-induced stimulation or inhibition of gene expression. this was clearly shown for pe, a pathologic condition that correlated very well with the induction of "hypoxic" genes. since the placenta is one of the organs presenting the greatest abundance of diversified transcripts, these membranes can also be useful for characterizing either other biological systems, or the effects of hypoxia on other tissues. the use of the ssh approach to construct the membranes may also generate some biases as the cloning is dependent on the existence of rsa <dig> restriction sites in the starting material . nevertheless, our tool, focused on early hypoxia, is a useful complement to other dna arrays experiments, based on commercial membranes  <cit> . as shown in our study, this tool was used to analyze at the mrna level the consequences of the two most frequent placental pathologies, preeclampsia and intra-uterine growth retardation.

some of the genes found associated with pe in the present study had already been evaluated as putative markers of placental pathological status, such as human chorionic gonadotrophin  and human placental lactogen , as well as pregnancy specific glycoproteins . a significant serum increase in hcg was found more prevalent in preeclamptic women  <cit> . in another recent study, hpl and psgs were found reduced at  <dig> weeks in the serum of patients who develop later a preeclamptic condition, albeit serum levels are restored later  <cit> . hcg is composed of two polypeptidic chains, α and β, encoded by cga  and cgb, respectively. it is known to play important roles in placental physiology  <cit> . in our study cga was indeed found induced in several pe cases, but could not be associated with a specific differential oxygen status. cgb was present in the membranes, but was not specifically induced in preeclampsia. the only cgb clone was located in plate 7h <dig> . the over-expression of cga could lead to an overall increase of hcg in the patient serum however the mechanisms involved for regulating the expression of the two polypeptidic chains constitutive of hcg seem to display opposite modes of regulation.

recently, bersinger and odegard  <cit>  have demonstrated that in iugr, hpl is continuously lowered later in pregnancy. this is consistent with our results, as we could not detect any trace of expression of this gene in the iugr probes that were hybridized on the membranes. similarly, the expression level was low in control term placentas . however, hpl appeared strongly induced in pe, especially in severe cases. these results at the mrna level differ from the findings of bersinger and odegard  <cit>  concerning the hpl protein levels, which were going back to normal at weeks  <dig> and  <dig> of preeclampsia. possibly, the accumulation of hpl mrna would not be followed by translation in pe.

only three psg were found in the membranes amongst the  <dig> existing genes. psgs are supposed to play an essential immunomodulatory effect in pregnancy  <cit> . consistently with our result, in a recent microarray study  <cit>  the authors used a commercial membrane to identify differentially expressed genes in preeclamptic and normal placentas. among the ten most highly expressed genes in the membranes, the authors have identified psg <dig>  psg <dig> and psg <dig>  interestingly, those are exactly the highly expressed genes that we have found in term placentas suggesting that only these psgs are specifically expressed at a high level in term pregnancies. this observation raises the question of the regulation of the entire cluster of psg genes which spans roughly  <dig> kilobases on 19q <dig> in the order  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . to address the question of psg regulation, we performed a clustal alignment of  <dig> kilobases upstream of the first codons of psg  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the clustering of the promoters indicated a very high level of conservation and was not able to group psg <dig>  psg <dig> and psg <dig> as more similar together . this indicates that the specifically high expression level of  <dig> genes, which are not contiguous, depends on specific long-range acting chromatin factors.

angptl <dig>  also called fiaf  is another  <dig> h hypoxia-activated gene recurrently found in pe cases. it is a downstream target of pparγ , and is therefore supposed to regulate lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis  <cit> . although belonging to a family of  <dig> genes, it is the only one that we could detect by hybridization, suggesting a highly specific mode of regulation, consistently with what has been described of its specific regulation compared to angptl <dig>  <cit> . in mice, angptl4/fiaf is increased in the plasma by fasting and decreased by high fat diet  <cit> , demonstrating its involvement in lipid capture in difficult physiological conditions, of which pe may represent a paradigmatic case.

another unexpected actor of the onset of pe could be h <dig>  this rna-encoding gene is of ill-defined function. it is located in the 11p <dig>  cluster of imprinted genes and expressed by the maternal allele, in apparent opposition with igfii. both genes appear regulated by a common dmr , and have opposite effects on fetal growth in mice  <cit> . both igfii and h <dig> were found in the set of hypoxia-induced genes, consistently with the existence of hif1α binding sites in their promoters suggesting the ability to respond almost instantaneously to variations in oxygen concentration. for igfii, this is also consistent with its described although controversed angiogenic properties  <cit> . however, while igfii was not pe-specific  as well as in early placentas exposed to hypoxia), h <dig> was specifically expressed in pe and strongly in severe pe.

in our study, we could observe that true vascular iugr results in a drastic reduction of the transcriptional activity of the placenta. in these cases, only mrnas for igfii, psg <dig>  psg <dig> and psg <dig>  and mitochondrial genes were present, and no polya could be detected. therefore, we could conclude that in vascular iugr, only a minimal set of genes was transcriptionnally maintained in the placental tissue in order to prevent spontaneous abortion,  transcripts from genes of the respiratory cascade,  igfii, one isoform of which is the essential growth factor in placenta  <cit> , and  three genes of the psg cluster. the absence of polya in the cdnas from purely vascular iugr suggests that the remaining clones are maintained by stabilization of the transcripts rather than at the transcriptional level. this may be substantiated by the observation of imp3cdna in the transcripts specifically expressed in less severe cases of iugr. imp <dig> encodes a factor interacting with the igfii mrna, possibly stabilizing the transcript, and belonging to an imprinted region on chromosome  <dig> 

in non-purely vascular iugr, fth <dig>  was expressed at a high level, suggesting the existence of genetic adaptative mechanism to a restricted supply of nutrients. however, ferritin was found twice in the library, without correlation with the oxygen status, showing that this gene does not participate directly in the rapid response to low oxygen concentrations. ferritin is a major factor for ensuring a sufficient iron store to the neonate at birth. this echoes to a study showing that children presenting a low iron store at birth had low serum ferritin concentrations at  <dig> months  <cit> , suggesting a risk of iron deficiency in the second postnatal year.

interestingly, in both pathologies, we found the induction of fem1-c. this gene, discovered as a homologous of a caeborhabditis elegans gene contains kh domains, themselves highly present inside fgif, the principal inducer of the foetal globin. again, its presence in the library was not correlated with short hypoxia . however, we observed that its mrna concentration was lowered at  <dig> h hypoxia. its occurrence in pathological situations could refer to a specific adaptative mechanism aiming at increasing the oxygen capture for the foetus. its induction fits well with the observed increase in ferritin mrna, both genes fem1-c and fth <dig>  aiming at building the proteic and prosthetic part of the globin polypeptide, respectively.

some particularly appealing genes for the diseases studied were present in the membranes but were not revealed by hybridization with specific pathologic samples, as they appear down-regulated in pathological conditions. among those, we found two clones corresponding to serpine <dig> and one to serping <dig>  these two genes are inhibitors of serine-proteases that may play a role in thrombus clearance, and therefore are necessary for adequate circulatory functions. serping <dig>  is particularly interesting, since several mutations of this gene are involved in the development of hereditary angioedema . oedemas frequently accompanies the preeclamptic condition, therefore specific malfunctions of serpine <dig> and serping <dig> could represent risk factors for placental diseases. serpine <dig> also appeared in our previous study  <cit>  as a gene present in the hypoxic library at the highest number of occurrences. therefore, it suggests that a gene induced by short-term hypoxia, may be on the contrary down-regulated by chronic hypoxia, such as observed in pe. recently, we have shown that the same type of regulation is also true for serping <dig> .

we performed a systematic analysis of the 5' regions of the pe and iugr induced genes. in many of them, we found cpg islands that may be modulators of gene expression. in a future work we shall analyze several of these regions by bisulphite analysis of cpg methylation in normal and pathological cases, to try to give a molecular basis to the observed differences in gene expression. in most cases, we discovered more than one hif binding site in the various promoters identified. experimental verification will be needed to evaluate the significance of these binding sites.

a surprising result in our study was the demonstration that genes expressed at a level sufficiently high to be detectable in one at least of our hybridization experiments, are mapped to specific chromosome regions. this is particularly the case for clusters of imprinted genes. in these respects, the involvement of the 11p <dig>  cluster in the physiopathology of pe fits well with the recent observation that the invalidation of p57/kip <dig>  another gene of this cluster results in "preeclampsia-like" symptoms in mice  <cit> .

in recent studies, several groups have demonstrated that the human genome is organized in large clusters of highly expressed genes  <cit> . this high level organization of the human genome is conserved in other mammalian species, such as cattle and pigs  <cit> . in the present study, we demonstrate that beside expression level, clustering also exists for functional purposes, such as placental physiology. this vision of the mammalian genome is consistent with the hypotheses and experimental demonstrations developed by cremer and co-workers, indicating that the presence of entire chromosomes or chromosome regions inside sub-compartments of the nucleoplasm triggers variations in expression levels  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study has:

• demonstrated highly significant differences between isolated iugr and pe concerning the effects of placental oxygen pressure on gene expression. this finding suggests that very different mechanisms are involved when iugr originates from a fetus-borne developmental dysfunction, and when iugr results from a vascular defect such as pe.

• provided the scientific community with a directly available tool, making the link between hypoxia and placental diseases

• confirmed the importance of several risk factors for pe and iugr 

• suggested new possible targets for diagnosing early these pathologies, and possibly for alleviating their effects . since the ssh was carried out from an early placenta, our study makes the link between potential markers of early oxygen depletion, and the late development of preeclamptic lesions, strengthening the idea that pe may be caused by early alterations of placental function.

• demonstrated the existence of a genomic organization of placental function in placental mammals.

this work opens the way to characterize at the molecular level the physio-pathological mechanisms of very complex situations that often perturb normal pregnancies.
