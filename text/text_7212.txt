BACKGROUND
bacterial species typically contain large amounts of genetic variation in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms , which originate by mutation and have dynamics that depend on the balance between natural selection and genetic drift  <cit> . there is some debate on whether or not most of these polymorphisms are selectively neutral at the molecular level  <cit> . species have been genetically defined through the analysis of dna variation using comparative techniques such as hybridization, the sequencing of gene markers, and  complete genome sequences  <cit> . it has been proposed that similarity values greater than 70% obtained in dna-dna hybridization experiments are sufficient to define a coherent group of organisms as belonging to the same species  <cit> . these estimates are very rough, subject to experimental variation, and they only indirectly measure similarity   <cit> . a comparative analysis of complete genomes minimizes most of these limitations. several measures of genomic relatedness, such as the average nucleotide identity  and the maximal unique matches  have been proposed for such analyses  <cit> . both ani and mum are based on pairwise nucleotide comparisons of complete genomes, and several reports have shown good correlations between the results from these analyses and other measures of genetic relatedness, such as those based on multilocus sequencing typing , 16s sequencing, and gene content  <cit> . however, these comparative methods rely on the availability of complete genome sequences and are affected by the quality of the dna sequencing data, which in the case of draft genomes might not be optimal  <cit> . the latter issue has not been thoroughly addressed in past studies. one exception was the comparisons made by richter and roselló-mora  <cit> , who suggested that low genome sequence coverage can be sufficient for inferring dna similarity values comparable to ani obtained with complete genomes.

bacterial species have mechanisms for gene exchange , and genetic recombination is believed to play a prominent role in diversifying species by distributing variation and generating new allele combinations  <cit> . horizontal gene transfer is an important source of genomic variation within and between species  <cit> , and homologous recombination frequently results in the exchange of small genomic regions between members of the same or closely related species  <cit> . the estimated rates of homologous recombination vary widely among bacteria; in some instances, recombination seems to have contributed to species diversification to a greater extent than even point mutations, whereas in other species homologous recombination appears to be rare  <cit> .

recombination has typically been assessed by molecular techniques such as multilocus enzyme electrophoresis , amplified fragment length polymorphism , or multi locus sequence typing mlst  <cit> . these methods primarily measure linkage disequilibrium , and are based on the degree of allele association at different housekeeping loci. for example, e. coli strains show strong ld, reflecting infrequent genetic mixing within local populations  <cit> . more recently, the availability of complete genomic sequences has allowed recombination to be assessed more accurately  <cit> . interestingly, genomic sequencing combined with analyses of population genetics have shown that the recombination rates within e. coli are higher than the mutation rates, but not to the extent that the phylogenetic signal is distorted  <cit> . despite frequent recombination between strains, therefore, the genes seem to coexist in an organized genome, resulting in a chromosomal plasticity that accelerates the adaptation of e. coli to various environments.

in this work, we studied the intraspecific variability and recombination in rhizobium etli, a soil bacterium that associates with bean roots to fix nitrogen. previous studies have noted that this species has a variable gene content and high genomic divergence  <cit> , as well as a low rate of recombination  among isolates from the same geographical site  <cit> . however, in isolates  of sinorhizobium medicae, it was found that frequency of recombination was higher in plasmids and megaplasmids, as compared to the chromosome  <cit> . the first purpose of this work was to perform a detailed genomic analysis of the nucleotide variation in this species. accordingly, we used stringent methods to identify snps from a set of complete and draft genomes of r. etli, assessed the value of draft genomes and low coverage data when seeking to obtain global measures of genetic relatedness, and then examined the nucleotide differences among various strains of r. etli. the second purpose was to assess the role of recombination in generating genomic diversity in r. etli. our results confirm and extend the previous estimations on the genomic diversity of r. etli, and indicate that recombination might play only a minor role in generating such diversity. therefore, we conclude that the species r. etli is composed of separate genomic lineages that share a low rate of recombination but have a common symbiotic phenotype.

RESULTS
nucleotide variation assessment in complete and draft genomes
since accurate snp identification relies largely on the quality of the sequence data, the use of draft genome sequences could potentially introduce errors into the variation estimates. therefore, stringent parameters  were used to identify high-quality snps in a set of two complete r. etli genomes, cfn <dig> and ciat <dig>  isolated from méxico and costa rica respectively, and six draft genome sequences from strains isolated in different places of the world: brasil <dig> , ciat <dig> , gr <dig>  ie <dig> , kim <dig> , and 8c- <dig> and gr <dig>   <cit> . all the sanger reads were collected from the draft genomes  were aligned against the predicted orfs of the cfn <dig> or ciat <dig> genomes, and the alignments were evaluated using polybayes , which determined the probability that a nucleotide site was polymorphic, based on the phred quality of the read. a phred value of q <dig> and a probability greater than  <dig>  are generally considered acceptable for the detection of snps  <cit> . most of the snps in our data set had probability scores >  <dig> , indicating that more than  <dig>  snps per genome had phred qualities over q <dig> . to avoid the possible inclusion of false positives , we used only snps with a minimum phred score of q <dig> and the highest bayesian probabilities  throughout this work  <cit> .

additional errors in snp determination might arise from poorly aligned regions. since r. etli genomes have a high proportion of paralogous sequences  <cit> , a stringent identification of orthologous segments of genes was performed. we aligned the contigs of each draft genome sequence against the orfs from the complete genomes of either cfn <dig> or ciat <dig>  using both ungapped and gapped alignments, along with the reciprocal best hit criteria. we considered dna gene segments as being orthologous to the reference sequence if they had nucleotide identities higher than 85% and coverage higher than 60% of the reference gene. various numbers of orthologous segments were identified from the draft genomes, covering about 40% of the total gene contents of the reference strains. the total amount of data collected by this procedure is about  <dig> to  <dig>  mb per draft genome .

to determine the robustness of the above-described procedure, we simulated a draft assembly by using sanger read samples of the complete genomes of different e. coli strains at low coverage  . the contigs of the simulated assembly were aligned with the genome of e. coli k <dig>  and snps were detected as described above. on average, the obtained nucleotide variation ranged from about 1% to 2%  . there was no significant difference ) when we compared the results obtained at 1× coverage versus those obtained with the complete genome assembled at about 10× coverage, indicating that 1× coverage of the genome sequence could be considered a robust proxy of full variation at the genomic level in this species.

snp frequencies among the r. etli strains
we quantified the snps in r. etli by computing the pairwise nucleotide differences between individual draft genomes versus the complete genomes of strains cfn <dig> or ciat <dig>  more snps were found in comparisons made versus the cfn <dig> genome  than the ciat <dig> genome . for example, the brasil <dig> strain had a median of 5% snps per aligned fragment when compared with cfn <dig> but only 2% compared to ciat <dig>  indicating that brasil <dig> is more closely related to ciat <dig> than cfn <dig>  similarly, variance was higher when brasil <dig> was compared with cfn <dig> rather than ciat <dig> . a very similar pattern was found for strain 8c- <dig>  the other strains showed similar levels of variation, on the order of 6%  and 4% , with the latter comparison always showing a lower variance. comparison between the complete genomes of cfn <dig> and ciat <dig>  result in a median variation of 9%, that is high but still lower than the comparisons between cfn <dig> and r. leguminosarum bv viciae  <dig> . moreover, when we compared r. leguminosarum bv. viciae  <dig> with all of the r. etli strains  , the greatest difference in snp percentage  was seen in the comparison with strain cfn <dig> .

average nucleotide variation
we sought to obtain a single measure of the nucleotide variation across the whole set of genomes. to this end, we averaged the medians of the snp distributions for each alignment  and generated average confidence interval  using predictive analytics software pasw statistics  <dig> . this statistical test of proportions compares the observed proportions of an event  in k samples , uses a chi-squared test to seek significant differences among the proportions, and subsequently adjusts the confidence intervals for each sample. the generated measure, herein called the average nucleotide variation , might represent the species-level variation. we obtained anv values of 4% and 6% when we compared all the analyzed strains against ciat <dig> and cfn <dig>  respectively . although the largest numbers of snps were found in comparisons with the cfn <dig> genome, all strains were similarly divergent according to the 95% confidence intervals with respect to the median . this observation indicates that cfn <dig> is almost equally divergent with respect to all other strains. comparisons with the ciat <dig> genome showed that strains brasil <dig> and 8c- <dig> were closer to this strain than to cfn <dig>  moreover, the ciat <dig> strain yielded the highest number of snps, causing its average snp proportion to fall outside the average confidence interval . strains ciat <dig> and ie <dig> showed greater divergences than the rest of the strains, regardless of the reference strain  used in the comparison.

nucleotide variation profiles in homologous genomic segments from different r. etli strains
to explore how snps are distributed in the r. etli genomes, we first identified orthologous segments for which we had sequence information in all eight studied strains . a total of  <dig> segments with a median size of  <dig> bp were common to all strains, and spanned a total of about  <dig>  bp that represent about 1% of the genome length. these sequences mapped mainly to the chromosomes of cfn <dig> and ciat <dig> , with a lower proportion  distributing to plasmids. we generated a concatenated alignment of these shared segments according to the gene order found in the cfn <dig> genome, and then inferred a consensus sequence and computed the number of nucleotide differences across windows of  <dig> bp. using this procedure, we detected the patterns of shared and unique  snps particular to each strain. as shown in figure  <dig>  we were able to distinguish two classes of shared snps: biallelic snps , which showed only one nucleotide difference with respect to the consensus; and polyallelic , which showed multiple differences at the same nucleotide site with respect to the consensus. some of these snp patterns were shared in some strains but not others. for example, as shown in figure  <dig>  pattern a was shared by strains ciat <dig>  ciat <dig> and 8c- <dig>  whereas pattern b was found in strains gr <dig>  ie <dig> and kim <dig>  further shared patterns were identified through a careful inspection of the plot. in addition, a large number of polymorphisms were not shared, but instead appeared to be strain-specific variants. interestingly, strain cfn <dig> was found to have the greatest number of differences with respect to the consensus . even thought this approach is limited by the amount of common segments among the eight strains, we were able to cover  <dig> %  of the total gene content  of the cfn <dig> reference strain that include the main cog categories and subcategories . for instance, metabolism ; cellular processes and signaling ; information storage and processing ; and poorly characterized proteins . a detailed annotation of the gene segments can be seen in additional file  <dig> table s <dig> 

phylogenetic congruence
since recombination can distort phylogenetic trees such a way that no two individual trees are topologically equivalent, we decided to perform phylogenetic reconstructions using a) a neighbor-joining network  <cit> ; and b) a comparison of a consensus tree with individual trees constructed using the  <dig> segments common to the eight studied r. etli genomes and r. leguminosarum bv viciae  <dig> . the consensus trees obtained from the concatenated alignments had identical topologies when constructed by maximum likelihood, bayesian, and neighbor joining network methods . only the tree based on neighbor joining network is shown in figure  <dig>  this tree was found to contain six internal branches . there are two main clusters in the tree, separated by branches  <dig> and  <dig> that group the most closely related strains: one containing kim <dig>  ie <dig>  and gr <dig>  and another grouping brasil <dig>  8c <dig>  and ciat <dig> . these branches are internal in relation to branch  <dig>  which separates cfn <dig>  ciat <dig>  and rleg that are the strains with the longest branches . a few inconsistencies were found among the topologies recovered from reconstructions based on individual gene segments , as compared to the topology of the consensus tree . these alternative topologies are mainly due to the position of ciat <dig> and rleg, whereas the splits  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> where consistently recovered. thirty out of  <dig> trees supported the placement of rleg as the most distant strain,  <dig> trees supported placement of ciat <dig> as the external strain, whereas the most frequent topology shows that these strains are equally distant to the rest of strains . these alternative topologies could be the result of shared ancestral polymorphisms, as suggested by the long branches coupled with low frequency of recombination. altogether, the phylogenetic reconstructions suggested that the levels of recombination were insufficient to erase the phylogenetic signal, thus allowing for the identification of the most probable strain tree. consistent with this conclusion, only nine  of the  <dig> gene segments common among the eight r. etli strains  showed at least one recombination event.

extent of recombination
to evaluate the extent of the probable recombination events among strains of r. etli, we performed a recombination analysis in orthologous quartets . we aligned the shared gene segments from each draft genome with the corresponding segments of the orfs from cfn <dig>  ciat <dig>  and the r. leguminosarum bv viciae  <dig> complete genomes, yielding six different groups of quartets . the proportion of aligned segments varied across the six groups of quartets, from ~ <dig>  segments in the group containing brasil <dig>  to ~ <dig>  in the group containing ciat <dig>  the segments ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length and covering approximately 50% of the genome . for each group of quartets, we performed four different recombination tests , and determined the number of recombination events  for each quartet  . the lowest proportions of recombination events were detected for the quartets containing strains brasil <dig> and 8c- <dig>  which showed  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  recombination events, respectively. the other groups showed approximately twice as many recombination events, with frequencies ranging from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % . in addition, for each group of recombinant quartets, we determined the number of events of recombination between pairs of strains . in general, recombination events were more frequently predicted between r. etli strains pairs than between any given r. etli strain and r. leguminosarum bv viciae  <dig> . for instance, in the group of quartets containing brasil <dig>  the percentage of recombinant segments is about 7% in cfn42-rleg, 5% in brasil5-rleg, and 20% in ciat652-rleg pairs, whereas recombinant segments were detected more frequently between pairs of r. etli strains: 18% , 25% , and 25% . the same pattern was seen for the other five groups of quartets. this effect is because homologous recombination depends on a high nucleotide identify, and greater divergence is associated with less homologous recombination  <cit> . therefore, recombination might be more frequent between strains  that are closely related. indeed, we observed the same recombination events in different groups of quartets , as indicated by a presence/absence matrix. in general, the number of common recombination events  was related to the phylogenetic proximity of the strains, for instance brasil <dig> and 8c- <dig> share the most recombination events in common .

to explore whether the recombination is particularly acting on some classes of genes, we assigned the recombinant segments to cogs , as shown additional file  <dig> figure s <dig>  all the functional classes annotated in the cfn <dig> genome are present in the draft genomes but they are represented unevenly in the recombinant segments. for instance, the categories: amino acid transport and metabolism, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, energy production and conversion, lipid transport and metabolism, general function prediction only and function unknown appear overrepresented among the recombinant segments. in counterpart, some other categories like transcription and signal transduction mechanisms are in lower frequency among the recombinant segments than in cfn <dig>  even though we performed a chi-square and range tests  <cit>  to assess the significance of these differences, the incomplete nature of draft genomes does not allow to conclude about some bias toward recombination in certain classes of genes.

genetic diversity
together the above-described data suggest that recombination may not be a major driver of genomic diversification in r. etli, but rather might have relatively limited effects. to directly examine this point, we estimated the mean nucleotide diversity per nucleotide site  for the recombinant and non-recombinant gene segments of each strain . in general, recombinant segments showed higher π values than non-recombinant segments. these differences were significant only for strains ciat <dig>  gr <dig>  ie <dig> and kim <dig> , but the combined data for the π values of the  <dig> recombinant and non-recombinant gene segments common to the eight strains showed the lowest π values . although there was no significant difference between recombinant  and non-recombinant segments  with regard to the regions common to all eight strains , most of the recombinant segments had higher-than-average π values and generally showed the highest transition/transversion ratios . since the probability of transitions is higher than transversions  <cit> , high ratios of transition/transversion suggest that they were under strong purifying selection, because transitions at the third 'wobble' position are more likely to be synonymous than transversions  <cit> .

discussion
in the present work, we used a genomic approach to detect and measure variation in the form of snps, and to analyze the contribution of recombination to the genomic diversification of r. etli strains. our results demonstrated that draft genomic sequences samples representing ~1× of the genome can be used to measure variation at the whole-genome level in this species. in r. etli we found a great amount of variation  when any draft genome was compared to the complete genomes of cfn <dig> and ciat <dig>  to assess the reliability of this method for identifying snps, we quantified the snps in e. coli genomes at 1× and in complete genomes assembled at about 10× coverage. we found the same variation level using either draft or complete e. coli genomes, indicating that draft genomes produced estimations of dna variability comparable to those generated using complete genomes even at only 1× coverage. richter and roselló-mora  <cit>  previously reported on the use of partial sequences representing about 20% of the genomes of several bacterial species to infer reliable values of dna divergence between strains. the authors of the prior paper showed that ani values obtained with these samples correlated well with the ddh values, indicating that draft genome sequences are an acceptable data source. at present, the rapid improvement of dna sequencing technology is allowing researchers to use multiplex sequencing to simultaneously process an increasing number of genomic sequences. these experiments will produce additional draft genome sequences of different qualities, and the approach proposed herein should prove useful for their early analysis.

we identified a higher proportion of snps in r. etli strains than in e. coli strains, and the differences between the various r. etli strains and rhizobium leguminosarum bv viciae  <dig> ranged from 7% to 11% , with the latter figure corresponding to the cfn <dig> comparison. r. etli and r. leguminosarum are different species according to 16s comparison; however, they share a common genomic core and are distinguished by variable accessory components   <cit> . therefore, an anv range of 7-11% might be a good indicator of speciation within rhizobium. despite of the variability in anv among the tested strains of r. etli , none had anv values comparable to those obtained with respect to r. leguminosarum. the levels of anv were higher for comparisons using cfn <dig> than those done with ciat <dig>  for taxonomic purposes, cfn <dig> is the type strain of r. etli  <cit> . in the present analysis, however, we found that cfn <dig> was the most differentiated of the studied samples, had the highest proportion of unique snps, and clustered as a divergent independent branch when the strain phylogeny was explored. we recently re-sequenced strain cfn <dig> using solexa-illumina technology and compared it with the former complete genome sequence. very few indels and snps  and no rearrangements were found. therefore, very small variation can be expected from an in vitro lifestyle. in contrast, most of the strains analyzed were more closely related to ciat <dig> than to cfn <dig>  a prior study noted that ciat <dig> and cfn <dig> have a low ani value   <cit>  and suggested that ciat <dig> is improperly classified as r. etli. we previously showed that cfn <dig> and ciat <dig> share a very conserved symbiotic plasmid, but have high divergence throughout the rest of their genomes  <cit> . given that all isolates of r. etli have been recovered from nitrogen-fixing bean nodules, this characteristic would be expected to dominate the classification criteria. the genomic divergence described herein is thus consistent with a model in which the species r. etli is composed of divergent genomic lineages that share the symbiotic phenotype conferred by the symbiotic plasmid  <cit> , which is called a common symbiovar  <cit> . indeed, our analysis suggests that in some instances, the use of type strains could lead to misleading taxonomic classifications, especially when gene transfer mechanisms are active. r. etli is known to have mobile elements such as conjugative plasmids, insertion sequences and bacteriophages  <cit> . therefore, gene flow and recombination among strains of r. etli might be important to the production of genomic diversity, as reflected in its pangenomic structure  <cit> . however, no prior study has assessed the role of homologous recombination in promoting the genomic diversity of r. etli. earlier works using mlee or mlst concluded that r. etli populations are essentially clonal, with low recombination even in sympatric populations  <cit> . more recently, flores et al.  <cit>  showed that despite the high conservation of the symbiotic plasmid psym sequences from a collection of different strains of r. etli, some regions shared identical snp distribution profiles. this observation was interpreted as evidence of homologous recombination. here, we obtained similar findings for a set of common genomic dna segments, mainly chromosomal in origin, belonging to eight strains of r. etli. quantification of probable recombination events and the extrapolation of our findings to the whole genome suggested that a minimum of  <dig> recombination events had occurred in the genome of each strain. strains cfn <dig> and ciat <dig> were the more variable in terms of snps, and the latter also showed the most evidence for recombinant events in our quartet analysis . even though there were some discrepancies within the clades of the various phylogenetic trees we generated, most of the trees were congruent with the consensus tree. moreover, although the estimated recombination was correlated with genetic diversity , it was low overall . in comparison, the whole-genome recombination estimates reported for rickettsia and streptococcus were on the order of 18-37% and 28%, respectively  <cit> . these data suggest that only a minor fraction of the r. etli genome has undergone recombination, which thus accounts for only a low proportion of the polymorphism in this species.

in bacteria, the frequency of reca-mediated homologous recombination depends on the level dna identity, and small dna fragments are often introduced into the cell via conjugation, transformation or transduction. consequently, only a fraction of the genome might be targeted by recombination  <cit> . several other factors might account for the low recombination frequency detected in the isolate of r. etli studied here. among them, the ample degree of divergence among the studied r. etli strains, their distant geographical origins   <cit> , and the small number of sampled strains. recently, bailly et al., reported a population genomics analysis of sympatric strains of sinorhizobium medicae  <cit> . they found very low levels of polymorphism and recombination in the chromosome in comparison with the megaplasmids. future studies using our methodology on r. etli isolates from single sites could be used to improve our understanding of how recombination impacts the diversification of this species.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results and the previous reports on r. etli support a model in which the species is composed of evolutionarily independent lineages that share a symbiotic phenotype but have low levels of recombination among the various lineages. however, although genetic barriers imposed by divergence or other barriers such as geographical distance might preclude homologous recombination among the strains, gene flow  is an ongoing process that shapes the genomic and pangenomic structures of r. etli.
