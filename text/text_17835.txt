BACKGROUND
the evolutionarily conserved wnt signaling pathway regulates various developmental processes during embryogenesis and plays an important role for tissue homeostasis in adults. wnt signaling pathway also plays an important role in tumorigenesis, particularly the formation of inherited and sporadic colorectal cancer as result of adenomatous polyposis coli  mutation that leads to β-catenin accumulation in the nucleus  <cit> . nuclear beta-catenin binds to and functions as a cofactor of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor   <cit>  and t cell factors   <cit>  to stimulate the transcription of wnt target genes  <cit> . wnt-β-catenin signaling is essential in sustaining the cancer stem cell phenotype and is also involved in the transformation into malignant human squamous cell carcinomas  <cit> . the loss of wnt signaling pathway component apc in stem cells results in progressively growing neoplasia  <cit> . activation of wnt/tcf pathway is also a determinant of lung adenocarcinoma metastasis to brain and bone. the phenotype of those metastatic derivatives of adenocarcinoma resembles the bronchioalveolar stem cells  <cit> . thus, it holds promises to prevent and/or treat cancers by targeting wnt signaling pathway components.

traf-binding domain , one of deubiquitination enzymes, was recently reported to specifically and positively regulate wnt signaling pathway  <cit> . trabid is composed of a traf-binding domain in the c-terminus and three zinc-finger  motifs at the n-terminus  <cit> . trabid preferentially binds to lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains , but not k48-linked polyubiquitin chains , and specifically cleaves k <dig> chains  <cit> . k63-linked ubiquitination was suggested to regulate substrate activity rather than protein stability  <cit> . the catalytic residues of trabid reside in the otu  domain within the traf-binding domain  <cit> .

the otu domain is conserved within the members of the otu family of dubs that include a <dig> and possess the cysteine protease activity  <cit> . trabid was also shown to bind to apc and may be responsible for its deubiquitination. however, the direct interaction between apc and trabid was not detected  <cit> . knockdown of trabid with rnai resulted in downregulated expression of canonical wnt target genes and decreased wnt transcription activity, whereas its knockdown does not affect tnf- <dig> pathway  <cit> . epistasis analysis suggested that trabid might act downstream of beta-catenin stabilization and affect the interaction of beta-catenin with lef <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, trabid heterozygosity suppressed the rough eye phenotype caused by ectopic wingless expression in fly, but did not affect the phenotypes caused by the inhibition of notch signaling or inhibition of egf signaling. these results suggest that trabid might be a potential drug target for controlling wnt pathway activation  <cit> .

in this study, we screened for small molecule inhibitors of trabid by employing a combination of structure based virtual screening and an in vitro dub assay. we searched for compounds in a chemical library from the national cancer institute that potentially bind to trabid catalytic site based on the crystal structure of a <dig> catalytic domain  <cit> . we identified several compounds that are able to inhibit the dub activity of trabid. however, these inhibitors failed to show inhibitory effects on wnt activity. furthermore, neither shrnas that silenced trabid efficiently nor overexpression of wild type  trabid or its dub activity-deficient mutant showed inhibitory effects on canonical wnt signaling activity.

RESULTS
to screen for compounds that can inhibit trabid dub activity in vitro, we established an assay to measure the dub activity of trabid. consistent with the previous report by tran et al.  <cit> , we observed that recombinant trabid proteins purified from an e coli expression system or pulled down from hek <dig> cells overexpressing flag-trabid by an flag antibody were able to specifically cleave hexa-k <dig> , but not penta-k <dig> , ubiquitin chains. we also tested a trabid dub-deficient mutant containing a substitution mutation , a residue located in the otu domain and critical for its catalytic activity  <cit> . the mutation abrogated the ability of trabid to cleave the hexa-k <dig> ubiquitin substrate , confirming the importance of this residue for the dub activity. homology modeling of trabid otu domain based on the crystal structure of a <dig> otu domain  <cit>  revealed that the common cysteine catalytic site was well conserved in trabid. this site is characterized by a cysteine residue that forms an electrostatic network with a histidine and a residue with an acidic side chain. in trabid, these  <dig> residues are c <dig>  h <dig> and d <dig>  respectively, based on the homology model .

searching on the surface of the equilibrated structure of trabid otu domain modeled from the crystal structure of a <dig> otu revealed that there was a potential pocket adjacent to the catalytic center of otu . this pocket is part of a distal ubiquitin binding site at the catalytic site in a <dig>  <cit> . because of its spatial proximity to the catalytic site and its role in ubiquitin binding, it is reasonable to postulate that targeting this site may block the entrance of the substrates and hence inhibit the otu dub activity. of note, during the molecular dynamics refinement, considerable conformational changes occurred in this site, making it more expanded comparing with the pocket size in the a <dig> crystal structure .

we performed hierarchical virtual screening towards this pocket as described in the “materials and methods”, and requested  <dig> compounds that were ranked highest in the virtual screen and were provided with  <dig> by nci. these  <dig> compounds were screened for their abilities to inhibit the cleavage of hexa-k <dig> ubiquitin by trabid. seventeen of these compounds showed more than  <dig> percent  and five showed between 25– <dig> percent  inhibition of trabid dub activity. figure 2a shows a representative western blot used in the trabid dub activity assay. all of the positive compounds were retested in a dose-dependent experiment. figure 2b shows the data for the two of the strongest inhibitors, which showed the ic <dig> values of about  <dig> μm. neither compound showed significant inhibition of a <dig> up to  <dig> μm, though both inhibited a <dig> at  <dig> μm . compound nsc <dig> as well as a number of other compounds shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  which share similar chemical structures to nsc <dig> and nsc <dig> , did not inhibit trabid dub activity , suggesting that the two hydroxyl groups and their locations on the benzene ring may be important for the inhibitory activity. the molecular modeling of the bindings of nsc <dig>  nsc <dig> and nsc <dig> to trabid otu domain suggests that while all three compounds can form electrostatic interactions with the side chain of e <dig> and the backbone nh of t <dig>  both nsc <dig> and nsc <dig> can form an additional hydrogen bond with the side chain of s <dig> . moreover, nsc <dig> can form another hydrogen bond with the side chain of s <dig>  and its one of methyl groups provides extra hydrophobic interaction with the carbon atoms located at the side chain of r <dig> . the rescoring of binding free energies by icm shows that the binding free energies of nsc <dig> and nsc <dig> with trabid otu are quite similar , while the binding free energy of nsc <dig> with trabid otu is − <dig>  kcal/mol, which is  <dig>  kcal/mol higher than nsc <dig>  on the other hand, the calculated binding free energies of nsc <dig> and nsc <dig> with a <dig> otu are − <dig>  kcal/mol and − <dig>  kcal/mol, respectively. as the high binding free energy means a lower binding affinity, our modeling predictions are consistent with our experimental data. trabid was shown to play a positive role in canonical wnt signaling, and its dub activity appeared to be essential for this function  <cit> . we hence tested the trabid dub inhibiting compounds for their effects on canonical wnt signaling. sw <dig> or hct <dig> colorectal cancer cell lines, which were used in the previous study for trabid’s role in wnt signaling  <cit> , were transfected with a wnt reporter gene construct topflash and incubated with compounds for  <dig> hrs. because these two cell lines contain mutations in the apc and β-catenin genes, respectively, there was high reporter gene activity in these cells . however, neither nsc <dig> nor nsc <dig> inhibited the reporter gene activity . as controls knockdown β-catenin resulted in significant reduction in wnt reporter gene activity . we also tested other trabid inhibitors in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  and none of them inhibited the reporter gene activity . we then examined two endogenous wnt target gene expression. neither axin <dig> nor c-myc expression in sw <dig> cells was affected by nsc <dig> or nsc <dig> treatment . these results together suggest that trabid might not be involved in wnt$β-catenin-mediated gene transcription regulation. to further evaluate the role of trabid in the regulation of wnt/β-catenin-mediated gene transcription, we generated  <dig> constructs that produce six independent shrnas for trabid. when these shrnas were coexpressed with trabid cdna in hek <dig> cells, they showed varying efficiencies in suppressing trabid expression with shtrbd <dig> and  <dig> being the most efficiency and shtrbd <dig> and  <dig> showing little effects . we also evaluated their knockdown efficiencies using quantitative rt-pcr analysis of rnas from yfp-positive hct <dig> transfectants  . however, expression of these shrnas had no inhibitory effect on wnt reporter gene expression in either sw <dig> or hct- <dig> cells . these shrnas also did not show inhibitory effect on the expression of endogenous wnt target gene axin <dig> in sw <dig> cells . furthermore, overexpression of wildtype trabid or its dub-deficient mutant had little effects on wnt reporter gene expression in either sw <dig> or hct- <dig> cells  or in hek <dig> cells . thus, we failed to demonstrate that trabid has an important role in wnt target gene expression regulation in these two cancer cells.

nevertheless, both trabid inhibitors nsc <dig> and nsc <dig>  but not the non-active analog nsc <dig>  inhibited the growth of not only the colorectal tumor cell lines hct- <dig> and sw <dig>  but also two para-normal cell lines nih3t <dig> and hek <dig> at  <dig> μm . these compounds showed no effects on the growth of these cells at  <dig> μm . because of the lack of effect of compound nsc <dig> on cell growth, we believe that the effects of compounds nsc <dig> and nsc <dig> are likely due to their inhibition of the deubiquitinase activity.

wnt signaling plays a crucial role in cancer cell growth and cancer stem cell maintenance, which are believe to be responsible for cancer metastasis and poor prognosis of chemotherapy. thereby, regulation of wnt signaling holds promise in chemotherapy of cancer. trabid, one of k63-specific dub enzymes, became an attractive candidate to achieve this task since it has been reported to regulate wnt signal positively  <cit> , as inhibition of trabid presumably decreases wnt signaling activity. however, in this study, we failed to confirm the notion that trabid positively regulates canonical wnt signaling based on several lines of evidence. firstly, the compounds, which blocked trabid dub activity in vitro, failed to inhibit wnt transcription activity in two tumor cell lines whereβcatenin-mediated transcription are known to be elevated. secondly, the trabid shrnas failed to downregulate wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcription activity or endogenous wnt target gene axin <dig> mrna levels in these tumor cells. thirdly, overexpression of wt and c443s mutant trabid failed to show any effect on wnt target transcription activity. we did observe that the sirna described in the previous report  <cit>  was able to inhibit wnt reporter gene activity . one possibility is that the effect of the sirna reported in  <cit>  is off target. a less likely possibility is that a minute amount of trabid is sufficient for its regulation of wnt signaling in these cells, and our shrnas or inhibitors were not efficient enough to alter wnt activity. nevertheless, the fly data  <cit>  have already suggested that trabid might not be a core component of wnt signaling. the observation that the trabid inhibitors were able to inhibit cell growth suggests that trabid may have a role in cell growth regulation. however, the mechanisms for this role of trabid need to be further investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
we have used computation-based virtual screen to identify chemical inhibitors for trabid, but failed to confirm that trabid has a significant role in wnt signaling. nevertheless, inhibition of trabid may inhibit cell growth.
