BACKGROUND
leishmaniasis is a protozoan parasitic infection transmitted by sand flies. different species of leishmania are associated with distinct clinical forms of disease. cutaneous leishmaniasis  caused by leishmania major is usually benign; infection of human hosts leads to the development of a localized cutaneous lesion that eventually heals, leading to the generation of life long-immunity. in contrast, cl caused by l. braziliensis is distinguished from other leishmaniasis by its chronicity, latency, and tendency to metastasize in the human host  <cit> . in this disease, a single ulcer with elevated borders and a necrotic centre is frequently observed, and a chronic inflammatory response develops despite the paucity of parasites. in 1–5% of patients, muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis may occur due to the intrinsic ability of l. braziliensis to persist within lesion scars after spontaneous or chemotherapy-mediated healing and its ability to metastasize to the nasal mucosa  <cit> .

leishmania parasites are transmitted to the vertebrate host when the sand fly probes for a blood meal. during blood feeding, sand fly saliva, which contains a great variety of hemostatic, inflammatory, and immunomodulatory molecules , is injected into the host's skin. sand fly saliva is also known to facilitate parasite survival  <cit> . the enhancing effects of sand fly saliva on disease development are associated with its ability to inhibit several functions of antigen presenting cells  such as antigen presentation and nitric oxide  production  <cit> . we have recently shown, using an experimental model of infection, that pre-exposure to lutzomyia intermedia saliva is able to enhance infection with leishmania braziliensis  <cit> . importantly, individuals with active cutaneous leishmaniasis also showed higher humoral immune responses to l. intermedia saliva compared to control subjects, suggesting an association between positive anti-saliva immune response and the development of disease. therefore, we were interested in determining the effects of l. intermedia saliva in a more restricted experimental system, employing lps-stimulated human monocytes alone or infected with leishmania braziliensis. this approach has already been undertaken with p. papatasi  <cit>  and with l. longipalpis  <cit> , with which it was shown that saliva impairs cytokine production and co-stimulatory molecule expression on human monocytes and dendritic cells. monocytes and dendritic cells are present in the hemorrhagic pool created by sand fly feeding and are, therefore, exposed to sand fly saliva. because of this, we have examined the effects of saliva from l. intermedia, the main vector of l. braziliensis in brazil, on human monocytes stimulated with lps and uninfected or infected with l. brazilienis. understanding how salivary products interfere with lps-induced co-stimulatory molecule expression, cytokine production, and parasite infection may help clarify the complex vector-parasite-human host interplay.

RESULTS
within their saliva, sand flies have evolved an array of potent pharmacological components which induce a favorable microenvironment for adequate blood feeding and which may also be important for parasite establishment . l. intermedia is the sand fly species responsible for the transmission of leishmania braziliensis, the causative agent of cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis; thus, we have investigated the effects of l. intermedia saliva on the host's immune response in terms of surface molecule expression and cytokine production. initially, we found that human monocytes stimulated with l. intermedia sgs alone did not secrete detectable levels of il-12p <dig> or of tnf-α . for that reason, we opted to set up an experimental system in which human monocytes were pre-treated with l. intermedia sgs and were then stimulated with lps. in cultures that were pre-treated with sgs, we observed a significant decrease in il- <dig> production without significant changes in terms of il- <dig>  tnf-α or il-12p <dig> production . modulation of cytokine profiles following exposure to sand fly sgs has already been described; p. papatasi saliva was shown to decrease the production of type  <dig> cytokines and to enhance the production of il- <dig> by monocytes  <cit> . sand fly saliva from three different species was able to suppress the mitogen-induced proliferative response of murine spleen cells  <cit> . last, costa et al.  <cit>  showed, using the same experimental system employed herein, that l. longipalpis sgs inhibits tnf-α and il- <dig> production while augmenting il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il-12p <dig> production. in that work, it was proposed that components in that sand-fly saliva may promote the development of a cell-mediated immune response through the up-regulation of il- <dig> and inhibition of il- <dig> production. to that end, development of a delayed-type hypersensitivity  response was associated with protection against leishmaniasis induced by immunization with sp <dig>  a protein present in p. papatasi saliva  <cit> .

co-stimulatory molecules play an essential role in the activation and maintenance of t-cell responses. we thus analyzed whether pre-exposure to l. intermedia saliva had any effect on cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and hla-dr expression. monocytes were pre-treated with sgs and stimulated with lps, and surface molecule expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. surprisingly, pre-treatment with sgs was able to significantly increase the mean fluorescence intensity  of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and hla-dr on human monocytes . such up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecule expression was not observed with l. longipalpis sgs  <cit> , indicating once again that salivary components of these two sand fly species induce different immunomodulatory effects. we can speculate that the increase in co-stimulatory molecule expression observed with l. intermedia saliva may be related to the decreased levels of il- <dig>  since it was shown that interleukin- <dig> differentially regulates b7- <dig>  and b7- <dig>  expression on human peripheral blood dendritic cells  <cit> . class ii mhc molecules are required for the activation of cd <dig> t cells and protection against l. major  <cit> . cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and ctla- <dig> also influence the immune response to leishmania  <cit> . the increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules also enhances antigen presentation that, ultimately, may lead to increased t cell activation and ifn-γ production. indeed, cutaneous leishmaniasis is associated with an intense inflammatory reaction  <cit> . given these results, we then investigated whether the immune modulation exerted by l. intermedia saliva would affect parasite load upon monocyte infection with l. braziliensis. to address this hypothesis, human monocytes were pre-treated with l. intermedia saliva, stimulated with lps, and then infected with l. braziliensis. notably, we observed a significant increase in tnf-α, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> production upon parasite infection in cultures pre-treated with sgs, whereas il- <dig> levels did not change . we did not detect significant differences in cd <dig>  hla-dr  or in cd <dig> expression . however, up-regulation of the production of tnf-α, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> following pre-treatment with l. intermedia sgs and l. braziliensis infection did not change the parasite load as measured by the number of infected monocytes  or by the number of amastigotes per infected monocyte .

norsworthy et al.  <cit>  also failed to detect significant changes in the infection rate of l. amazonensis in murine macrophages that were pre-treated with l. longipalpis saliva, despite the significantly higher il- <dig> mrna levels observed. however, addition of maxadilan, the potent vasodilatory peptide present in l. longipalpis saliva, alone was able to up-regulate il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tgf-β and to increase the l. major parasite load  <cit> . we are currently investigating l. intermedia and l. longipalpis saliva in terms of differences or similarities in immunomodulatory compounds and preliminary results indicate that maxadilan is not abundant in l. intermedia saliva . sds-page profiles of salivary proteins from both sand fly species showed bands migrating at similar molecular weights, although l. intermedia immune sera does react with any protein present in l. longipalpis sgs with the exception of the ~ <dig> kda protein  <cit> , indicating differences in the immunogenicity of salivary molecules.

it is well known that th <dig> mediated immunity is important for the control of leishmania infection and that oxidants produced by ifn-γ activated macrophages are the main final effector molecules killing leishmania . in mice exposed to l. intermedia sgs, a further inoculation of l. intermedia sgs induced an important inflammatory response comprised of numerous polymorphonuclear and few mononuclear cells  <cit> . we can thus hypothesize that the increase in il- <dig> production induced by l. intermedia saliva may lead to neutrophil recruitment and, consequently, the successful establishment of infection. moreover, it will also be interesting to determine whether l. intermedia saliva also exerts effects on the effector functions of t-lymphocytes, employing, for example in vitro priming systems  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we can conclude that the effects exerted by l. intermedia saliva on human monocytes are different from those observed with l. longipalpis saliva  <cit> , maxadilan alone  <cit>  and p. papatasi saliva  <cit>  and such differences may play an important role regarding the outcome of leishmaniasis. moreover, since it has been proposed that vaccinating against sand fly salivary components can protect the host from infection , our observations also suggest a note of caution regarding the development of vaccines based on sand fly saliva.
