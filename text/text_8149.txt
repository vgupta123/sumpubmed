BACKGROUND
comparative genomics is a powerful method for identifying the potential functions of previously uncharacterized genes, allowing their distribution among the kingdoms of life to be characterized, and the changes in sequence and regulation underpinning their conserved or divergent functions to be tracked  <cit> . comparative genomics has been enormously facilitated by progress in bioinformatics tools, comprising the enormous amount of information available from databases concerning protein localization  <cit> , viability  <cit> , protein expression  <cit> , genetic interactions  <cit>  and protein-protein interactions  <cit> . these resources are usually focused on one particular organism  and are therefore mainly used by the small part of the scientific community working with this organism and able to handle the outcome and limitations. attempts have been made to correlate large datasets across species, for example in the case of protein-protein interactions  <cit> . these cross-correlation analyses are based on the presumption that sequence and structural similarities between gene products can be used to assess functional similarities  <cit>  and could in principle be extended to protein localization, viability or partners.

genomics should be particularly powerful in the case of gtp binding proteins , which despite extraordinary functional diversity are all believed to have evolved from a single common ancestor  <cit> . as a result, all known gtpases have a conserved switch mechanism of action, core structure and sequence motifs. these proteins are found in all domains of life and are involved in such essential processes as vesicular trafficking, protein translation, intracellular signal transduction and cell cycle progression  <cit> . gtp binding proteins are often described as molecular switch proteins because of their particular mode of action. binding and hydrolysis of gtp results in conformational changes in the so-called switch regions of the protein, which define the active gtp- and the inactive gdp-bound forms; these are used, for instance, for regulating receptor activation and cargo recruitment to membranes  <cit> .

we have used comparative genomics to identify and characterize the human homologue of the yeast protein lsg <dig>  here, we describe a novel family of gtp binding proteins, which we have named yrg . members of this family contain a central gtpase domain showing a unique circular permutation of the known g motifs of the gtp binding proteins. a phylogenetic analysis was used for cross-species comparisons, focusing on sub-cellular localization, cell viability and the known functions of each subfamily member. this analysis showed that yrg family members are essential, have increased in eukaryotes as cell compartmentalizationhas evolved, and show functional conservation in relation to rrna maturation.

RESULTS
recently, we have localized more than  <dig> human proteins in living cells with the aim of gaining preliminary functional data  <cit> . analysis of these proteins for sequences exhibiting characteristic gtpase motifs such as the p-loop  <cit>  allowed us to identify a subset of proteins as putative gtpases.

human lsg1p defines a highly conserved gtpase protein family
one of these proteins possesses a central gtpase domain defined in the pfam database of protein domains  <cit>  as the mmr/hsr <dig> domain, a coiled coil, and a potential nuclear localization signal  . no additional structural or enzymatic domains could be identified in the protein sequence using the smart domain research server  <cit> . interestingly, this gtpase domain is circularly permuted  <cit> , in contrast to the canonical organization of gtpases based on the small gtpase ras  <cit> . this circular permutation is unique, and it is surprising in view of the structure of the gtpase p-loop domain  <cit> . it implies that the four highly conserved elements of the gtpase that mediate interactions with the guanine nucleotides and effector proteins, known as the g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> motifs, are circularly permuted and reorganized, since g <dig> is followed by g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig>  <cit>  .

a blast search for similar protein sequences  <cit>  shows that this unusual gtpase is present as a single copy per genome  <cit>  . only one member of the family has so far been experimentally defined, namely the lsg <dig> protein in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . accordingly, we named the human protein hlsg <dig> . all orthologues of hlsg <dig> possess a central mmr/hsr <dig> domain belonging to kog <dig> in the database of clusters of orthologous genes  <cit> . the identity between aligned sequences ranges from 31% to 88%. interestingly, except in the e. cuniculi member, the gtpase domain contains an unusual insertion in comparison to the canonical gtpase structure. this insertion separates the g <dig> element from the remaining gtpase elements  .

in order to elucidate the potential function of hlsg <dig>  we extended our phylogenetic analysis. owing to their unique structure, circularly permuted gtpases have previously been reported  <cit>  and partially grouped into the yawg/ylqf family   <cit> , which is mainly restricted to prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes . this family contains five subfamilies: yjeq , mj <dig>  yqeh, ylqf and yawg. the latter three branches have eukaryotic members, ylqf representing the ancestor of hlsg <dig>  interestingly, while the yqeh subfamily is limited to only one member per species , and the yjeq subfamily is mainly restricted to bacteria  <cit> , the ylqf subfamily shows a large expansion of this gene family in eukarya . the ylqf subfamily can be further subdivided into five clades: ylqf , mtg <dig> , lsg <dig> , nog <dig> , and nug <dig>  according to the s. cerevisiae nomenclature. the ylqf family expands further in coelomates  and in deuterostomia  .

next, we exploited the experimental data from a comprehensive large-scale localization screen in yeast  <cit>  and we conducted literature searches to deduce the possible cellular localizations of the different family members, ranging from the nucleolus to the mitochondria. the nucleolus is the compartment in which the large ribosomal rna precursor  is synthesized, processed into the mature 18s,  <dig> s, and 28s rrnas and assembled with proteins to form ribosomal subunits that move to the nucleoplasm and are finally exported to the cytoplasm. mitochondria and chloroplasts also possess a set of ribosomes. all yeast members  are involved in ribosome biogenesis  <cit> , and yjeq binds to the ribosome in e. coli  <cit> . finally, using chlorop  <cit>  to predict proteins localized to the chloroplast, we detected a sixth subfamily in ylqf, called chylqf , and a second subfamily in yqeh, called chyqeh . these are only found in plant genomes and group in the phylogenetic tree with the cyanobacteria yrg and yqeh members .

nucleotide binding and gtpase activity of hlsg1
lsg1-related proteins contain motifs that have been found to be important for guanine nucleotide binding and gtpase activity in a variety of cellular proteins  <cit> . lsg1-related proteins contain the g1- <dig> motifs typical of gtpases , suggesting that members of this family are likely to exhibit guanine nucleotide binding and gtpase activity. however, direct experimental evidence for this has been lacking so far, except for the distantly related bacterial homologues yjeq  <cit> , ylqf and yqeh  <cit> . to test this function in human lsg <dig>  we examined the binding of  gtp to purified his tagged-hlsg <dig> using as control a his-tagged sar1p, a well characterized gtpase regulating the vesicular coat complex copii  <cit> . as shown in figure 2a, hlsg <dig> binds to  gtp, although more weakly than sar1p. however, hlsg <dig> did not bind gdp under those experimental conditions , which may reflect weak binding. to determine the gtpase activity of hlsg <dig>  we performed a gtpase assay using an hplc system as previously described  <cit> . in this assay, purified recombinant hlsg <dig> showed a low gtpase activity that proceeded to gmp and induced the further hydrolysis of gdp through gmp to guanosine. such low gtpase activities have previously been observed in the distantly related bacterial homolog yjeq  <cit> , but also in gtpases in general, since their activities rely heavily on co-factors such as gaps   <cit>  or gefs   <cit> . moreover, other gtpases such as the interferon-induced 67-kda guanylate-binding protein  have been shown not to limit their hydrolysis to gdp  <cit> . to confirm our observations indicating that hlsg <dig> has gtpase activity, we immunoprecipitated endogenous hlsg <dig> from a hela cell extract using a polyclonal antibody raised against purified hlsg <dig>  and analyzed the gtpase activity of the precipitate . the gtpase activity was four times higher  than that of in vitro purified recombinant hlsg <dig> and gdp was the only final product . these data demonstrate gtpase activity in a eukaryotic member of the ylqf family for the first time.

hlsg <dig> is an essential protein, a characteristic of yrg family members
yeast lsg <dig>  like the yeast yrg homologues nug <dig>  nog <dig> and mtg <dig>  is an essential protein  <cit> . to confirm the consequences of loss of hlsg <dig>  we transfected sirnas targeted against hlsg <dig> into hela cells, confirming the efficiency of the sirna treatment by western blot analysis . after  <dig> h, lsg <dig> expression showed a drastic decrease in cells treated with lsg <dig> sirna compared to cells treated with a negative control sirna. moreover, hlsg <dig> expression in control cells or cells transfected with the negative control shows a band shift that increases with time, as observed in proteins post-translationally modified e.g. by phosphorylation. the increase in intensity could indicate that the polyclonal antibody has a higher affinity for the modified form. there was no significant change in actin expression in control cells, or in cells treated with either random sirna or a specific hlsg <dig> sirna . however, microscopic observations during the course of the experiment showed that hela cell cultures exhibiting hlsg <dig> knockdown were less dense than control cells. in addition, hlsg <dig> knockdowns contained more apoptotic cells , suggesting a lethal effect. we confirmed this by immunostaining hlsg1-specific sirna-treated cells with a polyclonal anti-hlsg <dig> antibody and staining the cell nuclei with dapi at different times after transfection of the sirna . cell numbers decreased rapidly after treatment with the specific hlsg <dig> sirna in comparison to cells treated with oligofectamine alone or with control sirna.

we used the large datasets from gene viability screens of bacteria, worms and flies to compare our observations with data about other yrg family members. yjeq was shown to be indispensable for the growth of e. coli and b. subtilis  <cit> . in c. elegans, yrg orthologues are non-viable  . since large human rnai screens are only now in progress, no data were available for other yrg human genes. however, interestingly, overexpression of nucleostemin was shown to be lethal  <cit> .

according to our results, hlsg <dig> is essential, like its yeast counterpart, and this characteristic seems to be common to the yrg family members. this implies that each yrg protein fulfils essential functions.

hlsg <dig> localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and to discrete nuclear structures
compartmentalization of the human cell allows better control of function and reactions steps in many pathways, including ribosome assembly. cellular localization is a key to defining protein function. using large-scale localization screens, we previously identified hlsg <dig> as an endoplasmic reticulum localized protein  <cit> , in contrast to yeast lsg <dig>  which is proposed to localize specifically to the cytosol  <cit> .

we decided to confirm our preliminary data on hlsg <dig> localization in humans using gfp-fused constructs as well as specific polyclonal antibodies. when expressed as a c-terminally tagged yfp fusion protein, hlsg <dig> localized to the er in most cells . in 10% of the transfected cells, however, discrete structures in the nucleus were observed and localization to the endoplasmic reticulum was decreased or even absent . an n-terminally tagged cfp-hlsg <dig> fusion protein was also localized to the er and nuclear envelope, but more of the protein was cytosolic than in the case of the c-terminal hlsg1-yfp fusion . a truncated hlsg <dig> version  fused to the yfp, containing the potential nls, accumulated in the nucleus and nucleolus . collectively, these data indicate that the nls present in the c-terminus of hlsg <dig> is functional, in contrast to the putative nls in yeast lsg <dig>  which is reportedly restricted to the cytosol  <cit> .

immunostaining with an antibody against the entire protein showed that the endogenous protein also localized to reticular membranes, and in a fraction of the cells to a number of small punctuate nuclear structures. these results are very similar to those obtained with the hlsg1-yfp fusion protein . double staining showed that hlsg <dig> partially co-localized with an ectopically expressed fp  used to mark the er  , as well as with the nuclear envelope marker lamin b <dig> . however, hlsg <dig> was largely absent from the golgi complex, which was labeled with antibodies against the golgi membrane protein golgin <dig>  and from mitochondria, marked by antibodies against hsp <dig> . moreover, the small hlsg1-positive nuclear structures observed in a fraction of the cells co-localized with coilin, a typical marker of cajal bodies  . the cbs are functionally linked to the nucleolus and play a major role in the maturation of rnp, acting on the mrna as well as the rrna pathway  <cit> .

these data demonstrate that in contrast to its yeast counterpart, hlsg <dig> localizes to the er and to cajal bodies in the nucleus.

hlsg <dig> shuttles between the nucleus and the cytosol
the dual localization of hlsg <dig> in the cytosol and nucleus suggests nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of the protein, possibly in relation to rrna maturation. we constructed hlsg <dig> deletion mutants containing or excluding the putative the c-terminal nls  and transfected them into hela cells . while yfp-hlsg1-480- <dig> clearly localized in the nucleus, yfp-hlsg1-1- <dig>  which contains no nls, was excluded from the nucleus. moreover, yfp-hlsg1-480- <dig> colocalized in the nucleus with srp19-mrfp, a nucleolar marker  <cit> , indicating that it sublocalizes to the nucleolus.

to determine whether hlsg <dig> shuttled between nucleus and cytosol via a crm1-dependent nuclear export pathway, we transfected vero cells with either hlsg1-yfp or hlsg <dig> deletion mutants and compared the localization of the fusion proteins after treatment with the crm- <dig> nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin b  . full-length hlsg <dig>  is lmb-sensitive ; so is its c-terminal counterpart hlsg1-cfp . to confirm this, we performed the same experiment using the deletion mutants yfp-hlsg1-1- <dig> and yfp-hlsg1-480- <dig> as well as the full length yfp-hlsg <dig>  we also took intermediate time points  to obtain insights into the kinetics of hlsg <dig> shuttling. interestingly, yfp-hlsg <dig> accumulates in the nucleus over an  <dig> h period, and at  <dig> h most of the transfected cells showed punctate labeling in the nucleus reminiscent of cajal bodies. yfp-hlsg1-480- <dig> showed a permanent nuclear location and yfp-hlsg1-1- <dig> was constantly in the cytosol.

these data suggest that hlsg <dig> shuttles between the cytosol and cajal bodies via a crm1-dependent export mechanism.

discussion
using database sequence similarity searches coupled with phylogenetic analysis, we were able to unite the circularly permuted gtpases into a family that we have named yrg for ylqf related gtpases . the ylqf protein family represents the largest subfamily of yrg expansion in eukarya, which is potentially involved in ribosome biogenesis.

phylogenetic analysis defines ten gtpase subfamilies with a global phyletic distribution compatible with their presence in the last universal common ancestor  of extant life forms  <cit> . an emerging concept suggests that these universal gtpases are necessary either for ribosome function or for transmitting information from the ribosome to downstream targets to generate specific cellular responses. these are associated with translation and include four translation factors, two obg-like gtpases, the two signal-recognition-associated gtpases, the mrp subfamily of mind-like atpases and the yrg family. here we have defined the yrg family for the first time as a eukaryotic expansion of the original yawg/ylqf family  <cit>  tightly coupled to the evolution of compartmentalization.

the yrg family was originally defined as a particular class of gtpases showing a circularly permuted structure, with the four gtpase motifs reorganized as g <dig> followed by g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> . this circular permutation is unique in the gtpase superfamily. however, we have shown that this inverted structure does not seem to affect gtpase activity or folding, in agreement with other studies  <cit> . moreover, regarding the potential function of this family, it has been pointed out that most yrg members bind to the ribosome , are involved in the maturation of ribosomes or mitoribosomes  <cit> , localize to compartments related to rrna maturation , and are essential proteins . altogether, this indicates that yrg members have an essential role in ribosomal assembly.

strikingly, we could find a member of the yrg family for every cellular compartment linked to ribosomes, including the chloroplast , correlating with the expansion of the eukaryotic cell . according to the phylogenetic tree of the family, the cytosolic form block  is distinct from the nuclear form blocks , which later expanded into a nucleolar form , in parallel with the incorporation of members upon engulfment of the future mitochondria  that cluster within the ylqf branch as well as the future chloroplast . other events within the ylqf family included the appearance of a second cytosolic form upon speciation of the coelomates , which may have had an equivalent in the plant lineage, since we observed a form of lsg <dig> in a. thaliana . moreover, we observed the appearance of a second nucleolar form  upon speciation of the deuterostomes. since nucleostemin is involved in cell-cycle regulation in stem cells, we can hypothesize a direct mechanism of rrna maturation in those highly specialized animal cells. we propose the following scenario for the evolution of the yrg family. first, a cytosolic founding member was duplicated upon the formation of a proto-nucleus, allowing the rrna maturation pathway to be maintained . the second step included the engulfment of mitochondria and chloroplasts containing specific yrg forms involved in rrna maturation in these compartments. the final step involved the evolution of the cytosolic and nuclear members upon the specialization of the eukaryotic cell . this scenario accords with the work of mans et al.  <cit> , which showed by comparative genomics that a large set of proteins was involved in the formation and structure of the nuclear envelope and the pore complex: the nucleus evolved from a primordial prekaryote compartment and a primitive nuclear pore complex dependent on ran and on nug1p/nug2p, a nucleolar yrg member.

interestingly, hlsg <dig> is the only member of this family that shows a dual localization . the cytosol contains huge numbers of ribosomes freely diffusing or bound to the endoplasmic reticulum, and is the main transit pathway for rrna en route to the mitochondria or the chloroplast. cajal bodies are spherical nuclear bodies containing a variety of components including nucleolar proteins, snrnps and smn. they are dynamic structures functionally linked to the nucleolus, presumably involved in rnp maturation and related to gene expression  <cit> . consistent with these data, one could hypothesize that hlsg <dig> is a regulator of the rrna pathway that can relocate to cajal bodies and interact with specific factors such as nucleolar proteins. the observation that leptomycin b treatment leads to accumulation of hlsg <dig> in the nucleus clearly indicates shuttling via a crm1-dependent export pathway. we hypothesized that hlsg <dig> relocalizes from the cytosol to the nucleus in response to internal  or external  stimuli. in this way, hlsg <dig> would act on the control of rrna biosynthesis at its source: the nucleolus. in the future, these hypotheses will be tested for hlsg <dig> and for the other yrg family members to elucidate their role in rrna biosynthesis and maturation.

CONCLUSIONS
using comparative genomics, we defined the yrg family as a unique group of circularly permuted gtpases. we suggest a potential function for this family, as well as a potential pathway by which the family members may act sequentially, following an evolutionary process linked to compartimentalization . a future goal will be to test this hypothesis experimentally and to dissect the molecular mechanisms of action of each member of the pathway.
