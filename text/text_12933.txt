BACKGROUND
cell division is under precise regulation in eukaryotic organisms. many genes functioning in cell division are regulated and expressed right before they are needed  <cit> . these genes show periodical expression patterns with peaks at certain mitotic stages. the most effective way for identifying these genes is to analyze gene expression profiles using time course microarray. for example, in saccharomyces cerevisiae, several hundreds of periodically expressed genes have been identified based on microarray  <cit> . despite the high throughput, microarray has its limitations in terms of identifying cell cycle regulated gene. first, genes identified from different studies are poorly overlapped, presumably due to varied experimental conditions or de-synchronization problems  <cit> . second, it is often difficult to identify lowly expressed or weakly regulated genes due to technical issues  <cit> .

to overcome the limitations of microarray experiments, several computational methods have been proposed as compensatory methods to find cell cycle regulated genes in yeast. streib et al.  <cit>  predicted cell cycle regulated genes based on causal interaction using regulatory networks. wang et al.  <cit>  combined genetic interactions and co-expression data to infer candidate cell cycle regulated genes. these two methods are based on the assumption that these genes tend to possess interacting relationship with each other. alternatively, de lichtenberg et al. found that many cell cycle regulated genes shared common protein features, thus proposed a method to predict novel ones based on protein features  <cit> . these protein-level features mainly reflect cell cycle regulation at the post-translational level, such as protein stability. however, the dna sequence features, which contribute at the transcriptional level, are completely ignored by this method.

a subset of transcription factors responsible for the coordinated regulation of cell cycle genes has been uncovered  <cit> . for example, mbp <dig> is a crucial transcription factor involved in cell cycle progression from g <dig> to s phase  <cit> ; mcm1/fkh1/ndd <dig> cooperatively regulate g2/m genes through binding to their promoters  <cit> . since cell cycle regulated genes tend to be regulated by a common set of regulators, we hypothesize that whether a gene is cell cycle regulated can be inferred based on genomic features - specifically, the regulatory transcriptional factors  binding  and motifs profiles in their promoters . fortunately, in yeast the genomic occupations of most tfs have been identified with chip-chip experiment  <cit> . meanwhile, the potential regulatory cis-elements have been systematically investigated by computational analysis  <cit> . thus, we are motivated to construct statistical models to predict yeast cell cycle regulated genes based on these features.

in this study, we combined the large-scale tf binding data and motif profiles to predict cell cycle regulated genes in budding yeast. the predictive model achieved high accuracy evaluated by 10-fold cross-validations. we predicted  <dig> novel cell cycle genes and determined their potential phases . these genes are enriched for cell cycle related processes according to gene ontology  analysis and tend to be lowly expressed. the model also provided us a set of tfs significantly contributed to cell cycle gene regulation. our analysis in this work suggests that genomic features are informative for predicting periodically expressed genes. the statistical model proposed in this paper can be applied to identify cell cycle regulated genes in other organisms or broadly to genes under transcriptional level regulation.

RESULTS
genomic features are predictive of cell cycle regulated genes
considering the discrepancy of different experimental studies, we chose  <dig> periodically expressed genes  and  <dig> non-periodically expressed ones  as our training data  based on the meta-analysis in cyclebase.org  <cit>  that combines multiple yeast cell cycle time-course datasets. to examine whether transcriptional level regulation can explain the periodical expression patterns, we focused our analysis on proximal genomic features: trans-features, tf binding data from chip-chip experiments, and cis-features, motifs profiles in gene promoter regions .

specifically, for each gene we collected the binding strength of  <dig> tfs from harbison et al. <cit>  and calculated the matching score of  <dig> motifs from beer et al.  <cit>  . a penalized logistic regression model  was then fitted to classify cell cycle genes using these genomic features. we evaluated the performance of the model using 10-fold cross-validations . as shown in figure 2a, both the tf model  and the motif model  achieved fairly high accuracies with auc  scores of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. moreover, the combined tf + motif model achieved the highest predictive accuracy . these results indicate that cell cycle and non-cell cycle genes are different in their transcriptional regulation, which can be reflected by both tf binding and motif existence in their promoters. they also indicate that the two types of genomic features provide, at least partially, regulatory information from different perspectives.

in addition to the plr model, we also evaluated the performance of other methods, including logistic regression , random forest  and support vector machine . for all methods, the tf + motif model gave rise to higher accuracy than the tf or motif only models . plr model has slightly better performance and is easy to be interpreted. thus, we focused on results from this method in the subsequent analysis, but similar conclusions can be achieved when other methods are used .

we then investigated key genomic features that were critical for discriminating cell cycle genes from non-cell cycle ones. significant features  in the combined model are listed in figure 2c. positive contributors  include the trans-feature mbp <dig> and several cis-features, i.e. the motifs for mbp <dig>  mcm <dig>  swi <dig> and fkh <dig>  all of these tfs are known to be important for cell cycle regulation. mbp <dig> is the dna binding component of mbf complex, which binds to the promoters of dna synthesis genes and regulates gene expression during g1/s transition  <cit> . mcm <dig>  together with fkh <dig> or fkh <dig>  activates g2/m expressed genes through the recruitment of ndd <dig>  <cit> . it is also involved in the repression of m/g <dig> gene transcription by interacting with yox1p and yhp1p  <cit> . swi <dig> shares a similar function with mbp <dig>  it regulates late g <dig> specific target genes by forming an sbf complex with swi <dig>  <cit> . motif m <dig> is a significant predictor for cell cycle genes as identified by the model. the regulatory protein binding with this motif is not clear, but it shares certain similarity with mbp <dig> or swi <dig> binding motifs . the model also identifies several negative contributors , e.g. fhl <dig> and the binding motif of rap <dig>  these two tfs are involved in transcriptional regulation of ribosomal proteins, which are constitutively expressed at very high levels during cell growth  <cit> . generally, genes associated with positive features are more likely to be periodically expressed; conversely, genes associated with negative features are less likely to be periodical.

genomic features distinguish phase-specific cell cycle genes
based on the expression peak time, cell cycle genes can be further divided into g <dig>  s, g <dig> and m phase genes. we examined whether phase specific genes had unique genomic features that distinguish them from other periodical ones. among the  <dig> cell cycle genes,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were classified as g <dig>  s, g <dig> and m phase specific genes, respectively, based on cyclebase  <cit> . we constructed four phase-specific models to distinguish genes in one phase from the other phases with 10-fold cross-validations. as shown in figure  <dig>  genomic features are also predictive of phase-specific cell cycle genes with auc scores of g <dig>  s, g <dig>  and m phases  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. although phase classification is somehow arbitrary, the high auc scores indicate that these genomic features are informative to infer phase-specificity of genes. in table  <dig>  we listed the significant genomic features in at least one cell cycle phase. transcriptional regulation of genes at a certain phase is mainly controlled by a small number of tfs or cis-regulatory motifs. most of the significant features are previously known to be cell cycle stage specific regulators. for example, mbp <dig> is the major regulator in late g <dig> phase and swi <dig> activates gene transcription at the m/g <dig> checkpoint  <cit> . consistently, our model suggests that cell cycle genes associated with swi <dig> or mbp <dig> binding motifs are more likely to be g <dig> specific genes. in general, the positive features in one phase often contribute negatively in other phases due to the exclusive nature of these phase-specific models.

“+” denotes positive contributors; “-” means negative contributors; “**” means p value <  <dig> ; “*” means p value <  <dig> . m <dig> is predicted to be met <dig> binding motif. genomic features in more than one stage are highlighted in bold.

phase-specific models suggest some interesting findings about regulatory mechanisms. the model indicates fkh <dig> as a s-phase predictor, although it is mainly known to function at the g2/m checkpoint. this is supported by simon et al.  <cit>  showing that many s phase genes contain fkh <dig> binding sites in their promoter regions. although mbp <dig> and swi <dig> are previously known as late g <dig> regulators, our analysis suggests that swi <dig> might function later than mbp <dig>  in cyclebase, mbp <dig> reaches its expression peak during s/g <dig> stages, while swi <dig> demonstrates peak in middle g <dig> phase. consistently, motif analysis suggests that swi <dig> is likely to be regulated by mbp <dig>  the unexpected predictor for s-phase genes is m <dig>  which resembles met <dig> binding motif  . met <dig> is generally known as a transcriptional regulator of methionine biosynthetic genes  <cit> , but recently has been shown as the primary mediator of the met30-controlled cell cycle checkpoint  <cit> . spellman et al.  <cit>  also found that several s-phase genes function in methionine metabolism and contain a met32/met <dig> motif in their promoters. our analysis suggests a crosstalk between cell cycle control and metabolic regulation.

novel cell cycle regulated genes are identified by genomic feature based method
we applied the tf + motif model to predict novel periodically expressed genes. after excluding training set, we calculated the probability of genes to be cell cycle regulated. among the  <dig>  unclassified genes,  <dig> have a probability greater than  <dig>  . we then inferred their phase-specificity using penalized multinomial logistic regression . as a multi-class classification method, rmlr simultaneously calculates the probabilities of a gene to be g <dig>  s, g <dig> or m phase specific, and assigns the gene to the phase with highest probability. one can set a threshold for the highest probability to improve the prediction accuracy, i.e. assign a gene to be “unclear” if the highest probability is lower than the threshold. the performance of the rmlr model was evaluated using the positive training data  with  <dig> fold cross-validations, resulting in a multi-class auc score  <cit>  of  <dig>  . without setting threshold for highest probability, about  <dig> % of genes were correctly assigned to their peak stages; increase of the threshold led to rapid precision improvement .

among the  <dig> predicted genes,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were assigned to g <dig>  s, g <dig>  m phases, respectively, according to the maximum probability they achieved in the four phases . the higher the maximum probability, the more likely the phase is correctly assigned. these genes tend to have lower p-values in both periodicity  and regulation  than the non-cell cycle genes . as shown in figure 4b, cell cycle regulated genes in training set  have lowest pper and preg as expected, whereas non-cell cycle genes  have significantly higher values . the  <dig> novel genes have significant lower pper and preg compared to predicted non-cell cycle genes . these results indicate that these predicted genes tend to have periodical expression patterns and varied expression levels across the cell cycle. consistent with previous assumptions, our predicted genes have more physical interactions  with known cell cycle genes compared to those that are predicted not to be  .

we collected  <dig> experimental or predictive results from previous studies . out of the  <dig> predicted genes, we found that  <dig>  genes were supported by at least one evidence, as shown in figure 4c . specifically,  <dig> genes have been shown as periodical ones in at least one experiment in cyclebase  <cit> ;  <dig> are in the cell cycle gene list identified by granovskaia et al.  <cit> ; and  <dig> are reported as such by rowicka et al.  <cit> . in contrast, only  <dig> % of genes in the negative prediction set have been supported by these data sources . a recent study in fission yeast identified  <dig> cell cycle genes with long cell phenotype using knockout  <cit> . we examined the cell cycle orthologs of the  <dig> predicted cell cycle genes. out of the  <dig> genes with orthologs in fission yeast,  <dig>  are identified as cell cycle ones, with only slightly higher percentage than the predicted non-cell cycle genes . it has been shown that the overlap of periodically expressed genes between budding and fission yeast is very small  <cit> . however, the predicted cell cycle genes with orthologs that are also cell cycle related in fission yeast might be core cell cycle genes .

we investigated the functions of these  <dig> predicted cell cycle genes using gene ontology and saccharomyces genome database   <cit> . these genes are involved in a wide range of biological functions. based on sgd,  <dig> genes participate in unknown biological process and the others are involved in lipid metabolic process, response to chemical stimulus, mitotic cell cycle, cytoskeleton organization and so on . go analysis from david  <cit>   suggests the enrichment of genes related to cell walls, organelle fission, chromosome condensation, dna packaging, nuclear localization and other processes. more specifically, the predicted g1-specific genes are mostly involved in cellular metabolism, such as lipid metabolic process, cellular protein catabolic process, cytoskeleton organization and carbohydrate metabolic process. this is consistent with the concept that g <dig> phase is the interval with enhanced protein synthesis and metabolism preparing for mitosis. for the predicted s-specific genes, many are involved in cytoskeleton organization, mitotic cell cycle, organelle fission, chromosome segregation, and regulation of organelle organization. g <dig> phase is another intermediate phase preparing for mitotic process. consistently, the predicted g2-specific genes function in lipid metabolic process, carbohydrate metabolic process and other metabolic pathways. they are also involved in regulation of cell cycle, sporulation, and trans-membrane transportation. the predicted m-specific genes are mainly involved in nuclear related processes, nuclear transport, response to dna damage/chemical stimulus, signaling and dna repair. considering the complexity of cell cycle process and the intensive regulatory cooperation between different layers, it is not surprising to observe such a high diversity in functions of the predicted cell cycle genes .

for those predicted genes coding for transcription factors, we investigated their transcriptional regulators based on the yeastract database   <cit> , which provides a curated repository of regulatory associations between transcription factors  and potential target genes in yeast. we found that many of these predicted cell cycle tfs themselves were regulated by the known cell cycle regulators. for instance, cyc <dig>  mga <dig>  haa <dig>  hms <dig>  mot <dig> and tye <dig> are regulated by mbp1/swi4; yap <dig>  rsf <dig>  ume <dig> and ime <dig> are regulated by fkh1/fkh2; tfc <dig>  ime <dig>  hms <dig>  tye <dig> and zds <dig> are regulated by the m phase regulator, mcm1/ace <dig>  these tfs might function downstream of key cell cycle tfs to regulate the transcription of a specific group of genes. for example, ime <dig> is required for sporulation and has been shown as one of the major regulators that induce meiosis  <cit> . in consistency with this function, our model predicts ime <dig> to be a cell cycle gene of g2/m specific.

we also investigated the question: why these predicted genes were not identified as such by the meta-analysis in cyclebase. we found that this was mostly due to high noise of microarray data or loss of synchronization during the cell cycle induction. for example, we predicted cdc <dig> as a g1-specific gene with a probability of  <dig> . it contains a strong mbp <dig> binding motif  in its promoter region. although cdc <dig> is identified as a periodically expressed gene by one of previous studies  <cit> , it has only moderately significant overall p-value  in its periodical expression patterns according to cyclebase, and thus was not included in our positive set. we examined the expression profiles of cdc <dig> in the  <dig> experiments used by cyclebase. as shown in figure 4d, it turns out that  <dig> of these profiles demonstrate a potential peak at the g <dig> phase; however, the peak disappears after the second cell cycle, presumably due to de-synchronization of cells. another example is the serine/threonine protein kinase, cla <dig>  which is involved in mitotic exit and cytokinesis. our model predicts cla <dig> as a cell cycle regulated gene with peak expression at m/g <dig>  it shows strong binding affinity with mcm <dig>  swi <dig>  and mbp <dig>  in its promoter. binding of mcm <dig> and swi <dig> with this gene is also verified by experiments  <cit> . in consistency with our prediction, the microarray expression profiles of cla <dig> demonstrate a peak at m/g <dig>  however, it was not identified as a cell cycle gene, apparently due to the loss of periodically expression pattern from the second cell cycle .

due to technical issues, it is difficult to identify periodically expressed genes with low expression levels based on microarray  <cit> . we examined the expression levels of our  <dig> predicted genes. as shown in figure 5a, compared to the positive set, these genes are lower in their mrna expression levels  <cit>  . to some extent, our genomic feature based method can complement traditional microarray methods and uncover lowly expressed cell cycle genes.

genomic feature based model reveals circular regulation of cell cycle transcription factors
the progression of cell cycle is under precise control of a serial of interrelated tfs. it has been proposed that cell cycle tfs regulate one another in a serial manner by forming a circular regulatory chain: a tf function in one phase will regulate tfs required for next phase  <cit> . our genomic feature model recapitulates the conception. we selected the  <dig> key cell cycle tfs: swi <dig>  ace <dig>  mbp <dig>  fkh <dig>  swi <dig>  swi <dig>  ndd <dig>  fkh <dig> and mcm <dig>  and investigated their genomic features, i.e. tf binding and motif existence, in their promoter regions. we examined the inter-regulatory relationship of the  <dig> key cell cycle tfs . as shown in figure 5c, there is a clear regulatory loop formed by these tfs. mbp <dig> regulates the transcription of swi <dig>  which in turn regulates ndd <dig> as inferred by motif existence. ndd <dig>  together with fkh <dig> and/or fkh <dig>  promotes the transcription of swi <dig> 

tfs that regulates mbp <dig> and mcm <dig> is not clearly inferred from the tf binding data and motif information . mbp <dig> is periodically expressed, which might be regulated by other tfs or at the post-transcriptional level . mcm <dig> is a key regulator at m/g <dig> checkpoint, but it is constantly expressed during the cell cycle. to achieve its function, mcm <dig> cooperates with factors yox <dig> and yhp1p  <cit> , which are activated by mbp <dig> in g <dig> phase, and by ndd <dig> and fkh <dig> in g <dig> phase  <cit> . yox <dig> and yhp1p bind to positions upstream of mcm <dig> binding sites acting as gene expression repressors .

comparison with protein-feature based method
de lichtenberg et al. have applied a machine-learning method that utilized protein features  to predict cell cycle genes  <cit> . we then asked which types of features  were more informative for cell cycle gene prediction. we applied our model to the same training data used by de lichtenberg et al. the training data consists  <dig> high-confidence cell cycle genes and  <dig> non-cell cycle ones. to be consistent with their analysis, we also used  <dig> fold cross-validations to evaluate the performance of our method. as shown in figure 5d, with this training data our genomic feature based model results in an auc score of  <dig> , which is significantly higher than that of the protein feature based method . detailed examination of model performance  indicates that, as setting higher threshold, false positive rates dramatically decrease. generally, genomic features are more effective for predicting periodical expression across the cell cycle than protein features.

in addition, we compared the two plr models trained by the two different training data sets from de lichtenberg et al.  <cit>  and cyclebase, respectively. first, the two models result in similar set of significant features. specifically, the model using de lichtenberg’s training data gives rise to a total of  <dig> significant features, among which  <dig>  are shared with the model using cyclebase training data . secondly, we compared the top  <dig> most significant cell cycle genes predicted by the two models and found that  <dig> of them were overlapped. the genes in one of the top  <dig> lists are mostly predicted to have higher probabilities to be cell cycle ones in the other model.

discussion
the idea of modeling gene expression based on regulatory information has been applied to predict gene expression levels  <cit> . in this work, we used similar idea to quantify gene expression patterns assuming common mechanisms underlying cell cycle regulated genes. genomic features used in our model include trans-regulators and cis-elements. they possess complementary effect in predicting cell cycle regulated genes. trans-regulators’ binding gives the direct measure of involvement of transcription factors, whereas cis-elements give overall binding potentials of regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors and other proteins. our method suggests cell cycle progression is possibly dominated by only a few key transcription factors and these transcription factors themselves form a regulatory circuit. other cell cycle transcription factors may function downstream of these key regulators. compared to previous protein feature based method, which focused on post-transcriptional level regulation, genomic feature based method demonstrates increased prediction performance. the improvement is not surprising as transcriptional level regulation is the first and the most critical step that controls gene expression. even though our method could separate periodical genes from non-periodical ones with fair accuracy, cell cycle progression control is a much more complex system than could be simply explained by proximal transcription regulation alone. other levels of regulation, such as distal transcription regulation, protein modification, activation, localization, and degradation are also important components. these regulations may account for false positives and false negative predictions in our method. future works could focus on combining all kind of regulations together to explain cell cycle control.

one of the advantages of our method is the independence of microarray experiments in identifying novel periodical genes. as we known, microarray analysis is quite sensitive to de-synchronization and experimental condition influence. also cell cycle process induced by different chemicals might harbor biases towards certain categories of cell cycle regulated genes. thus, our method could provide an alternative way to complement and verify known list of cell cycle regulated genes. after quantifying cell cycle genes by general model, we also applied phase specific model to further classify genes. phase specific prediction model is affected by the stage separation quality in cyclebase.org. for example, several genes are classified having some ambiguity, as their expression peak lying in the conjunction of two stages. however, it could provide clues to stage specificity of genes and is easy to adapt to other predefined data.

wu and li proposed a simple method to predict cell cycle genes based on chip-chip, tf binding sites and other data  <cit> . they predicted  <dig> novel yeast cell cycles genes that were regulated by at least two of  <dig> cell cycle tfs. here we applied a supervised statistical model to improve their method. out of the  <dig> cell cycle genes predicted by wu et al.,  <dig> are in our positive training set. in the remaining  <dig> genes,  <dig> are also predicted to be cell cycle genes by our model . out of the  <dig> genes, 69%  have physical interactions with known cell cycle genes, and 31%  have at least one of the  <dig> supporting evidences , compared with 63%  and 40%  for the  <dig> cell cycle genes predicted by our model. go analysis indicates that the  <dig> genes were enriched in various metabolic processes , while the  <dig> genes we predicted are more involved in cell cycle related processes .

there are also certain drawbacks of our model.  different transcription factors or motifs are weighted the same in our model, without considering their position and orientation relative to the gene. this information may further influence the expression peak time of genes.  as we shown, different cell cycle stages possess intrinsic varied regulatory mechanisms, but the general model we used assumes all cell cycle regulated genes harbor common genomic features. thus the model could be further modified to accommodate both common features and stage specific features. our genomic-based method can also be modified and extended to predict genes in other periodical processes, such as human cell cycle process and circadian phenomenon, or generally to transcriptionally regulated processes, such as tissue-specific expression.

CONCLUSIONS
we model the cell cycle regulated genes using their genomic features , especially in the promoter regions. it suggests that cell division, to a large extent, is controlled by a relatively small number of master transcription factors. these master tfs form a self-regulatory circuit and then regulate downstream tfs and genes. genomic feature based method exempts us from the drawbacks of microarray and helps us to reveal the regulatory machinery. this concept can be applied to other organisms and transcriptionally regulated processes.
