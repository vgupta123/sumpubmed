BACKGROUND
social monogamy is the most common mating system in birds  <cit> . however, application of molecular tools revealed that most socially monogamous species engage in extra-pair  mating . rates of extra-pair paternity  are highly variable between species, ranging from none to almost all broods containing ep offspring  <cit> . the evolution of ep mating remains puzzling, largely because the generally proposed potential costs  and benefits  remain controversial  <cit> .

when explaining variation among closely related species and between populations of the same species, ep mating rates are hypothesized to be a result of evolutionarily plastic responses to contemporary ecological factors. for example, lower breeding synchrony could reduce alternative mating opportunities and depleted genetic variation could diminish the genetic benefits of pursuing ep mating  <cit> . however, phylogenetic constraints on ep mating are important, with over 50% of the interspecific variation being explained at the level of families or orders  <cit> , suggesting that contemporary ecological factors may  play a secondary role  <cit> . indeed, results of comparative studies may vary depending on whether phylogeny is taken into account . nonetheless, the relative importance of phylogenetic constraints on one hand and plasticity on the other in determining interspecific variation in epp rates remains largely unknown.

here we examine the evolutionary flexibility of epp rates by studying a member of a genus of birds that display an unusual mating system with extensive behavioral and morphological adaptations specialized for ep mating. australian fairy-wrens  are considered the least faithful socially monogamous birds since all three members of the genus for which paternity has been analyzed show exceptionally high rates of epp   <cit> . male fairy-wrens invest heavily in mating competition as is evident from behavior as well as morphology. before breeding, males molt into colorful breeding plumage  <cit>  and develop unusually large testes and cloacal protuberances , important for sperm competition  <cit> . moreover, males engage in frequent courtship of ep females starting months prior to breeding and continuing all through the breeding season. ep courtship involves males intruding onto nearby territories followed by ritualized display of their bright breeding plumage during which a flower petal may be presented to the visited female. territorial intrusions by extra-group males and petal displays have been described for eight of the nine australian malurus species  <cit> , and therefore high epp has generally been expected for all fairy-wrens .

in this study, we examine rate of epp in purple-crowned fairy-wrens . purple-crowned fairy-wrens are riparian specialists rarely seen more than  <dig> m from the watercourse  <cit> . year-round, groups vigorously defend a stretch of the stream that serves as their exclusive, all-purpose territory  <cit> . the cooperatively-breeding mating system of m. coronatus appears similar to other malurus  <cit> , but predictions of high rates of epp for the species  may be premature. although the species is less studied than most other fairy-wrens, extra-territorial display by males has never been observed and m. coronatus pairs coordinate song to form 'duets'  <cit> , a feature generally related to low rates of epp  <cit> . here, we aim to establish the relative importance of phylogenetic constraints and evolutionary plasticity in response to ecological factors and life history, as determinants of extra-pair mating in m. coronatus. we quantify epp rate and investigate male behavioral and morphological adaptations known to be important for ep advertisement and mating competition in other malurus species. additionally, we compare life-history and ecology of purple-crowned fairy-wrens with the other three species with known levels of epp . we consider attributes that have been hypothesized to affect costs and benefits of, and constraints on, ep mating ; in particular: social mating system  <cit>  including number of helpers  <cit> ; clutch size and nesting success  <cit> ; divorce and mortality rates  <cit> ; incidence of incestuous pairings  <cit> ; importance of paternal care  <cit> ; and breeding synchrony and density  <cit> .

RESULTS
extra-pair paternity
in sharp contrast to the malurus species studied so far , paternity analysis of  <dig> offspring from  <dig> nests in m. coronatus revealed very low levels of epp:  <dig> % of offspring  in  <dig> % of broods  resulted from extra-pair matings. these  <dig> ep offspring in  <dig> broods included  <dig> offspring sired by a subordinate male in  <dig> groups, thus corresponding to  <dig> extra-group offspring  in  <dig> broods . paternity analysis was based on  <dig> microsatellite loci  with a maternal exclusion probability of  <dig> % and a paternal exclusion probability of  <dig> % . microsatellite heterozygosity was high .

adaptations to extra-pair mating: morphology and behavior
in m. coronatus, we found none of the male morphological adaptations for ep mating that are characteristic of other members of the genus . m. coronatus has much smaller reproductive organs during breeding : their testes are on average 10% of the size of testes of other malurus  and cloacal protuberances  in breeding males  are on average about half of the cp size of other fairy-wrens . a subset of males captured when their female was fertile  had an average cp of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm <dig> , a peak still much smaller than average breeding cp size in other malurus . interestingly, m. lamberti and m. pulcherrimus appear to have rather small cloacal protuberances , although all other typical ep mating adaptations have been recorded . it would therefore be interesting to explore epp rates in these two species.

in addition, to the primary reproductive traits important for sperm competition, traits involved in behavioral sexual competition were also reduced in m. coronatus. the amount of body plumage which males molt seasonally into colored breeding plumage  is only 21–34% of other malurus . likewise, the striking male behavioral adaptations specific to ep mating in other fairy-wrens are absent: in over  <dig> hours of observations on fertile females, we never observed male m. coronatus engaging in extra-territorial intrusions, courtship displays or presentation of flower petals . in contrast, previous research showed that fertile m. cyaneus females were visited by up to  <dig> intruding males per 20-min observation period, with more than 25% of females visited by at least one intruder  <cit> .

comparing malurus life-history and ecology
we compared m. coronatus with three congeners that have high epp, concerning aspects of general breeding biology, life-history and ecology that have been proposed or shown to affect relative costs and benefits of and constraints on extra-pair mating . this comparison showed that social mating system, number of helpers, clutch size, breeding success, rates of divorce, adult mortality, and incestuous pairing, rates of paternal care, and peak breeding synchrony are all very similar .

all fairy-wrens are cooperative breeders, with subordinate birds assisting the dominant  pair with offspring provisioning . groups average  <dig>  birds  in m. coronatus, including male and female subordinate birds, with sex of subordinates being skewed towards males . this results in approximately the same number of males present per territory compared to m. cyaneus , and slightly more than in m. splendens  and m. melanocephalus .

clutch size was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  eggs per clutch on average  intermediate to other fairy-wrens . like other fairy-wrens, m. coronatus can raise more than one successful brood annually .

pair bonds in all malurus species are long-lasting for two reasons. first, divorce rates in malurus are relatively low . in our population, three of  <dig> surviving pairs from  <dig> april  <dig> and none of  <dig> pairs from  <dig> april  <dig> divorced . this is similar to other species: in m. cyaneus  <dig> % of  <dig> pairs surviving to one year later had divorced  <cit> , and in m. splendens,  <dig> pairs divorced in  <dig> pair-years   <cit> . second, mortality rates in malurus are generally low  <cit> . in our m. coronatus population on average 19% of dominant males and females did not survive until one year later  resulting in comparable to slightly higher survival rates than in other malurus species.

we observed nine incestuous pairings of  <dig> pairings with known pedigree . this is similar to the potential for inbreeding in m. cyaneus and m. splendens , where incestuous pairings occurred in  <dig> out of  <dig> pairings  and  <dig> out of  <dig> pairings  respectively.

nestling feeding rates are similar in m. coronatus compared to m. cyaneus, the only congener with data available for comparison . in m. coronatus, males in unassisted pairs have a provisioning rate of  <dig>  feeds/hour , which is intermediate between two measures from one population of m. cyaneus  was 36% lower than in m. cyaneus , the only congener available for this comparison. this is because breeding in m. coronatus could occur in any month. however, there were typically peaks in spring  and in the wet-season , so peak synchrony was almost identical in both species .

breeding density is determined by territory size and arrangement. territory size in m. coronatus  is intermediate to other fairy-wrens . however, in contrast to other fairy-wrens which have territories arranged in a mosaic , territories in m. coronatus are linearly arranged along the stream and have therefore fewer neighbours.

discussion
epp is a defining feature of the mating system of australian fairy-wrens , associated with striking behavioral and morphological adaptations. although high infidelity has been assumed to occur in all fairy-wrens , we here show a marked exception: m. coronatus' mating system rather approaches genetic monogamy, with epp rates being even lower than the average  <dig> % of broods observed in socially monogamous birds  <cit> . although levels of epp in malurus fluctuate between species as well as within species ; between years 33–63%  <cit>  of nests), all studied species show high levels of promiscuity, with even the lowest values of epp being far higher than that of m. coronatus .

contrary to all other fairy-wrens, m. coronatus males show reduced sexual signaling , in line with lower levels of epp  <cit> . moreover, while other malurus have some of the largest testes and cloacal protuberances known for birds  <cit> , m. coronatus has relatively small reproductive organs, suggestive of reduced sperm-competition  <cit> . in fact, their testes are well below the average 1% of body mass for songbirds  <cit>  and cloacal protuberances of breeding males are also smaller than expected for their body size  <cit> .

a phylogeny including  <dig> of  <dig> species in the malurus genus  <cit>  suggests that m. coronatus is derived from an ancestor with high epp and the adaptations to ep mating that characterize its sister species . thus, phylogenetic parsimony suggests that ep mating and the entire suite of adaptations were lost within a single speciation event .

comparing malurus life-history and ecology
hypotheses attempting to explain interspecific variation in epp usually consider differences in social mating system or contemporary ecology as important explanations that can affect potential benefits, costs and constraints of ep mating  <cit> . however, the radical loss of extreme levels of epp in m. coronatus is not associated with any marked differences in relevant life-history parameters.

clutch size could affect epp rates  <cit> , but average clutch size is very close to on average around  <dig> eggs in all species , including m. coronatus. similarly, differences in annual fecundity could affect rates of epp  <cit> , but all malurus species can annually raise more than one successful brood .

potential  benefits of epp and epp rates can be dramatically affected by differences in mating system and opportunity to express social mate choice . however, all fairy-wrens are socially monogamous with restricted opportunities for social mate choice since breeding vacancies arise rarely in these long-lived, year-round territorial species with low divorce rates . low rates of divorce and mortality in m. coronatus are associated with a low epp rate, consistent with the pattern found in comparative studies  <cit> . while divorce rates are consistently low in all malurus species, mortality rates are slightly lower in m. coronatus than in its sister species . however, mortality rates are in general very low in the  malurus species , and, in fact, much lower than would be predicted from their high epp rates  <cit> . thus, it seems unlikely that a relatively slight decrease in adult mortality was important for the near-disappearance of ep mating in m. coronatus.

ep mating can act as a mechanism to reduce the costs of incest and inbreeding  <cit> . philopatry increases the risk of incest and inbreeding in general, as it does in other fairy-wrens  <cit> . the frequency of incestuous pairings in purple-crowned fairy-wrens does not differ compared to the sister species , including m. splendens for which inbreeding avoidance has been proposed as one of the benefits of epp  <cit> . therefore, in combination with the fact that molecular genetic variability is rather high , opportunities for genetic benefits of ep mating seem as likely in m. coronatus as in other fairy-wrens.

some life-history attributes can constrain females in ep mating behavior. for example, the importance and extent of male care can affect rates of epp  <cit> . all fairy-wrens are cooperative breeders with, on average 1– <dig> subordinates  assisting the dominant  pair. in m. cyaneus, helpers liberate females from constraints on ep mating by compensating for the reduction in male care associated with ep behaviors  <cit> . likewise, in m. coronatus, parents can decrease their feeding rate of nestlings when subordinates are present . increased value of male care in m. coronatus compared to other malurus seems unlikely since nestling starvation is uncommon , and nestling feeding rates of males without helpers are similar in m. coronatus compared to m. cyaneus . in addition, male paternity-guarding behavior might limit epp  <cit> . however, mate guarding is no more intense in m. coronatus than in m. cyaneus , and in m. cyaneus male mate-guarding does not prevent ep mating by females  <cit> .

availability of suitable ep mating partners and hence ep mating opportunities might be reduced by asynchronous breeding  <cit>  and low density  <cit> . although m. coronatus breeds more irregularly and has a longer breeding season than other malurus species, peak synchrony in m. coronatus is similar to peak synchrony in m. cyaneus , its sister species that has the highest rates of epp reported in birds  <cit> . breeding density  at first appears similar. however, spatial arrangement of territories is different in purple-crowned fairy-wrens .

it is difficult to demonstrate causation for a single evolutionary event, but a possibility is that the riparian specialization of m. coronatus, resulting in a one-dimensional arrangement of territories, may constrain access to an adequate sample of ep mates. extra-pair offspring in m. cyaneus are generally sired by males within one or two territories . territory length in m. coronatus is intermediate between the other fairy-wrens and the number of males per territory is similar . therefore, if female purple-crowned fairy-wrens traveled similar distances in search of ep males, this linear arrangement implies that a female could choose from fewer potential sires. for example, for average group size and composition of m. coronatus and m. cyaneus , within a two-territory radius there would be  <dig>  males in  <dig> linearly arranged territories in m. coronatus, compared to  <dig>  males in  <dig> territories in a honeycomb arrangement in m. cyaneus . male advertisement would be subject to analogous constraints since male m. coronatus would have fewer females to display to within a similar flight distance. however, inter-specific evidence for breeding density effects remains poor  <cit> . moreover although extremely low breeding density will necessarily limit ep mating , it is not immediately obvious why a relatively reduced availability of ep mates should lead to virtual female fidelity and absence of male ep mating adaptations in m. coronatus. however, this hypothesis could be explored by examining whether differences in ep mate availability  explain some of the variation in malurus' rates of epp between study years, populations and species.

CONCLUSIONS
although ep mating can have a strong phylogenetic component  <cit> , our results show that remarkable differences in ep mating system and associated adaptations can occur among species with very similar life-histories. this pattern suggests that phylogenetic constraints do not necessarily limit rapid evolutionary modification of epp rate, and that ep mating and its adaptations can be evolutionary much more labile than is commonly assumed  <cit> . if inter-specific variation in ep-levels is commonly not related to descent, social mating system, or obvious contemporary ecological factors, this could well be one reason why general explanations for the evolution of epp have remained elusive  <cit> .
