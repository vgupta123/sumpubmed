BACKGROUND
cnidarians and fluorescent proteins have been interconnected since the discovery of green fluorescent protein  in the jellyfish aequorea  <cit> . today fluorescent proteins  are utilized in numerous biological processes and systems, while cnidarians have reemerged as a tool for comparative evolutionary developmental biology  <cit> . cnidarians are the sister taxa to bilaterians  and exhibit a diploblastic level of tissue organization consisting of an outer ectodermal layer and an internal endo-mesodermal layer  <cit> . anthozoan cnidarians  have a biphasic life cycle consisting of a swimming planula “larva” followed by a benthic adult polyp . from the time of first cleavage, anthozoan embryos exhibit animal-vegetal polarity, where the animal pole will be the future site of gastrulation and will go on to form the mouth . the uncleaved embryo is amenable to genetic tools such as transgenes  <cit> , gene-knockdown and mis-expression  <cit>  through microinjection . nematostella vectensis embryonic and larval/adult cell morphology have mainly been studied using electron microscopy  or classic labeling techniques such as in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry. while these traditional techniques have revealed many important aspects about the cell biology of these animals, they rely on fixed specimens and developmental processes must be inferred by imaging many embryos at specific time points of interest. imaging using probes fused to fluorescent proteins during developmental processes is a robust technique to visualize dynamic processes in living cells and multicellular structures, with minimal introduction of artifacts created by fixation techniques  <cit> . the use of probes fused to fluorescent proteins makes it feasible to follow development in real time over a high temporal resolution and can reduce the potential artifacts that may be associated with fixation techniques.figure  <dig> 
phylogenetic position and life-cycle of
nematostella vectensis
. a) cnidarians are one of four early-evolved animal phyla that have recently been placed as the sister taxa to bilaterians. . b) the biphasic life cycle of anthozoan cnidarians like nematostella vectensis begins with an early cleavage program that leads to a hollow blastula. at this stage, cells colored yellow mark the future site of gastrulation and where the mouth will eventually form . during invagination the endo-mesoderm is formed, resulting in a diploblastic animal. in the ectoderm  at the aboral pole of the planula larva a sensory structure called the apical organ  or apical tuft forms. once the animal undergoes metamorphosis, the animal possesses tentacles  used for feeding and can produce gametes for microinjection



actin and tubulin proteins are essential for a wide range of physiological functions in many organisms, including plants and multicellular animals  <cit> . actin is one of the most abundant proteins present within a cell, found throughout cell structures such as filopodia, lamellipodia, muscle fibrils, cell adhesion complexes, microvilli, and in the outer nuclear membrane. actin in the nuclear membrane is associated with the nucleoskeleton and is linked to the cytoskeleton via nesprins that are part of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton  complexes  <cit> . another abundant cytoskeletal protein is tubulin, which is present as microtubules in cilia, flagella, neuronal axons and in the mitotic spindle complex. in general both proteins play important roles during cell motility, intracellular transport, cell shape maintenance and mitosis  <cit> .

in principal, the broad role of actin and tubulin in a variety of biological processes make them interesting candidates for in vivo visualization studies  <cit> . however, the over-expression of these proteins fused to fluorescent proteins may disrupt the normal protein function due to the size of the added fluorescent protein  <cit>  and/or competition with endogenous proteins  <cit> . given these limitations, probes such as lifeact and end-binding <dig>  have been used for the visualization of f-actin and microtubules respectively in a number of different systems such as plants, fungi and vertebrate cells  <cit> .

lifeact is a  <dig> amino acid peptide, originally isolated from yeast, which binds with low affinity to filamentous actin , associating with a number of actin rich cell structures such as lamellipodia, cilia and flagella  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown in vivo that lifeact does not inhibit the normal function of actin or associated cellular processes  <cit> . end binding protein  <dig>  is a plus-end-tracking protein found to act as a regulator of nucleation as well as growth of microtubules, observed in catastrophes and rescue events  <cit>  and has been used to study microtubules dynamics  <cit> .

in the following study, we used targeted probes against f-actin , microtubules , the nucleus  in comparison to classical histological staining techniques to determine their versatility as structural markers for in vivo studies.

methods
plasmids
coding dna for lifeact-mturquoise <dig> was pcr-amplified from the plasmid plifeact-mturquoise <dig> n <dig>  which was a kind gift from joachim goedhart. the pcr product was then cloned in pspe3-mvenus using the gateway system  <cit> . we developed two additional constructs for comparative cellular markers of the nucleus and of tubulin dynamics. a gateway plasmid pspe3-tdtomato  containing nuclear localization signals  at the c-terminal of the fluorescent protein was utilized to identify the nucleus. a second construct was developed containing the coding region of a nematostella vectensis homologue of the end-binding  <dig>  gene  . the coding region was then sub-cloned into pspe3-mvenus, providing the fluorescent tag at the c-terminal of the protein, using the gateway system  <cit> . finally, a gateway plasmid pspe3-mvenus  was used to encode free unbound fp in the cell. each of the four constructs was linearized and sense rna was synthesized using the t <dig> megascript kit  as previously described  <cit> .

microinjections
mrna encoding the fusion protein of interest was injected into unfertilized eggs prior to fertilization as previously described  <cit>  with the mrna encoding lifeact-mturquoise <dig> alone and or together with either the mrna encoding tdtomato-nls or eb1-mvenus at the final concentration of 400 ng/μl. live embryos were visualized approximately three to four hours after injection, when the rna of the fp was translated into protein. embryos were kept at room temperature  for the first four hours of development, then transferred to an incubator set at 16°c. during imaging, embryos were at room temperature.

staining of fixed embryos
cleavage stage embryos were fixed approximately 3 h post fertilization at room temperature in fresh  <dig> % paraformaldehyde, hepes  <dig>  m , egta  <dig>  m , mgso <dig>  <dig>  m, dextrose  <dig>  m, triton x- <dig>  <dig> %, pbs 1× and distilled water for 1 hour at room temperature. fixed embryos were rinsed 5× in pbt . to visualize f-actin, embryos were incubated in bodipy-fl phallacidin  diluted 1: <dig> in pbt. nuclei were visualized by incubation in hoechst  diluted 1: <dig> in pbt. tubulin was visualized by incubation in anti-alpha tubulin  in 5% normal goat serum . after incubation of the primary alpha tubulin antibody, animals were washed with pbt  for ten minutes each wash. a secondary antibody  was used at 1: <dig> to allow for visualization. all incubations were conducted over night at 4°c. in experiments where all three probes were visualized, animals were first incubated with the tubulin antibody, washed and incubated with phallacidin, hoechst and alexa  <dig> at the same time. stained embryos were rinsed again in pbs  and then dehydrated into isopropanol gradient 50%, 75%, 90% and 100% and mounted in murray’s mounting media , for visualization.

electron microscopy  in nematostella vectensis
for scanning em, embryos or juvenile polyps were relaxed in  <dig> % mgcl <dig> before being pipetted directly onto a pre-wetted  <dig> um gttp filter  mounted in a swinnex filter holder . mgcl <dig> solution was then replaced with standard em fixative  and samples were fixed overnight at 4°c. fixative was removed with three washes in  <dig>  m cacodylate buffer  and samples were post-fixed for 1 h at 25°c in 2% osmium tetraoxide  and dehydrated through a graded ethanol series. filters were then dried in a samdri critical point dryer  following the manufacturer’s protocol. dried filters were mounted on stubs using carbon tape and stored under desiccant prior to imaging with a hitachi s-4800-i field-emission scanning electron microscope at the university of hawaii’s biological electron microscopy facility . for transmission em, samples were collected in  <dig>  ml sterile microcentrifuge tubes and were otherwise fixed as described above. following the ethanol dehydration series, samples were washed three times  in propylene oxide and infiltrated in a 50: <dig> mix of propylene oxide and lx- <dig> resin  overnight at 25°c, following the manufacturer’s protocol. polypropylene/resin mix was then replaced with a fresh sample of resin three times the following day  before samples were transferred to silicone molds and polymerized at 60°c for approximately 72 h. thin sections  were cut using a powertomexl ultramicrotome  and mounted on formvar-coated copper slot grids. for visualization, grids were counter-stained in 5% uranyl acetate and  <dig> % lead citrate using standard procedures and imaged on a hitachi ht <dig> .

RESULTS
cellular distribution of lifeact-mturquoise <dig>  eb1-mvenus, tdtomato-nls and mvenus in early cleavage embryos
to image early cleavage stage cellular dynamics in vivo, we co-injected different combinations of three chimeric constructs  . fluorescence from all three translated proteins was first detectable approximately 2– <dig> hours after fertilization. expression of lifeact-mturquoise <dig> is visible throughout the cytoplasm during early embryogenesis, but exhibits increased fluorescence at cell boundaries, consistent with the cortical f-actin . the cytoplasm also exhibits distinct dark areas that lack fluorescence, which are likely to be platelets of yolk abundantly present in early stage n. vectensis embryos. tdtomato-nls predominately localizes to nuclei apart from a narrow band at the nuclear edge that completely overlaps with nuclear lifeact-mturquoise <dig> . in a subset of cells, potentially at a different stage of cellular division,  lifeact-mturquoise <dig> is visible as a ring around the nucleus. these embryos were co-injected with eb1-mvenus, which localizes to both centrosomes and spindle fibers . the cells that exhibited increased levels of lifeact-mturquoise <dig> around the nucleus  have yet to completely form spindle fibers . in control samples  that were injected with lifeact-mturquoise <dig> and mvenus, cells exhibiting heighted nuclear mturquoise <dig> also have ubiquitously expressed mvenus . one common result that was observed with each cytoplasmic present fp, is the localization of fluorescence in and/or around the spindle fibers . it is our understanding that this signal, or faint localization, is a non-specific localization .figure  <dig> 
localization of lifeact-mturquoise <dig>  tdtomato-nls and eb1-mvenus in early cleavage embryos. a) messenger rna for three different fluorescent probes was injected in pairs into embryos of nematostella vectensis. b-d) in the same embryo lifeact-mturquoise <dig> is localized to cell boundaries and overlaps with tdtomato-nls around the nucleus. e-g) in dividing cells eb1-mvenus is clearly localized at mitotic spindle fibers and centrosomes. interestingly lifeact-mturquoise <dig>  exhibits a brighter fluorescent ring around the nucleus in a subset of cells  that start to form centrosomes adjacent to the nucleus . lifeact-mturquoise <dig> is also visible as striations corresponding to the location of spindle fibers labeled with eb1-mvenus . h-i) double expression of lifeact-mturquoise <dig> and mvenus in nematostella embryos shows high concentration of lifeact-mturquoise <dig> around the nucleus  compared to mvenus used as a control  . j-k) both lifeact-mturquoise <dig> and mvenus appear as striations with the same morphology as spindle fibers . l) quantification of fluorescent i3ntensity of lifeact-mturquoise <dig> and tdtomato-nls in nuclei of early cleavage stage embryos . m) quantification of fluorescent intensity of lifeact-mturquoise <dig> and untagged mvenus in nuclei of early cleavage stage embryos . see main text for a more detailed description. 



we quantified the fluorescence intensity throughout a cell  and found that lifeact-mturquoise <dig> fluorescence around the nucleus is significantly higher than the fluorescence in the cytoplasm , however the localization of fluorescence in the nucleoplasm is likely non-specific because it is also found in the control using mvenus . the quantification of tdtomato-nls in the same cell shows that signal is directly overlaps the expression of nuclear lifeact-mturquoise <dig> . quantification of nuclear fluorescence intensity in control embryos expressing lifeact_mtq <dig> and mvenus indicates that lifeact_mtq <dig> is enriched around the nuclear boundary, where mvenus exhibits little change along the same measurement .

during embryonic cleavage, a distinct accumulation of lifeact-mturquoise <dig> localizes to the nuclear boundary
during early development in nematostella vectensis, the embryo undergoes approximately eleven cleavage cycles to reach blastula stage  <cit> , which can be visualized in embryos injected with lifeact-mturquoise <dig> and eb1-mvenus .

to better characterize cellular dynamics of lifeact-mturquoise <dig> during a cleavage event, we concentrated on visualizing individual cells with sufficient zoom and time resolution . in this time series  we were able to observe several distinct phases of the n. vectensis cell cycle. figure 3a shows an image sequence of one typical cell prior to  and during division . at 2: <dig>  we first observe an accumulation of lifeact at the nuclear boundary and at the same time, centrosomes become visible as regions of increased cytoplasmic lifeact-mturquoise <dig> which form adjacent to the nucleus . as we previously stated, the non-specific labeling of spindle fibers and centrosomes appearing in fp injections, can be used to identify these structures. the accumulation of lifeact-mturquoise <dig> in a ring around the nucleus continues over a time course of about 4 minutes. after this phase , we observe a distinct deformation of the circular structure around the nucleus , which starts at the position of the presumptive centrosomes and often results in a donut shaped nucleus. . during this phase, we observe that the centrosomes move further away from the nucleus and that in the time course of about two minutes the nucleus disassembles, during which the nucleus elongates and a fibrous network of lifeact is visible .figure  <dig> 
lifeact-mturquoise <dig> localizes to the nuclear boundary and exhibits a ‘flash’ of lifeact during nuclear disassembly. a) time series of a living cell undergoing cell division. just prior to nuclear disassembly, accumulation of lifeact is apparent  and during prometaphase disappears with a ‘flash’ . see main text for a more detailed description of the full cleavage cycle. scale bar 10 μm. b) when the cell rounds up during metaphase-anaphase lifeact-mturquoise <dig> fluorescence appears to increase at the cell boundary through time . the average profiles perpendicular to the plasma membrane region going from the intracellular space  to the extracellular space  from the region depicted in a <dig>   are normalized to the peak value of the profile at a <dig> , show for this cell an increase of about  <dig>  fold. c) quantification of the lifeact fluorescence at the nuclear boundary from  <dig> - <dig>  min. the profiles show the averaged normalized fluorescence perpendicular to the nuclear boundary going from nucleoplasm  to the cytoplasm 



after complete disassembly, lifeact-mturquoise <dig> is visible as striations in the cytoplasm  as previously discussed in figure  <dig>  the cell gradually assumes a spherical shape during metaphase and anaphase , which is often associated with an increase in lifeact-mturqoise <dig> fluorescence at the plasma membrane , which is not observed in mvenus control injections . this phenomenon was observed in many cells and in different embryos over time . the quantified increase of lifeact-mturqoise <dig> fluorescence at the plasma membrane is shown in figure 3b, where peak normalized average profiles across the plasma membrane are shown for the region depicted in figure 3a, 10: <dig> . based on  <dig> cells from different embryos we find that this increase is variable with an average of  <dig>  fold and 95% confidence interval of  . the centrosomes move in opposite directions close to the plasma membrane ; at the same time, the cleavage furrow starts to form and becomes visible . the cells are fully cleaved within 2 minutes thereafter. the nuclei in the daughter cells are then reassembled and are fully visible again after about 8 minutes . a complete cleavage event, starting from the increase of nuclear lifeact-mturquoise <dig> to reappearance of the nuclear lifeact-mturquoise <dig> in the daughter cells takes approximately 32 minutes .

to further quantify the transient increase of the lifeact  near the nuclear boundary, we constructed a contour around the nuclear edge for each time point. the average intensity profile perpendicular to the nuclear boundary, normalized with respect to the nucleoplasm intensity was then calculated. the profiles from the cell shown in figure 3a reveal that lifeact-mturquoise <dig> undergoes an approximate two-fold increase in fluorescence that commences about 4 minutes before deformation and disassembly of the nucleus . based on  <dig> cells from  <dig> different embryos we found an average increase of  <dig>  fold, with 95% confidence interval of  . analysis of the time series suggests that the accumulation of lifeact-mturquoise <dig> localizes around the outer surface of the nucleus in a greater quantity that what is found in the nucleoplasm . throughout early development, virtually all cells exhibited a lifeact ‘flash’ if imaging was conducted at the correct time during division.

the ‘flash’ of lifeact at the nuclear boundary doubles in intensity with respect to background fluorescence in the nucleoplasm and is distinctly visible during a relatively short time window of approximately two minutes. to further validate and corroborate the results found with lifeact-mturqoise <dig> we used classical staining techniques in preserved embryos. similar to lifeact-mturquoise <dig> labeled embryos, phallacidin staining labels f-actin near the nuclear boundary . co-labeling with anti-tubulin reveals that it is in the cells in which centrosomes are beginning to form that the nuclear boundary exhibits f-actin staining . in these cells, centrosomes with tubulin containing spindle fibers are forming on either side of the nucleus  at a time when the dna of the nucleus is still compartmentalized . in cells where spindle fibers have formed, f-actin appears brightest along the cellular boundaries . these results corroborate the observations obtained from lifeact-mturqoise <dig> imaging, and suggest that the accumulation of lifeact-mturqoise <dig> at the nuclear boundary occurs prior to the onset of nucleus deformation and breakdown at prometapahase.figure  <dig>

lifeact-mturquoise <dig> a suitable marker for monitoring cell shapes in multicellular embryos
f-actin can be detected in microvilli, protrusions of the cellular membrane  <cit> . in n. vectensis, these structures can be visualized by scanning electron microscopy during early embryonic development . a similar structure is visible by confocal microscopy of early embryos labeled with the f-actin binding molecule, phallacidin . phallacidin labeled embryos during gastrulation highlight the separation of ectodermal and endodermal tissue  and distinguishes cell boundaries along the ectodermal surface . during early embryogenesis, lifeact-mturquoise <dig> localizes to microvilli along the cell surface, and highlights cellular boundaries providing a three dimensional shape when confocal images are stacked from images taken along the z-axis . during early development lifeact-mturquoise <dig> can be used to visualize microvillar actin bundles along the cellular surface, which exhibit erratic swirling behavior along the cellular boundary . immediately prior to cleavage events, we found that embryos become more spherical in shape up to the point of cleavage at which the cells lose their round shape and appear to increase adjacent cell-cell contact . embryos in figure 5f-g or h- i were taken from a time series of cleavage events, from very early development . embryos in f and h were taken after embryos that had recently divided, while g and i are what the embryo looks like before undergoing division. generally, prior to division, the embryo as a whole exhibits a more compact or round shape with increased surface contact between neighboring cells than earlier stages with roughly equal numbers of cells . although cell counts were not performed, during this phase of development, it has been reported that cell division occurs in a highly synchronous fashion  <cit> .figure  <dig>

we found that lifeact-mturquoise <dig> allows for visualization of cellular shape changes in multicellular embryos through the visualization of the f-actin enriched microvilli and at the cell-cell interfaces during embryogenesis. we were able to clearly visualize cellular boundaries during cleavage stages and gastrulation , where the endodermal plate  moved inside the blastopore . figure 5m shows an early stage embryo that forms a compacted ball from a loosely packed cluster of cells over a time course of about 12 minutes. . the cells appear to increase cell surface contact and are pulled into the ball, similar to a process where cell-cell adhesion increases. these data show that lifeact-mturquoise <dig> can be used as a cell surface and boundary marker to follow developmental processes.

lifeact reveals a broad range of adult nematostella vectensis specific cell-types and cell-structures
f-actin is a core component of a variety of different cellular structures and therefore is broadly distributed throughout an animal. we used the adult polyp stage , which exhibits many differentiated cell-types, to determine what structures are enriched with f-actin and can be reliably visualized in vivo using lifeact-mturquoise <dig> figure  <dig> 
lifeact-mturquoise <dig> protein can be used to identify many different structures in adult
nematostella vectensis

the outer surface of the polyp is covered with ciliated cells, including the oral region  and these cells contain microtubule fibers detectable with tubulin antibody staining . a closer look at the structure of the cilia reveals that each long cilium is surrounded by a ring of microvilli  forming a ciliary cone structure. a transmission electron micrograph through a single cilium reveals the dense structure of the cilium, containing two microtubule fibers at the center and nine surrounding doublets that originate from the centriole; the cilium is surrounded by nine microvilli . an adult injected with lifeact-mturquoise <dig> reveals that lifeact is enriched at surface microvilli and distinctly at ciliated cells that exhibit a pattern associated with the nine microvilli that accompany each cilium , similar to figure 6d-e.

the muscular system  as well as cell boundaries  are rich with f-actin and can be visualized using phallacidin. as an adult, animals move through ciliary action and peristaltic movements . these movements are a result of muscular contraction and are accompanied by an increase in lifeact-mturquoise <dig> fluorescence around the region of constriction . similar to phallacidin stained animals, the cell boundaries are clearly visible in animals injected with lifeact-mturquoise <dig> .

cnidocytes are a cnidarian specific cell-type, and are thought to be derived from neural stem cells  <cit> . a transmission electron micrograph through a cnidocyte at the ectodermal surface shows filamentous structures reminiscent of f-actin around the apex of the unfired cnidocyte capsule . an adult, that was injected with lifeact-mturquoise <dig> as an embryo, reveals that lifeact also exhibits polarized fluorescence at the apex of the cnidocyte  confirming these regions are enriched with f-actin.

fluorescent properties of mturquoise <dig> allow for long exposure in vivo visualization with minimal toxicity
the fluorescent protein mturquoise <dig> exhibits one of the highest quantum yields and is relatively photo-stable making it bright and resistant to photo-bleaching  <cit> . to determine the versatility of this fluorescent protein as a structural marker during development , we took z-stack time-lapse images for six hours, at six different focal planes and for every ten minutes . a total of  <dig> scans per embryo  were obtained to determine to what extent long-term visualization would have an effect on normal development of the animal . all animals were kept after each imaging session and developed to the polyp stage . overall, long-term exposure analysis of lifeact-mturquoise <dig> during embryonic development did not appear to result in noticeable developmental defects. lifeact imaged embryos did not appear to lose fluorescent intensity over the long visualization period, where visualization of tdtomato or mvenus exhibited rapid bleaching over time . lifeact was still visible two months after injection of lifeact-mtq <dig> mrna into uncleaved eggs, long into the juvenile phase. summarizing, and maintains a similar cellular localization as in early juveniles . mturquoise <dig> is an excellent fluorescent protein for imaging embryogenesis, allowing rapid and dynamic cellular processes  to be captured, while at the same time enabling long imaging sessions, with low photo-bleaching and limited photo toxicity.

discussion
in this study, we used transient expression of lifeact-mturquoise <dig> in conjunction with other fluorescent probes and cellular markers for the visualization of developmental phenomenon of the cnidarian nematostella vectensis. these methods allow for imaging of cellular boundaries, microtubule dynamics and individual cell-type identification during development. the use of fluorescent probes such as the lifeact- mturquoise <dig> and eb1-mvenus used here enhances in vivo research of biological processes and can aid in phenotypic studies of gene knock-down. more specifically dynamic aspects of cell cleavage, early gastrulation as well as wound healing could be studied in much more detail.

mturquoise <dig> tagged probes, a bright way to follow development in nematostella vectensis
during early stages of development in n. vectensis, yolk is present throughout the cytoplasm, which limits imaging of fluorescent proteins deep into the embryo. high laser power can be used to obtain sufficient signal but this also leads to increased photo-bleaching. we observe that fusion of probes to mturquoise <dig> indeed allowed for imaging , with little photo-bleaching  and without any detectable photo-toxicity. we attempted similar long-exposure studies with tdtomato-nls and eb1-mvenus but bleaching of the fluorescence protein limited the length of time over which data could be collected . this study has shown that mturquoise <dig> greatly improves live imaging in nematostella vectensis.

visualization of f-actin and tubulin dynamics during nematostella vectensis cell division
by using a combination of lifeact and eb <dig> we were able to observe cleavage events in real time. it is our current hypothesis that the process of cell division in nematostella vectensis occurs through open mitosis, also found in many bilaterian taxa  <cit> . during open mitosis, the nuclear envelope breaks down, releasing the dna for segregation into daughter cells. prior to spindle fibre formation in nematostella, the nuclear outer surface, comparable with the nuclear envelope , expresses detectable levels of f-actin labeled with lifeact-mturquoise <dig>  while the centrosomes form and position themselves adjacent to the nucleus a distinct and robust f-actin “flash” occurs and then the presumptive ne begins to deform and break down. when the spindle fibres connect between the two asters, the nuclear boundary is no longer visible by lifeact-mturquoise <dig> or phallacidin, suggesting it has been dissembled. as the two daughter cells form, f-actin is localized to the cell boundaries of each cell and f-actin returns to the nuclear boundary after the two cells separate.

lifeact-mturqoise <dig> as well as the untagged mvenus used as a control appears to be associated with the cytoplasmic position of centrosomes and mitotic spindles, however this phenomenon was not observed when using phallacidin. although the levels of free cytosolic lifeact-mtq <dig> and/or untagged mvenus are expected to be uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm, one potential explanation could be that the presence of yolk platelets reduces the effective volume for proteins. this effect will occur both for transparent and opaque yolk particles. when formation of tubulin fibres locally pushes yolk platelets away the effective volume that is accessible for fluorescent probes increases, and hence locally increases fluorescence that comes from free lifeact-mturqoise <dig> or free fp .

compartmentalized f-actin along the nuclear boundary is not always clearly detectable by actin staining using common fixation methods. with the methods developed here, the rapid accumulation of f-actin prior to nuclear disassembly could be clearly and robustly observed. to date, this phenomena has been described in the sand dollar   <cit>  and polychaete worms  embryos, where it has been proposed that actin plays a role in accelerating nuclear envelope breakdown to facilitate faster cell cleavage  <cit> . the presence of ne breakdown in higher organism is still matter of debate, and is thought to have evolved as an extreme strategy to solve the problem of an increasing genome size, which is reflected by chromosome dimensions and number  <cit> . semi-closed mitosis in which the ne remains almost intact has been observed in bilateria such as caernorhabditis elegans and drosophila melanogaster which have genome size of respectively  <dig> and 180 mb  <cit> , considerably smaller than n. vectensis   <cit> . if open mitosis is a result of chromosomal dimension and genome size, then our observations using n. vectensis may support this hypothesis.

lifeact-mturquoise <dig> a marker for cell morphology and specific cell types during development
beyond the advantages of using lifeact-mturquoise <dig> to study in vivo cell cleavage in embryos, this technique also allows for visualization of f-actin throughout all stages of development. we observed f-actin in specific cellular structures such as microvilli, cnidocytes, ciliary cones in ciliated cells, and the plasma membrane. furthermore, lifeact-mturqoise <dig> allows for observation of real-time cell boundary dynamics and muscular contractions during animal movements in the adult polyps. having the ability to trace cells in vivo will help validate modeling studies of cell mechanics  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
methods developed in this manuscript provide an in vivo technique to follow cell cleavage during embryogenesis in nematostella vectensis. the fluorescent probe, lifeact-mturquoise <dig>  utilized in this manuscript provide a means to visualize specific cell types and structures that contain f-actin during development. one striking observation present during cellular cleavage was a ‘flash’ of lifeact prior to nuclear disassembly. the presence of nuclear disassembly suggests that cell division in nematostella vectensis goes through open mitosis, similar to many bilaterian taxa. the techniques developed in this study make nematostella a more attractive model system for comparative developmental and cellular biology.
