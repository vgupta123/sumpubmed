BACKGROUND
the genus brassica includes some of the most economically important crops with wide-ranging adaptability for cultivation under various agro-climatic conditions. among these are six widely cultivated species, including three monogenomic diploids: b. rapa , b. nigra , b. oleracea ; and three amphidiploids : b. juncea , b. napus  and b. carinata , which evolved through hybridization between different monogenomic diploids as described by u’s triangle  <cit> . among those cultivated species, b. oleracea exhibits the largest genetic and morphological diversity  <cit> , encompassing many common vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprout, kale, kohlrabi, and kai-lan.

in recent years, development of massive sequencing technology has led to new possibilities for high-throughput genome analysis  <cit> . transcriptome sequencing has become an attractive approach compared to whole-genome sequencing because it allows efforts to be targeted to genic regions  <cit> . the advent of transcriptome sequencing has yielded a huge amount of transcribed sequence data, such as expressed sequence tags  that can be exploited for gene expression profiling, genome annotation, comparative genomics and physical mapping. ests offer a simple strategy to study the transcribed portions of genomes and provide a robust sequence resource from which to develop functional markers  <cit> .

among next-generation sequencing  technologies, the  <dig> sequencing platform has been successfully employed for de novo transcriptome sequencing of many plant species, including american ginseng   <cit> , a. thaliana <cit> , maize   <cit>  and olive   <cit> . a single-plate run on the  <dig> gs-flx titanium platform typically produces around million reads with an average length of 400 bp, and is faster and cheaper than traditional sanger sequencing methods  <cit> .

molecular dna markers have greatly contributed to the development of plant genetics and breeding studies. the use of dna markers has become essential for crop improvement programs, such as for cultivar identification, genetic diversity, linkage map construction and identification of quantitative trait loci   <cit> . among the many types of dna markers, simple sequence repeats  and single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the preferred marker types for many genetic applications. ssrs are efficient co-dominant anchor markers with high levels of polymorphism and can easily be amplified by polymerase chain reaction  using primers designed from flanking sequences of the ssr motifs. meanwhile, snps are abundant in virtually all populations, with the majority being biallelic, and can be tightly linked to or are the actual cause of allelic  differences in traits  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> different genetic linkage maps of b. oleracea have been published so far  <cit> . however, most of those maps were developed using rflp markers, which could not be easily transferred to other genetic maps. in addition, only a few functional markers have been mapped in b. oleracea. the latest cabbage genetic map constructed by wang et al.  <cit>  contained  <dig> est-ssr markers. however, publicly available est-based ssr and est-based dcaps markers are still limited in this plant species. hence, development of more functional markers is desirable in order to facilitate the mapping, tagging and identification of important trait loci.

to generate large-scale est data and to develop functional markers using ests, we performed large-scale transcriptome sequencing of two cabbage parental lines, c <dig> and c <dig>  which have been used as elite breeding lines for development of commercial f <dig> varieties by the joeun seed company in korea, using the  <dig> sequencing platform, roche gs flx titanium series. these newly developed est-based ssr and dcaps markers were mapped along with ssr markers and intron-based polymorphism  markers that were previously reported for brassica species. this genetic map will promote qtl mapping and breeding.

RESULTS
sequence assembly and functional annotation
we obtained  <dig>  and  <dig>  high quality  reads for the c <dig> and c <dig> cabbage parental lines, respectively. de novo assemblies generated  <dig>  unigenes including  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singlets for c <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes that contained  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singlets for c <dig>  in total,  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads of c <dig> and c <dig>  respectively, were assembled into contigs, accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all sequencing reads. the majority of these contigs were in the range of 501–600 bp, with an average size of 693 bp and 730 bp for the c <dig> and c <dig> lines, respectively .

prior to functional annotation, the singletons from both lines that were less than 200 bp in length were removed. the remaining  <dig>  and  <dig>  assembled unique transcripts found in cabbage lines c <dig> and c <dig>  respectively, were compared against the ncbi non-redundant  protein database using the blastx algorithm. of these,  <dig>   of the c <dig> unigenes and  <dig>   of the c <dig> unigenes had significant hits. among the transcripts with hits, more than 76% matched known functional genes in both lines.

to explore and summarize the functional categories of the unigenes, we used blast2go to obtain the gene ontology  terms for the representation of molecular function, cellular component and biological process. approximately  <dig>   and  <dig>   of c <dig> and c <dig> unigenes that had blast hits, respectively, could be assigned to one or more ontologies. the results corresponded to a wide diversity of functional categories in all levels of the gene ontology database. figure  <dig> shows the unigene distribution for three main categories under go level  <dig> 

nbs-encoding genes in the black rot-resistant line
most disease resistance r genes encode putative proteins containing nucleotide binding sites  and leucine-rich repeat  domains. nbs-lrr genes can be divided into the toll-interleukin- <dig> receptor  and coiled-coil  sub-families. plant nbs-lrr-encoding genes play an important role in the responses of plants to various pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and fungi. hence, the black rot-resistant line c <dig> was searched for nbs-encoding genes. a total of  <dig> ests related to the nbs-lrr domain were identified in the c <dig> line . among them,  <dig> were classified as tir-nbs-lrrs and  <dig> were categorized as cc-nbs-llrs. thus, we conclude that many of the nbs genes in b. oleracea belong to the tir-nbs-lrr type. further, we compared the abundance/expression profile of nbs genes between c <dig> and c <dig> lines based on the mapping read count. as expected, we found a higher number of mapping counts for nbs genes in the resistant line  when compared to the susceptible  line .

frequency and distribution of ssrs in cabbage ests
in the  <dig>  unigene set of c <dig>  a total of  <dig>  ssrs were identified from  <dig>  unique ests with an average of one ssr per  <dig> ests.  <dig> ests were found to have more than two ssrs and  <dig> contained compound formations . the compound formations comprised either more than one repeat motif or the same repeat motif interrupted by a short non-repetitive sequence.

trinucleotide repeats were the most abundant type , followed by dinucleotide repeats . the other repeat types, including tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide represented less than 2% of the ssrs identified . among trinucleotide repeats, the most plentiful was aag/aga/gaa , followed by the atc/tca/cat  and agg/gga/gag . the ag/ga motif  was the most common among the dinucleotide repeats, while at/ta  and ac/ca  motifs were much less frequent .

development of est-based ssr markers
from the  <dig>  ests containing ssrs, we designed a total of  <dig> est-based ssr markers. the remaining  <dig>  ests were excluded for ssr marker development due to short flanking sequence insufficient for primer design  or because they had identical sequences in both parents . the  <dig> est-based ssr markers were used for a parental polymorphism survey between lines c <dig> and c <dig>  successful amplification was obtained from  <dig> primer sets . polymorphism was identified from  <dig>  primer sets , and we used  <dig> ssr markers for further mapping after excluding those giving rise to unclear band patterns and dominant marker types . the majority of the primer pairs amplified a single polymorphic locus, except for boessr <dig>  which had two polymorphic loci.

the rate of successful amplification and polymorphism did not significantly vary with ssr motif length . on the other hand, the primers for ssrs of more than 20 bp showed a much rate of higher polymorphism  than those for ssrs of less than 18 bp  .

development of est-based dcaps markers
potential snps were detected by mapping c <dig> raw reads onto c <dig> contigs by clc mapping. a total of  <dig>  snps including  <dig> transitions and  <dig> transversions as well as  <dig> indels were identified . regarding transition type snps, the a/g type  was found to have slightly lower frequency than the c/t type . meanwhile, for transversion type snps, a/t  was the most common and a/c  was the least common. of the candidate snps,  <dig> were used for development of dcaps markers. among them,  <dig> markers successfully amplified product and  <dig> markers  showed polymorphism between the two parental lines . we subsequently used  <dig> of these dcaps markers for genotyping f <dig> populations.

construction of genetic linkage map
a total of  <dig> polymorphic marker loci, including  <dig> est-based ssr and  <dig> snp-based dcaps marker loci were used along with  <dig> previously reported markers to construct a genetic map. the linkage map represents  <dig> loci assigned to  <dig> linkage groups , in accord with the haploid number of cabbage chromosomes , and designated as c01-c <dig> . only seven markers  failed to be placed on the map. the linkage map created here covered  <dig> .88 cm with an average distance between neighboring loci of  <dig>  cm. among the mapped loci,  <dig> have previously been placed on brassica genetic maps  <cit> , and were used as anchoring markers for the reference map. however, we found that six anchor markers were mapped into different lgs in this study. markers bngms <dig>  boe <dig>  bosf <dig>  ol10-b <dig> were previously mapped to lg  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> , but mapped to c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  respectively, in this study. likewise, markers sa <dig> and cb <dig> were mapped to lg  <dig> previously  <cit>  but positioned on c <dig> and c <dig>  respectively, in this current study. the newly developed est-based markers were distributed across all nine lgs. lg c <dig> had the most mapped est-based ssr loci , whereas c <dig> and c <dig> had the least . meanwhile, the number of mapped loci for est-based dcaps markers ranged from  <dig> in c <dig> and c <dig> to  <dig> in c <dig>  overall, c <dig> was also the largest lg, including  <dig> loci and spanning  <dig>  cm. c <dig> contained the fewest mapped loci , although its map length  was longer than that of c <dig> , which comprised  <dig> mapped loci. the average distance between adjacent markers ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   .

*previously reported markers are from wang et al.  <cit> , mun et al.  <cit> , lowe et al.  <cit> , piquemal et al.  <cit> , radoev et al.  <cit> , cheng et al.  <cit> , uzunova and ecke  <cit> , burgess et al.  <cit> , suwabe et al.  <cit> , kim et al.  <cit> , long et al.  <cit> , louarn et al.  <cit>  and smith and king  <cit> .

we identified some large gaps throughout the lgs. twelve gaps with >20 cm between adjacent markers were identified in eight lgs . c <dig> and c <dig> were each found to have three gaps in their lgs. the largest gaps were detected in c <dig>  with  <dig>  cm between bodcaps <dig> and cb <dig>  this indicates that the marker loci were unevenly distributed in the nine lgs of the cabbage genetic map.

segregation distortion of polymorphic markers
segregation distortion is defined as the phenomenon that alleles at a locus deviate from the mendelian expectation  <cit> . the occurrences of segregation distortion have been observed in brassica species which showed a number of distorted markers mapped on the genetic map  <cit> . in this study, we assigned all but  <dig> of the  <dig> polymorphic markers to linkage groups. most of the mapped markers segregated with the expected 1:2: <dig> mendelian ratio in the f <dig> population. however,  <dig>  markers showed a segregation pattern distorted from this ratio . these distorted markers were clustered or scattered in all lgs except in c <dig>  the clusters of more than three distorted markers were designated segregation distortion regions . of the nine lgs, we were able to detect sdrs in six. the longest sdr was found in c <dig>  with  <dig> markers spanning about  <dig>  cm and covering  <dig> % of c <dig>  meanwhile, the shortest sdr spanned  <dig>  cm in c <dig>  with only  <dig> markers identified .

*previously reported markers were used from wang et al.  <cit> , mun et al.  <cit> , lowe et al.  <cit> , piquemal et al.  <cit> , cheng et al.  <cit> , uzunova and ecke  <cit> , varghese et al.  <cit> , cheng et al.  <cit> , burgess et al.  <cit> , suwabe et al.  <cit> , kim et al.  <cit> , choi et al.  <cit> , batley et al.  <cit> , long et al.  <cit> , iniguez-luy et al.  <cit> , kresovich et al.  <cit> , szewc-mcfadden et al.  <cit> , louarn et al.  <cit> , bell and ecker  <cit> , lagercrantz et al.  <cit> , sebastian et al.  <cit> , smith and king  <cit> , hri  and saito et al.  <cit> .

discussion
transcriptome sequencing, assembly and gene annotation
transcriptome sequencing has proven to be an important tool for gene discovery, allele mining and marker development. in this study, the  <dig> gs-flx platform was utilized due to its longer read length, which enables high-quality de novo assembly of the transcriptome without a characterized reference genome  <cit> . additionally, newbler v. <dig>  software, which is currently the most robust software for  <dig> transcriptome assembly  <cit> , was chosen for assembling the sequence reads. consequently, a vast quantity of potential unique ests were generated, representing a large fraction of the cabbage transcriptome, and were further used for development of ssr and snp markers. the quality of the sequence information obtained here was confirmed by the high percentage of unigenes matching to known proteins by blastx and the high rate of successful pcr amplifications.

in order to examine the potential functions represented in the cabbage transcriptome, blastx analyses were performed against ncbi non-redundant protein database. at first, we removed singletons shorter than 200 bp because the percentage of blast hits usually shows positive correlation with sequence length, as has been confirmed previously in sweet potato  <cit>  and celery  <cit> . the blastx results revealed that more than 76% of the cabbage transcripts had similarity to known unique proteins. in addition, a large proportion of transcripts  were assigned to a remarkable range of go categories , indicative of the diversity of genes represented by the cabbage transcriptome. of all assignments made in three categories, most mapped into the go terms of binding activity  and catalytic activity  under the molecular function category. our results for go term distribution are in agreement with previous studies in rubber tree and pea transcriptome sequencing  <cit> . further, we identified and analyzed nbs-encoding disease resistance genes. although  <dig> technologies have low sequencing depth, we estimated the nbs-lrr gene expression profiles based on read count. in general, the resistant line showed higher expression of nbs-lrr genes than did the susceptible line. these findings contribute to understanding the evolution of nbs-encoding genes in brassica species.

general features of est-ssrs in the cabbage genome
the large collection of est sequences generated in the present study facilitates the identification of ssrs by in silico mining, which requires relatively little time and has been applied in a variety of plant species  <cit> . approximately  <dig> % of the  <dig>  cabbage unigenes possessed at least one ssr, which is in accord with values reported for other species, ranging from ~ <dig> to ~16%  <cit> . the est-ssr frequency observed here was higher than previous reports for a. thaliana, maize, tomato, cotton, poplar, and flax  <cit> . however, it is important to note that values for ssr abundance and frequency among different plant ests significantly depend on the parameters used to detect ssrs, the size of the dataset, the database mining tools, and the est sequence redundancy  <cit> .

our investigation revealed that trinucleotide repeats are the most common repeat motif attributed to the fact that they can generate non-frame-shift mutations in the coding region  <cit> , and perhaps result in variation of amino acid residue number at the protein level  <cit> . earlier studies demonstrated that ag/ct and aag/ctt were the predominant di- and trinucleotide ssr motifs, respectively, in plant dicot ests  <cit> , which is similar to our observation. these findings suggest that ag and aag motifs can be considered common features of est-ssrs in dicot plants.

marker development and polymorphism level of est-based ssr markers
est-ssrs are known to have high level of transferability across taxa and could be useful as anchor markers for comparative mapping and evolutionary studies  <cit> . in present study, a new set of  <dig> est-based ssr markers was developed and  <dig> % of them yielded amplification products. the amplification rate observed here is slightly higher than that reported for sweet potato   <cit>  and tomato   <cit> , but lower than that for b. rapa   <cit> . the success rate for ssr amplification generally ranges between 60-90%, as previously reported for several crop plants  <cit> .

the est-based markers designed here showed low polymorphism, which reflects the fact that est-ssr markers have less polymorphism than genomic ssrs due to highly conserved dna sequences in genic regions  <cit> . another factor likely contributing to the low level of polymorphism is that the parental lines used in this study are elite breeding lines that have a close genetic relationship. even though est-based ssr markers exhibit relatively low polymorphism, they may be linked to candidate genes or a trait of interest  <cit> , and as such can be more valuable than anonymous markers. moreover, markers designed from compound formations exhibited the highest level of polymorphism. this could be due to compound formations containing more than one ssr motif, which could increase the probability of polymorphism. in addition, previous studies reported that the level of polymorphism of ssr markers is usually correlated with ssr length, as observed in pepper and rice  <cit> . likewise, in this study, higher polymorphism was also observed when est-ssr markers included more than 20 bp of ssr length.

validation and polymorphism analysis of est-based dcaps markers
a considerable number of snps were successfully identified and used to design dcaps markers. the dcaps method creates polymorphism from snps by restriction endonuclease digestion of the pcr products  <cit> . approximately  <dig> % of the amplified primers showed polymorphism between the two parental lines. the remaining 46% did not show any polymorphism that might be derived from sequencing errors or mis-alignment between paralogous genes of the triplicated brassica genome  <cit> . the polymorphism analysis obtained in this study was in accordance with a previous study in cabbage by wang et al.  <cit> , in which it was also observed that snp markers had higher polymorphism than ssr markers. the combination of ssr and snp markers designed here allowed a larger number of est-based markers to be mapped onto the cabbage genetic linkage map.

linkage map construction for cabbage
we effectively constructed a genetic linkage map for cabbage spanning a total  <dig> .88 cm, which is slightly larger than the earlier cabbage genetic map  generated by wang et al.  <cit> . the difference in length between these two maps could be contributed by the difference in the chromosomal recombination frequency caused by environmental factors and the genetic distance between mapping parents, and also the different size of the mapping population as well as the number and types of markers used for map construction  <cit> .

some of the mapped est-based marker loci were found to be clustered in narrow regions, e.g. c <dig> , co <dig>  and c <dig> . this clustering might correspond to the gene-rich regions of cabbage. clustered markers in genetic maps were also reported in soybean  <cit> , pepper  <cit> , and b. rapa <cit> , as well as a previous cabbage map  <cit> . in addition, we observed  <dig> gaps in total along this map that varied in size . these gaps were detected in all lgs except lg  <dig>  suggesting that such gaps are not restricted to a particular region of the chromosomes. the presence of these gaps may have negative effects on the application of mapped dna markers. as mentioned by cregan et al.  <cit> , genomic regions that lack dna markers will make detection of quantitative trait loci  difficult. therefore, we plan to develop more markers in the near future to fill in gaps between markers and achieve a high-density genetic linkage map. we also observed that six markers that we used as anchor markers were mapped to the different lgs than previously reported. this could be due to some of those markers producing multiple bands, which could lead to a band derived from a paralogous locus being mapped in our population. another possible explanation is due to genomic rearrangement which may be observed in genetically unstable population such as in f <dig> population that we used in this study. as also reported by wang et al.  <cit>  that f <dig> population are temporary and difficult to maintain for long term period.

segregation distortion phenomenon in the cabbage genetic map
segregation distortion is a common fact in segregated populations generated from crosses between diverse genotypes  <cit> . in plants, segregation distortion was first reported in maize  <cit> , and subsequently in many species including rice  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , and cabbage  <cit> . segregation distortion can have important implications for the construction of a genetic map and qtl mapping, but if addressed properly, distorted markers can also be helpful for qtl mapping  <cit> . many factors such as mapping population type, marker type, and genetic relationships of the parents are closely related to the extent of segregation distortion  <cit> .

a recent study identified  <dig> sdrs on seven lgs of a cabbage genetic map  <cit> . in the present study, we detected six sdrs located on six lgs, specifically c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig>  the difference in sdr numbers may be related to the different types of mapping population used for constructing the maps, since for the earlier map they used a double haploid  population, whereas in this study an f <dig> population between elite breeding lines was used. thus, this finding is in strong agreement with those of zhang et al.  <cit>  that segregation distortion is more frequent in dhs and rils than f <dig> populations. moreover, we found that the longest distorted regions were on c <dig>  this result reflects that the distorted markers were non-randomly distributed throughout the genome  <cit> . additionally, the fact that markers with segregation distortion are clustered in particular regions indicates that segregation distortion in the f <dig> population is most likely caused by genetic factors and unlikely to be due to statistical bias, genotyping or scoring errors  <cit> . the existence of sdrs suggests that there has been a selective process in gametophytes or sporophytes  <cit> . also, based on studies in other crops, sdr loci may be linked to sterility genes and pollen-suppressed genes that can affect the selection of partial gametophytes or sporophytes  <cit> . overall, the results represent an initial finding of segregation distortion in cabbage; therefore, further investigation is needed to understand better the mechanism underlying the segregation distortion phenomenon in the cabbage genetic map.

CONCLUSIONS
the  <dig> gs-flx platform has been established to be a powerful tool for de novo transcriptome sequencing due to its long read length. a large number of cabbage est sequences were generated and used as a reliable source for marker development and discovery of a new candidate disease resistance gene. subsequently, a novel set of  <dig> ssr and  <dig> dcaps markers were successfully developed and validated using two parental lines of cabbage. of these,  <dig> ssr and  <dig> dcaps markers revealed clear polymorphism between the two cabbage parental lines, and together with previously developed markers were used to construct a genetic linkage map for cabbage. the map generated herein will facilitate the identification of candidate qtl for economically important traits. in addition, these newly developed markers increase the publicly available est-based markers in cabbage, which readily can be utilized for other brassica species. this result demonstrates that transcriptome sequencing using the  <dig> gs-flx titanium sequencer can be a fast and efficient approach for gene discovery and marker development, especially for species without reference genome sequence.
