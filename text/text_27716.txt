BACKGROUND
the liver – one of most important organs in the human body – performs the main digestive function in the metabolism of most substances. in addition, liver has a number of other functions, including the generation of red blood cells during embryonic development, production of various plasma proteins, detoxification of xenobiotics and phagocytosis of solid materials. it forms a protective barrier between the digestive tract and the rest of the body. the liver also plays a vital role in activation, catabolism and excretion of retinols that are essential to the vision, growth, reproduction, immunity, cell proliferation and differentiation of the body. furthermore, as a major organ of drug elimination, the liver has a significant effect on drug metabolism. however, to date the molecular mechanisms of liver function have not been completely characterized.

massively parallel signature sequencing  as a global view with no bias towards the transcriptome of certain tissues or cells will provide a profound understanding of organ and cell functions  <cit> . it is well known that human liver is composed of many types of cells, such as hepatocytes, bile duct cells and kupffer cells, where hepatocytes account for three-quarters of the volume and perform the main functions of the liver. in this study, a powerful transcriptomic approach was employed to profile the gene expression of human hepatocytes obtained by laser capture micro dissection  for providing an available resource to address the molecular basis of hepatocyte biology.

RESULTS
identification of unigene clusters in hepatocytes by mpss
first, human hepatocytes were obtained from the ten samples using lcm. to eliminate the variation between individuals, we extracted the total rna from these individual samples and assessed by the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer, and then rnas were equally pooled. the pooled rna from the lcm samples was available for analysis in following steps. to further evaluate the quality of rna sample isolated from the hepatocytes, reverse transcription -pcr was employed to detect the expression of the hepatocyte-specific marker, albumin , and the bile duct cell-specific marker, cytoskeleton protein  <dig> . the resulting data showed that alb was significantly expressed in the hepatocytes , whereas ck <dig> was detected in liver but not in the hepatocytes , indicating that the hepatocytes captured by lcm were pure and appropriate for the transcriptomic analysis.

the pooled rna was then subjected to mpss analysis .  <dig>  distinct signatures that represent different transcripts were derived from a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequences in four sequencing runs. the sequencing runs were merged and the expression level of each signature was normalized to transcripts per million , essentially as previously described by meyers et al  <cit> . to annotate the signatures, the distinct signatures were searched against human unigene database  and the human genome sequences  by blast programs. similar to the annotation process developed by lynx, each signature was ranked based on its position and orientation within the transcript, the presence of a polyadenylation signal and polya tail in the transcript sequence . herein, the expression value  of each gene is the sum of all tpms of signatures matched to this gene. out of the  <dig>  signatures,  <dig> % and  <dig> % were detected in the range of 1– <dig> and 10– <dig> tpm, respectively. only  <dig> % of the signatures exhibited the high tpms over  <dig> , in which alb , known to be secreted by hepatocytes, showed the highest abundance. overall, the abundances of mpss signatures indicated that a large number of genes were expressed at lower levels in hepatocytes, whereas only a few genes were expressed at very high levels.

tpm:transcripts per million

to describe the detailed profiles of gene expression of hepatocytes,  <dig>  signatures from mpss data were first compared with unigene database. the resulting data indicated that  <dig>   signatures were uniquely matched with  <dig>  non-redundant unigene clusters, whereas  <dig>   signatures could not be defined as unique unigene clusters due to multiple hits with unigene dataset. the remaining  <dig>  signatures were then employed to be searched against a human genomic database.  <dig>   signatures were uniquely mapped onto specific genomic loci, whereas  <dig>   hit multiple genomic sequences . in addition,  <dig>   signatures matched with over  <dig> genome locations.  <dig>   signatures could not be matched to any known genomic sequences, possibly due to sequencing errors, spliced 3'-ends that have not yet been identified, and transcripts in regions of the genome not yet sequenced  <cit> . alternatively, the reasons why signatures may not match the genome may be that the signatures contain part of a poly tail, or polymorphisms between the individual analysed and the reference human genome sequence, or contamination with rna or dna from other species. also, the use of blast to match signatures to the genome may preclude the identification of single nucleotide mismatches between the sequence and the genome or transcriptome databases.

to evaluate whether those signatures with low abundance  were also reliably expressed in the hepatocytes, rt-pcr was employed to detect the transcripts of the  <dig> unigene clusters with less than  <dig> tpms, where the unigenes were randomly selected for the estimation. the interesting results showed that the transcripts of all unigene clusters examined were indeed detected in the human hepatocytes at different levels , suggested that transcripts detected at  <dig> tpms or less by mpss assay could in fact be proven to be expressed by rt-pcr.

taken together, the resulting data suggested that  <dig>  unigene clusters could be detected in human hepatocytes using mpss technique, implying that  <dig>  known genes represented by the mpss signatures could be expressed in the cell type of liver .

enriched genes in hepatocytes
to explore the enriched genes expressed in human hepatocytes, we compared the hepatocyte mpss dataset with datasets from another  <dig> tissues deposited in geo  <cit> . we clustered all genes with hierarchical clustering by using genespring software . the resulting data showed that there were many genes enriched in hepatocytes. to identify the enriched genes in hepatocytes, the following formula was used as previous description  <cit> :

here s is the enrichment, e <dig> to en are the expression levels across all tissues and eh is the expression value observed in hepatocytes for a given gene. s values >  <dig> would be considered as hepatocyte-enriched genes. the results indicated that  <dig> non-redundant unigene clusters were enriched in hepatocytes . many of these were well-known to be secreted by hepatocytes and enriched in the liver. for example, alb, apoa, apob, and apoc are related to lipid metabolism and maintaining the balance of proteins in plasma. interestingly, a number of genes with unknown functions, such as flj <dig> and mgc <dig>  were also enriched in hepatocytes. whether these genes are involved in hepatic functions should be further investigated. however, it should be pointed out that the distinct discrepancy of gene expression profiles between liver and other human tissues, based on hierarchical clustering of mpss data , might result partially from the technical difference between the data collected in this study and the reference dataset.

these  <dig> hepatocytes-enriched genes were mapped onto human chromosomes based on genomic information . some hepatocyte-enriched unigene clusters were mapped onto certain gene-rich regions, such as 8q <dig>  11p <dig> , 11q <dig> , 16p <dig> , 17q <dig>  and  <dig> . to further characterize the regulatory mechanisms of the genes enriched in hepatocytes, the most over-represented motifs of the promoters of these hepatocyte-enriched genes , as compared to that of those non-hepatocyte-enriched genes , were identified in silico by the motifclass program  <cit> . the top ten over-represented motifs included nr1h <dig>  smad, nerf1a, and hnf <dig>  where the corresponding sequence logo builds were derived from the position weight matrix  for the motifs . among them, hnf <dig> – one of the best experimentally known motifs in human liver – has been reported to play an important role in gene regulation networks in liver  <cit> . the data suggested that these cis-regulatory elements and their corresponding transcription factors might be crucial to the expression pattern of the hepatocyte-enriched genes.

antisense transcripts
natural antisense transcripts  have been identified from plants  <cit>  and animals  <cit> , and these antisense rnas are thought to be very important in the regulation of gene expression in such higher eukaryotes  <cit> . recently, approximately  <dig> unigene clusters of potential human nat pairs had been identified by several groups  <cit> . the synchronous presence of both sense and antisense transcripts in the same cells or tissues may be an important indicator of antisense regulation  <cit> . interestingly, among  <dig>  signatures uniquely matched with unigene clusters, we here identified  <dig>  unique signatures matching antisense strands according to the signature classification , according to the previous description by jongeneel et al  <cit> . herein, these antisense strands represented  <dig>  non-redundant cis-antisense transcripts in hepatocytes, of which  <dig>   of these antisense transcripts are co-expressed with their corresponding sense transcripts, whereas  <dig>  of these antisense transcripts were found to be expressed alone. compared with published nats,  <dig>  out of  <dig>  unigene clusters of the antisense transcripts were previously uncharacterized, implying that a large number of nats could be found in given cells or tissues by the powerful transcriptomic approach.

to further characterize the functional features of those genes with antisense transcripts expressed in human hepatocytes, these genes were assigned into go functional categories. the majority of these genes were classified into the categories of basic metabolism, cell growth and/or maintenance, and cell communication, whereas a few genes were associated with liver development, morphogenesis, cell differentiation, and cell death . to define whether a go category is really over- or under-represented in genes with antisense transcripts, we here performed the fatigo+ classification, a web-based tool for the functional profiling of go categories, through comparing the subcategories for genes with or without detectable antisense transcripts. interestingly, the resulting data suggested that some go subcategories related to molecular functions, such as the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, arylamine n-acetyltransferase, map kinase kinase kinase and chemokine receptor, were significantly over-represented in genes with antisense transcripts , whereas the category associated with atpase activity were under-represented in genes with antisense transcripts  , suggesting that nats could be involved in the regulation of hepatocyte functions. both sense and antisense transcripts of some genes that are related to liver function were found to be co-expressed in hepatocytes. for example, some apolipoproteins , including apoc <dig>  apoc <dig>  apob and apoh that constitute the essential structural proteins of certain lipoproteins involved in lipid transport, were found to exhibit both sense and antisense transcripts co-expressed in hepatocytes. to confirm the existence of the antisense transcripts, specific primers against these genes were designed for rt-pcr , where two genes, tmem <dig> and lass <dig>  without antisense counterparts detected by mpss, were randomly selected as negative control in the rt-pcr approach. the rt-pcr data showed that the antisense transcripts of apoc <dig>  apoc <dig>  apob and apoh are indeed co-expressed with their corresponding sense transcripts in hepatocytes , whereas the antisense counterparts of tmem <dig> and lass <dig> were not detected, although the sense transcripts of these two genes were expressed , which was in consistence with the mpss data. these interesting results, that the antisense transcripts of some genes were in fact co-expressed with the sense ones, suggested that the post-transcriptional regulation at mrna level of some genes could be an important event through degenerating the sense rnas or editing the mrna for generating different splicing  <cit> .

to further characterize the antisense transcripts' tissue enrichment, the nats data from the hepatocytes was compared with that of published mpss data from another  <dig> tissues  <cit> . here, nats were considered as tissue-enrichment where the s_value was >  <dig>  many nats exhibited significant tissue-enriched expression patterns  , suggesting that the expression of these nats could be strictly regulated in a given tissue. among  <dig> potential hepatocyte-enriched nats , some antisense transcripts may be involved in pentose and glucuronate interconversions , fatty acid metabolism , bile acid biosynthesis , urea cycle , and arachidonic acid metabolism .

to explore the genetic mechanisms involved in the regulation of these nats, all nats were mapped onto the genomic loci in order to investigate the genomic features of their corresponding sense transcripts. among  <dig>  nats,  <dig>  nats were uniquely mapped onto genomic loci, where  <dig>  were matched onto the exons of the corresponding genes, including  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  assigned onto 5'-utr, 3'-utr, and protein-encoding regions, respectively, according to the structures of mrnas derived from these genes . furthermore, additional  <dig>  and  <dig>  nats were localized onto the promoters and intronic regions of genes, respectively, implying that the regulatory mechanisms of transcriptional expression involving antisense rnas are very complex, although the possibility that these nats are polyadneylated in the opposite direction of the sense strand transcripts does not exclude. interestingly, of  <dig> nats matched to the promoters,  <dig> could be transcribed from the cpg island-enriched promoters . recently, some groups have reported that the association of antisense rna transcripts with cpg methylation can lead to human genetic diseases  <cit> . whether these nats in hepatocytes could regulate the transcriptional efficiency of sense transcripts through the dna methylation of the promoters should be further investigated.

to evaluate the evolutional conservation of these nats, we identified their ortholog pairs between human and mouse through the reciprocal best matches between both genomes.  <dig>  out of  <dig>  human nats were considered to have the corresponding antisense orthologs from mouse through comparing the data from the homologene database with mouse genome informatics, suggesting that some nats could be evolutionarily conservative. furthermore, these human nats derived from hepatocytes were compared with  <dig>  mouse nats from the liver based on mpss signatures deposited in ncbi geo . the resulting data showed that  <dig> nats, including  <dig> with both sense and antisense transcripts, were commonly expressed in human and mouse livers . for example, the nats of these genes, such as cyp4a <dig>  hadh <dig>  hsd17b <dig> and acox <dig> involved in fatty acid metabolism, cyp27a <dig> and acadsb in bile acid biosynthesis, and adh <dig> in alcohol metabolism, were conserved in both human and mouse livers, suggesting that these conservatively co-expressed sense-antisense pairs could play important roles in hepatic functions.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provided a comprehensively transcriptomic atlas of human hepatocytes using mpss technique, which could be served as an available resource for an in-depth understanding of human liver biology and diseases. in addition, the data suggested that, like a large number of protein-coding genes, some antisense transcripts expressed in hepatocytes could play important roles in transcriptional interference via cis-/trans-regulation mechanisms.
