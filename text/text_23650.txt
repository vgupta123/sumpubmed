BACKGROUND
direct microinjection of foreign dna into the pronucleus of fertilised zygotes is a conventional method to generate transgenic animals, whereas the exact integration site and the number of copies of the transgene are random and unpredictable  <cit> . previous studies involving animal transgenesis indicate that the linear dna molecules injected into the pronucleus undergo rapid circularisation followed by random linearisation and concatemer formation by homologous recombination before integration into the host genome  <cit> . it was thought that the foreign dna concatemers would be finally inserted into the host dna randomly through imperfect sequence recognition via heterologous recombination followed by cellular dna repair activity  <cit> . until now, it was not clear how foreign dna molecules insert into the host genome. a few studies have unravelled some of the mystery of random integration and indicated that the integration site of foreign dna is not totally random  <cit> . more detailed analyses of the integration sites revealed some interesting trends. for instance, a review of  <dig> different insertion mutants generated in transgenic mouse lines revealed that some chromosomes, such as chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  are selected more often for illegitimate integration than others  <cit> . intrinsic dna structures such as bent dna elements could be a major determinant in chromosomal illegitimate recombination because their structure can provide a preferential donor site for the integration  <cit> . in addition, short identical sequences of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides have been found at the genome-transgene junctions  <cit> . these integration sites are usually associated with the consensus sequence for topoisomerase-i cleavage sites  <cit> .

recently, we have successfully used standard pronuclear microinjection to produce transgenic mice integrated with the fad <dig> gene from the cotton plant, encoding fatty acid desaturase- <dig>  those transgenic mice were used to study the role of fad <dig> in the conversion of oleic acid to linoleic acid. in the present study, using the transgene inheritance pattern of f <dig> progeny, we showed that one of the transgenic lines had only one integration site on the x chromosome. thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr   <cit>  was used to identify the transgene-chromosome junction in mice previously  <cit> . to investigate the exact insertion site on the x chromosome, this method was also employed to map the 3' chromosomal boundaries of the integration site in fad <dig> mice. we successfully defined the 3' integration site by tail-pcr and the 5' integration site by conventional pcr. based on the sequence data of both junctions, the mechanism of the homologous illegitimate random integration of the foreign dna in transgenic animals was also analysed. finally, the transcription characteristics of the x-linked fad <dig> were investigated further.

RESULTS
analysis of transgene inheritance
pcr  and southern blotting analysis  demonstrated that a male mouse  integrated the foreign gene. pcr analysis of its f <dig> offspring produced by seven c <dig> females showed that all  <dig> heterogeneous males were nontransgenic, whereas all  <dig> heterogeneous females were transgenic . the results indicated that the fad <dig> transgene integrated into the x chromosome.

identity of the 3' integration site
to determine the integration site of the foreign dna on the x chromosome, tail-pcr was used to define the 3' chromosomal boundaries of the transgene . each pcr fragment, amplified by the tertiary cycling from the samples of three mouse- <dig> progeny, was purified and sequenced directly . sequencing and blast search results in the mus musculus  genome showed that the mouse- <dig> fragments were derived from the transgene itself, whereas pcr products of mouse- <dig> and mouse- <dig> contained both the foreign dna and the x flanking sequences . homology analysis indicated that the foreign gene was integrated into the xc <dig> region and that the junction site was located at base  <dig> , <dig> 

junction sequence analysis also showed that there was an additional 29-bp fragment  between the 3' end of the transgene and the x flanking sequence. this 29-bp sequence was 100% identical to the initial 5'-end of the foreign dna in which the last seven nucleotides  were also shared by the x chromosome sequence. additional pcr amplification using the specific primers that spanned the above junction sequence confirmed that the 3' integration site  was successfully mapped. these results suggest that the transgene integration was mediated by the seven common nucleotides.

identity of heterozygotes
genotypes were determined by pcr amplification using transgene-specific  and genome-specific primer  sets concurrently. as shown in figure  <dig>  amplification of the heterozygous transgenic dna in the x+x female sample resulted in two bands,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp. c <dig> dna yielded only a single 495-bp band, and homozygous transgenic dna in the x+x+ female or the x+y male yielded only a 567-bp band.

identity of the 5' integration site
based on the 3' integration site at  <dig> , <dig>  several primer sets corresponding to its known upstream sequence  were designed to map the 5' integration position. among them, the results of three amplifications are shown in figure  <dig>  p <dig> primers, corresponding to the - <dig>  to - <dig>  region, successfully amplified the 205-bp fragment in all of the x+x+, x+x, x+y and c <dig> samples. p <dig> and p <dig> primers, corresponding to regions - <dig>  to - <dig>  and - <dig>  to - <dig> , respectively, only amplified the 320-bp and 419-bp fragments, respectively, in x+x and c <dig>  but not in the x+x+ or x+y samples . these results indicate that the 5'-integration site was within the - <dig>   <dig> to - <dig>  region.

further pcr analysis was performed using several additional primer sets consisting of the forward primers, corresponding to x loci from - <dig>   <dig> to - <dig> , and the common reverse primer, corresponding to the cmv enhancer sequence included in the transgene construct. among them, results of two amplifications are shown in figure  <dig>  p <dig>  from - <dig> , or p <dig>  from - <dig> , successfully produced the 1732-bp and 799-bp bands, respectively, in all fad <dig> samples, but not in the c <dig> samples. sequencing and homology analysis of two fragments showed that the resulting sequence could be divided into three parts. the 3'-end sequence was 100% identical to the initial sequence of the transgenic molecules. the middle sequence, including  <dig> nucleotides , showed 100% identity with the transgenic complementary sequence from  <dig> to  <dig> that linked the 3'-end sequence with five additional nucleotides. the 5'-end sequence was 100% identical to the xc <dig> upstream sequence at position  <dig> , <dig>  in which three common nucleotides from - <dig> to - <dig>  were shared by the transgene and the x chromosome .

based on the 5' and 3' junction mapping results, we concluded that the entire  <dig> -bp genomic region  was successful replaced by the foreign dna molecules during the process of random integration . for each junction, a very short homologous arm  in the at-rich domain presumably mediated the recombination of the transgene and the host genome .

transcription analysis
pcr and sequencing analysis using primer pairs spanning the 5' and 3' transgenic sequences showed multiple copies of the transgene inserted into the same site of chromosome x . to assess the transcriptional potential of fad <dig>  total rna from liver, kidney, brain, muscle, and heart tissues was analysed by rt-pcr. as shown in figure  <dig>  the amplification results from five primer sets corresponding to different regions revealed that no transcriptional signals were detected in the upstream region  of the 5' integration site or the distal downstream region  of the 3' integration site in the c <dig> samples, while fad <dig> was expressed in all of the transgenic tissues . in addition, the transcriptional signals of the 3' flanking sequences in the fad <dig> mice, which extended at least  <dig> but no more than  <dig> nucleotides past the 3' integration site, were detected by rt-pcr .

transcription level of the x-linked transgene
to gauge the transcription level of the x-linked fad <dig> in females, we measured the expression of the foreign gene. kidney, brain, and liver tissues from the x+x+, x+x, c <dig> females, or x+y males were analysed concurrently for reference. the real-time rt-pcr analysis showed that the foreign gene was expressed in all transgenic samples from the fad <dig> females or males and that the transcription level in the x+x+ females or x+y males was about twice as high as in the x+x females . the results suggest that the foreign fad <dig> behaved like an x-linked gene.

discussion
approximately 5-10% of the random dna insertion events in transgenic animals are associated with recessive mutations or viable phenotypic alterations  <cit> . integrated dna may affect the endogenous genetic locus and result in inactivation of a given gene  <cit> . in some cases, transgene integration has been associated with host genome rearrangements, including duplications  <cit> , translocation  <cit> , and deletions  <cit> . the length of the deleted genome segments might be from 2- <dig> kb  <cit>  to  <dig> kb  <cit> . in the current study, we successfully identified a foreign gene homologous inserted into the xc <dig> region by deletion of the entire  <dig> -bp region of the endogenous dna. although the dna deletion took place, all fad <dig> mice appeared normal, without any apparent lesions, and exhibited normal physiological activities and fertility. sequence analysis revealed that no putative genes were positioned in the deleted  <dig> -bp region in which one gct <dig> phenotype allele of ovarian granulosa cell tumourigenesis  <dig> was involved . previous studies involving juvenile granulosa cell tumours indicate that its susceptibility is an inherited, polygenic trait and that the x-linked gct <dig> allele in the sjl mouse strain cause high-frequency, juvenile-type granulosa cell tumour development in females  <cit> . the fad <dig> gene inserted into the mouse genome could serve both as a mutagen and as a molecular tag to study the role of the gct <dig> allele in juvenile-type granulosa cell tumour.

it is thought that linear dna molecules injected into the pronucleus undergo rapid circularisation followed by random linearisation and concatemers formation by homologous recombination . moreover, the injected molecules could then reconstitute and, most frequently, integrate as a head-to-tail array  <cit> , with a minor modification of nucleotide deletion or insertion at some ends  <cit> . in the present study, the multiple copies of the fad <dig> transgene molecules lost the 5' initial gc dinucleotide, which was subsequently integrated into the x chromosome in a head-to-tail manner . in addition, a head-to-head fusion also occurred in the transgene, whereby one strand joined its partial complementary strand with five additional nucleotides at the same insertion site .

as far as we know, it is not clear exactly how the concatemers insert into the host genome. it was previously reported that the foreign histocompatibility class ii eα gene, injected into pronuclei, was homologous targeted into the transgenic mouse genome  <cit> . in most cases, it is predicted that the foreign dna concatemers would finally integrate into the host genome randomly through imperfect sequence recognition via heterologous recombination  <cit> . in the current study, it is worth noting that the 3-bp common sequence at the 5' junction and the 7-bp common sequence at the 3' junction were shared by the x chromosome and foreign transgenic molecules. furthermore, the homologous nucleotides in the 5' junction would facilitate the recognition of two dnas besides the 3-bp common sequence . such small regions of identity  have been observed in previous studies of non-homologous recombination involving mouse transgenesis  <cit> . this suggests that the successful insertion of the transgene is mediated by these common sequences on both sides, which serve as anchors for the homologous illegitimate random integration  but not heterologous recombination . because the homologous arms are very short and consist only of several identical nucleotides, they can be easily positioned at various regions of the host genome. therefore, it appears that the foreign dna is randomly integrated into the host genome and the integration sites are unpredictable in transgenic animals  <cit> . after homologous recognition between the two dna molecules, the insertion of a foreign dna molecule into a genome is mediated by the dna repair mechanisms of the cell  <cit> .

in addition to the common sequence, a palindromic sequence of 5'-attaat-3' in both 5' and 3' junctions was found in the fad <dig> sequence, but not in the x sequence . this sequence motif is required to induce a localised conversion in streptococcus pneumoniae transformation  <cit> . the ase i restriction endonuclease can recognise and cleave the sequence between the tt dinucleotide  <cit> . at this moment, we are not sure if an endonuclease plays a role in the hiri process.

in mechanistic studies of natural transformation in prokaryotes, de vries & wackernagel reported that short stretches of sequence identity  between the kanamycin-resistant nptii+ gene and the recipient dna of transformed acinetobacter facilitated the integration efficiency of foreign dna into the prokaryotic genome by homology-facilitated illegitimate recombination using homologous regions ranging in length from  <dig> kb to  <dig> bp  <cit> . simultaneously, a consistent integration mechanism, mediated by one-side homologous substrates and containing identical 4- <dig> nucleotide sequences between the donor and recipient dna, was also observed in the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae transformed by recombinant lambda bacteriophage  <cit> . in addition, in pseudomonas stutzeri a similar phenomenon was observed, in which part of the short anchor segments recombined into the host genome  <cit> . in eukaryotes, events of illegitimate integration whose homologous sequences are very short  are also found in mammalian cells  <cit> , transgenic embryos  <cit> , and mice  <cit> . taken together, our observations suggest that the hiri process is present in all organisms undergoing transformation/transgenesis .

interestingly, although the hiri process in prokaryotes usually happens within segments of high gc content  <cit> , our results reveal that it occurred in the at-rich, not gc-rich, region between the two dnas in eukaryotes . similar results have been found in the transgenic embryo  <cit> . a systematic analysis of multiple illegitimate integration sites in somatic cells has found that in 93% of cases, these sites are only  <dig> bp away from a potential topoisomerase i cleavage site. the association of topoisomerase i sites with runs of purines and at-rich regions with the site of integration is also significant  <cit> . purine tracts can adopt non-b-dna conformations, which may be able to recombine; these sequences are found in the centromeres and may promote recombination of the satellite dna  <cit> . these observations suggest that at-rich regions might be involved in the hiri process.

although in murine transformed 3t <dig> cells the poly  signal of the rabbit β-globin can direct efficient termination of polyomavirus dna transcription through rna polymerase ii  <cit> , in hela cells, in some cases, transcription of the foreign gene does not terminate thoroughly by the terminal signal of the 537-bp poly  full sequences  <cit> . the nucleotide sequence of the 3' flanking region of the rabbit β-globin gene was transcribed  <dig> bp past the poly  site. the transcription level in the m <dig> bacteriophage vector gradually declines, under control of its own enhancer and promoter  <cit> . in fad <dig> mice, the transgene was expressed efficiently under the driven of the cmv enhancer and β-actin promoter  and its transcription had not been terminated thoroughly by the terminal signal of the rabbit β-globin gene poly  yet. rt-pcr results revealed that the  <dig>  kb flanking regions post the 3' integration site was transcribed within all examined fad <dig> tissues whereas these genomic regions kept silence in wild type . consistent with the previous study  <cit> , these transcription level might gradually declines and the transcripts of the  <dig> -kb distal flanking regions of the 3' integration site had not been detected within all examined fad <dig> tissues .

in mammals, dosage compensation takes place by silencing one of the two x chromosomes in female cells to achieve transcriptional balance with the xy male  <cit> . transgenes carried on the x chromosome occasionally either escape the normal x-inactivation process  <cit>  or behave like an x-linked gene  <cit> . the cloning and characterisation of the host sequences flanking these inserts may contribute to our understanding of the molecular control mechanisms of chromosome pairing  <cit>  and mammalian x-inactivation  <cit> . as an x-linked transgene, the relative expression of fad <dig> was also examined in transgenic somatic tissues. the transgene expression behaved in a fashion similar to silence one of the two x chromosomes in female cells, at least within the tested female tissues. that was, only 50% of x+x cells expressed the fad <dig> gene, whereas all x+x+ female cells or x+y male cells expressed the transgene. subsequently, the relative amount expression of fad <dig> gene in the x+x organs was lower and estimated an approximately 50% amount of the x+x+ female or x+y male cells. these results suggest that the xc <dig> region  is a locus amenable to the normal x-linked expression of foreign genes and can be used as a molecular tag to study the mechanism of x inactivation.

CONCLUSIONS
an x-linked transgenic mouse line is identified firstly in the current study. the real-time rt-pcr analysis indicates that the foreign fad <dig> gene is expressed in all transgenic samples from the fad <dig> females and that the transcription level in the homozygous females is about twice as high as in the heterozygous females. that is, the transgene expression behaves in a fashion similar to silence one of the two x chromosomes in female cells, at least within the tested female tissues.

we successfully map the sequences of both sides of transgene-chromosome in fad <dig> transgenic mice and identify that the 5' and 3' integration sites are located at base  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  respectively. pcr analysis reveals that the entire  <dig> -bp genome in the xc <dig> region of chromosome x is deleted by the foreign dna molecules during the process of random integration. the deleted  <dig> -bp endogenous genomic region includes the ovarian granulosa cell tumourigenesis- <dig> allele.

for each junction sequence, a very short homologous arm  in the at-rich domain, for instance, tgt within the 5' junction and ttaatag within the 3' junction, exists in both foreign fad <dig> gene and the x chromosome and presumably mediates the illegitimate recombination of two dnas as the homologous arms. based on the 5' and 3' junction mapping results, we predict that the foreign dna insert into the host genome through a homologous illegitimate random integration , which depends on several identical nucleotide sequences in the at-rich domains on both sides.
