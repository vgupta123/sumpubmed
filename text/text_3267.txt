BACKGROUND
transcription is one of the most important biological processes taking place in the cell. its control is carried out by a set of proteins known as transcription factors , which can regulate the expression of genes in specific tissues through their binding to dna regulatory elements in nearby genomic regions  <cit> . therefore, the study of tfs and their transcription factor binding sites  has turned out to be a key factor in understanding the regulation of transcription. much attention has recently been devoted not only to predict tfbss but also to model the binding and function of tfs in different tissues  <cit> . many studies have attempted to elucidate aspects such as the binding process, the promoter structure and its regulatory elements in different ways. stormo et al. regarded dna sequences as vertices of a regular simplex in order to explain the binding mechanism  <cit> ; whereas barash et al. employed bayesian network representations of tfbss to expand the probabilistic representation of dna motifs from an independent position specific-scoring matrix to a full dependency model  <cit> . on the other hand, carninci et al. sequenced tags of several tfbss in mouse and human genomes to analyze the evolution of different promoter classes, thus identifying new transcription start sites  that facilitated the identification of tissue-specific promoters and their cis-acting elements  <cit> . smith et al. studied proximal promoters of human and mouse genes across differentiated tissues to identify regulatory modules capable of differentiating changes in expression and thus explain tissue-specific differential expression  <cit> . other works have focused specifically on cis-regulatory modules , even though unknown functional solitary sites could be ruled out. sharov et al. identified potential crms defined as groups of conserved tfbss in the entire mouse genome  <cit> . li et al. found common properties that might help in the identification of crms and the understanding of their function. they reported that crms do indeed share common features such as elevated gc contents, increased levels of interspecific sequence conservation, and tendency to be transcribed into rna  <cit> . loo et al. proposed an algorithm for detecting crms in groups of co-expressed genes. their predictions showed a high enrichment of crms close to the tss for differentiated tissues versus a depletion of them for embryonic development gene sets in this region  <cit> . segal et al. designed a thermodynamic model for computing expression patterns where cis-regulatory sequences, binding-site preferences and expression of tfs were taken into account. their model, validated in drosophila melanogaster, accurately predicted expression patterns of crms and showed the presence of positional information in regulatory sequences  <cit> . since promoters might contain a variety of tfbss for different tfs, it is no longer enough to think of these entities acting individually. regarding the dependency among tfbss and the hypothesis that genes showing similar expression profiles could share common structural characteristics in their regulatory regions, vandenbon et al. proposed a simple markov chain-based promoter architecture model as an alternative to the crm approaches. their method included characteristics such as orientation, position with respect to the translation start site  and order of predicted occurrences of over-represented motifs  <cit> . however the motif patterns of promoter regions in plants have been inadequately analyzed. since the analysis of promoter regions is also easier in genomes with short intergenic regions, we chose the arabidopsis thaliana genome to conduct our analysis. previously, molina and grotewold made use of a combination of expectation-maximization and gibbs sampling methods to identify motifs over-represented in a. thaliana core promoters  <cit> . however they did not focus on the combination of their predicted motifs to identify patterns of sets of motifs within promoters of co-expressed genes in specific structures of this organism.

in this study, we used the distance and orientation of motifs over-represented in four different plant structures  and in the whole a. thaliana to build specific motif patterns in order to capture the promoter region of co-expressed genes. we predicted motifs specific to four different pss and to the entire a. thaliana where  <dig> of them did not match significantly to cis-acting regulatory elements stored in the place database  <cit>  and were thus considered novel motifs. in the next step, five novel patterns of motif combinations that describe the promoter architecture of genes expressed in "flower", "seed", "root", "shoot" and the "whole plant" were built. each pattern identified a significant number of genes expressed in petal differentiation, synergid cells, root hair and trichome; as well as housekeeping genes from the whole a. thaliana genome. these results indicate the presence of patterns and the suitability of our approach to identify them.

RESULTS
we used here the atted-ii, which is a database of co-expressed a. thaliana genes deduced from microarray data  <cit> . after getting specific groups of co-expressed genes, each was split into two further subsets: a set to predict motifs and another to choose the best ps-specific promoters and build novel motif patterns . in order to find a similar promoter architecture for co-expressed genes in four different a. thaliana structures and the whole plant, we started our analysis by predicting motifs  with key regulatory roles in the following pss: flower, seed, root, shoot and the entire plant.

selection of ps-specific motifs
the motif-prediction process per set of promoters identified  <dig> flower-specific motifs,  <dig> seed-specific motifs,  <dig> root-specific motifs,  <dig> shoot-specific motifs and  <dig> whole plant-specific motifs, respectively . to remove redundant motifs, each position frequency matrix was converted to a k-mer frequency vector that was then used to build a distance matrix by the pearson correlation distance. this matrix was used to cluster each group of ps-specific motifs by average-linkage hierarchical method. the optimal number of clusters per ps was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for flower, seed, root, shoot and whole plant, respectively . hereafter the whole plant will be referred to as a ps for simplicity. the group specificity score   <cit>  of each motif was computed and motifs with the smallest score per cluster were chosen for further analysis. the selected motifs were further compared with plant cis-acting regulatory elements in the place database  <cit> . motifs with p-values less than  <dig>  were regarded as known motifs, otherwise, novel ones. in order to restrict as much as possible our motif comparison, we chose a strict p-value equal to that successfully used to validate the motif comparison algorithm tomtom . as a result, motif rt_ <dig>  matched to aciipvpal <dig> , motif sd_ <dig>  matched to acgtseed <dig>  and motif plt_ <dig>  matched to intronlower . on the contrary, flower-specific motifs flw_ <dig>  flw_ <dig>  flw_ <dig> and flw_ <dig> , root-specific motifs rt_ <dig> and rt_ <dig> , seed-specific motif sd_ <dig>  and shoot-specific motif sht_ <dig>  did not match significantly to any known cis-acting regulatory element in the place database, thus representing potentially new regulatory motifs in plants. we also compared our predicted motifs with others previously reported in a. thaliana  <cit> . as a result, motif plt_ <dig>  matched to motif_ <dig> , motif rt_ <dig>  matched to motif_ <dig>  and motif sd_ <dig>  matched to motif_ <dig>  with p-values less than  <dig> . in addition, we compared our  <dig> novel motifs to those stored in jaspar database  <cit>  and found that all the compared plant motifs matched significantly to motifs in other organisms .

classification of ps-specific promoters
each group of training promoter regions was scanned for tfbss of its ps-specific motifs on both strands and matrices  composed of 12-component, 6-component, 10-component, 8-component and 4-component vectors characterizing the promoter regions in flower, seed, root, shoot and the whole plant were created. for each "training matrix", another matrix composed of background promoter regions, which were not included in both the "model-build set" and the "motif-prediction set"  of a ps was further formed. after training the support vector machine  with the corresponding matrices, each remaining single-promoter set was used for evaluating its performance . considering a leave one-out cross-validation approach, the svm of the flower model achieved the highest accuracy of  <dig> %. in addition, the svms of seed, root and plant models reached similar accuracies of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, whereas that of the shoot model achieved the lowest accuracy of  <dig> %.

creation of novel motif patterns
using the results of the svm predictions, we next tried to create patterns composed of motif sets that may help us to decipher a similar architecture for promoters of co-expressed genes. for this, we used the promoter regions correctly classified by every svm to create five distinct promoter sets in flower, seed, root, shoot and whole plant, respectively. each previous promoter set was scanned for tfbss of the respective ps-specific motifs within four different intervals:  <cit> , ,  and  on both strands. the motifs present in more than 60% of promoters in flower, seed, root and shoot as well as 50% of promoters in whole plant were used to build patterns of sets of motifs to describe the promoters of co-expressed genes in the four pss and the entire plant .

flower-pattern
the pattern for promoters of genes expressed in flower comprises four motifs . it was observed that motif flw_ <dig> has a strong tendency to be present throughout the promoter region on both strands, whereas motifs flw_ <dig> and flw_ <dig> have a tendency to be found on both strands at the region  <dig> to - <dig> near the translation start site . the presence of flw_ <dig> and flw_ <dig> at the core promoter region on both strands could possibly facilitate a stronger binding of the transcriptional machinery. on the other hand, motif flw_ <dig> has a tendency to be at the region - <dig> to - <dig> on both strands. figure 6a  shows the promoter region of genes expressed in petal differentiation identified by our method. in addition, motifs flw_ <dig> and flw_ <dig> were present in less than 47% of promoters, so it is possible that their tfs do not act independently at specific distances from the tls but their role in transcription might be related to the presence of other tfs with which they act in cooperation. motif flw_ <dig> is, on the other hand, present on minus strand at the region  <dig> to - <dig> in  <dig> % of promoters, whereas on both strands at the region - <dig> to - <dig> in  <dig> % of promoters.

seed-pattern
the pattern for promoters of genes expressed in seed combines all the motifs over-represented in this ps . motif sd_ <dig> shows a tendency to appear on plus strand at the region - <dig> to - <dig>  but on both strands at the region  <dig> to - <dig>  the presence of motif sd_ <dig> is restricted to the region - <dig> to - <dig> on both strands, whereas motif sd_ <dig> tends to appear on minus strand at the region  <dig> to - <dig>  figure 6b  shows the promoter region of genes expressed in synergid cells. in addition, motif sd_ <dig> is sparsely present  on both strands at the region - <dig> to - <dig>  motif sd_ <dig>  on the other hand, is also poorly represented  on both strands at the region - <dig> to - <dig> 

root-pattern
the pattern for promoters of genes expressed in root combines the presence of four motifs . motif rt_ <dig> shows a strong tendency to be on both strands throughout the promoter region. motifs rt_ <dig> and rt_ <dig> tend to appear at the region - <dig> to - <dig> on both strands and motif rt_ <dig> that significantly matched to tatabox <dig> has a tendency to be bound at about the same distance reported for a tata box. figure 6c  shows the promoter region of genes expressed in root hair. since motifs rt_ <dig> and rt_ <dig> are poorly present  at the region  <dig> to - <dig> on both strands, the tfs of both motifs might be somehow linked. the tf binding to motif rt_ <dig> seems to have an important role within the core promoter region, whereas the tfs of motifs rt_ <dig> and rt_ <dig> could be cooperating at specific distances from each other on both strands at the region - <dig> to - <dig> 

shoot-pattern
the pattern for promoters of genes expressed in shoot combines the presence of three motifs . motif sht_ <dig> tends to appear throughout the promoter region on both strands, whereas motifs sht_ <dig> and sht_ <dig> show a tendency to be found at the region - <dig> to - <dig> on minus strand. figure 6d  shows the promoter region of genes expressed in trichome. the fact that motifs sht_ <dig> and sht_ <dig> tend to be on the same strand at specific distances from the tls may suggest not only a presence of their tfs at these specific positions but also at precise distances between them.

whole plant-pattern
the pattern for promoters of housekeeping genes expressed in the whole plant comprises the presence of only two motifs . motif plt_ <dig> tends to appear throughout the promoter region on both strands, whereas motif plt_ <dig> has a tendency to be found at the region  <dig> to - <dig> on minus strand. figure 6e  shows the promoter region of plant housekeeping genes. surprisingly, motif plt_ <dig> is poorly present  at the region - <dig> to - <dig> on plus strand, while its presence is more clearly visible near the core promoter region. it is possible that more than two tfs might be involved in the transcription of genes expressed in the whole plant, but our method of obtaining over-represented motifs might have ruled out their motifs.

genome-wide prediction of co-expressed genes
we used the above described motif patterns: "flower-pattern", "seed-pattern", "root-pattern", "shoot-pattern" and "whole plant-pattern" to search for genes expressed in each ps within the entire a. thaliana genome. we ruled out all the a. thaliana's genes whose promoter regions were more than 60% similar. as a result, the initial set of  <dig>  <dig> genes was reduced to  <dig>  <dig> genes. we thus identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes whose promoters satisfied the motif patterns. in order to illustrate the validity of our predictions we checked the plant ontology terms  per group of predicted genes. we found  <dig>  out of  <dig> genes expressed in petal differentiation and expansion stage,  <dig>  out of  <dig> genes expressed in synergid cells,  <dig>  out of  <dig> genes expressed in root hair,  <dig>  out of  <dig> genes expressed in trichome and  <dig>  out of  <dig> genes with housekeeping function . the poor accuracy of trichome could be due to similar promoter structures between genes expressed in "shoot" and those expressed in the other four pss. such similarity could impede the svm from correctly differentiating the promoters of trichome-expressed genes.

discussion
from the  <dig> motifs predicted in promoters of genes expressed in the analyzed pss,  <dig> of them did not match significantly to either cis-regulatory elements in the place database  <cit>  or previous plant motifs reported in  <cit> . this work reports novel patterns of sets of motifs capable of describing the promoter architecture of co-expressed genes in four distinct pss and the entire plant a. thaliana. it regarded two features of promoter regions: orientation and distance of tfbss from the tls. each ps-specific "motif-prediction set" was used to search for motifs. those ps-specific over-represented motifs were employed to scan the promoter regions and compute specific features. despite the lack of transparent results achieved by a svm, its kernel allows flexibility in separating ps-specific promoters from background genomic promoters. unlike artificial neural networks that give multiple solutions related to a local minimal and may not be robust enough over distinct instances, a svm gives a unique solution considering the convexity of the optimization problem. hence a svm was trained to discriminate between ps-specific promoters and background genomic promoters. those correctly classified promoters per ps were scanned for tfbss of their over-represented motifs within four bins covering the entire promoter region:  <dig> to - <dig>  - <dig> to - <dig>  - <dig> to - <dig> and - <dig> to - <dig>  thus defining five motif patterns: "flower-pattern", "seed-pattern", "root-pattern", "shoot-pattern" and "whole plant-pattern". such patterns were used to scan the a. thaliana genome and uncovered  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes expressed in petal differentiation, synergid cells, root hair and trichome, and  <dig> housekeeping genes. since tss data is not available for a. thaliana, generally the distance between tss and tls is believed to be short in this species. a former study has also suggested the presence of more putatively functional motifs in the 5'utr regions of a. thaliana than previously thought  <cit> . our study encompasses two key points:  a support vector machine to discriminate promoters of genes expressed in four different pss and in the whole plant from background genomic promoters and  novel patterns of sets of motifs able to successfully describe the promoter architecture of co-expressed genes in four pss and in the entire a. thaliana.

CONCLUSIONS
we have worked with promoter sets of genes expressed in four different a. thaliana structures and in the whole plant. regulatory motifs specific to each promoter group were predicted and  <dig> of them with key regulatory functions in four pss were potentially new and yet unknown motifs. in addition, five distinct patterns of sets of ps-specific motifs able to describe the promoter region of co-expressed genes were built and shown to be useful in predicting genes expressed in specific biological processes from the entire a. thaliana genome. to our knowledge, several works have attempted to elucidate the promoter architecture in different higher organisms, but none of them have been focused on plants. as the motif patterns indicate, the motifs along with their positioning and orientation within the tfbss at specific distances from the tls is a reliable measure to differentiate promoters of genes expressed in different a. thaliana structures from background genomic promoters. this method could be used to predict novel motifs and decipher a similar promoter architecture for genes co-expressed in a. thaliana in other tissues and conditions. we are trying to incorporate additional characteristics of promoters such as distance and order between motifs as to achieve promoter architecture models as broad as possible. future analyses are expected to uncover novel regulatory motifs and a common promoter architecture for genes expressed in tissues or cells of different metazoans.
