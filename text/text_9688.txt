BACKGROUND
pathogenic spirochetes belonging to the genus borrelia cause lyme disease and relapsing fever, both of which are vector-borne illnesses. lyme disease is caused by pathogenic spirochetes of the borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex which are transmitted to humans through the bite of hard-bodied ixodes ticks  <cit> . the earliest manifestations of lyme disease include a characteristic skin rash, termed erythema migrans, along with concomitant flu-like symptoms followed by disorders of the heart, nervous system, and joints  <cit> . globally, most cases of lyme disease can be attributed to three borrelia genospecies, b. burgdorferi sensu stricto , b. afzelii, and b. garinii. in recent years, however, the number of genospecies associated with lyme disease has expanded to include other organisms such as b. bissettii, b. valaisiana, b. spielmanii, and b. lusitaniae . a second group of borrelia spirochetes including b. hermsii, b. recurrentis, b. duttonii, b. parkeri, b. crocidurae, b. miyamotoi, and b. turicatae, are the causative agents of relapsing fever, a disease characterized by recurring episodes of fever with muscle and joint aches  <cit> . relapsing fever borrelia are generally transmitted to humans by a soft-bodied tick of the genus ornithodoros; however, one genospecies, b. recurrentis, is transmitted by the body louse  <cit> .

similar to gram-negative organisms, borrelia spirochetes are dual-membrane organisms with both an inner membrane and an outer membrane ; however, borrelia species lack lipopolysaccharide  <cit> . instead, the surface of borrelia spirochetes is characterized by the presence of numerous surface-exposed lipoproteins that are attached to the outer leaflet of the om via n-terminal lipid moieties  <cit> . borrelial lipoproteins have been the focus of intense study for several decades and are known to be important in virulence and host-pathogen interactions . many of the borrelial lipoproteins are plasmid-encoded and differentially expressed throughout the life cycle of the organism .

the om of gram-negative organisms contain membrane-spanning, outer membrane proteins  that form amphipathic β-barrels that can typically form nonspecific or substrate-specific om pores  <cit> . freeze-fracture electron microscopy of the b. burgdorferi om confirmed that the borrelial om also possess integral omps, although the number of omps in the borrelial om is at least 10-fold reduced as compared to escherichia coli  <cit> . the borrelia omps identified to date are implicated in nutrient acquisition, antibiotic resistance, host-pathogen interactions, protein transport and assembly, and pore formation . these proteins are characterized by their om-localization and/or surface exposure but are not lipid-modified lipoproteins. unlike the majority of the surface-exposed lipoproteins, all of the borrelial omps identified thus far are encoded on the ~ <dig> kb linear chromosome . while it is known that the borrelial om contains membrane spanning omps with β-barrel structure and/or pore-forming capabilities that are important in overall physiology and host interactions, fewer than  <dig> borrelial proteins have been identified as potential omps and only half of those have thus far been characterized . of the known borrelial omps, b. burgdorferi proteins bama , besc , dipa , p <dig> , and p <dig>  have been shown to form a β-barrel, to form pores in the borrelial om, or to be functional orthologs to known omps. efforts to identify novel omps in borrelia spirochetes have been hindered for several reasons, including the low abundance of borrelial omps in the borrelia om and the unique fragility of the borrelial om. moreover, few orthologs to well-characterized proteins from other bacterial organisms have been identified through sequence comparison analyses  <cit> .

given the challenges of identifying borrelial omps using conventional biochemical and proteomic approaches, we created a bioinformatics approach that utilizes an algorithm for predicting omps based on their unique properties and secondary structures. using the derived computer-based algorithm, we examined chromosomally encoded proteins from both lyme disease and relapsing fever borrelia to identify candidate proteins that were both conserved and predicted to be omps in the genus borrelia. known borrelial omps were identified on the final candidate omp list; and, importantly, three of the previously uncharacterized b. burgdorferi proteins identified by this method  were confirmed to be omps, indicating the computer-based methodology could, in fact, predict novel borrelial omps. specifically, we determined that the b. burgdorferi protein bb <dig> is amphiphilic and has surface-exposed regions that were accessible to proteases. b. burgdorferi bb <dig> was previously shown by our laboratory to be a surface-exposed protein that localized to the om  <cit> , and bb <dig> and bb <dig> were detected in om vesicles by pal and colleagues in a study examining the overall protein and lipoprotein content of the borrelial om  <cit> . herein, we found that bb <dig> was indeed amphiphilic and localized to the b. burgdorferi om as shown previously for bb <dig> and that both bb <dig> and bb <dig> are pore-forming proteins.

RESULTS
computational framework for predicting borrelia burgdorferi b <dig> outer membrane proteins
to date, few b. burgdorferi outer membrane proteins  have been identified  <cit> ; therefore, we aimed to identify novel b. burgdorferi b <dig> omps that are localized to the om but are not borrelial lipoproteins. we used a bioinformatics strategy  modified from one used recently to predict omps in the spirochete treponema pallidum  <cit> . given that all borrelia omps identified to date are chromosomally encoded and that we anticipate chromosomally encoded proteins will be more conserved among borrelia strains  <cit> , we focused on identifying novel omps encoded on the b. burgdorferi b <dig> chromosome. as summarized in fig.  <dig>  to generate a list of candidate b. burgdorferi omps, we eliminated predicted lipoproteins and proteins predicted to contain transmembrane α-helices, retained protein sequences predicted to be om-localized and/or to form β-barrels, removed sequences that were orthologous to known non-omps, and retained proteins with predicted n-terminal signal peptides. more specifically, all protein sequences encoded from the b. burgdorferi b <dig> chromosome were first analyzed for their potential to be a spirochaetal lipoprotein according to the methods described by setubal, et al.  <cit>  and/or to contain transmembrane α-helices by either one of two algorithms . as neither of these properties are characteristic of integral omps, all sequences predicted to encode membrane anchored lipoproteins or to contain one or more alpha-helical transmembrane domains were eliminated from the candidate omp list. the  <dig> sequences remaining were then examined for their likelihood to encode a protein localized to the om and predicted to form a β-barrel. any sequence predicted to be om-localized by one of two programs that predict cellular localization  was retained as a candidate omp and was then examined for β-barrel topology given that all structurally characterized omps from diderm organisms form β-barrels. the programs hhomp  <cit> , tmbdisc-acc  <cit> , pred-tmbb  <cit> , and bomp  <cit>  were used to examine β-barrel propensity, and proteins were retained if they were predicted to be a β-barrel by at least one of the four or two of the four β-barrel prediction programs depending on if the sequence was predicted to be om-localized by two or one of the om-localization programs, respectively. next, any sequence orthologous to proteins that are known not to be omps in other organisms were excluded from the list of candidate borrelial omps. finally, we also analyzed the first  <dig> amino acids of the remaining sequences for the presence of a canonical n-terminal signal peptide. given that proteins localized to the om would require a signal peptide, we removed from the list any protein not predicted to have a signal peptide by at least one of four signal peptide prediction programs . a final list of  <dig> b. burgdorferi b <dig> candidate omps was compiled . to further prioritize this list, we categorized sequences according to the number of computational programs predicting om localization and/or β-barrel topology from the following six programs mentioned above: cello, psortb  <dig> , hhomp, tmbdisc-acc, pred-tmbb, and bomp. for instance, our highest priority candidate omps are those sequences for which all six programs predicted the encoded protein to be an omp, and we considered any that were predicted by three or more of the localization and/or β-barrel topology programs to be putative omps worthy of further analysis.fig.  <dig> computational framework for predicting om-localized, β-barrel proteins from b. burgdorferi b <dig>  all proteins encoded on the b. burgdorferi b <dig> chromosome were subjected to filters as shown. the following steps outline the computational framework utilized in the study:  proteins predicted to be spirochaetal lipoproteins were discarded,  proteins predicted to contain transmembrane α-helices by one of two programs were discarded,  proteins predicted to be om-localized by one of two programs were retained,  proteins predicted to form a β-barrel by at least one of four or two of four β-barrel prediction programs depending on if the sequences was predicted to be om-localized by two or one of the om-localization programs were retained,  proteins orthologous to known non-omps were discarded,  proteins predicted to have a n-terminal signal peptide by at least one of four programs were retained, and  the remaining proteins were categorized by the number of programs predicting om-localization or propensity to form a β-barrel. the number of sequences remaining after each filter are indicated. proteins were removed from the candidate omp list if the sequence was not predicted to be om localized and have β-barrel conformation by three of the following six algorithims: cello, psortb, hhomp, tmbetadisc-aac, pred-tmbb, and bomp

aproteins are grouped according to the number of om prediction programs that predict localization to the om or β-barrel formation. the outer membrane protein prediction programs included cello, psortb, hhomp, tmbetadisc-acc, pred-tmbb and bomp


bsignal sequences were predicted by the programs signalp  <dig> , predisi, and signal-cf. signal sequences were also manually inspected by hydrophilicity plots generated according to the methods of kyte and doolittle



importantly, we identified several known borrelial omps by the computational framework utilized suggesting that the algorithm was effective at identifying omps encoded in the b. burgdorferi b <dig> genome. within the first group of candidate omps  were two borrelial proteins previously identified and characterized as omps: bama  <cit>  and the pore-forming omp dipa  <cit>  . furthermore, we also identified in group  <dig>  the borrelial omp p <dig> , a known adhesin that binds β3-integrins , has porin activity  <cit> , and adopts a β-barrel conformation  <cit> . in group  <dig> , the known omp besc  <cit>  was also identified using the algorithm outlined. notably, pal and colleagues previously identified borrelial proteins associated with om complexes from b. burgdorferi b <dig>  <cit> . when we compared our list of candidate omps with the list of proteins detected in the borrelial om in this prior report, we found numerous similarities, including the known borrelial omps dipa, bama, p <dig>  and besc as well as the hypothetical proteins bb <dig>  bb <dig>  bb <dig>  bb <dig>  and bb <dig> 

in addition to the known borrelial omps identified in group  <dig>  two uncharacterized hypothetical proteins, bb <dig> and bb <dig>  were also predicted as potential candidate omps in this first group . the protein bb <dig> is encoded by an orf situated directly upstream of bama, which is a known omp. bb <dig> has a conserved duf <dig> domain which has been reportedly found in tamb orthologs  <cit> . while tamb is actually an inner membrane protein that is part of the translocation and assembly module , the c-terminus of tamb is predicted to have β-sheet topology and has been predicted by numerous computer-based prediction programs to be similar to a β-barrel omp . given this previous work with tamb from other organisms, it is not surprising that bb <dig> was identified as a candidate omp in our studies. bb <dig>  also identified in group  <dig>  is encoded by an orf downstream of b. burgdorferi b <dig> uvra and uvrb, which encode proteins involved in nucleotide excision repair  <cit> . interestingly, bb <dig> has a conserved lptd  domain, which is the known om, β-barrel component of the translocation complex that transports lipopolysaccharide  to the cell surface  <cit> .

unlike the first three groups, no fully characterized borrelial omps were included in the group  <dig> list of candidates that were predicted to be an omp by  <dig> of the  <dig> localization and topology programs. it should be noted, however, that bb <dig> was identified in group  <dig>  and we have previously reported that bb <dig> is likely localized to the om, is amphiphilic, and appears to be surface-exposed  <cit> . the paralogous bb <dig> , encoded by the orf immediately downstream of bb <dig>  also was included in this group of candidates.

b. burgdorferi b <dig> bb <dig> is a surface-exposed, amphiphilic protein
to confirm that the computational method utilized to screen for candidate proteins did, in fact, correctly identify novel omps from b. burgdorferi, we next examined the cellular localization of specific candidate omps identified. as mentioned above, group  <dig> contained the candidate bb <dig>  that encodes an lptd domain, which is a characteristic of lptd proteins known to contain a c-terminal β-barrel region. consistent with bb <dig> being a putative omp, when bb <dig> was modeled without a specified template using the i-tasser  and sparks-x  <cit>  programs, lptd proteins were identified as the top hit for structural modeling similarities in all cases. bb <dig> is predicted to be approximately 120 kda and is encoded downstream of uvrb and uvra. given that uvrb, uvra, and bb <dig> were all located in close proximity on the chromosome, with the uvra and bb <dig> orfs overlapping, we first examined whether these genes were part of an operon using rt-pcr. this analysis confirmed that uvrb, uvra, and bb <dig> are encoded on the same transcript . we next examined whether bb <dig> is membrane-associated by performing triton x- <dig> phase partitioning studies to separate membrane proteins from soluble cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins  <cit> . bb <dig> partitioned into the detergent-enriched fractions after triton x- <dig> phase partitioning of b. burgdorferi b <dig> whole-cell lysates suggesting that bb <dig> has the properties expected of an amphiphilic membrane protein . for phase partitioning experiments, the lipoprotein bamb  <cit>  served as a membrane protein control, while the soluble skp protein partitioned into the aqueous phase as expected .fig.  <dig> 
b. burgdorferi b <dig> bb <dig> is surface localized and amphiphilic. a. bb <dig> is in an operon with uvra and uvrb. schematic of the uvrb, uvra, and bb <dig> operon is shown in the top panel. total rna was isolated from b. burgdorferi b <dig> cells and used for rt-pcr using primer pairs listed in table  <dig>  primer pairs were used that amplify a region traversing uvrb and uvra  and uvra and bb <dig> . a negative control lacking rt was used as template for the rt-pcr  as was as a positive control in which genomic dna instead of cdna was used as template . b. triton x- <dig> phase partitioning of b. burgdorferi b <dig> whole-cell lysates was performed to separate soluble, aqueous  phase proteins from amphiphilic, detergent  phase proteins. aqueous and detergent fractions were separated by sds-page and immunoblotted with anti-bb <dig> peptide antibodies. equivalent fractions were also immunoblotted with anti-bamb and anti-skp antibodies as detergent-enriched and aqueous-enriched controls, respectively. c-d. whole-cell lysates were washed and incubated with  proteinase k  or  trypsin. samples were then immunoblotted with bb <dig> peptide antibodies to assess surface degradation of bb <dig>  equivalent samples were also immunoblotted with ospa antibodies or p <dig> antibodies for pk and trypsin experiments, respectively, to control for protease activity and with antibodies that recognize the periplasmic protein flab to ensure that the om remained intact throughout the proteolysis experiments. molecular weight standards  are shown at left



to assess whether bb <dig> is surface-exposed, b. burgdorferi b <dig> cells were treated with protease proteinase k . immunoblot analysis of pk treated cells revealed that bb <dig> is at least partially susceptible to pk degradation suggesting that the protein has surface-exposed regions . in fact, pk treatment resulted in a breakdown of the full length protein of approximately 120 kda to a smaller protein band of approximately 33 kda . to further characterize the potential surface-exposed regions of bb <dig>  we also treated cells with the protease trypsin, which specifically targets the carboxyl side of lysine and arginine residues for proteolysis. trypsin proteolysis resulted in a degradation pattern similar to pk treatment; however, the breakdown product was slightly larger than the protein band detected when cells were treated with pk . for both pk and trypsin assays, known pk and trypsin sensitive proteins ospa and p <dig>  respectively, were degraded in the presence of the enzyme as expected . furthermore, the periplasmic flab protein was not degraded in either experiment and served as a control for membrane integrity throughout the proteolysis studies .

b. burgdorferi b <dig> bb <dig> and bb <dig> are amphiphilic and om-localized
both b. burgdorferi bb <dig> and bb <dig> were detected in group  <dig> of the candidate omp list . the prior observations suggesting that bb <dig> is surface- and om-localized  <cit> , combined with the observation that bb <dig> and bb <dig> are detected in om vesicles isolated from b. burgdorferi b <dig>  <cit> , strongly suggested that group  <dig> also contained novel omps that warranted further characterization. thus, we next examined the cellular localization and physicochemical properties of the two group  <dig> proteins bb <dig> and bb <dig>  we first looked more closely at the genomic organization of bb <dig> and bb <dig> and found that bb <dig> overlaps with the upstream gene bb <dig>  therefore, we examined whether these genes were co-transcribed with the bb <dig>  rt-pcr utilizing primers that amplified regions traversing bb <dig> and bb <dig> as well as bb <dig> and bb <dig> revealed that all three genes are co-expressed in a single transcript . triton x- <dig> phase partitioning experiments revealed that both bb <dig> and bb <dig> are membrane proteins as they both partitioned into the detergent-enriched phase . equivalent fractions were also immunoblotted with anti-bamb antibodies and anti-skp antibodies which served as membrane and soluble protein controls, respectively . since phase partitioning experiments suggested bb <dig> and bb <dig> are amphiphilic, we next examined whether they are localized to the borrelial om. oms and protoplasmic cylinders  were enriched from b. burgdorferi b <dig> cells and subsequently immunoblotted . bb <dig> and bb <dig> were detected in the om fractions indicating both are omps . bama, a known b. burgdorferi b <dig> omp, was detected in the om as expected, while the inner membrane lipoprotein oppaiv was detected only in the pc fraction indicating the om fraction was highly enriched .fig.  <dig> 
b. burgdorferi b <dig> bb <dig> is amphiphilic and om-associated. a. bb <dig>  bb <dig>  and bb <dig> are transcribed as an operon. schematic of the bb <dig>  bb <dig>  and bb <dig> operon is shown in the top panel. total rna was isolated from b. burgdorferi b <dig> cells and used for rt-pcr using primer pairs listed in table  <dig>  primer pairs were used that amplify a region traversing bb <dig> and bb <dig>  and bb <dig> and bb <dig> . a negative control without rt was used as template for the rt-pcr  as was as a positive control in which genomic dna instead of cdna was used as template . b. triton x- <dig> phase partitioning of b. burgdorferi b <dig> whole-cell lysates were performed to separate aqueous-enriched  proteins from detergent-enriched  proteins. aqueous and detergent fractions were separated by sds-page and immunoblotted with rat anti-bb <dig> and rat anti-bb <dig> antibodies. as controls, equivalent fractions were also immunoblotted with antibodies directed against the detergent-soluble lipoprotein bamb and the soluble, periplasmic protein skp. c. outer membrane  and protoplasmic cylinder  fractions were isolated from b. burgdorferi b <dig>  subsequently, om and pc fractions were immunoblotted with rat anti-bb <dig> and anti-bb <dig> antibodies. equivalent membranes were also subjected to immunoblot with bama and oppaiv antibodies. d. whole-cell lysates were washed and incubated with proteinase k . samples were then immunoblotted with bb <dig> or bb <dig> antibodies to assess surface degradation of the protein. equivalent samples were also immunoblotted with ospa antibodies to control for protease activity and with antibodies that recognize the periplasmic protein flab to ensure that the om remained intact throughout the proteolysis experiments



given that bb <dig> and bb <dig> are om-localized and display the properties expected of omps, we next examined whether bb <dig> and bb <dig> are also surface-exposed. pk surface-localization assays were performed and pk treated and sham treated cell lysates were immunoblotted with bb <dig> and bb <dig> antibodies. surprisingly, while bb <dig> was partially pk sensitive with only an ~10 kda region of  <dig> being protected from the pk degradation, bb <dig> was entirely pk resistant . this suggested that bb <dig> is either not surface-exposed or is protease resistant. ospa served as a positive control in the pk experiments . to confirm that the om remained intact during pk surface proteolysis, equivalent membranes were also immunoblotted with anti-flab antibodies to demonstrate that the periplasmic flab protein was not exposed to pk degradation .

b. burgdorferi b <dig> bb <dig> and bb <dig> associate with and form pores in luvs
since both bb <dig> and bb <dig> are associated with the om, we next wanted to determine if these proteins could integrate into lipid bilayers and form pores. to examine whether folded recombinant b. burgdorferi bb <dig> and bb <dig> could incorporate into large unilamellar vesicles  that were generated to mimic the phospholipid content of the b. burgdorferi b <dig> om  <cit> , luvs were incubated separately with folded recombinant bb <dig> or bb <dig>  the mixture was then separated on discontinuous sucrose gradients to separate the liposome-containing top fraction  from the bottom fraction , which contains unincorporated protein. fractions were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antisera directed against bb <dig> or bb <dig>  both proteins were detected in the tf suggesting that bb <dig> and bb <dig> were able to incorporate into liposomes . when experiments were also performed with folded recombinant e. coli ompa, a well characterized om protein  <cit> , ompa was also detected in the tf . as expected, the soluble gst protein was unable to incorporate into luvs and was thus only detected in the bf .fig.  <dig> 
a. liposomes simulating the b. burgdorferi b <dig> om were incubated with recombinant bb <dig>  bb <dig>  e. coli ompa, or gst and then separated on discontinuous sucrose gradients. gradient fractions were collected from the top  and bottom  and subjected to immunoblot with appropriate antibodies. b. liposomes loaded with the fluorophore tb3
3− were incubated with recombinant b. burgdorferi b <dig> bb <dig>  bb <dig>  p <dig>  e. coli ompf, or e. coli ompa in buffer supplemented with edta, and fluorophore efflux was measured as quenched fluorescence. three independent experiments were compared and each bar represents the mean ± s.e. . statistical significance compared with e. coli ompa is indicated with * 



we next assessed whether bb <dig> and bb <dig> had porin like properties and could form pores in luvs using a pore formation assay to measure efflux of fluorophore tb33− from liposomes incubated with the folded recombinant protein. when liposomes were loaded with folded bb <dig> or bb <dig> protein, fluorophore efflux from the loaded liposomes was detected , indicating that both proteins were capable of forming pores. escape of the fluorophore was also detected when liposomes were incubated with the known pore-forming e. coli protein ompf as well as the b. burgdorferi b <dig> p <dig> protein , which we have previously shown forms pores in luvs  <cit> . in contrast, e. coli ompa, which occurs mostly in a closed conformation, did not efficiently generate pores in the luvs, and thus only low levels of efflux was detected , which is entirely consistent with previous reports  <cit> . taken together these studies suggest that both bb <dig> and bb <dig> are om-localized proteins capable of forming pores.

omp candidate proteins from lyme disease and relapsing fever borrelia
after demonstrating that the computational analysis could accurately predict novel b. burgdorferi omps, we expanded our computational analysis to predict omps from spirochetes belonging to both the lyme disease- and relapsing fever-causing groups . in broadening the scope of the study, we looked specifically for omps conserved among all borrelia genospecies that could be potential universal targets for future vaccine studies. furthermore, novel omps conserved among the borrelia spp. could be important virulence determinants and relevant in spirochete physiology. for this analysis, all chromosomally encoded proteins from twelve lyme disease borrelia including genospecies b. burgdorferi, b. garinii, b. afzelii, b. valaisiana, and b. bissettii and seven relapsing fever borrelia including b. duttonii, b. crocidurae, b. parkeri, b. miyamotoi, b. turicatae, b. recurrentis, and b. hermsii were subjected to the same computational analysis as outlined in fig.  <dig>  all genomes analyzed as well as accession numbers are listed in table  <dig>  and the data collected for all orfs are presented in additional file 1: table s <dig> and summarized in table  <dig>  after collecting the data for all chromosomally encoded protein sequences from nineteen borrelia organisms, candidate omps from each genome were identified using the same process that was described above to identify candidate omps from b. burgdorferi b <dig>  the candidate omps identified from the chromosomes of all nineteen species are listed in additional file 2: table s <dig> table  <dig>

the global analysis of numerous borrelia genomes allowed us to determine which candidate omps are conserved among the various species analyzed. to do this, using cd-hit, we first sorted all protein sequences into orthologous clusters  <cit>  ; these results were then used to construct a heat map  <cit>  that encompassed candidate omps specific to relapsing fever spirochetes, lyme disease spirochetes, or both lyme disease and relapsing fever spirochetes . the cluster analysis also included protein-coding sequences in these genomes that were not predicted to be omps, but were nevertheless orthologous to one or more predicted omps . the heat map also indicates if no ortholog was detected in the cluster for a given genome . in some clusters, almost all of the orthologs within the cluster were predicted to be omps with only a few orthologs not passing the computational analysis used for omp prediction. apparent false negative predictions could be identified as the rare ortholog within a single cluster that was not predicted to be an omp while all of the other cluster members were predicted to be omps. conversely, apparent false positive predictions also were observed that could be visualized as the rare ortholog predicted to be an omp when the majority of the members of the unique cluster were not predicted omps. for instance, bb <dig> was predicted to be an omp by sixteen of the nineteen genomes analyzed from both lyme disease and relapsing fever species, suggesting that it is likely an omp in all genomes and there were three genomes with false negative predictions . the bb <dig> and bb <dig> orthologs were predicted to constitute clusters of candidate omps specific for lyme disease causing spirochetes. one bb <dig> and two bb <dig> orthologs were predicted not to be omps, suggesting these are false negative predictions since 11/ <dig> and 10/ <dig> lyme disease associated genomes predicted bb <dig> and bb <dig> to be an omp, respectively . while relapsing fever spirochetes do encode bb <dig> and bb <dig> orthologs, those protein sequences did not cluster with the orthologs from the lyme disease spirochetes according to the parameters used in this study. collectively, these data provide a group of candidate omps that are conserved among various species of borrelia spirochetes and can be examined as potential omps and virulence factors in future studies.fig.  <dig> to assess the value of these predictions to identify putative vaccine immunogens, predicted omps from each of the borrelia genomes were organized into orthologous clusters, and the resulting information was presented as a heat map. in this analysis, clusters of borrelia proteins predicted to be omps are represented as green blocks, while clusters of borrelia proteins orthologous to these, but not passing all omp prediction filters are represented in red. if a cluster of orthologous proteins was not encoded in a given borrelial genome, this was represented as a black block. these data were then subject to a two-way hierarchical clustering, by genome and by orthologous protein cluster. from this analysis, three groups of predicted omps were identified: group a represents predicted borrelial omps unique to relapsing fever  organisms, group b represents predicted borrelial omps unique to lyme disease  pathogens and group c includes predicted omps shared by both ld and rf pathogens. the candidate omps analyzed in this study are indicated with purple boxes corresponding to bb <dig>  bb <dig>  and bb <dig>  asterisks  indicate known borrelial omps identified in the study including bama, p <dig>  besc, and dipa. a larger version of this figure with cluster ids and genome designations is provided in additional file 4: figure s1



discussion
given that lyme disease and relapsing fever spirochetes are extracellular pathogens, the surface of these spirochetes and the proteins localized to their om provide the interface between these pathogens and their various hosts during infection. it also has been established that humoral immunity provides protection against these infections; therefore, borrelial surface proteins have been the target of much study with regards to identifying new vaccine targets. to date, most vaccine studies have focused on the immunogenic surface lipoproteins  with much less emphasis being placed on integral omps localized to the surface of the organism. this is due in part to the fact that surface lipoproteins are highly immunogenic and highly abundant, which has made lipoproteins much easier to identify and characterize than the borrelial omps. in this study, we sought to identify novel omps from borrelia. given that computer-based algorithms do not always accurately predict protein structure, we employed a consensus strategy in which we relied on six different algorithms that predict both om localization and β-barrel conformation to identify candidate borrelial omps . by using this stratified consensus approach, we were able to prioritize candidate omps based on the number of programs predicting that a specific sequence encoded a novel omp. we curated our list by eliminating lipoproteins using a lipoprotein prediction algorithm specific for spirochetes  <cit>  and proteins containing transmembrane domains  <cit>  that are indicative of inner membrane proteins. moreover, we only accepted sequences with an n-terminal signal peptide as would be required for translocation across the bacterial inner membrane, and we again instituted a consensus approach using four different programs to predict signal peptides . importantly, we identified several known borrelial omps by the computational framework utilized including bama, besc, p <dig>  and dipa, and, of the well-characterized omps identified thus far, only the known borrelial omp p <dig> was not identified in our study. in a previous study, chromosomally encoded proteins from all sequenced bacterial genomes including the borrelia spirochetes were analyzed by the tmbb algorithm which aims to identify β-barrel, omps  <cit> . using this single method,  <dig> candidate b. burgdorferi b <dig> omps were identified of which eight were orthologous to non-omps. the study presented herein, however, identified  <dig> candidate omps further supporting the notion that the consensus approach utilized in these studies is an improvement from relying on a single algorithm.

notably, we were able to further prioritize our list of candidate omps by examining and comparing the output generated from the chromosomes of nineteen different lyme disease and relapsing fever organisms. with this approach, candidate omps could be further verified by the overall likelihood that the sequence was predicted to be an omp in numerous other related borrelial organisms. in fact, potential false-positive or false-negative predictions in a single spirochetal species or strain can easily be identified by comparing the omp predictions for proteins in the same cluster from many different organisms as outlined here. furthermore, this more global approach will allow future studies to focus on sequences predicted to be omps in numerous species that are considered viable vaccine candidates based on their overall sequence homology and tendency to cluster together according to the algorithm utilized in this study. the cluster analysis demonstrated that there is a large group of predicted omps that are shared among the genomes of all currently sequenced borrelia spp. analyzed , which potentially represent vaccine candidates that could protect against both lyme disease and relapsing-fever infections. this is an important addition that could not only enhance vaccine development for various spirochete diseases, but this system could also be used for other groups of human pathogens given that one of the major caveats in vaccine development has been generating protective immune responses against multiple strains or species.

while it is likely that some of the candidates identified using the computational algorithm outlined herein are not omps, the physicochemical data provided for bb <dig>  bb <dig>  and bb <dig> provide a robust proof of principle that the algorithm can accurately identify novel omps. interestingly, a larger domain of the c-terminal region of bb <dig> was protected from degradation when organisms were treated with trypsin as compared to proteinase k. this type of proteolysis data would be entirely consistent with a large extracellular loop that contains a trypsin susceptible lysine or arginine residue but is otherwise fully susceptible to proteinase k degradation. consistent with this notion, the b. burgdorferi omp p <dig> also has been shown in previous studies to be partially sensitive to both proteinase k and trypsin with a lysine residue in a surface loop that is uniquely susceptible to trypsin  <cit> . interestingly, bb <dig> was found to be co-transcribed with uvra and uvrb. uvra and uvrb along with uvrc and uvrd are members of the nucleotide excision repair  pathway which was previously shown to be the only borrelial dna repair pathway that functions to repair dna in response to uv light damage  <cit> . in fact, b. burgdorferi spirochetes appear to have a reduced number of dna repair enzymes  <cit> . why a potential borrelial omp such as bb <dig> would be co-expressed with two components of the ner pathway is unclear. it is worth noting, however, that this gene arrangement and genomic organization was conserved among all lyme disease- and relapsing fever-causing spirochetes examined. this conservation in gene organization and, by correlation, co-expression pattern of uvrab and bb <dig> and its various orthologs suggests this happened prior to the divergence of the various borrelia spp. whether bb <dig> can incorporate into liposomes and/or forms a pore remains to be determined. such experiments with bb <dig> could not be performed due to the large size of the full-length native protein and our inability to generate a full-length recombinant protein that was not lethal when expressed in e. coli.

bb <dig> also was observed to be a novel omp that had not previously been identified from b. burgdorferi or any other borrelia spp. to date. as previously suggested, bb <dig> was confirmed to be a surface-exposed omp  <cit> . while we demonstrated that bb <dig> and bb <dig> are om-localized and capable of forming pores, bb <dig> was found to be resistant to proteinase k degradation. complete and partial resistance to protease has been reported for many other bacterial omps , so it was not entirely surprising that a borrelial omp also is protease resistant. given that we have now shown that bb <dig> is a potential porin, it seems most likely bb <dig> has either very little surface exposure or the protein is possibly protected from degradation by interacting with other surface omps or the abundant surface lipoproteins as was previously shown for the known omp p <dig>  <cit> . borreliae are known to have a relatively small genome as compared to other bacterial organisms and are thus dependent on the uptake of nutrients from the host environment. this highlights the importance of proteins such as porins for the survival of the spirochete throughout the organism’s life cycle. yet, a limited number of porins have been identified in b. burgdorferi  <cit>  despite the observation that in black lipid bilayer experiments using borrelial om fractions there are numerous pore-forming proteins that have not been identified  <cit> . while bb <dig> and bb <dig> do form pores, we have not shown that these proteins form β-barrels as was predicted by the computer algorithms utilized in this study. crystal structures will need to be resolved in order to definitively determine whether these proteins are β-barrels as predicted by the algorithm. however, recent reports have examined the structural conformation of both the b. afzelii bb <dig> ortholog   <cit>  and the b. garinii bb <dig> ortholog  using small-angle x-ray scattering  <cit> . notably, in these reports, it was demonstrated that both proteins form structures entirely consistent with an 8-stranded β-barrel further supporting the notion that bb <dig> and bb <dig> fold into β-barrels in the borrelial om.

among previously characterized pore-forming omps in b burgdorferi, p <dig> and p <dig> are both known to be immunogenic and p <dig> has been shown to be at least partially protective in mice challenged with b. burgdorferi b <dig> . prior studies have shown that omps p <dig> and besc are also required for establishing infection in mice  <cit> . along these lines, we also previously observed that antibodies recognizing the putative omp bb <dig> were bactericidal and that nonhuman primates infected with b. burgdorferi elicit a specific antibody response against bb <dig>  <cit> . in other studies, we also have determined that a mutant b. burgdorferi strain lacking bb <dig> and bb <dig> is unable to establish an infection in mice, suggesting that one or both of these proteins is also essential for mammalian infection . whether the inability of the bb0405/ <dig> mutant to infect mice is dependent on the porin function of these proteins is unknown at this time. notably, bg <dig> the b. garinii bb <dig> ortholog and bapk <dig> the b. afzelii bb <dig> orthlolg have both been shown to bind human factor h  <cit> . binding of factor h by bacteria inhibits the alternative pathway of complement and is a method of immune evasion for pathogenic organisms. whether b. burgdorferi bb <dig> also binds factor h is unknown at this time. bb <dig> also may play an important role in the infectious life cycle of b. burgdorferi. when global transposon mutagenesis of b. burgdorferi was performed by norris and colleagues, no transposon insertions were identified within the bb <dig> gene  <cit> , suggesting it is an essential protein.

CONCLUSIONS
the computational and bioinformatics studies presented have identified novel omps from b. burgdorferi  and confirmed that bb <dig> also is a b. burgdorferi omp. furthermore, bb <dig> and bb <dig> were shown to have pore forming properties, suggesting they may play a role in allowing borrelia spp. to sample and respond to environmental changes. in addition to a better catalog of candidate omps from various borrelial species, the computational framework utilized here could also help to identify new vaccine candidates for future studies. as it relates to vaccine-development, the overall clustering observed in fig.  <dig> is provocative and points out specific candidate omps that could be targeted specifically for future lyme disease or relapsing fever vaccine studies. most important, however, is the fact that it may now be possible to identify potential vaccine candidates that could target both of these important human diseases with a single or multi-subunit vaccine consisting of omps shared by both groups. apart from this applied aspect of vaccine development, basic mechanisms of molecular pathogenesis for this wide array of spirochetes could also be revealed in the various omp protein clusters, which could imply functional specialization of specific omps that have evolved to support specific activities by lyme-disease or relapsing-fever spirochetes. further studies will be required to delineate among the proteins identified as to which are actual omps and which may be false positives. finally, while the focus of our study was limited to borrelia spp., it seems self-evident that a similar strategy could be used to identify omps from bacteria other than spirochetes to identify new vaccine targets for many different human diseases.
