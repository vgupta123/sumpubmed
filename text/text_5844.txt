BACKGROUND
in metazoan, blood cells play a critical role in establishing the proper response against invading pathogens or in removing both cancerous and apoptotic cells  <cit> . conversely, deregulations of the hematopoietic differentiation program are at the origin of numerous pathologies, including leukemia and auto-immune diseases  <cit> . as many key signaling pathways and transcription factors controlling blood cell development and functions have been conserved from humans to drosophila  <cit> , this organism has emerged as an attractive model to investigate the genetic basis controlling blood cell homeostasis.

drosophila hematopoiesis occurs in two spatially and temporally distinct phases. in the early embryo, blood cell progenitors  arise from the head mesoderm  <cit> . these hemocytes subsist in the larva either in circulation in the hemolymph or attached to the inner surface of the integument, forming the so-called sessile islands that can be mobilized upon infection  <cit> . a second hematopoietic wave occurs in the larva in a specialized organ called the lymph gland  <cit> . in third instar larvae, the lymph gland is composed of a pair of primary lobes and several more posterior secondary lobes. each primary lobe is subdivided into three zones:  the cortical zone, containing differentiated hemocytes;  the medullary zone, containing prohemocytes; and  the posterior signaling center, a small group of cells whose activity is required to maintain medullary zone cells into a progenitor state  <cit> . the smaller posterior lobes, presenting no organized structure, consist mainly of prohemocytes  <cit> . in normal conditions, both the circulating and sessile cells in the larva are only of embryonic origin  <cit>  whereas hemocytes from the lymph gland are released into circulation only at pupariation  <cit> . finally, in the adult, no hematopoietic tissue has been described and hemocytes of both embryonic and lymph gland origin are observed  <cit> .

prohemocytes give rise to three terminally differentiated cell types: plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes  <cit> . plasmatocytes, which comprise 90-95% of the larval circulating blood cells, are phagocytic cells that engulf apoptotic bodies and pathogens  <cit> . crystal cells secrete components of the melanization cascade, an insect-specific immune reaction involved in wound healing and in the encapsulation of large foreign bodies  <cit> . lamellocytes are large flattened non-phagocytic cells normally scarcely present in the larva but their development is massively induced upon certain immune challenges such as infection of the larvae by eggs of the parasitoid wasp leptopilina boulardi  <cit> . parasitization elicits lymph gland overgrowth, massive production of lamellocytes, and precocious hemocyte release from the lymph gland into the circulation. together with the other blood cell types, lamellocytes form a melanotic capsule around the parasitoid egg to prevent its development  <cit> . while it was initially proposed that lamellocytes might represent an ultimate state of plasmatocyte differentiation  <cit>  further evidence suggests that they derive only from lymph gland progenitors  <cit> . yet this view has been recently challenged as cells from the sessile islands were shown to differentiate into lamellocytes after wasp infection  <cit> .

interfering with normal blood cell development and/or function can trigger an aberrant immune response characterized by lymph gland overgrowth and massive differentiation of lamellocytes  <cit> . this response culminates with the premature disintegration of the lymph gland and the formation in the larvae of "melanotic tumors"  constituted by melanized aggregates of hemocytes, mostly lamellocytes, sometimes surrounding cells from other tissues. melanotic masses are easily observable through the larval cuticle and a large number of « melanotic tumor suppressor genes », were identified based on such phenotype  <cit> . unfortunately, the nature of the mutated gene has not been ascertained in the majority of the cases and the contribution of blood cells to the phenotype has seldom been evaluated  <cit> . notwithstanding, available evidences suggest that presence of melanotic tumors reflects defects in the hematopoietic developmental program and/or in the immune surveillance of self-tissues. accordingly, melanotic mutations have been classically subdivided in two categories  <cit> :  class i mutations modify a non-hematopoietic tissue and induce a kind of "autoimmune response", as the mutations in kurtz or spaghetti  <cit> ,  class ii mutations affect internal regulatory pathways within the hemocytes themselves, such as gain of function mutations in jak/stat or toll signaling pathway  <cit> . hence, melanotic tumor suppressor genes are potential candidates for regulating both hematopoiesis and blood cell function.

in this work, we conducted a large-scale screen for melanotic tumor suppressor genes aimed specifically at the identification of genes involved in blood cell homeostasis, taking advantage of recently developed uas-dsrna transgenic line collections. down-regulation of the targeted genes was specifically induced in the blood cells or both in the blood cells and the fat body using different gal <dig> drivers. by individually inactivating the function of around 10% of the drosophila genes, we recovered  <dig> melanotic tumor suppressor genes. this approach allowed us to pinpoint several new pathways controlling blood cell homeostasis. by analyzing some of these candidates, we further demonstrate that melanotic masses can be induced by defects in a specific subset of cells and demonstrate that embryonic-derived plasmatocytes can differentiate into lamellocytes.

RESULTS
a loss of function screen for melanotic tumor suppressor genes
to identify new genes regulating drosophila blood cell homeostasis, we performed a screen for melanotic tumor suppressor genes . for this, we used of a collection of rnai transgenes  that consist of short gene fragments  cloned as inverted repeats and expressed via the binary gal4/uas system http://www.shigen.nig.ac.fly/nigfly, thus allowing tissue-specific gene knock-down. we took advantage of this collection to induce rnai in blood cells using three different drivers: srp-gal <dig>  cg-gal <dig>  and hmlΔ-gal <dig>  <cit> . spr-gal <dig> is expressed in all the embryo-derived hemocytes from the early embryonic stages, as well as in the larval lymph gland and fat body  <cit> . cg-gal <dig> is expressed in the plasmatocytes both in the late embryo and in the larvae, including in the lymph gland cortical zone, and also drives at high levels in the larval fat body  <cit> . hmlΔ-gal <dig> is expressed only at the larval stages, in almost all the circulating blood cells and in the cortical zone of the lymph gland  <cit> . all together these three drivers, whose expression patterns are illustrated in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  allow targeting most of the tissues involved in hematopoietic development and cellular immunity in drosophila.

based on pilot experiments, our screen was first performed with srp-gal <dig> and hmlΔ-gal <dig> on uas-dsrna transgenes predicted to target  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted protein-coding genes of drosophila  . all the hits were subsequently retested with the three drivers on a higher number of larvae. given that all together  <dig> % of the ±  <dig> larvae that we screened had melanotic nodules, we selected as positives only those lines that scored two folds above this baseline, i.e. with a tumor index ≥5% . thereby we identified  <dig> genes whose rnai-induced down-regulation with one of the three drivers induced melanotic masses in at least 5% of the emerging larvae . interestingly four of these genes  were already known to be implicated in melanotic mass formation and/or lamellocyte differentiation  <cit> , thereby validating our screening strategy. figure 1b displays some representative larvae harboring melanotic tumors that we obtained in the screen. we did not consider melanotic spots  as genuine melanotic tumors since they were shown to arise independently of a modification in larval blood cell homeostasis  <cit> . while smaller nodules were circulating freely in the hemocel, larger ones were most often localized to the posterior part of the larvae. in some rare cases, we observed lymph gland melanization or disintegration of the fat body . moreover, for a given gene, the penetrance of the phenotype is largely dependent on the gal <dig> line . indeed, the median tumor index for the  <dig> candidates was  <dig> % with hmlΔ-gal <dig>  9% with srp-gal <dig> and 19% with cg-gal <dig>  of note, cg-gal <dig> also caused severe growth delay or lethality before the third instar larval stage with a few candidates, which impaired the analysis of melanotic mass formation in such cases and excluded its use in the screen first step .

validation of the candidates
expression of long double stranded rna can cause non-specific phenotypes due to off-target effects   <cit> . a common measure of dsrna targeting specificity is the specificity score, s <dig>  which is the number of all on-target 19-mer matches divided by the total number of matches of a given rnai hairpin  <cit> . among the candidates we isolated,  <dig> of the  <dig> hairpins tested had no predicted off-target ,  <dig> had a s <dig> above  <dig> ,  <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and  <dig> below  <dig> , suggesting that the vast majority of the dsrna we used were specific . besides ote, another potential source of false positives is the dsrna transgene insertion itself, which might interfere with expression of nearby genes and produce melanotic nodules. to validate our hits, we obtained independent secondary uas-dsrna lines for the entire set of candidate genes, except two for which no secondary lines were available: cactus, a negative regulator of the toll pathway well known as a melanotic tumor suppressor gene  <cit> , and cg <dig>  which codes for an abcg transporter. of note,  <dig> of these  <dig> secondary uas-dsrna targeted a non-overlapping sequence in the candidate gene mrna as compared to the original set . using these secondary rnai lines, we could phenocopy formation of melanotic masses for  <dig> genes, including  <dig> of them  using non-overlapping dsrna . among the  <dig> genes where overlapping dsrna were used, mutant alleles for two of them induced melanotic tumor formation  and  <dig> code for proteins that interact with an other melanotic suppressors validated by non-overlapping dsrna or genetic means . as for the  <dig> remaining genes in that category , we cannot exclude an off-target effect although dsrna lines targeting cg <dig>  cg <dig> and fne have an s <dig> score of  <dig> and above  <dig>  for cg <dig> and cp7fa. hence, together with cactus, our screen allowed us to identify  <dig> genes potentially controlling larval blood cell homeostasis.

we also sought to validate these candidates by checking the phenotypes of genetic mutants affecting their activity. however, in most cases, no mutants have been described for these genes or the available mutations result in lethality before the third instar larval stage, thereby precluding this kind of analysis. nonetheless, beside the already described mutations in cactus  <cit> , we could confirm presence of melanotic nodules in larvae carrying zygotic mutations for five genes: u-shaped   <cit> , pyramus, rfc <dig>  tiggrin and aos <dig> . these results support the idea that the use of uas-dsrna allows efficient identification of a large panel of genes participating in blood cell development.

identification of gene networks controlling blood cell homeostasis
to gain insights into the putative functions of the candidate genes and into the different pathways regulating blood cell homeostasis, we built an interaction network between the candidates. accordingly, we searched for high confidence yeast two-hybrid, biochemical or genetic interactions data using various databases  as well as manual text mining for each of the  <dig> genes and their mammalian or yeast orthologs. we only considered first order  and second order  interactions between genes contained in our hit list or previously identified as melanotic tumor suppressors. this approach allowed us to uncover several nodes of interactions between them  as  <dig> of the candidates are linked to at least one other gene in the network. interestingly,  <dig> of the candidate genes code for proteins that are part of complexes with previously described melanotic tumor suppressors, thereby confirming that they are genuine melanotic tumor suppressor genes. namely, these  <dig> genes code for the cytoplasmic ribosomal constituents rpl <dig>  rpl <dig> and rps5b, which associate with rps <dig>  <cit> , the mitochondrial ribosomal constituents mrpl <dig>  mrpl <dig>  mrpl <dig> and mrps <dig>  which bind to mrpl <dig>  <cit> , the cop <dig> signalosome component csn1b, which associates with csn <dig> and csn <dig>  <cit> , hsp70bc and ef1α e, which are linked to hsc70- <dig>  <cit> , the replication factor rfc <dig>  which associates with rfc <dig>  <cit> , as well as wds, ldtl and cul <dig>  which bind to ddb <dig>  <cit> . in addition, it is worth noting that dref was shown to regulate the transcription of two melanotic suppressors, ddb <dig> and rfc <dig>  in cell culture  <cit> . finally, several candidates are indirectly connected to such melanotic suppressors. for instance, the translation factors , ef1γ and erf1) or the factors involved in ribosome assembly g <dig>  rrp <dig> and ppan) are functionally linked to rps <dig> function.

given that our screen allowed identification of several sets of interconnected genes, we asked whether conversely known partners of the genes we identified also behave as melanotic tumor suppressor genes. as a root, we chose cct <dig>  a component of the well defined and evolutionarily conserved chaperonin complex tric/cct   <cit> , which had not been linked to melanotic mass development before. the cct complex is composed of eight subunits  and is a cytosolic chaperonin complex regulating protein folding. we obtained uas-dsrna lines against  <dig> other cct subunits  and tested their capacity to induce melanotic nodules upon expression under the control of the three hematopoietic drivers used in the screen. as summarized table  <dig>  downregulation of any of the six cct components tested induced melanotic masses. these results show that the cct complex plays a pivotal role in regulating larval blood cell homeostasis and indicate that the different candidates from the screen can be used as entry points to explore the network of genes implicated in melanotic mass formation.

melanotic masses indices:  < 5%;  5-10%;  10-20%;  20-50%;  > 50%.

a dead second and third instar larvae were observed and no or only few adults emerged.

for further analysis of melanotic tumor formation process, we focused our attention on  <dig> genes that induced melanotic mass to high frequency and might represent different classes of melanotic tumor suppressor genes: cct <dig>  cul <dig>  hyx, mrps <dig> and ush.

melanotic masses are associated to lamellocyte production and premature lymph gland differentiation
to confirm that the melanotic masses we observed arise from a modification in larval blood cell homeostasis, we bled larvae expressing dsrna for cct <dig>  cul <dig>  hyx, mrps <dig> and ush and looked for lamellocyte differentiation. figure  <dig> shows representative bleeds obtained from third instar larvae expressing the indicated dsrna under the control of srp-gal <dig> . lamellocytes are normally absent in healthy larvae and can be easily distinguished from other blood cell types based on their morphology  and the expression of high levels of actin as well as specific markers such as msn-lacz and α-ps <dig>  <cit> . phalloidin staining and morphological examination of larval blood smears showed that all the larvae with melanotic nodules contained numerous lamellocytes in circulation, whereas this blood cell type was scarcely found in wild type controls. as expected, msn-lacz was strongly expressed in the induced population of lamellocytes. in addition, we observed a reproducible, albeit weaker, expression of msn-lacz in smaller blood cells unveiling a β-gal+ population that is not present in wild type larvae. these results suggest that melanotic tumor formation is also associated to the activation of msn-lacz in plasmatocytes or in circulating lamellocyte progenitors . finally, analysis of the melanotic masses themselves confirmed that they contained numerous lamellocytes .

we also monitored lymph gland differentiation status. consistent with previous reports, we observed precocious disintegration of the lymph gland in most larvae harboring melanotic masses. by collecting larvae without macroscopically apparent or with smaller nodules, we were able to recover intact lymph gland and found that, contrary to wild type, larvae expressing uas-dsrna contained lamellocytes in their lymph glands, as revealed by in situ hybridization against α-ps <dig> . in addition, tepiv staining revealed that the medullary zone, which contains stem-like blood progenitors, was markedly reduced or absent . thus, similar to wasp-egg parasitization  <cit> , dsrna-induced capsule formation affect larval blood cell homeostasis by activating lamellocyte development and premature differentiation of lymph gland prohemocytes.

melanotic capsule formation is induced in response to defect in specific tissues
the three gal <dig> drivers we used in our screen are predominantly expressed in blood cells, but they are also expressed in other territories  and in overlapping patterns within the hematopoietic lineages . we thus asked whether melanotic nodule formation reflected a general response to a defect in any tissue or was directly elicited by the modification of a  blood cell type. to investigate this issue, we used a battery of gal <dig> lines that are either not expressed in hematopoietic tissues  or in restricted hematopoietic compartments , or in overlapping patterns with the previous drivers  . these different drivers were used to assess through which cell type the targeted loss of cct <dig>  cul <dig>  hyx, mrps <dig> or ush can induce melanotic tumors.

cns: central nervous system, hg: hindgut, pns: peripheral nervous sytem, cz: cortical zone, eh: embryonic hemocytes; fb: fat body, gc: glial cells, lh: larval hemocytes, lg: lymph gland, mz: medullary zone, wd: wing disc. - / -: absence of melanotic masses or lamellocytes;+ /+: presence of melanotic masses and lamellocytes; - / +: rare melanotic masses but presence of lamellocytes.

we could induce both melanotic nodules and lamellocyte differentiation by targeting cul <dig> or cct <dig> dsrna specifically in the lymph gland prohemocytes with the tepiv-gal <dig> line , indicating that these genes may participate in blood cell progenitor fate maintenance and/or restrict their differentiation potential. interestingly, targeting dsrna expression only in plasmatocytes during embryogenesis either with sn-gal <dig>  or gcm-gal <dig>  <cit>   induced lamellocyte differentiation and melanotic mass formation in the case of ush, hyx, cct <dig> and cul <dig>  therefore, loss of function restricted to embryo-derived plasmatocytes or to lymph gland prohemocytes is sufficient to induce these phenotypes.

in addition we observed melanotic mass formation and lamellocyte differentiation upon expression of the dsrna against mrps <dig> or cul <dig> specifically in the fat body using the fb-gal <dig> line . however, induction of melanotic tumors or lamellocytes was never observed for any of the five genes when dsrna were expressed under the control of ms <dig>  repo-gal <dig>  elav-gal <dig> or cad-gal <dig>  which respectively drive expression in the wing discs, the glial cells, the central nervous system and the gut. thus gene knock down in the fat body, which plays a key role in innate immune response, can elicit a non-autonomous cellular immune response that culminates with the formation of melanotic nodules by the hemocytes. these results also show that the genes we tested act as melanotic tumor suppressors only in the immune system  and not in other tissues, perhaps reflecting that only immune tissues can elicit melanotic capsule formation .

all together, it appears that there are at least three different means of inducing melanotic mass formation: affecting the fat body, impinging on prohemocyte development or modifying differentiated blood cells.

embryo-derived plasmatocytes can cell autonomously differentiate into lamellocytes
the fact that some of the genes we recovered in the screen induced melanotic mass formation and lamellocyte differentiation when they were knocked-down specifically in embryonic plasmatocytes raised several questions. in particular we wondered whether these genes knock-downs provoked a cell-autonomous transformation of embryo-derived plasmatocytes into lamellocytes. alternatively, these knock-downs might non-autonomously induce lamellocyte differentiation in the lymph gland. to test these possibilities, we monitored the fate of embryo-derived hemocytes that expressed the uas-dsrna as compared to that of the lymph gland-derived hemocytes. accordingly, we used the flip-out technique to permanently label embryonic plasmatocytes and follow their fate in larval stages. flies carrying the embryonic-specific plasmatocyte drivers sn-gal <dig> or gcm-gal <dig> recombined with a uas-flp were crossed to a strain bearing a flip-out cassette  and a uas-gfp. this technique allowed us to recover gfp-expressing circulating blood cells in third instar larvae in wild type conditions, whereas gfp-expressing cells were never observed in the absence of uas-flp . labeling with the plasmatocyte-specific marker p1/nimc <dig> confirmed that these cells were plasmatocytes . of note, probably due to the limited efficiency of the flip-frt recombination, only a fraction of the blood cells was gfp+. also, sn-gal <dig> reproducibly gave higher frequency of gfp+ cells than gcm-gal <dig>  importantly, we never observed gfp+ cells in the lymph glands demonstrating that these drivers are not sporadically expressed in this compartment during larval development and that embryo-derived plasmatocytes do not normally enter the lymph gland .

we then made use of this technique to label the cells expressing a dsrna targeting ush. as reported above , expression of ush dsrna under the control of gcm-gal <dig> or sn-gal <dig> was sufficient to induce the differentiation of lamellocytes in circulation, as revealed by in situ hybridization against α-ps <dig> and morphological analysis . in the absence of flipase, no gfp+ cells were observed in circulation or in the lymph gland, indicating that these two drivers are not re-activated upon lamellocyte differentiation . strikingly, we observed gfp+ lamellocytes in circulation in the presence of flipase  and these gfp+ cells were also recovered in larvae with intact lymph glands. therefore ush loss of function is sufficient to induce the cell autonomous transformation of embryo-derived plasmatocytes into lamellocytes. in addition, while gcm-gal4-driven ush dsrna induced lamellocyte production in circulation but not in the lymph gland , we observed lamellocyte differentiation in both compartments using sn-gal <dig> . again, none of the lamellocytes in the lymph gland were gfp+, indicating that they do not arise from sn-gal4-expressing blood cells. this indicates that embryo-derived plasmatocytes participate in the production of lamellocytes both through cell autonomous and non-autonomous processes. since sn-gal <dig> gave rise to more gfp+ cells than gcm-gal <dig>  it is possible that the non-autonomous induction of lamellocytes in the lymph gland is elicited in response to a threshold level of signalization by circulating hemocytes. to assess whether embryo-derived plasmatocytes also give rise to lamellocytes upon a natural immune challenge, we infected wild type larvae with eggs from the parasitoid wasp l. boulardi. as shown figure 5q-t, wasp infection induced lamellocyte differentiation and flip-out analysis showed that some of these lamellocytes are derived from cells that had expressed gcm-gal <dig> or sn-gal <dig>  thus, we conclude that embryo-derived plasmatocytes can differentiate into lamellocytes both upon intrinsic modification of the blood cell developmental program or in response to parasitoid infection.

to get further insights into the lamellocyte differentiation process induced by melanotic tumor suppressor genes or wasp infection, we analyzed circulating blood cell differentiation status by monitoring the expression of the plasmatocyte-specific marker p1/nimc <dig> and the lamellocyte-specific marker msn-lacz. in control larvae, most blood cells expressed p1/nimc <dig> and only background β-gal staining was detected . on the contrary, in third instar larvae expressing dsrna against ush or cul <dig> under the control of srp-gal <dig>  msn-lacz was expressed in most hemocytes . interestingly, a large fraction of these β-gal+ hemocytes also expressed p <dig>  albeit often at lower levels. similarly,  <dig> h after infection by l. boulardi, we found that most p1+ cells also expressed msn-lacz . however, cells expressing both markers were rare  <dig> h after infestation: almost all the β-gal+ cells corresponded to typical lamellocytes with large flattened morphology, big nuclei and no p <dig> staining, whereas p1+ hemocytes had the characteristic small and round morphology of plasmatocytes . thus, together with the above results, these data suggest that lamellocyte differentiate from plasmatocytes via a stepwise process implicating activation of msn-lacz, change in cell morphology and repression of p <dig> expression.

discussion
in this study we have conducted a loss of function screen to identify factors that regulate drosophila blood cell development and/or function. thus far, screens aiming at uncovering genes controlling hemocyte development relied primarily on the use of zygotic mutants potentially acting in other tissues  or on misexpression of factors potentially not expressed in blood cells  <cit> . likewise, the conclusion that a given melanotic suppressor gene was specifically affecting blood cells rather than an other tissue was based mostly on the targeted expression of dominant negative   <cit> , rescue experiments   <cit> , or other indirect evidences   <cit> . to target more specifically genes expressed in hemocytes and to be able to study genes required for embryonic or early larval viability, we choose a tissue-specific loss of function approach that relied on the use of a collection of uas-dsrna transgenic lines and of three different gal <dig> drivers expressed in the hemocytes. to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such cell-targeted loss of function approach is used to identify new regulators of blood cell function and development.

by screening  <dig> genes by rna interference, we recovered  <dig> candidate melanotic tumor suppressor genes among which  <dig> were confirmed with secondary rnai lines and/or by genetic means. this corresponds to a hit rate of  <dig> % . for comparison, a recent genome wide rnai screen for genes involved in intestinal pathogenic bacterial infection resulted in  <dig> % of hits  <cit> , while a gain of function screen in larval hemocytes led to  <dig> % of hits  <cit> . yet, in neither case a systematic validation of the candidates was carried out. in a genome-wide rnai screen for genes affecting adult thorax development   <cit> , 63% of the  <dig> candidates retested with secondary rnai lines were confirmed, which is similar to our confirmation rate . since in 31% of the cases, the primary and secondary rnai lines targeted overlapping sequences, we cannot rule out that some of the melanotic masses might be caused by off-target effects. the analysis of the expression pattern of the candidates and of the rnai efficiency might help resolving this issue. interestingly though, data mining showed that most of the confirmed genes are functionally connected to one another or to a previously identified melanotic suppressor, further substantiating our conclusion that they work in a common process. thus, altogether, this screen allowed us to find  <dig> genes that likely contribute to larval blood cell homeostasis, among which  <dig> had not been directly associated with blood cell development or function before.

in contrast to the customary partition of the melanotic tumor suppressor into class i/ class ii genes  <cit> , we propose that the capacity to elicit melanotic mass development is restricted to the blood cells and the fat body . indeed, none of the candidates we tested induced lamellocytes or melanotic masses when knocked-down in other territories. similarly, knocking down the melanotic tumor suppressors ddb <dig> or dref by rnai in several non-immune tissues did not induce melanotic masses  <cit> , and hoptuml or a dominant negative form of gcm induced melanotic masses when ectopically expressed respectively in blood cells or in the fat body, but not in other tissues  <cit> . all together, there is no strong evidence that melanotic capsule can arise from genetic defects outside the hematopoietic system or the fat body. indeed, the rare "class i" mutations that have been studied  have been shown to affect fat body integrity  <cit> . while our results demonstrate for the first time that fat body-specific loss of function can cause lamellocyte differentiation and melanotic mass production, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. the fat body may be a specific source of signaling molecules that activate lamellocyte differentiation or more generally control hemocyte differentiation. conversely, several lines of evidence show that hemocytes can signal to the fat body to regulate the humoral immune response  <cit> . this cross talk between the fat body and the hematopoietic system is likely to play a crucial role in coordinating the cellular and humoral immune response to ensure efficient defense of the organism.

our results show that, within the hematopoietic system, loss of function in larval lymph gland prohemocytes, in differentiated larval blood cells or in embryonic plasmatocytes is sufficient to induce melanotic masses in the larvae. the only resilient blood cell type seemed to be the crystal cells, as we never observed nodules or lamellocytes induction with the lz-gal <dig> driver, even by overexpressing with this driver the two paradigmatic melanotic tumor inducers toll10b and hoptum . thus melanotic tumor formation can serve as a read out to identify genes potentially controlling several steps of blood cell development. for instance, it may help defining the gene regulatory network that control the maintenance of a pool of stem-like blood cells in the lymph gland cortical zone  <cit> . actually, the respiratory chain component nd <dig> that we recovered in the screen, was recently shown to participate in the maintenance of these progenitors by controlling the levels of reactive oxygen species  <cit> .

an important finding that stems out of the analysis of some genes identified in the screen is that impinging on the function of embryo-derived hemocytes is sufficient to cause lamellocyte differentiation in the larvae. our cell lineage analysis demonstrates that embryo-derived plasmatocytes cell-autonomously give rise to lamellocytes in response to a genetic defect  or to wasp infection. these results are consistent with and extend the recent observation that embryo-derived hemocytes can differentiate in lamellocytes after wasp infection  <cit> . whereas markus et al. proposed that lamellocytes differentiate from hemocyte precursors  <cit> , our analysis strongly suggests that they derive from plasmatocytes through a step-wise process. in addition, we found that the presence of "mutant" embryo-derived blood cells induced non-autonomously the differentiation of lamellocytes in the lymph gland, indicating that circulating hemocytes signal to this hematopoietic organ. mutations in the ebf transcription factor collier  or in the jak/stat signaling pathway  were shown to induce precocious differentiation of the lymph gland progenitors and to suppress lamellocyte fate, strongly suggesting that lamellocyte differentiate solely in the lymph gland from a pool of progenitors  <cit> . alternatively, we propose that the posterior signaling centre may orchestrate differentiation into lamellocytes of both circulating and lymph gland blood cells. thereby, full blown lamellocyte differentiation and melanotic nodule formation would result from a cross talk between the patrolling larval blood cells and the lymph gland.

finally our result shed new light on the function of the friend of gata transcription cofactor ush, which had already been implicated in several steps of blood cell development  <cit> . consistent with our results, it was shown that hypomorphic ush zygotic mutations or the ectopic expression of a dominant negative form of ush under the control of cg-gal <dig> induced lamellocyte differentiation  <cit> . moreover, it was proposed that ush was required in the lymph gland to prevent lamellocyte differentiation in a putative plamatocyte/lamellocyte common progenitor  <cit> . yet the fate of the ush mutant cells had not been tracked. remarkably, we demonstrate here that ush function is not restricted to the lymph gland. indeed ush loss in circulating plasmatocytes during embryogenesis is sufficient to cause the cell-autonomous transformation of these cells into lamellocytes and to promote lamellocyte development in the lymph gland. thus down-regulation of ush function in the circulating larval blood cells could be an initiating event in the immune response that leads to melanotic mass formation. our results also identify ush as the first gene controlling the fate of the circulating larval blood cells and lay the basis for the analysis of the gene networks controlling this hematopoietic compartment.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we show that lamellocyte differentiation and melanotic tumor formation can be elicited specifically by defects in different immune compartments . these results shed new lights on the coordination of the cellular immune response and on blood cell lineage relationships in drosophila. notably, we demonstrate that embryo-derived plasmatocytes are plastic cells that can differentiate into lamellocytes and that ush is a key regulator of this process. finally, this work pinpoints several new genes and pathways controlling drosophila blood cell homeostasis. their identification paves the way for future experiments aiming at dissecting their mechanism of action and their interplay with other known key regulators of drosophila hematopoiesis. it is anticipated that deciphering the function of these genes in the different blood cell types will shed new light on the mechanisms controlling blood cell homeostasis and cellular immune response in drosophila and, by homology, in mammals.
