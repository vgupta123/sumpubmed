BACKGROUND
wood represents the main source for terrestrial biomass production and is a major renewable resource for the timber, paper, and bioenergy industries  <cit> . genomics approaches have been applied to explore the molecular basis of growth and development in a few forest tree species with economic relevance. transcript profiling in trees has also specifically focused on wood formation  because of the ecological significance of forest trees and the economic importance of wood  <cit> . wood formation begins from the cambium and generates wood as the end product of secondary vascular system development, which proceeds from cell division to expansion, secondary wall formation, lignification, and finally programmed cell death  <cit> . notably, identification of accumulated expressed sequence tags  and their expression pattern during wood formation has been achieved in target species for breeding, such as pinus, populus and picea <cit> .

japanese cedar  is an allogamous coniferous species that relies on wind-mediated pollen and seed dispersal, and it is one of the most important forestry tree species in japan. the japanese cedar tree has excellent attributes , and it has been used for house construction, to build wooden ships, barrels, and musical instruments, and for many products intended for daily use for hundreds of years  <cit> . more than  <dig>  japanese cedar trees have been planted throughout japan, covering an area of  <dig>  million ha and accounting for 44% of japan’s artificial forests. seventeen million seedlings are supplied as planting material for forestation every year, making this species very important for japanese forestry today, as it has been since ancient times  <cit> .

next-generation sequencing can be a more efficient approach for obtaining functional genomic information. this type of sequencing can result in high transcriptome coverage depth and facilitates the de novo assembly of transcriptomes from species where full genomes do not exist  <cit> . in addition, by simultaneously measuring the abundance of transcripts for thousands of genes with accumulated sequence information, microarray analysis promises a comprehensive understanding of regulatory gene functions and the growth and development of plants  <cit> . to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in wood formation and key targets for genetic manipulation and selection of superior wood quality, these techniques will be powerful and efficient tools  <cit> . the only molecular studies of wood formation in japanese cedar have identified large numbers of genes that are expressed in male strobili  <cit> . however, very limited genomics and functional genomics resources related to wood formation are publicly available for japanese cedar.

the first objective of this paper was to produce an extensive collection of sequenced ests found in xylem and cdna clones to support manufacture of cdna microarrays and gene discovery efforts in japanese cedar. the next goal was to elucidate a comprehensive expression profile in the growing season using these microarrays. for this purpose, we identified  <dig>  unique sequences by next-generation roche  <dig> sequencing using a non-normalized cdna library from the cambial meristem and its derivatives from japanese cedar. to gain further insight into seasonal expression patterns, a custom cdna microarray was designed from the cdna library obtained and from est data   <cit>  and was used to investigate differential gene expression in japanese cedar during wood formation.

RESULTS
microscopic observation of differentiating xylem
based on anatomical observation of the cambial zone and the differentiating xylem, the tissue underwent seasonal cycles in activity of xylem formation, including cell division, secondary wall formation and lignification, through the growing season . the cambial cells were not active in samples taken on  <dig> march. an average of only  <dig>  cambial cells was found in each radial file, significantly fewer than found in other samples collected in april , june  and august . the expanding tracheids occupied the most space in differentiating xylem in samples taken on  <dig> april. the number of these tracheids was larger on this date than in samples collected during the growing season. thus, formation of derived tracheids was most active in samples collected on  <dig> april. a few secondary wall-forming tracheids were found in some radial files. this indicated that secondary wall formation might have just been reactivated around the day of sampling. the largest number of tracheids at the stage of secondary wall formation and lignification was observed in the  <dig> june samples. the number was significantly larger than in the other samples collected . therefore, the peak activity in xylem formation, including cell differentiation and secondary wall formation, was found in the  <dig> june samples.

the number of expanding tracheids in each radial file had significantly decreased from an average of  <dig>  cells in samples taken on  <dig> june to an average of  <dig>  cells in samples taken on  <dig> august . this indicated that cell division activity in the cambial zone was lower than at earlier stages. thus, the major activities in differentiating xylem that could be observed microscopically were secondary wall formation and lignification in the samples collected in august and october.

est sequencing and de novo assembly
sequencing of cdna libraries generated a total  <dig>  raw reads, with an average length of  <dig>  bp. the size distribution of raw reads is shown in figure 2a, and a summary of sequencing and assembly results is presented in table  <dig>  after trimming the adaptors and primer sequences,  <dig>  sequences were removed due to short length, low complexity, or overall low quality scores. this cleaning and trimming step resulted in  <dig>  high-quality reads, corresponding to  <dig> % of the original raw sequence. a total of  <dig>  high-quality reads was assembled into  <dig>  contiguous sequences , and  <dig>  reads were identified as singletons . the size of contigs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, with an average length of  <dig>  bp. the distribution of contig size is shown in figure 2b. contiguous sequences were further assembled into  <dig>  isotigs. isotigs are putative transcripts constructed using the overlapping contig reads provided as input to newbler cdna assembler. the size distribution of isotigs ranged from  <dig> to over  <dig>  bp, with an average length of  <dig>  bp . more than 99% of the isotigs were over 100 bp and 50% of the assembled bases were incorporated into isotigs longer than  <dig>  bp . the coverage depth for isotigs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  contigs assembled into each isotig . the isotigs and singletons together resulted in  <dig>  unique sequences .

sequence comparison with other species
all unique sequences were searched against the sequences in the national center for biotechnology information  non-redundant protein database and the arabidopsis information resource  using a blastx algorithm e-value of 1e- <dig> . a total of  <dig>  isotigs  and  <dig>  singleton sequences  had significant blast matches at ncbi, and  <dig>  isotigs  and  <dig>  singletons  had significant blast matches at tair. when we compared our unique sequences with est sequences in the japanese cedar database  and libraries including xylem and cambium tissue from the gene index and forestgen_xylem  using a tblastx algorithm with an e-value of 1e- <dig>  we found that  <dig>   had significant blast matches at forestgen and  <dig>   to transcripts from pinus,  <dig>   from picea, and  <dig>   from populus and that  <dig>   sequences from forestgen_xylem included similar ests. the largest overlap was found for the forestgen database based on lower e-values. a larger overlap was found for other coniferous species than for broadleaf species. comparison with blast results against the forestgen and forestgen_xylem databases indicated that the unique sequences collected in this study were also covered by ests previously collected from other organs of japanese cedar . when comparing est sequences in other libraries involving xylem and cambium, though the smallest overlap was found for forestgen_xylem, most of the unique sequences overlapped those of three well-known species undergoing xylogenesis . these results clarified that the previously accumulated japanese cedar xylogenesis related ests were incomplete, whereas our data mostly coincided with ests collected from xylem and cambium in other species.

therefore, our data are expected to be a useful resource for ests related to xylem or cambium development in japanese cedar.

identifying protein families represented in sequences by pfam
the unique sequences were investigated for conserved domains using the pfam database  <cit>  to predict their function. in  <dig>  unique sequences, we found that  <dig>   of the encoded proteins were similar to members of  <dig>  pfam protein families . overall, products of  <dig>   of the transcripts from japanese cedar cambium tissue were similar to members of  <dig>  pfam families when domains of unknown function   and uncharacterized protein families   were excluded. the  <dig> most abundant protein families in cambium tissue of japanese cedar are shown in table  <dig>  the frequency of occurrence of members of these families corresponded with previous reports on japanese cedar male strobili and white spruce  <cit> .

identifying proteins according to clusters of orthologous groups  from seven eukaryotic genomes represented in sequences
the unique sequences were searched against the cog database  <cit>  using the blastx program. the sequences that showed significant similarity  with those in the database were annotated and assigned to designated functional classes. overall,  <dig>  sequences  were annotated to known sequences with designated functional classifications, and  <dig>  were similar to known genes of unknown function and unassigned sequences in the database . the most frequent functional categories for our data were “posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones ” and “general function prediction only ,” which agreed with previous reports  <cit> . on the other hand, “signal transduction mechanisms ” was the next largest category in the annotated designations of functional classification, including the function unknown  category. this feature differed from previous reports, suggesting that seasonal expression of genes specific to cambial region tissues occurs.

identification of transcription factors
transcription factors are proteins that function in controlling the expression of target genes quantitatively, temporally, and spatially  <cit> . the unique sequences we identified were annotated against the plntfdb  <cit> , a recently developed database of transcription factor families for  <dig> plant species, using the blastx program. blastx searches revealed  <dig>  unique sequences of japanese cedar with matches against arabidopsis thaliana and  <dig>  unique sequences with matches against populus trichocarpa with e-values < 1e- <dig>  of the  <dig> transcription factor families, these sequences were annotated to  <dig> in the arabidopsis genome and  <dig> in the poplar genome . the most abundant transcription factor family annotated to a. thaliana was wrky , with  <dig> unique sequences, whereas for p. trichocarpa, it was c3h , with  <dig> unique sequences. in particular, unique sequences for transcription factors associated with xylogenesis  were abundant. therefore, in future studies, it will be necessary to specify which family members are associated with xylogenesis in this species. these transcription factor features were similar to those reported for radiata pine and white spruce  <cit> .

comprehensive gene expression changes during xylem formation
in japanese cedar, physiological and anatomical alterations during cambial activity have been well investigated by anatomical observations  <cit> , but little is known about the molecular changes that occur. in order to investigate expression of genes in japanese cedar cambial tissue during xylem formation more comprehensively, we profiled transcripts at five time points during the growing season using microarray analysis. as a result, we identified  <dig>  targets that were differentially regulated during xylem formation . the differentially expressed genes clustered into  <dig> different patterns based on their kinetics of gene expression . these  <dig> patterns were divided into two expression patterns, associated with upregulation and downregulation, during xylem formation. overall, we identified  <dig>  targets that showed differential expression during the spring reactivation and the peak activity of xylem formation and  <dig>  targets that showed differential expression during decreasing cell division and cessation of growth. cluster a <dig> was the most abundantly transcribed during spring reactivation and the peak activity of xylem formation. similarly, the group consisting of abundant clusters b <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> was notably observed during decreasing cell division/cessation of growth. the sequences of all targets in each cluster were also annotated against the cog database  using the same settings as the cdna library. xylogenesis genes with well-known functions, such as in “carbohydrate transport and metabolism ,” “cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis ,” and “cytoskeleton ,” were abundant categories in cluster a <dig>  which indicated upregulation of these genes during this period. in the major group observed during decreasing cell division/cessation of growth, expressed genes related to tolerance of various conditions and to adjustment of cellular processes, such as “rna processing and modification ,” “signal transduction mechanisms ,” and “defense mechanisms ,” were abundant.

cell-cycle related genes
druart et al  <cit>  reported the expression of  <dig> homologs of aspen trees based on  <dig> core cell-cycle genes that were investigated in arabidopsis <cit> . the expression patterns did not correspond to the increasing number of dividing cambial cells during the early phase of cambial cell-cycle activation, leading to the hypothesis of posttranscriptional control of expression after cessation of growth  <cit> . similarly, we investigated the expression of arabidopsis core cell-cycle gene homologs in japanese cedar. we observed upregulation of  <dig> of  <dig> genes from march to april, which suggested that the activation of cell division and induction of cell-cycle genes are correlated in early activity during xylem formation . our findings agreed well with data from arabidopsis <cit>  and poplar, for which the expression of cdkb and cycb is regulated seasonally following a rise in temperature  <cit> . our data suggested that cambial reactivation occurred in japanese cedar between  <dig> march and  <dig> april based on anatomical observation. to prove the hypothesis of posttranscriptional control of expression after cessation of growth, we therefore harvested samples during this period.

xylogenesis genes related to phenylpropanoid metabolism
during the development of xylem tissue, primary cell wall biosynthesis, secondary wall deposition, and lignification are important fundamental processes, because of the need for maintaining biological mechanisms conferring adaptability to various environments, compressive strength and defense against pathogens. these processes are also important determinants of wood properties.

the identification and expression profiling of gene family members that are responsible for developmental lignification have been reported for p. trichocarpa, picea abies, and pinus teada <cit> . in our study, the expression of the most of these gene family members ; 4-coumarate: coa ligase ; cinnamate-4-hydroxylase ; hydroxycinnamoyl: coa shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase ; p-coumarate-3-hydroxylase ; caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase; cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase ; cinnamoyl-coa reductase ; and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase ) was induced from march to april, and then expression gradually decreased from the peak activity of xylem formation through august . the expression of these genes corresponded to our anatomical observation that the number of cambial cells rapidly increased from march to june . these observations indicate that these genes are the main transcripts in developing xylem of japanese cedar.

interestingly, enzymes in the early part of the monolignol pathway, acting between pal and 4cl, are also involved in the biosynthesis of other phenylpropanoids, like flavonoids, coumarins, and stilbene  <cit> . lignans, which are monolignol-derived dimers and oligomers involved in such processes as defense reactions, are synthesized through the same pathway  <cit> . the expression of pal <dig>  and 4cl <dig>  was upregulated during dormancy and following cessation of growth , which indicates that these enzymes could play roles in defense, such as responses to infection, wounding, drought stress and temperature change.

lignins result from the oxidative polymerization of p-hydroxycinnamyl alcohols, which can be mediated by both laccase and peroxidase  <cit> . for the  <dig> peroxidase superfamily proteins that we examined, the levels of  <dig> transcripts  increased during peak xylem formation , which corresponded to anatomical observations. the peroxidases that were induced during this period are the strongest candidates for involvement in lignin polymerization. the expression of  <dig> peroxidase superfamily proteins was upregulated during dormancy and correlated with cessation of growth . in p. abies and pinus sylvestris, high peroxidase activities have also been measured outside the growth period during late autumn, winter, and early spring  <cit> . some peroxidase genes generally respond to external stimuli such as wounding, uv-irradiation, bending stress and pathogen infection  <cit> . these previous reports suggest functions of these genes during the inactive period for the cambium.

recently, it was reported that laccase genes lac <dig> and lac <dig> contribute to constitutive lignification in an a. thaliana mutant  <cit> . expression of laccase was 4– <dig> times higher than peroxidase in developing xylem and young vertical xylem in p. abies <cit> . the induction of lac <dig>  and lac <dig>  increased rapidly at the peak activity of xylem formation in comparison to other lignification-related genes . these most highly expressed laccases are also candidates for involvement in lignin polymerization.

xylogenesis genes related to carbohydrate, cellulose, and hemicellulose metabolism
cellulose is generally the main component of the plant cell wall, and is synthesized at the plasma membrane by a large multimeric cellulose synthase  complex  <cit> . the patterns of expression for almost all expressed cellulose synthase and cellulose synthase-like  genes that were upregulated during peak activity of xylem formation are shown . of these genes, cesa <dig> , ces4/irx <dig> , cesa <dig> , cesa7/irx <dig> , and cesa8/irx <dig>  were rapidly induced from march to april, and then their expression gradually decreased from the period of peak xylem formation until cessation of growth , which corresponded with anatomical observations. interestingly, ces4/irx <dig>  cesa7/irx <dig> and cesa8/irx <dig> are required for cell-wall biosynthesis in vascular tissue of arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . similarly, orthologs identical to these three genes are involved in secondary cell-wall biosynthesis in developing xylem of wood species such as populus and pinus <cit> . these findings suggest that the functional roles of these orthologs are conserved in cell-wall synthesis of vascular tissue in herbaceous and woody dicotyldeons, monocotyledons and gymnosperms  <cit> . additionally, a membrane-bound endoglucanase, korrigan <dig> , and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, cobra , have been implicated in cellulose biosynthesis in arabidopsis <cit> . both the sequence of the orthologs and their functional roles are reportedly conserved in populus and picea <cit> . the japanese cedar homologs of kor <dig> and cob were upregulated during peak xylem formation, suggesting a conserved functional role .

hemicelluloses, including glucomannans and xyloglucans, are major components of the plant secondary cell wall. most genes related to the glucomannan/galactomannan pathway  and to synthesis of xylan -xylosidase) and xyloglucan  were induced during xylem formation, which suggests that the encoded proteins play an active role in secondary wall formation . recently, a number of genes encoding putative glycosyltransferases required for xylan synthesis or deposition have been identified in arabidopsis using knockout mutants  <cit> . the expression of most of these genes  increased during xylem formation, indicating conserved functional roles of these orthologs . xyloglucan is incorporated and modified in the cell-wall network by xyloglucan endotransglycosylases and hydrolases   <cit> . we observed  <dig> genes involved in cell-wall biosynthesis to be upregulated at peak xylem formation; however, the expression of  <dig> genes was downregulated . some xth genes are induced in dormant cambium and cold-stressed organs  <cit> . in japanese cedar, these  <dig> genes may be candidates for this functional role.

sucrose synthase  catalyzes formation of udp-glucose, the immediate substrate for cellulose biosynthesis. members of the sus gene family in many plant species are divergent in function and differentially expressed during plant development  <cit> . in pinus and populus, some sus genes showed an expression pattern identical to that of ces genes in developing xylem  <cit> . similarly, the expression of sus  was upregulated from april to june, which suggested it as a robust candidate gene for involvement in xylem formation . interestingly, all other sus genes were rapidly downregulated from march to june, and then expression gradually increased through october. sus gene activity is considered to be associated with environmental stresses, such as cold, drought and o <dig> deficiency  <cit> . we observed upregulation of these genes in march and october, months showing markedly low temperature, which suggested synthesis of cryoprotectants and responses to cold stress . additionally, because reactivation of the cambium in the spring occurs before any significant photosynthesis activity, the induction of the sus gene and various invertases indicates that sucrose catabolism generates hexose that can be metabolized via glycolysis during this period  <cit> . the reaction catalyzed by sucrose phosphate synthase  plays an important regulatory role in controlling sus genes in plants  <cit> . in hybrid poplar, an atsps transgenic hybrid has altered phenology, such as timing of leaf senescence and bud break, compared to wild type  <cit> . some invertase and sps genes also showed an expression pattern identical to that of the sus genes . in japanese cedar, these expression profiles could indicate that these genes are involved in providing an alternative source of energy and carbon skeletons in the early period of cambial reactivation in spring.

transcription factors
several transcription factor family members, such as nac, myb, zinc finger proteins, and proteins with a lim domain or a homeodomain are thought to help regulate secondary cell-wall biosynthesis  <cit> . in particular, some transcription factors of the nac and myb subfamilies are master switches in the transcriptional network for secondary cell-wall biosynthesis  <cit> . in arabidopsis, some myb genes  are significantly upregulated in expression just when xylem vessel elements actively form  <cit> . in conifers, picea  and pinus  myb genes are also involved as transcriptional regulators in lignin metabolism and/or wood formation in stem and root  <cit> . most of these myb genes are clustered in a phylogenetic tree of mybs from spruce, pinus, arabidopsis, and the nearest sequences from other species  <cit> . we found that  <dig> myb genes were upregulated during the peak activity of xylem formation . atmyb <dig>  and atmyb <dig>  were expressed preferentially; however, atmyb <dig>  was downregulated during this period. these findings suggest that the functional roles of myb <dig> and myb <dig> orthologs are conserved in cell-wall synthesis of vascular tissue in japanese cedar and other species. recent molecular and genetic studies have revealed that a subgroup of arabidopsis nac domain transcription factors  are master switches regulating a cascade of downstream transcription factors, leading to activation of secondary wall biosynthesis  <cit> . although among these nac domains, only a vnd <dig> homolog  was included on our array; its expression was moderately decreased, as with  <dig> nac family homologs  during peak xylem formation . the homologs of other cell-wall biosynthesis-related transcription factors  were induced during this time , implying that these genes could be important in regulating downstream genes.

hormonal regulation of the activity-dormancy cycle
auxin has been implicated as a key signal regulating cambial cell proliferation and cambial meristem identity  <cit> . in the cambial region, the amount of iaa varies seasonally, and rapid induction in cambial activity occurs in spring to early summer  <cit> . the iaa distribution shows a radial gradient and is most concentrated in the cambial region  <cit> . the positive correlation observed between the regions with high iaa levels and the number of cells in the same region suggests that the gradient in endogenous iaa level controls the number of cambial cells  <cit> . the expression of some auxin signaling and transport component genes , auxin response factor , and saur-like auxin-responsive protein) was upregulated in april, and then gradually decreased through october . the concentration of iaa in p. sylvestris is high at the start of cambial reactivation, declines when the number of differentiating tracheids begins to increase, and then rises as the number of cells decreases  <cit> . in japanese cedar, our results indicate that these genes are regulated early in xylem formation. auxin signaling is mediated through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in which aux/iaa proteins are degraded through scftir <dig> complexes, composed of cullin, skp <dig>  f-box protein, and rbx <dig> protein  <cit> . we observed inverse expression of these genes relative to the expression of some auxin signaling and transport component genes, suggesting that auxin signaling and transport component genes are repressed during cessation of growth.

gibberellins  act synergistically with auxin in stimulating cambial growth  <cit> . the analysis of transgenic aspen indicated that gas are required both in xylogenesis, which is likely mediated by ga signaling in the cambium, and in fiber elongation in the developing xylem  <cit> . in angiosperm trees, application of ga results in the formation of wood fibers with enhanced thickness of the inner layers of cell walls  <cit> . we found that a homolog of ga3-oxidase , implicated in the last step of ga biosynthesis, and the receptor gene gid <dig>  were moderately upregulated at peak xylem formation . the genes encoding ga biosynthetic enzymes ga20-oxidase  and ga3ox are particularly important for control of bioactive ga levels  <cit> . ga signaling operates as a derepressible system that is moderated by della-domain proteins, which are transcriptional regulators that repress ga responses  <cit> . like della-domain proteins, the homologs of rga  were expressed inversely to these genes . these findings suggest that genes involved in ga signaling have an important role in xylem formation.

abscisic acid  content increases during abiotic stress, and especially protects plant water status. in poplar cambium, aba levels are increased by short days and by short days with low temperature in late autumn and during cambial reactivation in early spring  <cit> . genes related to aba biosynthesis and signaling, such as aba <dig>  nced, cyp707a, pp2c , snrk <dig>  , abre , and pyl , were upregulated in march and october . most of these genes were rapidly downregulated from march to april, suggesting that their downregulation is coincident with release from cold hardiness and the improvement in water deficit on cambial reactivation. the arabidopsis cyp707a gene family , involved in aba catabolism, controls seed dormancy  <cit> . therefore, our observations suggest that aba is degraded during cambial reactivation in japanese cedar. in the apex of hybrid aspen, some 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid genes , which are involved in aba biosynthesis, are induced after 5 weeks of short-day treatment, which also induces growth cessation  <cit> . as seen in our data , these genes  were upregulated in accordance with changes in day length. other aba biosynthesis-related and signaling genes were also upregulated from august to october, indicating they may be induced in response to several abiotic stresses  that also lead to cessation of growth .

development of cold hardiness in activity-dormancy cycle
on  <dig> march, before cambial reactivation, cold hardiness was maintained in cambial cells . on the other hand, the number of expanding cells and cells depositing secondary walls, as well as temperature and day length, rapidly decreased from  <dig> august to  <dig> october , suggesting acquisition of cold hardiness on growth cessation. the transcriptional regulators and modulating genes involved in the acquisition of cold hardiness of japanese cedar have not been identified. in arabidopsis, the ice <dig>  and cbf  family transcription factors are respectively upstream and downstream regulators of the cold-responsive transcriptome and freezing tolerance  <cit> . the role of the cbf family as transcriptional activators in cold acclimation of arabidopsis has been maintained in populus; in particular, cfb <dig> and cfb <dig> show significant induction in populus stems  <cit> . the only ice <dig> homologs presented on our array were induced in conditions consistent with maintaining and acquiring cold hardiness  , so these genes are candidates for this functional role. druart et al.  <cit>  listed and clustered the expression pattern of genes involved in cold hardiness from three data sets:  <dig>  poplar genes induced by low temperature and atcbf overexpression;  <dig>  a poplar homolog of an arabidopsis gene induced by low temperature; and  <dig>  poplar homologs of genes involved in the development of cold hardiness in three other tree species  <cit> . we clustered the expression patterns of these genes based on their timing of induction. clustering of the  <dig> homologs of these genes yielded three main groups, two associated with autumn transition and early spring , and another with spring reactivation  . their expression rapidly decreased from march to april, which suggested repression and release of cold hardiness in cluster  <dig>  in cluster  <dig>  expression  was up- or downregulated in accordance with changes in day length. in acquisition of cold hardiness, these genes were moderately upregulated prior to reduction in temperature . this finding implies that a signal other than low temperature  must trigger the induction of these genes in autumn under natural conditions  <cit> . in cluster  <dig>  some homologs were superinduced from march to april, which corresponded to previous findings  <cit> . the exact role of this superinduction is unclear; however, it might reflect a need to protect the very sensitive dividing cambial cells from sudden drops in temperature during early spring  <cit> .

because of limited photosynthesis in autumn, plants must derive the energy and carbon required for the acquisition of cold hardiness from some other source  <cit> . conversion of starch to sugar is a key metabolic process associated with the entry into dormancy, as starch-derived sugars serve several purposes, for example as cryoprotectants as well as a source of energy  <cit> . transcriptional induction of a key enzyme of the starch breakdown pathway occurs in poplar cambium in autumn and during dormancy  <cit> . our data showed that most homologs involved in the process, such as β-amylase and phosphoglucan-water dikinase, were induced in march and october . these profiles suggested them as candidate genes for regulating the availability of an alternative energy and carbon source during limitations on photosynthetic activity.

cytoskeleton-related genes
the cytoskeleton regulates cellular polarity, morphology, and movement through its involvement in cellular events such as vesicular traffic, organellar movement, abiotic and biotic stress sensing, signal transduction, and cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> . plant cell morphogenesis relies on the organization and function of two polymer arrays separated by the plasma membrane: the cortical microtubule cytoskeleton and cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall  <cit> . in the large s <dig> layer of secondary fiber cell walls, the orientation of microfibril deposition, which is directed by cortical microtubules, is an important trait determining wood quality and wood stiffness or elasticity, and is referred to in trees as the microfibril angle  <cit> . the expression of genes for α- and β-tubulins, which comprise dynamic arrays of cortical microtubules, appear to play a role in determining these characteristics during xylem development in populus and eucalyptus <cit> . our data showed that most tubulin gene family members are highly expressed during peak xylem formation . similarly, most other cytoskeleton-related genes such as actin and genes encoding actin-related or -interacting proteins , microtubule-associated protein , microtubule-motor family protein, microtubule end binding protein, and kinesin were also induced .

actin forms microfilament structures by self-polymerization and interactions with numerous actin-binding proteins. in our data, the four homologs of atact <dig>  were upregulated during peak xylem formation, along with actin-related/interacting protein and a gene encoding a kinesin family protein . the homologs clustered closely in a group with a pinus homolog in a phylogenetic tree of actin from arabidopsis and the nearest sequences from other species  <cit> . atact <dig> is preferentially expressed in younger, rapidly developing tissue, such as during germination and root growth in arabidopsis <cit> . these findings correspond with our findings in developing xylem.

the organization and dynamics of microtubules are regulated by maps <cit> . our study found a gene encoding a map  that was more strongly transcribed than other map genes . atmap65- <dig> is able to promote tubulin polymerization, enhance microtubule nucleation, and decrease the critical concentration for tubulin polymerization  <cit> ; this role agrees reasonably well with what would be expected from our expression pattern and anatomical observations.

validation of microarray expression of  <dig> selected genes by qrt-pcr
microarray expression data of  <dig> differentially transcribed genes selected in this study were validated by qrt-pcr using the same rna samples used for the microarray experiments. transcript accumulation measured by qrt-pcr was fairly consistent with the microarray results for all  <dig> validated genes , particularly in the ranking of magnitude of expression, indicating that the microarray experiments in this study were sufficiently reliable for the identification of genes that may influence xylem formation in the cambium of japanese cedar.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we obtained  <dig>  unique sequences by sequencing a non-normalized cdna library from the cambial meristem and derivative cells of japanese cedar. a custom cdna microarray was designed based on this library and est data to investigate seasonal gene expression in japanese cedar. this is the first comprehensive study of an extensive collection of est sequences and expression studies related to xylem formation in japanese cedar. because japanese cedar belongs to a different lineage than the pinaceae, comparison of data could lead to significant findings on genome evolution in coniferous species. our data may also be a useful resource for forward genetics and functional genetics studies in wood species.
