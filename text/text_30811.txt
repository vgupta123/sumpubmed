BACKGROUND
castor bean  is an important non-edible oilseed crop and its seed derivatives are often used in aviation oil, lubricants, nylon, dyes, inks, soaps, adhesive and biodiesel. among all the vegetable oils, castor bean oil is distinctive due to its high level of ricinoleic acid , a fatty acid consisting of  <dig> carbons, a double bond between c <dig> and c <dig>  and a hydroxyl group attached to c <dig>  ricinoleic acid is responsible for castor bean oil interest, with the highest and most stable viscosity index among all the vegetable oils combined with high lubricity, especially under low-temperature conditions. although it was found that castor bean seeds had been used by people dating from about  <dig> bc  <cit> , it is still an unanswered question about the origin of castor bean cultivation. castor bean's contemporary distribution in the warmer regions is worldwide, although its origin is obscured by wide dissemination in ancient times and the ease and rapidity with which it becomes established. castor bean is indigenous to southeastern mediterranean basin, eastern africa, and india, and most probably originated in tropical africa  <cit> . because of its high economic value, castor bean is widely cultivated in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate countries, particularly india, china and brazil  <cit> . due to increased demand for castor bean in many countries, breeding and improvement of varieties are drawing great attention from breeders  <cit> .

although the genus ricinus is considered monotypic, castor bean varies greatly in its growth habit, color of foliage and stems, seed size and oil content  <cit> . most types are large perennials that often develop into small trees in tropical or subtropical areas; however it is usually shorter and smaller and grown annually in areas prone to frost. it is obvious that castor bean exhibits great phenotypic diversity and phenotypic plasticity to environmental factors. however, little is known about castor bean's genetic diversity and the genetic basis of its phenotypic plasticity. castor bean is usually considered to be both self- and cross-pollinated by wind, but controlled crossing studies suggest that outcrossing is a frequent mode of reproduction  <cit> .

germplasm collections constitute one of the world's most readily available sources of plant genetic material  <cit> . the usda-ars plant genetic resources conservation unit  collected and maintained diverse germplasm resources of castor bean worldwide, which provided valuable germplasms for castor bean breeding and improvement of varieties. there is an increasing need for distinguishing the varieties reliably, establishing their purity, and fingerprinting released varieties, hybrids and the parental lines of castor bean germplasm held in different countries by efficient molecular markers during breeding and improvement of varieties. most cultivars have low productivity. the castor bean seed, meanwhile, contains the highly toxic protein ricin which seriously limits its usage. the main goal of breeding and improvement of varieties to breeders is to develop high-productivity and nontoxic varieties of castor bean. developing robust and reliable molecular markers associated with traits of interest will enhance the breeding program efficiency.

simple sequence repeats  or microsatellites showing extensive length polymorphisms have been widely used in dna fingerprinting, genetic diversity studies, construction of genetic linkage map and breeding applications  <cit> . previous studies of genetic diversity suggested that ssrs are more informative and robust than other available molecular marker resources, such as amplified fragment length polymorphism  and random amplified polymorphic dna  in castor bean  <cit> . in particular, ssr markers are readily transferable between laboratories as each locus is defined by the primer sequence. ssrs can be used not only for identifying cultivars but also for genetic mapping and marker-assisted selection  <cit> . development of ssr markers specific to castor bean is critical and should be a priority for assisting in the breeding and improvement of varieties  <cit> . the ssr markers of castor bean are, however, very limited to date because the de novo development of ssrs is a costly and time consuming endeavor  <cit> . the advent of modern genomics age has produced large amounts of publicly available dna sequence data. in particular, the expressed sequence tags  provide a valuable resource for identifying and developing gene-associated ssr markers. linkage of est-ssr markers with desired characters may lead to the identification of genes controlling these traits  <cit> . in addition, est-ssrs are universal and can be applied in comparative mapping and linkage map construction  <cit> . therefore, in recent years, est-ssrs have already been developed for various crops such as wheat and rice  <cit> , barley  <cit> , grape  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , sugar cane  <cit> , coffee  <cit> , oil palm  <cit>  and rubber tree  <cit> .

to our knowledge, there has been no report of development of est-ssr markers in castor bean to date. therefore, we report our work on est-ssrs derived from castor bean ests in the national centre of bioinformatics information, usa database, based on  the frequency and distribution of ssrs in castor bean ests,  the establishment and validation of est-ssr markers for detection of polymorphism in castor bean, and  the assessment of genetic relationships among  <dig> germplasm accessions collected from main diversity centers of castor bean by using est-ssr markers developed. these rich ssr resources from castor bean est database are publicly available and the polymorphic est-ssr markers reported herein would be particularly useful for genetic map-based analyses as well as population genetic studies, facilitating breeding and crop improvement of castor bean.

RESULTS
frequency and distribution of microsatellites
a total of  <dig>  non-redundant castor bean est sequences trimmed were identified from  <dig>  publicly available est sequences by running the est-trimmer and the cd-hit programs. the search for microsatellites in  <dig>  non-redundant castor bean ests representing approximately  <dig>  mb revealed  <dig>  microsatellites in  <dig>  ests; nearly one in  <dig>  unique ests  contained at least one ssr;  <dig>  ests contained more than one ssr and  <dig> ssrs were found as compound ssrs. this corresponds to an average distance between ssrs of approximately  <dig>  kb  or one ssr-containing est every  <dig>  ests. the ssrs identified contained  <dig> di-,  <dig> tri-,  <dig> tetra-,  <dig> penta-,  <dig> hexa-, and  <dig> mononucleotides . the trinucleotides are the dominant motifs . among motif repeats,  <dig> a/t repeats accounting for  <dig> % of total mononucleotide repeats  were the dominant mono- motifs;  <dig> ag/ct repeat accounting for  <dig> % of total dinucleotide repeats  are the dominant di- motifs. however, the trinucleotide motifs were relatively diverse with  <dig> aag/ctt, the richest repeat among tri- motifs, accounting for  <dig> % of total trinucleotide motifs . similarly, there were no obvious dominant motifs among the tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide motifs.

* the motif with less  <dig> ssr was not listed.

inspection of ssr location on est sequences showed that  <dig> mono- repeats ,  <dig> di- repeats ,  <dig> tetra- repeats , and  <dig> penta- repeats  occurred within un-translated regions , while  <dig> tri- repeats  and  <dig> hexa- repeats  occurred within expression regions .

polymorphism and genera transferability of est-ssrs markers
out of  <dig> ssr embedded within  <dig> ests, excluding  <dig> mnrs, primer pairs could be designed for  <dig> ssr loci  by using primer <dig>  the remaining sequences contained either too little dna sequence flanking the ssr loci or the sequences were inappropriate for primer modeling. three hundred and seventy-nine primer pairs flanking  <dig> di-nucleotide repeats ,  <dig> tri-nucleotide repeats ,  <dig> tetra-nucleotide repeats ,  <dig> penta- nucleotide repeats  and  <dig> hexa-nucleotide repeats  were assayed to test the polymorphism and genera transferability of est-ssrs in  <dig> accessions worldwide . in  <dig>  cases, pcr products could be amplified with genomic dna, while for  <dig> primer pairs pcr completely failed, amplified too weakly, or amplified multiple bands and the  <dig> primers were excluded from further analysis . in  <dig> cases, the amplicons obtained were of obviously larger size than expected from the est sequence, probably due to the presence of introns. the amplification of introns may cause problems, since fragments above  <dig> bp could not be scored accurately for small differences in fragment size. additionally, it can be assumed that in several cases the observed polymorphism is caused by a size polymorphism within the intron, which may overshadow a putative polymorphism of the microsatellite. thus the  <dig> primer pairs containing obvious introns and producing over  <dig> bp fragments were also excluded from further analyses. one hundred and sixty-nine primer pairs were monomorphic, covering  <dig> di- motif loci,  <dig> tri- motif loci and  <dig> tetra- motif loci. in total,  <dig> polymorphic est-ssr markers from  <dig> primer pairs were identified, including  <dig> di- motif loci,  <dig> tri- motif loci and  <dig> tetra- motif loci . the proportion of polymorphic primers was  <dig> %. the polymorphic proportion of di-, tri-, and tetra- motif loci were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and 47%, respectively. from the  <dig> loci we identified  <dig> alleles with an average of  <dig>  alleles per locus . of the  <dig> alleles,  <dig> alleles were from di- loci with an average of  <dig>  per locus,  <dig> alleles were from tri- loci with an average of  <dig>  per locus. across  <dig> loci, gene diversity  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . among  <dig> dinucleotide loci and  <dig> trinucleotide loci, the mean of he were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. across dinucleotide and trinucleotide loci, dinucleotide ssrs were significantly more polymorphic than trinucleotide ssrs . across  <dig> loci, pic values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , suggesting the est-ssr markers developed had moderate level of polymorphism. blast analyses showed that  <dig> est sequences from the developed  <dig> polymorphic ssr markers shared significant homology to arabidopsis loci. the functional annotations of markers developed were listed in table s <dig> .

to test the genera transferability of est-ssrs identified in castor bean to jatropha curcas and speranskia cantonensis, the  <dig> primer pairs, which could successfully amplify pcr products in castor bean were tested for amplification of the genomic dna of j. curcas and s. cantonensis with the same pcr conditions used in castor bean.  <dig> of  <dig>  primer pairs amplified in s. cantonensis, and  <dig> of  <dig>  primer pairs amplified in j. curcas .

genetic relationships among germplasms
a dendrogram based on upgma nei-li's criteria was generated with five distinct clusters . cluster i included two african  and two south american  accessions; cluster ii contained one african , one russian , and two west asian  accessions; cluster iii comprised of one north american  and two indian  accessions; cluster iv covered all chinese  and vietnam  accessions. the dendrogram based on neighbor-joining criteria was very similar to the upgma tree, and the five distinct clusters  were again identified, though there were slight differences in branch length within clusters .

discussion
ssr frequency and distribution
the non-redundant est sequences provided a more accurate representation of the densities of ssr motifs in the transcribed portions of the genome  <cit> . based on the  <dig>  non-redundant castor est sequences,  <dig> ssrs were identified. the overall density of ssrs is one ssr per  <dig>  kb, nearly one in  <dig>  unique ests . using the same cut-off criteria, ellis and burke inspected the frequency of est-ssrs from  <dig> plant genera and found that the frequency varied from one in every  <dig> unique ests  to one in every  <dig> unique ests , with a mean frequency of nearly one ssr-ests in every  <dig> unique ests   <cit> . compared to the  <dig> plant genera, castor exhibits considerably high frequency of est-ssrs. to further compare the overall densities of ssrs in castor bean est sequences with that reported in other plants, we used the same cut-off criteria as cardle et al.  <cit>  with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> repeats for di-, tri-, tetra- and penta-, respectively, excluding the mono-repeats. correspondingly, we identified  <dig> ssrs with one ssr per  <dig>  kb  est sequence in castor. this density is higher than that in soybean , maize , tomato , arabidopsis , poplar , and cotton . however, it is lower than that in rice . similarly, we separately used the same cut-off criteria as aggarwal et al. used in coffee  <cit> , low et al. used in oil palm  <cit>  and feng et al. used in rubber tree  <cit> , and identified  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  ssrs  respectively, higher than that in coffee  and oil palm , and lower than that in rubber tree . varshney et al. assumed that the high frequency of ssr in rice est sequences may be due to its small genome size  <cit> . the genome size of castor was estimated to be  <dig> mb  <cit> . the high frequency ssr in castor est sequences may be related to its small genome size.

like other plants, a/t is the main mononucleotide motif in castor bean est sequence  <cit> . among the dinucleotide repeat motifs identified, ag/ct repeats  were the most common in the dataset, accounting for  <dig> % of the total dinucleotide motifs . these results are consistent with the frequency of dnrs identified in arabidopsis, rice, soybean, maize, oil palm, coffee, barley, wheat and rubber tree  <cit> . kantety et al. suggested that the high level of occurrence of ga/ct motifs could be due to the high level of occurrence of the translated amino acid products of the motifs  <cit> . the ga/ct motifs are translated into gag , aga , cuc  and ucu . we inspected the codon usage from  <dig> orfs containing  <dig>  codons in castor bean est sequences and detected  <dig>  codons for these four amino acids , accounting for that the four amino acids have a relatively higher frequency than the amino acids produced by the other dinucleotide repeats . thus, kantety et al.'s assumption was supported in our study. the cg/gc is the most rare di- repeat in accordance with that reported in other plants compared  <cit> .

varshney et al. reported that among cereal species tnrs were the most frequent  followed by dnrs  and ttnrs , excluding mnrs  <cit> . our results  are consistent with cereal species with the most frequent tnrs , followed by dnrs , and ttnrs . the abundance of trimetric ssrs in ests was attributed to the absence of frameshift mutations in coding regions when there is length variation in these ssrs  <cit> . among the tri- motifs aag/ctt is the most frequently occurring  in castor bean ests, followed by agc/gct , acc/ggt , atc/gat , aat/att . morgante et al.'s observation that aag/ctt is predominant and ccg/cgg is relatively rare tri- repeats in dicotyledonous plants  <cit>  was confirmed.

the mono-, di-, tetra- and penta- repeat loci mainly occurred within utr regions, while tri- and hexa- repeat loci occurred mainly within exon regions. this seems to be a common feature of est-ssrs and has often been found in other organisms. this could be a result of selection and evolution, since tri- and hexa- ssrs do not change the coding frame in coding regions when there is a ssr length variation, while mono-, di-, tetra- and penta- ssr easily change the coding frame within coding regions and give rise to negative mutation when the ssr length variation occurred.

polymorphism of est-ssr markers and genera transferability
hitherto, little work has been done on the development and application of ssr markers in castor bean genetic and breeding studies. we obtained  <dig> polymorphic est-ssr markers from  <dig> primer pairs within  <dig> germplasm sampled with a polymorphic ratio of  <dig> %, excluding the null allele primers and those that harbor obvious introns. compared to other plants, the polymorphic ratio of est-ssr primers in castor bean is at the medium level  <cit> . these polymorphic est-ssr markers derived herein, to our knowledge, are the first report on development of genic microsatellite markers in castor bean to date. using these  <dig> polymorphic est-ssr markers,  <dig> alleles were identified from  <dig> accessions with an average of  <dig>  alleles per marker. allan et al. reported nine genomic ssr markers with an average of  <dig>  gene diversity  and an average of  <dig>  alleles per locus  <cit> . bajay et al. developed  <dig> genomic ssr markers with an average of  <dig>  gene diversity  and an average of  <dig>  alleles per locus  <cit> . our results displayed that the gene diversity  and pic value of the  <dig> polymorphic markers were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. these results were consistent with each another, suggesting that ssr locus of castor bean represents a moderate level of gene diversity. the gene diversity values  reported herein can serve as a guide in selecting the loci that are most likely to be informative in further castor bean research.

as mentioned above, di- and tetra- ssrs mainly occurred within utr regions, while tri- ssrs mainly occurred within exon regions. unsurprisingly, di-  and tetra-  motif loci presented higher polymorphic proportions than tri- motif loci  in castor bean, suggesting that the ssrs which occurred within utr are more polymorphic than those in exon regions. across di- and tri- motif loci, di- motif markers presented significantly higher gene diversity than those of the tri- motif markers. these observations showed that the ssr loci harbored within utr regions were more polymorphic than these harbored within exon regions in castor bean.

transferability of est-ssrs among closely related genera has been reported in many crops. ellis and burke summarized the transferability of est-ssrs among plant taxa and exhibited a variation range of est-ssrs cross-genera transferability from 10% to 80%  <cit> . our results indicated that castor bean est-ssrs had a moderate transfer rate  in s. cantonensis and a relatively lower transfer rate  in j. curcas. raji et al. reported the transfer rate of est-ssr markers developed from manihot to castor bean was 15%  <cit> . the different cross-genera transferability of est-ssrs may be related to the evolutionary distance between the three genera, since castor bean phylogenetically has a more distant relationship with jatropha than speranskia and manihot  <cit> .

evaluation of genetic relationships among germplasms
as mentioned above, castor bean belongs to a monotypic genus with great phenotypic diversity and phenotypic plasticity. castor bean is a fast-growing and easily-establishing perennial shrub under various habitats, and is widespread throughout tropical and subtropical regions and is often found on wastelands today. it is difficult to establish castor bean's origin now, though it is thought to be native to the southeastern mediterranean basin, eastern africa, and india. according to moshkin, there are four main centers of genetic variability viz., irano-afghanistan-ussr region, palestine-sw asia, india-china and the arabian peninsula, each with its own specific plant characteristics  <cit> . it is an acceptable view that castor bean landraces collected from south or north america today were most likely introduced from africa or west asia in early society due to human activities.

our current research identified five distinct groups clusters i-v within  <dig> samples using the genotypes of  <dig> alleles. apparently, the five clusters lacked a geographic structure because the two south american germplasms  clustered with two african members  in cluster i, and the north american accession  clustered with two indian  members in cluster iii. however, if we assume that the two south american germplasms  and the one north american germplasm  were introduced from africa or west asia, our current research seems to support, in a way, moshkin's view  <cit> , namely, cluster i represents african members, clusters ii and iii represent irano-afghanistan-ussr and palestine-sw asia members, and clusters iv and v represent india-china members. it is noteworthy that the germplasms sampled in the current study is limited and incomplete. it remains to be determined whether this geographic pattern of germplasm group is present in a more extensive survey of germplasm samples. allan et al.'s studies  <cit>  did not identify distinct geographic groups among worldwide germplasms. the possible reasons could be that 1) the polymorphic markers used in their studies were limited, or 2) many castor bean germplasms were introduced or multi-introduced across several continents due to human activities. it may be difficult to figure out the origin and domestication of castor bean without the genotype of the wild castor bean germplasms. without a doubt, the polymorphic est-ssr markers developed herein will provide robust genetic markers for further investigation of the origin and evolution of castor bean, though the geographic structuring of castor bean germplasms detected from our current study is uncertain.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the castor bean est database harbored highly rich ssr sites and the est-ssr markers reported herein exhibited moderate levels of gene diversity. these est-ssr markers should prove useful for both genetic mapping and population structure analysis, facilitating breeding and crop improvement of castor bean.
