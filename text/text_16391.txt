BACKGROUND
through a process of post-replicative covalent modification, 5-methylcytosine is considered as a “fifth base” in mammals. 5-methylcytosine is formed by the addition of a methyl group to the 5-position of a cytosine ring and is catalyzed by dna methyltransferases 
 <cit> . the correct localization of this modification on the chromosomes is crucial for diverse biological processes, such as embryonic development, genomic imprinting and x-chromosome inactivation
 <cit> . aberrant dna methylation is associated with many human diseases, including cancers
 <cit> .

multiple methods have been developed to probe the distribution of 5-methylcytosine on a genome-wide scale. the infinium methylation  <dig> k array
 <cit> , based on quantitative genotyping of the c/t polymorphism generated by bisulfite conversion, is now widely used because of its cost-efficiency. however, its cpg coverage is limited. next generation sequencing-based methods can detect extensive genome-wide cytosine methylation. these methods can be classified into two categories. firstly, bisulfite-treatment-based approaches, including whole genome bisulfite sequencing 
 <cit> , reduced representation bisulfite sequencing 
 <cit> , and target-region capture followed by a bisulfite sequencing strategy, which we and others developed recently
 <cit> . secondly, affinity-purification-based approaches, including medip-seq
 <cit>  and mbd-seq
 <cit> . among the above-mentioned methods, wgbs has been widely used to profile dna methylation at single-base resolution genome wide; however it consumes micrograms of genomic dna at a high cost, which is not feasible for many clinical samples, such as tumors obtained by laser capture microdissection or rare stem cell populations
 <cit> . rrbs representatively interrogates dna methylation at single-nucleotide resolution in genomic regions that are especially enriched for cpg islands  and promoters. promoter-associated cgis represent important cis regulatory elements in the human genome: ~70% of annotated gene promoters are associated with a cgi
 <cit>  and about half of all cgis contain transcription start sites 
 <cit> . studies of cancer genomes also reveal that aberrant methylation of promoter-associated cgis is acquired during tumorigenesis
 <cit> . promoter-associated cgis are therefore of special interest to biomedical researchers. rrbs is the first choice for dna methylation analysis of clinical samples because of its minimal dna requirements and low cost, based on reduced representation of the genome.

however, the majority of intergenic regions and cgi shores are beyond the detection range of current rrbs strategies
 <cit> , and dna methylation in these regions also plays important roles in various biological processes. methylation of intergenic or intragenic regions has been suggested to be involved in regulating alternative splicing
 <cit>  and expression of non-coding rnas , such as mirnas and snornas in tumorigenesis
 <cit> . methylation of cgi shores might also be important as tissue-specific differential methylation regions  and cancer-specific differential methylation regions , both of which are preferentially located in cgi shores
 <cit> . furthermore, although rrbs can representatively interrogate nearly 65% of all promoters, it can only cover about 30% of the cpg dinucleotides of the promoters detected, which may not sufficiently represent their actual methylation levels
 <cit> .

based on in silico simulation of enzyme digestion on human and mouse genomes, we improved the current single-enzyme  rrbs  strategy by adding another enzyme  to interrogate more representative regions. we applied this double-enzyme strategy  to a lymphoblastoid  cell line and a mature dendritic  cell line
 <cit> , and confirmed that the cpg coverage of cgis, cgi shores, promoters and introns were considerably increased. furthermore, the average methylation levels in genomic regions varied along with increasing cpg coverage, indicating that the drrbs strategy can more accurately reflect their average methylation levels. additionally, we comprehensively characterized the dna methylation profiles of a colorectal carcinoma cell line pair 
 <cit> . as expected, genome-wide demethylation in dko cells was observed. surprisingly, we also observed that dna methylation of certain regions was maintained, suggesting a selection mechanism for cancer cells’ survival, as reported previously
 <cit> . in summary, the improved drrbs strategy will increase cpg coverage of genomic regions and improve accuracy in detecting their average methylation levels, thus aiding future methylome studies of diverse clinical samples.

RESULTS
design of the double-enzyme rrbs method
recently, two groups systematically assessed the srrbs technology and demonstrated that it is able to enrich the promoter and cgi regions
 <cit> . we further applied pair-end sequencing with a  <dig> bp read length  strategy to increase the cytosine coverage, but the proportion of detected cpg dinucleotides within other genetic elements  were still low. srrbs has several advantages 
 <cit> ; therefore, we sought to improve the technology by adding another restriction enzyme to further fragment the genome. by proper size-selection, the number of cpgs detected and the coverage of other genomic regions, such as cgi shores and introns can be further increased. we performed in silico simulation of enzyme digestion on the human genome  and the mouse genome  by mspi combined with other methylation insensitive restriction endonucleases, including hpych4v, alui, bstni, haeiii, hpych4iii, apeki, banii, bglii, taqαi, sphi, bamhi, bsssi and kpni. two different ranges of size-selection  for in silico digested dna fragments were evaluated. the interrogated cpg dinucleotides, based on  <dig> bp forward reads, were generally increased on different genomic elements by double-enzyme digestion in comparison with single-enzyme mspi digestion in both human and mouse genomes .

depending on the specific experimental requirements, researchers can select an appropriate combination of enzymes for the rrbs library construction. the recognition sites of mspi are mostly located in high-cg regions
 <cit> ; therefore, the mspi-digested dna will be further fragmented by adding an enzyme with cg inside its recognition sites; however, the genomic coverage on regions with low cg density was only slightly increased  and bsssi , additional file
1: table s1). a more representative coverage in low-cg regions can be achieved using an enzyme such as apeki, which has no cg inside its recognition site. it is clear the cost rises inline with improvement in cpg coverage; thus, considering both increased coverage and cost, we chose a combination of mspi and apeki digestion to test the feasibility of the drrbs strategy. this strategy achieves an approximately two-fold increase in cpg coverage. other combinations, such mspi and bstni, also increase cpg coverage, but with more sequencing required . moreover, the pe <dig>  sequencing strategy can cover more cpg sites than the pe <dig> sequencing strategy, based on current high-throughput platforms, such as illumina hiseq <dig>  however, the pe <dig> sequencing strategy is more cost-effective, considering the amount of data required . thus, in present study, we applied a pe <dig> sequencing strategy to generate data, which can be further excised into pe <dig> sequencing data by cutting off  <dig> bp from the sequencing reads in silico. we then systematically evaluated the cpg coverage and data requirements from different sequencing strategies of the drrbs approach.

data generation and coverage evaluation
using a double-enzyme  rrbs strategy for genome-wide dna methylation detection, we constructed sequencing libraries from the genomic dna of yh  and mdc cell lines . we then compared the sequencing results to srrbs results with 40- <dig> bp fragments digested by mspi . as a result,  <dig>  m  and  <dig>  m  uniquely aligned high-quality pe <dig> reads with an average of 10× sequencing depth were generated by drrbs, while  <dig>  m  and  <dig>  m  uniquely aligned pe <dig> reads with an average of 20× sequencing depth were generated by srrbs
 <cit>  .

to evaluate the increased coverage of cpgs in specific genomic regions caused by addition of apeki digestion, we excised the pe <dig> reads for yh generated by drrbs into  <dig> bp reads, and compared the data with srrbs. two types of measurements were applied in parallel. one approach simply counted the numbers of individual cpgs, as suggested in the original rrbs method
 <cit> . we examined different genomic regions of the yh sample, including promoters, cpg islands, cgi shores, enhancers and introns , as well as four other types of genomic region  . a considerable increase in coverage for all these regions, especially  <dig> % for promoters,  <dig> % for cpg islands,  <dig> % for cgi shores and  <dig> % for introns were detected, with more than  <dig> individual cpgs measurements , as described previously
 <cit> . the second method was to calculate and compare the percentage of cpg dinucleotides detected. as indicated in figure
1b, the coverage of total cpgs was nearly doubled  in the yh genome by pe <dig> sequencing with 40- <dig> bp size selection. accordingly, the cpg coverage within different genomic elements largely increased, especially for cgi shores and gene bodies. furthermore, applying a sequencing strategy with longer reads or choosing a wider range of size-selection of digested fragments would expand the coverage of cpg sites, as exemplified in the comparison between different strategies using the mdc sample . such scale of increased coverage might enable more accurate analysis of dmrs, not only for large regions, as exemplified by one randomly selected region across chr7: <dig> ,000- <dig> , <dig> , but also for specific genes, as exemplified by two tumor suppressor genes  with cgi and one randomly selected gene without cgi. in particular, we clearly show that drrbs detected more cpg of cgis in promoters of the tbx <dig> and irf <dig> genes than srrbs .

as the genome-wide coverage of cpg sites increased, one major concern would be whether the sequencing cost would also increase. therefore, we estimated the cost efficiency in term of reads per informative cpg measurement. for cpgs with more than 1× and 5× sequencing depth, reads per informative cpg were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, for drrbs based on the same size selection  and read length  in the yh sample. for srrbs, values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  were observed, indicating that the cost efficiency is similar between the two methods. indeed, the average sequencing depth of drrbs would be less than that for srrbs given similar amount of raw data . however, taking cpg sites with 5× and 10× sequencing depth from both drrbs and srrbs, we observed that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of additional cpgs could be detected by drrbs, respectively, with the same size selection  and read length  in the yh sample . these results suggest that drrbs is more applicable in genome-wide studies of dna methylation with more representative cpg coverage, especially considering recent rapidly decreasing costs of high-throughput sequencing.

accuracy and efficiency of methylation detection of dmrs
to evaluate the accuracy of drrbs, we used whole genome bisulfite sequencing  data for the yh
 <cit>  and mdc
 <cit>  samples that were previously generated. we used data with at least five-fold sequencing depth to assess the methylation status of individual cpg dinucleotides by pearson correlation analysis. a general consistency of methylation levels of cpgs was observed between rrbs and wgbs, in which the pearson correlation coefficients were similar for the two rrbs methods .

as more cpgs within each genomic element were detected by the drrbs method and different cpg coverage in a genomic element generated different distributions of cpg methylation when comparing srrbs with drrbs , we were interested in whether there was a discrepancy in the detection of general methylation levels of a genomic element by the two strategies. we described the average methylation levels of elements using srrbs and drrbs data sets of the mdc sample. interestingly, the methylation levels of elements extracted by the two strategies showed greater differences in the promoter, cgi shore and intron regions than for common cpgs  in those regions . the methylation accuracy of cpg sites was confirmed by the pearson correlation coefficients . consistent results were also observed in scatter analysis . taking promoters as an example, the pearson correlation coefficient of methylation between the two strategies was  <dig>  , while the correlation coefficient was increased to  <dig>  when the common cpgs were analyzed .

as averaging over more cpgs is likely to be more accurate, we then selected the genomic features with more cpg sites enriched by drrbs than srrbs, and compared their methylation levels with wgbs. generally, higher pearson correlation coefficients between drrbs and wgbs were observed than the values for srrbs, indicating that drrbs is more accurate . these results indicated that the average methylation levels could be biased by the coverage of cpgs in specific genomic regions when detected by techniques with different scales of representation. it is important to achieve a full coverage of cpgs to get an accurate estimation of regional dna methylation.

genome-wide profiling of dna methylation in hct <dig> and dko cell lines
colorectal carcinoma cell line hct <dig> and its derivative cell line dko, which bears homozygous deletions of both dnmt3b and dnmt <dig>  are widely used models to study target genes of dna methylation-mediated silencing, especially for tumor suppressor genes 
 <cit>  and mirnas
 <cit> . researchers also observed that a few key regions preferentially maintain their methylation when global dna methylation is artificially reduced in dko cells, indicating that cancer cells might depend on dna methylation for survival
 <cit> . however, genome-wide methylation status accompanied with gene expression profiling has not yet been completed. the full methylome profile for these two cell lines would provide basic data for researchers to fully address the above-mentioned issues. we then used the drrbs method to analyze the methylation status coupled with gene expression profiling by digital gene expression  for the paired cell lines . as expected, large amounts of hypomethylation in different genomic elements were present in dko cells compared with hct <dig> cells . a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> genes showed significantly different levels of dna methylation within their promoter regions . among these genes,  <dig> genes were significantly hypomethylated in dko cells compared with hct <dig> cells. furthermore,  <dig> of the hypomethylated genes were significantly upregulated in dko cells . functional analyses revealed that these  <dig> genes were enriched in a broad spectrum of kegg pathways, including those related to cancer in the mapk signaling pathway and jak-stat signaling pathway . this result suggested that some of these  <dig> genes might be tumor suppressor genes . thus, the global dna methylation, as well as local methylation, in most of the methylated genes in the parental hct <dig> cells were decreased in dko cells, as a consequence of the impaired dna methyltransferase machinery. despite of that, some regions maintained high methylation levels in dko cells . in particular, promoter regions of  <dig> genes remained significantly hypermethylated in dko compared with hct <dig> cells . previously, it was reported that dko cells are under constant selective pressure to retain dna methylation at some key regions to survive
 <cit> . these hypermethylated genes in dko cells detected by the drrbs method might be crucial for cancer cells’ survival.

validation of promoter methylation by bisulfite-pcr sequencing
previously, we identified a series of functional tumor suppressors that are frequently methylated in multiple tumors. using the improved rrbs method, we tested certain known tsgs , including wnt5a <cit> , pcdh <dig> <cit> , dlc <dig> <cit> , irf <dig> <cit>  and znf <dig> <cit> . the results of the expanded rrbs method confirmed that all these genes are relatively hypermethylated in hct <dig>  but hypomethylated in the dko cell line . hence the drrbs provides a robust platform for examining dna methylation changes and will be useful in future applications for identifying tsgs with aberrant methylation.

using bisulfite genomic sequencing with multiple clones, we selected two regions in promoters for further validation. we confirmed that both selected regions were hypermethylated in hct <dig>  but hypomethylated in dko, consistent with the drrbs results . concomitantly, the relative expression levels of the differential methylation regions -associated genes were validated by rt-qpcr and normalized by β-actin expression. both rt-qpcr and dge results suggested that the transcription of these genes was activated when promoter demethylation was achieved through knockout of both dnmt <dig> and dnmt3b in dko cells . ddit4l was previously studied in melanoma patients as a risk factor, with a hypermethylated promoter
 <cit> . in the present study, we found that the expression of ddit4l was low and it had a hypermethylated promoter in hct <dig>  but was reactivated in dko cells, where it showed a decreased methylation level, suggesting an aberrant methylation status of ddit4l in colorectal cancer.

discussion
rrbs is a method that combines genomic dna digestion with size selection of target dna fragments to examine genome-wide dna methylation status, based on restriction enzyme enrichment of cpg-rich regions
 <cit> . previous studies assumed that dna methylation of promoters
 <cit>  and cgis
 <cit>  have the greatest functional significance in regulating gene expression; therefore, the current rrbs strategy retains mspi single enzyme digestion to reproducibly detect the methylation status of cgis
 <cit> , although its coverage on other genomic elements is limited. however, dna methylation in other genomic elements besides cgis might also play important roles in gene regulation, as exemplified by recent studies on dna methylation of cgi shores and introns. in one study, irizarry et al. reported that 76% of tissue differential methylation regions  among liver, spleen and brain, and most methylation alterations in colon cancer, occurred in cgi shores. based on their results, the authors suggested dna methylation of cgi shores might play a functional role in regulating alternative transcription during normal differentiation and cancer pathogenesis
 <cit> . furthermore, dmrs of introns also correlated with tumor aggressive behaviors by regulating alternative splicing
 <cit>  or the transcription of non-coding rnas
 <cit> .

in the present study, the double-enzyme  rrbs strategy reached almost full coverage of genomic elements of cgis  and promoters , with more than  <dig> individual cpgs measurement, even if we only size-selected 40- <dig> bp fragments for sequencing. in particular,  <dig> % of cgi shores and  <dig> % of introns were additionally interrogated, reaching coverage of more than  <dig> % of cgi shores and  <dig> % of introns in comparison with the srrbs . importantly, our results also indicated that the methylation levels of cgi shores, promoters or intron regions significantly varied with the coverage of individual cpg dinucleotides detected by the two rrbs strategies . in other words, the improved drrbs identifies regional methylation levels more accurately because of its extensively increased coverage of genomic elements, and thus could be widely used as a new rrbs strategy in genome-wide identification of dna methylation.

despite the strategy of size-selection, the read length of high-throughput sequencing is an important factor influencing genomic coverage and data requirement for different rrbs strategies. previously, we obtained about  <dig>  m individual cpg dinucleotides using srrbs with a pe <dig> sequencing strategy
 <cit> . in the present study, we demonstrate that the drrbs  method is able to interrogate about  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the genome-wide cpgs using pe <dig> sequencing strategy with 40- <dig> bp and 40- <dig> bp inserts, respectively. as a comparison, it interrogates  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the genome-wide cpgs using a pe <dig> sequencing strategy with 40- <dig> bp and 40- <dig> bp inserts, respectively. although longer read length could increase cpgs coverage, the majority of bases from the pe <dig> reads must be discarded as the reads were beyond the length ranges for many fragments. as a result, the required data for pe <dig> sequencing was about half that for pe <dig> sequencing to achieve the same depth. thus, pe <dig> sequencing is a relatively efficient and cost-effective strategy for drrbs. wgbs consumes micrograms of genomic dna at a high cost; therefore, rrbs is more feasible for complex clinical samples. wgbs is a costly process, yet the costs of high-throughput sequencing are falling; therefore, nor only can we choose other enzyme combinations and size selection for drrbs to obtain a much more comprehensive representation of the genome, but this method could also be applied to large scale studies, such as epigenome-wide association studies
 <cit> .

by applying this drrbs method, we characterized the genome-scale dna methylation at single-base resolution in colorectal carcinoma cell lines hct <dig> and dko. these cell lines have been employed as models by numerous researchers to validate the ability of their designed methods to detecting changes in dna methylation
 <cit> , to study the expression of tsgs
 <cit>  or microrna regulated by dna methylation
 <cit> . interestingly, a recent study applied this cell model to identify genes that are prone to methylation in cancer cells. taking advantages of genome-scale coverage and single-base resolution of our drrbs technology, we extensively screened the dna methylation status of these two cell lines. as expected, many cpg methylation changes were revealed from the comparison between hct <dig> and dko cell lines, which closely agreed with previous findings of hplc-based global methylation analysis
 <cit> . however, only a small amount of genes with significantly decreased methylation levels were significantly upregulated in dko cells, which suggested that these genes might be repressed only by dna methylation. these identified genes would be of interest for researchers in the study of dnmt-targeting mechanism and in the identification of tsgs. on the other hand,  <dig> genes were significantly hypermethylated in dko cells, indicating that these loci might retain methylation due to a functional selection pressure, which is consistent with a recent study
 <cit> . taken together, profiling cytosine methylation in these two cell lines will provide basic data for researchers to study the dna methylation status of thousands of genomic regions and to target those conserved methylation regions required for cancer cell survival using this cellular model.

CONCLUSIONS
we have designed and validated systematically a double-enzyme rrbs strategy, which shows a considerable improvement over the previous single-enzyme rrbs method. this strategy can be applied to profile dna methylation with a considerably increased whole-genome coverage and more accurate identification of methylation levels in various genomic regions. this method will significantly increase the ability of biomedical researchers to study genome-wide dna methylation in multiple and complex clinical samples.
