BACKGROUND
mosquito control represents a major public health concern as mosquitoes transmit many pathogens causing fatal human diseases including malaria, filariasis, dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya  <cit> . vector borne diseases represent a major health threat and economic burden in disease-endemic countries and are currently expanding worldwide  <cit> . as no specific treatment exists for most of these diseases, the most effective way of reducing the incidence of these diseases is to control the vector mosquitoes  <cit> . chemical insecticides still used in endemic countries have shown their limits as resistance has evolved in all target species together with environmental concerns due to their high persistence and toxicity for non-target organisms, including humans  <cit> .

the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis  produces a mosquitocidal toxic crystal during sporulation and represents the best alternative to chemical insecticides for mosquito larval control due to its high potency and specificity  <cit> . the action of bti begins when larvae ingest bti spores and toxic crystals. in susceptible larvae, the toxic crystal is dissolved in the alkaline ph of the midgut, protoxins are then activated by digestive proteases to activated-toxins that bind to specific membrane receptors, form pores, disrupt the midgut epithelium, allowing spore penetration and bacterial proliferation in the host tissues  <cit> . the receptors for mosquitocidal bti cry toxins are similar to the lepidopteran-active cry toxins which utilize n-aminopeptidase, alkaline phosphatase and cadherin proteins as midgut receptors  <cit> .

in contrast to bacillus thuringiensis subspecies active against lepidopteran and coleopteran species where cases of insect resistance in the field have been reported  <cit> , only one study reported bti resistance in field mosquitoes  <cit> . however, subsequent confirmations of this case have not been reported. the delay in the evolution of resistance to bti is believed to be due to its composite toxic crystal containing four major toxins   <cit> . cyt toxins are known to largely enhance cry toxins activity due to synergic effects and to drastically decrease resistance development  <cit> . although bti is known to have a low persistence in the environment, recent studies suggest that it can persist and possibly proliferate in specific conditions  <cit> . in the french rhône-alpes region, decaying leaf litters collected in mosquito breeding sites several months after a bti treatment revealed a high toxicity against mosquito larvae due to the presence of large amounts of bti <cit> . this toxic leaf litter was used to select an aedes aegypti strain in laboratory conditions. after  <dig> generations, the selected strain  was only moderately resistant to the whole bti toxins mixture, but up to  <dig> fold resistant to individual cry toxins  <cit> . although resistance to bti has already been selected in laboratory conditions  <cit> , this is the only reported case of resistance obtained by using field-collected material containing residual bti toxins. therefore, this bti-resistant litox strain provides a unique opportunity to better understand the mode of action of bti toxins and to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance developed by mosquitoes exposed to field residual bti toxins.

to identify the resistance mechanisms developed by the litox strain, a genome scan and a transcriptome scan were previously performed on whole larvae twelve generations ago  <cit> . the main bias of these whole-larvae approaches is that many genes are identified that may not be directly related to bti resistance. indeed, selection was shown to have induced many changes in the litox strain, including decreased egg survival to desiccation, longer larval development time and decreased female fecundity  <cit> , reflecting the evolution of resistance costs that are not directly involved in resistance to bti toxins. because insect midgut is the primary target site for bti toxins our aim in the present work is to focus on constitutive expression changes in midgut proteins of resistant versus susceptible larvae. for that purpose, we combine a comparative analysis of brush border membrane proteins using 2d-dige  with a midgut transcriptome profiling using dna microarrays. in addition, altered gene expression of known bti cry toxins receptors  between the two strains were investigated using rt-qpcr. finally, because the dige didn’t allow detecting proteins with high molecular size such as cadherins, we performed western blots with anti-cadherins antibodies.

RESULTS
resistance levels to bti toxins in the litox strain
after  <dig> generations of selection with leaf litter containing bti, bioassays indicated that the litox strain exhibited a moderate  <dig> -fold resistance to commercial bti mixture vectobac® wg compared to the susceptible strain at the larval stage . when bti cry toxins were tested separately, the litox strain showed an increased resistance of 68-fold, 9-fold and 9-fold to cry4aa, cry4ba and cry11aa protoxins respectively. the relatively important variability observed for the lc <dig> for cry4aa toxin of the litox strain is mainly due to a higher variability in larval mortality in the replicates than for the susceptible strain and for the other toxins. as resistance is not fixed yet in the litox strain  <cit> , this variability between replicates might reflect a large range of different combinations of cry4a resistance alleles between individuals. 

lethal concentrations 50%  of the resistant  and the susceptible strain for the three cry toxins  and for the commercialbtiat 24 h. resistance ratios  <dig>  are calculated for each product as lc50of litox divided by lc50of bora- bora strain. lc50are expressed in ng/ml.

midgut transcriptome profiling
comparative transcriptome profiling between total mrnas extracted from midguts of larvae from the litox and the susceptible strains was performed using a dna microarray representing  <dig> of the more than  <dig> ae. aegypti transcripts identified in vectorbase. a total of  <dig> transcripts were detected in at least  <dig> hybridizations out of  <dig>  . among them,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were significantly over- and under-transcribed respectively in the litox strain  . distribution of transcription ratios was well balanced between over and under-transcription ranging from  <dig> -fold under-expression to  <dig> -fold over-expression . rt-qpcr validation of transcription ratios for  <dig> selected genes revealed a good correspondence between the two techniques, supporting the reliability of microarray data .

differentially transcribed genes were further analyzed according to their biological function by classifying them into  <dig> different categories . genes of unknown function represented 34% of detected transcripts while genes not assigned to any category  represented 17%. enzymes represented 30% of detected transcripts and were strongly over-represented among under- and over-transcribed genes  . proteases were equally represented in over- and under-expressed genes, while detoxification enzymes were more often under- than over-transcribed . transaminases, represented by only  <dig> genes in the ae. aegypti genome, were over-represented in under- and over-transcribed genes while dehydrogenases were strongly over-represented only in over-transcribed genes .

midgut differential proteomics
midgut membrane proteins were compared between larvae of the litox and susceptible strains using 2d-dige . dye-swapping for each biological sample showed no dye-dependent spot changes on the gels . spot locations were reproducible between the biological replicates, but the signal intensity was higher for the second replicate, revealing additional spots differing between the two strains . a total of  <dig> distinct protein spots differently expressed between the two strains were processed and  <dig> unique proteins were identified . the ms/ms analyses gave the same protein identifications between biological replicates for spots  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with high mascot scores  while spots  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  showing mascot scores lower than  <dig>  were assigned to different proteins . indeed, none of the spots with low mascot scores were considered for further analyses. different spots yielded the same identified protein for  <dig> proteins, with a maximum of six spots for aael <dig> .

genes and proteins differentially expressed in the litox strain
proteome analysis identified two n-aminopeptidase proteins  differentially expressed in the litox strain : two spots matching apn aael <dig> were up-regulated and two of the three spots matching apn aael <dig> were down-regulated in the litox strain. transcriptomic approach detected thirteen apn  with transcription level ranging from − <dig>  to + <dig>  fold changes  but none was significant.

proteins are classified according to their putative function using the same  <dig> categories as for transcriptomic data. when different spots pointed to the same protein, they were differentiated using letters after the access number. for each identification, the predicted pi, the predicted mass in kilodaltons , the percentage of sequence coverage and the species and database matched are indicated.

two alkaline phosphatases  proteins, matching aael <dig> and aael <dig>  were under-expressed in the litox strain while transcriptomics identified two other alp genes  significantly over-transcribed in the litox strain with transcription ratios of + <dig>  and + <dig>  fold respectively. all alps but aael <dig> have predicted glycosylphosphatidylinositol -anchor domains allowing them to tether to the epithelial membrane and be potential membrane-bound cry toxin receptors .

four proteins matching atp synthase subunits alpha, beta and epsilon, with two to seven different spots for the same protein, had levels from − <dig>  to − <dig>  lower in the litox strain. this tendency was consistent with microarray data for aael008787-ra , aael <dig>  and aael <dig>  although p values were not significant.

a unique calreticulin protein was picked and identified from dige gels. initially detected as only one big spot with + <dig>  fold change, the second biological replicate allowed clearly identifying four different spots respectively − <dig> , + <dig> , + <dig>  and + <dig>  fold differentially expressed in the litox strain. in microarray experiment, no significant differential transcription of this gene was found in the litox strain.

using blastp software, we managed to identify putative functions for the  <dig> transcripts of unknown function differentially transcribed in the litox strain with protein identities ranging from  <dig> to 99% . among them, two were strongly over-transcribed in the resistant strain  and matched to a putative g <dig> protein in ae. aegypti .

among the five cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase transcripts identified by microarray analyses, cyp4d <dig> was over-transcribed while the others  were under-transcribed in the litox strain. dige experiments identified one protein matching to a cytochrome p <dig> 3-fold over-expressed in the litox strain.

transcriptomic data detected four metalloproteinases significantly under-transcribed from − <dig>  to − <dig>  fold . the presence of conserved domains of soluble astacin-like metalloproteinases together with the absence of detected gpi-anchor domain  suggests that these four metalloproteinases are probably secreted extracellular enzymes, explaining why they were not identified in the bbmv by the dige analysis.

global and specific proteolytic activities
to determine if the modifications in protease transcription levels observed in the resistant strain result in changes in gut proteolytic activities, we compared the protease activities of secreted proteins from larval midgut of each strain using azocasein as substrate. total proteolytic activity was  <dig> % higher in the resistant strain compared to the susceptible strain . the use of specific protease inhibitors revealed that more than 90% of the total proteolytic activity is due to serine protease for both strains. among them, chymotrypsins and trypsins represented respectively more than 40% and 20% of the total activity in both strains. the use of the metalloproteinase inhibitor edta showed that 12% of the total proteolytic activity was due to metalloproteinases in the susceptible strain whereas no inhibition was measured in the resistant strain , suggesting a strong reduction of metalloproteinase activity in the litox strain.

all values are given as mean +/− sem.

discussion
resistance levels to bti toxins in the litox strain
after  <dig> generations of selection, resistance to cry4aa in the litox strain has more than doubled as compared to twelve generations ago, while resistance ratios did not change for cry4ba and cry11aa  <cit> . resistance to bti is moderate  but higher than at generation  <dig> , indicating that resistance alleles are not all fixed yet. these results are consistent with previous attempts to select ae. aegypticulex pipiens and cx. quinquefasciatus with bti which obtained moderate resistance  after  <dig> to  <dig> generations  <cit> . the increased bti resistance observed may be due to the increase in cry4aa resistance, and most changes observed in the present study may be related to cry4aa resistance. the discrepancy between bti and cry4aa increased resistances is likely to be due to the presence of cyt toxin in bti, known to overcome cry resistance in insects  <cit> .

midgut transcriptome and proteome analyses
our comparison of midgut transcripts and brush border proteins between the susceptible and litox strains revealed an overlapping but distinct set of transcripts/proteins differentially expressed. transcriptome profiling with a microarray representing more than 81% of known ae. aegypti transcripts lead to the detection of  <dig> transcripts of which  <dig> were differentially transcribed in the litox strain. this relatively low number of transcripts detected  is probably due to the low transcription level or absence of transcription of several genes in this particular organ —the larval midgut. little overlap was observed between the previous transcriptomic analysis, performed on whole larvae  <dig> generations ago using a dgetp approach  <cit> , and the present study, focusing on midgut gene expression using microarrays. this is possibly due to the technical differences between the two studies and to the fact that no resistance gene is fixed yet in the litox strain, indicated by the still increasing resistance to bti and to cry toxins  <cit> . moreover, as genes conferring resistance to bti toxins are likely to be expressed in larval midgut, focusing on midguts rather than on whole larvae allows to considerably reduce the candidate gene dataset, and to consider only genes likely to be directly involved in resistance, rather than those only indirectly affected by selection side-effects  or compensatory mechanisms   <cit> . the 2d-dige analysis resolved about  <dig> distinct proteins in larval bbmv fractions,  <dig> spots were picked of which  <dig> differed by more than 2-fold between the two strains. the difference between the number of spots picked  and the number of unique identified proteins  is due to different spots for the same protein, as for example up to six spots observed for one v-atpase. the multiple spots for the same protein are most likely due to post-translational modifications  that cause shift in protein mobility. eight spots common to the replicated dige experiments were picked and identified twice. among them all but one, calreticulin , showed similar levels of differential expression supporting the consistency of biological replicates . both transcriptomic and proteomic data identified more under than over-expressed genes/proteins in the litox strain, which is congruent with a previous transcriptome analysis performed on whole larvae  <dig> generations ago  <cit> . such asymmetry is not surprising considering that mechanisms of resistance to bt can involve a decreased activation of protoxins or a decreased toxin-binding to the epithelium membrane  <cit> .

little overlap was found between data obtained by transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. this could be explained by both biological processes and technical limitations inherent to each method. regarding dige, bbmv were used, which are enriched for proteins attached to apical brush border midgut membrane via scaffolding and proteins attached to the inner membrane leaflet via acylation. therefore, except few soluble proteins trapped in re-folded membranes, soluble intracellular proteins and proteins excreted inside the gut lumen are typically absent in bbmv preparations  <cit> . in contrast, mrnas extracted from whole larval midguts should be representative of all transcripts present in midgut cells. another factor limiting overlapping data may be the consequence of the relatively stringent filtering of the microarrays dataset . several studies also showed that mrna transcription profiles fit poorly with protein levels because of numerous post-transcriptional regulatory activities and post-translational events  <cit> . such events generate a high diversity of proteins while gene expression remains unchanged, and this source of variation is so far under-explored in studies on fast adaptive changes like the evolution of insecticide resistance. it is likely that the two complementary approaches used in the present work detected distinct mechanisms of resistance acting at different steps in the mode of action of bti .

altered expression and activities of proteases from the litox strain
four soluble astacin-like metalloproteinases were found significantly under-transcribed in the litox strain. this observation was correlated with a strong decrease of metalloproteinases activity among the enzymes secreted in the midgut lumen of larvae from the resistant strain. to our knowledge, this is the first time astacin-like metalloproteinases are associated to bt resistance. the observed decrease in metalloproteinases in the resistant strain might reflect an alteration in bti cry toxins activation in the gut lumen of litox larvae. further experiments based on measuring proteolytic activities and performing bioassays with activated toxins will clarify the potential role that alteration of protoxins processing, notably for cry4aa, could play in the resistance phenotype.

altered expression of known bti-binding proteins in the litox strain
to validate the expression alteration of putative bti-receptors observed in microarrays and dige approaches, rt-qpcr analyses were performed on five n-aminopeptidases , two cadherins  and three alkaline phosphatases  previously described as binding proteins for cry4ba  <cit>  or cry11aa  <cit>  . 

given values indicate the level of expression in the litox strain compared to the susceptible strain detected in microarrays, rt-qpcr and dige experiments. nd, non detected in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> microarray hydribizations; ni, non identified as differentially expressed between the two strains and therefore non-picked for ms/ms identification; ud, undetectable in 2d-dige due to their high molecular weight and their low amount in bbmv.

the cadherin described as a cry11aa-receptor in ae. aegypti   <cit>  was found  <dig>  fold under-transcribed in both microarrays and rt-qpcr experiments. however, no cadherin was detected by dige approach. the inability to detect cadherin in the dige analysis is not surprising as they are large proteins  present in low amounts in insect brush border membranes  <cit> . blotting of bbmv using two anti-cadherin antibodies showed that most of the cadherins were degraded, even in a freshly prepared ugal aedes bbmv preparation, confirming that cadherins in bbmv are very unstable . western blots showed that cadherin, notably a ~32 kda fragment, is strongly over-represented in the litox strain compared to the susceptible strain . further analyses of the toxins-binding properties of the detected cadherin are needed to better understand the role they could play in the resistance phenotype.

alkaline phosphatases , typically anchored by gpi-moieties, are known to be cry toxin receptors in lepidoptera  <cit>  and mosquitoes  <cit> . recently, a decrease in alp amounts and activities were linked to cry-resistance of larvae from three lepidopteran genera  <cit> . the alps detected as over-transcribed in the litox strain by the two transcriptomic approaches were either not identified as differentially expressed  or identified as under-expressed  by dige approach. these results suggest that the lower alp protein abundance in the epithelium membrane might rather be due to post-translational events than under-expression. indeed, our dige analyses identified three alps showing a decreased expression in the litox strain . moreover, the alp aael <dig> was also detected as under-transcribed in microarrays, rt-qpcr and in a previous transcriptomic study  <cit> . these two alp have already been described as cry4ba-binding proteins  <cit> . the reduction of potential cry-receptor alps proteins on the brush border of litox larvae is consistent with the resistant phenotype.

n-aminopeptidases  are a third major class of cry toxin receptors in lepidoptera  <cit>  and mosquitoes  <cit>  and their alteration correlates with cry1a-resistance in helicoverpa armigera <cit>  and trichoplusia ni <cit> . dige experiments revealed two spots of apn aael <dig> being under-expressed, congruent with transcriptomic data, while another spot was over-expressed in the litox strain. two spots matching apn aael <dig> were over-expressed in the litox strain, as also found by transcriptomic approaches. these two alp proteins have been previously described as potential receptors for cry11aa in ae. aegypti <cit>  but it is still unclear how their altered expression could lead to a higher bti-resistance.

in general, bt resistance involves changes in the cry receptors structure rather than in their expression  <cit> , although some cases of differential expression of cadherin and aminopeptidase have been reported in resistant strains  <cit> . these changes in expression can be the result of diverse genetic mechanisms including mutations in regulatory regions or even genome rearrangements that can drive rapid adaptation to new environmental pressures such as an insecticide treatment. moreover, in the case of bti, the presence of cyt toxins, known to act as cry receptors  <cit> , might contribute to overcome receptor alterations in the litox strain. further analysis of the binding capacities of cry toxins to the putative receptors found differentially expressed here will contribute to evaluate their relative roles in bti resistance. only few studies have focused on cry4aa toxin binding to our knowledge  <cit>  and nothing is known about its potential membrane receptors. such experiments will determine if its receptors are highly specific, explaining the high differences in the resistance ratio between cry4aa and the other cry toxins in the litox strain, or if cry4aa shares all or a part of its receptors with cry4ba and cry11aa that could lead to cross-resistance.

other mechanisms potentially involved in the resistance
all the spots of the four atp synthases detected by our proteomic approach showed an under-expression pattern in the litox strain. vacuolar h+-atpases  subunits b to e are known to bind cry4ba  <cit>  and subunits a and b have been described to bind for cry1ac in heliothis virescens <cit>  and helicoverpa armigera <cit> . moreover, v-atpases are localized in the posterior midgut of mosquito larvae  <cit> , where cry4aa, cry4ba and cry11aa toxins exhibit the highest affinity to the epithelium membrane  <cit> . nevertheless, their role as bti toxins receptors has not been demonstrated yet. v-atpases are strongly implicated in the alkalinization of the midgut ph by establishing a proton motive force by transporting proton across membranes leading to a ph gradient and transmembrane voltage  <cit> . onken et al.  inhibited all the proteins implicated in the alkalinization process in the midgut of ae. aegypti larvae and they showed that only the inhibition of v-atpases induced a strong acidification of the midgut ph  <cit> . as ph affects numerous aspects of toxin action like bt crystal solubility  <cit> , toxin conformation  <cit> , gut enzymes activity  <cit>  and pore formation  <cit> , an alteration of gut ph could have a general effect on reducing bti toxicity. comparing internal larval midgut ph between resistant and susceptible strains will allow to confirm/infirm if the observed atpases decreased expression induce an acidification of the gut lumen.

multiple detoxification enzymes were found under-transcribed in the resistant strain. such enzymes are often involved in the degradation of small chemicals such as insecticides and plant allele-chemicals  <cit> , but they are unlikely to process large proteins such as bti toxins. synthesis of detoxification enzymes represents an important energetic cost for the insect  <cit> . moreover, several detoxification genes found under-transcribed in our dataset, were found over-transcribed in ae. aegypti larvae submitted to a chemical challenge  <cit> . although the over-expression of particular detoxification genes in the resistant strain can be linked to larval response to tannins contained in the toxic leaf litter  <cit> , the frequent under-expression of these enzymes in the resistant strain may reflect compensatory mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
bti has evolved to infect diptera such as mosquitoes and blackflies through a sequential mechanism. the multi-step mode of action of bti and its toxins from ingestion to spore germination and proliferation offers many resistance ways for mosquito larvae. by combining transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, we detected expression alteration at nearly each step of the ingestion-to-infection process. our study paves the way to further functional studies to characterize resistance mechanisms to this bioinsecticide. this information will be of extreme value as this environmentally safe bioinsecticide is increasingly used for vector control worldwide with virtually no knowledge and no suspicion so far about how mosquitoes can develop resistance in the field.
