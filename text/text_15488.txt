BACKGROUND
starch serves as the most important carbohydrate storage reserve for plants, and provides the foundation for human and animal nutrition as well as a raw material for numerous food and industrial applications  <cit> . starch consists of two molecules, long essentially linear chains of α--linked glucopyranosyl residues , and a much larger, highly branched molecule  consisting of thousands of short α--linked glucan chains of degree of polymerisation   <dig> to > <dig> that are attached by α--linked branch points  <cit> .

amylose and amylopectin are synthesised in the plastids, where they assemble into a semicrystalline granule. amylopectin is the major component, making up 70–80% of starch in most species. amylose is synthesised by granule-bound starch synthase , whereas a large complex of enzymes is required to synthesise amylopectin. this complex consists of four soluble starch synthases  and two types of starch branching enzyme , with various debranching enzymes, kinases and other enzymes also involved  <cit> . the availability of various mutants lacking particular enzyme activities has shown how the properties of starch from different species are altered by changes to composition or structure. for example, starch from the waxy mutant of maize   had a lower gelatinisation temperature, whereas that from wheat  had an unaltered gelatinisation temperature but altered pasting properties  <cit> . starch from potato  where gbss had been down-regulated produced gels with improved stability and clarity  <cit> .

differences in amylopectin branching affect granule crystallinity, which together with differences between species in granule size and shape result in altered thermal, pasting and biophysical properties  <cit> . amylopectin branching is carried out by sbei and sbeii, enzymes that create branch points by cleaving α--linkages and reattaching the glucan chain via an α--linkage. alterations in sbe activity affect the number and size distribution of amylopectin branches. in cereals, there are three isoforms of sbe: sbeia, sbeiia and sbeiib, and in the amylose extender mutant of maize that lacks sbeiib, amylopectin had fewer branches and a higher proportion of longer chains  <cit>  that are essentially amylose. similarly in rice , down-regulation of sbeiib decreased the proportion of short branches and increased the proportion of intermediate and long branches  <cit> . in barley , only when both sbeiia and sbeiib were down-regulated was a significant reduction in the frequency of amylopectin branches observed  <cit> . indeed, down-regulation of all three isoforms of sbe in barley produced starch that was entirely amylose  <cit> . in vitro experiments with rice enzymes found that sbeiib transferred chains of dp <dig> and dp <dig>  sbeiia transferred chains of dp6– <dig>  and sbeia produced a range of short and intermediate chains of dp ≤  <dig>  <cit> .

in potato only two isoforms of sbe are involved, sbei  and sbeii   <cit> . sbei is the major isoform, but its down-regulation had little effect on starch structure  <cit> . knockdown of the minor sbeii isoform, however, increased the average chain length of amylopectin, which, as in the maize amylose extender mutant  <cit> , resulted in an increase in apparent amylose content due to the increased proportion of longer linear amylopectin chains  <cit> . knockdown of both sbei and sbeii produced potato starch that was >70% apparent amylose and had a very high phosphorus content  <cit> .

overexpression of sbe activity to modify starch structure is a much more difficult proposition than knockdown, due to the enzyme’s deleterious effects on bacteria during cloning of the constructs  <cit> . overexpression of bacterial glycogen synthase or glycogen branching enzyme produced starch with more branches and more short chains  <cit> , but only one study has successfully overexpressed a plant sbe enzyme. this involved the cloning of an 18 kb genomic fragment containing the native promoter and coding region, including  <dig> introns, of the rice sbeiib gene, and expressing it in a rice sbeiib-deficient background  <cit> . we aimed to examine the role of potato sbeii in starch branching and resultant effects on potato starch properties. potato is now the third most important food crop in the world and the most important non-cereal  <cit> , whose starch also has many uses in the food and manufacturing industries  <cit>  due to its advantages over cereal starches . to do this we employed a simple hybrid cdna/gdna intragene construct containing a single intron to prevent bacterial translation, expressed under the control of the strong tuber-specific potato gbss promoter. an additional way to increase the proportion of branched amylopectin in the granule is to down-regulate gbss and reduce amylose content, so knockdown gbss lines were also generated for comparison.

RESULTS
characterisation of transgenic potato plants
initial experiments confirmed an earlier report that a complete cdna of potato sbeii was unable to be propagated in escherichia coli  <cit> . despite the use of several different bacterial strains, very few colonies were produced and all were subsequently discovered to contain frame-shift mutations . therefore, a complete but hybrid sbeii intragene containing a single intron to prevent bacterial translation was assembled from cdna and genomic dna fragments . a population of  <dig> plants transformed with the sbeii-intron intragene under the control of the gbss promoter was generated . of these,  <dig> plantlets showing good root development were grown to maturity, and tubers exhibited a range of sbeii mrna abundances . sbeii mrna accumulation in these lines ranged from less than wild-type controls , moderate overexpression  to high overexpression . line 1047– <dig> exhibited approximately wild-type mrna abundance of sbeii but with an additional anomalous larger sbeii transcript presumably derived from an aberrant insertion event. to confirm that mrna accumulation of the structurally unrelated starch synthase enzymes ssii and ssiii was not affected by manipulation of sbeii expression, the same gel blot was stripped and re-hybridised. sequential re-hybridisation with labelled probes for ssii and ssiii showed that the mrna abundances of these two genes were essentially indistinguishable from wild-type and empty vector controls .figure  <dig> rna gel blots showing alterations to sbeii and gbss mrna abundance in transgenic plants.

of a population of  <dig> plants putatively transformed with a gbss inverted repeat transgene, only  <dig> were positive for the presence of both the transgene and the selectable marker gene . of these  <dig> lines,  <dig> showed a strong reduction in gbss mrna accumulation . one line, 1041– <dig>  did not show any apparent posttranscriptional gene silencing, and this line was retained as an additional control for some tests since it was transgenic but gbss mrna accumulation was not reduced relative to wild-type.

to assess the effect of overexpression of a sbeii intragene on sbe enzyme activity, sbeii was separated from the major and predominant sbei by separating proteins using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , followed by an in-gel activity reaction and staining for sbe reaction products . the two isoforms of sbe were identified based on the migration of rice and wheat enzymes  <cit>  and the relative activities of potato sbei and sbeii  <cit> . sbeii activity approximately reflected the abundance of sbeii mrna, being similar to wild-type in line 1047– <dig>  and with a range of activities greater than wild-type in a selection of other lines . the greatest enhancement was in lines 1047– <dig> and  <dig>  which possessed sbeii activity almost 3-fold that of wild-type .figure  <dig> sbe activity in tubers from a series of lines transformed with a sbeii overexpression construct.  native page activity gel with sbe activity visualized by iodine staining.  mean relative sbeii activity ± sd as determined from the density of the spots. data are from technical replicate protein preparations from the same pooled tissue as figure  <dig> run on different gels on different days . means not sharing a common letter are significantly different between groups at p =  <dig>  as determined by lsd after a one-way anova test.



effects of altered gbss and sbeii expression on the structure of starch
the effectiveness of silencing of gbss was determined by measuring the percentage of amylose present in the starch from these plants . wild-type and empty vector control starches were approximately 19–26% amylose, but this was reduced to  <dig> – <dig> % in lines 1041– <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in line 1041– <dig>  which showed no reduction in gbss mrna abundance relative to controls , amylose comprised  <dig> % of the total starch, a content within the range found in controls. the percentage of amylose in the  <dig> lines overexpressing sbeii ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, and was similar to controls.table  <dig>

size exclusion chromatography was used to separate amylose from amylopectin . elution profiles consisted of two main regions, a sharp peak eluting at 9–11 min representing high molecular weight amylopectin, and a broader more disperse lower molecular weight peak eluting at 12–17 min representing amylose  <cit> . the small peaks eluting at 18–19 min were probably due to free sugars. the relative areas of the amylopectin and amylose peaks showed that suppression of gbss in line 1041– <dig> substantially reduced the content of amylose and that overexpression of sbeii in line 1047– <dig> slightly reduced the content of amylose, consistent with the biochemical assays . the amylopectin peaks for both transgenic lines eluted at slightly higher molecular weight than wild-type.figure  <dig> size separation of tuber starch polyglucans. starch was solubilised in naoh and gelatinised by heat before size exclusion chromatography on a waters ultrahydrogel linear column. curves are the means of measurements on three independent biological replicates per line. carbohydrate in the eluate was measured by refractive index.



a modified fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis  method was used to examine the effects of altered sbeii and gbss expression on the chain length distribution of debranched polyglucans . polyglucans from wild-type showed a moderate number of side chains of dp <dig>  few side-chains of dp7- <dig>  and a predominant peak of side chains spanning the dp ~ 10- <dig> range . the number of side chains of dp ≥  <dig> was small. overexpression of sbeii in various lines had little effect on the chain length distribution of moderately sized chains of dp13- <dig>  slightly reduced the abundance of larger chains of dp ≥  <dig> and increased the number of short chains of dp ≤  <dig> . the greatest effect was on the number of chains of dp <dig>  with the increase in lines 1047– <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ranging from  <dig> to 56% greater than wild-type . however, there was no obvious correlation between the increase in dp <dig> chain abundance and relative sbeii activity. the only line in which an increase in the abundance of dp <dig> side chains was not observed was line 1047– <dig> , which was the line in which sbeii mrna abundance and activity were not increased .figure  <dig> chain length distribution of amylopectin unit chains.  comparison of size distribution of amylopectin unit chains in starch from tubers with altered sbeii expression.  difference plot showing changes in chain length distribution relative to wild-type.  comparison of size distribution of amylopectin unit chains in starch from tubers with altered gbss expression.  difference plot showing changes in chain length distribution relative to wild-type.



in transgenic lines with a higher proportion of amylopectin in the granule due to reduced amylose content , the chain length distribution of polyglucans was very similar to wild-type . there was a small increase in the number of side chains of dp6- <dig>  and a small decrease in those of dp15- <dig> , changes that were much less pronounced in line 1041– <dig> that did not exhibit silencing of gbss . this suggests that the reduced activity of gbss not only increased the proportion of amylopectin in starch , but also had some small effects on its structure.

amylopectin chain length distribution and the phosphorus content of the starch are related, with phosphorylation predominantly occurring on longer amylopectin chains  <cit> . many studies of starch phosphorylation underestimate the true abundance of phosphate groups by measuring only c6-linked phosphates, and ignoring the more acid-labile c <dig> linkage. we have used an improved method that allows determination of phosphate groups with both linkages. the ratio of c <dig> phosphate content to c <dig> phosphate content was ~ <dig> : <dig> in all lines tested . total phosphate content was ~40 nmol per mg starch in a wild-type line, an empty vector transformant and two lines with knockdown of gbss expression. however, total phosphate content was reduced by ~25% in two lines in which sbeii expression was increased, with both c6- and c3-linked phosphate content being reduced.table  <dig>

effects of altered gbss and sbeii expression on the morphology of starch granules
to test whether the morphology of the starch granules was altered by the transgenic modifications, a range of microscopy techniques was employed . brightfield microscopy showed a wide range of granule sizes in wild-type starch , and neither knockdown of gbss nor overexpression of sbeii had any obvious effect on the size range distribution of the granules. granules from wild-type and sbeii overexpressors stained dark blue with iodine , whereas granules from gbss knockdown plants showed the pale purple colour typical of a low amylose content but with visible dark blue staining at the hilum core. examination under polarised light detected birefringence visible as a ‘maltese cross’ shape and blue and yellow sectors . birefringence was higher in the gbss knockdown line, presumably since these lines are higher in amylopectin content, which has a more ordered orientation  than amylose. an increased birefringence in the gbss knockdown line was also observed using differential interference contrast microscopy . variable pressure scanning electron microscopy showed that the external morphology of the starch granules was not affected by gbss knockdown or by sbeii overexpression .figure  <dig> images of tuber starch granules from wild-type and transgenically modified potato tubers.  brightfield.  brightfield, starch stained with i2/ki.  polarised light.  differential interference contrast.  variable pressure scanning electron microscopy.  optical section of starch fluorescently labelled with apts taken using confocal scanning laser microscopy. lines used were wt <dig>  1041– <dig> and 1047– <dig>  the scale bar  for light microscopy pictures  represents 100 μm, and for the scanning electron microscopy  represents 40 μm.



details of the internal structure of the granules were examined by fluorescent labelling with 8-amino- <dig> ,6-pyrenetrisulfonic acid  combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy . apts labels the single reducing end of each molecule with high efficiency, and since amylose molecules are much smaller than the highly branched amylopectin molecules, they exhibit a higher fluorescence . a small intensely labelled region at the hilum core was visible in all the lines, indicating a high concentration of amylose at this site. this was observed even in the low amylose gbss knockdown line, and is consistent with the iodine staining of this site seen under brightfield microscopy. growth rings were more visible in the wild-type, suggesting that the deposition of amorphous and crystalline growth rings may have been altered in the transgenic lines. however, overall fluorescence was lower in both of the transgenic lines, and was too low for clear visualisation of growth rings in the sbeii overexpressors.

thermal and gelatinisation properties of transgenically modified starch
the different contents of amylose, short-branched amylopectin and phosphorus in the starch would be expected to result in altered thermal and gelatinisation properties. both knockdown of gbss expression and overexpression of sbeii markedly altered the onset of gelatinisation temperature , but in opposite ways . in wild-type and empty vector controls, to ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> °c, whereas in three lines with reduced gbss expression and lowered amylose content , to was increased by ~4°c, to  <dig>  to  <dig> °c. in the transgenic line 1041– <dig>  with unaltered gbss expression, to was not increased relative to controls. in contrast, overexpression of sbeii in various  <dig> lines reduced to by up to 3°c . in these lines, a trend towards lowered to  correlated strongly  with the trend of increasing sbeii activity . in line 1047– <dig>  which showed sbeii activity similar to wild-type, to was not reduced and was within the range of variability seen in control lines. the temperature of gelatinisation peak , temperature of gelatinisation conclusion  and gelatinisation enthalpy  showed similar trends to to in all of the lines.table  <dig>

an examination of starch pasting properties using a rapid visco analyser  detected differences between the lines , including the lowered to of starch from line 1047– <dig> and the increased to of starch from line 1041– <dig>  other than the onset temperature, pasting profiles were similar in shape, but with a reduction in peak viscosity of ~10% for line 1047– <dig> and ~24% for line 1041– <dig>  final viscosities were also reduced in both transgenic lines.figure  <dig> comparison of pasting properties of tuber starch from wild-type and transgenic lines. pasting properties were assessed in starch from lines exhibiting gbss knockdown  or sbeii overexpression . changes in viscosity of 7%  starch suspensions during heating and subsequent cooling were measured by rva. curves are the means of measurements on three independent biological replicates per line. the thin dotted line shows the change in temperature during measurement.



the greatest difference in physicochemical properties was seen in the gelatinisation of starch granules in urea. in 4 m urea, starch granules from line 1041– <dig> showed very little gelatinisation, with a swollen pellet volume only one-third that of wild-type starch granules . starch from lines 1041– <dig> and 1041– <dig> produced similar results . in contrast, starch granules from line 1047– <dig> exhibited a huge amount of gelatinisation, producing a large and diffuse pellet with a swollen volume 3-fold greater than that of wild-type. starch from line 1047– <dig> produced similar results . examination of a range of urea concentrations showed that gelatinisation was initiated at a lower urea concentration in starch granules from 1047– <dig>  but followed a similar curve to wild-type and achieved a similar maximum swollen volume . gelatinisation followed a very different pattern in starch granules from 1041– <dig>  beginning at a higher urea concentration and showing a remarkably steep increase in swollen pellet volume over a change in urea concentration from 4 m to 6 m. the maximum swelling volume achieved by 1041– <dig> was up to 25% greater than wild-type, and at urea concentrations above 7 m occupied the entire 1 ml volume of the original liquid provided.figure  <dig> changes in gelatinisation of tuber starch granules from transgenic potato lines.  effect of gbss knockdown  or sbeii overexpression  on starch granule swelling in 4 m urea.  comparison of swelling of starch granules in a range of urea concentrations. gelatinisation was assessed by measuring the volume of the swollen starch pellet. data are mean pellet volumes ± sd .



the extent of sbeii overexpression had a clear effect on the swollen volume of the starch granules in 4 m urea . in line 1047– <dig>  swollen pellet volume was less than wild-type. however, the other lines formed a series of increasing swollen pellet volume, in the order wt < 1047–5 = 1047–23 < 1047–12 ≤ 1047–17 ≤ 1047– <dig>  this order reflected the trend in increasing sbeii activity , confirming that sbeii activity and starch swelling power are positively correlated . in contrast, the increase in swollen pellet volume was strongly but negatively correlated  to the reduction of to .figure  <dig> effects of altered sbeii expression on the gelatinisation of tuber starch granules in 4 m urea. data are mean pellet volumes ± sd . means not sharing a common letter are significantly different between groups at p =  <dig>  as determined by lsd after a one-way anova test. a photograph of one of the replicates is shown above the histogram.



discussion
the manipulation of starch properties is important commercially for various industrial applications, as well as for the production of food ingredients. several loss-of-function mutants and rnai knockdown studies have helped elucidate the role of particular enzymes in starch biosynthesis  <cit> , but overexpression of starch biosynthetic enzymes is more difficult to accomplish and few examples exist. in one study, overexpression of sbeiib in rice produced starch with increased branching, reduced to, increased solubility and increased swelling power  <cit> . however, potato starch has several advantages over cereal starch for commercial applications. rice starch granules are small  and polygonal with sharp edges  <cit> , a high lipid content and a high to, whereas potato starch granules are of a large oval shape of average size 40 μm and are less crystalline than rice starch  <cit> . starch from potato is also highly phosphorylated relative to cereal starch  <cit> . the large granule size, low crystallinity, low lipid content and high phosphate content give potato starch a low temperature for onset of gelatinisation, and a high swelling power and viscosity that are useful for both culinary and industrial applications.

amylopectin chains have a polymodal size distribution, and models of amylopectin structure propose a long c chain that contains the single reducing terminal residue, long inner b chains that carry additional branches, and shorter, outer a chains that do not carry additional branches and are linked to the b chains  <cit> . polymodal chain size distributions of dp 6– <dig>  13– <dig>  25– <dig> and ≥ <dig> are believed to correspond to a chains , and various classes of longer b chains  <cit> . the abundance of short a chains of dp 6– <dig> probably determines the starch crystalline allomorph  <cit> . a range of sbeii overexpression levels increased the number of amylopectin chains of dp ≤  <dig> and caused a particularly large increase in those of dp <dig> . this did not result in any obvious difference in the shape or size of the granules or in their iodine staining properties , presumably because amylose content was not substantially affected . iodine staining is largely due to the content of amylose, which has a 20-fold stronger binding capacity for iodine than does amylopectin  <cit> . in contrast, knockdown of gbss resulted in a pale purple colour upon iodine staining , indicating a low amylose content, but with dark blue staining and intense fluorescence at the hilum . a high concentration of amylose at the hilum core even in gbss-silenced lines is consistent with previous observations  <cit> . knockdown of gbss did not bring about an alteration in the appearance of the granules ,  <cit> .

starch gelatinisation, caused by heating starch in excess water , is due to disruption of the molecular order in the crystalline regions and results in irreversible granular swelling and starch solubilisation. the temperature required for starch gelatinisation, and the swelling volume achieved, are affected by granule size and shape, the amylose:amylopectin ratio, amylopectin branching, phosphorus content and other factors. overexpression of sbeii created amylopectin with a high abundance of short dp <dig> side chains and facilitated gelatinisation, enabling gelatinisation to occur at a lower temperature  and at a lower concentration of urea . granule size and shape were not affected by gbss knockdown or sbeii overexpression, but amylose content, amylopectin branching and phosphorus content were altered. starch phosphorylation occurs mainly on the longer branches of amylopectin, with only a minor proportion on short amylopectin chains, and is essentially absent on amylose  <cit> . thus, knockdown of gbss expression and the resulting low amylose content had little effect on the degree of starch phosphorylation . in sbeii overexpression lines, the increased number of short branches of dp ≤  <dig> and reduced number of longer branches of dp ≥  <dig> should reduce total starch phosphorus content to some extent, and a 25% reduction was observed.

studies on cereal starch have suggested that swelling power is exclusively due to the properties of the amylopectin, with amylose and lipids inhibiting swelling  <cit> . in sbeii-overexpressing line 1047– <dig>  the swelling volume in 4 m urea was increased to approximately 65% of the maximal volume achieved , compared with only 20% for wild-type . a very low amylose content in line 1041– <dig> changed the gelatinisation response to urea concentration, and increased swelling power at >6 m urea ,  <cit> , but amylose content in the sbeii overexpressing lines was hardly different from wild-type . this suggests that amylopectin branching pattern was the major factor influencing starch swelling power. previous studies have found that to decreased when there was an increased frequency of short amylopectin branches, due either to knockdown of isoamylase <dig> or overexpression of sbeiib in rice  <cit> , or knockdown of ssii/ssiii or overexpression of bacterial glycogen branching enzyme in potato  <cit> . the converse finding, that an increased tp results from a reduction in the frequency of short branches due to knockdown of sbeii genes in rice and barley  <cit>  or the amylose extender  mutant of maize  <cit> , confirms the influence of starch branching frequency on thermal properties.

in lines with a range of sbeii expression, there was a correlation between sbeii activity, the degree of reduction in to and the degree of increase in the swelling volume in 4 m urea. in other studies, comparisons between transgenic potato lines found that swelling power was decreased when either amylopectin branching was reduced , or phosphorus content was reduced )  <cit> . a knockdown of gwd that reduced starch c6-linked phosphorus content by 85% had little effect on to ortp, although swelling power was considerably reduced  <cit> . we observed increased swelling power in starch from our sbeii overexpressing lines, despite a 25% reduction in phosphorus content. thus, increased amylopectin branching rather than small changes in amylose or phosphorus content most likely produced both the lowered to and increased swelling power. consistent with the data presented here, increased branching in rice starch was also reported to increase swelling volume  <cit> , although differences were not quantified and the swelling power of rice starch is very small relative to that of potato starch  <cit> .

the present study shows that overexpression of potato sbeii increases the proportion of short chains of dp6- <dig>  consistent with in vitro experiments that found potato sbeii transfers a high number of chains of dp <dig>  <cit>  and knockdown of sbeii that caused an increase in average chain length  <cit> . we propose that this results in an abnormal amylopectin structure with reduced crystallinity, thus altering gelatinisation properties. in contrast, the increase in to found in the gbss knockdown lines was most likely due to the reduced amylose content, since the degree of amylopectin branching and the phosphorus content were not substantially altered . an increase in the gelatinisation temperature of low-amylose potato starch has been noted previously  <cit> .

both genetic manipulations caused a lowered peak viscosity as determined by rva, which measures changes in viscosity of the starch as it is heated and cooled under constant stirring . a rapid rise in viscosity upon heating caused by gelatinisation is followed by a decline as the amylopectin matrix structure is broken down by mechanical shearing. the two amylose-containing starches  showed a higher peak viscosity and a slightly higher setback viscosity after cooling than line 1041– <dig>  the reduced peak and final viscosities of low-amylose starches, such as that from 1041– <dig>  are consistent with previous studies  <cit> . starch from a line overexpressing sbeii also had a reduced viscosity, presumably due to the increased ratio of short to long amylopectin branches  <cit> . this is useful commercially since a reduction in the viscosity of potato starch is highly desirable in the production of manufactured products, in order to facilitate handling  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here show that overexpression of the potato sbeii gene can be achieved in potato, and that a relatively small single-intron construct obviates the difficulties of either manipulating a very large genomic fragment or cloning a functional sbeii cdna gene in bacteria. the use of potato rather than cereals is advantageous since transformation is more facile and starch yields are high. the abundance of short amylopectin branches and thermal properties are highly correlated, and elsewhere highly branched starch with many short chains has been shown to have a lower gelatinisation temperature and improved rheological properties  <cit> . the to of native potato starch is up to 10°c lower than that of rice starch  <cit> , and in the work presented here the increased abundance of short amylopectin branches has lowered it by another 3°c and reduced viscosity while increasing swelling power. such starches may be expected to find many uses in the food and manufacturing industries.

additionally, although modifying the amylopectin branching pattern in planta requires the use of genetic modification, starch produced in this way may replace chemically modified starch in food applications and thus remove environmental concerns and food additive labelling requirements. previously, studies of overexpression of starch branching enzymes in potato have used bacterial enzymes  <cit> . since the transgene used for overexpression in the current work consisted of a modified potato sbeii gene that did not contain any non-potato elements and was controlled by a potato promoter and terminator , the approach could be used to create entirely intragenic plants where all the transferred dna  is derived from the potato genome  <cit> . the use of intragenic technologies with all-potato dna may ultimately remove the need for genetic modification labelling  <cit> .
