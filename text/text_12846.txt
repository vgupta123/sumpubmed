BACKGROUND
the genus acinetobacter comprises  <dig> species with valid names and nine genomic species with provisional designations that were defined by dna-dna hybridization. acinetobacter baumannii, a. pittii and a. nosocomialis are the three species more frequently associated with human diseases  <cit> . a. baumannii is the species that is more frequently isolated in hospitalized patients, especially in intensive-care-unit  wards. the capability to survive in dry conditions and resistance to disinfectants and antimicrobial agents contribute to the selection of a. baumannii in the hospital setting  <cit> .

epidemics caused by multidrug-resistant  strains of a. baumannii were reported in several hospitals worldwide and shown to be caused by a. baumannii strains resistant to all classes of antimicrobials including carbapenems, exhibiting variable resistance to rifampicin and tigecycline, but still susceptible to colistin  <cit> . outbreaks were caused by clusters of highly similar a. baumannii strains that were assigned by several genotypic methods to three main international clonal lineages initially named european clones i, ii and iii  <cit> , and now are referred to as international clones i, ii and iii, respectively  <cit> . the predominance of international clone ii lineage world-wide and the occurrence of hospital outbreaks caused by mdr strains belonging to novel genotypes not related to the three main clonal complexes have been reported during the last few years  <cit> .

we have recently reported  <cit>  the draft genome sequences of three a. baumannii strains,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively assigned to st   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which are representative of the most frequent genotypes responsible for epidemics occurred in mediterranean hospitals  <cit> . here we compare the genomes of the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> strains and the genomes of four wholly sequenced mdr a. baumannii strains, two assigned to st <dig>  one each to st <dig> and st <dig>  data helped to define core and auxiliary genome components of the a. baumannii genomes.

RESULTS
features of the genome of st <dig>  <dig>  st <dig>  <dig> and st <dig>  <dig> strains
the draft genome sequences of the st <dig>  <dig>  st <dig>  <dig> and st <dig>  <dig> strains, isolated during cross-transmission episodes occurred at the monaldi hospital, naples, italy between  <dig> and  <dig>  comprised  <dig> , <dig> bases,  <dig> , <dig> bases and  <dig> , <dig> bases, and generated  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  protein coding sequences by automated annotation against a. baumannii ab <dig> genome, respectively  <cit> . the st <dig>  <dig> strain contained two plasmids, p1-abst <dig> and p2-abst <dig>  that both carry one copy of the carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinase  blaoxa- <dig> a gene which encodes a protein identical but for a single amino-acid substitution to the product of the blaoxa- <dig> gene. the st <dig>  <dig> strain contained also two plasmids, p1-abst <dig> carrying a complete tra locus, and p2-abst <dig> carrying one copy of the chdl blaoxa- <dig> gene. p1-abst <dig> and p2-abst <dig> were homologous to plasmids pacicu <dig> and pacicu <dig> identified in the st <dig> acicu strain  <cit> , respectively. while p1-abst <dig> and pacicu <dig> are almost identical, p2-abst <dig> shares only two third of the coding sequences with pacicu <dig>  the plasmid p1-abst <dig> identified in the st <dig>  <dig> strain shares approximately 80% of the coding sequences, including the blaoxa- <dig> gene, with plasmid pacicu <dig> . the different plasmids were classified using the pcr-typing procedure recently described  <cit> . a conserved scaffold that includes four/five direct perfect repeats that can be defined as "iterons", and the gene encoding the replicase repaci <dig> belonging to the rep- <dig> superfamily and assigned to the gr <dig> homology group, was found in plasmids pacicu <dig>  p2abst <dig>  p2abst <dig> and p1abst <dig>  the repacix replicase  is encoded by plasmids pacicu <dig> and p2abst <dig>  the aci <dig> replicase  by pacicu <dig> and p1abst <dig> plasmids. a protein identical to the replicase encoded by plasmid pmma <dig> carrying the blaoxa- <dig> gene  <cit> , is encoded by p1abst <dig>  while sharing common sequences, all plasmids exhibited a mosaic genetic structure that might have been generated by multiple recombination events. the hypothetical gene products encoded by the plasmids found in the a. baumannii strains  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are listed in additional file  <dig> 

the a. baumannii chromosome
making use of the mauve software  <cit> , the proteins putatively encoded by the draft genomes of the a. baumannii strains  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  were compared to the orfs encoded by the wholly sequenced genomes of the a. baumannii ab <dig> and aye strains assigned to st <dig>  acicu strain assigned to st <dig>  atcc <dig> strain assigned to st <dig>  <cit> .

a. baumannii genomes exhibit extensive synteny. sequence comparisons revealed that  <dig> coding regions are conserved, at the same chromosomal position, in the compared a. baumannii genomes. a file including all conserved gene products is available upon request. genes encoding proteins shown or hypothesized to be important for pathogenicity are conserved in the analyzed strains at the same relative chromosomal position . the set includes ompa, the outer membrane protein which has role in biofilm formation  <cit>  and induces, when secreted, death of epithelial and dendritic cells  <cit> , the dd-endopeptidase, which contributes to the resistance of a. baumannii to bactericidal activity presumably by remodelling the cell surface  <cit> , phospholipase d, an enzyme crucial for proliferation in human serum  <cit> , proteins involved in the formation of capsule  <cit> , type i pili  <cit> , and iron metabolism  <cit> . according to the published annotation, ompa, dd-endopeptidase, phospholipase d, and many other deduced gene products are smaller in atcc  <dig> as compared to their orthologs. size differences do not denote allelic variation, but are determined by the criteria adopted to select the initiating methionine in atcc <dig> orfs.

* the asterisk indicates one of the  <dig> proteins putatively encoded by atcc <dig> not included in the genbank:nc_ <dig> file. tblastn refer to unannotated  <dig> and  <dig> proteins identified by tblastn searches.

multidrug resistance is a key feature of a. baumannii and several genes have a role in establishing a mdr phenotype. genes encoding efflux pumps and resistance proteins shown or hypothesized  <cit>  to be involved in the process are conserved in all strains. in contrast, genes encoding drug-inactivating and drug-resistant enzymes reside in accessory dna regions which are present only in some strains . among these, are worth of mention the extended spectrum beta-lactamase veb- <dig> gene, found in the aye genome, the blaoxa- <dig> class d beta-lactamase gene, found in the acicu and  <dig> genomes, both assigned to st <dig> genotype, the chdl genes blaoxa- <dig>  found in the ab <dig> genome, blaoxa- <dig>  found in the plasmids of  <dig>  acicu and  <dig> strains, and blaoxa- <dig> found in the plasmids of  <dig> strain, respectively. promoter sequences within flanking insertion sequences likely influence the expression of many of these resistance genes. interestingly, the majority of the genomes harbour mutations in gyra and/or parc genes.

shared synteny lets to represent the a. baumannii chromosomes as ˜ <dig> mb long dna segments homologous to each other throughout their lengths . dna tracts, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kb, are present in one or more strains, but missing or replaced by alternative dna segments in others . some of these regions correspond to dna sequences earlier suspected to be mobile because found in a. baumannii but not in a. baylyi dna or vice versa  <cit> . specific 15- <dig> kb regions are missing in all strains but ab <dig> , and may therefore plausibly correspond to strain-specific deletions. many of the accessory genomic dna segments exhibit characteristic features of genomic islands, such as the presence of insertion sequences at one end, a gc content different from the bulk chromosome, insertion within trna or non-coding rna genes, target site duplications  at the ends formed upon genome integration  <cit> . for sake of simplicity, all the accessory dna regions have been called genomic islands . geis found at the  <dig> variable loci identified in the a. baumannii genomes, and some of their properties, are diagrammatically reported in figure  <dig>  tsds flanking geis are reported in additional file  <dig>  and gei gene products are listed in additional file  <dig>  in text and figures individual geis are referred by the locus number and the strain acronym used in figure  <dig>  core and accessory chromosomal dnas are fully conserved in acicu and  <dig> strains. because of this, only the acicu geis are shown in figure  <dig>  in draft genomes some geis reside in different contigs. the colinearity of the contigs and the gei dna content of the corresponding chromosomal regions were assessed by sequencing pcr products bridging contigs ends.

a close look at a. baumannii chromosomes further identified about one hundred dna regions encoding 1- <dig> orfs smaller than  <dig> kb conserved in one or more strains, but missing, or replaced by non homologous dna of comparable length, in others. the potential gene products encoded by these smaller accessory regions, that we called mhrs , are reported in additional file  <dig> 

categories of genomic islands
some islands are strain-specific; others are completely or partially conserved in more than one strain. non homologous islands are inserted at the same locus in different strains, and some loci are extremely heterogeneous, featuring up to 4- <dig> alternative islands. some islands are composite, and changes in their organization among strains are correlated to changes in the number and association of specific dna segment. thus, for example, g54st <dig> can be viewed as made by abc segments. segments ab are missing in g54acb, segments ac in both g54abn and g54aby, and segment c is replaced by a shorter dna segment in g54acb . on the basis of the putative gene products, geis can be broadly sorted into a few categories. properties and overall organization of relevant geis are below discussed.

resistance islands
many of the accessory drug resistance determinants of table  <dig> found in ab <dig> and aye are encoded by genes located within g4aby, g4abn and g5abn, which correspond to the resistance regions previously described as abar <dig>  abar <dig>  and abar <dig>  <cit> , respectively. g4aby and g4abn are both inserted in the comm gene, and result from the association of the  <dig> kb tn <dig> transposon with multiple antibiotic resistance regions , which are delimited by tn <dig> elements  <cit> . tn <dig> features genes involved in transposition , an arsenate resistance operon, a universal stress protein gene , and a sulphate permease gene . marr are inserted within uspa and vary in length and composition  <cit> . the g4abc island of the acicu genome corresponds to the abar <dig> region  <cit> , which carries few resistance genes and lacks tn <dig> sequences . g4st <dig> is similarly inserted in the comm gene, and features genes homologous to tnia and tnib , but lacks resistance genes and encodes a set of hypothetical proteins . g <dig> is missing in strain  <dig>  however, resistance genes are scattered in different geis of this strain . the aada <dig>  gene, flanked by satr  and dhfr  genes are found in g63st <dig>  genes involved in resistance to mercury  are located in g17st <dig>  and a  <dig>  kb dna segment containing feoab , czc  and ars  genes are found in g8st <dig>  next to the cus  genes conserved in all g <dig> . the g62acb region also contains cus, feo and czc genes involved in heavy metal resistance. these genes differ in sequence and overall arrangement from g8st <dig> homologs. this supports the notion that the set of accessory genes had been independently acquired by the strains  <dig> and atcc <dig> 

additional resistance genes found in geis include an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene , a dihydropteroate synthase gene , and an abc-type multidrug transport system, conserved in all the g <dig> islands.

geis encoding surface components and transport systems
gei- <dig> and gei- <dig> host genes involved in cell envelope. heterogeneity among a. baumannii strains at the level of o-antigen biosynthetic genes was already noticed , and is correlated to the presence of alternative glycosylases. the g <dig> island, present in all strains but acicu,  <dig> and  <dig>  is a four gene operon involved in the assembly of fimbriae  by the chaperone/usher pathway  <cit> . g44aby corresponds to the surface adhesion protein region annotated as cus1r in the aye genome  <cit> . g19st <dig> and g19st <dig> are related islands which both carry an operon encoding three hypothetical lipoproteins. of these, one exhibits homology to csgg, the key factor in the secretion of curli, the proteinaceous component having a role in host cell adhesion and biofilm formation in many enterobacteriaceae  <cit> . purified csgg forms ring-shaped complexes analogous to those formed by outer membrane channel-forming proteins  <cit> . the csgg-like protein, in association with the two co-expressed lipoproteins, may influence the permeability of the outer membrane of a. baumannii.

filamentous haemagglutinin  is a major virulence factor in bordetella pertussis  <cit> . fhab and fhac genes, respectively encoding the haemagglutinin and the transporter protein, have been identified in many pathogens  <cit> . fhabc gene clusters are found at the same loci in strains  <dig> and  <dig> , and strains acicu and  <dig>  the transporter proteins are highly conserved in the four clusters, whereas fhas vary in length , mostly because of changes in the number and organization of body sequence repeats  <cit> . a  <dig> amino acids long calcium binding hemolysin protein, unrelated to fhas, is encoded by g18acb.

cyclopropane fatty acids  are phospholipids found in the bacterial membranes in the late exponential and early stationary phases of cell growth  <cit> , which derive from the corresponding unsaturated fatty acid  phospholipids. the synthesis of cfa is catalyzed by the enzyme cfa synthase, the substitution of a saturated by an unsaturated fatty acid by the enzyme delta- <dig> acyl-lipid desaturase. cfa synthase and delta- <dig> acyl-lipid desaturase are both encoded by g47abn and g47aby.

g33st <dig> is a large island which encodes four different transport and translocation systems: i) tat  proteins, involved in the translocation of folded proteins to the cell envelope or the extracellular space ii) a tonb/exbbd complex iii) a opp  complex iv) a sulfur utilization system, made by a fmnh2-dependent sulfonatase and three abc-type transporters, which resemble the products of the e. coli ssu gene cluster  <cit> . two unlinked copies of the sulfonatase gene are also present. genes involved in the capture and intracellular transport of iron are found in different islands. g57abc carries a gene cluster involved in the synthesis of the high-affinity siderophore enterobactin. heme oxygenase is an alternative to siderophores to capture iron from the environment  <cit> . g <dig>  an island which is conserved in  <dig>  acicu and ab <dig>  carries an operon encoding a heme oxygenase, an outer membrane and a tonb family protein. the presence of a flanking fecir gene cluster suggests that heme internalization may be regulated by the fec transduction system  <cit> . the fhubcd genes, which catalyze the internalization of iron iii hydroxamate compounds, are located on g <dig>  an island conserve in all strains but ab <dig> and aye.

metabolic islands
many geis carry genes encoding proteins involved in specific metabolic pathways. g23st <dig> carries a mph  gene complex, involved in the conversion of phenol to cathecol, flanked by a sigma54-dependent activator gene. it has been shown that the expression of mph gene complex described in acinetobacter sp. phae- <dig> is dependent on the alternative sigma factor rpon  <cit> . g37st <dig> carries nag genes, involved in the metabolism of naphthalene. in ralstonia  <cit> , nag genes are arranged in two separate clusters, involved in the conversion of naphthalene to gentisate , and gentisate to pyruvate and fumarate , respectively. in g37st <dig> nagikl genes and naggh, encoding the salicylate 5-hydroxylase, are linked, and flanked by benzoate transport genes.

g43st <dig> carries genes involved in the catabolism of 3hpp  and pp . in e. coli, the dioxygenase complex , and the dihydrodiol dehydrogenase  oxidize pp  and ci  to dhpp  and dhci , respectively. these substrates are subsequently converted to citric acid cycle intermediates by the mhp genes products  <cit> . the hca and mhp genes, separated in e. coli, are linked and interspersed with additional genes  in g43st <dig>  g21st <dig> potentially encodes  <dig> proteins  possibly involved in the metabolism of tartrate. proteins exhibiting homology to the dienelactone hydrolase, an enzyme which plays a crucial role in the degradation of chloro-aromatic compounds, are encoded by the islands g30st <dig>  g34abn and g34aby. g46st <dig> is made by an operon including the salicylate 1-monooxygenase , a benzoate transporter  and the sala regulator  genes. a salicylate 1-monooxygenase is also encoded by g25st <dig>  the genes faba, fabb, fabg, fabf, acpp, pslb, acsa, involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids  <cit>  are conserved in all a. baumannii strains, at separate loci. orthologues of all these genes are clustered in g6abc and g6acb.

phage islands
many variable genomic regions are relatively large  dna blocks which potentially encode typical phage products. these regions have all been classified as cryptic prophages . three to six cps were identified in each strain. six of the different  <dig> cps identified are present in two or more strains, the remaining  <dig> are strain-specific. cps characteristically carries at one end an integrase gene, and many are sharply defined by flanking tsds induced upon insertion. cps are poorly related to each other, and even cps of the same type differ in size and coding ability. ten of  <dig> cps were assigned to four groups on the basis of sequence homologies . cps found at the same locus encode identical or highly homologous  integrases. cp <dig> encode different integrases, which are homologous to cp5- or cp9-encoded enzymes. this explains why cp <dig> and cp <dig> in ab <dig> and atcc <dig> , and cp <dig> in  <dig> and acicu , and cp <dig> in atcc  <dig> , are inserted at the same locus. cp <dig> are integrated at different sites of the ab <dig> genome , but the target in both is an arg-trna gene.

remnants of prophage sequences are found in g33abn and g33aby. these islands share the g33abc backbone, but contain also large dna segments, reiterated in a head-to-tail configuration, in which genes encoding phage and hypothetical proteins are variously interleaved. g33abn and g33aby hypothetical gene products exhibit poor homology to all cps gene products, and therefore were not included among cps.

phages may acquire orfs named morons  <cit>  by lateral gene transfer. the paps reductase  encoded by cp <dig> , the toxin-antitoxin  system encoded by cp <dig> , the proofreading 3'-5' exonuclease epsilon subunit of the dna polymerase iii in the above mentioned cps, the umudc gene products, which are the components of the error-prone dna polymerase v, again in cp <dig>  and cp <dig>  can all be considered morons. not surprisingly, these enzymes are frequently associated with mobile genome elements  <cit> . unlinked umud and umuc genes are conserved in all a. baumannii strains, and an umudc cluster resides on the  <dig> kb pacicu <dig> plasmid.

g9acb also contains an umudc cluster. this  <dig> kb region, found only in the atcc  <dig> strain, is a composite genomic island, carrying at one end a dihydropteroate synthase gene, at the other a dna mismatch repair enzyme. g9acb carries a complete set of type iv secretion system  genes, arranged in the same order in which t4ss homologs are found on the  <dig> kb plasmid of yersinia pseudotuberculosis ip <dig> strain  <cit> . because umudc genes are carried by this plasmid, one may hypothesize that raises g9acb had been imported from yersinia. in addition, a g9acb gene cluster, including an integrase, a dna helicase and a trbl/virb <dig> conjugal transfer protein is highly homologous to a gene cluster from enterobacter cloacae.

additional islands
g3st <dig> carries a cre genes cluster. in e. coli the cre locus includes a response regulator  a sensor kinase  and an inner membrane protein . the corresponding two-component regulatory system creb-crec controls the expression of a variety of genes, among which the cred regulator. overexpression of crebc causes modification of the envelope, inducing the colicin e <dig> tolerance phenotype  <cit> .

g51st <dig> and g51acb carry the rtca and rntz genes, encoding the rna 3'-terminal phosphate cyclase and the rnasez, respectively. the cyclase catalyzes the atp-dependent conversion of the 3'-phosphate to the 2', 3'-cyclic phosphodiester at the end of various rna substrates  <cit> ; rnasez is responsible for the maturation of the 3'-end of a large family of transfer rnas  <cit> . in e. coli the 3'-terminal phosphate cyclase rtca gene forms an operon with the upstream rtcb gene. expression of rtcab is regulated by rtcr, a gene positioned upstream of rtcab, but transcribed in the opposite direction, encoding a sigma54-dependent regulator  <cit> . rtcba and rtcr genes are conserved in both g51st <dig> and g51acb islands, separated by rntz. interestingly, only rntz is present at the corresponding chromosomal position in strains lacking g <dig> 

in type i restriction systems the three subunits s, m and r, which may variably associate to form a modification methylase or a restriction endonuclease, are encoded by hsd  genes. alternative hsd genes reside in g13st <dig> and g13st <dig>  the former are clustered in one operon, whereas hsdsm and hsdr genes in g13st <dig> are at distance, as frequently found in other species.

homologs of a cytosine dna methyltransferase and a restriction endonuclease, which may constitute a type ii restriction modification system, are encoded by genes residing in g38st <dig> 

the g <dig> islands found in strains  <dig>  ab <dig> and aye are closely related, and all include a crispr  block, flanked by a cas  gene cluster. crisprs are repeated dna sequence blocks found in the genomes of approximately 40% of bacteria, often next to a cluster of cas genes. the crispr/cas system provides a form of acquired immunity against exogenous dna, foreign dna sequences being first integrated at the crispr locus and eventually degraded by cas proteins  <cit> . horizontal transfer of crisprs and associated genes among prokaryotes is documented  <cit> .

gram-negative bacteria contain a variety of genes encoding proteins enriched in dipeptide motifs  hence called vgr. islands encoding vgr-like proteins are found inserted at eight genome variable loci . vgr proteins are associated with ligand-binding proteins at the bacterial surface  <cit> , and are involved in biofilm formation and swarming and swimming motility in burholderia  <cit> . intriguingly, vgr proteins, along with hcp  proteins, are components of the type vi  secretion apparatus, a transport system extensively conserved among gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . secreted vgr proteins assemble a cell-puncturing device analogous to phage tail spikes to deliver effector proteins, and are also able to covalently cross-link host cell actin contributing to t6ss pathogenicity  <cit> . a t6ss gene cluster is conserved in all the analyzed a. baumannii strains.

a. baumannii geis in other species of the acinetobacter genus
acinetobacter baylyi is a non-pathogenic nutritionally versatile soil bacterium. the chromosome of the a. baylyi strain adp <dig> carries metabolic genes involved in the utilization of a large variety of compounds. most of these genes are clustered in five major catabolic islands, grouped in the so called archipelago of catabolic diversity  <cit> . the organization of the a. baylyi and a. baumannii chromosomes is different, and most catabolic islands of a. baylyi are conserved in all a. baumannii strains, although ungrouped, at separate loci . interestingly, some archipelago genes were found in g33st <dig> and g46st <dig>  two accessory dna regions specific of the a. baumannii strain  <dig>  prompted by this finding, we checked whether twenty geis, including g33st <dig> and g46st <dig>  were present in a. baylyi , in the complete genome of the diesel-degrading acinetobacter sp. strain dr <dig>   <cit>  and in the nine draft genomes of the acinetobacter genus deposited at genbank. geis encoding filamentous haemagglutin and vgr-proteins, as those corresponding to cryptic prophages were not searched because of their heterogeneity. the results of the survey are summarized in table  <dig>  seven islands  are conserved in one or more genomes, flanked at one or both sides by the same genes found in a. baumannii, but their dimensions vary, as consequence of gain/loss of dna segments. as expected for mobile dna, some islands were missing, and only flanking genes could be identified . segments of g13st <dig> and g43st <dig> are spread among non-baumannii acinetobacter genomes, thus suggesting that both geis might result from multiple recombination events. recombination likely contributed to the formation of the large dr <dig> island encompassing genes found in g37st <dig> and g37abc, two non-homologous geis encoding enzymes involved in naphthalene degradation and a rtx-type toxin. curiously, the two a. baumannii islands are separated in the dr <dig> island by  <dig> kb dna homologous to fhabc genes found in g38abc.

orfs in each island are referrred to by capital letters. brackets denote orfs flanking genomic islands. conserved genomic regions are highlighted in bold. dots between letters denote that corresponding orfs are not contiguous. #genomic regions larger than those identified in a. baumannii.

a high number of geis is conserved in the genome of the acinetobacter sp. strain dr <dig>  interestingly, dot plot analyses showed that gene order is more similar between a. baumannii ab <dig> strain and acinetobacter sp. strain dr <dig> than between the same a. baumannii strain and a. baylyi . according to rpob sequence analysis, dr- <dig> strain belongs to the a. calcoaceticus-a. baumannii complex, and is closely related  to gen. sp. "between  <dig> and 3"  <cit> .

genomic regions in a. baumannii strains of different genotypes
the distribution of  <dig> genomic islands in the a. baumannii population was monitored by pcr analyses. coding dna regions of 600- <dig> bp, representative of each gei, were amplified from the dna of  <dig> a. baumannii strains associated with  <dig> epidemics that occurred in  <dig> hospitals of the mediterranean area from  <dig> to  <dig>  including the sequenced  <dig> and  <dig> strains used as control. nearly all the strains were representative of cross-transmission episodes, and were isolated with identical pfge types from more than two patients of the same or different institutions  <cit> . strains belong to eight different sts, and 10/ <dig> strains are st <dig>  pcr data are summarized in table  <dig>  taking into account that negative data may denote partial island deletion or polymorphism in sequences targeted by the primers, the conservation of islands seems to vary significantly among the analyzed strains. g <dig> and g <dig> had been found in most strains but not in the two strains assigned to st <dig> and some strains assigned to st <dig>  in contrast, g <dig> is missing in all except one st <dig> strain , and g <dig> is found only in  <dig> strains of different sts. g <dig> seems to be a marker of st <dig> strains, being found in all  <dig> strains assigned to st <dig>  as well in two strains assigned to st <dig>  which is a single locus variant of st <dig>  similarly, g <dig> and g <dig> seem to be markers of st <dig> strains, being found in all  <dig> st <dig> strains. interestingly, the three islands are also present in the single st <dig> strain analyzed. g <dig> is also found in all st <dig> strains and also in strains assigned to st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig>  g <dig> is found in all but not st <dig> and st <dig> strains. all the eleven islands found in the genome of the  <dig> strain are conserved in the other two st <dig> strains analyzed, with the exception of g <dig> and g <dig>  both missing in the  <dig> strain. of the eleven islands, two  are found only in the  <dig> st <dig> strains, six  are also present in strains assigned to other sts. no correlation was found between the pattern of island distribution and pfge profile among strains.

positive or negative pcr amplification are indicated by  <dig> or  <dig>  respectively; nd, not done.

discussion
data reported are in line with the results of previous analyses  <cit> , indicating that the genomes of a. baumannii strains isolated from geographically different regions are closely related and share the same overall organization. shared synteny made possible to align the seven a. baumannii genomes throughout, and obtain a robust chromosomal scaffold by which easily distinguish core and accessory genome components in each strain.

the st <dig> strains acicu and  <dig> exhibit  <dig> % sequence identity, and share the same core and variable genome components. mapped differences are restricted to size changes of ˜ <dig> intergenic regions, which vary in the two strains because they contain a different number of short sequence repeats. a major difference can be ascribed to a >  <dig> kb cp3-like element, found in the  <dig> strain only, the chromosomal location of which has not yet been determined. two cp3-like prophages specific of strains  <dig> and  <dig> have not yet been mapped as well. the acicu and  <dig> strains are however phenotypically distinguishable, since the his-leu replacement at residue  <dig> of the beta subunit of the rna polymerase made the  <dig> strain not susceptible to rifampicin . sequence comparisons revealed that  <dig> coding regions are conserved, at the same chromosomal position, in all a. baumannii genomes. accessory coding regions, including both gei- and mhr-encoded orfs, varies from  <dig>  to  <dig> . in estimating the number of conserved coding regions, it was taken into account that many correspond to a single orf in one genome, but to two or even three adjacent orfs in others, and vice versa. likely most "double orfs" are artifactual, since mutations are known to be introduced by pcr amplification of dna samples prior to sequencing. accessory dna regions correspond to 12% of the  <dig> genome, 19% of the ab <dig> genome, and to 14-16% of all other genomes analysed. although closure of draft genomes and addition of whole genome sequences of other strains may lead to the definition of a few additional geis, data clearly indicate that a. baumannii strains exhibit less variation than e. coli strains, which may share only 60-70% of their coding capacity  <cit> .

many a. baumannii geis have a role in drug resistance, biosynthesis of surface components, iron metabolism, and this may confer advantage in the course of an infection, since successful pathogens encode multiple adhesins, are equipped to sequester iron from the environment and can escape therapy. less clear is the advantage conferred to a. baumannii by other islands. the functional role of the rna 3'-terminal phosphate cyclase, an enzyme conserved among bacteria, archaea and eucarya, encoded by g51st <dig> and g51acb, is debated. the same holds for vgr-like proteins, encoded by several geis, though it is worth noting that six of the ten genomic islands identified in the pathogenic p. aeruginosa pa <dig> strain  <cit>  encode vgr-like proteins. some geis carry genes involved in lipid metabolism. g47abn and g47aby carry genes controlling the formation of cfa and ufa phospholipids. cyclopropanation plays a role in the pathogenesis of mycobacterium tuberculosis, a specific cfa synthase being required to modify the alpha mycolates on the cell envelope, and pathogenic e. coli strains have higher cfa contents and are more resistant to acid shock than non-pathogenic strains  <cit> . g6abc and g6acb carry homologues of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism  conserved at multiple loci in all a. baumannii strains. additional fab genes may confer metabolic advantage, and is worth noting that fab and other gei- <dig> genes reside in oi- <dig>  a genomic island conserved in all o157:h <dig> e. coli strains  <cit> . finally, many geis, most of which unique to the  <dig> strain, carry genes and/or operons controlling specific metabolic pathways, such as naphthalene and phenyl-propionic acid degradation.

several geis correspond to cryptic prophages. of these, a few may have conserved the ability to replicate as phages upon appropriate stimuli, and cp <dig>  cp <dig> and cp <dig> encode lysozyme. however, none exhibited homology to bacteriophages so far identified in a. baumannii  <cit> . few cps are decorated by morons, accessory genes unnecessary for the virus, which may be helpful for the host bacteria when the prophage is integrated in its genome. advantage conferred by morons is debated. paps reductase functions in the assimilatory sulphate reduction pathway, and could serve as a fitness factor under conditions of iron limitation  <cit> , umudc gene could convey a mutator phenotype on the host  <cit> . as previously noted  <cit> , the high variability exhibited by prophage sequences suggests recent insertion/and or rapid loss, and a large pool of phage genomes.

genotypic characterization of a. baumannii isolates during outbreaks occurred in different geographical locations showed the prevalence of clusters of highly similar strains  <cit> . data presented suggest that strains assigned to distinct genotypes according to mlst analysis may harbour specific geis. however, variability exists in the distribution of other genomic regions between a. baumannii strains assigned to the same genotypes, thus suggesting that horizontal gene transfer and recombination may occur between strains of different genotypes.

the identification of sequences homologous to several geis suggests that the genomes of non-baumannii acinetobacter spp. may function as reservoirs of accessory a. baumannii dna. bacteria of the genus acinetobacter, including a. baumannii isolates, are naturally competent  <cit>  and have likely exchanged dna in evolution. a few geis are perfectly conserved in different acinetobacter species, but many vary in size and content, and have been plausibly remodelled both by recombination and insertional events. comparative analyses also demonstrated a marked difference in the genome organization of the non-baumannii acinetobacter sp. baylyi and dr <dig> relatively to a. baumannii.

differences among a. baumannii genomes are also correlated to large strain-specific deletions, which are interestingly associated to selective loss of function. the  <dig> strain lacks muck and tcu genes which enable the growth on cis, cis-muconate and tricarballylate as sole carbon sources  <cit> . the  <dig> strain lacks tau genes, needed to utilize taurine as a sulphur source in sulphate starvation conditions  <cit> , the aye and acicu strains lack genes enabling growth on d-glucarate as sole carbon source  <cit> , the atcc <dig> lacks genes involved in the metabolism of anthranilate, molybdate transport, biosynthesis of the pyrroloquinoline quinone cofactor, chaperone-usher pathway, growth on dicarboxylic acids as the only carbon source  <cit> . all these large deleted regions can alternatively be viewed as geis conserved in the population but missing in one or a few isolates. sequencing of additional a. baumannii isolates will set the issue.

CONCLUSIONS
the definition of the genome components of a. baumannii provides a scaffold to rapidly evaluate the genomic organization of novel clinical a. baumannii isolates. distinguishing conserved from accessory components in a. baumannii chromosomes is a functional framework useful for further investigations on the biology and the genetic organization of this species. changes in island profiling will be useful in genomic epidemiology of a. baumannii population. data provided in this work will facilitate comparisons of a. baumannii isolates, and help to define the features of a. baumannii as species as to pin down its pathogenic traits.
