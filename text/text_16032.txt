BACKGROUND
in the last decades, microarray technology has seen such an explosion of applications as to become a standard tool in biomedical research. it has allowed the discovery of many prognostic genome markers related to the development of pathologies  <cit> . the spreading process has brought a dramatic increase in the number of publicly available datasets  <cit> .

given the high-throughput nature of microarrays, statistical and bioinformatic methods were required to analyse such large amounts of data. initial studies were focused on the identification of differentially expressed genes and their significance in many experimental designs . this analysis is time-consuming and sometimes ineffective because derived gene lists have to be interpreted, searching for patterns of genes that have similar function or are involved in particular processes  <cit> . this approach revealed that genes that are identified as differentially expressed often do not correlate with the phenotype under investigation. furthermore, their consistency often decreases when different studies on the same biological issue are compared   <cit> .

meta-analysis may be broadly defined as the quantitative review and synthesis of the results of related but independent studies  <cit> . different groups demonstrated its applicability to microarray data. rhodes  <cit>  applied meta-analysis to combine four datasets on prostate cancer to determine genes that are differentially expressed between clinically localized prostate and benign tissue. parmigiani  <cit>  performed a cross-study comparison of gene expression for the molecular classification of lung cancer. park and stegall  <cit>  combined publicly available datasets and their own microarray datasets to investigate the detection of cytokine gene expression in human kidney. meta-analysis studies clearly showed that the different lists of differentially expressed genes from different studies overlap poorly due to the complicated experimental variables embedded in array experiments. this suggests that a pathway/gene set-based approach could improve the performance of this type of comparison  <cit> .

to improve microarray data analysis, the first tools developed were based on the integration of external genomic information such as gene location  <cit> , ontological annotations  <cit>  or sequence features  <cit> .

several methods were devised to analyse gene expression as a function of physical location of genes on chromosomes. these approaches, collectively referred to as "chromosome mapping", were applied to microarray data of cancer studies. the studies identified regions with transcriptional imbalances that reflected large chromosomal aberrations typical of such pathologies. examples of these applications are the locally adaptive statistical procedure   <cit>  and the microarray chromosome analysis tool   <cit> . lap was applied to compare gene expression data of acute myeloid leukaemia  with and without trisomy on chromosome  <dig>  lap correctly identified the over-expressed region on chromosome  <dig> of patients where dna amplification was present. macat was applied to compare t and b lymphocytes from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia , identifying a marked over-expression of the region that contains genes of class ii major histocompatibility complex  in the b lineage. recently, a chromosome mapping approach based on the haar wavelet transformation   <cit>  was applied to a dataset of huntington's disease. the study demonstrated that the aberrant interaction between the mutant huntingtin protein and its transcriptional co-activators, such as histone acetyltransferase, leads to large areas of transcriptional imbalances  <cit> .

a more popular method for the integration of gene expression profiles with additional information is based on ontological and pathway annotations and is called gene set analysis . this approach evaluates gene expression profiles among groups of related genes , seeking coordinated changes in the expression levels of subsets of gene members. usually, gsa has three main steps: a) computing associations of each expression pattern with a phenotype; b) computing enrichment scores for analysed gene sets; c) computing the global p-value and q-value for every tested gene set based on the appropriate permutation test. several implementations of the gsa approach are now available, such as the algorithms developed by subramanian   <cit> , tian   <cit> , efron   <cit>  and goeman with global test  <cit> .

recently, szabó  <cit>  combined mrna and comparative genome hybridization results, revealing that the major pathogenetic pathways involved in adrenocortical tumours are related to regions with aberrant gene expression. this work is an example of how the integration of different genomic information is useful to gain new insight into a pathology by exploiting available datasets. we believe that an important shortcoming of szabó's described method is that it is based only on differentially expressed genes thus defining a strict cut-off without considering the actual level of expression.

here, we propose a new procedure, stepath , that scores and integrates chromosomal region activation as an a priori step before performing gsa. the result of this analysis is a global expression value of gene sets weighted by chromosomal region activation. the plasticity of the chromosome architecture was recently debated due to the identification of transcription factories  <cit> , but there are no bioinformatic algorithms that consider this aspect in the gene set analysis. three public datasets were tested. we demonstrated that the combination of gene expression profiles, chromosome mapping and gene set analysis produced gene set scores suitable to compare different studies in a meta-analysis approach.

RESULTS
stepath algorithm
we implemented a new gene expression analysis method that takes into account i) the activation or repression of genes in chromosome regions  <cit>  and ii) the evidence that intensive transcription at one locus frequently spills over in physically adjacent loci  <cit> . the stepath algorithm allows scoring and integrating these aspects of gene regulation  before performing gene set analysis . gene set scores from step  <dig> can be used for meta-analysis studies .

step 1
to integrate physical locations of genes, stepath measures the association of a gene expression profile with a phenotype  statistics  <cit> ), rescaling it on the expression levels of the neighbour genes. we analysed each gene in relation to the y closest up- and down-regulated genes. using a permutational approach, we tested the following hypothesis: h <dig>  the region did not show differential expression; h <dig>  the region is differentially expressed.

step 2
after the computation of chromosome profiles using significant regions, stepath performs a gene set analysis using sam statistics  <cit>  smoothed according to the chromosome profiles. we defined this step as a gentle integration of the chromosome profile because the smoothing process does not penalize gene scores; instead, it attributes to gene members of differentially expressed regions an additional score proportional to their own sam score and to the local profile. this method enhances particular signals along chromosomes that are buried in the background due either to sample or technical heterogeneity that could profoundly affect microarray reproducibility.

using the smoothed statistic, an up- and down-regulation value for every gene set was calculated. as gsa relies on the quality of annotation and dimension of gene sets, it is possible that the signal of a small group of coordinated genes becomes lost in non-specific signals. if this could be an analysis limitation, we increased gsa power by adopting two approaches: a) we analysed the most-used database repositories for gene sets, and b) we extracted portions of pathways showing coordinated expression.

a) we have compiled gene sets from gene ontology   <cit> , kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit> , biocyc  <cit> , biocarta  <cit> , superarray  <cit>  and wikipathways  <cit> . the resulting database includes cellular component, molecular function and biological process  sets, manually curated functional pathways from biocarta, metabolic pathways from kegg and specific pathways for quantitative real time pcr  and microarray experiments from superarray. if different annotations of the same biological aspect may produce redundancies, they also retain specific differences and provide both robustness and specificity when correlated simultaneously to a phenotype .

b) according to efron  <cit>  and later confirmed by song  <cit> , splitting up and down portions of gene sets improves the statistical power of approaches where the mean of a statistic is used to score gene sets.

up- and down-regulation scores were independently tested for significance using a gene-based permutation approach. we tested the null hypothesis, h <dig>  that the gene set shows the same pattern of association with the phenotype compared to the rest of the genes. the q-values were computed using the benjamini hochberg algorithm  <cit> .

step 3
in meta-analysis studies, step  <dig> primarily aims to determine if the results from one study are confirmed in other independent studies.

for an individual study, the stepath procedure  produces a list of gene sets with summarization values  and an associated q-value. different pathologies can then be directly compared using the gene set summarization values produced for individual studies.

individual analysis of leukaemia dataset
we tested stepath on an expression profile dataset of patients affected by acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  gene).

raw expression data  were downloaded from the geo database , processed using a gene-based custom chip definition file   <cit>  to better define the chip  <cit> , and normalized using the robust multichip average  expression summary  <cit> . we recovered expression values for  <dig>  genes. using stepath, we directly compared all with  and without mll translocation , seeking evidence specific for mll translocation. genes without chromosomal location information and genes on chromosome y were filtered out because paucity of gene expression data precludes the application of chromosome mapping.

this dataset was used to analyse the performance of the main modules implemented in stepath: chromosome mapping  and gene set analysis .

step 1
using our implementation, we were able to identify a spectrum of possible imbalanced regions across all chromosomes . we identified the down-regulation of the region that contains the mll gene . mll is characterized by a chromosome rearrangement, disrupting its correct localization and transcriptional regulation  <cit> .

our method highlights interesting imbalanced regions that contain genes involved in all pathology: 1) the region containing the homeobox genes  on chromosome  <dig> , and 2) the region containing meis homeobox  <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> .

as discussed by zangrando  <cit> , hox genes and meis <dig> are up-regulated in all, representing a discriminant signature that separates all/mll+ from all/mll-. another gene involved in the discrimination between all/mll+ and all/mll- patients is the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan  <dig> . ng <dig> encodes for a transmembrane protein located in the leukaemic cell membrane and proposed as a marker for rapid classification of all with mll translocation  <cit> . zangrando  <cit>  used sam and predicted analysis of microarray   <cit>  to identify this discriminant gene. our method pointed out this gene as well, evidencing the goodness of our algorithm .

we compared our results with the most used approaches to detect imbalanced regions, namely lap  <cit>  and macat  <cit> . we ran these algorithms using the suggested number of permutations  and also with our settings . different numbers of permutations did not result in relevant differences in the detected regions.

the comparison between lap results  and stepath chromosome mapping  shows that our approach identifies more regions than lap. we decided to preserve information since this is not an independent procedure, but it is later piped into a gene set analysis. even if lap identifies a smaller number of imbalanced regions, these span larger chromosome portions, such as those on chromosome  <dig> , causing difficult interpretation of the results.

in contrast with lap, our procedure limits imbalanced regions to small portions of interest that are easier to visualize and relate to the studied phenotype. indeed, the lap procedure fails to identify as imbalanced the mll region on chromosome  <dig> and the hox genes cluster on chromosome  <dig> . lap identified meis <dig> region on chromosome  <dig>  but this region spans about  <dig> mbp . our algorithm reduces the region to ~ <dig> mbp , focusing on truly disease-related genes. these results demonstrate that our algorithm seems to be more sensitive than lap in the identification of important imbalanced regions involved in all.

furthermore, our procedure reaches a greater sensitivity than macat in the detection of regions on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the profile of chromosome  <dig> produced with macat  is greatly perturbed, and it is difficult to identify interesting regions. macat also failed to evidence the mll region .

step 2
we completed the stepath procedure by integrating chromosomal profile information in the module that performs gene set analysis.

the choice between gene  and sample permutations   <cit>  and significance analysis of function and expression   <cit> ) has been an object of debate in the literature, as demonstrated by efron's  <cit>  and goeman's  <cit>  papers. after evaluating the limits and peculiarities of both permutational approaches, we chose the gene permutation model that seems to better fit our null hypothesis . we compared results obtained from stepath with two other implementations of gsa both based on gene label permutations: gsea implemented in the limma r package  <cit>  and sigpathway  <cit> . stepath is the only procedure that can identify the activated hox gene set . dysregulation of hox gene family members was found to be a dominant mechanism of leukaemic transformation induced by chimeric mll oncogenes  <cit> .

rank comparison of tested gsa for the most  <dig> up-regulated gene sets. stepath is the only procedure that was able to identify the activated hox gene set with a best rank using the corrected expression value based on chromosome profile.

to evaluate the contribution of chromosome profile information, we performed our gsa procedure  with and without chromosome profile correction. in both cases, stepath was able to identify the hox gene set probably due to a separate evaluation of up- and down-regulated genes. however, the integration of gene location with gene set analysis allows the combination of different levels of biological information  and helps to correctly identify disease-related genes, since they have a different position in a rank evaluation . to confirm this effect, we also ran limma gsea using the chromosome profile correction.  <dig> % of the common gene sets resulted with lower q-values when the analysis was integrated by the correction for chromosome profile. furthermore, this correction was able to filter out the glyoxylate cycle, present in bacteria, fungi, yeast and plants . this demonstrates that the correction enhances the discovery of disease-related genes, also filtering for apparently not informative pathways .

limma gsea algorithm was run using the chromosome profile correction. significance of the differentially expressed gene sets increases in comparison with results obtained without introducing chromosome profile correction, suggesting that it targets disease-related genes.

meta-analysis of lgmds
we applied stepath in a meta-analysis approach involving expression datasets of limb girdle muscular dystrophies type 2a , type 2b  and type 2i . we built a meta-dataset combining lgmd2a from two distinct datasets. the first was published by bakay  <cit>  ; the second dataset was published by sáenz  <cit>  . meta-dataset details are listed in table  <dig>  downloaded cel files were processed using gene-based custom cdf  <cit> . we retrieved expression for  <dig>  distinct genes. following a visual inspection of the quantiles distribution , we excluded  <dig> control samples from dataset gse <dig> . gene expression data were then globally normalized using the rma procedure  <cit> .

general information about muscular disease meta-dataset. s: skeletal muscular disease dataset; l: lgmd analysis.

we applied  <dig> individual stepath procedures to ctrls vs lgmd2a , ctrls vs lgmd2a , ctrls vs lgmd2b  and ctrls vs lgmd2i , where ctrls are normal muscle controls from healthy donors . ensembl features with no corresponding entrezgene ids as well as features/genes belonging to the y chromosome were filtered out. we used stepath scores to perform gene set meta-analysis  .

in general, methods for meta-analysis were based on the union or the intersection of lists of differentially expressed genes derived from multiple studies of the same biological issue. however, these lists have little overlap because of biological and technical variability  <cit> , while pathway analysis often generates improved consistency  <cit> . an explanation for the reduced discrepancies in the results of the microarray data based on biological gene sets analysis, compared with the over imposition of the groups of differentially expressed genes derived from different studies, may be the correlation of differentially expressed genes. in fact, the differences in their relative expression may be so small that the choice of top-ranked genes is highly dependent on the studies or analysis method from which genes are inferred, as reported in  <cit> . moreover there is the possibility that gene sets with no differentially expressed genes  will show an aberrant global expression pattern because most of the genes in the set have an even small, but coordinated change  allowing their identification in different studies and increasing their comparability.

recently, shen  <cit>  proposed the integrated meta-analysis of pathway enrichment approach , combining statistical significance at the gene and pathway level based on a gene-wise and sample-wise permutation test. our framework is focused on this aspect of meta-analysis, but it introduces the possibility to compare different conditions, highlighting peculiarities of each one.

to produce the main gene set signature , we chose gse <dig>  as a reference study. the signature was composed of  <dig> gene sets:  <dig> gene ontology and  <dig> biological pathways that were used to build the gene set matrix .

cluster analysis of the gene set matrix  shows that the two lgmd2as from different datasets are linked, and lgmd2b and lgmd2i segregate separately .

we then performed unsupervised cluster analysis  <cit>  on gene expression data. this analysis highlighted two main branches that separate gse <dig> and gse <dig> datasets . this demonstrates that background noise and the presence of a batch effect is strong enough to overcome disease-specific signals at gene expression levels . moreover, cluster analysis failed to separate pathologies  using significant differentially expressed genes only .

our approach overcomes the main limitations of gene expression meta-analysis and demonstrates that it is useful to reveal gene set signatures that discriminate different pathologies. in this way, we can evaluate the main signature discrimination/association power, projecting it into the second study .

meta-analysis of skeletal muscular diseases
we extended the analysis performed for lgmds including more variability with different skeletal muscular diseases .

raw expression files  were downloaded from the geo database  <cit>   and processed using a gene-based custom cdf, as previously discussed. normalized gene expression for  <dig>  genes was used in the stepath analysis. extended datasets were used to evaluate if increased variability affects the meta-analysis procedure. we extracted signatures from all skeletal muscle diseases in the dataset gse <dig> to build the mgs used in the cluster analysis. cluster analysis showed that increased variability of initial samples did not affect clustering results since lgmds still clustered together; different datasets of lgmd2a were still in close proximity .

we compared stepath meta-analysis results with a meta-analysis approach based on different gsa scores. similarly for stepath, we built a mgs matrix using scores derived by both sigpathway and gsea . clustering results of the mgs matrix from both sigpathway and gsea failed to co-segregate the two lgmd2a datasets and the entire group of lgmds .

gene set clusters were analysed focusing on both shared and peculiar pathology responses. down-regulated gene sets show several clusters with the same expression level. these gene sets mainly refer to aerobic respiration, the production of atp and mitochondria . these results are in agreement with many microarray studies on skeletal muscle dystrophies  <cit>  and a previous meta-analysis work that we performed to detect muscle atrophy signatures  <cit> . in many skeletal muscle pathologies, the rate of degradation of contractile proteins becomes greater than the rate of replacement, causing atrophy and modifying the balance requested for the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass. ubiquitination function involved in protein degradation and gene sets for oxidative stress and mitochondrial function appear to be up-regulated, yet they are not discriminative among the pathologies. gene sets involved in oxidoreductase activity , scavenger receptor activity  and regulation of amino acids  are some examples . recently, kramerova  <cit>  postulated that lgmd2a and other dystrophies  are characterized by energy deficit and increased oxidative stress. we highlighted the activation of gene sets involved in antioxidant activity like go_mf:  <dig>  go_mf:  <dig> and go_mf: <dig> that referred to oxidoreductase activity.

dysferlinopathy  was characterized as dystrophies where dysferlin-deficient cells show abnormalities in vesicular trafficking  <cit> . lgmd2b also presents muscle inflammation with muscular monocytes and macrophages that show an increased phagocytic activity  <cit> . efficient phagocytic activity depends on the presence of the coat protein complex type i   <cit> , a complex that plays an essential role in the trafficking of membrane vesicles. our procedure reveals this relation between vesicle trafficking impairment and enhanced phagocytosis in lgmd2b as is demonstrated by a marked up-regulation of go terms that refer to copi-coated vesicles  .

to search for discriminative gene sets among lgmd2a  and the other skeletal muscular diseases, we performed a template matching search  <cit> . in figure  <dig> are reported hierarchical clusters of gene sets identified with p-value ≤  <dig> .

recently, beckman and spencer  <cit>  proposed that capn <dig> is involved in sarcomeric protein turnover and in the maintenance of sarcomere integrity. collagen , collagen binding  and fibrillar collagen  gene sets, involved in the maintenance of mechanical stability of muscle structure, sarcomere , striated muscle thick filament , a band  and contractile fiber  involved in the contraction process, appear to be up-regulated in lgmd2a . gene sets previously described are also altered in lgmd2b patients that present mutations in the dysferlin gene , which interacts with capn <dig>  a secondary reduction of capn <dig> that can affect sarcomere structure stability in lgmd2b patients has also been demonstrated  <cit> .

implementation
all functions to perform stepath analysis are written in r , and they are freely available as r package at http://gefu.cribi.unipd.it/papers/stepath under the agpl <dig> licence. the implementation depends on bioconductor  <cit>  version  <dig>   and samr r package .

the present implementation is microarray platform-independent and potentially could be applied to any kind of gene-phenotype association score .

CONCLUSIONS
the algorithm we developed allows the analysis of gene expression data by integrating supplementary biological information to identify gene co-expression along the chromosomes and to perform a gene set analysis. the integration was initially tested on a leukaemia dataset, highlighting interesting imbalanced regions containing genes involved in all pathology: 1) mll region on chromosome 11; 2) the region containing hox gene cluster on chromosome 7; and 3) the region containing meis <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  these regions are specifically enhanced by the stepath algorithm and not by lap or macat.

the second integration was tested on gene expression datasets both from leukaemia and skeletal muscle diseases evidencing the importance of integration of the chromosome profiles in the gene set analysis. integrating two biological aspects in the stepath algorithm , we have demonstrated that stepath produces gene set expression scores that are suitable to directly compare different diseases and studies to perform meta-analyses.

we applied stepath and the meta-analysis approach to limb girdle muscular dystrophies , highlighting the co-segregation of two different studies of lgmd2a patients, and to a meta-dataset for inflammatory myopathies composed of both affymetrix arrays and unpublished custom oligo arrays. results of the study of inflammatory myopathies will be discussed in a separate paper.
