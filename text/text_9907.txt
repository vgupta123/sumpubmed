BACKGROUND
rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance poses a major global threat to public health and the economy  <cit> . excessive use and misuse of antibiotics in medicine and food production contribute to the rise of drug resistant pathogens  <cit> . control and prevention of antibiotic resistance call for holistic strategies including judicious use of antimicrobials, effective diagnostic tools, and novel therapeutic agents that are less likely to trigger resistance  <cit> .

beta-defensins are small, cationic, antimicrobial peptides found in different living organisms . these endogenous peptides constitute the first line of innate defense against pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses  <cit> . beta-defensins possess various biological properties, including broad-spectrum microbicidal activity, neutralization of lps, activation of macrophages and dendritic cells, chemoattraction of dendritic cells, monocytes, and t-lymphocytes to the site of infection  <cit> . the microbicidal activity of defensins is achieved mainly through initial electrostatic attraction between positively charged amino acid residues of the peptides and negatively charged microbial surface components and subsequent microbial membrane damage which is followed by interacting with intracellular targets . the chemotactic function of β-defensins is mediated by cc-chemokine receptors, such as ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> . these natural antimicrobial peptides with complex mechanisms of action represent potentially a novel class of antimicrobials  <cit> . however, several challenges must be addressed in order to develop β-defensins for therapeutic use which include retaining the biological activities under physiological conditions and the ease of production and purification of recombinant or synthetic peptides  <cit> .

most defensin peptides characterized to date have a net positive charge, ranging from + <dig> to + <dig>  and hydrophobicity of approximately 30-50%  <cit> . it has been reported that the three conserved disulfide bridges are required for the chemotactic function, but not the antimicrobial activity . data from our laboratory showed that reduced  avbds are fully active against bacterial pathogens whereas avbds without correctly folded disulfide bridges are not  <cit> . to further understand the structural and functional characteristics of avbds, seven analogues were designed by replacing the negatively charged residues  and/or cysteines  with either positively charged residues , hydrophobic residues  or isosteric amino acids . the antimicrobial and chemotactic activities and salt-resistance of the analogues as well as their wild type parent peptides have been evaluated.

methods
design and synthesis of peptides
the three dimensional structures of avbds were predicted by using the i-tasser program . the distribution of positively charged amino acids were evaluated using pymol . group  <dig> analogues, including avbd-12a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> were linear peptides, in which the six cysteines  were replaced with structurally similar amino acid residues  as follows: avbd-12a1: a5a12a17a27a34a <dig>  avbd-12a2: s5s12s17a27a34a <dig>  and avbd-12a3: a5a12a17s27s34s <dig>  additional modifications were introduced to these analogues to alter peptide hydrophobicity and charge. in avbd-12a <dig>  the four negatively charged amino acid residues  were replaced with one polar and three hydrophobic amino acid residues . in avbd-12a <dig> and avbd-12a <dig>  d3d8e21e <dig> were substituted with positively charged residues r3k8k21r <dig>  group  <dig> analogues, including avbd-12a <dig>  avbd-12a <dig> and avbd-12a <dig> had reduced number of disulfide bridges without any additional modifications. to remove disulfide bridges, the cysteine residues  of avbd- <dig> were replaced with isosteric α-aminobutyric acids  to create avbd-12a <dig> , a <dig> , and a <dig> . group  <dig> included a single hybrid peptide, namely avbd-12/ <dig>  this analogue was designed using the backbone of avbd- <dig>  in which the negatively charged amino acid residues  of avbd- <dig> were replaced with amino acids  of avbd- <dig> at the corresponding positions. the hydrophobicity and charge of avbd analogues at neutral ph were calculated using peptide  <dig>   and peptide property calculator , respectively.

all peptides were custom synthesized using the standard solid phase 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl  method and purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography  . the analogues avbd-12a <dig>  −a <dig>  avbd-12/ <dig>  avbd- <dig> and avbd- <dig> with varying numbers of cysteine residues were subjected to oxidative folding as described previously  <cit> . electrospray ionization mass spectrometry  was performed to confirm the correct formation of disulfide bridges between cys1-cys <dig>  cys2-cys <dig> and cys3-cys <dig>  the purity of the synthetic avbd analogues was over  <dig> % as verified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  .

antimicrobial activity of avbd analogues

escherichia coli , pseudomonas aeruginosa , salmonella enteric serovar typhimurium  and staphylococcus aureus  were used to assess the antimicrobial activity of avbd analogues. all bacterial strains were grown on luria-bertani  agar plates or trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood  plates at 37 °c. antimicrobial activity was determined by a colony counting assay  <cit> . in brief, bacteria were resuspended in 100-fold diluted mueller hinton ii broth with 5 mm nacl  to obtain a final bacterial concentration of 2 × 105 cfu/ml. twenty-five microliters of bacterial suspension and 25 μl of avbd analogue solution were mixed in the wells of a 96-well polypropylene microtiter plate . the final peptide concentrations were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 128 μg/ml. the minimal growth medium without avbd peptide was included as a negative control. the bacterial-peptide mixtures were incubated at 37 °c for 2 h, ten-fold serially diluted and plated on lb agar plates. the numbers of bacteria colonies were enumerated after 16 h of incubation at 37 °c. antimicrobial activity was expressed as percent of killing using the following formula:  / cfucontrol × 100%. to assess the resistance of avbd analogues to sodium chloride , antimicrobial assays were carried out in the presence of 5 mm, 50 mm, 100 mm or 150 mm nacl. all assays were performed in triplicate.

minimum inhibitory concentrations of avbd analogues
the minimum inhibitory concentrations  of avbds were determined according to the guidelines of the clinical and laboratory standards institute   <cit> . the muller hinton ii broth used in standard mic assays contained 20–25 mg/l of calcium and 10– <dig>  mg/l of magnesium. modified mics of avbds were also determined under a low-salt and low-nutrient condition by using 100× diluted muller hinton ii broth containing  <dig>  mg/l of calcium,  <dig>  mg/l magnesium and 5 mm  nacl. mic obtained under the low-salt and low-nutrient condition was referred to as mic-ls. avbd peptides were two-fold serially diluted  in a 96-well microtiter plate. an equal volume  of bacterial suspension was added to each well of the plate. the final bacterial concentration in the wells was 5 × 105 cfu/ml. the plate was incubated at 37 °c for 24 h and the lowest concentration that completely prevented visible bacteria growth was recorded. to complement mic-ls assays, the minimum bactericidal concentrations  were evaluated by sub-culturing the contents of the first two clear wells obtained in the mic-ls assay onto lb agar plates. all assays were conducted in triplicate. the lowest peptide concentration inhibiting more than 99% of bacterial growth was defined as mbc-ls. avbd analogues were regarded as bactericidal if the mbc was no more than four times the mic  <cit> .

susceptibility to nacl
the impact of nacl on the killing activity of avbds was assessed at nacl concentrations ranging from  <dig> to 150 mm. increasing nacl concentration had less adverse impact on the killing activity of avbd-12a <dig> and avbd-12a <dig> which had a higher net positive charge  and hydrophobicity  than avbd- <dig> . avbd-12a <dig>  the most hydrophobic  analogue, showed similar or increased susceptibility to nacl, compared to avbd- <dig> . susceptibility to nacl was also influenced by the bacterial species under investigation. at 150 mm nacl, avbd-12a <dig> and avbd-12a <dig> retained approximately 80% of killing potency against e. coli and p. aeruginosa, but only 30% to 60% of killing activity against s. typhimurium and s. aureus . avbd-12a <dig>  avbd-12a <dig>  and avbd-12a <dig> with fewer disulfide bridges were equally or more susceptible to nacl than avbd- <dig> . avbd-12/ <dig> with the backbone of avbd- <dig> and increased net positive charge  resembled avbd- <dig> instead of avbd- <dig> .fig.  <dig> effect of nacl on the antimicrobial activity of group one avbds. bacteria were treated with group one analogues in the presence of 5 mm, 50 mm, 100 mm or 150 mm nacl. avbds were used at the following concentrations: 16 μg/ml against e. coli , 32 μg/ml against p. aeruginosa  and s. typhimurium  and 64 μg/ml against s. aureus . these concentrations were chosen to ensure more than 50% of killing of inoculum by majority of analogues. results are expressed as percent of killing compared to the no-salt control. data shown are means ± sd . statistical analysis was performed using the one-way analysis of variance  followed by duncan’s test for multiple comparisons using software spss version  <dig>  . asterisks indicate statistically significant difference among different treatment groups

discussion
due to the broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, lps-neutralizing property, immunomodulatory function and the low cell cytotoxicity, defensins may serve as natural antimicrobial peptides or templates for novel drug design  <cit> . it has been reported that the three conserved disulfide bridges are required for the chemotactic function, but not the antimicrobial activity of mammalian β-defensins . however, data from our previous studies indicate that the correct formation of disulfide bridges via oxidative folding is required for maximum antimicrobial activity  <cit> . in an effort to identify key structural components important to the antimicrobial and chemotactic activities of avbds, we compared the predicted three dimensional structures of avbds with the well characterized structure of human beta-defensin  <dig> . it was previously shown that the n-terminal α-helix and an adjacent β2-β <dig> loop form a contiguous binding surface for ccr <dig>  <cit> . the presence of a similar ccr <dig> binding domain in avbd- <dig> may account for the chemotactic activity of avbd- <dig> for both avian and mammalian immune cells because avbd- <dig> which had an n-terminal coil instead of the α-helix was chemotactic only for avian cells  <cit> .

to further understand the structure-activity relationship, we designed and evaluated seven synthetic analogues of avbd- <dig>  in the first group of analogues, disulfide bridges were removed by replacing cysteines with structurally similar residues  whereas peptide hydrophobicity and charge were increased by substituting negatively charged residues with hydrophobic  or positively charged residues . all members of the first group demonstrated stronger antimicrobial activity than their parent peptide avbd- <dig>  indicating that cysteine-free  avbds with a high net positive charge and moderate hydrophobicity can be potent antimicrobial agents. such linear peptides can be synthesized without oxidative folding which simplifies the production process and reduces cost. in the present study, anti-s. typhimurium activity of avbd-12a <dig> decreased significantly as peptide concentration increased from 64 μg/ml to 128 μg/ml . similar results were obtained repeatedly, suggesting that the decrease was unlikely caused by technical errors. we hypothesize that avbd-12a <dig>  the most hydrophobic  peptide may form aggregates which interferes with peptide binding to salmonella membrane components, resulting in a reduction in antimicrobial potency. interestingly, avbd-12a <dig> and avbd-12a <dig> with identical charge and hydrophobicity, but different locations of three alanine and three serine residues  showed significant difference in antimicrobial and chemotactic activities. structural analysis of avbd-12a <dig> revealed an outward protrusion of r <dig> side chain and parallel twist f <dig> aromatic ring. we hypothesize that the outward protrusion of a positively charged residue and an adjacent aromatic ring enhances the interaction between avbd-12a <dig> and microbial surface components or ccr <dig>  thereby facilitating antimicrobial and chemotactic functions.

to assess the role of disulfide bridges independent of charge and hydrophobicity, we replaced cysteine residues with isosteric α-aminobutyric acids  to create group  <dig> analogues. our data indicated that missing even one conserved disulfide bridge resulted in a significant reduction in avbd’s chemotactic activity. elimination of two or three disulfide bridges completely abolished the chemotactic activity for both avian ccr2-positive cells and murine immature dendritic cells. it has been shown that c <dig> and c <dig> essential to the formation of first and second disulfide bridges are located at the ccr <dig> binding center  <cit> . thus substitution of c with u may have disrupted the ccr <dig> binding surface, resulting in the loss of chemotactic activity. our data also showed that removal of disulfide bridges had varying degrees of negative impact on avbd’s antimicrobial activity. analogue avbd-12a <dig> missing the c1-c <dig> bridge was nearly inactive against s. typhimurium. these results collectively suggest that all three disulfide bridges are needed in the natural form of avbds to maintain tertiary structural features critical to interacting with microbial surface components and ccrs on immune cells.

besides antimicrobial assays, sem was performed to illustrate the killing mechanisms of avbd- <dig> analogues. treatment of s. typhimurium with avbd-12a <dig> and avbd-12/ <dig>  and wild-type avbd- <dig> and avbd- <dig> caused similar ultrastructural changes, including cell deformation and membrane damage. giant cells were only observed among treatment groups, indicating membrane permeabilization is an essential step in the killing of microbes by avbds.

salt sensitivity is a major obstacle to the application of β-defensins as chemotherapeutic agents. different strategies have been explored to increase the resistance of beta-defensins to salts, such as n-terminal deletion  <cit> , combining sequences of hbd- <dig> and salt-resistant θ-defensin  <cit>  and replacement of tryptophan or histidine with a bulky amino acid β-naphthylalanine  <cit> . in the present study, we found that increasing peptide charge significantly reduced the impact of nacl on the antimicrobial efficacy of avbd-12a <dig> and avbd-12a <dig>  however, the activity against s. typhimurium was still severely inhibited by physiological concentration of nacl , suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in killing different bacterial species.

in the present study, we also determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations  of avbds. using the standard muller hinton ii broth, the mics of the parent avbds and the most potent analogue avbd-12a <dig> were much higher than the mic values obtained under the low-salt and low-nutrient condition. we hypothesize that interference of initial peptide-bacteria interactions by cationic salts as well as enzymatic degradation or modification of avbds during bacterial growth in a nutrient rich mueller-hinton broth might have contributed to the decreased antimicrobial activity. it has been shown that human cathelicidin ll- <dig> could be hydrolyzed by s. aureus protease or cleaved by metalloprotease, gelatinase or cysteine protease produced by other bacterial species  <cit> . proteolytic degradation is one of the main mechanisms that both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria use to evade host antimicrobial peptide killing . further modification is clearly needed to improve the efficacy of avbd-12a <dig> as an antimicrobial agent. it is noteworthy that all avbd analogues remain non-cytotoxic to avian and mammalian cells.

CONCLUSIONS
the three conserved disulfide bridges maintaining the tertiary structure of natural avbds are required not only for the chemotactic activity, but also for maximum antimicrobial activity. avbd-12a <dig> with increased net positive charge and a ccr2-binding domains  demonstrated potent antimicrobial activity and retained partial chemotactic property. analogue avbd-12a <dig> may serve as a template for the design of novel antimicrobial peptides as therapeutic agents for both avian and mammalian hosts.
