BACKGROUND
chaperones assist the folding of newly synthesized proteins to the native state and provide a quality control system that refolds misfolded and aggregated proteins. in the e. coli cytosol, the folding of newly synthesized proteins is assisted by the ribosome-associated trigger factor, the dnak system , and the groel system   <cit> . kje and els also prevent aggregation and promote refolding of preexisting proteins which lost their native conformation e.g. due to thermal denaturation or intrinsic instability  <cit> . kje furthermore cooperates with clpb to solubilize aggregated proteins and refold them to the native state in a concerted action with els  <cit> . moreover, the small heat shock proteins  of e. coli, ibpa and ibpb , intercalate into protein aggregates and thereby facilitate the kje/clpb dependent disaggregation and refolding  <cit> .

the overproduction of recombinant proteins in host cells often leads to their misfolding and aggregation  <cit> . folding problems of overproduced client proteins can be caused by limitations in the chaperone capacity of the host cells. several attempts were made to increase the yields of correctly folded, and hence soluble, recombinant proteins by the co-overproduction of individual chaperones in producing cells, however only with a limited success. for example, the co-overproduction of els increases the solubility of human orp <dig>  human lysozyme, p50csk protein tyrosine kinase, phosphomannose isomerase and fusion protein pres2-s'-β-galactosidase and maize protoporphyrinogen ix oxidase  <cit> . the co-overproduction of kje increases the solubility of endostatin, human orp <dig>  transglutaminase and pres2-s'-β-galactosidase  <cit> .

to assess the full potential of the cellular network of molecular chaperones for the production of soluble recombinant proteins we performed a systematic analysis of the combined power of the major cytosolic chaperone systems of e. coli, kje, els, clpb and ibpab. we did not include trigger factor in our analyses since it acts through a 1: <dig> association with ribosomes and is already present in three-fold molar excess over ribosomes in wild type cells  <cit> .

RESULTS
we first investigated a combination of the two major chaperone systems with folding activity, kje and els, and the co-operating chaperone with disaggregating activity, clpb. to allow for regulated overproduction of chaperones we generated a set of compatible plasmids, which  differ in copy number ,  express chaperone genes under control of a strong  or weaker  promoter combined with the laco <dig> operator   <cit> , and  encode the laciq repressor gene. this set of plasmids was designed to allow for iptg-inducible expression of chaperone genes in different combinations , and to produce chaperones at the stoichiometries, which are optimal for their folding activity  <cit> .

host cell were transformed with plasmids in  <dig> combinations. combination  <dig>  for overproduction of kje; combination  <dig>  for overproduction of kje and clpb; combination  <dig>  for overproduction of els; combination  <dig>  for overproduction of kje, clpb and high amounts of els; combination  <dig>  for overproduction of kje with clpb and lower amounts of els . continuous growth of these cells in medium containing  <dig> μm iptg resulted in an increase of dnak , clpb , groel  over wild type levels , without causing apparent growth defects . host cells containing different combinations of these plasmids were subsequently transformed with plasmids expressing  <dig> different recombinant genes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin  from iptg-controlled promoters. the encoded proteins include monomers and oligomers, cytosolic, membrane bound and secreted proteins, full-length, fragmented and fused proteins  , with molecular weights ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig> kda. proteins were hexa-histidine tagged to allow affinity purification of the soluble fractions.

 <dig> of the  <dig> target proteins tested showed an increase in the final yield of purified, soluble protein upon co-overproduction of chaperones . of these  <dig> proteins,  <dig> showed a  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold increase in solubility, and  <dig> proteins  became soluble only upon chaperone co-overproduction, allowing its purification under native conditions. for  <dig> of the  <dig> target proteins the highest increase in solubility was achieved by co-overproduction of all three kje, els and clpb chaperone systems in combination  <dig> or  <dig>  with a higher success rate  for combination  <dig>  which produces higher levels of els. for  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins the highest increase in solubility was obtained with combination  <dig>  which overproduces els alone, and in only one case each the combination  <dig>  or  <dig>  yielded the highest degree of solubility of the substrate protein. taken together, these results show that chaperone co-overproduction is successful in about 50% of the proteins tested, with kje, clpb and els being the most successful combination. we did not observe any influence of the protein fusion tags, which have been fused to some of the recombinant proteins, on the efficiency of chaperone mediated solubility increase . furthermore, identical beneficial effects of chaperone co-production were observed when selected recombinant proteins  were produced in larger culture volumes  with final yields in the range of 2– <dig> mg/l  <cit> .

we tested for several recombinant proteins whether their solubility reflects the folding to the native state. tev protease purified from the soluble fractions of cells with and without co-overproduction of els was active in cleaving a gst-tep <dig> domain fusion protein  and showed highly similar circular dichroism spectra . for the target protein e8r <dig> the soluble material purified from cells without chaperone co-overproduction showed co-purification of significant amounts of el, in contrast to the e8r <dig> protein purified from els/kje/clpb overproducing cells which appears el-free , indicative of correct folding. these results suggest that the overproduction of chaperones not only results in improved solubility of the recombinant proteins tested but also enhances the acquisition of the native state.

the increase in solubility of target proteins relative to control cells without co-overexpression of chaperones  is given in the column "yield increase". the chaperone combinations for optimal yield of each target protein in the one-step and two-step procedures are indicated. proteins that exhibited solubility exclusively after chaperone co-overexpression are indicated by "∞". the symbol "*" indicates that no soluble protein was purified from cells with or without chaperone co-overproduction. n.d., not determined. the same protein name can appear more than one time in the list because different constructs  have been used for its expression.

to further improve the solubility of recombinant proteins we considered that it may be of advantage to allow chaperone-assisted folding in the absence of ongoing protein biosynthesis, thereby preventing the continuous generation of novel aggregation-prone proteins. in one set of experiments we prevented further synthesis of the plasmid-encoded target and chaperone proteins by withdrawal of iptg. in another set of experiments synthesis of all cellular proteins was blocked by the addition of chloramphenicol  to the culture medium after removal of iptg.

in  <dig> out of  <dig> tested recombinant proteins the two-step procedure resulted in higher solubility yields as compared to the one-step procedure . out of these, two proteins required the two-step procedure for any solubilization, and six proteins showed a chaperone-mediated solubilization only with the two-step procedure. for  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins the chaperone combinations  <dig> or  <dig>  resulted in the highest yields of soluble recombinant protein . the two-step procedure thus is clearly superior over the one-step procedure in the production of soluble recombinant protein.

as an example fig. 4a shows the data obtained for btke, a domain of the brutons tyrosine kinase from human, applied to all  <dig> chaperone combinations . even in control cells lacking chaperone expression plasmids, the two-step procedure resulted in a slight  increase in btke solubility as compared to the one-step procedure. this is in agreement with the previous observation that in wild type cells, the recovery of soluble recombinant proteins from aggregates can be improved by inhibition of protein biosynthesis  <cit> . the total amount of btke produced under chaperone-coexpressing conditions was similar for all  <dig> strains tested. the one-step procedure resulted in an increased solubility of btke only for chaperone combinations  <dig> and  <dig>  in contrast, the two-step procedure, with a two-hour folding period in the presence of chloramphenicol, resulted in increased solubility for all five chaperone combinations, as compared to the control without chaperone co-overproduction. the most striking case was chaperone combination  <dig>  in which the solubility of btke, as compared to the control cells without chaperone co-overproduction, was 42-fold higher for the two-step procedure; in contrast, the one-step procedure  yields only a 7-fold increase . interestingly, the optimal chaperone combination differs between the one-step procedure  and the two-step procedure  . this switch in chaperone utilization probably reflects the fact that during the folding period in step  <dig>  aggregated btke is solubilized in a process that requires the concerted action of kje and clpb.

several parameters were found to affect the solubilization efficiency. a two hour incubation of the cells in chloramphenicol containing media at 20°c was optimal for high yields of soluble btke . longer incubation times or higher temperature lowered the yield, probably because btke is not entirely stable and is degraded in vivo as indicated by the decreased total amounts of btke found in these cells. furthermore, significant solubility of btke  could be achieved when transcription of the target gene was decreased by the removal of the inducer iptg during the folding period, instead of inhibiting protein biosynthesis by chloramphenicol .

although the chaperone combinations described so far showed remarkable effects on the solubility of  <dig> out of  <dig> recombinant proteins we aimed at a further optimization of the procedure. recent findings indicate that the activity of clpb in disaggregation and refolding of heat denatured proteins is facilitated by the presence of the bacterial shsps, ibpa and ibpb   <cit> . we tested the effects of co-expression of the ibpab genes  either alone , or with els  or els, kje, clpb  .

the co-overproduction of ibpab  resulted in significant further improvement of the solubility of recombinant proteins . remarkably, ibpab co-overproduction was beneficial even for some of the proteins, which remained completely insoluble with any of the previously tested  <dig> chaperone combinations. fig. 4a shows two examples  of such previously insoluble proteins. out of the  <dig> proteins tested, the co-overproduction of ibpab resulted in an increased solubility of  <dig> proteins in the one-step procedure . using the two-step procedure the yields of  <dig> additional soluble proteins was increased . in sum,  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins tested showed increased solubility, and in  <dig> cases the chaperone co-expression was the only possibility to obtain any soluble protein.

increases in the amount of purified, soluble protein are given relative to the optimal solubility  obtained either by the best of the combinations  <dig> to  <dig> tested before  or to control cells . symbols as in table  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
taking all results together, the co-overproduction of the entire network of major cytosolic chaperones in e. coli cells, combined with a two-step procedure that allows for folding of the recombinant proteins in the absence of ongoing de novo synthesis, resulted in an increased solubility of 70% of the  <dig> recombinant proteins tested. this efficiency is remarkable as most of the constructs used in this study encode proteins that are difficult to be produced in soluble form. the engineered e. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here  should prove particularly useful for biotechnological applications.
