BACKGROUND
transmembrane helix  proteins form 27% of the human proteome  <cit> . solute carriers  constitute the second largest family of tm proteins  <cit> . there are  <dig> slc classes, according to sequence similarity and functional properties, containing at least  <dig> human slcs  <cit> . three of the largest slc families, slc <dig>  slc <dig> and slc <dig>  comprising at least  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> human proteins, respectively, contain protein domains that are members of the drug/metabolite transporter  clan cl <dig> in pfam  <dig>   <cit> . a recent study presented evidence that the dmt-containing proteins are relatively dissimilar from other slcs, and were present before the divergence of bilateria  <cit> .

the dmt clan comprises transporter proteins that have a remarkably wide substrate range, from proteins that transport nucleotide-sugar conjugates in the golgi apparatus , to metal ion transporters  and bacterial proteins that transport toxins, such as camphor, chloroquine, or ethidium bromide  <cit> . interestingly, the slc <dig> proteins could constitute one of the evolutionary bottlenecks of the emergence of multicellularity that depends on proteoglycans, which are built from nucleotide sugar-conjugates and exported to the extracellular matrix. thus, evolutionary steps in cell surface molecule-dependent human biology may be reflected in dmt domain evolution  <cit> . for example, the notch receptor, involved in cell fate determination, as well as t-cell lineage development commitment, intercellular communication and neuronal development, requires fucosylation and gdp-fucose transport by slc35c <dig>  slc35c <dig> to function  <cit> . gene expression and copy number variation studies have identified slc35e <dig> as a tumor suppressor gene in neuroblastoma  <cit> , and slc35e <dig> as an overexpressed gene in glioblastoma  <cit> . slc35f <dig> and slc35f3- <dig> are uncharacterized but have been found to be expressed in brain, specifically in the cerebellum  <cit> .

the superfamily of dmts was defined and expanded using iterative homology search, using  <dig> pre-existing families, of which  <dig> are exclusively prokaryotic by jack dl, yang nm, saier mh, jr.   <cit> . in the transporter classification database, there are  <dig> dmt families  <cit> , using nomenclature adapted from the enzyme commission. jack dl, yang nm, saier mh, jr.  presented a theory from their observations of tm structures in microorganism and bacteria-based phylogenies, that the dmts have undergone duplications such that  <dig> tm proteins  gained an extra helix, and then duplicated to a  <dig> tm state, or possibly duplicated first and then gained 1- <dig> extra helices  <cit> . subsequently, pfam, the most widely used domain database, introduced its dmt clan , by applying a standard clan definition scheme on the iterative homology data set of jack dl, yang nm, saier mh, jr. . in its present form, cl <dig> has  <dig> member families, including the large and diverse eama family, which is named after the o-acetylserine/cysteine export gene in e. coli and was previously known as "duf6"  <cit> . the pfam dmt clan encompasses data from more species than jack dl, yang nm, saier mh, jr. , but does not explicitly recognize that dmt-encoding genes have either single or double copies of dmt domains. this means that pfam has been instrumental in defining the dmt superfamily through an automated scheme that does not incorporate the current evolutionary model of dmt proteins. the consequence is that the inclusion criteria is based on full-length sequence data, and may cluster sequences incorrectly.

alphabetical nomenclature of slc classes was introduced by hugo/hgnc  <cit> . the work was, analogously to pfam, performed independently of the original dmt phylogeny, and has been elaborated since  <dig> in databases such as slc tables . the slc classification system has been shaped on the level of complete proteins -not domains- and is not specifically based on work that incorporates the two domain conjecture. in this paper, we delineate the evolution of these protein domain families considering the two parallel classification systems, one used for bacteria , and one for animals/h. sapiens . until now, no comprehensive study has been published on dmt that is based on the two domain conjecture and uses all the  <dig> dmt families in pfam, in animals, plants and bacteria. to focus our study, we will primarily investigate the evolutionary origin of nucleotide sugar transporters  in the context of the dmt evolution. the term nucleotide sugar transporter is taken here to apply to all transporters of nucelotide sugars, not only the pfam dmt family explicitly called "nst", but also other dmt families that transport such substances. the main difference between the dmt and slc terms is that dmt is a type of domain, referring to the original study of jack dl, yang nm, saier mh, jr. , and the machine annotated pfam superfamily, whereas slc is a large family of full-length proteins, which contains some subfamilies that contain dmt domains.

there are at least four reports that strengthen the theory that single domain proteins gain a helix and duplicate to a ~ <dig> tm configuration. firstly, it has been shown that if dmts exist in a single domain form, their lysine and arginine residues  are carefully balanced in the membrane to enable 'dual topology' insertion  <cit> . 'dual topology' means that a single domain dmt protein can insert into the membrane facing either direction, and implies that transport activity would necessitate interaction between two oppositely oriented dmt single domain units. secondly, if dmt proteins exist in paired form in the same gene, the halves have permanent and opposite orientations, having their positive residues on the cytoplasmic side. the insertion direction of the emre gene product  can be controlled in a model system, to show that interaction between two oppositely oriented single dmt domains is responsible for protein activity  <cit> . thirdly, in confirmation there are genomically paired but un-fused single domain genes in the duf <dig> family that are already locked in their lysine and arginine bias. nine independent duplication events in duf <dig>  can be demonstrated with evidence of evolution from  <dig> tm units to paired or fused genes that give fixed and opposite membrane orientation of the two dmt domains and resulting protein activity  <cit> . finally, a consensus of the emre structure was established from a  <dig> +  <dig> tm asymmetric structure, by cryoelectron microscopy and a revised x-ray structure, which differ by only  <dig>  Ångström in root mean square deviation, confirming the asymmetric paired structure  <cit> .

the current study defines the first and second domains in relation to the tm segments in the ten dmt families containing human proteins, henceforth referred to as the "human dmt families" in this paper. maximum likelihood  phylogenetic trees are made for the first domains, to find models of dmt subfamily evolution. the phylogenetic trees are resolved, and the oldest model organism sequence in each branch is used to estimate the age of the subfamily. to identify the origin of human  <dig> +  <dig> tm architecture dmts, hidden markov model  comparison was applied on first and second domains. the use of both maximum likelihood bootstrap forests and hidden markov models is particularly applicable to dmts, as they constitute a large and diverse pfam clan. here we give a detailed definition and description of the human dmt/slc <dig> family and present an intriguing evolutionary history which supports an ancient internal duplication in eama.

RESULTS
dmt families are present in diverse kingdoms and phyla
to ascertain the distribution of dmt families  in a diverse set of kingdoms and phyla and to obtain a representative set of protein sequences for further analysis, we selected a dozen model organisms -  <dig> animals,  <dig> fungus,  <dig> amoebozoa, and  <dig> plant  - and then searched the proteomes of each for matches to the ten human dmt families . this was done using standard pfam tools . within the organisms selected, the representation of families ranges from high  to low . all sequences are listed in .

table lists number of full-length sequences obtained from the mining of the model organism proteomes listed in , containing pfam-a hmm hits to dmts listed in . the parenthesized numbers show the change of sequence counts after alignment editing. the species abbreviations are as follows: h. sapiens , m. musculus , g. gallus , t. rubripes , c. intestinalis , d. melanogaster , c. elegans , n. vectensis , t. adhaerens , s. cerevisiae , d. discoideum , a. thaliana .

for each dmt family, the members found in the  <dig> selected organisms were aligned at the protein level using mafft-einsi  <cit> . manual editing was then performed to realign/remove poorly aligned sequences using maxalign   <cit> , with the additional goals of retaining all human protein sequences and retaining regions with conserved transmembrane characteristics . the alignments can be found in the additional material .

domain architecture of human dmt families
the conception of a "domain" as a stably folding protein segment is not technically applicable to membrane-inserted proteins, and we will in this paper use "domain" to describe a part of a membrane inserted protein that has an independent evolutionary history  <cit> .

seven of the human dmt families were cut into n-terminal and c-terminal domains by symmetry. cutting by symmetry means that we divide a  <dig> tm family as  <dig> +  <dig> tm structure, or that it is a single domain family that will not be subject to cutting. when we refer to 'single domain' dmt families, this can either mean that the domain tends to exist in single copy inserted in a longer sequence  or that the whole sequence is only that domain .

the three remaining  human families that could not have domains defined in this straightforward way are: duf <dig>  cation efflux, and zip. in the case of zip, there is considerable length of aligning sequence after the last tm block that is part of pfam's zip domain.

canonical example sequences of these anomalous  families were analyzed with dlp-svm  and tmhmm , suggesting a  <dig> +  <dig>   <dig> +  <dig>  and  <dig> +  <dig> tm architecture in relation to the dmt domain border, respectively. finally, placement of the domain boundary in the zip and cation efflux families was determined by the concurrent location of pfam low complexity regions as well as a large gapped region in the alignment, and in the case of duf <dig> by use of a generic hmm recognizing the dmt- <dig> and dmt- <dig> domains. tables s <dig>  and  <dig> list different evidence type used to locate domain border and the final conclusion for each family.

resolved dendrograms of dmts identify stable subfamilies in eama, cation efflux, and zip
using the knowledge of the domain architecture, we then extracted just the first domain  from the overall alignments obtained previously. we made  <dig> dmt dendrograms, such as the one shown in figure  <dig>  using the dmt- <dig> domains with raxml  <cit> . we resolved the trees , i.e. ensured that they do not contain any nodes with bootstrap support <50%, using tools to edit the bootstrap forests . the number of sequences in the resolved tree is smaller than the original number of sequences because of the editing process .

the organisms found in the branches can in theory be treated as markers of the age of the branch system, but due to the possibility of excessive sequence deletion or polychotomous tree formation, these trees should be viewed as hypothesis generating material, rather than accurate date estimates.

only three of the dendrograms are found to contain stable independent branches that exist in at least  <dig> organisms: eama, zip , cation efflux . the eama, zip, and cation efflux dendrograms each contain four distinct branches . in the other seven families the low number of sequences in the analysis limits the number of identifiable branches.

in cation efflux and zip, the slc39a <dig> and the so called 'chicken-specific branch' were formed in or before t. adhaerens. this could be related to the ion transport needs of the proto-synaptic system of t. adhaerens, and the subsequent emergence of a primitive nervous system in n. vectensis .

visualization of the similarity relationships between nucleotide sugar transporter domains reveals the key role of the eama family
before further detailed analysis of the individual family dendrograms, we sought to identify which dmt family was the most likely origin of the nucleotide sugar transporters. the aim was to find which of the dmt families having a nucleotide sugar transporter function displayed most similarity to the other nucleotide sugar transporters with respect to its dmt- <dig> and dmt- <dig> domains.

to obtain a quantitative measure of similarity, we trained hmms on each domain halve of the nucleotide sugar transporter families , and then found the similarity between every pairwise combination of domain hmms using the hhsearch program. the hhsearch probability  <cit>  values indicate the probability that the two hmms are significantly related. two complementary methods were then employed to visualize the relationships embedded within that matrix.

non-metric multidimensional scaling  <cit>  was used  to construct a two-dimensional representation of the similarity data  in which the domains are positioned so that the distances between them reflects as much as possible the original dissimilarity values. the resulting configuration shows a striking bipartitioning of the domains that recapitulates whether they are first or second domains. furthermore, the domains nearest the notional "boundary" between the two clusters are eama- <dig>  and eama- <dig> . our interpretation of this is that it suggests that eama was the original family from which the other four nucleotide sugar transporter families evolved.

the second method was to select the most highly similar pairs of domains, connect them by "edges" in a graph, and seek a visual representation of that graph. we used  <dig> % hhsearch similarity as a threshold to define edges, because empirically  <dig> % is the lowest threshold we could set and still obtain a connected graph between all ten nucleotide sugar transporter domain halves. a 99%-cutoff translates to a p-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  in the hhsearch conversion.

the result  was a planar graph , where v is the number of vertices, e the number of edges and f the number of faces. it can be seen from figure  <dig> that the eama  family nodes have the highest degree: d =  <dig>  d =  <dig>  d =  <dig>  and d =  <dig>  these results suggests that the nucleotide sugar transporters may have differentiated from eama.

in addition, if we plot the closest dmt- <dig> neighbors of the dmt1s and vice versa, we note that this also results in a graph  with highest degree assigned to eama/tpt. the closest dmt- <dig> neighbor of nst- <dig> is tpt- <dig> , and the closest dmt- <dig> neighbor of duf914-1/uaa- <dig> is eama- <dig> . the closest dmt- <dig> neighbor of nst-2/uaa-2/duf914- <dig> is eama- <dig> . our interpretation of these results is that the nucleotide sugar transporters have differentiated from eama.

comparing inter-domain and eama distances of human 5+ <dig> tm structure dmts reveals likely ancestral position of eama
we produced a "divergence process table" , using the values from hhsearch for the first and second domains of duf <dig>  eama, nst, tpt, uaa families. the table shows the increasing distance from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, measured in units of 100-hhsearch probability, between the first and second domains, as well as the increasing distance to eama from zero to  <dig> %, measured in units of 100-hhsearch probability. note that the ordering of the interdomain distances exactly replicates the ordering of the distance from eama, and that the nst interdomain halve similarity is surprisingly low .

divergence process table showing increasing distance between dmt- <dig> and dmt- <dig>  and increasing distance to eama. the measurements are indicated in hhsearch probability and presented as  to convert similarity to distance. the domain halve distance is reported using dmt- <dig> as hmm query and dmt- <dig> as 'database'. the standard deviation is shown because each measurement in the eama distance column represents the average of .

thus the data is consistent with a scenario in which the nucleotide sugar transporters were formed from a duplication event in eama. next we examine the hmms for the human 5+ <dig> tm nucleotide sugar transporters and find recurrent motifs, before returning to the resolved dendrogram for eama to study its component sequences.

using the consensus sequences of hmms for human eama-derived 5+ <dig> tm dmts to study sequence evolution identifies g-x-g motif
pairwise comparisons are made for hmm consensus sequences of dmt families that are presumed, from results, to have evolved from each other . the aligning residues in the consensus sequences are obtained from hhsearch. aligning hhsearch consensus residues  are counted if they are located in tm segments. in the first tm segment of the second domain, a motif g-x-a is found, and in the 5th tm segment of the second domain, g-x-g is discovered. some of the tpt- <dig> sequences are eama sequences, because tpt is not found in the dmt- <dig> slot; we assume that duf914- <dig> evolved from eama- <dig> directly.

oldest model organism sequence in subfamilies in the edited eama bootstrap forests reveals origin in animalia of amac and slc35c/e subfamilies
both versions of the eama tree contain the amac and slc35c/e clusters, suggesting that the removal of sequences does not affect the main subfamilies of eama. we selected eama for exact dating of independent branches because it is established in results that it is one of three human dmt families that display distinct branches, and in results that eama is the origin of human  <dig> +  <dig> tm structure dmts. the following eama subfamilies were found: amacs, slc35fs, slc35c/es and pups. the subfamilies are named from their human sequence constituents.

the oldest model organism represented in the amac and slc35c/e branches are respectively: d. discoideum  and t. adhaerens . because excessive editing of the bootstrap forests could result in erroneous deletion of ancient organism sequences, the steps  <dig> - <dig>  are undertaken to confirm these results. the oldest model organism sequence of the slc35fs is an a. thaliana sequence , thus making it impossible to date the slc35f subfamily using this model organism selection.

we used third party annotation  in dna databank of japan, ddbj, to supplement annotation to the oldest model organism sequence in the independent branches of the resolved bootstrap forest of eama: d. discoideum tmem <dig>  was super-annotated as , and t. adhaerens slc35e <dig>  was super-annotated as .

tblastn analysis confirms age of subfamilies in the resolved eama dendrogram
we extend the analysis to a new set of  <dig> species , because a dozen species obviously represents a rather limited sampling of species, making our ability to resolve the time of emergence of any subfamily limited. we compared timetree divergence time data  for the new set of  <dig> species to the timetree divergence time data from the old set of  <dig> species   <cit> .

a tblastn  <dig> .24+ querying of the human counterparts  of the oldest model organism sequences against the "nr" database  show that d. discoideum tmem <dig> and t. adhaerens slc35e <dig> sequences are indeed the oldest constituents in their respective subfamilies , because there is a sharp drop  in sequence quality of hits in model organisms with a higher divergence time to h. sapiens than the oldest model organism sequences.

slc35c <dig>  tmem <dig> are absent in viridiplantae
we took the other human constituents of the branches, i.e. slc35c <dig>  tmem <dig> and queried them against "nr" plants ; the quality of the hits is 45- <dig> , with a coverage of 40-67% for the respective best hit, for h. sapiens slc35c <dig>  and h. sapiens tmem <dig> . amac is not represented in plants at all. these hits are not of comparable quality to those obtained between the human sequence and the oldest model organism sequences identified above, where we had scores above  <dig> and cover the full-length sequences. thus, it appears that our oldest model organism sequence from the branches found in eama in the hypothesis generating section of the study agrees with the result from blast-based method.

molecular clock analysis of eukaryotic eama branches estimates slc35e <dig> and tmem <dig> emergence to  <dig> and  <dig> mya
we determined molecular clock distances between the oldest model organism sequence in the amac and slc35c/e subfamilies of eama and the respective orthologue sequences in human. the simpler  tree is rejected on a significance level of 5%. the following distances were obtained: tmem <dig> , slc35e <dig> , and slc35f <dig> . these distances theoretically correspond to the divergence time estimate of h. sapiens-d. discoideum , h. sapiens-a. thaliana , and h. sapiens-t. adhaerens , using timetree divergence time estimates. thus, using the slc35f <dig> distance as a reference, the mya estimates for the other sequence pairs are: tmem <dig>  and slc35e <dig> . the divergence time of these sequences is congruent with an emergence of the amac and slc35c/e subfamilies in animalia, rather than in viridiplantae.

distribution in plants and bacteria provides strong evidence for eama's ancestral position in nucleotide sugar transporter evolution
to gain a wider perspective on the evolution of the entire dmt clan, we also investigated the representation of all of the  <dig> dmt families listed in pfam . using a separate extraction of 10+ <dig> dmt families  in plants and bacteria, we compare the distribution of the number of sequences found .

table lists number of full-length sequences found in pfam full sequence data, using the organisms in : zma = zea mays; osa = oryza sativa ; vvi = vitis vinifera; ptr = populus trichocarpa; psi = picea sitchensis; ppa = physcomitrella patens; olu = ostreococcus lucimarinus; ota = ostreococcus tauri. the dmt families are represented by letters: eama ; tpt ; duf <dig> ; uaa ; nst ; duf <dig> ; duf <dig> ; upf <dig> ; zip ; cation ; crcb ; crt-like ; duf <dig> ; duf <dig> ; fae ; mdr ; rhat ; sugt ; upf <dig> .

the distribution of sequences between dmt families in plants and bacteria differs dramatically . in plants, the human dmt families we have discussed earlier are present in large numbers, using the sequence retrieval procedure presented in the methods section: tpt , duf <dig> , uaa , nst , duf <dig> . in bacteria we obtain the following counts for the same families: tpt , duf <dig> , uaa , nst , duf <dig> . the dmt families not represented in human, presented in table s <dig> , display the opposite distribution pattern, having large numbers in the bacteria and small numbers in plants. for details about the sequences used to analyze dmt families not represented in human, see table s <dig>  and the additional alignments .

the number of eama sequences differs between the different plant species: poplar, maize, rice, and grape have more than  <dig> eama proteins per species. moss, algae and spruce have 20- <dig> copies per species. peas, beans, and grass have less than  <dig> eama proteins per species. purple false brome, which is a monocot, has zero copies of eama, using the sequence retrieval in methods. the observation that eama is the only 5+ <dig> tm nucleotide sugar transporter that is present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes provides convincing evidence  that eama is the origin of the nucleotide sugar transporters found in h. sapiens.

mdr  is identified as the likeliest single domain progenitor to eama
in the eama mafft-einsi alignment ,  <dig> % of the sequences have eama in the first domain position. in addition,  <dig> % of the sequences have eama in the second domain position. the most prevalent non-eama domain in the second position in the eama alignment is tpt . this shows that eama can exist in single copy form.

it also illustrates the high tendency for tpt to exist in heterogeneous constellation with other dmt domains. in the tpt alignment, all  <dig> sequences except one have tpt in the second dmt position. of the sequences containing a tpt copy ,  <dig> are paired with an eama domain in the first slot, and  <dig> sequences are paired with one each of uaa, nst or crt-like. one sequence has a long c-terminal tail containing multiple non-dmt domains, and  <dig> sequences have no pfam domain definition for the first "dmt slot", even though that area contains the same dmt-like tm helices as other annotated sequences.

two hmms were trained: one called 'eama-1' trained on the first domain position in the eama alignment , and the second hmm on the first domain position in cases where the second position is not filled by eama. the specialized single copy eama hmm  was taken to represent a more ancestral "unpaired" form of eama.

subsequently, 'eama-1' and ' <dig> × eama' were queried against all single domain families having  <dig> or  <dig> tms. both of these eama hmms scored highest against mdr . this result may indicate a close evolutionary relationship between eama and the single domain family mdr . mdr has a g-x-g motif in its fourth trans-membrane region, with prevalence in the g positions of 47-88%, indicating that the 4th tm in mdr may correspond to the 5th tm in eama.

table shows result of pairwise hhsearch comparison of eama- <dig>  using all sequences in the alignment, or  <dig> × eama, i.e. cases where eama is present in first domain slot without eama in second domain slot. the eama hmm is used as query, and the other families as 'database'.

further identification of recurrence of g-x-g motif in paired dmt domains, excluding eama-derived cases and cation efflux , confirms the importance of the motif
to buttress previously presented results concerning g-x-g , we identified g-x-g in the remaining two domain dmts. a measurement of >65% glycine frequency in tm-internal positions are recorded  . three observations of g-x-g are found in the 5th tm helix of either dmt- <dig> or dmt- <dig> of duf <dig>  duf <dig>  zip, crt-like, sugt, rhat, and fae 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase  <dig> family. six additional observations of g-x-g are found in the remaining tm segments of dmt- <dig> of duf <dig>  duf <dig>  zip, crt-like, sugt, rhat, and fae 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase  <dig> family.

the total frequency of g-x-g  in tm segments is almost twice as high as expected  from a simulation of random sequence, assuming a tm length of ~ <dig> residues and a glycine frequency of 7% matching that found in our consensus sequences . furthermore, if we consider only the 5th tm segment, where we expect to see ~ <dig>  g-x-g, we have a 6-fold increase . cation efflux  does not contain any intra-helical glycine residues that are represented at a conservation level >65%, implying that this family differs in this structurally important aspect.

creation of "breadth-first" clustering of first domains of  <dig> dmts reveals three major groups: the eama, duf <dig> and metal transporter clusters
three clusters are discovered in a "breadth-first" clustering made using hhsearch probability to closest neighbor for the dmt- <dig> domain. these clusters are named eama, duf <dig>  and metal transporters , from their human or most notable member family. the clustering principle is to join any nearest neighbor, making the clustering independent of any cutoff.

three clusters are defined: eama , duf <dig> , and metal transporters .

the connections between duf606/duf <dig> and fae/sugt/rhat are in the 70-80% hhsearch probability range, and duf1632- <dig> displays  <dig> % hhsearch probability to be related with tpt- <dig>  duf1632- <dig> displays  <dig> % hhsearch probability to be related with eama- <dig>  the metal transporters display good similarity between dmt- <dig> and dmt- <dig> within the same faimily . the similarity between cation/zip and other dmt families falls below 1% hhsearch probability . crcb is only very weakly similar to duf <dig> .

all symmetrical two domain dmts in the eama cluster have cytosolic n- and c-termini, whereas all symmetrical two domain dmts in the duf <dig> cluster have golgi/endocytoplasmic reticulum/extracellular space-oriented  n- and c-termini, thus providing structural evidence corroborating the quality of the clustering. the membrane insertion is determined using phobius prediction, but also agrees with the positive  inside rule. for example, in the duf <dig> alignment,  <dig> out of  <dig> k, r positions are placed between inbound and outbound  phobius-predicted tm helices. large tm variation could be observed in duf <dig>  <cit> .

the membrane orientation illustrated using tmrpres2d  <cit>  in figure  <dig> shows, using example structures listed in the corresponding figure legend, the membrane orientation >50%. the lowest score for a two-domain case is zip , suggesting that this family differs substantially in this respect, and is unusually prone to variability in membrane insertion for a double domain dmt.

examination of fae 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase  <dig>  shows that it is unlikely to be correctly annotated as homologous to enzymes
fae 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase  <dig> is a member of the newly found duf <dig> cluster . the annotation on the pf <dig> is: "this family contains fatty acid elongase 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase  <dig>  a plant enzyme approximately  <dig> residues long." in the five seed sequences of pf <dig>  however, all sequences are found to have the 5+ <dig> tm structure typical of dmt solute carriers, raising doubts if the enzyme annotation in pfam is correct. a search of "pf07168" in uniprot returns six sequences that have status "reviewed", which are annotated as "ureide permease 1-5", and "ureide permease a3", thus raising further doubts if the enzyme annotation in pfam is correct.

to compare the alleged fae 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase  <dig> sequences with expert annotated faes, the b. napus ketoacyl-coa synthase  sequence  and l. annua kcs sequence  were obtained  <cit> . these proteins are only attached to the membrane by  <dig> tms in the n-terminal fifth of the sequence, thus presenting a completely different tm architecture.

a protein sequence search on the ncbi website, limiting the search field to "title" and "fatty acid elongase 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase 1", returned  <dig> hits. the tm structure of these sequences in six cases was the kcs-like structure with n-terminal transmembrane attachment through  <dig> tms. in the remaining cases, transmembrane helices could not be reliably predicted, and in one case , there was a conflicting "ureide permease" annotation. in the next release of pfam , the above results will form the basis of re-annotation of pf <dig> from fatty acid elongase 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase  <dig>  to ureide permease .

a possible background to the anomalous annotation may be the fact that e.g. slc35f <dig> in m. musculus and b. taurus have an extended gap between the first  <dig> tm segments and the remaining  <dig> tm segments, meaning that with incomplete sequence data, the overall n-terminal tm structure of slc35f <dig> resembles the overall n-terminal tm structure of many plant fatty acid elongases.

discussion
in this paper we present a comprehensive hierarchical order for the different clusters of human dmt containing proteins that is based on the suggestion that dmts consist of either one or two dmt domains. it has been our ambition to identify the independent branches of dmt families and trace how they have evolved in key model organisms, and to compare the relationship between dmt families to understand how they have been formed by domain duplications, presumably meiotic unequal crossing over. to this end, a bioinformatics strategy that combines the strengths of hidden markov models and resolved maximum likelihood dendrograms was found to be the most successful approach to gain these results.

eama is the likeliest progenitor of human 5+ <dig> tm structure nucleotide sugar transporters
here we propose that the dmt families were formed from eama, most likely through a domain duplication event before the radiation of viridiplantae. the evidence supporting this statement is that the sequence dissimilarity between domain  <dig> and  <dig> in the 5+ <dig> tm structure nucleotide sugar transporters successively increases from  <dig>  to  <dig> % hhsearch probability  between the two domain in each of: eama, tpt, duf <dig>  uaa, and nst . furthermore, the average sequence dissimilarity between each human 5+ <dig> tm structure dmt family and eama increase from  <dig>  to  <dig> % hhsearch probability, in the exact same order: tpt or duf <dig>  uaa, and nst.

the eama-derived 5+ <dig> tm structure families that are represented in h. sapiens, change their sequence number distribution pattern in pfam greatly between bacteria and plants . in bacteria, the eama-derived families are present in very small numbers: tpt , duf <dig> , uaa , nst . this can be compared to eama, which has  <dig>  sequences in the bacterial phylum listed in , providing further -and probably stronger- evidence that eama was the bacterial ancestor of tpt, duf <dig>  uaa, and nst.

it can be noted in uniprot that there is some limited evidence pointing to a trend of increased specialization in known substrate repertoire for human, eama-derived nucleotide sugar transporters, corresponding to the suggested evolutionary distance from eama . for instance, slc35a1-a <dig>  have one documented substrate each, whereas slc35b2- <dig>  both share the same substrate, and slc35d <dig> and d <dig>  have multiple substrates per transporter .

thus, the eama-derived families encompass all human slc <dig> sequences: slc35a1- <dig> , slc35b1- <dig> , slc35f1- <dig> , slc35c1- <dig> , slc35d1- <dig> , slc35e1- <dig> , slc35f3- <dig> .

the dmt- <dig> dendrograms of eama indicate that two independent branches containing cancer-related genes formed in animalia
we found that "amac" and slc35c/e form two independent subfamilies, exhibiting bootstrap support >50% within the eama tree . moreover, the oldest model organism sequences within each subfamily indicate that the amac subfamily  was formed in the lineage of d. discoideum , and that the slc35c/e subfamily was formed in the lineage of t. adhaerens . the human orthologues of these sequences are tmem <dig> and slc35e <dig> respectively.

by using h. sapiens tmem <dig> and slc35e <dig> as tblastn  <dig> .24+ queries against a set of eukaryotic model organisms, it was confirmed that there is a sharp drop in sequence similarity after the presumed divergence time of the oldest model organism sequences , well after the radiation of viridiplantae.

as further evidence supporting that "amac" and slc35c/e were formed in animalia, a treepuzzle molecular clock experiment shows that the estimated divergence time between tmem <dig> in h. sapiens and d. discoideum is  <dig> mya. the mya estimate between slc35e <dig> in h. sapiens and t. adhaerens is  <dig> mya. these results use the treepuzzle divergence time estimate between h. sapiens and a. thaliana slc35f <dig> as reference measurement, assuming that they diverged  <dig> mya.

these results indicate that the slc35c/e lineage, which contains slc35c1- <dig> transporters necessary for fucosylation of the notch receptor  <cit> , and the slc35e1- <dig> transporters known to function as oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes in e.g. neuroblastoma  <cit>  and glioblastoma  <cit> , was probably formed in animalia. tmem <dig>  from the "amac" subfamily, is also involved in cancer  <cit> .

the amac  subfamily was formed in multicellular organisms, with a smaller divergence time from human than viridiplantae. it is suspected "amac" is an incorrect enzyme annotation on a 5+ <dig> tm structure dmt transporter  <cit> , because of its high similarity to solute carriers, especially eama domain containing proteins such as tmem <dig>  it should be noted however, that amac has a g-x-g motif -g) in its final tm segment in dmt- <dig>  showing that if it is a dmt, it differs in this structural respect. amac is an interchangeable, but more general biochemical term than fae 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase  <dig>  which would refer only to synthase # <dig>  hgnc has informed that, based on this study, the amac <dig> and amac-like  sequences, will be re-named to slc35fs in refseq for human and mouse in the future.

a recurrent glycine motif, g-x-g, is over-represented in the 5th tm helix of the dmt- <dig> domain, and constitutes the most widely conserved motif between all dmt families
glycine, which is a helix breaker in globular proteins, is found in tm helices  <cit> . the g-x-g motif is found in both eama domains, the tpt- <dig> domain, the duf914- <dig> domain, and in uaa- <dig> in the hhsearch consensus sequences . for two domain dmts that are not eama-derived, nine tm-internal g-x-g are found that have a >=65% frequency, of which three are found in the 5th tm helix of dmt- <dig> . this motif may have the role of introducing flexibility, or permit ion passage in the helix, considering that a shift of seven residues would be the optimal distance to orient two residues one helix turn apart. it is stated on the dmt pfam entry  that many sequences contain a characteristic glycine-rich motif in the c-terminal sequence, but we have reported a more detailed characterization of this feature. apart from the g-x-g feature, and the two domain structure, it can be noted that dmts  tend to have short loops  between the tm segments, making the occurrence of any secondary structure in such linker peptides unlikely.

dmt families form three main clusters , of which the metal transporters  are the most divergent
three main clusters are defined by "breadth first" clustering of the first domain of  <dig> dmt families, connecting nearest neighbors . the duf <dig> and eama clusters are reinforced by conserved membrane insertion orientation in  <dig> out of  <dig> of the families in the eama cluster, and  <dig> out of  <dig> of the families in the duf <dig> cluster. furthermore, the eama cluster is reinforced by the fact that all nucleotide sugar transporters  are contained within the cluster. the strongest relations between the duf <dig> and eama clusters  is >100-fold stronger than the intercluster edge between the metal transporter cluster and any member of the eama cluster. the lower limit for sequence composition as measured by hhsearch "edges" between the families in the eama cluster is >55% hhsearch probability , compared to >1% in the metal transporter cluster. the paired, but asymmetric transmembrane structure of the metal transporters, and metal ion substrates, highlights the fact that the metal transporters differ substantially in these respects from the other dmts. the high similarity between dmt- <dig> and dmt- <dig> in the metal transporters highlights that they appear to have been formed by domain duplication.

fae 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase  <dig>  domain-containing proteins are homologous to transporters, not enzymes
the annotation of pf <dig> as fatty acid elongase 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase  <dig> appears incorrect because the proteins containing this dmt domain have the same  <dig> tm configuration and sequence similarity with other solute carriers in the dmt superfamily, and not the  <dig> tm configuration of well documented fatty acid elongases. the uniprot reviewed annotation for fae containing proteins is "ureide permease". in the next release of pfam , this result will form the basis of re-annotation of pf <dig> from fatty acid elongase 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase  <dig>  to ureide permease .

CONCLUSIONS
we have established that the slc <dig> nucleotide sugar transporters were formed from a duplication event in eama, probably before the radiation of viridiplantae. a cluster of dmts, called duf <dig>  have non-cytosolic n- and c-termini and appear to come from a different duplication event than the nucleotide sugar transporters. we have discovered two independent branches within eama that formed after the radiation of viridiplantae. these independent branches are called "amac" and "slc35c/e", from their human constituents. the amacs  are probably not enzymes, but solute carriers similar to nucleotide sugar transporters. a new motif has been characterized, g-x-g, strongly overrepresented in the 5th tm helix of dmt- <dig>
