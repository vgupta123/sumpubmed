BACKGROUND
changes in gene expression patterns, via changes in cis -regulatory elements, or in the trans -acting factors binding to these elements, has contributed to the development of novel morphological structures during evolution  <cit> . the high degree of conservation in the coding region of genes necessary to establish the animal body plan has been extensively documented. the growing wealth of metazoan genome sequence data has also provided evidence for the conservation of sequences outside the coding regions of genes, the conserved non-coding elements  that tend to be located close to developmental genes  <cit> . however, whether the conservation of cne sequence is necessary for any conservation of cne regulatory activity remains debateable. recent studies have identified regulatory sequences with very little sequence conservation that have the ability to activate transcription in highly similar tissues  <cit> . furthermore, highly conserved regulatory sequences can drive transcription in highly divergent patterns  <cit> . therefore, it remains challenging to predict regulatory activity based solely upon sequence similarity, or vice versa. currently, a great effort has been made in systematically characterizing the cnes in the mouse genome allowing for comparison with other model and non-model organisms  <cit> .

dlx homeobox genes of vertebrates are involved in the development of the forebrain, visceral arches, sensory organs, and limbs  <cit> . they are organized as three convergently transcribed bigene clusters, present in most jawed vertebrates: dlx1/dlx <dig> , dlx3/dlx <dig> and dlx5/dlx <dig>  <cit> . the three bigene clusters most likely originate from the duplications of an ancestral bigene cluster occurring as whole genome duplication events throughout vertebrate evolution  <cit> . a similar bigene arrangement of dlx genes has been reported in the ascidian ciona intestinalis  <cit> , suggesting that the ancestral bigene existed prior to vertebrate radiation. the bigene organization of dlx genes appears to be important for the concerted expression of the two genes within each cluster as cis -regulatory elements  have been identified in the relatively short  intergenic regions separating the two genes of each cluster  <cit> .

of the six dlx genes found in tetrapod vertebrates, the dlx1/dlx <dig> and dlx5/dlx <dig> clusters are involved in forebrain development. we have previously reported three cres from the intergenic regions of these two bigene clusters in mouse: i12b from the dlx1/dlx <dig> locus and i56i and i56ii from the dlx5/dlx <dig> locus  <cit> . however, cres regulating dlx expression can also be found outside the intergenic region and we reported one such cre named upstream regulatory element  <dig> , located approximately  <dig> kb upstream of the mouse dlx <dig> gene  <cit> . we have previously shown some degree of conservation in the function of some dlx cres between mouse and zebrafish but it is not clear when these cres and their associated regulatory mechanisms originated during vertebrate evolution  <cit> .

as a cartilaginous fish, the elephant shark  occupies an interesting phylogenetic position as the sister group to bony fishes and tetrapods. its relatively small genome of  <dig> mbp and the availability of a low coverage genome  make this species a useful cartilaginous fish model to examine conservation of cres  <cit> . large scale comparison of the conserved non-coding regions between the elephant shark and the human and/or zebrafish genomes has revealed that more cnes are shared between human and elephant shark than between human and zebrafish  <cit> . these data are consistent with the observation of greater conservation in gene synteny between human and elephant shark genomes than between human and zebrafish genomes  <cit> . this may seem counterintuitive given that mammals share a more recent common ancestor with teleost fishes than with cartilaginous fishes. however, this situation likely results from the 'fish-specific' whole genome duplication event that occurred before the teleost radiation and led to loss or modification of cnes and a high level of genome re-organization in this group  <cit> . detailed analysis of the conservation of cnes associated with the hox clusters in the elephant shark, human, and fugu yielded various hypotheses on the possible correlation between the level of sequence conservation of vertebrate cnes and their functional variation  <cit> .

here, we report the identification of an elephant shark sequence orthologous to the conserved regulatory element ure <dig> associated with dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> genes. sequence comparisons show a high level of conservation within gnathostomes, with higher similarity between elephant shark and mouse ure <dig> than between elephant shark and zebrafish ure <dig>  we show that the enhancer activity of the elephant shark ure <dig>  in transgenic mouse and zebrafish is highly similar to that of its orthologous mouse and zebrafish counterparts in transgenic assays. in addition, cmure <dig> shows more similarity in sequence and function to the orthologous mouse sequence than to the zebrafish sequence, in agreement with the hypothesis of additional genome and gene regulation remodelling due to the subsequent teleost specific genome duplication.

RESULTS
sequence and synteny conservation near the dlx1/dlx <dig> bigene cluster
the dlx genes of most tetrapod vertebrates described thus far are organized as three dlx bigene clusters. as a result of the whole genome duplication event occurring in ancestral teleost fish, several other dlx genes have been identified in zebrafish;  an additional dlx1a/dlx2a bigene cluster located on chromosome  <dig>  and  a dlx <dig> -related gene, dlx2b , located on chromosome  <dig>  which is not physically linked to a dlx <dig> -like gene  <cit> . conserved synteny between the dlx -containing regions of zebrafish chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> supports the hypothesis that dlx1a/dlx2a and dlx2b arose from the duplication of a large chromosomal region, followed by the loss of the dlx <dig> -like gene from the b cluster. furthermore, the synteny is also conserved with a region of mouse chromosome  <dig> that contains the nearby genes itga <dig> , metapl <dig> and hat <dig> . the presence of cres within these genomic regions may contribute to the conservation of these synteny blocks  <cit> . in the mouse, the mmure <dig> cre, previously reported to be involved in dlx1/dlx <dig> regulation and located  <dig> kb upstream of dlx <dig> , falls within the sixth intron of the metapl <dig> gene  <cit> . this conserved sequence is able to drive reporter expression in the mouse forebrain  <cit> 
. in zebrafish, drure <dig> is located in a similar position upstream of the dlx1a gene but the unique metapl <dig> ortholog is found in synteny with dlx2b on chromosome  <dig>  no ure2-like sequence can be identified on zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  which rules out the possibility of a ure <dig> enhancer--like sequence acting on the metapl <dig> gene and suggests that the remaining dlx2b gene is not under the regulation of a ure <dig> sequence, except if the sequence has been highly remodelled after the duplication while still retaining its function. this, as well as the loss of other regulatory elements associated with the dlx1a-dlx2a bigene cluster  <cit> , may account for the reduced domains of expression in comparison to dlx2a  <cit> .

to investigate the corresponding genomic region in a cartilaginous fish species, we searched the elephant shark genome for dlx - and ure2-like sequences. we found independent reads including putative cmdlx <dig>  cmdlx <dig>  cmmetapl <dig>  cmure <dig> as well as cmi12a, a second dlx1/dlx <dig> regulatory element. after screening a bac library for the putative cmdlx <dig> sequence, we isolated a bac clone from which we could also pcr-amplify cmdlx <dig>  the two putative enhancer sequences, cmure <dig> and cmi12a, and exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the cmmetapl <dig> gene .

we produced an alignment of the elephant shark, mouse, and zebrafish ure <dig> sequences , approximately half of which could be aligned with no ambiguity . the cmure <dig> sequence closely resembles its mouse and zebrafish counterparts  with 85% identity between mmure <dig> and cmure <dig>  75% identity between mmure <dig> and drure <dig>  and 73% identity between drure <dig> and cmure <dig>  we then aligned the orthologous ure <dig> sequences extracted from the ensembl genome browser  for three other tetrapod species  and three other teleost species  . again, the elephant shark ure <dig> sequence was significantly  more similar to tetrapod sequences  than to teleost sequences . when testing for relative substitution rates with the elephant shark as an outgroup, the null hypothesis of equivalent substitution rates could be confidently rejected  when comparing zebrafish and mouse ure <dig> sequences or medaka and xenopus ure <dig>  in both cases a higher substitution rates was obtained in teleosts compared to tetrapods. these results strongly suggest that the elephant shark sequence is more similar to tetrapod sequences than to teleost sequences, most probably due to higher mutation rates in the latter clade.

the elephant shark ure <dig> sequence acts as a forebrain regulatory element in transgenic zebrafish and mice
to determine if the cmure <dig> sequence can act as a regulatory element and to compare its activity with its zebrafish and mouse counterparts, we prepared a series of reporter constructs in which the ure <dig> sequences are placed upstream of a cassette containing a Î²-globin minimal promoter and either the gfp or lacz reporter gene. the resulting constructs were tested in both transgenic  zebrafish and mice.

in zebrafish, the tg-drure <dig> drove gfp expression in the telencephalon and diencephalon starting at approximately  <dig> hpf . this expression was observed in two independent lines of transgenic zebrafish and persisted until  <dig> hpf , a time where gfp expression was also noted weakly in the pharyngeal arches . similarly, the cmure <dig> sequence targeted gfp expression to the forebrain of zebrafish embryos and larvae from  <dig> hpf until at least  <dig> hpf , with pharyngeal arch expression of the reporter transgene observed at the later time points in two independent transgenic lines . overall, the examination of live embryos indicated that the spatial distribution of the gfp protein was generally similar for both constructs suggesting similar activities for the elephant shark and zebrafish sequences in the brain and visceral arches . one site of tg-cmure <dig> activity that is not observed with tg-drure <dig>  and is not consistent with endogenous dlx1a or dlx2a expression, is the somites at  <dig> dpf  continuing until at least  <dig> dpf .

summary of reporter gene expression patterns under regulation by the zebrafish, elephant shark or mouse ure <dig> sequences  in zebrafish embryos staged from  <dig> to  <dig> days post-fertilization  in case of stable transgenic lines,  <dig> to  <dig> dpf in case of primary transgenic expression  and in mouse embryos aged e <dig>  .

we then examined the activity of the ure <dig> elements in the forebrain in greater detail and compared this with the endogenous expression of the zebrafish dlx1a/2a genes. the endogenous dlx expression domains correspond to the subpallium of the telencephalon and to specific regions of the diencephalon    <cit> . comparative in situ hybridization analysis of the gfp transcripts identifies highly comparable expression with endogenous dlx2a  and gfp in tg-drure <dig> embryos . however differences in transgene expression could be pointed in the tg-cmure <dig> line with no apparent detection of gfp expression in the prethalamus, as well as very restricted expression in the hypothalamus . anti-gfp immunohistochemistry on sections of transgenic embryos confirmed that the prethalamus expression was completely absent from tg-cmure <dig> embryos, while expression in the pre-optic area is comparable between tg-cmure <dig> and tg-drure <dig> . more posterior in the hypothalamus, the transgene was expressed only in a restricted lateral domain in the tg-cmure <dig> transgenic line, while the gfp expression domain was larger in the tg-drure <dig> line . immuno-localization of the gfp in these two lines also allowed us to detect gfp in the muscles associated to the visceral arches, as well as muscles in the tail , consistent with the fluorescence patterns described in figure  <dig>  examination of primary transgenic zebrafish obtained with a similar construct containing the mouse mmure <dig> sequence indicates that it behaves similarly to its elephant shark and zebrafish counterparts with expression in the telencephalic and diencephalic domains . notably, the transgene could also be detected in visceral arches at  <dig> dpf, in a pattern similar to that observed for tg-drure <dig> and tg-cmure <dig> .

similar constructs using lacz as the reporter gene were tested in primary transgenic mouse embryos at e <dig> . the three ure <dig> enhancers had very similar activities in the forebrain . all three ure <dig> sequences targeted expression to the telencephalon and diencephalon . forebrain expression of the reporter constructs was observed in 4/ <dig> and 4/ <dig> primary transgenic embryos obtained with cmure2-lacz and drure2-lacz , respectively . outside the forebrain, the mouse and elephant shark ure <dig> sequences showed more similarities in their activities compared to zebrafish ure2: both cmure <dig> and mmure <dig> could target expression to the dorsal root ganglia in primary transgenic embryos  or in two independent transgenic lines . the drure2-lacz transgene was not expressed in the dorsal root ganglia . the mouse ure <dig> element was the only one able to target expression to the branchial arches and to the apical ectodermal ridge of limb buds.

discussion
locus and sequence conservation among jawed vertebrates
in this study we identify a conserved regulatory region associated with dlx genes in the elephant shark. conserved synteny could not be precisely determined because the elephant shark genome is not assembled. however, the sequence identified as cmure <dig> is located on the bac clone containing the elephant shark dlx <dig> , dlx <dig> and metapl <dig> genes, similar to what is observed in all other jawed vertebrates for which genomic data are available . the putative conservation of the bigene cluster organisation between bony vertebrates and cartilaginous fish is consistent with the hypothesis that an ancestral chordate bigene cluster has been duplicated twice before the radiation of jawed vertebrates  <cit> . the identification of a ure <dig> sequence in vicinity of the elephant shark dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> genes also indicates this locus was linked to these genes in the ancestor of all jawed vertebrates. a search for sequences orthologous to this ure <dig> enhancer in species outside of jawed vertebrates did not yield any significant hit with the blastn tool from the ncbi sequence browser  <cit>  or the blat tool in the ucsc genome browser  <cit>  on the lamprey , tunicate  or lancelet  genomes, even though dlx genes have been identified in these organisms and bigene dlx tandems are present in lamprey and tunicate  <cit> 
. the high level of ure <dig> sequence conservation observed in jawed vertebrates suggests that it has evolved under high evolutionary constraints and that its enhancer activity likely emerged in the jawed vertebrate ancestor, after divergence of the cyclostomes, i.e., more than  <dig> myrs ago. interestingly, this reflects the trend observed for a number of other vertebrate cnes  <cit> .

enhancer activity, conservation, and variation
the most prominent expression domain of a transgene under the regulation of mmure <dig> or drure <dig> has been shown to be the forebrain, more precisely in the ventral telencephalon and diencephalon, in agreement with the pattern of endogenous expression of dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> genes  <cit> . both zebrafish transgenic lines obtained with drure <dig> and cmure <dig> driving expression of gfp produced comparable expression patterns, suggesting the regulatory activity of these orthologous sequences in developing forebrain and visceral arches is likely to be conserved. this overall conservation of the enhancer activity, along with a high level of identity between the two sequences, implicates conservation of transcription binding sites allowing the cmure <dig> to retain activity in the developing zebrafish and mouse brain. the results obtained with the drure <dig> transgenic zebrafish lines show that the activity of this enhancer recapitulates part of the dlx1a/dlx2a endogenous expression pattern in the forebrain. similarly mmure <dig> transgenic mouse lines recapitulate endogenous dlx1/dlx <dig> expression in this domain  <cit> . thus, the conservation of ure <dig> regulatory sequences correlates with conservation of their activity.

however, differences could be identified in the diencephalic expression domains  between the two transgenic lines. these discrepancies suggest that while the overall activity is conserved, the ure <dig> enhancer also shows some degree of modularity across the vertebrate phylogeny. accordingly, the differences between cmure <dig> and drure <dig> sequences could account for the differential expression pattern in the prethalamus and hypothalamus between different vertebrate species, whereas these sequence differences do not modify the enhancer activity in the telencephalon. in turn, these results suggest that these two dlx gene expression domains , even though both regulated by a unique functional ure <dig> enhancer, are perhaps the result of two distinct genetic pathways.

the drure <dig> and cmure <dig> sequences also drive expression in the developing telencephalon and diencephalon of transgenic mice, a pattern comparable to the endogenous mmure <dig> enhancer. again, this highlights the conservation of the regulatory cascade leading to dlx gene expression in the developing forebrain of mice. in this species, the function of ure <dig> in the forebrain seems to be completely conserved despite variation in the sequences, which highly contrasts with our results from transgenic assays in zebrafish where expression in the diencephalon seems to be sensitive to sequence variations. our results suggest that a distinct genetic pathway is specifically involved in teleost diencephalon development that would not be shared with mouse. this new pathway could have emerged after the additional genome duplication event occurring before teleosts radiation, which seeded many paralogous developmental genes that have the potential to be co-opted  as new independent upstream signals interacting with the zebrafish ure <dig> enhancer. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that subtle changes in zebrafish transcription factor binding specificity may account for the apparent divergence of the cmure <dig> enhancer function in the zebrafish forebrain, compared to the mouse forebrain.

the ure <dig> sequences studied here are also able to drive expression in the developing branchial arches. more specifically, the mmure <dig> can drive expression in the hyoid arch mesenchyme in transgenic mice, while drure <dig> and cmure <dig> did not produce any branchial signal in our primary transgenic embryos. drure <dig> and cmure <dig>  and possibly mmure <dig>  were able to drive gfp expression in muscles of the growing mandible and of the posterior-most visceral arches in transgenic zebrafish. the gfp fluorescence pattern obtained in zebrafish visceral arches  had expression in these structures, suggesting that mmure <dig> and cmure <dig> share some enhancer activity that has been lost by drure <dig> consistent with absence of dlx1a/dlx2a expression in dorsal root ganglia.

ure <dig> evolution in vertebrates
as no expression data is available from the elephant shark, we cannot correlate the cmure <dig> enhancer activity to the endogenous dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> expression patterns. it is therefore difficult to propose an overview of the evolution of the ure <dig> enhancer in vertebrates. however, our results show that the genomic organisation of the dlx1/dlx <dig> bigene cluster with a ure <dig> sequence in the vicinity is conserved amongst all jawed vertebrates. the three ure <dig> sequences coming either from a cartilaginous fish , a teleost fish , or a tetrapod  are able to drive expression in the forebrain with apparent complete robustness. these results highlight the strong selective constraint that may have acted against the modification of the regulatory sequences and the trans -activating protein domains, which interact with these enhancers, during jawed vertebrate evolution. however our results also show that ure <dig> enhancer activity in visceral arches and diencephalon is only partially conserved and has accumulated evolutionary modifications leading to variations from one organism to another. in particular, the lack of regulatory activity of cmure <dig> and drure <dig> in the visceral arches of the mouse could be the result of lineage-specific sequence modification in transcription factor binding sites during tetrapod evolution, possibly leading to modifications of the regulatory cascade involving the ure2-dlx <dig> -dlx <dig> module in the branchial arches.

CONCLUSIONS
as a chondrychtyan, the elephant shark provides a useful model to carry out comparative studies with jawed vertebrates to evaluate the relative contributions of changes in coding sequences and in cres, these changes may have lead to morphological innovations, such as the tripartite brain and branchial arches of jawed vertebrates. the use of the elephant shark had been limited to comparative dna sequence analysis  <cit> . here, we have shown that cres from the elephant shark can be successfully tested in teleost and tetrapod experimental models. whereas transgenes with elephant shark cres cannot yet be tested endogenously, as transgenesis in this species has yet to be developed, it may be possible to obtain gene expression data in elephant shark for comparative purposes. such expression studies would further increase the usefulness of the elephant shark in evolutionary developmental biology as an outgroup of bony vertebrates  showing not only a conserved genome structure but also, as highlighted here, conserved gene regulatory mechanisms.
