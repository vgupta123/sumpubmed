BACKGROUND
rna-protein interactions are involved in many biological processes, such as gene regulation and splicing  <cit> . discovering the rna-protein interactions has a great potential for further understanding the mechanisms behind those biological processes. for example, argonaute  protein belongs to components of the rna-induced silencing complex , which transfers micrornas  to be bound with 3’utr of their target genes, thereby result in mrna degradation or translation repression  <cit> . sequence-specific associations between rbps and their rna targets are mediated by binding domains, which recognize binding sites on rnas. where the rna-protein binding sites on the rnas are usually short sequences with  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides long, typically referred as binding motifs. detecting them can facilitate the deeper insights into post-transcriptional regulation.

although there are many genome-wide rna-binding protein detection techniques, such as rnacompete  <cit> , par-clip  <cit> , they are still cost-heavy and time-intensive. fortunately, with the advent of these high-throughput techniques, many useful genome-wide data associated with rbps are generated rapidly, including specific binding positions on rnas with proteins. these data provides important bases for developing computational approaches to predict the rbp binding sites by using the advanced computational methods .

at the very beginning of the methodology development of this field, predictors are mainly constructed by only using the sequence information. for instance, matrixreduce simply fits a statistical mechanical model to infer the sequence-specific binding sites for transcription factors from sequences  <cit> . drimust discovers motifs by integrating the minimum hyper-geometric statistical framework with suffix trees for fast enumerating motifs  <cit> .

besides the high-throughput sequences, actually multiple sources of data are available from the genome-wide rna-protein clip-seq data, such as sequences, structures, genomic context. each source of data has a different kind of representation and correlation structure. a popular straightforward idea is to integrate these data to construct a predictor, which is expected to be very useful for enhancing the prediction accuracy. two integration schemes have been widely used in the literatures: 
feature-level fusion. this type of fusion strategy is to encode the different sources into feature vectors, which will be concatenated together. for instance, the olimoss model has integrated tetranucleotide sequence, binding motifs and secondary structures to predict protein specific interactions on rnas by simply concatenating the different sources of features into one high-dimensional features   <cit> , which may result in difficulties for the following statistical learning process. for instance, the learning algorithm used in the olimoss is support vector machine , which will easily suffer from the curse of dimension problem. similar strategy is also applied in dna-protein binding sites prediction  <cit> . the other implementation of feature-level fusion is the multiple-kernel learning, which design multiple kernels for different features, and then combine them together  <cit> . similarly, graphprot encodes the sequence and structure information to graph kernel to predict binding reference of rbps  <cit> .

decision-level fusion. to solve the high-dimension space learning problem, decision level-based fusion system has been proposed. for instance, the ionmf  <cit>  is a predictor for predicting rna-protein interaction sites. it has trained a model for each of available resource data, e.g. kmer sequence, secondary structure, clip co-binding, gene ontology  information, and region type. these independent  <dig> models will work independently, which have no interconnections between them during the training processes. the final prediction outputs of the whole system are the fusion of  <dig> independent predictions.




despite the progresses of previously proposed methods, they have a shared drawback that the models were constructed on the features extracted from the observed data, where the frequent noise may make the subsequent classifiers learn wrong knowledge. deep learning  <cit>  is a recently developed approach, which works in a hybrid multiple-layer abstraction way by mapping the observed data to a much high-level abstraction space, where the prediction model will be constructed. this new type of approach has provided much attractive solutions for integrating heterogeneous data and are effective in automatically learning complex patterns from multiple simple raw inputs.

one typical deep learning framework is known as the convolutional neural network   <cit> . the advantage of cnn is that it does not separate feature extraction and model learning into two independent steps any more as done in the traditional statistical learning algorithms. instead it simultaneously learns features and classification models from the original input in a data-driven way, which will reduce the potential mismatch effects between the feature extraction and learning classification models. the cnn model has been applied in the binding proteins prediction of dna or rna. for instance, a recent cnn-based deep learning approach deepbind was proposed to predict sequence specificities for protein binding rna/dna  <cit> . similarly, the deepsea  <cit>  utilized the deep cnns to learn regulatory sequence motifs for predicting dna functions from chromatin profiling data; basset  <cit>  trained analogous deep cnn models to learn impacts of dna sequences variants on chromatin regulation from large-scale dnase-seq data. these studies have shown that the convolution operation in cnn is able to scan a set of weight matrix  across the input sequences to recognize relevant patterns that respond to motifs, like patterns corresponding to edges and curve fragments in images  <cit> , resulting in better prediction accuracies  <cit> .

the deep belief network  is another deep learning algorithm to learn high-level features from large-scale data  <cit> , which is also a recent popular choice for constructing the computational models. for example, the deepnet-rbp fuses the structural and k-mer sequence features to predict rbp interaction sites  <cit>  using dbns. dann trains a dbn to annotate non-coding variants  <cit> , which is able to capture non-linear abstraction features. we also developed a model called ipminer by applying the stacked autoencoder to learn high-level features for predicting rna-protein interactions from raw sequence composition features, and it yielded promising performance compared to other sequence-based methods  <cit> . it’s worth noting that many studies have shown that the cnn and dbn hold their own advantages due to different deep learning architectures, e.g. cnn is more appropriate for sequence data and dbn prefers to the numeric inputs. this motivates us to consider how to integrate the merits of cnn and dbn for better prediction of rbp binding sites and find the sequence motifs.

in this study, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework ideep, a hybrid framework with cnns and dbns, to better integrate multiple heterogeneous data sources for predicting rbp interaction sites on rnas . for the data represented by the binary or numeric features, the dbn networks will be used; while for the sequence data, the cnn network will be applied. different deep network models will be trained and tuned together from the top shared layer to the individual bottom layers using backpropagation, and then the shared latent features are captured across them. compared to the existing approaches, the ideep has the following merits: 1) the ideep is constructed with a deep learning structure, and it consists of multiple neural networks stacked together  <cit> , where the outputs of each layer are the inputs of successive layer. such layer-by-layer learning helps to reduce the noise effects in the original input. 2) the ideep successfully integrates the cnn and dbn for dealing with the different sources of protein-rna binding related data to enhance the discrimination ability. the cnn is able to capture regulatory motifs, which are recurring patterns in rna sequences with a biological function. the dbn learns high-level features regarded as a joint distribution determined by hidden variables for different inputs. 3) the hybrid framework of flexible multimodal learning and fusion at an abstraction level makes the ideep handle different features in an easy manner. the top shared hidden layer at the fusion level will help discover the shared properties across different modalities  <cit> .

RESULTS
in this study, we evaluated ideep on independent testing datasets, and also compared it with the performance of dbn and cnn from individual sources of data. to demonstrate the advantage of ideep, some state-of-art predictors of ionmf, deepbind, and oli were also compared. besides, a large-scale analysis has been conducted to demonstrate the discovered binding motifs using ideep.

the ideep’s performance
to demonstrate the ability of ideep for predicting rna-protein binding sites, we evaluate ideep on independent testing dataset . we firstly use  <dig> training samples for model training,  <dig> validation sites are evaluated at the end of each training epoch to monitor the convergence. for each experiment, ideep is trained with the same initializations. after we obtain the trained model, we apply it to predict binding sites for  <dig> independent testing samples. the roc on  <dig> experiments are shown in fig.  <dig>  it indicates that ideep yields different performance on different experiments with huge margin, the auc ranges from  <dig>  for protein elavl1-mnase to  <dig>  for protein pum <dig>  in addition, ideep achieves the auc greater than  <dig>  on  <dig> of  <dig> experiments, and the average auc of ideep on all experiments is  <dig> . to make a more accurate performance estimate of ideep, we also run the 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance, ideep yields the average auc  <dig>  . the results indicate that ideep accurately predict rbp binding sites on a genome-wide scale.

comparing ideep with other state-of-the-art methods
we firstly compare it with state-of-the-art method ionmf, which has shown better performance than other existing methods  <cit> , such as graphprot  <cit>  and rnacontext  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  we can see that ideep outperform ionmf on most of the  <dig> experiments, the average auc of the  <dig> experiments increases from  <dig> ± <dig>  of ionmf to  <dig> ± <dig>  of ideep. furthermore, for some experiments, it improves the auc over 24%, such as for protein hnrnpl- <dig>  the auc increases from  <dig>  of ionmf to  <dig>  of ideep. in addition, ideep also performes better than other matrix factorization-based methods nmf  <cit> , snmf  <cit>  and qno  <cit> , which achieves the average auc of  <dig>  ± <dig> ,  <dig>  ± <dig> ,  <dig>  ± <dig>  on  <dig> experiments, respectively.

the boldface indicates this performance is the best among the compared methods




we further compare ideep with another protein-specific method oli  <cit> , which yields an average auc of  <dig> ± <dig> , and 17% lower than the ideep. we find that it has a bigger performance variance than other tested methods. for example, oli performs very bad on some experiments, e.g. auc  <dig>  on hnrnpl- <dig> protein, but on some experiments, its performance is very good, e.g.  <dig>  on pum <dig> protein. for the deepbind  <cit>  approach using the same parameters of cnn integrated in ideep, it achieves an average auc  <dig> ± <dig>  across  <dig> experiments, which performs worse than ideep. the reason is that deepbind cannot yield promising performance across all  <dig> experiments from only sequences.

to demonstrate the merits of the designed framework of ideep, we also compare ideep with its own variant ideep-kmer, whose input modalities are kmer, region type, clip-cobinding and structure using the same network architecture. the only difference is that ideep uses cnn sequence and motif modalities instead of high-dimensional kmer modality. as indicated in table  <dig>  ideep-kmer yields an average auc of  <dig>  ± <dig> , which is worse than ideep, indicating that cnn sequence and motif modality have better discriminating ability than high-dimensional kmer modality. on the other hand, ideep performs faster than ideep-kmer both in the training and testing steps.

overall, compared to other  <dig> tested methods, ideep yields the best performance on  <dig> of  <dig> experiments and the same aucs on other  <dig> experiments. and it achieves a little lower auc only on  <dig> of the  <dig> experiments, but it still yields the aucs above  <dig>  on  <dig> of them. for those experiments with aucs below  <dig>  in other six methods, ideep’s performance is very encouraging. these results indicate that ideep’s promising performance.

comparison between individual modalities
to show the advantage of integrating multiple modalities of data, we also tested the performance on individual modalities. the average aucs of  <dig> experiments for region type, clip-cobinding, structure, motif and cnn sequence are  <dig> ± <dig> ,  <dig> ± <dig> ,  <dig> ± <dig> ,  <dig> ± <dig>  and  <dig> ± <dig> , respectively, indicating that individual deep networks have the ability of learning high-level features for rbp binding sites prediction. from the results, we can see that cnn sequence modality yield the best average performance with roughly 12% improvement over the second most informative region type. and cnn sequence yields higher auc on  <dig> experiments due to sequence specificities of binding rna  <cit> , where cnn sequence can automatically learn binding motifs as feature representations for subsequent classifications. the other  <dig> modalities achieves similar average aucs on all experiments without a big difference. furthermore, we also test the performance of dbn with only kmer modality, it yields the average auc of  <dig> ± <dig>  on  <dig> experiments, which is found much worse than cnn sequence modality.

as indicated in fig.  <dig>  there exists big performance differences on individual experiments for different modalities. for instance, on u2af <dig>  experiment, the  <dig> individual modalities achieve the auc of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the cnn sequence modality obtains auc  <dig> , outperforming other  <dig> modalities. while for experiment elavl1-mnase, they yield the aucs of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. the cnn sequence achieves the worst auc of  <dig>  and the clip-cobinding modality has the best auc of  <dig> . the results showed that there were huge differences between different modalities on different experiments.
fig.  <dig> performance of individual modalities. the comparison for predicting rna-protein binding sites on  <dig> experiment dataset using ideep and individual modalities




among the  <dig> ago <dig> experiments, structure modality performs a little better on  <dig> of them. it is because that ago <dig> protein requires specific rna structure binding interfaces  <cit> . the motif and cnn sequence modalities perform worse than other modalities on the  <dig> ago <dig> experiments. the reason is that ago <dig> protein has a paz domain and a piwi domain, but there are no related binding motifs for them in cisbp-rna database  <cit> , and hence deep network of motif and cnn sequence modalities cannot learn high discriminating features for predicting ago <dig> binding sites on rnas. although motif and cnn sequence modality are not able to detect binding sites for ago <dig> with high accuracy, other modalities can complement with them. the more diversity different modalities have, the more accurate the integrated method is  <cit> . so integrating the  <dig> different modalities using multimodal deep learning makes ideep perform much better than individual modalities.

based on the above results, we can have the following conclusions:  no single modality can beat others on all datasets, their performance varies on different datasets.  the deep network  of input modalities are able to learn high-level features with stronger discriminating ability for rbp interaction sites.  integrated ideep performs better than deep networks of individual modalities, it is because that multimodal deep learning is able to learn shared representation across multiple modalities with strong discriminating ability for rna-protein binding sites.

the correlations between different modalities in deep architecture
in the proposed ideep model, we integrated  <dig> sources of data for an ensemble prediction. it will be interesting to see how the  <dig> independent modalities will complement with each other. we thus investigate the pairwise correlation between the different modalities region type, clip-cobinding, structure, motif, cnn sequence across  <dig> experiments. in addition, we also demonstrate the correlations between the  <dig> modalities and unintegrated high-dimensional k-mer modality.

we calculate the pearson correlation coefficients  based on the aucs of  <dig> experiments from individual modalities. if two modalities have high pcc, they perform similarly across all  <dig> experiments. as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  there are two obvious subgroups between the  <dig> modalities. the region type, clip-cobinding and structure formed the first group; kmer, motif and cnn sequence formed the other group. these results show that different modalities contain various signals, and they can complement with each other via integration in ideep.
fig.  <dig> the correlation between different modalities on  <dig> experiment dataset. the pearson correlation coefficient values are calculated using the aucs from  <dig> experiments for individual modalities




the region type and structure modalities have a pcc of  <dig> , showing that they are highly correlated. it is because the same region type may have similar structures, they share redundant information for predicting binding sites. cnn sequence and kmer also have very high pcc of  <dig> , indicating that they are also highly related. as demonstrated in the ionmf  <cit> , kmer modality can capture binding motifs. cnn sequence also learns motifs using cnn network  <cit> . in addition, both of them are highly correlated to motif modality with pccs of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. it indicates that the high-level features learned from cnn sequences and kmer are closely related to binding motifs, which is consistent with previous findings. in summary, both the modalities try to learn binding motifs, so they share similar signals associated with motifs for rbps across the  <dig> experiments. that is also the reason why we used cnn sequence instead of high-dimensional kmer in ideep.

the ideep is able to discover new binding motifs
the ideep can predict rbp binding sites on rnas with high accuracy, however the principles behind it are still not easily interpretable. so here we further use ideep to discover binding motifs for rbps. in previous methods  <cit> , they focus on directly detecting nucleotide binding sites on rnas from extracted features, but did not introduce the motifs during feature learning. although ionmf tries to infer the binding motifs after model training, it totally depends on the input kmer sequences and defines a background distribution. in addition, it limits the learned motifs to size k, which requires optimization for searching potential motifs and the time cost exponentially increases with k.

to explore the learned motifs, we investigate the convolve filters of the convolutional layers from cnn module in ideep, and convert them into position weight matrices , which is matched against input sequences to discover binding motifs, like deepbind  <cit>  and basset  <cit>  . then, these discovered motifs are aligned against  <dig> known motifs in study  <cit>  from cisbp-rna using the tomtom algorithm  <cit> . in addition, we also provide enrichment and occurrences analysis for the predictive motifs .

using p-value < <dig> , ideep captures most of informative motifs for individual proteins. the significantly matched known motifs for individual experiments are listed in fig.  <dig>  where  <dig> experiments with known motifs in study  <cit>  are included. as can be seen from fig.  <dig> that the ideep is able to mine known motifs for  <dig> of  <dig> experiments. for example, there are  <dig> known motifs  in study  <cit>  for protein elavl1- <dig>  and all of them have been correctly discovered by ideep. fig. 6
a illustrates the heatmap of learned weights of convolve filters of cnn and corresponding matched known motifs for these filters for protein tdp- <dig>  igfbp1- <dig>  and ago <dig>  respectively, and their enrichment adjusted p-value are  <dig> e
− <dig>   <dig> e
− <dig> and  <dig> e
− <dig>  respectively. besides the already well-known motifs discovered by ideep, it is able to find some novel motifs. for instance, for protein tdp- <dig>  currently there are no verified motifs for it in cisbp-rna database, although tdp- <dig> have been discovered to bind to thousands of rnas in neuron  <cit> . figure 6

− <dig> and  <dig> e
− <dig> for protein tdp- <dig> are illustrated in fig. 6
c. these new motifs  will provide important clues for further wet-lab verifications. due to the incompleteness of current database or the insensitivity of the tomtom software, many mined motifs by ideep cannot be matched. it is expected that with more rbp motifs being verified and deposited in the database, more matches will be found. all discovered motifs by ideep and their motif enrichment scores are available at https://github.com/xypan1232/ideep/tree/master/predicted_motifs.

discussion
in ideep, we do not integrate high-dimensional k-mer and go features, which possibly causes the over-fitting problem when calculating the partition functions. in addition, for other  <dig> integrated features in ideep, dropout layer was applied for both cnn and dbn. it randomly sets 0s for some unit activations with certain probabilities, which can avoid over-fitting for model training  <cit> . besides, we also introduce batch normalization and early stopping to prevent the possible over-fitting during the training process  <cit> .

in our  <dig> modalities integrated in ideep, cnn sequence modality outperforms other modalities on most experiments. but for some proteins, such as ago <dig>  it performs worse than structure modality, indicating structure information has better informative signals for ago <dig> binding sites. currently we just use simple probabilities predicted from rnaplfold  <cit>  as the input features, which contain some noises due to the accuracy below 100%. so in future work, we will extend the cnn to structures, and design cnn to find high-level structure motifs for rbp binding sites. as done in graphprot  <cit> , they apply graph encoding to detect structure motifs. we can adopt similar strategy for encoding rna structure to  <dig> elements , which can be fed into cnn for learning structure motifs automatically to further improve ideep’s performance. in addition, ago <dig> binding specificity is provided primarily by mirnas  <cit> , the expressed mirnas in a given cell type greatly influences ago2-rna interactions, resulting in a much more variable and cell type-dependent binding motifs than rna-binding proteins which bind their mrna targets directly. integration of mirna expression as an additional modality will conceivably improve the accuracy of ideep for ago <dig> proteins.

the ideep outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with the average auc of  <dig>  on  <dig> experiments. ideep goes a step further besides predicting the rbp binding sites, it also is able to identify the high-level motifs. the motifs help to understand the correlations of the binding sites and their biological functions. in addition, ideep also discovers some novel binding motifs besides those reported motifs in cisbp-rna, we expect to verify those novel motifs by investigating whether the genes with the same predicted motifs are significantly associated with certain functions. meanwhile, these candidate motifs could provide a quick guide for the wet-lab experiments to avoid very time-consuming search.

in addition, when selecting sequences in windows for creating sequence motifs using weblogo  <cit>  for each convolve filter, we use the cutoff  <dig>  of the maximum activation of this filter over all sequences . this cutoff will remove some positions with no significant information to be selected for generating motifs. however, if we use other cutoffs, e.g.  <dig>  then it might introduce noises. thus, relu may result in the information loss, but it has been found helpful in avoiding the vanishing gradient problem and learning non-linear features  <cit> .

despite the promising performance of ideep, there are still promising avenues to explore the ability of deep learning. currently we only use the standard cnns for sequences and similar dbns for other data modalities with only different number of hidden neurons, which should be designed specifically for different input data. besides, more advanced network architecture could be designed according to the special characteristics of different input data. for example, danq designed a hybrid convolutional and recurrent neural network to predict the functions from non-coding dna sequences  <cit> . it uses cnn to detect regulatory motifs from sequences, followed by bi-directional recurrent layer to capture long-term dependencies between motifs. furthermore, instead of learning high-level features using deep learning, another study aims at automatically learning hand-designed optimization algorithms, which can exploit the structures in network architecture of interest  <cit> . all these studies indicate that we can further improve the structure of current ideep to improve the performance in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we present a deep learning based hybrid framework to integrate different sources of data to predict rna-protein binding sites on rnas from clip-seq data, which yields promising performance on large-scale experiment data. the ideep has the following advantages:  it trains deep neural network on individual sources of data to learn high-level representations for predicting rna-protein interaction sites.  different from other black-box machine learning based approaches, ideep is able to discover the interpretable binding motifs, which provides better biological insights into rbps compared to other black-box machine learning models.  it makes use of multimodal deep learning to extract shared features across different sources of data, with the hypothesis that no single one can overwhelm others across all datasets. multimodal deep learning is able to better fuse them and achieve better performance on all datasets. our proposed deep learning framework provides a powerful approach and choice for heterogeneous data integration.
