BACKGROUND
the nuclear receptors liver x receptor  α and β  are transcription factors that act as sensors for oxidized cholesterol   <cit> . high expression levels of lxrα in metabolic active tissues fit with the central role of the receptor in lipid metabolism, while lxrβ is more ubiquitously expressed  <cit> . interestingly, both lxrs are found in various cells of the immune system such as macrophages, dendritic cells and lymphocytes, which suggests an important function in the innate and adaptive immune response  <cit> . in macrophages the accumulation of excess lipoprotein-derived cholesterol activates lxr and triggers the induction of a transcriptional program for cholesterol efflux, such as atp-binding cassette transporter  a <dig>  and abcg <dig>  while in parallel the receptor transrepresses inflammatory genes, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin 1β and monocyte chemotactic protein- <dig>  <cit> .

oxysterols and intermediates of the biosynthetic cholesterol pathway have been identified as the natural ligands for lxr, while t <dig>  is a potent synthetic lxr agonist with an ec <dig> of about  <dig> nm  <cit> . lxrs bind to dna as a heterodimer with the nuclear receptor retinoid x receptor  on direct repeats  of ggtca core binding motifs with four intervening nucleotides   <cit> . these dr4-type response elements  have been identified in the regulatory regions of a number of primary lxr target genes  <cit> . recently, the first genome-wide views of lxr binding were obtained in a murine macrophage cell line  <cit>  and in mouse liver  <cit> . in the murine macrophage study overexpressed biotin-tagged lxrβ was used for the chromatin immunoprecipitation , followed by massive parallel sequencing . de novo motif analysis identified dr4-type res as the most highly enriched binding sequence, but only  <dig> % of the lxr peaks contained such a dr4-type re. also motifs for the transcription factors pu. <dig> and ap- <dig> were co-enriched  <cit> .

the ability of lxrs to integrate lipid metabolism and immune functions places them in an ideal position to tailor macrophage responses. therefore, we performed a genome-wide analysis of t09-induced lxr binding in macrophage-type phorbol myristate acetate -differentiated thp- <dig> human monocytic leukemia cells by chip-seq using a highly specific anti-lxr antibody. in total we identified  <dig> chromosomal lxr binding locations, of which  <dig> were observed after the t <dig> treatment. at the mrna level the ligand induced  <dig> genes and repressed  <dig> genes. we studied the lxr cistrome and identified lxr-enriched genomic regions as well as individual lxr target genes. binding of lxr is focused on  <dig> genomic regions with individual constellations of binding sites and target genes. we could confirm that lxr controls functions related to lipid metabolism and observed a strong link to apoptosis. therefore, this first report on genome-wide binding of lxr in a human cell line provides new insights into lxr target genes and their link to physiological processes, such as apoptosis.

RESULTS
genome-wide binding of lxr in a human macrophage-type cell line
thp- <dig> human monocytic leukemia cells were treated for  <dig> days with pma to induce a human macrophage-type model and subsequently treated for  <dig> min with the potent synthetic lxr agonist t <dig> or vehicle dmso. chip assays were performed using an antibody specific for lxrα and β . the lxr antibody was successfully used in regular chip assays  <cit>  and also applied in a very recent lxr chip-seq study in mouse liver  <cit> . its specificity is further demonstrated in western blot analysis , where the antibody recognizes both lxrα and lxrβ protein in liver from wild type mice. lxrα is not recognized in lxrα-/- mice, lxrβ is not recognized in lxrβ-/- mice and both lxr bands disappear in the lxrαβ-/- mice. furthermore, the antibody recognizes both human lxrα and lxrβ when they are overexpressed in hela cells. this indicates that the antibody is specific to both mouse and human lxrα and lxrβ.

purified chromatin samples were sequenced using a solexa gaii platform. in order to detect genomic lxr binding locations, we used bowtie software  <cit>  for the read sequence alignment and the macs program  <cit>  for detection of statistically significant pileups of fragments when comparing to igg. the number and overlap of detected lxr binding locations in and between the t09- and vehicle-treated cells are shown in figure 1a . since the use of a single criterion for the selection of a representative peak set could be restrictive for the further analysis, we considered three criteria, each with different stringency.

the first high stringency criterion with false discovery rate  < 1%, fold enrichment  >  <dig> and raw p-value < 10- <dig> showed a higher number of peaks in the ligand-treated sample  than in the vehicle-treated sample , suggesting that the ligand slightly induces lxr binding among the high confidence binding locations. interestingly, the peaks of both t09- and vehicle-treated samples were enriched to exon and intron regions, but ligand treatment clearly increased the density of lxr binding close to the transcription start site  . due to these very stringent criteria the total number of peaks is not very high , but they have proportionally higher overlap between t09- and vehicle-treated samples  than the two following criteria showing overlaps of only  <dig> % and  <dig> %.

the second stringency level using a single criterion of a fdr < 1% increased the number of lxr binding sites in the t09-treated sample to  <dig> peaks and even more  in the vehicle-treated sample. in total, this represents  <dig> lxr binding locations. loosening the stringency to fdr < 5% further increases the total number of lxr binding locations in the vehicle-treated sample  compared to the ligand treatment . in general, ligand treatment seems to increase the number of high confidence peaks and to decrease the number of lower confidence peaks suggesting that liganded lxr is focusing on a fewer number of genomic binding sites of possibly increased importance.

we then applied the de novo motif detection tool meme  <cit>  on the sequences within ±  <dig> bp of the summits of the  <dig> lxr peaks with a fdr < 1%. from the top  <dig> results obtained with the tomtom tool  <cit>  in the t09-treated peaks, only one sequence motif resembled a known transcription factor binding site with similarity score e <  <dig>  this motif has a meme score of e =  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and the tomtom tool indicated its high similarity to two dr4-type lxr consensus matrices reported in the transfac database  . as a major difference, the first two nucleotides of the spacer  seem to form a consensus "ct" in our matrix, whereas in the best matching transfac matrix these positions are not clearly enriched. the motifs reported by meme of the vehicle-treated sample included several compositionally biased hits and none of them could be recognized by tomtom.

further analysis of all  <dig> peak sequences with fdr < 1% using the matrix screening function of the regulatory sequence analysis tools  web server  <cit>  showed that a site similar to the de novo derived dr4-type re or its version with spacer positions  <dig> and  <dig> set equal to any nucleotide  can be found in  <dig> %  of the t09-treated peak set and in  <dig> %  of the vehicle-treated peak set with similarity p < 10- <dig>  when the similarity threshold was reduced to p < 10- <dig> the number of dr4-type res could be increased to  <dig> % and  <dig> % in t09- and vehicle-treated samples, respectively . due to relatively low percentage of dr4-type res, we screened the high stringency lxr peak sequences for the nuclear receptor half-site motif rgktca in a dr 0- <dig>  everted repeat  0- <dig> and inverted repeat  0- <dig> arrangement. this resulted in enrichment for dr1-, dr4- and ir1-type res in the t09-treated sample and dr4- and er9-type res in the vehicle-treated sample . direct lxr-rxr heterodimer binding to dr1- and er9-type res has not yet been found, but it had been reported on an ir1-type re  <cit> .

screening of the lxr peak sequences with all  <dig> non-redundant jaspar database matrices , without dr4-type lxr re among them, resulted in the following five most frequent motifs in the t09-treated sample : ewsr1-fli <dig> , klf <dig> , rreb <dig> , sp <dig>  and the dr1-type re pparg:rxr . in the vehicle-treated sample these were ewsr1-fli <dig> , myf , sp <dig> , rreb <dig>  and spib . among the top motifs spib represents a purine-rich ets-type motif, which is also recognized by the transcription factor pu. <dig>  previously found in the lxr chip-seq analysis from the murine macrophage cell line raw <dig>   <cit> . the ewsr1-fli <dig> matrix also represents a binding site for ets-type transcription factors with various functions, such as cell cycle regulation and cell migration  <cit> . rreb <dig> is known to relate to ras-mediated cell differentiation  <cit>  and sp <dig> and klf <dig> both represent binding sites for klf-family proteins, where klf <dig> is known to drive the differentiation of immune cells  <cit> . as the motif pparg:rxr was the fifth most frequent in the t09-treated sample and the pparg gene was also detected as up-regulated with a fc =  <dig>  in our microarray at  <dig> h, we decided to search peaks with fdr < 1% for motifs pparg::rxra  and pparg , available in jaspar. these covered together  <dig> %  of the t09-treated and  <dig> %  of the vehicle-treated peak set with a similarity p < 10- <dig>  interestingly, most of the peaks containing a pparγ binding motif did not contain any dr4-type re motif  in the t09-treated and  <dig> of  <dig> peaks  in the vehicle-treated peak set). these results indicate that some of the lxr peaks observed in chip-seq data could be explained by an indirect dna binding of lxr via other transcription factors, such as pparγ, or by cooperative direct dna binding of lxr together with some of the mentioned transcription factors.

a large part  of the lxr binding locations in the high stringency set  represent the well understood case of lxr being present on its genomic binding site both before and after the ligand treatment. this is illustrated at the genomic region of the well-known lxr target gene abca <dig>  <cit>  showing four peaks from the stringent set and one additional from the fdr < 1% set . this observation corroborates our previous report of lxr binding sites on the abca <dig> gene by regular chip assays  <cit> . moreover, of the five sites observed at the abca <dig> gene, three contain dr4-type res and four correspond to those detected previously in the first mouse lxr chip-seq study  <cit> . all five peaks were also occupied by lxr in the absence of ligand, but after t <dig> treatment the intensity of lxr binding increased. interestingly, the five lxr locations and the abca <dig> tss are contained within the same block, which is flanked by ctcf binding sites  that are known as chromatin barrier insulators. this suggests that this genomic region displays the complete set of binding sites needed to understand the lxr regulation of the abca <dig> gene.

in summary, depending on chosen stringency criteria we detected in a human macrophage-type cell line between  <dig> and  <dig> genomic lxr binding sites. the only identified de novo motif in the peak areas was a dr4-type re, but matrix screening also identified binding sites for other transcription factors, such as pparγ. the example of the abca <dig> locus indicates that our chip-seq data can fully explain the lxr regulation of a t <dig> target gene.

spatial clusters of lxr binding locations and regulated genes
next we studied the genome-wide clustering of lxr binding sites and the location of target genes within the clustered chromosomal regions with enrichment of binding locations. we stimulated macrophage-type pma-treated thp- <dig> cells for  <dig> h with t <dig> or vehicle , extracted total rna and analyzed it on illumina human ht- <dig> v <dig> expression beadchip gene expression microarrays. statistical analysis detected  <dig> regulated genes , out of which  <dig> were up and  <dig> down-regulated . the response already after  <dig> h suggests that these genes are primary lxr target genes.

the genome-wide organization of the high stringency set of  <dig> lxr binding locations  and of the  <dig> t09-regulated genes in their physical context is shown in figure  <dig> using window density based visualization. this visualization shows the densities of chip-seq peaks and regulated genes across the genome within  <dig> mb windows. the window densities are weighted by the fes of chip-seq peaks and the log <dig> fold changes  of the differentially expressed  genes, which emphasizes high peaks or extremely differentially expressed genes. subsequent analysis of the window density data using segmentation  to detect the exact borders of the peak-enriched regions resulted in the indicated  <dig> distinct genomic areas. regions with ≥  <dig> peaks and ≥  <dig> t09-regulated genes are highlighted in red and listed in table  <dig> .

the genomic regions that contain two or more lxr binding sites and three or more t09-regulated genes . the locations of each region, the number of lxr peaks and the number and name of the regulated genes are indicated .

generally, the distribution of lxr binding locations in the genome-wide view  correlates with the density of all genes  and slightly with the density of differentially expressed genes , but the number of lxr peaks in the  <dig> hotspots does not correlate with the proportion of de genes in these regions nor with the density of de genes in these regions . in a more detailed view, we correlated each of the  <dig> hotspot regions with the number of measured up-regulated  and down-regulated  genes with the number of expected up- or down-regulated genes. using a binomial test with threshold p < <dig>  to indicate statistical significance, we identified in both groups several regions that contain an unexpected high number of de genes. region r <dig> in chromosome  <dig>  and region r <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  are examples of this type of analysis. region r <dig> contains six up- and five down-regulated genes and two high stringency lxr locations present in both t09- and vehicle-treated samples. the high stringency lxr location close to the t <dig> target genes egr <dig>  and etf <dig>  is shown in higher resolution . region r <dig> contains eight down- and two up-regulated genes and five high stringency lxr locations in the t <dig> sample and four in the dmso sample, two of which are overlapping. here the region upstream of the t <dig> target genes gpr <dig> , trmt <dig>  and prdx <dig>  is shown in higher resolution .

however, there are also several differences in the location of lxr binding sites and t <dig> target genes. one of the most obvious differences is the differential expression of several genes on the x chromosome . with the exception of region r <dig> located at the 3' end of the x chromosome no lxr binding location in neither the high stringent nor in the fdr < 1% peak set could be detected. these genes without any lxr binding locations nearby may either represent effects of t <dig> that are not mediated by lxr, secondary targets of lxr or effects that are not visible in the chip-seq dataset at the investigated time point. it should be noted that t <dig> has been shown to be also a ligand of other nuclear receptor superfamily members, such as farnesoid x receptor  <cit> , pregnane x receptor  <cit> , retinoid acid receptor-related orphan receptor  <cit>  and androgen receptor  <cit> . however, based on our microarray analysis the genes encoding for farnesoid x receptor and pregnane x receptor, nr1h <dig> and nr1i <dig>  are not expressed in pma-differentiated thp- <dig> cells used in this study.

taken together, the genome-wide correlation of the  <dig> high stringency lxr locations with  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated t <dig> target genes indicated  <dig> genomic hotspots for the actions of lxr. each of these hotspot regions provides a genomic scenario, where up to seven lxr binding sites may explain the regulation of up to eleven t <dig> target genes.

identification of direct lxr target genes
in order to discriminate those t <dig> target genes that are directly regulated by lxr compared to indirect lxr targets or no lxr targets at all, we examined the co-location of lxr chip-seq peaks with the tss of de genes within proximal  and distal  regions of peak summits . for the proximal regions we used the looser criterion with fdr < 5%, whereas for the distal region we used the more stringent criterion fdr < 1%. from the  <dig> de t <dig> target genes  <dig> showed a lxr site within their proximal region and  <dig> a lxr peak within their distal region,  <dig> of which are overlapping . this selection filtered out 38%  of the t09-regulated genes resulting in  <dig>   <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated, more probable direct lxr target genes .

the  <dig> genes with a lxr peak within  <dig> mb of their tss are marked in the list of all t <dig> target genes  and those that show an adjusted p < <dig>  for differential expression and a proximal t09-induced lxr binding site are summarized in table  <dig>  from this selection we show the locus of the most up-regulated genes, naca , flanked by the ptges <dig>  and prim <dig> , which together form the core of region r <dig> . another exemplified locus is the most down-regulated gene, slc3a <dig> , located in region r <dig> . in both examples there are dominant t09-induced tandem lxr peaks controlling the respective region, i.e. both the up-regulated  and the down-regulated  genes appear to follow the same mechanism of a t09-induced lxr binding. in addition, we made a comparison with the lxr locations found previously in mouse macrophages  <cit>  in a distance of  <dig> kb from the target gene tss regions . among all  <dig> differentially expressed human genes only  <dig> %  showed lxr binding in the corresponding mouse region. furthermore, among the  <dig> selected target genes only  <dig> %  contained an lxr peak in the corresponding genomic region in mouse macrophages. finally, from the human genes with proximal lxr peaks   <dig> %  of their mouse homolog also showed lxr binding.

only genes with a t <dig> peak with fdr < 1% within ±  <dig> kb from their tss are displayed . symbols for peaks are as follows: s = stringent peak with fdr < 1%, fe >  <dig> and p < 10-10; m = peak with fdr < 1%; l = peak with fdr < 5%; x = any peak.

next we compared altered expression of lxr target genes to the occurrence of dr4-type res within the proximal lxr peaks . although dr4-type res with very high similarity scores are not very common , they seem to be enriched to the peaks in the vicinity of de genes, especially when located nearby up-regulated genes . this is consistent with the principal activation mechanism of lxr. the six up-regulated genes abca <dig>  abcg <dig>  smpdl3a , nr1h <dig>  scd  and tatdn <dig>  and the three down-regulated genes cnnm <dig> , hars  and puf <dig>  have lxr binding location with a motif highly similar  to a dr4-type re. the abca <dig> gene is one of the best-known lxr target genes and contains even three dr4-type res within its regulatory region . another example, the smpdl3a gene, carries two dr4-type res within an lxr twin peak very close to its tss . using quantitative real-time pcr  and rna from independently performed stimulation experiments of pma-differentiated thp- <dig> cells with the synthetic lxr ligands t <dig> and gw <dig> , we validated nine representative lxr targets genes: the known targets abca <dig>  abcg <dig>  mylip , nr1h <dig> and scd and the novel targets pparg, smpdl3a, adm  and acsl <dig>  . after  <dig> h of ligand treatment all nine genes were significantly up-regulated by both lxr ligands.

in summary,  <dig> of the  <dig> t <dig> responding genes are probable direct targets of lxr, since 77% of them have at least one lxr binding site within  <dig> kb of their tss and the further 23% show at least one lxr peak within  <dig> mb distance. interestingly, highly regulated lxr target genes have a higher probability to contain a dr4-type res within the lxr peak associated with these genes.

association of functions to lxr target genes
in order to gain further insight into the possible common functions of the  <dig> presumed direct lxr target genes identified, we performed a functional annotation analysis using the david tool  <cit>  and gene ontology  biological process terms. this resulted in  <dig> go terms with fdr < 5% mostly related to general themes, such as metabolism, translation and rna processing . among these,  <dig> genes are related to regulation of programmed cell death  and  <dig> genes to regulation of apoptosis . interestingly, the immune-related terms are not enriched significantly, as the best ranking immune-related term "somatic diversification of immune receptors via germline recombination" is only related to five lxr target genes with fdr =  <dig> %. we also analyzed separately a more specific gene list, a subset of  <dig> genes, with p <  <dig>  for differential expression . also here we mostly found more general functions, such as translation and rna processing, and only two terms related to lipid handling. none of the terms were directly related to immune function but the two terms "cellular response to stress" and "response to virus" were detected. separate analysis of genes with different binding profiles of lxr in their vicinity  did not show any significant enrichment of additional pathways . this suggests a homogeneous function of lxr targets independent of possible different regulatory mechanisms.

the analysis was performed using the david tool  <cit>  for the specific set of lxr target genes with p <  <dig>  for differential expression. go biological process terms with fdr < 5% are shown. columns indicate the go-term, its count and percentage in the target gene list, as well as the p-value, fe and fdr for the enrichment.

in order to detect the non-redundant sets of genes and associated biological themes, we performed a clustering analysis using enriched gene categories from the databases go, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes , reactome and cgap tissue est expression for the  <dig> true lxr target genes. in order to ease the later inspection of results, we limited the number of genes used in the clustering analysis to the  <dig> most up-regulated and the  <dig> most down-regulated, preserving the same ratio as between all  <dig> and  <dig> up- and down-regulated lxr target genes. for the annotations, we used all that were enriched with fdr < 50%, corresponding to the raw p ≤  <dig>  in the go enrichment analysis. we were able to use this loose criterion and obtain adequate data, because the clustering is robust to false positive annotations. the genes and associated annotations were clustered and visualized in parallel using the heatmap. <dig> function available in the r-package gplots  <cit> . agglomerative hierarchical clustering with an asymmetric binary distance measure was used by treating each association between a gene and an annotation as  <dig> and a lack of association as  <dig>  this resulted in eight visually homogeneous clusters of associated genes and annotations : translation-related genes , oxidation- and diabetes-related genes expressed in liver , mrna processing-related genes , nitrogen metabolism-related genes , programmed cell death regulation-related genes , ubiquitin system genes with relation to cell cycle and apoptosis , genes related to intracellular transport including cholesterol transport  and general ubiquitin system-related genes .

taken together, functional annotation analysis of the  <dig> true lxr target genes using go, kegg, reactome and cgap tissue est expression databases resulted in eight clusters, in which the functions apoptosis and lipid transport are found, but no link to immune functions were observed.

discussion
this study provides the first genome-wide view of lxr binding patterns in a human cell line using chip-seq assays. we performed this study in pma-differentiated thp- <dig> cells, a macrophage-type cellular system, which increases our understanding not only of the well-known role of lxr in lipid metabolism and transport, but also the receptor's assumed role in innate immunity and other physiological processes.

the highly stringent analysis of the chip-seq peaks obtained from pma-treated thp- <dig> cells after a  <dig> min stimulation with the synthetic lxr ligand t <dig> or its vehicle dmso yielded a surprisingly low number of  <dig> genome-wide binding locations of the receptor. however, from the  <dig> lxr sites observed in the presence of t <dig>  57%  are also bound in the absence of ligand. this supports the canonical model for nuclear receptor binding being valid for most members of the superfamily  <cit> . according to this model the receptor binds genomic dna already in the absence of ligand, probably in a complex with co-repressor and histone deacetylase proteins, and locally represses the chromatin structure. the addition of ligand induces a conformational change in the ligand-binding domain of the receptor, which then leads to dissociation of the co-repressor proteins and the recruitment of co-activators that open chromatin structure. alternatively, co-activators act as mediators building a bridge to the basal transcription machinery, which leads to the activation of rna polymerase ii and gene transcription. according to the data presented here, this model seems to apply for a number of known lxr binding sites close to target genes, such as abca <dig> 

a lower stringency in the detection of lxr chip-seq peaks increased the number of sites substantially, to a total of  <dig>  or even  <dig> . however, with this increase of putative lxr binding sites the percentage of overlapping sites reduced to  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively, while the percentage of apparent binding sites in the absence of ligand increased to  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. we assume that most of the latter sites are not genomic locations from which lxr initiates gene activation, but rather unspecific contact points of the genome with no functional impact. however, the tendency that ligand stimulation reduces the number of sites to less than half  suggests that in its ligand-activated state lxr makes a more focused selection of genomic targets.

surprisingly, only  <dig> % of the lxr peak summit sequences contain a dr4-type re, which, based on in vitro studies, is the only high affinity dna binding site for lxr-rxr heterodimers. this fits with the observations of the two presently published mouse lxr chip-seq studies, where only  <dig> %  <cit>  or up to 8%  <cit>  of the lxr peaks contained a dr4-type re. in a very recent chip-on-chip report,  <dig> lxrβ-rxr binding sites were identified within promoter regions of normal human epidermal keratinocytes  <cit> . although  <dig>  of these rather large genomic fragments contain a kind of dr4-type re, only  <dig>  of them are highly scored, resulting in a very similar percentage as in our human and the mouse chip-seq studies. for comparison, in our chip-seq study on genomic vitamin d receptor  locations in undifferentiated thp- <dig> cells  <cit> , we found only 31% of the vdr peak summits containing a vdr-specific dr3-type re. we obtained the same result also by a re-analysis of vdr chip-seq data from human lymphoblast cell lines  <cit> . these observations indicate that either the binding specificity of lxr  is in the chromatin context far different than in in vitro assays  or lxr is not directly contacting dna, but sits "piggyback" on another dna-binding transcription factor. interestingly, in our t <dig> microarray the pparg gene is  <dig> -fold up-regulated, a value that was also confirmed by qpcr with two different lxr ligands. in parallel, we found for  <dig> % of all lxr peaks in the t09-treated sample a pparγ binding site. this suggests that pparγ may be involved in the regulation of a subset of the lxr target genes. boergesen et al. reported very recently that in mouse liver many genomic binding sites of lxr are also bound by pparα, which is the predominant ppar subtype in liver  <cit> . they suggest that pparα helps lxr in recognizing its preferred genomic locations, a concept that may apply also for pparγ in macrophages. furthermore, boergesen et al. also found a higher percentage of dr1-type res below their lxr chip-seq peaks than dr4-type res, but in sum this can explain only less than 25% of all lxr locations. therefore, they assume that both lxr and ppar are far more promiscuous in the recognition of their binding sites as suggested by in vitro studies.

nevertheless, we found dr4-type res as functional lxr binding sites in a number of prominent and highly ligand-responsive lxr target genes, such as abca <dig>  abcg <dig>  nr1h <dig> and scd. moreover, in a reasonable number of gene regulatory scenarios two or more genomic lxr binding sites seem to work together in the regulation of a gene cluster  or individual genes . these multiple re arrangements confirm observations from single gene analyses with other nuclear receptors, such as the vdr  <cit> .

more important than the actual number of individual lxr binding sites may be their spatial clustering along the genome. we identified  <dig> genomic regions of an average size of  <dig>  mb that contain clusters of highly stringent lxr binding sites and up to  <dig> t <dig> target genes. in total we identified  <dig> t <dig> target genes within these genomic lxr hotspots. although each of these regions displays a rather individual arrangement of lxr binding sites in relation to up- and down-regulated genes, they seem to represent the core of the genome-wide activities of lxr. however,  <dig> of the  <dig> regions do not have any t <dig> target gene, suggesting that these stringent lxr locations may have effects on more distant target genes.

in total our microarray analysis of the  <dig> h t09-stimulated human macrophage-type cells lists  <dig> genes, 73% of which are up-regulated, i.e. more than double as many genes are up-regulated than down-regulated. out of these t <dig> target genes,  <dig>  are found within the  <dig> genomic lxr hotspots,  <dig> genes  have an lxr binding site within  <dig> kb distance from the respective gene's tss and for a further  <dig> genes  an lxr location within  <dig> mb of the tss could be identified. this rate is similar to other reports comparing chip-seq and microarray results  <cit> . nevertheless, this raises the question about the regulation of the  <dig> t <dig> target genes without an lxr peak. these genes may be secondary lxr targets. as only 15% of them are down-regulated, a trans-repression mechanism is not very likely.

our study confirmed a number of known primary lxr target genes, such as abca <dig>  abcg <dig>  mylip, nr1h <dig> and scd, but we identified also a number of previously unknown, novel lxr targets. the most up-regulated lxr target gene, naca, encodes for the nascent polypeptide associated complex alpha protein, which is associated to translation and protein folding related processes and when depleted is responsible of triggering endoplasmic reticulum stress-driven apoptosis in hypoxic cells  <cit> . the ptges <dig> gene, which is co-located with the naca gene, encodes for the co-chaperone protein prostaglandin e synthase  <dig> and is required together with the primary chaperone proteins for proper folding and functioning of the glucocorticoid receptor and other steroid receptors  <cit> . the most down-regulated gene, slc3a <dig>  is related to various processes, for instance in the migration of leukocytes from blood to the central nervous system  <cit> , but also to serum cholesterol levels  <cit> . also the smpdl3a gene is an interesting new lxr target, but it has not yet been well characterized as there is only one report linking smpdl3a to bladder tumorigenesis  <cit> .

lxr actions have been related to a number of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis  <cit> , rheumatoid arthritis  <cit>  and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  <cit> . interestingly, the association of lxr with autoimmune and metabolic diseases is also one of the major results of the annotation analysis of the  <dig> t <dig> responding genes that we consider as true lxr target genes. the analysis showed the expected relation to lipid metabolism and transport genes, but did not provide any significant link to genes related to innate immunity. however, the lxr regulation of inflammatory cytokines is generally observed in experimental settings, where lipopolysaccharide is used for stimulation and where longer lxr ligand treatment times are allowed  <cit> . under these conditions inflammatory cytokines are induced via the transcription factors ap <dig> and nf-κb and can be inhibited via tethered lxr. in this study, we used pma for the differentiation of thp- <dig> cells and t <dig> treatment of only  <dig> h. interestingly, under our experiment conditions, we observed a strong association with apoptosis as more than  <dig> genes within the  <dig> candidates are related to this physiological process. the link of lxrs to apoptosis has is already been reported, not only in macrophages  <cit> , but also in pancreatic β-cells  <cit>  and different cancer cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we present here the first genome-wide view on lxr locations in a human macrophage-type cellular system. the core action of lxr is focused on  <dig> genomic hotspots that contain  <dig> target genes. in total  <dig> of the  <dig> lxr target genes can be explained by a direct action of lxr, many of which have not been reported before. these genes are related to lipid metabolism and transport and to apoptosis, but not directly to immune functions.
