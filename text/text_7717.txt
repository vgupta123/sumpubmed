BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  remains a major health problem worldwide; the world health organisation  estimates that there were  <dig>  million new cases and  <dig>  million deaths from tb in  <dig>  <cit> . bacillus calmette-guérin  is currently the only available vaccine against tuberculosis. this vaccine protects against the most severe forms of the disease, milliary and meningeal tuberculosis; however, it is highly variable in its ability to protect against pulmonary tuberculosis . there are several reasons for this variability, including differences between bcg substrains, exposure to non-tuberculous mycobacteria , the nutritional or genetic background of the population, differences in trial methods and variations between different clinical mycobacterium tuberculosis strains  <cit> .

use of bcg in the early 1920s proved effective in protecting against tb, leading to distribution of the vaccine in many countries. this distribution process and subsequent preservation resulted in the generation of numerous bcg substrains with different morphological, biochemical and immunological features  <cit> . several studies on bcg substrains have demonstrated changes at the genetic level, and comparative analyses of m. tuberculosis, m. bovis and m. bovis bcg have identified region of difference  and tandem duplication  markers in these strains  <cit> .

regions of difference are dna regions that are deleted in the m. bovis and m. bovis bcg genomes compared to m. tuberculosis. the rd <dig> region is involved in bcg attenuation  <cit> . it has been shown that deletion of this region in m. tuberculosis h37rv leads to attenuation of the strain  <cit> ; however, complementation of bcg pasteur with rd <dig> does not fully restore virulence to wild-type levels  <cit> . bcg strains can be sub-classified according to the presence or absence of rd <dig> in early and late strains, respectively. recently, kozak et al. reported that bcg pasteur, a strain that lacks rd <dig>  exhibits decreased immunogenicity compared to bcg russia, a strain that has retained rd <dig>  <cit> . importantly, these two strains show no difference in their level of protection against pulmonary tuberculosis. additionally, castillo-rodal et al. have shown that the rds described to date do not correlate with the protective efficacy of bcg substrains in a murine model  <cit> . the differences observed among bcg strains suggest that additional attenuating mutations may be involved in the attenuation of individual bcg strains.

analysis of the bcg pasteur 1173p <dig> genome sequence has made it possible to construct a detailed genealogy of bcg vaccines. bcg substrains are classified into four groups  based on rd and du <dig> markers  <cit> . furthermore, single-nucleotide polymorphisms  that are unique to particular bcg substrains or shared among substrains have been identified. some of these snps have functional implications for the affected genes. for example, a snp in mma <dig>  is responsible for the lack of methoxymycolate production in late bcg substrains  <cit> .

the evidence presented above supports further characterisation of bcg substrains to improve our understanding of the mechanisms and impact of attenuation to rational design of new vaccines and therapeutics for tuberculosis  <cit> .

even though it was one of the most widely used substrains for vaccination in mexico, bcg mexico  <dig> has not been included in any previous comparative proteomic or genomic study of bcg strains. characterisation of bcg mexico  <dig> will permit again its use for bcg vaccine production in mexico. this bcg strain will be used to develop a new recombinant bcg vaccine. recently, hayashi et al. described the biochemical characteristics of  <dig> bcg strains , as well as m. bovis, m. tuberculosis, m. avium and m. smegmatis strains. interestingly, bcg mexico presented a biochemical profile more similar to that of m. bovis than any other bcg strain  <cit> .

historical records show that the pasteur institute sent several shipments of bcg strains to mexico between  <dig> and  <dig> . in  <dig>  small-scale production of bcg vaccine began in mexico. in  <dig>  a bcg vaccine production laboratory was opened, and the vaccine was distributed throughout mexico and latin america  <cit> . since  <dig>  the bcg mexico substrain has been maintained by the laboratorios de biológicos y reactivos de mexico, a state-owned company that produces biological agents in mexico. the bcg mexico substrain was used as the vaccine seed for many years  <cit> . in  <dig>  this strain was replaced with the bcg danish  <dig> strain for vaccine production  <cit> . in  <dig>  bcg vaccine production ended in mexico; since then, the country has depended on imported vaccine. these changes in vaccine production have caused confusion regarding the identity of bcg mexico. for this reason, we characterised three representative strains used for bcg vaccine production in mexico, which are designated bcg mexico  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> according to the production period in which they were used. in this report, we describe the genomic and proteomic features of bcg mexico  <dig> 

RESULTS
rd and du profile of bcg mexico strains
our rd and du profile analysis of bcg mexico  <dig> demonstrated the presence of the rd <dig>  rd <dig>  rd <dig> and rd danish/glaxo regions and the absence of the rd <dig>  rd <dig> and n-rd <dig> regions, as well as a single copy of the insertion sequence is <dig>  these properties are similar to those observed for bcg phipps and bcg tice . in contrast, bcg mexico  <dig> and bcg mexico  <dig> exhibited identical rd and du profiles, with the rd <dig>  rd <dig> and rd danish/glaxo regions and one copy of is <dig> missing . this profile is identical to that of bcg danish. the absence of the rd danish/glaxo region, which is specific to bcg danish, in bcg mexico  <dig> and  <dig> confirms this result and is consistent with historical records indicating that bcg vaccine production in mexico utilised the bcg danish  <dig> strain beginning in  <dig>

the symbol  indicates the loss of a region in the genome of a given strain, whereas the symbol  indicates the presence of the region. rd = region of difference; is <dig> = insertion sequence is <dig> ; du = tandem duplication.

the amplification pattern of du regions in bcg mexico  <dig> indicated duplication of du2-iv, in contrast to those of bcg mexico  <dig> and bcg mexico  <dig>  which showed duplication of du2-iii . these differences in rds and dus confirm that bcg mexico  <dig> is a different strain from bcg mexico  <dig> and  <dig>  which are related to bcg danish.

the above results and subsequent sequencing of the bcg mexico  <dig> genome place this strain in du <dig> group iv within the genealogy of bcg strains . these results differ from findings of previous studies in which bcg mexico was placed in du <dig> group iii as a strain derived from bcg danish, which is an erroneous result that can be attributed to the different bcg vaccine production periods in mexico  <cit> .

genome sequence of bcg mexico 1931
mycobacterium bovis bcg mexico  <dig> has a circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp with an overall g+c content of  <dig> % . the genome contains  <dig>  genes that encode proteins , three genes that encode rrnas and  <dig> genes that encode trnas. additionally,  <dig> possible pseudogenes have been identified . the bcg mexico  <dig> genome is  <dig> kb smaller than those of bcg pasteur 1173p <dig>  and bcg tokyo  <dig> . the differences between bcg mexico  <dig> and bcg pasteur are due to lack of du <dig>  the presence of specific deletions and the presence of rd <dig> in bcg mexico  <dig>  with respect to bcg tokyo  <dig>  the difference in genome size can be explained by the loss of rd <dig>  n-rd <dig> and one copy of insertion sequence is <dig> as well as by differences in the size of du <dig> .

the genome of bcg mexico  <dig> contains fewer genes  than those of bcg pasteur  and bcg tokyo   <cit> . this variation is due to the presence of different rds in each strain and to differences in the criteria used for annotation of hypothetical proteins not previously described in other bcg strains but annotated in m. tuberculosis strains .

a comparison of the bcg mexico  <dig> genome sequence with those of bcg pasteur and bcg tokyo revealed  <dig> snps and three new rd regions, which were designated rdmex <dig> , rdmex <dig>  and rdmex <dig> . these regions were deleted in the bcg mexico  <dig> sequence based on alignment with the bcg pasteur and bcg tokyo sequences. the deletions were confirmed by alignment with the m. tuberculosis and m. bovis sequences. these new rd regions led to the loss of three genes  and the partial deletion of two genes  in bcg mexico  <dig> . interestingly, a pcr screen of these regions in nine bcg strains  showed that the rdmex <dig> and rdmex <dig> regions have been lost only in bcg mexico  <dig> and can therefore be used as molecular markers for this strain.

1locations and names of affected genes are given according to the bcg pasteur 1173p <dig> genome; 2also deleted in bcg danish  <dig> 

rdmex <dig> is an intergenic deletion located between the bcg <dig>  and bcg <dig>  genes, which encode two subunits of the 30s ribosomal protein. the biological effect of this deletion is unknown.

rdmex <dig> is associated with deletion of  <dig> aa from bcg <dig> , affecting a conserved region of the protein that includes two transmembrane domains. this gene encodes a probable fatty-acyl coa ligase involved in lipid degradation. lynett et al. have reported that this protein is involved in sulpholipid production and that disruption of the gene results in increased association between bacteria and macrophages  <cit> . molina et al. found that bcg mexico  <dig> associates more strongly with macrophages  compared to bcg danish, bcg moreau, bcg phipps and bcg tokyo <dig>  <cit> .

finally, rdmex <dig> was the largest deletion found in the bcg mexico  <dig> genome. it affected four genes: three genes encoding hypothetical proteins  and another gene encoding a putative transcriptional regulator  belonging to the whib protein family . this family has been proposed to form part of a new redox system in m. tuberculosis  <cit> . interestingly, this deletion is situated in the extended rd <dig> region.

the new rds described in bcg mexico  <dig> may contribute to understanding of the phenotypic differences between bcg mexico  <dig> and other bcg strains.

our snp analysis indicated the presence of  <dig> snps in bcg mexico  <dig> compared to bcg pasteur and  <dig> snps in bcg mexico  <dig> compared to bcg tokyo. among these snps, at least  <dig> have been reported in two previous studies  <cit> . additionally, in agreement with the snp-based phylogeny constructed by garcía pelayo et al., bcg mexico  <dig> was grouped with bcg tice in our analysis  <cit> .

we found a total of  <dig> snps representing nonsynonymous mutations , leading to amino acid substitutions . four snps in this group were specific to bcg mexico  <dig> . on the basis of functional classes, the genes containing nssnps encoded hypothetical proteins , proteins involved in intermediary metabolism and respiration , proteins related to lipid metabolism  and pe/ppe family proteins  .

1locations and names of affected genes follow bcg mexico 1931; bold text indicates previously reported snps.

we found snps within bcg0510c , bcg <dig> , bcg0692c , bcg0484c  and bcg <dig> . the snps in the last three genes have been described in previous studies  <cit> . the snp found in bcg0692c  causes an amino acid change with a concomitant loss of methoxymycolates in bcg strains obtained from the pasteur institute after  <dig>  <cit> . this result is consistent with the findings of hayashi et al., who described the absence of these acids in bcg mexico  <dig>  <cit> . an snp in the start codon of bcg0484c  is responsible for low expression of mpb <dig> and mpb <dig> in late bcg strains, including bcg mexico  <dig>  <cit> . moreover, mutations in bcg <dig>  a crp homologue global regulator, have been described as specific to bcg and are responsible for increased binding of crp to its target dna  <cit> . mutations in rv <dig>  and rv0470c  have been implicated in the virulence of m. tuberculosis. the pcaa gene encodes a mycolic acid cyclopropane synthetase and is important for growth, persistence in macrophages and proinflammatory activity  <cit> . additionally, regx <dig> is part of a two-component system regulated by pi  that is involved in the virulence of m. tuberculosis  <cit> .

interestingly, a specific nssnp from bcg mexico  <dig> causes an amino acid change in bcg <dig> . mutations in this gene have been associated with increased sensitivity to heat shock  and exposure to h2o <dig> compared to wild-type m. tuberculosis. additionally, a pona <dig> mutant was found to exhibit lower survival in mice compared to wild-type m. tuberculosis  <cit> .

we also identified six snps in pe_pgrs <dig>  ppe <dig>  pe_pgrs <dig>  ppe <dig> and pe_pgrs43b . these genes encode pe/ppe family proteins, which may play a role in the evasion of host immune responses, possibly via antigenic variation of mycobacteria  <cit> . in previous studies, it has been shown that the ppe <dig> protein elicits b cell responses, while ppe <dig> is required for mycobacterial growth in vitro  <cit> . furthermore, we determined that pe_pgrs <dig>  and ppe_pgrs <dig>  correspond to a longer product in bcg mexico compared with homologous sequences only for bcg tokyo . these results are consistent with data previously described  <cit> . importantly, the functional implications of these size variations remain unknown.

comparison of bcg proteomes
the protein contents of the cell fractions from four bcg substrains were analysed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  using bacteria in mid-logarithmic phase. a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> spots were visualised for bcg mexico  <dig>  bcg danish, bcg phipps and bcg tokyo, respectively , with high reproducibility and low variation between duplicate experiments . a comparative analysis of the proteomes of these bcg strains revealed  <dig> spots common to all strains and  <dig> that were unique to bcg mexico  <dig>  additionally, this analysis showed higher percentages of spots in common between bcg mexico  <dig> and bcg danish  or bcg phipps  than between bcg mexico  <dig> and bcg tokyo  .

previous studies have shown that bcg strains  differ in their protein profiles  <cit> . here, we observed that late strains  had a greater number of proteins in common compared to the early strain we studied . this difference can be explained by mutations in transcriptional regulators such as bcg <dig>  and bcg0484c  in late bcgs. furthermore, the proteins unique to bcg mexico  <dig> may be useful for characterising this strain and explaining the causes of the observed phenotypic differences compared to other bcg strains.

characterisation of the immune response by immune blotting
to identify immunogenic proteins in bcg mexico  <dig>  we performed an immune blotting analysis. we detected  <dig> reactive spots in the immune proteome . the largest numbers of reactive spots were obtained when using serum from subjects with active tb  or positive tuberculin skin test results  ;  <dig> of these spots were unique to each serum type . this result indicates high variability in the proteins recognised by each type of serum. we identified  <dig> proteins by sequencing , the majority of which  corresponded to intermediary metabolism and respiration proteins . among the identified proteins, some have been previously described as virulence proteins in different strains of m. tuberculosis: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase , isocitrate lyase , 3-oxoacyl synthase ii , groel, tb <dig> , the 85a and 85c antigens, alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase  and heat shock protein hspx  <cit> . rodriguez-alvarez et al. have reported that groel and ahpc are over-expressed in bcg phipps  <cit> . to our knowledge, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, isocitrate lyase, 3-oxoacyl synthase ii and ahpc are described as antigenic proteins for the first time in this report.

CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first genomic and proteomic characterisation of bcg mexico  <dig>  this substrain was used for bcg vaccine production in mexico until  <dig> and can now be used again for vaccine production and as a vector for the design of new second-generation vaccines against tuberculosis.

initially, we determined the rd profiles of three bcg substrains representing different stages of vaccine production in mexico. the rd profiles show that bcg mexico  <dig> is different from bcg mexico  <dig> and  <dig>  which have the same profile as bcg danish. these dates are consistent with historical records, which indicate that bcg vaccine was produced in mexico from the bcg danish strain after  <dig> 

based on these results, the bcg mexico  <dig> substrain was used for genomic and proteomic characterisation. according to the rd profiles and genome sequence of bcg mexico  <dig>  this substrain belongs to du <dig> group iv within the genealogy of bcg vaccines.

genetic studies of bcg substrains have provided new knowledge about the genes involved in the phenotypic differences observed for these strains , making it possible to elucidate the basis of phenotypic variation between them. the results of this investigation and previously published studies show that the genes with the largest numbers of mutations are related to two-component systems and transport , regulatory proteins  and lipid metabolism . interestingly, most of these mutations may be involved in the phenotypic differences observed between bcg substrains. for example, the lack of production of some membrane lipids  in bcg moreau is caused by deletions in bcg <dig>  and bcg <dig>   <cit> . in this study, we identified specific regions in bcg mexico  <dig> that may be directly involved in the phenotypic characteristics of this strain and designated them rdmex <dig> and rdmex <dig>  these regions affect the proteins fadd <dig> and whib <dig>  which are related to the interaction between the bacteria and macrophages. in addition, we have identified snps in genes previously determined to be involved in the virulence of mycobacterium strains. further studies are needed to establish the contributions of these mutations and to assess the roles of the newly identified antigenic proteins in the bcg mexico  <dig> phenotype.
