BACKGROUND
many genomes have been sequenced using the whole-genome shotgun method, in which the sequence assembly is prepared from short, unmapped sequence reads with the help of specific software. the presence of interspersed repeats and segmental duplications in eukaryotic genomes poses serious challenges to genome assembly. the end sequencing of genomic bac clones , as well as marker order data provided by linkage and/or radiation hybrid maps, has been used to guide assembly work and discriminate alternative assembly hypotheses. a correct assembly, indeed, has important implications in understanding genome organization and evolution, deciphering long-distance gene regulation, avoiding misinterpretation of polymorphisms, identifying pathologies directly or indirectly linked to features of genome architecture, and interpreting the 3d reconstruction of interphase nuclei  <cit> .

the sequence assembly of the cow  genome , similar to the genomes of rat and sea urchin  <cit> , was achieved by using an intermediate approach. a number of bacs were sequenced to aid and resolve assembly problems, with special consideration to uncertainties stemming from the occasional difference between the two haploid sets  <cit> . using the same pool of raw sequence data but different bioinformatics tools, zimin and colleagues  <cit>  published an alternative assembly of the cow genome . the two assemblies represent a paradigmatic example of how challenging it can be to create a sequence assembly based on whole-genome shotgun methods alone  <cit> .

we recently illustrated how molecular cytogenetics, using cohybridization fish experiments of bac clones , can discriminate between alternative hypotheses of synteny arrangements, orientation, and adjacencies  <cit> . the power of the bac-fish technique is based on the fact that it is assembly independent. we have recently emended, with this approach, misassembled segments up to  <dig> mbp in size in the macaque genome  <cit> . in this paper we use the same approach and, occasionally, long-range pcr to resolve mapping discrepancies of the two cow genome assemblies.

RESULTS
the cow sequence assembly released by liu et al.  <cit>  , also available on the major genome browsers since  <dig>  was recently updated to the nearly identical btau_ <dig>  release . the alternative assembly published by zimin et al.  was also refined. the last one, umd <dig>  draft  is the version we used in the present study. only recently it was included in ucsc and ensembl browsers.

the main difference between the btau and umd assemblies was a substantially larger amount of unassigned sequences  present in btau  compared to umd .

bioinformatics identification of btau/umd inconsistencies
the btau and umd masked sequences of each bos taurus chromosome were first compared using the genalyzer software  <cit> . the graphic output allows to easily identify the following inconsistencies in dna segments:  almost coincidental chromosomal mapping but discordant orientation ;  mapping in distinct positions  along the chromosome; and  present only in one chromosome but absent in the corresponding chromosome of the other assembly . for easy identification of inconsistent sequence assembly, we assigned to these sequences a code composed of the category they belong to followed by the chromosome number and the sequence position .

inconsistencies larger than  <dig> kbp revealed by the bioinformatics analyses are reported in the additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  shorter segments were not considered in the present study. the largest block was an inversion spanning  <dig>  mbp on btau . the vast majority of the inconsistencies were represented by the odss.

in summary, we found  <dig> invs ,  <dig> mdps , and  <dig> odss .  <dig> odss were found in umd  while only  <dig> in the btau assembly . these are listed in the additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the much lower number of btau odss with respect to umd odss was expected because of the consistently larger amount of chruns in the btau assembly.

all odss were aligned to the remaining chromosomes and unassigned scaffolds of the other assembly using megablast  <cit>  or genalyzer. most of the umd odss  aligned only to btau chrun scaffolds . in just  <dig> cases the ods of one assembly pointed to an ods on the other assembly  . the paired odss were always flanked by non-matching dna stretches. it could be hypothesized that the flanking non-matching sequences could be responsible for the discordant chromosomal assignments. these paired odss were named discordant chromosome mapping sequences . each dcm code report the two involved chromosomes . the dcm_3- <dig> and dcm_12- <dig> sequences are noteworthy. they are single copy in umd, mapping on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. btau reports a duplicate, second location for both of them, on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

some discordant segments were almost completely composed of gaps and/or repeats. these are listed in additional files  <dig>  and  <dig>  but were not considered in the study.

selection of bacs mapping in btau/umd discordant regions
because of the size of the bac clones, we took into account only mdp and dcm inconsistencies larger than  <dig> kbp . in the case of invs, only segments larger than  <dig> kbp were considered , because, in order to disentangle inv cases, we needed three distinct non-overlapping bacs: one mapping inside the segment and the other two mapping outside but close to the opposite borders. the  <dig> inconsistencies tested by fish are reported in table  <dig> . the bac search provided appropriate probes for  <dig> invs and  <dig> mdps  and  <dig> dcms .

inv, mdp, or dcm inconsistencies  disambiguated using the method reported in the second column: fish on interphase nuclei , fish on metaphases , or pcr. the third column indicates the draft  which is in agreement with the experimental results. in the case of fish performed in interphase nuclei, the round bracket reports the percentage in which the pattern of signals support the draft reported on the left of the brackets. in all cases p was <  <dig> %.

all umd chruns were less than  <dig> kbp in size and were not taken into account. for the btau chruns, appropriate bac clones were searched and identified for the  <dig> largest chruns , reported in additional file  <dig>  to simplify the reporting of these bacs in other tables and figures, we assigned a code to each bac . most of these bacs were entirely or almost entirely mapped in umd to a single locus. for these segments we successfully searched a single bac mapping within the scaffold . in some cases, different portions of the same scaffold mapped to distinct loci. in these cases we searched for two distinct appropriate bacs. the search was successful for scaffolds  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  . portions of the btau unassigned scaffolds  <dig>  and  <dig>  mapped to multiple sites of umd chromosomes .

all cow autosomes are acrocentric and difficult to distinguish on the basis of dapi banding. therefore, we assembled a panel of chromosome-specific bacs, one for each autosome and one for chromosome Ã— , mapping in btau/umd highly concordant regions, to be used as a reference . each yielded a fish signal consistent with its sequence position along the chromosome.

results of fish experiments
the bac-fish approach comes with a caveat: sequences shorter than 5- <dig> kbp are not visualized by fish. as a consequence, small deletions and duplications can be missed. additionally, although the cell line used in this study  belongs to the same hereford cattle breed of dominette , inter-individual differences in copy number variation can bias data comparisons. it is also worth noting that the bac library rp <dig> was derived from a bull of a different strain . however, array-cgh experiments, performed to compare dominette and ag <dig>  showed only two small variations  internal to two of the bacs used to disambiguate inconsistencies. as a consequence, this bias should not affect our results .

the consistency between the fish signal position of a bac clone with respect to the location of its sequence on the chromosome assembly was assessed by visual inspection . in all cases the fish signals were either perfectly compatible with the bioinformatics data or completely discordant .

inv inconsistencies
inversions are the largest discrepancies between btau and umd assembled chromosomes . fish experiments were able to disambiguate all  <dig> invs for which appropriate bacs were identified. in all these inv cases the results were in agreement with the umd assembly . figure 1b shows the fish results on the largest inversion, about  <dig> mbp in size, present on chr <dig> 

mdp inconsistencies
appropriate bac clones were identified for two mdps . the fish results supported umd in the case of mdp_5_ <dig>  and btau in the second case. the mapping position distances of the other mdps were too small to be disambiguated by fish. the disambiguation of two additional mdps  was then achieved using pcr experiments. in both cases the pcr experiments clearly supported the umd assembly . the same pcr approach was attempted to disambiguate the mdp_7_ <dig>  mapping, but all primer combinations gave negative results, thus suggesting that both assemblies could be incorrect. primers used in pcr experiments are listed in additional file  <dig> 

btau chrun/umd ods inconsistencies
as mentioned, we sampled the  <dig> largest btau chruns. we first tested using fish the  <dig> btau chruns mapped entirely to a single locus in umd . each bac was cohybridized with the appropriate reference bac for chromosome identification . the fish experiments perfectly matched the umd mapping data  in all cases except chruns  <dig>  and  <dig> . the  <dig>  scaffold was found to map to a single locus close to the centromere on chr <dig> in umd . the related bac ch20-439m <dig> yielded a major signal on the pericentromeric region of chr <dig> in agreement with the umd data but also yielded tiny signals on several other pericentromeric regions . pericentromeric regions are well known to harbor segmental duplications frequently shared with other pericentromeric regions  <cit> .

bacs mapping within the  <dig> largest btau chruns were hybridized in metaphase nuclei. cases where the bioinformatic and biological position were discordant are in bold.

the btau chrun  <dig>  mapped to umd chr <dig> . contrary to this mapping, the related bac ch240-0025k <dig>  gave a signal on the subtelomeric region of chr <dig> .

we then performed fish experiments to clarify the mapping of btau chruns that umd assigned to two or more loci . scaffolds  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  split into two domains mapping to different chromosomes  in umd; chrun  <dig>  split into two distinct regions of chrx . fish experiments using bacs specific for each domain were in perfect agreement with the umd mapping . a large part of btau unassigned scaffold  <dig>  was mapped to chr <dig>  with the exception of two distinct  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp dna stretches that umd duplicated to chr <dig> and chr <dig>  respectively . these duplications were not detected by fish, suggesting that the duplications could be assembly mistakes. genalyzer analysis unveiled a more complex situation for the two btau unassigned scaffolds  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the 5' portion of the chrun  <dig>   mapped to the subtelomeric region of chr <dig>  the rest of it was composed of sequence stretches duplicated to six distinct umd subtelomeric regions . our in silico bac screening identified two clones: u35a and u35b. the first bac confirmed the unequivocal mapping of the 5' sequence stretch of chrun  <dig>  to chr <dig> . the second bac, in addition to the six subtelomeric positions predicted in umd, disclosed six additional subtelomeric signals . low-copy repeats scattered over pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions are a frequent finding in mammals  <cit> . the complex mapping of the chrun  <dig>  in umd is summarized in figure 5d. the bac u39a, covering the region that umd unequivocally mapped to chr <dig> , clearly indicated that instead this domain maps to chr <dig> . the bac u39b, covering the region scattered to seven different loci in umd assembly , produced fish signals on the pericentromeric region of at least  <dig> chromosomes . for the remaining eight btau umd chruns, which mapped to multiple loci, blast analysis identified only a single bac . fish experiments were in agreement with umd data on the region spanned by the bac. the only exception was u <dig>  one bes of this bac was mapped to xq with the second to xp . the fish experiment yielded signals only on xq .

finally, we performed fish experiments, using the appropriate bacs, to map the two unassigned btau scaffolds,  <dig>  and  <dig> , that were not mapped in umd . the fish results mapped both of these scaffolds to the chr <dig> subtelomeric region.

these overall results indicate that btau_ <dig>  occasionally failed to incorporate multiple copies of a unique sequence into the assembly likely due to problems posed by the complexity of some regions --pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions in particular-- and that umd  <dig>  collapsed duplications into a single copy. ch240_439m <dig>  is an example of the latter situation, suggesting duplications may be over-collapsed in umd <dig>  differences due to copy number variations were considered in this context .

btau ods pointing to umd ods 
we disambiguated the nine dcm segments , which were larger than  <dig> kbp . the fish experiments, using appropriate bacs , were in agreement with umd in seven out of nine cases . in the dcm_27- <dig> case the fish analysis was in agreement with btau; the dcm_3- <dig> case, however, was peculiar. the latter sequence was mapped to chr <dig> in both btau and umd . a duplicated copy of this sequence is present on chr <dig> in btau . this latter btau mapping was the only one supported by the specific bac clone . no hints of a fish signal were observed on chr <dig> 

chromosome x
chrx is the chromosome showing the largest difference between the two assemblies, with strikingly fewer assembled sequences in btau than umd . it was not a surprise, therefore, that  <dig> out of the  <dig> btau chruns we tested  were mapped in umd to chrx . in all cases the fish results and umd were in perfect agreement.

van laere and colleagues  <cit>  recently characterized the bos taurus x/y pseudoautosomal region. umd places the btau chruns  <dig>  and  <dig>  internal to the pseudoautosomal region as defined by van laere et al.  <cit> . in agreement with these data, the two bacs ch240_376e <dig>  and ch240_0032o <dig>  yielded telomeric fish signals in both xp and y chromosomes . these data will be helpful to researchers in defining the organization of chry, which is poorly represented in both btau and umd.

CONCLUSIONS
the presence, in eukaryotes, of various types of repeats and segmental duplications makes the assembly of their genome sequences challenging, especially if attained using a shotgun approach. indeed, our bioinformatics comparison detected more than  <dig> instances in which dna segments larger than  <dig> kbp were mapped inconsistently in the two drafts or assembled only by one of the two assemblies. in this paper we sampled a number of segments whose mapping was at variance in the two bos taurus drafts. by hybridizing appropriate bac clones on cow metaphase or interphase nuclei, we were able to disambiguate most of the tested inconsistencies. in the majority of cases our fish results supported umd. additionally, we assigned some unassembled or partially misassembled sequences in both drafts to specific chromosomal regions .

we took into consideration only discrepancies between the two drafts. what about segments concordantly misassembled? the case of dcm_3- <dig> is paradigmatic in this respect. both drafts mapped it to chr <dig>  btau, however, placed a duplicated copy of this segment on chr <dig>  our fish analysis indicated that the sequence was uniquely located on the latter chromosome. if the duplication on chr <dig> was not present in btau, we would have missed this point. we can reasonably suppose, however, that the assembly of this segment was problematic, thus providing a paradigmatic example of how assembly work can take advantage of the fish approach.

a systematic bioinformatics/cytogenetics interaction guided the sequence assembly of the orangutan genome  <cit>  which, therefore, represents a relevant example in this context. hundreds of appropriate bac-fish experiments on orangutan metaphases produced detailed synteny maps of this genome. a graphic summary of this frame is reported at http://www.biologia.uniba.it/orang/ as an integral part of the orangutan sequencing project. a subset of the reported fish experiments was specifically designed to disambiguate alternative assembly hypotheses.

data on the karyotype evolution of the species under study, if available, may also be of help during the assembly. the orangutan chromosome  <dig> is a good example in this respect. the precise information on the distinct pericentric inversions this chromosome underwent in orangutan and human lineages since their divergence was crucial in precisely defining the orientation of the different synteny blocks in orangutan and allowed reconciling the very different organization of the chromosome in the two species .

as far as the cattle genome is concerned, the majority of our fish results performed to disambiguate btau/umd inconsistencies supported umd. this means that for a btau/umd discrepancy not disambiguated here, umd has a better chance to be the correct form, but the assumption has to be biologically validated to avoid biased conclusions.

some recent papers dealing with cattle genomics took into account the btau assembly only. their conclusions, therefore, could be biased. for example, kommadath and colleagues  <cit>  considered the region chr15: <dig>  162- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> as a single, continuous cluster of lowly expressed genes. on the contrary, umd mapped part of it  on chrx . our fish experiment was in perfect agreement with umd .

misassemblies can be very deceitful in genome-wide association studies. bouwman et al.  <cit> , for instance, used this approach to investigate the cattle genetic variation in milk fat composition primarily using the btau data set. they used the umd data just in case the segment was not assembled in btau. our bioinformatics analysis found that three of the reported regions  were partly inconsistent between btau and umd . these regions were not among those tested by fish in this study. therefore, as stressed above, a biological validation of their mapping is mandatory before any conclusion is drawn. in another genome-wide association study, cole et al.  <cit>  mapped their significant snps in both assemblies. in some cases the mapping discrepancy was very clear because two different chromosomes were involved . for the remaining snps it is not always apparent to the reader if the discrepancy affected the results or not. to conclude, all these studies make evident that a merge of the two assemblies into a single, agreed release of the cattle genome sequence is highly desirable, with cytogenetics playing an important role toward this goal.
