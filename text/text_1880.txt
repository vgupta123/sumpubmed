BACKGROUND
infectious laryngotracheitis virus  is the only member of the iltovirus genus of the alphaherpesvirinae subfamily of the herpesviridae family. iltv includes ~ <dig> kb of linear dsdna genome consisting of two unique regions , inverted repeats  and terminal repeats  flanking the us region  <cit> . about  <dig> open reading frames  have been shown to express viral proteins in iltv  <cit> . the genome structure and gene contents of the iltv genome clearly prove its classification as an alphaherpesvirus  <cit> . infection of iltv causes an upper respiratory disease in chickens during lytic infection, and iltv can establish latency in the central nervous system. respiratory symptoms of iltv infection include dramatically increased mucus formation in the trachea and tracheal hemorrhage that can cause up to 70% mortality. currently, live attenuated vaccines developed from chicken embryo or cultured cells are commercially available to control iltv disease  <cit> . however, vaccinal laryngtracheitis , resulting from reversion of vaccine virus to virulent form and spreading from vaccinated- to unvaccinated birds, is often associated with the use of live attenuated iltv vaccines  <cit> .

microarray methodology was developed as an epochal method to simultaneously analyze enormous data sets for gene expression patterns in various biological conditions  <cit> . microarrays have been used to investigate host responses to the infection of various viruses such as epstein-barr virus   <cit> , varicella-zoster virus   <cit> , human cytomegalovirus   <cit> , marek's disease virus   <cit> , herpesvirus of turkey  <cit> , herpes simplex virus- <dig>   <cit> , hepatitis virus  <cit> , human immunodeficiency virus   <cit>  and coxsackieviruses  <cit> .

microarray data sets can be interpreted further by clustering analysis. many of the heuristic clustering methods have several shortcomings; these include the determination of the number of clusters which generally is unknown when there is no prior knowledge of the number or there no other information about the structure of the data to be clustered. a model-based clustering method can overcome these critical drawbacks by treating a clustering problem as a model selection problem over a variety of candidate models specified by different numbers of clusters and distribution, and by estimating the number of clusters in the clustering analysis. the best model is selected on the basis of a model selection criterion, simultaneously providing the optimal number of clusters and assigning cluster membership to observations.

to our knowledge, the effects of iltv infection on changes in global gene expression in host cells have not been previously reported. iltv is a special type of herpesvirus that causes acute respiratory disease in poultry. thus, the objective of this study was to understand host responses to iltv infection in cultured chicken embryo lung cells using microarray analysis. the microarray used in the current study contains  <dig> k chicken genes including functionally identified genes, predicted orfs, ests, genomic contigs, chicken micrornas and various control spots  <cit> . importantly, functional analysis of differentially expressed genes should follow gene discovery research. to this end, a software program , specifically developed to analyze large data sets such as microarray data for biological functionalities, gene networks, and physiological pathways  <cit> , was used to assign biological functionalities and molecular interactions in chicken embryo lung cells after  <dig> to  <dig> days in response to iltv infection.

RESULTS
gene expression profile of lung cells infected by iltv
primary chicken embryo lung cells at passage  <dig> were infected by the usda reference strain of iltv and cells were collected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpi. cytopathic effects  were observed by  <dig> dpi, which became more severe by  <dig> dpi. massive cell disruption was observed at  <dig> dpi . total rna was isolated from both controls and infected lung cells at each dpi time point and subjected to microarray analysis.

to control for dye bias effects, spike-in control mixtures were utilized by mixing with rna samples according to the manufacturer's recommendations . the spike-in rna controls consisted of two sets of synthetic rna mixtures derived from the adenovirus e1a genes with different concentrations in each set  <cit> . the agilent chicken  <dig> ×  <dig> k oligo gene expression array contains  <dig> spike-in indicator spots to be hybridized with spike-in controls of both a mix, which was hybridized with cy  <dig>  and the b mix hybridized with cy  <dig> on each array. these spike-in sets were mixed with either uninfected control or infected samples and co-hybridized to arrays. the ratio of signal intensities for all spike-in spots were calculated, evaluated, and revealed no significant dye effects on all array slides  as reported previously  <cit> . all raw and normalized data were deposited in the gene expression omnibus .

normalized signal intensities were subjected to statistical analysis to find differentially expressed genes during iltv infection in cultured embryonic lung cells. the  <dig> k array revealed  <dig>  genes with significant signal intensities that were sorted by signal to noise ratio  > <dig>  meaning that real  signals of the samples were three times greater than background signals. in order to discover time course change in gene expression patterns, a model-based method  <cit>  was used for clustering the gene expression profiles. a key drawback in heuristic clustering techniques is that it is difficult to determine the number of clusters a priori. the method enables the number of clusters to be determined by estimating the number of components in a multivariate normal mixture model from which the data are generated. the clustering analysis resulted in three gene groups . group  <dig> included a total of  <dig> genes that showed significant differential expression in response to iltv, group  <dig> included  <dig>  genes that displayed moderate alterations, and group  <dig> included  <dig>  genes that revealed no alterations during iltv infection at four time points in chicken lung cells. of the  <dig> genes in group  <dig> exhibiting differential expression in response to iltv , the top 10%  were sorted by statistical analysis based on the highest value of standard deviations using the mean values of four different time points . this approach highlights genes with more significant alterations in response to iltv overtime. out of the  <dig> genes,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were down-regulated, while  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were up-regulated relative to uninfected cells at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpi, respectively.

the highly differentially expressed genes were sorted. all genes were matched and verified with unigene function of ncbi database.

quantitative reverse transcription-pcr 
to validate the microarray data,  <dig> genes were subjected to qrt-pcr using gene specific primer pairs and the same rna samples as in the microarray analysis . results were analyzed by 2-∆∆ct method to determine relative levels of gene expression at each dpi time point compared to uninfected control  <cit> . there were no differences between microarray data and the qrt-pcr at any dpi time point . however, it should be noted that fold change values for certain genes obtained by qrt-pcr analysis showed much greater expression levels than those observed in the microarray analysis. for example, the fold changes for the gene expression of matrix metalloproteinase   <dig>  interleukin   <dig>  fatty acid binding protein   <dig>  il <dig>  and cxc chemokine k <dig> at 3- or  <dig> dpi showed much higher levels in qrt-pcr analysis compared to fold changes shown in microarray analysis . possibly, this qualitative difference between methodologies may be attributed to the upper detection limits of the fluorescent intensities for the array scanner. based on quality control measures, such as the spike-in controls and the results of targeted qrt-pcr indicate that the microarray data sets for differential gene expression are valid to investigate genome-wide differential expression patterns for host responses during iltv infection.

the first column indicates the ncbi accession number for designated genes, and the second column shows sequences for the forward and reverse primers. the gene symbols are provided in the third column.

the gene expression levels of  <dig> genes at four different time points in microarray analysis were confirmed by qrt-pcr. the expression levels were presented by fold changes values in microarray analysis, while, for qrt-pcr, the values were calculated by 2-ΔΔct method  <cit> , which would be comparable to fold changes in the microarray. all values are mean values determined by the calculation from three replicating assays.

expression clustering
the pattern of differential gene expression over time can provide insights into biologically functional relevance among genes. in the present study, a model-based clustering method  <cit>  was used to cluster alteration patterns for the  <dig> differentially expressed genes in response to iltv infection and revealed  <dig> gene clusters exhibiting distinct expression patterns . the  <dig> genes placed in cluster   <dig> showed only nominal increases at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi followed by decreased expression levels at  <dig> dpi that were similar to those at the onset of the experiment. the c <dig> representing  <dig> genes exhibited a dramatic increase in gene expression only at  <dig> dpi, whereas the expression levels of the  <dig> genes in c <dig> progressively declined at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. three genes in c <dig> showed higher expression during early infection , sharp increases at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, followed by a slight decline at  <dig> dpi. expression patterns of  <dig> genes in c <dig> showed slightly lower expression at  <dig> dpi relative to the other time points, a dramatically increase at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, followed by decreased expression at  <dig> dpi. the  <dig> genes in c <dig> showed lower expression at  <dig> dpi followed by a progressive increase during the later time points, which was opposite to  <dig> genes in c <dig> that showed higher expression at  <dig> dpi followed by decreased expression at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpi. genbank accession numbers for genes in each cluster are shown in the additional file  <dig> 

interestingly, the genes in c <dig> that exhibited the highest expression during iltv infection include cytokines  and a chemokine , while in the c <dig>  il <dig> was most highly expressed. from these findings, it is reasonable to hypothesize that expression of functionally relevant genes such as cytokines and chemokines released in response to an immune challenge may be regulated similarly during a specific immunological challenge.

functional gene ontology 
recently, new bioinformatics tools have been developed to facilitate efficient analysis of biological functionalities for large numbers of differentially expressed genes obtained from microarray analysis. by using the ipa program , bioinformatics aspects of differentially expressed genes during iltv infection were analyzed for the relevance of gene functionalities and gene networks. while  <dig> differentially expressed genes were used as the input number of genes, only  <dig> have been characterized with specific cellular functions according to the ipa program. results obtained with the ipa program in terms of numbers of genes, biological functions of genes and categories were independently confirmed with a second bioinformatics tool, david  version  <dig>   . the group of  <dig> differentially expressed genes was placed into  <dig> functional groups  and the top  <dig> functional groups of genes are displayed in figure  <dig>  the main categories for gene functionalities include diseases and disorders, molecular and cellular functions, and physiological system development. gene information was repeatedly used in multiple groups of functionalities due to the multi-functional characteristics for designated genes. it can be seen that the cancer related function contains the highest number  of genes, while  <dig> genes were involved in genetic disorders, and  <dig> genes were grouped as inflammatory responses.

gene network analysis
gene network analysis, which represents the intermolecular connections among interacting genes based on functional knowledge inputs, was performed on the differentially expressed genes using ipa program . in this way,  <dig> possible gene networks for all days post iltv infection were generated based on differential gene expression. of these  <dig> gene networks, only  <dig> gene networks were identical at all time points following iltv infection. possibly, the reason why only  <dig> of  <dig> networks were identical might be because of differences in the sets of focus molecules which are generated from p-values and fold change values of differential gene expression that are used in ipa algorithms. the dynamics of alterations in gene expression for a subset of genes during the time course of iltv infection can provide insights into biologically interacting genes within a network that display functional similarities. the most interactive network  is presented in figure  <dig> whereas the other networks are shown in additional file  <dig> 

network # <dig> is closely associated with a signaling pathway of il <dig>  which is a cytokine known to be involved in cell proliferation and inflammatory responses  <cit> . the top functions related with genes in network # <dig> involve cancer, gastrointestinal disease, and the cell cycle. interestingly, expression of certain genes in network # <dig> such as cdc <dig> , pttg <dig> , cdc <dig>  and cyclin b, which are associated with cellular proliferation in cell cycle progression, appeared to be inversely related to il <dig> expression. the dynamics of alterations in gene expression over time during iltv infection suggest that iltv infection elevates il <dig> expression followed by the inhibition of cellular proliferation. in contrast, expression patterns of hpgd , socs , jak , and nasp  were independent of the il <dig> expression pattern . jak is known to enhance cellular proliferation through the signal transducer and activator of transcription  pathway that can be suppressed by il <dig> signaling  <cit> . the consistent downregulation of jak supports a role of jak in the repression of cellular proliferation by iltv infection. the top functions of genes in network # <dig> are involved with cellular compromise, connective tissue disorders, and post-translational modifications. several heat shock proteins  were also focused in this network . heat shock proteins, especially the hsp <dig> family that serve as molecular chaperones, are known to interact with viral early immediate genes in hsv- <dig> genomic dna replication  <cit> . interestingly, since the expression of several hsps in network # <dig> were downregulated, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the lower hsp through  <dig> dpi may lead to production of erroneous virion structures of iltv that in turn results in low iltv titers in tissue culture, which has been reported to barely exceed one infectious unit per cell  <cit> .

network # <dig> contains genes for growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases , and genes have top functions associated with endocrine system function and development, carbohydrate metabolism, and digestive system function and development . expression for growth factors and mmps increased on  <dig> dpi and remain elevated through  <dig> dpi. this observation is in agreement with other reports that infection with herpesviruses, such as hsv and hcmv, lead to an increase in growth factor expression and mmps for extracellular remodeling, tissue invasion and angiogenesis  <cit> . networks # <dig> and # <dig> contain cytokine genes , chemokine genes , and genes of the nf-kb families  with top functions that are involved in organism injury and abnormalities, antigen presentation, cell mediated immune responses, lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, and molecular transport . finally, genes in network # <dig> contain il <dig>  nf-kb, and id <dig> that function in cardiac inflammation, cardiovascular disease and in the inflammatory response . interacting molecules found in networks # <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are mostly focused on the host immune responses against pathogenic infections.

the network analysis suggests that a large number of biological pathways, regulated by various sets of genes, closely interact with each other in host responsiveness during iltv infection. more detailed interactions among genes showing altered expression levels in each network are currently under investigation to identify host-response mechanisms that may occur in conjunction with general immunological reactions during iltv infections.

the fold changes in gene expression of key molecules associated with cellular immune response, cell signaling, mmp molecules, cytokines, chemokines, and cell proliferation were plotted individually . this was done since the molecules may help in clarifying the interaction of host lung cells with iltv. four matrix metalloproteinases  including mmp  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were differentially expressed during iltv infections. for example, mmp  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were shown to function in cell invasions of primary human endothelial cell in kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus  pathogenesis  <cit> . similarly the viral oncoprotein meq in mdv is known to activate mmp <dig> transcription  <cit> . furthermore, the balance between mmp <dig> and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases  <dig>  was altered in human macrophages in hcmv infection, such that mmp <dig> activity declined in response to hcmv infection. moreover, it was shown that hcmv infection may affect atherogenesis in mice through the control of mmp <dig> expression  <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that mmps generally play a role in herpesvirus pathogenesis, but different isoforms of mmps may be capable of responding to specific herpesviruses. furthermore, in the present study with chicken lung cells, expression of surfactant protein a  was downregulated by iltv infection. since the sftpa- <dig> is a transcriptional indicator of egfr  signaling pathway  <cit> , the reduction in sftpa- <dig> expression suggests that the egfr signaling pathway is suppressed by iltv infection. this conclusion is consistent with the reported downregulation of egfr functions in hcmv infected human lung  <cit>  and foreskin fibroblastic cells  <cit> . additionally, our findings are similar to a report in which the mrna expression of sftpa- <dig> declined after inoculation of influenza a virus h9n <dig> into chicken lung cells  <cit> .

another molecule, ovotransferrin  has both iron transport- and antibacterial-activities. in the present study, the expression level of otrf increased in iltv infected cells . the finding is qualitatively similar to a possible role of otrf in mdv infection that might protect the spread of mdv in chicken embryonic fibroblast cells  <cit> . otrf also was found to accelerate the expression of immune response gene such as ifn-γ against mdv infection  <cit> . furthermore, lactoferrin, which is a homologous form of transferrin in mammals, showed antiviral activity against canine herpesvirus  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that the anti-viral activity of otrf may be similar to the anti-hsv capability of mammalian transferrins  <cit> . il <dig> plays a role in both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses  <cit> . the elevation of il <dig> expression during virus infection has been well-characterized as one of the immune response activities in the pathogenesis of various viruses, such as dengue virus in human  <cit> , or hsv- <dig> in mice  <cit> . also, the expression of il <dig> is increased by khsv-encoding mirna  <cit> . similarly, expression of il <dig> and il1β were upregulated in iltv infected cells and also in mdv infected chicken lung  <cit> . these observations are consistent with previous findings of nf-kb activation via il <dig> signaling pathway by human herpesvirus - <dig> infection  <cit>  and hhv- <dig> infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures  <cit> , respectively.

in addition to the well-characterized host-virus interactions, a variety of unique responses detected with the microarray analysis of iltv infection in the present study. for instance, the expression level of vasoactive intestinal peptide  decreased dramatically in iltv infection, but the functional consequences were not determined. likewise, genes related to various metabolic enzyme functions such as acyl-coa synthetase long chain- <dig>  were differentially expressed in iltv infected cells, but the precise mechanisms in the host response have not been verified. therefore, further investigations are being performed to identify unique and more deeply involved interactions between host lung cells and iltv.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have demonstrated changes in global gene expression in response to iltv infection in chicken embryo lung cells using microarray analysis. a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes were involved in a variety of molecular and cellular defense mechanisms of immune response, cell cycle regulation, cellular metabolism, and matrix metalloprotenases. moreover, the bioinformatics studies, such as gene ontology and gene network analysis, using knowledge based bioinformatics tools  revealed biological functionalities and intermolecular connections among interacting genes associated with differentially expressed genes. our study provides epigenetic insights into the pathogenesis of iltv infection in chicken lung cells.
