BACKGROUND
stroke is the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and cancer, in the uk and the leading cause of adult disability  <cit> . few effective pharmacological treatments currently exist for acute ischaemic stroke. although tissue plasminogen activator is effective, its use is limited by its narrow treatment window  <cit> . thus, a main focus of stroke research is the development of novel neuroprotective strategies to reduce the progression of neuronal damage.

pre-clinical studies have shown progesterone to be neuroprotective following cerebral ischaemia  <cit> . however, these pre-clinical stroke studies have tended to administer it via repeated intraperitoneal  injections  <cit> . although, a couple of studies have administered progesterone subcutaneously via slow release pellets this has only been the case where treatment commenced prior to the onset of stroke  <cit> . continuous post-injury progesterone administration has been shown to produce enhanced benefit in traumatic brain injury  as compared to repeated injections in a rat model after neuronal damage  <cit> . whether this benefit of continued post-ischemic administration is also true in a model of stroke has not been demonstrated previously.

in addition, the majority of previously published studies investigating the potential protective effects of progesterone have focused on young, healthy adult animals. however, co-morbidities are common in patients with stroke and have been shown to be negatively correlated with functional outcome  <cit> . age is the single most important risk factor for stroke and the incidence of stroke increases with age  <cit> . another well recognised risk factor for stroke is hypertension and pre-existing hypertension may be present in more than half of stroke patients  <cit> . hypertension affects both small and large vessels supplying the brain  <cit> , and there is a strong association between hypertension and mortality following stroke  <cit> . the impact of these co-morbidities has not been fully investigated. therefore, further investigation is required to explore the neuroprotective effectiveness of progesterone in these co-morbid animals.

the aim of the current study was to evaluate if progesterone would be effective in conferring neuroprotection after the onset of experimental stroke when administered via osmotic mini-pump in adult mice. in a prior study from our laboratory, the pharmacokinetics of progesterone in mice using this dosing method were investigated, and found it to be effective in delivering progesterone to the target area of the brain  <cit> . the delivery of progesterone via osmotic mini-pumps in an experimental stroke model, induced via middle cerebral artery occlusion , has not been demonstrated previously; mini-pump delivery could offer a more suitable dosing method with the advantages of reducing peaks and troughs in drug levels, the stress associated with repeated injections, and diminishing levels of release over time as seen with pellet implants. infusion methods are commonly used clinically to maintain drug concentrations and osmotic mini-pump release of agents at a constant rate mimics this approach. in addition, we conducted some proof-of-principle experiments to determine if progesterone administration, via mini-pump or intraperitoneal administration, was effective in aged or hypertensive mice subjected to focal cerebral ischemia.

discussion
the current study shows that progesterone treatment, initiated following the onset of mcao and delivered continually is beneficial in terms of promoting functional recovery in young, adult healthy male mice. in the present study, our outcomes have focused on functional measures, as clinical trials of novel stroke therapies use functional measures as their primary end-point. in humans, the amount of structural damage resulting from the stroke does not always correlate well with functional impairment  <cit> . thus, it is important for pre-clinical studies to have functional measures relevant to stroke outcome in patients. a major goal for the treatment of stroke is for patients to be functionally independent and so pre-clinical studies need to reflect the importance of functional outcomes. restoration of behavioural function needs to be demonstrated in the pre-clinical evaluation of any putative stroke therapy and from the results reported here further longer-term assessments of recovery are warranted.

previous studies have reported the ability of progesterone to improve functional deficit following mcao using neurological deficit scales  <cit> . however, these studies have tended to use a much simpler neurological deficit scale which simply grades function by  <dig>  or  <dig>  levels ranging from ‘normal’ to ‘severely impaired’  <cit> . in the current study, we utilised a 28-point neurological deficit score, first developed by clark et al.  <cit> , which we believe is a more sensitive measure of neurological deficit. functional deficits, as measured by the foot-fault test, found progesterone treatment to be beneficial over time, by reducing the number of contralateral foot-faults in comparison to vehicle treatment. in the current study we chose a relative short occlusion time, in comparison to other studies  <cit> , in an attempt to maximize survival following mcao.

as well as affecting motor behaviours cerebral stroke also commonly disrupts cognitive processes. in rodents, cognitive processes can be assessed by a variety of tasks including the t-maze which is a test of spatial learning and working memory  <cit> . this behavioural test allows the detection of one-sided spatial neglect and enables both unchallenged locomotion and exploratory motivation to be observed  <cit> . it’s ability to detect differences in cognitive processing following ischemic stroke have been previously demonstrated  <cit> . for example, animals with ischaemic brain injury have a tendency to turn ipsilaterally towards the damaged side during the t-maze test and display behavioural asymmetry  <cit> . however, in the current study, thirty minutes of mcao did not appear to affect any of the outcome measures  associated with the t-maze in in healthy adult animals. however, in co-morbid animals where the effect of ischemia is exacerbated a deficit in t-maze performance was observed. however, future studies using an extended range of behavioural tests, for example to assess sensorimotor neglect, grip strength etc., are also warranted following progesterone treatment.

although a number of published studies have reported the protective effects of progesterone treatment for ischemic stroke very few report mortality data. one study reported progesterone treatment to increase survival after ischaemia  <cit> , while others have reported no effect  <cit> . in the present study, no difference in survival was found between treatment groups. in terms of welfare measures, body mass can be a useful indicator of general well-being and progesterone has been shown to reduce body mass loss in some studies  <cit> . however, in accordance with our study, some have reported that body mass loss, although significant following mcao, is unaffected by progesterone treatment  <cit> .

one aim of this study was to determine if sustained progesterone delivery was able to offer neuroprotection following cerebral ischemia as had been previously demonstrated for repeated administrations  <cit> . our previous pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that progesterone delivered via i.p. injection has a very short half-life in both plasma and brain  <cit>  but high progesterone concentrations in the brain can be achieved via mini pump infusion. there have only a few studies, involving progesterone and experimental stroke, which have reported infusion delivery in rats  <cit>  and mice  <cit> . however, both of these studies initiated progesterone treatment prior to the onset of mcao whereas in the current study progesterone treatment began following occlusion. the current study demonstrates this method of administration to be beneficial in terms of reducing neurological deficit and improving motor function. lack of protection in some outcome measures, but not others, may be due to either a dose effect or the length of initial occlusion. although, increasing the progesterone dose might not necessarily result in greater neuroprotection as some studies have used higher doses of progesterone  but found no greater beneficial effect  <cit> . chen et al. found 8 mg/kg but not 4 mg/kg or 32 mg/kg to be neuroprotective  <cit> , indicating a relatively narrow dose–response window. clearly it will be important to determine, in future experiments, whether there is a similar narrow therapeutic window when progesterone is delivered by loading dose and mini-pump infusion, avoiding the peaks and troughs in tissue concentrations produced by repeated injections.

a second purpose of this study was to conduct some proof-of-principle studies in co-morbid animals. in humans, age is a predictor of worse outcome following stroke and this investigation has also shown this to be true in aged animals. aged animals were very susceptible to mcao and the majority of aged animals were found dead or were killed for welfare reasons the following day after surgery. mortality is expected to be higher in older animals compared to younger ones and this has been shown in rats, where mortality immediately post-stroke was found to be low in young animals  but high in old rats   <cit> . in the current study, the majority of deaths were due to animals being killed for welfare reasons , rather than animals found dead. there was no difference in outcomes between treatment groups in aged animals, although this may be due to lack of statistical power from high mortality in aged animals. studies have not been previously performed in aged mice that are as old as the ones investigated here , which is a phase leaving middle to old age. middle age, in both mice and rats, is considered to be 10– <dig> months and old age is considered to be 18– <dig> months. a limited number of studies have investigated neuroprotection of progesterone in rodents at middle and old age, but most have initiated treatment prior to occlusion and found conflicting results. for example, toung et al. found female rats aged 14– <dig> months did not benefit from pre-mcao treatment with progesterone  <cit> , while alkayed et al. using 16 month old female rats found progesterone to be beneficial when administered prior to mcao  <cit> . in addition, gibson et al.  <cit>  used 12 month old female mice in which post-mcao treatment with progesterone was found to be protective in terms of reducing the lesion volume but didn’t improve neurological outcome. in aged  rats, administration of progesterone post-occlusion did improve both infarct damage and neurological function  <cit> . studies of progesterone and experimental stroke involving aged animals are limited, particularly for the dosing of animals after the start of occlusion.

in terms of co-morbidities hypertension is also an important risk factor for ischemic stroke and thought to be present in more than half of stroke patients  <cit> . there is a strong association between hypertension and mortality following stroke  <cit> , thus we conducted some preliminary experiments in hypertensive animals. as the outcome in hypertensive mice was expected to be worse we chose a protocol believed to reduce the impact on animal welfare which included a shorter duration time and a one-off intraperitoneal administration of progesterone. this is supported by the fact that hypertensive animsl did display a high percentage loss of body mass in comparison to other animal groups although only showed a relative low neurological deficit in response to the stroke. progesterone treatment in hypertensive animals was found to be beneficial in reducing neurological deficit, which concurs with work found in hypertensive rats  <cit> . although the foot-fault and t-maze tests did not show any significant difference following progesterone treatment in hypertensive mice progesterone treated animals had a preference to turn towards the contralateral side whereas the prediction would be that animals with ischaemic brain injury have a tendency to turn ipsilaterally towards the damaged side during t-maze and other tests of behavioural asymmetry  <cit> . care must be taken with these findings in hypertensive animals, as our comparison group did not receive vehicle. progesterone was dissolved in dmso, which has been shown to have neuroprotective properties  <cit> . hence, it cannot be confirmed on the level neuroprotection is attributed to progesterone or dmso and so further investigation is required to determine this. in addition, alternative mouse models of hypertension, e.g. rennin-dependent, may be worth investigating in comparison to the bph/ <dig> mice used here.

studies investigating the neuroprotective potential of drugs in adult healthy animals in experimental stroke do not represent the demographic of patients, which frequently have co-morbidities  <cit> . therefore, is important to utilise co-morbid animals in the research of experimental stroke. also, the presence of co-morbidities, might attenuate neuroprotective effects in some drugs, as seen with hypertension and the experimental neuroprotective agent nxy- <dig>  <cit> . in this current preliminary study, only the risk factors of age and hypertension were investigated but other significant risk factors of stroke that were not investigated here include; obesity  <cit> , diabetes  <cit>  and gender  <cit> , which are also overlooked in experimental stroke studies. also, this study has failed to take into account the combination of risk factors such as age and gender. it would be useful to consider, that whilst pre-menopausal females represent the population group with the lowest risk of stroke, post-menopausal females represent the group at higher risk  <cit> . therefore, further investigation is needed in aged female animals along with long-term functional/pathological assessment of outcome which will also permit the study of the effect of neuronal plasticity on recovery.

CONCLUSIONS
progesterone treatment, initiated post-ischemia, was effective on conferring functional improvement in healthy, adult mice. in addition, such protective effects were observed when delivery of progesterone was sustained thus negating the requirement for repeated injections which results in peaks and troughs of progesterone levels. any future clinical trials evaluating neuroprotection of progesterone in stroke would need to use a method of dosing that achieved a steady state concentration lasting several days, e.g. infusion or long-acting vaginal/rectal administration. aged animals have an increased sensitivity to mcao and did not display, in the outcomes measured here, any benefit from progesterone treatment. hypertensive bph/ <dig> mice are a potential hypertensive model and had better functional outcomes after treatment with intraperitoneally administered progesterone, compared to non-treated hypertensive animals.
