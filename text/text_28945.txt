BACKGROUND
metal extraction activities generate large amounts of contaminated materials. mining spoils are major sources of pollution as they disperse into the surrounding environment through aerial or water erosion and can be found several kilometers away from their original site of deposit. such sources of pollution pose significant risks to public health  <cit>  and to ecosystem dynamics due to reduced biodiversity resulting from low plant coverage caused by soil toxicity  <cit> . while remediation through chemical extraction destructs soils and is more expensive, phytoremediation strategies appear as more environment-friendly and constitute long term solutions to reduce metal toxicity in polluted sites. in highly polluted soils like mining soils, where the removal of metals by phytoextraction using hyperaccumulator plants is not efficient due to the slowness of the process, the best adapted method is phytostabilization  <cit> . this consists in limiting the dissemination of toxic metals by using metallicolous plants, i.e. metal tolerant plants, to establish a persistent plant cover and prevent pollution through erosion. such a phytostabilization approach is nevertheless challenging since it requires metallicolous plants able to grow in soils where nutrients are most often dramatically scarce. legume/rhizobia symbioses which transform atmospheric dinitrogen into organic nitrogen is of ecological interest here as it can improve natural soil fertility and thereby allow the colonization of other plant species and the installation of a plant cover  <cit> . however, survival and proliferation of organisms on metal contaminated sites depends on their capacity to tolerate high metal concentrations and requires the acquisition of resistance mechanisms.

a recent study conducted in a former mining area contaminated by zinc , cadmium  and lead , named “les malines mining district” in the south of france, allowed the description of  <dig> plant species, some of which may be used in phytoremediation projects  <cit> . among the plant species listed, a leguminous plant, anthyllis vulneraria, is of particular interest as it can enter in symbiosis with rhizobia. a metal tolerant symbiotic partner of a. vulneraria was recently characterized as a new species of mesorhizobium and named m. metallidurans <cit> . additionally, the anthyllis/mesorhizobium symbiosis has been identified in the mining site of eylie in the pyrenees . eylie’s mine soil presents a geochemical background similar to the avinières mine where m. metallidurans was found. it is highly polluted by zn, cd and pb  but displays higher organic carbon content  <cit>  than the avinières soil. mesorhizobium strains isolated from anthyllis are  capable of entering in symbiosis with metal-tolerant ecotypes of a. vulneraria and  tolerant to several metals including zn and cd ; therefore, they can be used in future phytostabilization strategies and constitute a good rhizobial model for studying the mechanisms they have evolved to tolerate high metal concentrations.

prokaryotes have developed several complex molecular mechanisms to deal with ionic homeostasis or metal toxics  <cit> . the most and best studied metal resistant model bacterium is cupriavidus metallidurans ch <dig>  which harbors in its genome an exceptionally high number of metal resistance mechanisms  <cit> . the major mechanisms bacteria use to counteract metal toxicity consist in  permeability barriers,  effluxes via pib-type atpases, resistant nodulation cell-division proteins , cation diffusion facilitor proteins  or major facilitor superfamily systems ,  intracellular and/or extracellular sequestration and  transformation of metals into a less toxic form by enzymatic detoxification  <cit> . efflux systems represent the largest category of metal-resistance systems  <cit> . in the model bacterium c. metallidurans, these mechanisms are in most cases not metal specific and under the control of a complex regulatory network involving several clusters of genes and functions  <cit> .

in order to identify genes or functions in an organism of interest, genome sequences can be produced and analyzed using comparative genomics tools. although genomic sequence data allow for the listing of putative gene contents in an organism, they do not provide any functional evidence. to go one step further, genome-wide transcriptional analyses allow for rapid identification of genes or loci that are transcriptionally active and associated with a particular physiological state. such transcriptomic studies can now be available for any organism at a relatively low cost using high-throughput sequencing techniques in rna sequencing  experiments.

in this paper, the main goals are to study gene expression profiles associated with zn or cd exposure and to identify genes involved in cd and zn tolerance in two symbiotic mesorhizobium isolates using comparative genomics and transcriptomics. two strains isolated from mining spoils of distinct geographical origins are compared: strain stm  <dig> was isolated from the avinières mine in the cévennes area  <cit>  and strain stm  <dig> was isolated from the eylie mine in the pyrénées ariégeoises . the draft genome sequences were produced using mate-pair  <dig> pyrosequencing and analyzed using an automated microbial genome annotation pipeline. rnaseq analyses were performed on bacteria exposed for half a generation time to mild zn or cd stresses which affect growth negatively but only to a low extent. using mild exposure allows for the detection of genes and mechanisms specifically induced in the response to metals while avoiding all stresses related to complex responses induced when submitting bacteria to high growth-inhibiting or lethal metal concentrations.

RESULTS
effect of zn and cd on mesorhizobium metallidurans stm 2683t and mesorhizobium sp. stm  <dig> growth
the effect of zn or cd addition to the ty growth medium was tested for the two metal-tolerant mesorhizobium strains  and for the metal-sensitive strains m. tianshanense  and mesorhizobium sp. stm  <dig> . strains stm  <dig> and stm  <dig> were able to grow in media containing higher concentrations of zn or cd when compared to sensitive strains . in ty medium, the closely related mesorhizobium strain stm  <dig> or m. tianshanense were not able to grow when zn or cd concentrations were raised to  <dig> mm or  <dig>  mm, respectively . aiming at characterizing genes responding to zn or cd exposure in our mesorhizobial strains, three rna libraries previously depleted in rrna for both sequenced strains were prepared. the experimental design included exposure to cd or zn at concentrations  that were high enough to affect mesorhizobia growth without being lethal . such conditions were chosen in order to ascertain bio-availability of the metals and to avoid general and unspecific stress responses which would lead in the deregulation of a large number of genes that are not directly linked to the metal response. furthermore, we used a short time exposure  to these metals in order to detect genes and functions involved in the early response to the metals studied.

genome sequencing, assembly and automated annotation
in order to identify the genetic bases of our two metal-tolerant mesorhizobia and to use them as references to map sequence reads from the transcriptome data sets, the draft genomes of the two studied strains were first sequenced using half a  <dig> run  with paired-end reads from an  <dig> kb genomic bank for each isolate. after the assembly, the comparison with m. huakuii maff  <dig> genome  led for both genomes to the identification and organization of  <dig> chromosomal  and  <dig> plasmidic  scaffolds. these genomes were integrated into the microscope platform  <cit>  to perform automatic and expert annotation of the genes, providing  <dig>  genomic objects for stm  <dig> and  <dig>  for stm  <dig>  genome sequences are also available from european nucleotide archive under accession numbers caum01000001-caum <dig> for strain stm  <dig> and caaf010000001-caaf <dig> for strain stm  <dig>  the general genome characteristics for the two analyzed strains are listed in table  <dig>  as expected, cds located on the plasmids were less conserved. we found that only 12% and 15% of cds located on plasmids of stm  <dig> and stm  <dig> respectively possessed at least one homolog in the other strain. despite the lower conservation observed for genes located on plasmids, we did not identify an over-representation of operons or genes that were associated with metals. such results suggest that plasmids harbor accessory genes which are not specialized in metal adaptation in the strains stm  <dig> and stm  <dig> contrary to the model c. metallidurans ch <dig> where most metal-responsive genes are plasmid-borne  <cit> .

in order to estimate genomic divergence between the two strains, we explored the proportions of homologous cds as a function of the identity percentage. homologous genes present in the two strains were retrieved with the comparative genomics phyloprofile tool in microscope. using an alignment threshold of 80% identity over at least 80% of the query sequence and target size, approximately  <dig>  homologous genes, present in both strains, were identified . these results show that approximately two thirds of the genomes are conserved in the two sequenced metal-tolerant strains .

a comparative genomic study was performed with the seven available sequenced mesorhizobium genomes; three metallicolous genomes  and four non-metallicolous genomes  : it shows that among annotated cds, putative genes that encode transport and sequestration proteins were over-represented in the three metallicolous mesorhizobial genomes .

rnaseq analysis, mapping and statistical analyses using deseq
the universal bacterial rrna subtraction kit  allowed for the removal of most rrnas. qualitative analyses of rna samples prior and after depletion indicated that total rna was of high quality  and that most 16s and 23s rrna peaks were removed after depletion . the mrna samples were sequenced in  <dig> bp-cycles using the illumina hiseq <dig>  with sbs technology. a lane of a flowcell was used per sample. image analyses and basecalling were conducted using the hiseq control software  and rta component . the rnaseq data are available from ncbi geo datasets under the accession number gse <dig>  the number of reads which passed the initial quality filter varied from  <dig>  to ca  <dig>  million and the quality analyses of the sequencing runs showed that the sequencing step was successful . the general characteristics of the rnaseq data, listed in table  <dig>  showed homogeneity between treatments and strains. notably, we found that more than 97% of the sequence reads were mapped at least once onto genomic objects identified via the automated annotation microscope pipeline. if we consider that total bacterial rna is composed of 95% rrna, we found that the percentage of rrna depletion was high  confirming that the kit used was well suited for our mesorhizobium strains.

* numbers of reads per sample obtained after mapping analyses are indicated together with their proportions relative to the total read numbers in parentheses.

** estimated rrna substitution rate, considering that 95% of the rna was initially composed of rrna.

***only reads that uniquely mapped, and did not map rrnas.

after removal of all rrna reads, more than  <dig> million sequence reads for each treatment mapped uniquely onto genomic objects and were used to estimate gene expression. interestingly, sequence reads were successfully assigned to all predicted genomic objects, suggesting that all cds were transcribed and that sequencing was deep enough to cover the full transcriptomes. all read mapping data for stm  <dig> and stm  <dig> are accessible from the microscope interface  <cit> . using the microscope automated rnaseq pipeline, mapping results were then translated into raw read counts for each gene and processed through the deseq statistical package  <cit>  to normalize and test for differential expression between conditions . basically, deseq estimates library size factors to normalize gene read counts between samples by assuming that a majority of genes have comparable expression levels in all samples. it then estimates gene expression dispersion due to biological and technical variations within each condition, and models it using negative binomial distributions. genes for which expression levels significantly differ from the estimated dispersion are then called as differently expressed, and deseq provides p-values adjusted for multiple testing with the benjamini-hochberg procedure  <cit>  to control the false discovery rate . although each sample  was sequenced once, deseq was able to estimate gene expression dispersion by assuming that most genes have similar expression across treatments. this method overestimates dispersion relatively to when sample replicates are available, resulting in more conservative differential expression calls and slightly lower sensitivity  <cit> . the data produced using deseq for all predicted cds are accessible from the microscope interface  <cit> .

possible ways to estimate the quality and reproducibility of the rnaseq data produced consist in comparing the distributions of  the read number per cds prior to normalization and  the differential expressions of cds in all comparisons after normalization. because we observed a wide magnitude in the read count numbers per cds, a logarithmic transformation of these data was performed. a logarithmic base- <dig> transformation of fold changes was used to represent expression differences. the additional file  <dig> reports the descriptive statistics obtained from our quantitative rnaseq datasets. the variances obtained in expression statistical analyses  were low , indicating that most predicted genes presented similar expression levels across treatments. box plots can be used to compare the general characteristics of large datasets. these were produced in order to compare the distributions of our rnaseq data between treatments but also between strains . the median read number per cds was above  <dig>  . it varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for stm  <dig> and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for stm  <dig> . the lower median read number per cds obtained from the rnaseq data of stm  <dig> can be attributed to the larger number of reads mapped on ribosomal rnas as well as the higher cds number that was predicted in this isolate. nevertheless, despite this shift in the median values, comparable distributions were found as indicated by box sizes and box plot whiskers . the box plots representing the distributions of expression differences  for all possible comparisons and for the two isolates were also very similar . in this case, the interquartile values obtained were lower than  <dig>  for all comparisons, which is equivalent to a negative or a positive fold change of  <dig>  or less for 50% of the annotated cds. furthermore, whiskers sizes  were similar between comparisons and isolates and close to a log <dig> fold change of +/−  <dig> , showing that for more than 95% of the predicted cds, fold changes under  <dig>  were observed. these results indicate that the treatments did not have a profound effect at the genome-wide expression level and that the majority of cds were not affected by the treatments. histograms showing the distributions of the log <dig> read counts for each treatment and the log <dig> fold changes for all comparisons are presented in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. interestingly, they were very similar for all treatments and therefore were not strain-specific showing that the transcriptome sequencing step was reproducible at the quantitative level.

the box plot and histogram graphical representations showed that the distributions of the data were quantitatively comparable between treatments and strains. however, these representations do not allow to test if read numbers affect differential expression variance, especially for genes that are lowly transcribed. in order to visualize and estimate data dispersion according to read count levels, scatter plots and ma plots were produced for each metal vs control comparison . these representations show that the data were highly centered in all comparisons. correlation factors  were calculated for cds classified by their mean read numbers for all scatter plots . as expected, the correlation factor generally increased with the read count number per cds, even though a rather high correlation factor  for cdss with a mean read number under  <dig> was found. altogether, our data show that the rnaseq approach produced high quality and quantitative data, even for lowly expressed cds.

quantitative pcr on selected genes
the reliability of our rnaseq data can be assessed by comparing the differential expression of a set of regulated genes using an alternative approach such as quantitative real time pcr . the relative expression of five genes present in both studied microbial genomes was estimated using qpcr. three genes presenting significant differential expression values after deseq analyses in our rnaseq data  were chosen and analyzed using two reference genes  whose expression was unaltered by metal treatment. the logarithm  ratios  were assessed in the two strains using the same pooled extracted rna samples that were used for the rnaseq. the relative expression values obtained by qpcr for each gene and for the two treatments were calculated using the mean values obtained using the two reference gene expression values as standards. these relative expression levels were compared to those obtained with the rnaseq approach . we found that the genes identified as significantly regulated using the genome-wide approach were also differentially expressed by qpcr for both isolates . despite a higher up-regulation observed by qpcr for mess2v1_ <dig> upon cd treatment on stm  <dig>  a correlation factor  above  <dig>  was found for both isolates when plotting the log <dig>  values obtained for the five selected genes using the genome-wide rnaseq approach against the qpcr data . differences in the amplitude of the deregulation between the two techniques could be attributed to the pcr step used to amplify libraries prior to illumina sequencing or to differences resulting from the mrna purification procedure. nevertheless, the high correlation between the two approaches shows that rnaseq data can be used to assess the global gene expression levels in our mesorhizobium strains and more particularly to identify the genes specifically induced or repressed by zn or cd.

to estimate the biological variance of our data, the relative expression ratios of the same target genes were also studied by qpcr in stm  <dig>  using total rna isolated from independent biological replicates as starting materials, and the ratios were compared to the results obtained using pooled rna samples . again, a high correlation factor  was obtained between replicates . we found that the relative expression values obtained from the pooled rna samples and the biological replicates were very similar with both metal treatments and the standard deviations between technical replicates were comparable to those obtained in biological replicates  and were highly correlated  . altogether, the high correlation factors we obtained show that the rnaseq data produced in the present study contain reliable relative expression values. this is in agreement and in line with the rnaseq data analyses which showed high correlations of the read count numbers between treatments at the genome-wide level. despite its relatively high cost, the rnaseq approach, which is based on transcript sequencing, represents a choice method for quantitative transcript measurements: the generated sequences are proofs of the corresponding gene transcriptional activities as compared to other indirect global approaches based on hybridization or qpcr which allow for the quantification of transcript levels for a limited set of targets.

functional composition of mesorhizobium transcriptomes and alteration upon metal exposure
the functional cog classifications of all cds in the two mesorhizobium genomes under study were obtained automatically using cognitor  <cit>  .

*  <dig>  cds out of  <dig>   were assigned to at least one cog class id for stm  <dig> 

**  <dig>  cds out of  <dig>   were assigned to at least one cog class id for stm  <dig> 

 <dig> cog class representing more than 5% of the transcriptomes for both strains and for all treatments .

 <dig> transcriptionally over-active cog class for both strains and in all treatments .

 <dig> cog class presenting a higher proportion of differentially regulated genes for both strains and both metal treatments when compared to control treatments .

to estimate absolute rna contents in mesorhizobium transcriptomes in relation to functional classes, the sums of reads for the cds assigned to each cog functional category were calculated for each treatment. the pie charts representing the proportions of each cog class  in the transcriptomes of mesorhizobium were produced using the means of read numbers for all three treatments . for all the  <dig> transcriptomes obtained by rnaseq , the median read number per cog class was calculated to distinguish the most represented classes at the quantitative level in the transcriptomes . the most represented functional categories at the transcriptional level in both isolates belonged to metabolism processes, principally cog classes e, g, p and c which refer to the metabolism and transport of amino acids, carbohydrates, inorganic ions and energy production and conversion, respectively, the poorly characterized cog class r, and class j which refers to translation and ribosome structure and biogenesis. our quantitative analysis highlights the relative content of each functional class in the transcriptomes likely to be representative of mesorhizobium growth in the medium under study. however, as expected, the number of transcripts per cog class was correlated to the number of cds per class  and is thus reflecting the relative genomic content. in order to estimate the relative transcriptional activity of each functional category, the sums of reads per cog class was normalized to their respective cds numbers . such normalization shows that the cog classes belonging to  cellular processes and signaling   information and storage processing  and  metabolism  could be considered as transcriptionally over-active as compared to the other cog classes in both isolates . these results are not surprising as the cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase which requires the involvement of many genes whose function is associated with  basic cellular processes such as cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning, cell wall/ membrane/ envelope biogenesis, signal transduction mechanisms, intracellular trafficking and  information storage and processing such as replication and translation, all of which require high energy production and conversion.

interestingly, slight differences were noted for the cog class j that refers to translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis. indeed, in both isolates, the two metal treatments triggered a decrease of the transcription levels for genes assigned to this particular cog class . box plot representations of the log <dig> fold changes between metal and control treatment data as classified by cog functional categories  confirmed this observation, suggesting that metal treatment affects translation and ribosome structure and biogenesis. these results are in line with observations made by pereira and colleagues  who found that metal exposure could affect protein levels as shown for rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae isolates  <cit> . however, despite a relatively high tolerance of our mesorhizobium isolates as compared to other mesorhizobia  <cit> , our transcriptomic data suggest that a global repression of the translation machinery occurs upon cadmium or zinc exposure; according to pereira’s hypothesis, such repression should categorize our isolates as metal sensitive. additional experiments are required to verify whether our isolates are affected in protein synthesis and compare their levels to other mesorhizobia, including strains more tolerant than those presently studied in order to validate this hypothesis and show that it is applicable to the mesorhizobium genus. interestingly, previous studies on e. coli show that upon cd exposure, protein biosynthesis machinery was stopped  <cit> .

in order to assess the effect of metals on general functional processes in the isolates, we compared the functional distribution of the most significantly deregulated genes  to which a cog class was assigned to full gene set distribution . the percentage of deregulated genes per category gives a rapid mean to estimate which cog classes are the most affected by metal treatment. interestingly, classes o and p appeared as over-represented when compared to the full gene set for both metals and both isolates. class o refers to post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones, which supports the hypothesis that protein biosynthesis and stability are affected by zn and cd exposure. class p corresponds to inorganic ion transport and metabolism, which indicates that zn or cd divalent cations are processed by bacteria as soon as they are sensed, most probably through export systems  <cit> .

identification of genes regulated by metals in mesorhizobium strains stm  <dig> and stm 4661
transcriptional profiles obtained using the genome-wide rnaseq approach was performed on pooled samples. the high reproducibility between treatments, as exemplified by the high correlation factors of read counts and relative expression values of the rnaseq datasets allowed us to obtain adjusted p-values  with deseq. putative cds presenting fdr values <  <dig>  in a “metal” vs “control” experiment are listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig> for stm  <dig> and stm  <dig>  respectively. a total of 72/ <dig>  and 68/ <dig>  putative cds  were found to be significantly differentially expressed by one or both metals for stm  <dig> and stm  <dig>  respectively. these putative differentially expressed cds are classified into six categories: transport, sequestration, regulation, oxidoreduction, others and unclassified. thirteen out of seventy-two and 13/ <dig> putative cds  encoded transport proteins, 15/ <dig> and 16/ <dig> putative cds  encoded proteins possibly involved in sequestration, 3/ <dig> and 1/ <dig>  encoded regulators, 5/ <dig> and 10/ <dig> putative cds  encoded proteins involved in oxidoreduction, 6/ <dig> and 4/ <dig> putative cds  encoded proteins possibly not involved in the metal response and 30/ <dig> and 24/ <dig> putative cds  were unclassified for stm  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. as expected, the category “unclassified” is the most represented among significant regulated putative cds. few cds are classified into the category “others” which can be assimilated to the non-specific metal response, suggesting that the rnaseq approach in our conditions is reliable and allowed us to identify the genes involved in the specific metal response. “transport” and “sequestration” are the most represented categories after the “unclassified” category among significantly regulated putative cds, which is in agreement with the fact that transport and sequestration proteins were found over-represented in the three available metallicolous mesorhizobial genomes. among the putative cds significantly regulated in stm  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  were regulated upon zn and cd exposure, respectively;  <dig> of them were regulated by both metals. in stm  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  were regulated after zn and cd treatments, respectively, and  <dig> were regulated by both metals .

among the  <dig> % and  <dig> % putative cds that are significantly and differentially expressed for stm  <dig> and stm  <dig>  respectively,  <dig> putative cds presenting homologs for both isolates were identified as significantly regulated under zn and/or cd treatments. among these conserved and significantly regulated putative cds, some had homologies to genes encoding proteins whose function could be associated to specific metal responses like metal sequestration or metal transport.

conserved and differentially regulated genes possibly involved in sequestration
metal sequestration can be used by microorganisms to reduce metal bioavailability and thereby avoid metal toxicity. metal sequestration includes cell wall components, periplasmic or cytoplasmic binding proteins involved in the precipitation of metals by phosphates or in their reduction as sulfides, and intracellular binding proteins containing cpx-zn finger domains.

among the  <dig> putative cds present and regulated by metal in both isolates, several could be involved in extracytoplasmic sequestration. indeed, we identified a putative opgc gene encoding a membrane protein required for succinylation of periplasmic glucans in m. loti <cit> . it was slightly but significantly induced upon cd exposure  in both mesorhizobium strains  but was not significantly regulated by zn . the addition of succinyl groups confers global negative charges to periplasmic cyclic glucans and may thus limit the diffusion of toxic cations into the cytoplasm through immobilization in the bacterial cell membrane. amongst the conserved and regulated cds that may be involved in metal precipitation, we also identified a putative signal peptidase ii, also referred to as aspartic peptidase, and merops family a <dig>  significantly up-regulated upon zn exposure  in both isolates. it presents similarities to the polyprotein peptidase pbrc of c. metallidurans strain ch <dig> that could participate in the precipitation of pb2+ via the generated phosphate ions thus limiting its re-entry into the cell cytoplasm after extrusion via the pib-type atpase pbra  <cit> . interestingly, a putative membrane-associated phospholipid phosphatase  located in the vicinity of the putative signal peptidase ii, aspartic peptidase, merops family a <dig> was also significantly up-regulated by zn in stm  <dig> . precipitation of metals such as cd by surface polysaccharides, phosphates, sulfides or others to form insoluble salts that reduce metal bioavailability has been observed in several microorganisms  <cit> . additionally, rnaseq data allowed us to identify a few proteins with a thioredoxin domain significantly up-regulated by cd in stm  <dig>  and up-regulated by both metals in stm  <dig> . thioredoxin is a general protein disulfide reductase believed to serve as a cellular antioxidant by reducing protein disulfide bonds produced by various oxidants and also interact with other proteins to form functional protein complexes  <cit> . a recent study has demonstrated the role of thioredoxin in the reduction of u to u and cr to cr in desulfovibrio desulfuricans g <dig>  <cit> . among our rnaseq data, we identified other cds significantly up-regulated in the two mesorhizobium strains under zn and/or cd exposure  that may be involved in the precipitation of metals by phosphates or their reduction as sulfides .

among the putative cds possibly involved in metal sequestration, we also identified several conserved hypothetical proteins that contained two cytoplasmic cpx-zn finger domains  that were significantly up-regulated  upon zn exposure in both mesorhizobium strains. cpx-zn finger domains are known to coordinate zn ions with a combination of cysteine and histidine residues. interestingly, another homolog was also found in stm  <dig> , which was significantly induced by both metals . several studies suggest a role of cytoplasmic proteins such as zn-finger proteins or cysteine residues in metal binding. on the cellular speciation of cd ions in e. meliloti, if extracellular sequestration was favored, a significant amount of intracellular metal was however measured  <cit>  which most probably results from chelation. the transcriptomic analyses of e. coli in response to a zn stress showed that adding excess external zn induced the expression of many genes that are organized in the regulon for cysteine biosynthesis, implying that zn-binding proteins containing cysteine residues are one of the mechanisms that chelate zn  <cit> . finally, the metallothionein smta and several smta-like proteins have been described to sequestrate and detoxify zn and cd through zn-fingers in synechococcus pcc <dig> , in p. aeruginosa and p. putida <cit> .

conserved and differentially regulated genes possibly involved in transport
metal transport can be used by microorganisms to limit metal entry and thereby limit negative effects on cell components. metal transport involves efflux proteins such as resistant nodulation cell-division proteins , pib-type atpases, cation diffusion facilitor proteins  or major facilitor superfamily systems   <cit> , multi-drug transporter proteins and proteins involved in metal homeostasis.

identification of candidate genes possibly involved in transport by cdf efflux systems
among the putative cds probably involved in metal efflux, we identified a putative cdf-type transporter that presented homologies with zitb, a zn-specific transporter identified in e. coli <cit>  and czcd involved notably in cd and zn resistance in c. metallidurans <cit>  that was significantly up-regulated  after zn treatment in stm  <dig> . cdf transport systems function as cation/proton antiporters and are driven by concentration, chemiosmotic gradient or potassium gradient  <cit> . surprisingly, in stm  <dig>  the homolog was fissed into two separate cds  that were similarly regulated. whether these two cds were still functional in stm  <dig> is not known. we also found in stm  <dig>  a second cds  showing strong homologies to the 5’ end of czcd that was induced by zn  and cd . however, this particular cds was located in the edge of a contig, and we therefore lack its 3’ end indicating that it could actually be the true homolog of mess4v1_ <dig> 

identification of candidate genes possibly involved in co-transport of metals and antibiotics
additionally, we identified two putative cds mdtc and mdta, encoding a permease protein and a membrane fusion protein, respectively . they were significantly induced by zn in stm  <dig> but their homologs in stm  <dig> were not significantly up-regulated by metals. both genes encoded putative rnd-type proteins involved in multidrug efflux. in lactococcus lactis and e. coli, mdta confers multiple antibiotic resistances  <cit> . it was also reported that in salmonella, mdtabc contributes to cu and zn resistance, in addition to their role in the resistance to β-lactams, novobiocin and deoxycholate  <cit> . in e. coli, a microarray analysis also demonstrated that the mdtabc operon was up-regulated in response to stress caused by excess zn, suggesting that metal ions can modulate bacterial resistance to antibiotics  <cit> . possible explanations underlying the co-selection process between metals and antibiotics include co-resistance  and cross-resistance   <cit> .

identification of candidate genes possibly involved in transport by p-type atpase systems
among the  <dig> conserved and regulated cds probably involved in metal efflux, we identified two pib-type atpases. pib-type atpase transporters belong to the large superfamily of atp-driven pumps involved in the transmembrane transport of charged substrates against their concentration gradients  <cit> . pib-type atpases are known mechanisms classically used by microorganisms to maintain constant and non-toxic levels of metals in the cytoplasm. transcriptomic analyses of e. coli or e. meliloti under zn and cd stress showed the high induction of genes encoding pib-type atpases  <cit> . exclusion from cells by efflux transporters like the pib-type atpase znta of escherichia coli <cit>  or cada of staphylococcus aureus <cit>  are among the most studied bacterial pib-type atpases. we identified, in the rnaseq data of the two mesorhizobium strains, a gene encoding a related znta  which was significantly induced upon zn exposure . intriguingly, the predicted znta was also strongly induced by cd  in stm  <dig>  while its homolog in stm  <dig> was not up-regulated, indicating that different regulatory mechanisms could operate in the two strains. in accordance with this assumption, a putative merr-type regulator with homologies to zntr was predicted upstream of znta in stm  <dig>  on the opposite strand. furthermore, we found highly different numbers of putative metal responsive regulators  predicted in their genomes. a total of  <dig> possible hmrr-encoding cds were predicted in stm  <dig>  including a zntr and a merr homolog which localized close to a locus involved in mercury transport and reduction. in contrast, only four putative hmrr-encoding genes were predicted in stm  <dig>  none of them being automatically annotated as zntr. the large number of predicted hmrr-encoding genes present in stm  <dig> suggests a more complex regulation network in this strain when compared with stm  <dig> which could explain the different transcription profiles obtained for several metal regulated genes in the two mesorhizobium strains. another pib-type atpase named cada showing homologies to cada of s. aureus  was induced by both metals studied . cada has recently been characterized using a functional screening based on heterologous expression of a cosmid library produced from stm  <dig> genomic dna . directed mutagenesis of this metal pib-type atpase which displays uncommon characteristics confirmed the involvement of the gene in the resistance of m. metallidurans stm 2683t to high zn concentrations. but alone cada does not confer maximal metal resistance, showing that other mechanisms including those identified in the present study are expected to participate in resistance to zn and cd in our metal-resistant mesorhizobial strains. it should be noted that in both stm  <dig> and stm  <dig> strains, a cds showing homologies to the transmembrane region of the cytochrome c-type biogenesis protein , homolog to ccda of bacillus subtilis or dsbd of e. coli, was located downstream of cada and similarly up-regulated by both metals . ccda encodes a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase involved in the cytochrome c-type biogenesis  <cit> . a dsbd-related gene has been identified as a metal-binding motif involved in copper tolerance in e. coli <cit> . the precise role such homologs have in our mesorhizobium strains remains to be addressed even though it is tempting to speculate on a possible involvement in metal binding via divalent metal cation-sulfide bond formation or in the functioning of the pib-type atpase by providing a reducing power.

identification of candidate genes possibly involved in transport by abc transport systems
among the differentially regulated cds, we identified three conserved cds that are organized into an operon  encoding for an abc-type transport system. these genes were significantly repressed after zn exposure  and induced upon cd exposure . these three cds contain conserved domains related to abc-type mn2+/zn2+ transport systems, including respectively the multidomain atpase component znuc , the membrane permease znub  and the soluble periplasmic zn-binding protein znua  that captures zn and delivers it to znub. these znucba orthologs are strongly repressed upon zn exposure ; therefore they may be involved in zn homeostasis in our isolates, as showed in e. coli <cit> . the transcriptional regulation of this high affinity zn-import system has been shown to be under the control of a zur  repressor that belongs to the fur  family of transcriptional regulators  <cit> . interestingly, orthologs of m. loti and e. meliloti zur proteins are present in stm  <dig> and stm  <dig>  and agrobacterium-specific conserved zur binding sites  <cit>  were also found in the promoter region of the znucba putative operon in both mesorhizobial strains . when bacteria were subjected to zn in the medium, the znucba genes were strongly repressed, suggesting, together with high homologies to other bacteria, that the presently identified atp-binding cassette transport system is also a high affinity zn-import system involved in zn homeostasis in m. metallidurans. moreover, previous work showed that other divalent cations such as fe2+, mn2+, cu2+ or cd2+ de-repressed the expression of the znu operon in e. coli <cit> . more recent studies showed that the expression of znua and znub increased upon cd exposure in salmonella sp.  <cit>  and that znua-tagged proteins increased upon cd exposure in e. coli o157:h <dig>  <cit> . this regulation could either be direct  or indirect , as suggested previously  <cit> . a possible explanation for znu induction by cd could be that direct binding of divalent cd cations to the zur regulatory repressor protein as a substitute for zn alters its conformation and makes it unable to bind dna, thus directly limiting its repressive activity. another possibility could be a deficit in intracellular zn concentration most probably through competition between zn and other cations for transporters  <cit> . in line with this later observation, we found that both zn and cd induced several efflux systems in our isolate  that may participate in the unspecific export of divalent cations, such as the pib-type atpase cada , which is significantly induced by both metals and appears important for zn adaptation in stm  <dig> . to increase our knowledge about the regulation of this high-affinity zn-import system, we used a promoter-probe reporter system  <cit>  and analyzed the transcriptional activity of the znuc  in the presence of various metal concentrations and mixes in the wild type stm  <dig> and in the cada deleted mutant. we showed that the mutant was affected in zn tolerance as previously described . we tested whether a reduction of the efflux components in stm  <dig> through cada mutation could alter the regulation of znuc upon exposure to zn/cd or to various mixes of the two metals . increasing the zn concentration in the medium reduced significantly the relative expression of znuc in the wild-type bacterium, reaching non detectable levels when  <dig>  mm zn was used, while no transcriptional activity was detected in the cada mutant . since no cd was present in the control ty medium, the fact that no induction was observed in the cada mutant, while being relatively highly induced in the wild type, indicates that intracellular zn concentrations were high enough in the mutant to repress znuc transcription, and this may result from its lower efflux capacity. when cd was added to the growth medium, we found that znuc expression increased in the wild-type bacterium in the presence of as low as  <dig>  mm, but higher cd concentrations did not further increase its expression levels and even tended to decrease them when cd concentration were above  <dig>  mm . surprisingly, znuc expression required higher cd concentrations in the mutant, reaching a maximum at  <dig>  mm cd and then decreasing again. these results support a more indirect effect of cd ions which could reduce intracellular zn levels, leading to a higher stimulation of the high-affinity zn-import system. to test whether cd competed directly with the zur regulator, the effect of various cd/zn mixes on znuc transcriptional activity was studied . no transcriptional activity was observed in the cada deletion mutant suggesting that intracellular zn concentrations were high enough in that strain to repress znuc transcription and out-competed the cd level which, furthermore, was probably extruded or sequestered via other mechanisms. yet, interestingly we found that the molar ratio of zn and cd ions in the medium affected znuc transcription in the wild-type bacterium. indeed, despite a metal-dose dependent transcriptional activity of the efflux pump cada , increasing zn/cd molar ratios from  <dig>  to  <dig> negatively affected the transcriptional activity of znuc in stm  <dig>  regardless of the total metal concentration used. these results suggest that the two divalent cations compete for binding to the zur regulator which consequently alters the regulation of znuc. our znuc transcriptional data indicate that cd generates both direct and indirect effects on znucba regulation in stm  <dig>  but additional experiments are required to decipher this complex regulation and the effects of cd on zn homeostasis.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we used comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses to study the gene expression profiles associated to zn and cd exposure and to identify putative genes involved in metal tolerance in two metallicolous mesorhizobium strains isolated from anthyllis nodules from two distinct mining sites in france. a rnaseq-based approach allowed for the rapid discovery of homologous genes that responded specifically to metals in both strains. analyses of the genes identified as significantly regulated suggest that transport and sequestration are the most important mechanisms underlying the metal response in metallicolous mesorhizobial strains. we identified proteins involved in metal homeostasis , metal or multi-drug efflux systems which allow for intracellular detoxification  and several cell membrane components, periplasmic and cytoplasmic proteins possibly involved in metal precipitation and binding to reduce metal bioavailability. surprisingly, the number of hmrr regulators and the inductibility of znta differed between our two mesorhizobium strains. additionally, the comparative rnaseq-based approach revealed a low number of genes significantly regulated in both strains  and a low number of genes involved in the non-specific metal response, indicating that the approach was fit for identifying genes that specifically respond to metals. global rnaseq analyses suggested that zn and cd also repressed the translational machinery. our study allowed to detect genes that are conserved among two metallicolous mesorhizobia isolated from distant sites, whose expression is metal-dependent and which show a potential involvement in metal tolerance. studies on the distribution of potential genetic determinants identified in the present work in other metal tolerant and sensitive anthyllis mesorhizobia will enable the definition of biomarkers. such candidates may help us to select appropriate rhizobial symbionts to be used as biofertilizers to improve phytostabilization strategies and limit the impacts of mine spoil dispersal on human health and surrounding environments. finally, functional studies on the molecular determinants identified herein and their speciation during in situ symbiotic growth will allow to evaluate their implication in the metal tolerance of our isolates and their role in symbiotic plant growth promotion on contaminated sites.
