BACKGROUND
rapeseed  is an important oilseed and energy crop. its allotetraploid genome fully comprises the two genomes of the species brassica rapa  and brassica oleracea , and the estimated genome size of b. napus is about  <dig>  gbp  <cit> . the large and complex nature of the b. napus genome makes the species a challenging target for genomic research.

the knowledge of sequence variation and especially the availability of a high number of molecular markers for a species serve as tools for various plant genetics approaches, such as marker-assisted backcrossing or map based cloning  <cit> . but also studies of linkage disequilibrium  in b. napus have indicated that ten thousands of molecular markers might be necessary for comprehensive whole-genome association studies  in this species  <cit> . owing to the size and complexity of the b. napus genome as well as the lack of a public reference genome sequence, whole-genome resequencing is extremely elaborate and costly, and therefore currently not the method of choice for assessing sequence variation and identifying dna polymorphisms in b. napus. one possibility to reduce the amount of the target sequence is transcriptome sequencing. in oilseed rape, trick et al. <cit>  identified more than  <dig>  putative single nucleotide polymorphisms  between the cultivars `tapidor’ and `ningyou 7’ through transcriptome sequencing using the illumina solexa platform. however, the transcriptome merely provides information from coding regions, where nucleotide diversity is lower compared to non-coding regions  <cit> .

an alternative approach to reduce the complexity of a genome is the use of restriction enzymes. this principle is the basis for the restriction-site associated dna  sequencing technology, which allows parallel sequencing of millions of dna fragments flanking individual restriction enzyme sites. the rad approach has been successfully applied in a number of organisms, including crop species like barley  <cit> , perennial ryegrass  <cit> , maize  <cit> , eggplant  <cit> , and artichoke  <cit> . nelson et al. <cit>  sequenced a library of eight diverse sorghum accessions to detect snps and study their genomic distribution, and they found  <dig>  snps based on an alignment to the reference genome. to our knowledge, the rad method has not been applied in earlier studies to identify sequence polymorphisms in an allotetraploid species like b. napus.

the dna polymorphisms identified by rad sequencing need to be characterized to facilitate subsequent applications. due to the availability of the b. rapa reference sequence and the annotated 95k brassica unigene  dataset  it is possible to carry out blast searches against these datasets, examine the functions of those genes with dna polymorphisms for which blast hits were obtained, and also check the genome-wide distribution of dna polymorphisms across the b. rapa chromosomes. furthermore, the categorization of genes with dna polymorphisms by gene ontologies  helps to understand signatures of selection.

here, we describe the construction of a comprehensive, well-characterized set of dna polymorphisms in b. napus based on rad sequencing. the objectives of our study were to  establish genomic rad tags from eight diverse b. napus inbred lines for high-density polymorphism detection and genotyping,  validate a subset of the identified polymorphisms by sanger sequencing, and  characterize the rad tags according to blast searches against genomic databases of b. rapa and b. napus.

RESULTS
sequencing the kpni library generated more than  <dig> million single-end reads of  <dig> bp length . sequence data have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive under submission number sra <dig>  more than 99% of the reads contained the barcode, and more than 95% contained the restriction overhang, where one mismatch was allowed . after clustering reads to rad tags and removing rad tags with more than  <dig> reads, the number of rad tags per inbred ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . altogether  <dig>  rad tags were assigned to  <dig>  rad clusters. rad clusters with one to four rad tags occurred most frequently, and there was a gradual decrease in the number of rad clusters with larger numbers of rad tags . after the filtering steps to remove intergenomic polymorphisms, nearly  <dig>  polymorphisms were detected . snps and insertions/deletions  identified at positions  <dig> to  <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig> at a read, respectively, occurred with equal frequency at each position , and only those were used for all further analyses. polymorphisms outside the aforementioned read positions were more numerous due to a higher number of sequencing errors and were therefore discarded. afterwards, altogether  <dig>  snps were detected from  <dig>  rad clusters, and  <dig> indels were detected from  <dig> rad clusters . a decrease in the number of reads per rad cluster also resulted in a decreasing number of polymorphisms per rad cluster . of all snps,  <dig> were triallelic. the remaining  <dig>  snps were biallelic and consisted of  <dig> % transitions and  <dig> % transversions , providing a ratio of  <dig> . the number of different transitions was balanced , and the number of transversions ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  .

the correlation between pairwise modified roger’s distance  estimates among all inbreds based on simple sequence repeat  data from a previous study  <cit>  and based on dna polymorphism data from rad sequencing was ρ =  <dig>  . the  <dig> rad clusters selected for validation comprised  <dig> snps, of which  <dig>  were verified to be polymorphic. out of the five non-polymorphic snps, four belonged to one specific rad cluster. rad and sanger sequencing information did not agree for  <dig> % of the inbred-allele combinations observed for the  <dig> snps.

of all rad clusters and polymorphisms,  <dig>  rad clusters ,  <dig>  snps , and  <dig> indels  were found in the b. rapa sequence data ),  <dig>  rad clusters ,  <dig>  snps , and  <dig> indels  were found in the b. rapa chromosome data, and  <dig>  rad clusters ,  <dig>  snps , and  <dig> indels  were found in the b. rapa coding sequence  data after blast searches. the transition/transversion ratio was  <dig>  calculated for the b. rapa sequence data and  <dig>  for the b. rapa cds data. rad clusters and polymorphisms were distributed evenly across the ten b. rapa chromosomes .

altogether  <dig>  rad clusters ,  <dig>  snps , and  <dig> indels  were found at least once in the brassica ug dataset after blast searches . in the search against all  <dig>  brassica ug, we found for  <dig>  ug rad clusters, for  <dig> ug snps, and for  <dig> ug indels ). a total of  <dig>  ug with rad clusters ,  <dig> ug with snps , and  <dig> ug with indels  could be assigned a function after blast searches against the uniprotkb/swiss-prot dataset. the go term representation was balanced between all ug, ug with rad clusters, and ug with snps, whereas go terms for ug with indels were generally either over- or underrepresented .

discussion
rad sequencing and representation of the b. napus genome
in our study,  <dig>  rad clusters were sequenced . with a length of  <dig> bp per rad cluster after trimming and the fact that only a very limited number of pairs of restriction sites of kpni occur within  <dig> bp, our results indicate that we obtained sequence information from eight genotypes which represents about 1% of the b. napus genome. so far, comparative sequencing of such a large part of the b. napus genome has not been performed in more than two genotypes.

to increase the genome representation through rad sequencing approaches in b. napus further, it might be useful to apply paired-end sequencing methods. also, sequencing libraries constructed with restriction enzymes cutting more frequently than kpni would result in a higher genome representation. alternatively, more than one library prepared with different restriction enzymes could be sequenced on separate lanes of a flow cell to improve the read yield. the latter two approaches have been demonstrated to be useful in sorghum  <cit> , and explain why a substantially larger percentage of the genome could be targeted by rad sequencing in that study. however, when using more than one enzyme and sequencing a number of different libraries, the necessity for enzyme-specific adapters will increase the total costs. this problem can be circumvented by using double digest rad sequencing  <cit> , where dna is digested with different restriction enzymes simultaneously.

genome-wide distribution of rad polymorphisms
the rad clusters detected in our study for b. napus were tested for their presence in the known b. rapa genome sequence. we found only about one third of the rad clusters in the b. rapa sequence, and slightly less in the b. rapa chromosome data ). the b. rapa genome has been reported to have a size of about  <dig> mbp  <cit> , whereas the size of the b. oleracea genome has been described to be larger, namely 599- <dig> mbp  <cit> . hence, it is expected that the number of rad clusters mapping to the b. oleracea genome is higher compared to the number of rad clusters mapping to the b. rapa genome, given that the g/c content, which influences the number of restriction fragments and consequently also the number of rad clusters, is identical for the two species. results from earlier studies show that this is the case, as they found that the g/c content was  <dig> % in b. rapa <cit> , and  <dig> % in b. oleracea <cit> . despite the aforementioned genome size of b. rapa, the published b. rapa reference sequence  <cit>  has a size of  <dig> mbp. we therefore conclude that a considerable part of the b. rapa genome sequence is not part of the reference sequence, which, together with the smaller genome size when compared to b. oleracea, explains the fraction of rad clusters we found in the b. rapa sequence. in addition, the blast searches might have been affected by matches against low complexity regions.

we observed an equal distribution of rad clusters across the b. rapa chromosomes . our finding suggests that we can expect a similar distribution of rad clusters with regard to the chromosomes of the unknown c genome. this result in turn suggests that polymorphisms detected from rad clusters are also uniformly distributed across the b. napus genome, which makes them an important resource not only for gwas but also other applications like high-resolution linkage mapping.

polymorphism detection and genotyping
in the examined eight b. napus inbreds, we observed for  <dig>  rad clusters a total of  <dig>  snps and  <dig> indels . considering that for snps,  <dig> bp  and for indels,  <dig> bp  of each rad cluster were regarded, we detected snps from a total of  <dig> , <dig> bp and indels from a total of  <dig> , <dig> bp. hence, we found one snp every  <dig> bp and one indel every  <dig>  bp for a very diverse set of b. napus. the study by westermeier et al. <cit>  on six b. napus winter oilseed rape varieties observed with one snp every  <dig> bp a slightly higher polymorphism frequency. this might be due to sampling effects because candidate sequences with a total length of  <dig>  kb of the b. napus genome were investigated. however, with one indel every  <dig>  bp, the study by westermeier et al. <cit>  observed a drastically higher indel frequency. this is because the relatively short reads of  <dig> bp in our study in combination with the unavailability of a reference sequence are not powerful for the detection of indels.

trick et al. <cit>  estimated the overall sequence polymorphism rate between the transcriptomes of the two cultivars ‘tapidor’ and ‘ningyou 7’ to be one snp per  <dig>  bp based on a minimum read depth of eight, or  <dig>  bp based on a minimum read depth of four. the reason for the lower snp frequency in that study when compared to ours is most likely the derivation of snps from the less polymorphic coding region. moreover, only two inbreds were investigated in the study by trick et al. <cit> , which leads to an underestimation of the snp frequency in a species.

characterization of polymorphisms
the overall representation of different transitions ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ) and transversions ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  ) we observed was in good accordance with those detected by barchi et al. <cit>  in eggplant through rad sequencing ,  <dig> % , transversions:  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ). both studies showed a preponderance of transitions over transversions, which has been observed earlier in various species  <cit> . however, the ratio of total transitions/transversions was with  <dig>  lower in our work compared to  <dig>  in the study by barchi et al. <cit> . on the other hand, in a study on dna polymorphism in b. rapa <cit> , more than  <dig>  snps were discovered and characterized in eight diverse genotypes, and a transition/transversion ratio of  <dig>  was observed. we therefore conclude that the ratio we found fits into the range of observations from comparable studies. the aforementioned research  <cit>  furthermore found a transition/transversion ratio of  <dig>  in exons and introns versus a ratio of  <dig>  in exons only. hence, our observation of a lower ratio in the b. rapa sequence data  compared to that in the coding sequence data  is in line with earlier findings from the species b. rapa.

the blast search against the ug set allowed us to identify the fractions of unigenes with rad clusters and polymorphisms. for this search it was useful to apply a large sample size, therefore we refrained from a differentiation between the b. napus a and c genomes for this part of the study. consequently, also the blastx search for each ug against the uniprotkb/swiss-prot dataset was based on the b. napus data. we observed a tight correlation between the go term representations of all ug and ug with rad clusters and polymorphisms, except for an apparent over- and underrepresentation of go terms for ug with indels . this observation is due to the small number of that polymorphism type in this work. hence, the results of our study revealed no signature of selection with respect to the distribution of polymorphisms within genes belonging to a specific go category.

verification of polymorphisms
in our study,  <dig> out of  <dig> snps  were verified to be polymorphic according to the sanger sequencing information. however, four out of the five non-polymorphic snps in our work were from one specific rad cluster. if this rad cluster was disregarded, the percentage of verified polymorphisms would be close to 100%. it is not obvious why the snps from this rad cluster could not be validated. the rad cluster was based on a low number of reads , but so were other rad clusters from which snps could be validated. a possible reason might be that this rad cluster comes from a region which is similar between the b. rapa and b. oleracea genomes. the illumina sequencing approach does not allow the assignment of the reads to the two different genomes and, thus, hemi-snps were considered as snps. in contrast, with sanger sequencing, only the snps in one of the genomes have been targeted. however, this requires further research.

the high correlation  of mrd determined with ssr markers and rad polymorphisms between pairs of the eight inbreds examined in our study  indicated that the rad polymorphisms identified are likely to be true polymorphisms. furthermore, this observation is strongly supported by the verification data of  <dig> snps by sanger sequencing, where only  <dig> % of the inbred-allele combinations observed for the  <dig> snps did not agree. trick et al. <cit>  also validated candidate snps in their study. out of nine snps that had been pcr amplified previously, eight had been called as hemi-snps according to the transcriptome sequencing data. four of the hemi-snps  were confirmed, four of the hemi-snps  were uninformative, and the ninth putative snp  was contradicted. moreover, trick et al. <cit>  found eight out of nine snps  in the aligned regions to be polymorphic in both data sets. therefore, the number of validated polymorphic rad clusters and inbred-allele combinations in our study provides a good rate of correctly called polymorphisms.

CONCLUSIONS
we applied the rad sequencing strategy in b. napus, which allowed us to detect more than  <dig>  snps and simultaneously genotype eight inbred lines. having sequenced about 1% of the b. napus genome, we managed to carry out comparative sequencing of a large part of the genome in a diverse set of the species. the equal dispersal of identified polymorphisms across the genome underlines the suitability of rad sequencing for obtaining markers useful for gwas and linkage mapping purposes. rad sequencing reduces the complexity of the genome and detects sequence variation from coding and non-coding regions across the genome. finally, the successful verification of snp information demonstrates that our rad sequencing experiment detected true polymorphisms with a high rate of correctly called alleles.
