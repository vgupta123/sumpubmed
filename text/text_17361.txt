BACKGROUND
the sin <dig> multiprotein complex plays a central role in gene silencing by deacetylating histones, and deletion of the mouse sin3a gene results in lethality at a postimplantation stage of development  <cit> . sap <dig> was initially found in saccharomyces cerevisiae and human cells as a protein which co-immunopurified with the sin <dig> corepressor complex  <cit> . in cultured cells, sap <dig> is not necessary for repression activity by the sin <dig> complex, but it participates in n-cor-mediated repression by specific transcription factors  <cit> . thus, it functions as a bridging and stabilizing molecule between the sin <dig> complex and corepressors such as n-cor  <cit>  and cir  <cit> , and dna-binding transcription factors such as yy <dig>  <cit> . mammals have one paralog of sap <dig>  named "sap30-like" , which shares 70% sequence identity with sap <dig>  <cit> . sap30l also binds to the sin3a complex and represses transcription when tethered to different promoters  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, sap <dig> has been shown to be involved in regulation of transcription of the hmr, telomeric, and rdna loci  <cit> , and sap30-deficient yeast strains have defects in ribosomal rrna processing  <cit> . consistent with a nucleolar function, we have previously identified nucleolar localization signals  in human sap <dig> and sap30l, and showed that they can direct sin3a to the nucleolus  <cit> .

recently, we identified by mass spectrometric studies a c2ch-type zinc-binding module in the n-termini of sap <dig> and sap30l  <cit> . an independent nmr-study also confirmed the results that sap <dig> proteins contain c2ch-type large zinc fingers  <cit> . this structure is essential for the stability and dna-binding activity of both proteins. close to the zinc-binding module resides a polybasic region originally identified as a nuclear localization signal  in sap30l  <cit> . we showed that this region, together with the preceding hydrophobic region, mediates specific interactions of sap30/sap30l with the monophosphoinositides  pdtins3p, ptdins4p and ptdins5p. intriguingly, dna- and pip-binding occur in the same region and compete with each other. increasing the concentration of monophosphosphoinositides leads to the release of dna from sap30/sap30l, and reduced transcriptional repression  <cit> . furthermore, we showed that sap <dig> and sap30l interact with core histones and nucleosomes and that this interaction is partly mediated by the central acidic region  <cit> .

nucleotide sequences belonging to the sap <dig> family have been found in many eukaryotic species, but most of these putative homologs remain unrecognized and uncharacterized in databases, including those of the ncbi. here we present a phylogenetic analysis of proteins of the sap <dig> family. our analyses indicate that sap30l is the ancestral protein of this family and it is found in animals, plants, fungi and some protists. a single duplication event of an ancient sap30l-bearing chromosome segment gave rise to the sap <dig> gene. the most conserved region in sap <dig> proteins is in the c-terminus, and we show by biochemical experiments that this region is responsible for association with the nuclear matrix. phylogenetic analysis reveals that sap <dig> has accumulated mutations in its c-terminus, and this has reduced its association with the nuclear matrix. this study suggests that proteins of the sap <dig> family play a role in sin3-mediated repression through multiple interactions with the nuclear matrix, nuclear proteins and dna.

RESULTS
sap <dig> and sap30l genes in the human, mouse, chicken and zebrafish genomes
the human sap <dig> and sap30l genes are located in chromosome bands 4q <dig>  and 5q <dig> , respectively . careful analyses reveal that similar genes flank the sap <dig> and sap30l genes in their respective chromosomes and, in fact, these two chromosomes are known to share duplicated segments  <cit> . the galnt  <dig> and galnt <dig> genes are located upstream of the sap30l and sap <dig> genes, respectively. on the downstream side, the sap30l gene is followed by hand <dig>  and the sap <dig> gene by hand <dig>  it is noteworthy that the degree of sequence identity between the proteins encoded by these flanking genes is similar to that between sap <dig> and sap30l, when aligned by clustal v. since the occurrence of a chromosomal duplication event seemed likely, we analyzed other organisms for the presence of this galnt-sap-hand block in order to estimate the time of the duplication event. the mouse and chicken genomes were found to have a similar, conserved galnt-sap-hand organization. the zebrafish has a predicted galnt gene upstream of the sap30l gene, and this most likely represents the ancestral chromosome segment because the zebrafish has only one member of the sap <dig> family in its genome . in the human genome, the size of the duplicated segment, vectoring the sap <dig> family genes between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  is approximately  <dig> kb. comparative analysis of human chromosome  <dig>  <cit>  has pinpointed this particular  <dig> kb region as the interchromosomally duplicated segment. furthermore, our analysis confirms that this region in chromosome  <dig> is in fact the donor template for the duplication which gave rise to the sap <dig> family ~ <dig> mya, after the actinopterygii-sarcopterygii separation  <cit> . human chromosome  <dig> and linkage group  <dig>  in the zebrafish have been shown to share most of the conserved syntenies, indicating that these are orthologous chromosomes  <cit> . although the genes in these chromosomes were syntenic in the last common ancestor of the zebrafish and human, massive intrachromosomal rearrangements have apparently occurred in the fish and/or mammalian lineages since their divergence. such rearrangements are known to occur in the sap30l-harboring human chromosome 5q region  <cit> , which is frequently deleted in myeloid malignancies such as the 5q- syndrome. the synteny between the zebrafish lg <dig> and human chromosome  <dig> has been disrupted by intrachromosomal translocations and inversions of chromosome segments. the fact that the galnt-sap microsynteny has been preserved between fish and human chromosomes, and between human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  indicates that these genes may have some kind of cooperative function. perhaps they are under common regulation or even give rise to chimeric transcripts, which are in fact predicted in the uscs database  <cit> .

identification of members of the sap <dig> family and conserved regions in the protein
a database of sequences judged to be members of the sap <dig> protein family was compiled . altogether,  <dig> members of the sap <dig> family were identified by psi-blast searches with the human sap30l sequence on a non-redundant protein sequence database. sap <dig> family sequences were found in a variety of species from animalia, plantae and fungi, as well as in several green algae but not in any chloroplastless protist. in addition, one sap <dig> family member in the ambiguous mycetozoan group was found. in the yeasts, our searches identified sap <dig> family members in only two subphyla within the phylum ascomycota: saccharomycotina and pezizomycotina. the third subphylum, taphrinomycotina seems to have lost sap <dig> family proteins during evolution, as we could not find any recognizable sequences from this subphylum, when schizosaccharomyces pombe, as a representative species whose whole genome has been sequenced, was analyzed . the composition of the sin <dig> corepressor complex in s. pombe seems to be distinct from that in other eukaryotes as its genome is reported to also lack sap <dig> and sds <dig>  <cit> , other core members of the complex. according to a comprehensive analysis of yeast evolution  <cit> , taphrinomycotina is the earliest diverging clade within the phylum ascomycota, and this divergence is estimated to have occurred ~ <dig> ±  <dig> mya  <cit> . however, sap30l was also found in plants and the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii . molecular clock analyses indicate that plants separated from the lineage leading to the mycetozoans and fungi about  <dig> ±  <dig> mya  <cit>  and thus, this is also the estimated age of the sap <dig> family.

note that the s. cerevisiae sap <dig> is judged to be sap30l  and named as such  for coherence. acti. = actinopterygii, amp. = amphibia, art. = arthropoda, eu. = eukaryota, ins. = insecta, invt = invertebrata, mam. = mammalia, mt = metazoa, vt = vertebrata, av. = aves, ech. = echinodermata, cnid. = cnidaria, myc. = mycetozoa, virid. = viridiplantae, chlor. = chlorophyta, strept. = streptophyta, sacch. = saccharomycotina, pez. = pezizomycotina.

multiple clustal w alignment of sequences of the sap <dig> family identified a highly conserved region in the c-terminus , which consists mainly of aliphatic , aromatic  and charged  residues. moreover, when the alignment is examined according to the physiochemical properties of the amino acids, this region shows 100% conservation in the nine c-terminal residues. the consensus sequence of this conserved c-terminal motif is -x---x- -x--x---x--.

the clustal w alignment of sap30/sap30l sequences shown in figure  <dig> also revealed that the nucleolar localization signal   <cit> , which consists of basic amino acids is quite conserved among the species studied. although there is no striking co-aligning nols in yeast and plants sequences, they contain polybasic region preceding c-terminal motif. as a conclusion, the c-terminal domain, nols motif and the sin3-interacting domain  represent the most ancient region in proteins of the sap <dig> family, and this domain evidently appeared early in the evolution of this family. despite the apparent lack of a co-aligning nols in yeasts, the reported functions of sap <dig> in rdna transcription  <cit>  and ribosome biogenesis  <cit>  suggest that sap <dig> is targeted to the nucleolus, and fulfills these functions in yeasts as well.

conserved domain structure in proteins of the sap <dig> family within animals
the alignment of animal sap <dig> and sap30l sequences revealed several conserved regions in these proteins . one of these is the n-terminal zinc-dependent module, in which all four zinc-coordinating residues   <cit>  are strictly conserved. the distances between these zinc-coordinating residues are highly conserved as c-×-c-×-c-×-h, suggesting that they are critical for proper folding of the zinc-binding module. the amino acids at the dna-binding interface in the loop region are also well conserved, and show mainly conservative substitutions consisting of polar and basic residues. the dna/pip-binding domain  <cit> , which constitutes the nls motif  <cit>  and comprises the polybasic region adjacent to the zinc-binding module, is also well conserved, as are the nols motif, sid domain and the acidic central region that contributes to histone and nucleosome binding  <cit> . the high degree of conservation indicates that all these modules are probably important for the function of the sap <dig> family proteins.

phylogenetic analysis and timing of the sap30l gene duplication
phylogenetic trees were generated from the clustal w alignment  of the sap <dig> protein sequences presented in table  <dig> using the distance, parsimony and likelihood methods. statistical confidence was measured by jackknife analysis with  <dig> "delete-half jackknife" data sets except in the likelihood method, in which case only  <dig> data sets were measured due to constraints imposed by computation time. all three methods gave trees with congruent topologies, the main discrepancies being the varying positions of the single representatives from the echinodermata, cnidaria and mycetozoa. a reliable positioning of these sequences would probably require more data from these taxa, and prefererably from the intermediate taxa as well, but the content of the current databases does not allow this. the extensive sequence divergence observed within the yeasts  may also explain the non-monophyly of the ascomycota in the both the parsimony and the likelihood trees. in the distance tree , as well as in the parsimony and likelihood trees , sap <dig> proteins clearly fall into one group . this strongly supports a single origin for the sap <dig> protein family. the presence of sap30l and the absence of sap <dig> in the fish  genomes suggests that the sap <dig> gene originated from the ancestral sap30l gene by duplication of a chromosome segment after the divergence of fishes  but before the divergence of amphibians which belong to the sarcopterygii . in fact, according to an analysis by friedman et al.  <dig> % of the interchromosomal duplication events that can be seen in the human genome have occurred prior to the amniote-amphibian separation  <cit> . careful inspection of the animal sap30/sap30l sequences  reveals that many amino acid substitutions are characteristic for either sap <dig> or sap30l , and therefore carry phylogenetic information about the duplication of the sap30l gene.

functional divergence of the paralogous sap <dig> and sap30l genes
it is noteworthy that the tetrapodan sap <dig> orthologs from frogs to humans  are much more dispersed in the distance tree than are the sap30l orthologs in the corresponding species . this is also evident in the alignment of animal sap30/sap30l sequences . the sarcopterygian sap <dig> proteins contain more amino acid substitutions, and many more deletions and insertions, than the sap30l proteins. in fact, the divergence and amino acid identity values for sap <dig> protein sequences between homo sapiens and xenopus tropicalis are  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for sap30l are  <dig> % and 89%. it seems that since their divergence by segmental duplication from a common ancestor, the evolutionary rate in sap <dig> proteins has been much higher than in sap30l proteins. this is what is thought to occur more generally in duplicated genes, where the new copy will evolve unencumbered by the selective constraints imposed on its progenitor  <cit> . furthermore, the evolutionary rate of amino acid substitution may increase and functional divergence may take place at the early stage of evolution after separation  <cit> . this is followed by the late stage, in which purifying selection plays a major role in maintaining related, but distinct functions. this has allowed sap <dig> to gain more length, mainly by microsatellite expansion near its n-terminus. it is not known if this has produced "gene innovation"  to sap <dig>  because the function of this n-terminal extension is currently unknown.

since the cluster-specific residues between sap <dig> and sap30l in the sarcopterygian clusters were prominent in the alignment, we tested whether these residues are functionally relevant. functional significance is highly correlated with evolutionary conservation  <cit> . if a particular amino acid site is variable in both clusters, it is unlikely to have any major functional role in either paralog. conversely, conservation of an amino acid in one cluster and lack of conservation in a sister cluster is assumed to contribute to functional differences between the paralogs. this site-specific shift in the evolutionary rate between clusters is known as type-i functional divergence  <cit> . in type-ii functional divergence, a particular site is conserved in both clusters but the physicochemical property of the amino acid is different between the clusters  <cit> . to test if the cluster-specific residues in sap <dig> and sap30l are indicative of type-i divergence, we estimated the coefficient of functional divergence , which measures the difference in the evolutionary rate at amino acid sites between gene clusters. rejection of the null hypothesis  is strong evidence for altered functional constraints after gene duplication   <cit> . we found significant evidence for type-i divergence in the comparison between sarcopterygian sap <dig> and sap30l clusters , but not in the control comparison between sarcopterygian and arthropodan sap30l clusters , which reflects the situation before the gene duplication. similarly, significant type-ii functional divergence was detected only between sap <dig> and sap30l clusters , whereas it was undetectable before the gene duplication . to put these findings into perspective, the human sap <dig> and sap30l share 70% amino acid identity, whereas the human sap30l and the drosophila melanogaster sap30l share only 50% identity. this latter comparison clearly shows that it is mostly the neutral amino acid sites with no functional role that are variable, whereas after the gene duplication , functional divergence has taken place.

to conclude, after the sarcopterygian radiation around  <dig> mya, the duplicated sap <dig> has diverged functionally from the ancestral sap30l. in contrast, evolutionary constraints have kept sap30l functionally unchanged for ~ <dig> my, since the separation of arthropods and sarcopterygians  <cit> . in spite of considerable divergence in sequence, only functionally insignificant changes constitute the sequence differences in sap30l between these two clades. this presumably reflects the fact that purifying selection has acted to conserve sap30l.

the site-specific profile for the amino acid residues deemed responsible for type-i and type-ii functional divergence  show that most of the functional divergence is found in the c-terminal region and between the experimentally identified domains. however, previous experiments have shown that: i) the repression capacity of sap <dig> is only half of that of sap30l, ii) sap30l is able to self-oligomerize in vivo whereas sap <dig> is not, and iii) sap30l is more concentrated in the nucleolus than sap <dig> in transfection experiments  <cit> . these biochemical data, together with the molecular evolutionary analysis described here, suggest that the original functions are executed by sap30l, but in sap <dig> these functions are abandoned or suppressed.

the functional divergence between sap <dig> and sap30l is due to differences in their association with the nuclear matrix
although the c-terminal region is the most conserved part in proteins of the sap <dig> family, considerable type-i and type-ii functional divergence has occurred in this region after the separation of the sap30l and sap <dig> genes . our previous subcellular fractionation experiments showed that nuclear retention of sap30l is achieved by interaction with dna through the n-terminal domain  <cit> . we also demonstrated that the c-terminus has a role in nuclear retention, because c-terminally truncated mutants of sap30l leaked to the cytoplasm in transfection studies  <cit> . we therefore asked whether the c-terminal region constitutes a nuclear matrix association sequence. when myc-tagged constructs of wild type  sap <dig> and sap30l were transfected into hela cells and the nuclear matrix was isolated, we noticed that staining of the perinucleolar ring was resistant to triton-x and dnase i treatments, indicating that the proteins remained attached to the nuclear matrix in the perinucleolar ring region . sap30l1- <dig> was completely soluble, while the 1– <dig> and 1– <dig> versions showed some attachment to the nuclear matrix . intriguingly, sap30l seemed to be bound more tightly than sap <dig>  suggesting that sap <dig> has accumulated mutations that hinder its association with the nuclear matrix. in order to gain more quantitative data, we performed subcellular fractionation experiments and found that sap <dig> was considerably more soluble than sap30l, which accumulated in the nuclear matrix/chromatin fractions. the 1– <dig> mutant of sap30l showed markedly reduced accumulation in the nuclear matrix/chromatin fraction, and the 1– <dig> and 1– <dig> mutants were also more soluble than wt sap30l , indicating that an intact c-terminus is necessary for the association with the nuclear matrix . since the nuclear matrix participates in gene transcription  <cit>  and repression  <cit> , the impaired association of the 1– <dig> version of sap30l with the nuclear matrix could explain its previously observed, reduced repression activity  <cit> .

we recently showed that the n-terminal zinc-dependent module and the following hydrophobic region together with polybasic region/nls are needed for dna binding in vitro and chromatin association in vivo  <cit> . as shown in figure 6c , solubilization of chromatin with micrococcal nuclease does not detach wt sap <dig> or wt sap30l from the nuclear matrix. their attachment is dependent on an intact c-terminus, which thus constitutes a nuclear matrix association sequence . the association of sap <dig> with the nuclear matrix seems to be weaker than that of sap30l. alternatively, sap <dig> may possess a less effective nls or nols and/or a more effective nuclear export signal . interestingly, sin3a has also been reported to associate with the nuclear matrix  <cit> , and we used it as a control nuclear matrix protein. taken together, these findings show that proteins of the sap <dig> family are able to interact with co-repressors , associate with the nuclear matrix, and bind dna, and therefore possess many characteristics typical of nuclear scaffolding proteins  <cit> . a well studied example of nuclear scaffolding proteins is provided by members of the runx family of transcription factors, which are tissue-specific regulatory proteins involved in the control of hematopoiesis , osteogenesis , and differentiation of neural and gastrointestinal cells   <cit> . their n-terminal parts bind specific dna sequences, whereas the c-terminal domains interact with coregulatory factors and associate with the nuclear matrix  <cit> , a domain organization similar to that in proteins of the sap <dig> family. in addition, the subcellular localization of proteins of the two families also bears similarities, as runx proteins are focally localized within the nucleus and some of them are actually found in the nucleolus  <cit> . interestingly, the nuclear matrix association sequence in both protein families is comprised of a stretch of hydrophobic residues flanked by hydrophilic residues .

it is now widely accepted that in higher organisms such as mammals, a particular function is often assigned to a gene family rather than to a single gene. many gene families are thought to have originated by gene duplication at an evolutionary stage when most vertebrates were still aquatic  <cit> . the members of a gene family perform the same or similar function, but in slightly different and overlapping ways. in the case of the sap <dig> family, these subtle differences may be exploited during ontogeny, given the crucial role reserved for the sin3a complex in embryogenesis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, we have described the molecular evolution of the sap <dig> protein family and its genesis from a single chromosome segment duplication event. our analyses indicate that the ancestral sap30l protein is conserved in animals, plants, fungi and some chloroplast-containing protists. we have identified many new members of the sap <dig> family from different species and a conserved c-terminal domain which is responsible for association with the nuclear matrix. the phylogenetic and biochemical analyses have uncovered functional divergence between sap <dig> and sap30l in the domain that associates with the nuclear matrix. these data will facilitate further studies on the functional role of proteins of the sap <dig> family in the sin3-hdac corepressor complex, and possibly other complexes as well.
