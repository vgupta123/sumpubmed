BACKGROUND
lesquerella   <cit> , is a potential brassicaceae oilseed crop for the southwest region of the united states. the seed oil of lesquerella is rich in lesquerolic acid , a hydroxy fatty acid  comprising 55-60% of total seed fatty acids  <cit> . the conventional source of hfa is castor  seeds; 90% of castor oil is ricinoleic acid . ricinoleic acid and its derivatives are used as raw materials for numerous industrial products, such as lubricants, plastics and surfactants  <cit> . the production of castor oil, however, is hampered by the presence of the toxin ricin and hyper-allergic 2s albumins in its seed. lesquerella on the other hand, does not have such biologically toxic compounds, and thus its oil represents a safe source of hfa. with the development of clean and renewable energy, hydroxy fatty acid methyl esters of lesquerella oil were found to be excellent lubricity enhancers in diesel fuels  <cit>  that replace sulfur-based petroleum lubricity additives, and thus reduce environmental pollution. besides the hfa, several co-products can be obtained from lesquerella. seed meal after oil extraction is high in protein and the amino acid lysine and could be used as livestock feed  <cit> . gums from the seed coat and seed meal could be used as thickening or gelling agents in food and pharmaceutical products  <cit> .

considerable efforts have been made to improve the agronomics of lesquerella through plant breeding  <cit> . furthermore, stable genetic transformation has been established in lesquerella  <cit> , which provides means to quickly improve this crop through genetic engineering. currently, the united states department of agriculture  national plant germplasm system  has a phyasaria germplasm collection of over  <dig> accessions representing  <dig> species. variation in fatty acids among species was reported. in species p. lindheimeri and p. pallida, 20:1-oh was the most abundant, comprising over 80% in seed oil  <cit> . some species have seeds with oil rich in other hfas, such as densipolic acid  in p. perforata, p. stonensis, p. densipila, p. lyrata, and p. lescurii   <cit> . in species p. auriculata and p. densiflora, auricolic acid  was the prevalent hfa, at 34-40% levels  <cit> . these species with different hfa profiles are valuable genetic resource and may contribute to the improvement of lesquerella cultivars.

seed oil is stored as triacylglycerol . biosynthesis of tag in lesquerella follows the pathways for fatty acid  in the plastid and tag in the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> . after the fas are synthesized in the plastid , they are released and then converted to acyl-co-enzyme a . the newly synthesized acyl-coas can be incorporated into tag through the glycerol-3-phosphate  pathway also known as the kennedy pathway  <cit> . briefly, g3p is first acylated by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase , followed by a second acylation by the acyl-coa:acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase , yielding phosphatidic acid . pa is then hydrolyzed to form diacylglycerol , which is finally used as a substrate for the diacylglycerol acyltranstransferase  to produce tag. the newly synthesized acyl-coas can also be incorporated directly into membrane lipid phospatidylcholine  by the acyl editing reactions or lands cycle  <cit> . these acyl editing reactions can be catalyzed either by forward and reverse reactions of lyso-pc acyltransferase  to yield acyl-coa, or by a phospholipase a–type activity to yield a free fa that then is activated to acyl-coa. since pc is the substrate for many fa-modifying enzymes , rapid de-acylation and re-acylation of pc results in an acyl-coa pool enriched with modified fas, which are then utilized for tag synthesis  <cit> . additionally, accumulating evidence indicates that many plants utilize pc-derived dag to synthesize tag. the main pc to dag conversion is catalyzed by phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase  through the phosphocholine headgroup exchange between pc and dag  <cit> . thus acyl editing and pc-dag interconversion through lpcat and pdct, respectively, may co-contribute to the formation of tags with enriched modified fas. besides, tag synthesis is not as simple as the sequential acylation of glycerol with gpat, lpat, and dgat by the kennedy pathway. the enzyme phospholipid:dag acyltransferase  also syntheses tag by transacylation of the sn- <dig> fa from pc onto sn- <dig> position of dag, with lyso-pc as a co-product  <cit> .

the molecular and biochemical bases of hfa synthesis have been investigated mostly in castor, lesquerella, and arabidopsis   <cit> . based on studies in castor, 18:1-oh is formed by the hydroxylation of 18: <dig> esterified to the sn- <dig> position of pc  <cit> . then, the 18:1-oh is released from 18:1-oh-pc and activated to 18:1-oh-coa. in lesquerella, due to an efficient microsomal elongation system, newly formed 18:1-oh-coa is elongated to 20:1-oh-coa  <cit> . genes encoding the oleate 12-hydroxylase  have been isolated from castor   <cit>  and lesquerella   <cit> . . arabidopsis is a model oilseed that usually does not produce hfa. expression of the rcfah <dig> in arabidopsis leading to hfa accumulation thus demonstrated that this enzyme is directly responsible for synthesis of 18:1-oh  <cit> . expression of pffah <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit>  and yeast  <cit>  has revealed that the lesquerella enzyme is bifunctional and can catalyze ∆ <dig> hydroxylation to produce 18:1-oh and ∆ <dig> desaturation to produce 18: <dig>  in lesquerella, a gene encoding a condensing enzyme, pfkcs <dig>  has been isolated, and its activity has been shown to specifically catalyze elongation of 18:1-oh-coa  <cit> . besides 18:1-oh and 20:1-oh, lesquerella seed accumulates a low level of 20:2-oh, which is formed by a microsomal ∆ <dig> desaturase  <cit> .

although enzymatic reactions and key genes involved in the hfa synthesis have been elucidated, mechanisms contributing to the accumulation of hfa in tag are largely unknown. transgenic experiments have consistently failed to achieve high yields of desired hfas. seed-specific expression of rcfah <dig> in arabidopsis resulted in hfa accumulation at 17% of total seed lipids  <cit> , which is much lower than 90% level of 18:1-oh in castor seeds. efforts have been made to search for additional genes, especially those involved in a final step of tag synthesis. it was shown that co-expression of a second gene, rcdgat <dig>  <cit>  or a rcpdat  <cit>  boosted hfa content from 17% to nearly 30% or 25-27%, respectively. when triple transgenic arabidopsis  is compared with a double transgenic line , hfa increased slightly from  <dig> % to  <dig> %  <cit> . with the discovery of pdct, a castor gene rcpdct was co-expressed in the transgenic arabidopsis line carrying rcfah. it indeed increased hfa from 17% to 23% in arabidopsis  <cit> . additional expression of rcdgat <dig> further enhanced the hfa content to 28%  <cit> .

broadening our knowledge on hfa-containing tag biosynthesis undoubtedly requires the identification of more genes involved in hfa and tag metabolism. the high-throughput  <dig> gx flx pyrosequencing is a superior technology for transriptome analysis. it revolutionizes science by enabling users to acquire massive genome-wide data rapidly with low cost and labor. because the method increases sequencing depth and coverage, it allows assembly of overlapping reads without a references sequence. it is particularly suitable for use in organisms whose genomic sequences are unknown. prior to our work, there are only  <dig> lesquerella microsatellite sequences and ests in genbank . in this study, we adopted  <dig> gx flx pyrosequencing to analyze the seed transcriptome of lesquerella. we describe here identification of  <dig>  unique transcripts from a total of  <dig> mega-base raw sequences, including transcripts for the majority of enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis and metabolism. we further characterize the expression profiles of  <dig> key lipid genes in various tissues of lesquerella, including developing seeds, leaf, stem, root, and flower buds using quantitative pcr  assays. our results provide information on key target genes that can be useful in the design of future studies involving manipulation of hfa production in plants.

RESULTS
the transcriptome represents a major source for lesquerella seed genes
to obtain a comprehensive profile of the transcriptome of lesquerella seeds, selecting a sample at an optimal stage during seed development is critical. according to our previous studies in lesquerella, the entire course of seed development took about  <dig> days after pollination   <cit> . when developing seeds entered mid-maturation stages, 28- <dig> dap, storage lipids, proteins, and other components of dry weights accumulated at maximum rates. based on analysis of hfa accumulation and gene expression  <cit> , we observed rapid synthesis and accumulation of tag and major hfa  from  <dig> to  <dig> dap. accompanying the accumulation of 20:1-oh, transcript levels of hydroxylase gene, pffah <dig>  and elongase gene, pfkcs <dig>  also increased steadily  <cit> . the collective data suggest that seeds at 28- <dig> dap are enriched in the transcripts for enzymes involved in the synthesis and accumulation of 20:1-oh. therefore, we determined that  <dig> dap is a suitable time point for seed transcriptomic analyses. by twice deep sequencing using a cdna library prepared from developing lesquerella seeds at  <dig> dap, we generated a total of  <dig> , <dig> clean reads which is equivalent to  <dig> , <dig> bases . because there is no reference genome of lesquerella, de novo assembly was performed by gs de novo assembler . among total reads,  <dig>  reads were completely assembled and  <dig>  reads were partially assembled to generate total  <dig>  isotigs . the average isotig length is  <dig> bp , longer than the average isotig size of  <dig> bp observed in bitter melon seed transcriptome using cap <dig> assembly software  <cit> ,  <dig> bp in ammopiptanthus monolicus root transcriptome using newbler  <cit> , and  <dig> bp in camelina sativa seed transcriptome using trinity  <cit> . a mean isotig length of  <dig> ±  <dig> bp was reported for camelina seed transcriptome  <cit> . however, this number was obtained by assembling  <dig> reads  together with sanger sequenced est clones  using newbler v <dig>  gs assembler. about  <dig>  reads not overlapping with any other reads were assembled to  <dig>  singletons . since our singletons were cleaned and validated with seqclean and lucy, the numbers of singletons and isotigs in combination indicate  <dig>  total protein coding transcripts in our seed transcriptome. overall, isotigs and singletons together were assembled from  <dig>  reads which counted 41% of total reads . about 57% of reads were identified as repeated regions . a total of  <dig>  repeat region reads were blast searched in silva rrna database  <cit> . among them,  <dig>  reads  matched rrna sequences and  <dig>  reads  had no homologies. the rrna sequences encode 28s, 26s, 18s, and 16s ribosomal rnas. these rrnas were probably carried over during mrna purification process. the assembly analysis also generated  <dig>  isogroups , which represent  <dig>  unique genes in the lesquerella seed transcriptome .table  <dig>

to functionally categorize lesquerella isotigs and singletons, we performed gene ontology  analysis. the isotigs and singletons were searched against ncbi non-redundant protein database , using the blastx program with an e-value cut-off of 1e- <dig>  among  <dig>  isotigs and  <dig>  singletons,  <dig>  isotigs  and  <dig> singletons  had at least one match to known protein sequences in the ncbi nr database. these isotigs or singletons fell mainly into three go categories: biological process , cellular component , and molecular function . the remaining  <dig>   isotigs and  <dig>   singletons were not assigned . in the category of “biological process”, a substantial percent of isotigs   and singletons   were classified in sub-category ‘metabolic process’. in category “cellular component”, ‘cell part’ had a largest percent of isotigs   and singletons  . within the category of “molecular function”, ‘catalytic activity’ and ‘binding’ are the two top sub-categories, with  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively for isotigs, , and  <dig> % and 29% respectively for singletons . as indicated above, the assemble analysis also generated  <dig>  isogroups or unique genes. when these unique genes were searched against ncbi nr database,  <dig>  isogroups  matched annotated coding genes, whereas  <dig>  found no homologous sequences. besides, about  <dig>   of the  <dig>  isogroups with matches to known protein coding sequences had the highest homology to genes from arabidopsis, a model dicot plant. table  <dig> lists the top  <dig> most highly expressed genes represented by isogroups in the lesquerella seed transcriptome and their corresponding gene products based arabidopsis orthologs. among them, genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and metabolism were detected. these included genes encoding fatty acid desaturase  <dig> , 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase , acyl-activating enzyme  <dig> , hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  <dig>  and oleosins. overall, these results demonstrate that the transcriptome data presented here provide comprehensive representation of expressed genes in developing lesquerella seed. these annotations provide a major new resource for investigating specific processes, structures, functions, and pathways that will guide research on lesquerella. moreover, the transcriptome analysis indicates that lesquerella is closely related to arabidopsis, which allows for translational research for seed quality enhancement in lesquerella.figure  <dig>

the transcriptome covers a broad spectrum of genes involved in acyl-lipid metabolism
since lesquerella is a brassicaceae oilseed crop, we used the acyl-lipid metabolism database  <cit>  developed for model brassicaceae oilseed arabidopsis  <cit>  to investigate lesquerella genes involved in acyl-lipid metabolism. we queried the transcriptome assembly to predict lesquerella orthologs of arabidopsis lipid metabolic pathway components using reciprocal best-hits  blast approach. a total of  <dig>  arabidopsis genes from  <dig> sub acyl-lipid metabolism group from the lipid metabolism database  <cit>  were used to query the lesquerella transcriptome using local blastn. although our lesquerella genes were limited to developing seed, whereas the acyl-lipid metabolism database includes whole genome-wide acyl-lipid genes, we are able to detect total  <dig> lesquerella genes representing each sub acyl-lipid metabolism group . two subgroups, fatty acid synthesis and triacylglycerol biosynthesis, of lesquerella genes had  <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively, which are very close to the numbers of  <dig> and  <dig> respectively of arabidopsis genes obtained from a microarray study on genes expressed in seeds  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  isotigs and singletons involved in acyl-lipid metabolism showing high sequence identity with arabidopsis genes were identified. the average number of transcripts for each subgroup were:  <dig> in subgroup of triacylglycerol biosynthesis and  <dig> in subgroup of fatty acid synthesis. the rest of subgroups each had 2- <dig> average transcript numbers. the result indicates that our seed transcriptome is highly representative of transcripts for fatty acid and tag biosynthesis. we conclude that our selection of developing seeds at  <dig> dap was suitable for studying acyl-lipid metabolism in lesquerella.table  <dig>

genes involved in fatty acid and tag biosynthesis are well-represented in the transcriptome
to understand hydroxy fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism in lesquerella, we further deeply mined the transcriptome assembly for genes involved in fatty acid and tag biosynthesis. using known arabidopsis genes listed in the acyl-lipid metabolism database, we identified lesquerella orthologs for nearly all the genes involved in fatty acid and tag biosynthesis; the number of isotigs for each gene varied from  <dig> to  <dig> . among  <dig> genes,  <dig>  had a representative isotig encoding full length cdna. the ones coding for partial cdna sequences covered 23-97% of their full length sequences. strikingly, we found a high percentage of sequence identity between arabidopsis and lesquerella genes. out of  <dig> genes,  <dig> had nucleotide identity at 90-99%, with an average identity overall of 90%. the remaining  <dig> had 80-89% identity . the very high sequence identity between arabidopsis and lesquerella genes suggests a similar high degree of conservation of their functions in seeds that enables translational research and facilitates genetic engineering of lesquerella lines with desirable oil content and fatty acid composition.table  <dig>

fatty acid biosynthesis in plastids
we examined our collection of lesquerella transcripts for representatives of key genes encoding the known steps of fatty acid biosynthesis in plastids . fatty acid biosynthesis begins with the rate-limiting conversion of acetyl-coa to malonyl-coa by acetyl-coa carboxylase, a heteromeric complex enzyme composed of  <dig> subunits:  <dig> beta-carboxyltransferase  encoded by the plastid genome and biotin carboxyl-carrier protein , biotic carboxylase , and alpha-carboxyltransferase , each encoded by the nuclear genome. in the lesquerella transcriptome, transcripts encoding bccp and α-ct subunits were identified with  <dig> isotigs and  <dig> isotigs, respectively . in arabidopsis, two paralogous of bccp genes, bccp <dig>  and bccp <dig>  were characterized with bccp <dig> being the more highly expressed during embryo development  <cit> . in lesquerella seed,  <dig> isotigs of pfbccp <dig> and  <dig> isotigs of pfbccp <dig> were identified, and the longest, isotig <dig> and isotig <dig>  shared 88% and 89% nucleotide sequence identity, respectively, to arabidopsis homologous. we did not detect bc and β-ct in the lesquerella seed transcriptome, which could be due to a low level of their transcripts in  <dig> dap seeds. we detected lesquerella homologs of all five isoforms of plastid acyl-carrier proteins  reported in arabidopsis   <cit> . among them, pfacp <dig> , corresponding to at5g <dig> isoform, was the mostly expressed . a gene encoding malonyl-coa acp transferase  was also identified in lesquerella with  <dig> isotigs, and the longest isotig <dig> showed 93% nucleotide sequence identify with its arabidopsis mcmt homolog .

fatty acid synthesis is continued by an acyl-chain specific condensing enzyme subunit , and the common component of 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase , 3-hydroxyacyl-acp dehydratase , and 2-enoyl-acp reductase  . we tried to identify transcripts for three key fatty acid synthases, 3-ketoacyl-acp synthase  iii, i, ii using arabidopsis kasiii , kasi  and kasii  genes as queries, but only pfkasii was detected. it had  <dig> isotigs, and the longest, isotig <dig>  showed 91% identity with arabidopsis seed homolog kasii  <cit> . the other two kas transcripts are apparently missing or rare in the 30-day seed transcriptome. based on arabidopsis kar , had , and er , we detected pfkar  , pfhad  and pfer  in lesquerella seed. stearoyl-acp desaturase  catalyzes the conversion of 18:0-acp to 18:1-acp in plastids . arabidopsis has seven sad family genes including fab <dig>  and des <dig> ; fab <dig> is the most highly expressed  <cit> . indeed the fab <dig> plays a major role in the reaction  <cit> . in the seed transcriptome, lesquerella fab <dig> homologues were detected with  <dig> isotigs; no homologous isotig was detected for des <dig> . two fatty acid thioesteases, fata  and fatb , were detected with  <dig> and  <dig> isotigs, respectively in lesquerella seed . long chain acyl-coa synthase  is located the membrane of plastid outer envelopes and catalyzes addition of coa to free fatty acids to produce the fatty acyl-coa’s utilized in the endoplasmic reticulum. two arabidopsis plastid-localized lacs <dig>  and er-localized lacs <dig>  have been reported  <cit> . in the lesquerella seed transcriptome,  <dig> isotig of pflacs <dig> and  <dig> isotigs of pflacs <dig> were identified .

endoplasmic reticulum-associated fatty acid hydroxylase, desaturases and elongase
seed oil of lesquerella contains 55-60% 20:1-oh, and two key genes, pffha <dig> and pfksc <dig>  directly responsible for synthesis of this unusual fatty acid have been previously identified  <cit> . in our seed transcriptome, we found  <dig> and  <dig> isotigs representing pffah <dig> and pfkcs <dig>  respectively . the detailed temporal expression patterns of pffah <dig> and pfkcs <dig> during lesquerella seed development were reported  <cit> . both of the genes showed a bell-shaped expression pattern with a peak at  <dig> dap. the increased expression of pffah <dig> and pfkcs <dig> coincided with the increased synthesis and accumulation of hfa-containing tag during lesquerella seed development  <cit> .

er-associated microsomal oleoyl pc desaturase encoded by fad <dig> is known to introduce a double bond at the ∆ <dig> position of 18: <dig> on pc and convert it to linoleic acid  . during the entire course of seed development, lesquerella accumulates 18: <dig> at  <dig> - <dig>  mol% in tag with an average of  <dig>  mol% in tag  <cit> . the presence of a constant level of 18: <dig> in lesquerella seeds indicates that an oleate desaturease activity is maintained at a relatively steady level. in this study, transcripts of pffad <dig> desaturase were detected with  <dig> isotigs, fewer than those of pffha <dig> and pfksc <dig>  the results of temporal expression profile analysis indicated that pffad <dig> is expressed at a relatively constant level throughout most stages of seed development up to  <dig> dap, but drops about 95% by the latest stage sampled,  <dig> dap . the temporal expression pattern of pffad <dig> observed in this study is slightly different from that previously reported   <cit> , where a bell-shaped pattern of pffad <dig> expression was observed that peaked at  <dig> dap and decreased at  <dig> and  <dig> dap  <cit> . we noted in that study that the change of the expression level of pffad <dig> during seed development was moderately dynamic. in young seeds up to  <dig> dap, the expression were already 36-48% of that of  <dig> dap. during 28- <dig> dap maturation stages, seeds boosted the expression only  <dig> to 4-fold  <cit> . the difference of pffad <dig> expression pattern at  <dig> dap in the two studies could be due to variation in seed sample groups. nonetheless, the constitutive or less dynamic temporal expression patterns of pffad <dig> indicated its house-keeping function for membrane lipid during seed development. similar temporal patterns were found in some other house-keeping genes involved in seed oil biosynthesis in arabidopsis  <cit>  and castor  <cit> . in this study, we further characterized the expression profile of pffad <dig> in leaf, stem, root and flower bud tissues . we found that leaf had a level similar to that of developing seeds. the result is consistent with previously reported data of northern blot analysis  <cit>  or reverse transcription pcr  <cit> . however, a  <dig> -fold higher expression of pffad <dig> in flower than leaf was observed . since our flower buds contain about 26% pollen by weight, it is likely that pffad <dig> plays a key role in converting 18: <dig> to 18: <dig> to meet the demand of maintaining a basic level of 18: <dig> in lesquerella pollen. similar results was reported for a safflower fad2- <dig> that was expressed at a higher level in flower than cotyledon, hypocotyl, root, leaf and seed  <cit> . in addition, a fad <dig> from brassic napus was also found to be highly expressed in flower buds, and the expression was associated with membrane lipids and storage oil biosynthesis in pollen  <cit> . recently, pffad <dig> has been shown to encode functional Δ <dig> desaturase activity in transformed yeast  <cit> . although the bi-functional enzyme encoded by the pffah <dig> gene also has some oleate 12-desaturase activity  <cit>  that could convert some of the 18: <dig> to 18: <dig>  we suggest that pffad <dig> plays an essential role in the desaturation of 18: <dig> in all cells and tissues.figure  <dig>

interestingly fad <dig> transcripts were detected with the highest number  among all genes involved in fatty acid and tag biosynthesis . these fad <dig> may catalyze pc-18: <dig> to pc-18: <dig> and/or pc-18:1-oh to pc-18:2-oh in lesquerella . result of amino acid alignment of the isotigs indicated that there are two fad <dig> isoforms in lesquerella compared to single fad <dig> gene in arabidopsis . pffad3- <dig>  represented by isotig <dig>  had 93-95% identity to arabidopsis atfad <dig> and brassica napus bnfad3a, bnfad3b, and bnfad3c  <cit> , indicating a common fad <dig> in brassicaceae plants. however, pffad3- <dig>  represented by isotig <dig>  is an isoform diverged from all the above fad3s, with only 78-81% identity to atfad <dig> and bnfda3s . isotig <dig> and isotig <dig> showed distinct n-terminal coding regions . our expression profiling studies indicate that the expression of pffad3- <dig> progressively increased during seed development reaching a peak at  <dig> dap, and then dropped sharply to undetectable levels at late stages  <dig> and  <dig> dap . the induction between  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap was 33-fold. moderate levels of expression were detected in leaf, stem and root. in flower bud, the expression was at about 6-fold higher than in seeds at  <dig> dap . the temporal and spatial expression pattern of pffad3- <dig> is quite different from that of pffad3- <dig> . at early stages of seed development , the expression of pffad3- <dig> was high and then declined quickly when seeds progressed to mid- and late-stages. no expression was detected in leaf, stem, root and flower buds. in our seed transcriptome , many more pffad3- <dig> transcripts were detected  than lffad3- <dig>  . this could be due to that the sample used for transcriptome study represented relatively young seeds. based on the expression profiles of these two pffad <dig> genes, we suggest that both of them may contribute to the desaturation of fa in developing seeds, but pffad3- <dig> had a pattern similar to that of arabidopsis , and thus it may have a more general role in converting 18: <dig> to 18: <dig> in other organs. since lesquerella seeds accumulate moderate amounts of 18:2-oh and 20:2-oh, the divergent and also seed-specific pffad3- <dig> isoform might have evolved to desaturate 18:1-oh and 20:1-oh. further functional characterization of pffad3- <dig> and pffad3- <dig> needs to be carried out in order to determine their enzymatic activity and substrate specificity in acyl-lipid metabolism.figure  <dig>

the conventional kennedy pathway for tag synthesis utilizes three acyl-coa-dependent acyltransferases, gpat, lpat and dgat, that sequentially acylate the sn-1- and sn-2- and then sn-3-position of g3p with acyl-coa . since the synthesis of membrane glycerolipids also begins with sequential acylation of the sn-1- and sn-2- positions of g3p, gpat and lpat are common to synthesis of tag and membrane glycerolipids. using a bioinformatics approach, a new gpat  was identified in arabidopsis that exhibited extensive homology with a gpat from mammalian cells involved in storage oil formation; that gpat was postulated to be a putative atgpat <dig> for er associated membrane and storage lipid biosynthesis in plants  <cit> . for the second acyl-coa transferase, arabidopsis lpat <dig>  was found to be an er-localized and involved in tag and membrane lipid biosynthesis  <cit> . using arabidopsis genes , we identified lesquerella orthologs of pfgpat <dig> and pflpat <dig>  each represented by  <dig> isotigs . result of gene expression analysis indicated that both genes were expressed at a similar level in most samples examined, including leaf, stem, flower bud, and developing seeds from  <dig> dap to  <dig> dap, with the exception of pflpat <dig> levels in stem tissue, where expression was only about 50% that detected in leaf . low levels of expression were detected in root and developing seeds at  <dig> dap . our spatial and temporal expression profiles of pfgpat <dig> and pflpat <dig> were similar to those from arabidopsis  <cit> . based on the overall spatial and temporal expression profiles of pfgpat <dig> and pflpat <dig>  we suggest both genes playing essential housekeeping roles in membrane and storage lipid biosynthesis throughout plant life.

dgat catalyzes the final and rate-limiting step of tag biosynthesis . there are three sequence-unrelated classes of dgats reported in plants: membrane bound dgat <dig> and dgat <dig>  and cytosolic dgat <dig>   <cit> . using arabidopsis dgat <dig> , dgat <dig> , and dgat <dig>  as queries, seven lesquerella orthologs were identified in the seed transcriptome . phylogenic analysis among dgat genes from lesquerella, arabidopsis, castor bean and peanut shows that the membrane type  <dig> , type  <dig>  and type  <dig>  are divided into three different clades . the result of amino acid alignment of the isotigs indicates that there are two pfdgat <dig> isoforms in lesquerella compared to single dgat <dig> gene in arabidopsis . isotig <dig> and isotig <dig> had overall similarities in nucleotide and amino acid  sequences , but the first  <dig> aa at the n-termini show 45% divergence for isotig <dig> and 53% for isotig <dig> . we designate the isoform encoded by isotig <dig> as pfdgat1- <dig> and that encoded by isotig <dig> as pfdgat1- <dig>  lesquerella dgat <dig> is more related to the dgat <dig> from arabidopsis than to that from castor . protein sequence alignment revealed that castor dgat <dig> has additional  <dig> aa at its n-terminus . soluble dgat <dig> is divided into a distinct clade in the phylogeny tree from dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> due to sequence distance . pfdgat <dig> encodes a longer protein  compared with those of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> aa of arabidopsis, castor bean, and peanut dgat <dig>  respectively . protein sequence analysis showed that pfdgat <dig> had 82% identity with atdgat <dig>  even though it has  <dig> more aa .figure  <dig>

it is general accepted that depending on the plant species, dgat <dig> or dgat <dig> is a major enzyme responsible for the accumulation of seed tag  <cit> . dgat <dig> was recently demonstrated to be active in recycling of 18: <dig> and 18: <dig> fas into tag through a cytosolic pathway in peanut  <cit> . our results of gene expression analysis showed that pfdgat1- <dig> and pfdgat1- <dig> had distinct expression patterns. pfdgat1- <dig> was expressed in all stages during seed development and in leaf, stem, and flower bud, but it was expressed more in leaf, stem, and in immature seeds prior to active oil biosynthesis and became a predominant dgat mrna at late-maturation/desiccation stages  . in contrast, pfdgat1- <dig> had expression levels higher in developing seeds than in other tissues such as leaf, stem, root and flower buds . pfdgat1- <dig> may specifically contribute to tag synthesis in seed. indeed, our pfdgat1- <dig> is the same gene as pfdgat1a identified in a lesquerella seed cdna library  <cit>  and found to complement the arabidopsis as <dig> mutant  <cit> . as <dig> had reduced dgat activity and seed oil content due to a deletion in atdgat <dig> gene  <cit> . seed-specific over-expression of an arabidopsis cdna encoding atdgat <dig> not only restored the oil content in as <dig> but also enhanced seed oil content and seed weight in wild-type plants  <cit> . the expression profile of pfdgat <dig> was overall similar to that of pfdgat1- <dig>  except in the late-maturation/desiccation stages where pfdgat <dig> expression dropped to undetectable levels or trace amounts  . the results indicate that both pfdgat1- <dig> and pfdgat <dig> may function in other physiological processes besides seed oil synthesis, and that they clearly contribute differently in lipid metabolism during late-maturation/desiccation stages of seed development. pfdgat <dig> was ubiquitously expressed in all samples and showed a moderate dynamic pattern compared with the other pfdgats. in leaf, stem, flower bud, and developing seeds at early stages , pfdgat <dig> transcripts were detected at levels similar to that of pfdgat1- <dig> . in developing seeds at  <dig> dap, their levels rose 2- to 4-fold before declining steadily at late stages 42- <dig> dap . the boosted expression of pfdgat <dig> may be associated with increasing demands of membrane and storage lipids synthesis at  <dig> dap, when seeds had attained their maximum size and storage compounds have accumulated to a high plateau  <cit> . the temporal and spatial expression pattern of pfdgat <dig> suggests its role of house-keeping in most organs of lesquerella. similar expression profile was reported for dgat <dig> in peanut  <cit> , arbidopsis  <cit>  and tung tree  <cit> . none of these dgat3s were hypothesized to play a significant role in seed oil synthesis; rather it was proposed that they are involved in general tag metabolism. among all samples, root tissue had the lowest number of transcripts of all pfdgats. while it is clear that pfdgat1- <dig> plays a role in seed tag assembly, it remains an open question as to whether or not pfdgat1- <dig>  pfdgat <dig> or pfdgat <dig> also contribute. measurements of enzyme activity and substrate specificity in various tissues are needed to better elucidate the functions of the different pfdgats. the results of such studies combined with our sequence characterization and expression profiling will provide the molecular basis for future identification of pfdgat candidates for genetic engineering oilseeds for hydroxy fatty acid production.

pc-mediated tag synthesis
as described, pc is the substrate for many fa-modifying enzymes . the fa fluxes into and out of pc are crucial for the production of tag esterified with modified fas, such as hfa. based on current knowledge, there are three routes allowing pc-derived fa to be incorporated into tag. first, the fa esterified to pc undergoes constant deacylation and reacylation by lpcat in so called acyl editing  <cit> . thus modified fa released by lpcat can enter kennedy pathway for tag assembly . second, direct transfer by pdat of a fa from the sn- <dig> position of pc to the sn- <dig> position of dag produces tag . third, pdct catalyzes the inter-conversion between dag and pc by phosphocholine head group exchange . thus fa on pc can be incorporated into the sn- <dig> and sn- <dig> positions of tag by the pc derived dag.

recent studies have revealed the roles of the enzymes encoded by arabidopsis lpcat <dig>  and lpcat <dig>  and other plant lpcats genes  <cit> . they suggest that lpcats are responsible for incorporation of newly synthesized fatty acid into pc , and transferring polyunsaturated and hfas produced on pc directly to the acyl-coa pool  for further metabolism or catabolism. when reverse reactions were measured, a ricinoleoyl group at the sn- <dig> position of pc was removed 3- to 6-fold faster than an oleoyl group by seven lpcats from five species tested, including a pflpcat <dig>  <cit> . these results suggest an important role for pflpcats in removing 18:1-oh from sn- <dig> pc to an acyl-coa pool. the mechanism of pc-modified ufas channeled into tag through efficient acyl editing and kennedy pathway has been proposed as one of the major mechanisms that allow efficient assembling of ufa into tags  <cit> . as lesquerella tags contains 55-60% 20:1-oh, it is likely that the acyl editing by pflpcats allows 18:1-oh to be immediately released from pc, activated to 18:1-oh-coa then elongated to 20:1-oh-coa for further incorporation into tag through the kennedy pathway. when temporal and spatial expression patterns of arabidopsis lpcats were investigated using promoter fragments of atlpcats fused with the uida reporter gene encoding ß-glucuronidase , differential expression patterns were observed for atlpcat <dig> and atlpcat <dig>  <cit> . histochemical localization of gus activity in transgenic lines showed that both promoters were active in seedling and rosette leaves. during seed development, atlpcat <dig> promoter activity was detected at a later developmental stage, whereas atlpcat <dig> promoter was active throughout seed development; it was also particularly strong in pollen grains. we have identified ten isotigs of pflpcat <dig> and one isotig of pflpcat <dig> in the lesquerella seed transcriptome, and found high sequence identity between lesquerella and arabidopsis lpcats . our expression profiling data indicate that pflpacts are also differentially expressed . during seed development, pflpcat <dig> showed a linear-rise throughout most stages up to  <dig> dap, and then a sharp drop at  <dig> dap when seeds enter the desiccation stage. the pflpcat <dig> temporal pattern resembles atlpcat <dig>  little expression of pflpcat <dig> was detected in leaf, stem, root and flower bud . unlike pflpcat <dig>  pflpcat <dig> showed high expression during early  dap stages of seed development, medium-high levels from 28- <dig> dap, and then suddenly became undetectable and extremely low at late stages  <dig> and  <dig> dap, respectively . in leaf, stem and root, moderate expression of pflpcat <dig> was detected . in flower bud, pflpcat <dig> was expressed highest among all organs investigated. . the overall expression profile of pflpcat <dig> is similar to that of atlpcat <dig> based on promoter activity analysis  <cit>  and information available at the arabidopsis efp browser  <cit> . our results revealed that both pflpcats were expressed during seed development but with opposite trends. thus, it is likely that both pflpcats contribute to tag metabolism in lesquerella seeds. pflpcat <dig> was highly expressed in flower bud, suggesting its involvement in tag synthesis in pollen.figure  <dig>

pdat was identified and characterized as an acyl-coa-independent transacylase that transfers the fatty acid at the sn- <dig> position in pc to the sn- <dig> position of dag, thus synthesizing tag  <cit> . two pdats were found from arabidopsis, pdat <dig>  and pdat <dig>   <cit> . atpdat <dig> is ubiquitously expressed  <cit> , but atpdat <dig> transcripts are predominantly found in seed  <cit> . together with atdgat <dig>  atpdat <dig> has been shown to determine the amount of tag synthesis in pollen grains and developing seeds, whereas atpdat <dig> does not play a substantial role in tag synthesis, although it is highly expressed during seed development  <cit> . based on homology searches with arabidopsis pdats, we identified a total of  <dig> isotigs of pfpdat transcripts in the lesquerella seed transcriptome. detailed comparison among  <dig> isotigs led to discovery of pfpdat1- <dig>  pfpdat1- <dig>  and pfpdat <dig> . pfpdat1- <dig> is slightly closer to atpdat <dig> than pfpdat1- <dig> . sequence alignments revealed that the 3′-utr’s of pfpdat1- <dig> and pfpdat1- <dig> were distinct . gene expression analysis revealed that pfpdat1- <dig> was ubiquitously expressed in developing seeds at all stages and in other organs examined , similar to the expression pattern of atpdat <dig>  expression levels of pfpdat1- <dig> were about 100-fold higher in developing seeds compared with pfpdat1- <dig>  but were negligible in leaf, stem and root . in flower bud, both pfpdat1- <dig> and pfpdat1- <dig> isoforms were highly expressed at equivalent . the temporal expression of pfpdat <dig> showed an linear rise during seed development up to  <dig> dap, and then a drop to a low level at the latest stage  <dig> dap. the highest level at  <dig> dap is comparable to that of pfpdat1- <dig>  in leaf, stem, root and flower bud, the expression level of pfpdat <dig> was negligible . the role of pdat in hfas synthesis has been well studied in castor by two groups  <cit> , who both found that castor pdats were comprised of three members, rcpdat1- <dig>  <cit>  , rcpdat1- <dig>  <cit>   and rcpdat <dig>  gene expression analysis indicated that rcpdat1-1/rcpdat1b and rcpdat <dig> had profiles similar to those of atpdat <dig> and atpdat <dig>  respectively,  <cit> . however, rcpdat1-2/rcpdat1a was highly expressed in developing castor seeds, and this isoform was not found in arabidopsis. since castor accumulates 90% hfa in seed tag, it has been proposed that the enzyme encoded by rcpdat1-2/rcpdat1a could be important for hfa-tag synthesis. indeed both groups demonstrated that rcpdat1-2/rcpdat1a facilitated the transfer of hfas from pc into tag in transgenic arabidopsis. unlike castor oil which has over 70% of tags esterified with 18:1-oh in all three positions  <cit> , lesquerella tags contain 55-60% 20:1-oh, and majority of them are esterified in sn- <dig> and sn- <dig> positions  <cit> . the lack of hfa at the sn- <dig> of tag could be explained by lpats in lesquerella discriminating 20:1-oh substrate. recent studies of transgenic camelina expressing rcfah <dig> and pfkcs <dig> suggested the mechanism of 20:1-oh in tag assembly mainly utilizing kennedy pathway in lesquerella  <cit> . therefore, pfpdats are unlikely major enzymes channeling hfa into tags. the roles of pfpdats remain to be determined. the gene sequence and expression profile of pfpdats identified in this study provide critical information for future investigation on the enzymatic activity and substrate specificity in acyl-lipid metabolism in lesquerella.figure  <dig>

fatty acids at the sn- <dig> and sn- <dig> positions in pc can be directly transferred to tag through dag converted by pdct. the pdct enzyme, encoded in arabidopsis by the reduced oleate desaturation <dig>  gene, catalyzes the inter-conversion between dag and pc by phosphocholine head group exchange  <cit> . in castor, the 18:1-oh is produced by the hydroxylation of 18: <dig> that is esterified to the sn- <dig> position of pc  <cit> . since pdct catalyzes the shuffling of acyl groups between pc and dag, it provides a mechanism of making hfa-dag from hfa-pc, thus the hfa-dag can be subsequently converted to hfa-tag. a castor pdct enzyme gene was isolated and co-expressed in a transgenic arabidopsis line carrying rcfah <dig>  the doubly transformed line had increases of 17-23% in seed hfa content  <cit> . the authors noted that co-expression of atpdct did not increase hfa in transgenic arabidopsis, indicating that rcpdct had evolved to effectively convert hfa-pc to hfa-dag  <cit> . in the lesquerella seed transcriptome, we have identified one isotig <dig> showing high homology with arabidopsis pdct and have designated it pfpdct. the pfpdct sequence shares 89% and 73% identify with atpdct and rcpdct, respectively . gene expression analysis indicated that pfpdct is expressed ubiquitously in developing seeds and other organs examined . among most samples, the expression levels ranged from 100- <dig> relative copy number, with exception of the seed sample at  <dig> dap and the root sample, which had levels of about  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. a similar expression profile for atpdct was reported  <cit> . it is known that the sn- <dig> position of tag in lesquerella consists almost all of c <dig> unsaturated acyl groups including 18: <dig>  18: <dig> and 18: <dig>  <cit> . thus pfpdct would not be a major enzyme involved in channeling hfa into lesquerella tags. it is possible that pfpdct contributes fa flux through pc-derived dag in tag assembly in lesquerella. however, based on the expression profile of pfpdct, it is likely that pfpdct plays a general house-keeping function in lesquerella acyl-lipid metabolism.

CONCLUSIONS
lesquerella is valued for its unusual hfa in seeds. deep sequencing of cdnas from developing lesquerella seeds was carried out to identify candidate genes that are associated with the synthesis of seed tag enriched with hfa. a total of  <dig>  unique genes from  <dig> mega-base raw sequences were assembled and 74% of them  had homology with known genes. the vast majority  of the matched genes showed highest homology to arabidopsis genes, confirming the close relationship between the two species. the results provide a molecular basis for translating findings from the model plant arabidopsis to facilitate lesquerella crop improvement. genes involved in the synthesis of fa and tag were identified and annotated by detailed sequence alignments. we have identified nearly all of the known genes for de novo fa biosynthesis and export from the plastid, and all of the known genes for tag assembly in er. in addition, we characterized the temporal and spatial expression profiles of  <dig> key genes in tag metabolism using quantitative rt-pcr. the sequence and gene expression data presented in this study will serve as a useful resource for future research on lesquerella and other oilseed crops and promote their development into safe sources of hfa.
