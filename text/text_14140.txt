BACKGROUND
rates of nucleotide substitution for mitochondrial dna  are several times higher than those for nuclear dna  for most animals. several reasons for this difference in rates have been proposed. because mtdna is haploid and usually maternally inherited, the effective population size of mitochondrial genes is one quarter that for nuclear genes, which should speed neutral divergence  <cit> . unlike ndna, mitochondria lack histones, which leaves them exposed to mutagens. furthermore, because mitochondria are centers of oxidative metabolism, mtdna faces more of the free radicals responsible for many mutations than does ndna  <cit> . as a result, intraspecific variation for mtdna may exceed that for ndna  <cit> . this variation is often partitioned among populations, such that surveys of mtdna may reveal population subdivision when other markers such as allozymes do not  <cit> .

yet not all mtdna evolves rapidly. rates of nucleotide substitution are slow in the mtdna of plants, both in absolute terms and relative to ndna  <cit> . rates of mtdna substitution appear to be slow in some basal animals as well, including sponges  <cit>  and anthozoans . this is especially surprising for corals. corals and other anthozoans do not sequester their germ cells  <cit> , yet single coral colonies may live many hundreds of years  <cit> . all else being equal, this combination of a nonsequestered germline and great longevity should lead to high rates of mitochondrial mutation, as any mutations accumulated over a long life could be passed on to offspring.

contrary to this expectation, mtdna divergence among closely related anthozoans is low  <cit> , in fact lower than that for ndna from the same taxa  <cit> . among the few intraspecific studies to survey mitochondrial variation from many  individuals, most have focused on non-coding regions  <cit>  or rrna genes  <cit> . variation in these regions has generally been less than or equal to that for nuclear genes  <cit> .

such non-coding substitution rates are difficult to compare across taxa due to the effects of variation in evolutionary constraints on substitution rates and to difficulties in aligning homologous sites. synonymous  substitutions within coding regions, however, can often be aligned unambiguously among distant taxa. synonymous sites show low variation in rates among different loci in the same genome  <cit> , consistent with their neutral evolution. to date, surveys of mitochondrial coding regions in corals  <cit>  have found little or no variation, but these studies have included just a few individuals  and a few localities , and have not been accompanied by surveys of variation at single-copy nuclear markers.

here, i survey intraspecific variation and estimate the interspecific divergence rate for two species of coral, balanophyllia elegans and tubastrea coccinea, using a widely sequenced mitochondrial coding region from cytochrome c oxidase subunit i . allozyme surveys in b. elegans have previously established that single copy nuclear markers are both variable and subdivided among populations  <cit> . divergence between the two species surveyed allows me to calculate fossil-calibrated rates of synonymous substitution and to place these rates of mtdna substitution in the phylogenetic context of synonymous rates in other eukaryotic lineages

RESULTS
coxi was invariant among all  <dig> b. elegans  sampled from  <dig> populations spanning  <dig> km of its geographic range, including  <dig> individuals from the site  that was most polymorphic for allozymes  <cit> . the seven t. coccinea samples from the caribbean and the eastern pacific were likewise identical at coxi . rate calculations were based on this caribbean/eastern pacific consensus sequence. the five sequences from hawaiian t. coccinea were identical to each other, but differed from the caribbean/eastern pacific consensus sequence by a single nonsynonymous substitution. reading frames for all sequences remain open for all of these sequences when translated using the cnidarianmitochondrial genetic code  <cit> .

the fossil record indicates that balanophyllia and tubastrea diverged at least  <dig> my ago  <cit> , yet raw coxi divergence between b. elegans and t. coccinea is only  <dig> %. the synonymous substitution rate is  <dig>  substitutions per site per my . this rate is the same as that for two angiosperms  that diverged at about the same time as balanophyllia and tubastrea  <cit> . for comparison, diverse animal lineages sundered by the isthmus of panama three my ago show rates of synonymous substitution roughly  <dig> times greater than for angiosperms and corals ; even the notably slow mtdna of sharks  <cit>  is  <dig> times faster. nonsynonymous  substitution rates for corals and plants are similar as well, but are only slightly slower than those bilateral animals .

a rates are in units of % substitutions per site per  <dig> years. ks, synonymous substitutions per synonymous site; ka, nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site. all estimates for fragments of coxi except angiosperms  and sphyrna .

patterns of nucleotide substitution between the two corals are also more similar to angiosperms  <cit>  than to other animals. about half of coral mtdna substitutions are transversions . in contrast, the mtdna of other animals typically shows a strong transition bias  <cit> . for example, the tegula species in table  <dig> show a 15-fold excess of transitions compared to transversions between closely-related species  <cit> .

discussion
low levels of mitochondrial variation in corals
this study revealed little intraspecific variation within either of two corals, balanophyllia elegans or tubastrea coccinea. b. elegans was sampled over much  of its broad geographic range, where high levels of allozyme variation have been found previously  <cit> . the single substitution  observed within t. coccinea mtdna occurred between populations separated by over  <dig> km of uninhabitable ocean. previous surveys of genetic variation in coding regions of coral mtdna have found similar patterns: either no variation  <cit>  or very little variation restricted to nonsynonymous sites  <cit> .

such low levels of genetic variation are not characteristic of anthozoan nuclear genes. indeed, a comparison of allozyme polymorphism and heterozygosity found variation in cnidarians and sponges to be higher than those for all other animals  <cit> . high allozyme heterozygosity in b. elegans  <cit>  shows it is no exception to this trend. intraspecific surveys of ndna sequence variation from coding regions are lacking for corals, but intron sequences are quite variable  <cit> , and microsatellites  <cit>  and aflps  <cit>  have revealed both high heterozygosities and population subdivision. while more extensive surveys of nucleotide variation from coding ndna are needed, low variation appears to be restricted to the mitochondrial genome of corals.

relatively low levels of mtdna variation can result from range expansions, where the smaller effective population size of mtdna genes can enhances founder effects. this may account for the lack of variation between eastern pacific and caribbean t. coccinea, if the latter were indeed recently introduced as suggested by cairns  <cit> . this does not appear to be the case for b. elegans, however. subdivision within this species  <cit>  does not suggest any anthropogenic range changes. natural poleward range expansions following climatic cooling events can homogenize the mtdna of newly founded populations, but more equatorial populations continue to harbor variation  <cit> . sampled populations of b. elegans include its southern range limit, however, but still reveal no variation. selective sweeps can also homogenize mtdna within species. however, mtdna regions are often identical among different species, genera, and even families  <cit> , a pattern that would require very strong stabilizing selection to maintain homogeneity  over millions of years. the most likely explanation of low levels of mtdna variation within coral species, then, is a low rate of nucleotide substitution.

slow rates of synonymous substitution in corals
a growing body of evidence suggests that the mtdna of anthozoans evolves slowly  <cit> . the very low divergence found here for two genera with independent fossil records extending back over  <dig> my provides an estimate of just how slowly:  <dig> % per my. this rate of synonymous substitution is 50â€“ <dig> times slower than those reported previously for an array of animals , including hydrozoans  <cit> .

these low rates have practical consequences. first, the dearth of variation in anthozoan mtdna makes routine phylogeographic surveys impossible. alternative approaches employing microsatellite variation have revealed genetically isolated regions within coral species  <cit> , but primers for single-copy nuclear gene regions that both amplify across diverse taxa and consistently reveal variation within species remain to be developed. second, low variation means that mtdna sequences cannot be counted on to reveal differences between closely related species. indeed, the mtdna region nominated for such dna barcoding  <cit>  is the very same coxi used here. hebert et al.  <cit>  stated previously that barcoding fails in cnidarians due to low variation; figure  <dig> suggests that this limitation applies only to a subset of the cnidaria, the anthozoans. still, low rates of coxi evolution in corals, sea fans, and sponges mean that the very bricks and mortar of tropical reefs are not amenable to barcoding diversity surveys .

multiple losses of mtdna repair function
as with corals, the available data for fungi  <cit>  and sponges  <cit>  suggest that rates of synonymous substitution in mtdna are slower than ndna in these taxa. taken together with rates for plants and animals, these data suggest that mtdna evolves in two distinct modes: one slow relative to ndna and with little bias toward transitions, the other fast relative to ndna and often  transition-biased . phylogenetic analysis suggests that the switch from the slow mode to the fast mode occurs abruptly  and always in the direction toward the fast mode. this switch has occurred at least four times: twice in flowering plants , and twice in animals .

one change in animals occurred within the phylum cnidaria between the basal anthozoa  <cit>  and the derived medusozoa . the independently derived fast mtdna rates in the medusozoa are similar to those in bilateral animals. in fact, 16s divergence rates in hydroids of the genus hydractinia  <cit>  are greater that of their hermit crab hosts  <cit> , with whom they have probably co-speciated  <cit> ). phylogenetic analyses reveal interspecific variation typical for most animals among recent radiations of scyphozoans  <cit> . scyphozoans also have high levels of intraspecific variation  <cit>  and show a transition:transversion bias > 10: <dig> . a second switch from slow to fast mtdna occurred at the base of the bilateria ; even flatworms show high intraspecific mtdna variation and a strong transition bias  <cit> .

this qualitative switch in the mode of mtdna evolution is not a simple extension of the quantitative variation in mtdna rates noted previously  <cit> . within vertebrates, relative substitution rates in mtdna and ndna are correlated within taxa, despite variation in absolute rates among taxa  <cit> . even in bilateral animals with notably slow mutation rates , the rate of mitochondrial substitution remains faster than that for nuclear loci. in contrast, the relative rates of substitution in mtdna and ndna are reversed in angiosperms, fungi, anthozoans, and probably sponges  when compared to bilateral animals .

no attribute of the mitochondrial genome itself correlates obviously with slow, unbiased evolution. for example, anthozoan mtdna has group i introns  <cit>  like some plants and fungi, but is compact in size  like most other animals  <cit> . instead, the abrupt and unidirectional switch from slow to fast modes of mtdna substitution is consistent with the sudden loss of one or a few mitochondrion-specific dna repair or replication genes. a possible candidate gene has been proposed previously to account for low variation in anthozoans  <cit> : an ortholog of the mismatch repair gene msh <dig> . msh <dig> is known to be mitochondrion-specific in yeast  <cit> , and is present in the mitochondrial genome of octocorallian anthozoans  <cit>  but missing from the bilateral animals whose genomes have been sequenced. loss of any of the many genes involved in repair  <cit>  could potentially speed synonymous substitution rates. note also that the mitochondrial location of the putative msh <dig> homolog in octocorallians is exceptional; msh <dig> is not present in the mitochondrial genome of corals  <cit> , and mitochondrion-specific repair genes are generally encoded in the nuclear genome.

regardless of the particular genes responsible, a loss of mtdna-specific repair function  could explain observed low levels of mtdna variation and divergence compared to nuclear genes. differences in the fidelity of mtdna repair and replication could have broad implications. if mutations to mtdna caused by oxidative stress promote cellular aging  <cit>  and organismal senescence  <cit> , then the loss of mtdna repair abilities may place a physiological ceiling on longevity. exploring this possibility will require phylogenetic comparisons of covariation in synonymous rates of substitution in mtdna and patterns of senescence, as well as closer examination of the molecular mechanisms of mtdna replication and repair across slow and fast mitochondrial lineages.

CONCLUSIONS
both of the corals surveyed here showed low variation in mitochondrial coding gene sequence, despite the demonstration of extensive nuclear gene variation at allozymes in one of them previously. combined with other types of nuclear variation  and phylogenetic studies reported previously, these results suggest that the lack of variation in coral mtdna results from mechanisms specific to the mitochondrial genome. synonymous substitution rates suggest coral mtdna evolves at rates typical for plants, but about  <dig> times slower than for most animals.
