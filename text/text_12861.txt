BACKGROUND
ostrinia nubilalis  and sesamia nonagrioides  are two maize stem borers which cause important losses in temperate maize production. ecb is present in united states and central and south europe, while sesamia nonagrioides  is restricted to mediterranean areas, including south europe, north africa and middle east  <cit> . larvae feed on the stem, producing tunnels that weaken the plant and, as consequence, stalk lodging is increased and yield reduced. furthermore, larvae can also feed directly on the ear which promotes infections by fusarium spp at levels that may affect human and animal health  <cit> . although the type of damage caused by the two species is similar, mcb larvae are more voracious and produce more damage than ecb larvae  <cit> . phenotypic evaluations for resistance to ecb and mcb suggest that maize has common mechanisms of resistance to both pests  <cit> .

several studies have been carried out to map genetic factors for resistance to ecb tunnelling  <cit> , but only one qtl analysis for resistance to mcb tunnelling has been reported so far  <cit> . the two qtls for mcb resistance detected were located close to qtls for ecb resistance which could indicate the presence of gene clusters or common mechanisms of resistance to different pests. however, more qtl experiments for resistance to mcb are needed to confirm the co-localization of qtls for resistance to both pests. the search for qtls rather should be done with no previously prospected maize materials than with materials extensively studied such as those derived from b <dig>  <cit>  in order to likely increase the number of known genomic regions involved in borer resistance, as, in general, different subsets of qtls can segregate in different populations  <cit> .

significant variation for resistance to ecb and mcb was found in the european union maize landrace core collection and some populations from central and eastern spain seemed to be promising sources of resistance to maize stem borers, that is, those populations probably carry favourable alleles for ecb or mcb resistance  <cit> . consequently, the use of mapping populations derived from these european materials could allow to widen the already known genomic regions for corn borer resistance.

additive effects have been consistently reported as more important than dominant effects for stalk tunnelling by mcb  <cit> , while additive and dominant effects has been reported as important for mcb ear resistance and yield under infestation  <cit> . it is interesting to mention that stalk tunnel length, the character typically used to quantify corn borer damage, is negatively correlated with yield  <cit> , although the genetic mechanism responsible of that relationship, whether pleitropy or repulsion linkage, is unknown. a population of recombinant inbred lines  is a useful tool for mapping qtls for traits under additive control because rils represent a permanent sample of progenies for evaluations using replications in different environments.

most inbreds used in temperate zones derive from corn belt dent varieties, but adapted flint lines derived from european populations are also widely used, particularly, in europe, northern areas of north america, and japan  <cit> . a heterotic pattern widely used by western european breeders is corn belt dent × european flint  <cit>  using preferentially materials from the still stalk synthetic because the stiff stalk synthetic subgroup shows more heterosis with european flint than other corn belt dent subgroups  <cit> . a population of rils derived from two european flint lines will be used to address the objectives:  to estimate the genetic correlations between mcb resistance and agronomic traits;  to identify and characterize qtls responsible for mcb resistance and agronomic traits within the european flint group.

RESULTS
ep <dig> had higher stalk tunnel length than ep <dig>  while ep <dig> × ep <dig> had a value close to the mid-parent value . in contrast to stem resistance, ep <dig> × ep <dig> had higher level of ear resistance than the most resistance parent. the average value of the rils was close to the mid-parent value for several traits, either agronomic or related to resistance. genetic variances in the ril population were highly significant for all traits, while the genotype × environment interaction variances were highly significant for agronomic traits, but not for resistance traits, except for cob damage.

estimates of means ± standard deviation, as well as of variance components were obtained for several agronomic and resistance traits after evaluation in two environments under artificial infestation with corn borer eggs

a kernel, shank and cob damages were estimated on a  <dig> point scale 

** variance component was significant at the  <dig>  probability level

regarding the agronomic traits, a negative genetic correlation coefficient between flowering and yield was found among rils, while a positive genetic correlation coefficient was found between flowering and grain humidity . regarding the relationship between agronomic and resistant traits, plant height and flowering had a positive and moderate genetic relationship with stalk tunnel length.

the phenotypic correlation coefficients are shown above the diagonal while the genetic correlation coefficients are shown below the diagonal. the correlation coefficients were obtained after evaluation in two environments under artificial selection with corn borer eggs

a at = anthesis, s = silking, ph = plant height, h = grain humidity, y = yield, stl = stalk tunnel length, rstl = relative stalk tunnel length, sdr = shank damage rating, cdr = cob damage rating.

* phenotypic correlation was significant at the  <dig>  probability level.

the genetic map had a total length of  <dig> cm and an average distance between loci of about  <dig> cm . in the rils, three qtls were detected for stalk tunnel length at chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . those qtls explained 33% of the genetic variance, calculated with the whole data set, but this value was reduced to  <dig> % when the cross validation method was used. the additive values for the qtls varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm and both parents contributed with favourable alleles. the qtl at bin  <dig>  was also related to relative stalk tunnel length. concerning ear resistance traits, one qtl was detected for cob damage rate with a lod score lower than  <dig> and a validation frequency lower than 30%.

e cob damage was estimated on a  <dig> point scale 

in the rils, we also detected  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> qtls for silking, plant height, kernel humidity, and yield, respectively . for these traits, the percentage of genetic variance explained by the qtls, calculated in the whole data set, varied from  <dig> to 45%. however, the percentages of genetic variance explained by the qtls were much lower when they were calculated by cross validation. the qtl for silking at bin  <dig>  is remarkable because it explains 29% of the phenotypic variance. this qtl was detected for silking in the 92% of the cv/g runs, indicating a great precision in the location. a qtl for yield at bin  <dig>  was located near a qtl related to stalk tunnel length and relative stalk tunnel length. a qtl for plant height and grain humidity was found at bin  <dig>  and explained 16% of the phenotypic variance, approximately, for each trait. for both traits, the qtl was detected with great precision . for silking, each parent contributed with favourable alleles to half of the qtls, while for yield, the favourable alleles for most qtls came from ep <dig>  ep <dig> also provided the allele that increased the trait for the qtl related to plant height and kernel humidity.

discussion
as expected from previous experiments  <cit>  ep <dig> was resistant, while ep <dig> was susceptible to mcb stalk tunnelling. the value of ep <dig> × ep <dig> for stalk tunnel length was close to the mid-parent value which suggests that additive effects were more important than dominant effects. this is in concordance with previous experiments in which the dominant effects were not significant, except for one single cross  <cit> . contrarily to stalk tunnel length, the hybrid was more ear resistant than the most resistant line indicating that dominant effects would also play an important role, in agreement with results reported by cartea et al.  <cit>  and velasco et al.  <cit> . similarly, the ep <dig> × ep <dig> hybrid exhibited a considerable degree of heterosis for most agronomic traits. although both parental lines did not differ for many traits, the significant genetic variation found among rils for all traits, except for kernel damage, showed that this population is a valuable material to detect qtls among european germplasm, especially for mcb resistance. the lack of significant rils × environment interaction for stalk tunnel length is in agreement with previous research  <cit> .

plant height was highly and significantly correlated to a resistance trait, such as stalk tunnel length. this result is in agreement with the result reported by schon et al.  <cit> , but not with results obtained by other authors  <cit> . this suggests that the genetic relationship between both traits depends on the germplasm being evaluated.

the  <dig> qtls for stalk tunnelling by mcb detected in this study did not overlap with the qtls for stalk tunnelling by mcb detected in the intermated b <dig> × mo <dig> population  <cit> . differences due to genetic heterogeneity or sampling limited number of progeny could explain the lack of coincidence between two particular qtl experiments. on the contrary, the qtls for stalk tunnelling detected in the present study were in the same or adjacent bins to qtls for stalk tunnelling by ecb consistently detected in other experiments  <cit> . the coincidence of the three qtl locations in experiments carried out with genetically diverse maize populations and with different corn borer species indicates the importance of those genomic regions for corn borer resistance across corn borer species and maize populations. the resistance mechanisms of maize to ecb or mcb attack at early stages of plant development are probably based on toxins, for example dimboa, but, based on structural compounds, particularly cell wall composition, later on  <cit> . cell wall characteristics may affect insect feeding due to different reasons: elevated levels of indigestible fiber may increase the bulk density of the diet to the point that insect are unable to ingest sufficient quantities of nutrients and water  <cit> , and/or lignified cell walls may produce tougher tissues that are more resistant to the tearing action of mandibles  <cit> . qtls for mcb stalk tunnelling detected in this experiment at bins  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  were close to qtls for stalk strength or cell wall compounds detected in other experiments, suggesting that genes involved in the synthesis of cell wall compounds in maize could be good candidate genes for resistance to corn borers. thus, flint-garcia et al.  <cit>  detected only one qtl for stalk strength in common across four populations which is approximately located in bin  <dig> . regarding cell wall main components, qtls for neutral detergent fiber , acid detergent fiber , acid detergent lignin  and hemicellulose were detected in bins  <dig> / <dig> ,  <dig> / <dig>  and  <dig> / <dig>   <cit> . in addition, barriere et al.  <cit>  found cell wall-bound phenolic compounds  to be associated to the three genomic regions, particularly to bin  <dig> / <dig> . silage corn digestibility for dairy cattle is related to cell wall characteristics  <cit>  and therefore probably related to maize resistance to corn borers too. thus, qtls for silage corn digestibility were also detected in bins  <dig> / <dig>  and  <dig> / <dig>   <cit> . furthermore, out of the five expression qtl  hotspots for silage corn digestibility detected by shi et al.  <cit> , the two main ones were in bins  <dig>  and  <dig> . the eqtl hotspot on bin  <dig>  was co-localized with a qtl for cell wall digestibility, concluding the authors that the gene underlying qtl and eqtl are identical.

in the region of bin  <dig>  approximately  <dig> protein-coding genes of rice and sorghum aligned to maize genome http://www.plantgdb.org/zmgdb/displaygeneann.php?ds=&q=. for that reason, the isogenization-assisted by molecular markers - of the qtl could narrow its interval and facilitate the clonation of genes. however, we propose some candidate genes according to the hypothesis that genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis or fortification confer also resistance to corn borers. candidate genes for stem tunnelling were selected from the gene expression data repertory of cell wall biosynthesis and assembly in maize contained in maizewall http://www.polebio.scsv.ups-tlse.fr/maizewall/index.html, the genes located in those qtl regions. we have found in the region  <dig>  three genes from the phenyhlpropanoid pathway which is the pathway that controls the biosynthesis of monolignols, the monomers of lignins  <cit> . these genes are: a peroxidase , a laccase , and a p-coumarate-3-hydroxylase  . in addition to the maizewall repertory of genes, we also searched in maizegdb for genes related to cell wall biosynthesis located at the qtls' regions. in bin  <dig>  lies a gene that codifies for the sucrose phosphate synthase  <dig> enzyme  which is involved in cellulose biosynthesis  <cit> . the lax midrib <dig> gene which affects the midrib portion of the leaf  <cit>  is also in the region . inbred lines of maize with lax midribs have lower levels of fiber, lignin and xylose and are more digestible than 'normal' inbreds  <cit> . the five genes at bin  <dig>  constitute possible candidate genes for resistance to stalk tunneling that could be validated by an association study  <cit> .

for stalk tunnel length the proportion of genotypic variance explained by the qtls following cross validation in our experiment was similar to that found by papst et al.  <cit>  and ordas et al.  <cit> . given the low number of detected qtl and the small proportion of genotypic variance explained, it is likely that the trait be regulated by many qtl of small effect. therefore, according to different qtl experiments, for resistance to corn borer tunnelling the theoretical expectation of the efficacy of mas for increasing resistance to corn borers is low and it can be concluded that mas seems not promising. however, the genomic regions related to resistance to corn borer detected in this and others qtl experiments are useful as start points for fine mapping in order to address, in the future, the cloning of genes related to resistance. regarding the utility of the qtls for maize breeding, we evaluated a sample of  <dig> of the rils crossed to a tester  in two different sowing dates in the same location and year , and no qtls for resistance were found in the testcross population.

we found, consistently with a previous experiment with mcb  <cit> , that mcb produce higher tunnels length than ecb  <cit> . in both experiments with mcb we found less qtls for stalk tunnelling,  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, than the average number of qtls reported for ecb stalk tunneling that ranged from six to nine  <cit> . as argued by ordas et al.  <cit> , it is possible that, due to the aggressiveness of the insect, most genotypes seem to be susceptible, although some of them carry a low level of resistance. this is in agreement with the phenotypic performance of the two parents and the segregation among rils.

regarding the agronomic traits, the major qtl for flowering time detected at bin  <dig>  is located within a consensus region of major effect  <cit>  with at least two different qtls: vgt <dig>  recently cloned by salvi et al.  <cit>  and vgt <dig>  <cit> . the confidence interval of this qtl for flowering time overlapped with the confidence interval of a qtl for yield. as the allele that increased flowering time decreased yield, the co-localization of the two qtls could partially explain the significant and negative genetic correlations between flowering time and yield that we found. the qtl for plant height at bin  <dig>  was consistently found in different genetic backgrounds and environments  <cit> . the confidence interval of this qtl overlapped with the confidence interval of the qtl for stalk tunnel length, agreeing with a previous experiment  <cit> . furthermore, in both experiments the allele associated to increased damage was also associated to increased plant height. the co-localization of the two qtls, for plant height and stalk tunnel length, could contribute to the positive genetic correlation between both traits detected in this experiment. the confidence interval of the qtl for yield at bin  <dig>  overlapped with the confidence interval of a qtl for stalk tunnel length and relative stalk tunnel length. both the allele for decreased yield and the allele for increased stalk resistance were provided by the same line and, therefore, if the qtl would be used for increasing resistance to corn borers by mas, a negative effect on yield could be expected. a negative relationship between resistance and yield was also found in selection programs in which the yield decreased as an indirect consequence of selecting for increased resistance  <cit> . however, it is not possible to know if the co-localization of qtls for different traits is due to linkage between different genes or pleitropism of a single gene.

CONCLUSIONS
we detected three genomic regions involved in resistance to stalk tunnelling by mcb that were close to genomic regions related to resistance to stalk tunnelling by ecb detected in genetically different populations. this indicates the importance of those genomic regions across corn borer species and maize populations. our results, when compared with results from other authors, suggest that genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis or fortification could be good candidate genes for the qtls detected for stem tunnelling in our experiment. particularly, we proposed five candidate genes related to cell wall characteristics which could explain the qtl for stalk tunnelling at bin  <dig> . the small proportion of genotypic variance explained by the qtls suggest that there are also many other genes of small effect regulating stem tunnelling by mcb. therefore, we conclude that mas seems not promising for this trait, although the genomic regions consistently detected are useful as starting points for the cloning of genes related to resistance. two of the qtls detected for stalk tunnelling overlap with qtls for agronomic traits, indicating the presence of pleitropism or linkage between genes.
