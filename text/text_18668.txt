BACKGROUND
osteoblasts are responsible for bone matrix production and mineralization  <cit> . in concert with osteoclasts, osteoblasts coordinate bone remodeling, a physiologic process by which bone mass is maintained  <cit> . osteoblasts arise from mesenchymal stem cells   <cit> . however, the mechanism controlling this differentiation process is not well understood.

msc differentiation to osteoblasts can be induced both in vivo and in vitro by soluble factors in the bone morphogenetic protein family   <cit> . among the bmps, bmp <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are the best characterized osetogenic factors  <cit> . our previous work  <cit>  has shown that:  human msc produce bmp <dig> in defined, serum-free conditions,  bmp <dig> is up-regulated under mild osteogenic stimulus ,  exogenous bmp <dig> potently induces osteoblast differentiation, but responses to bmp <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> are inconsistent and require higher doses,  exogenous bmp <dig> induces the expression or up-regulation of a set of osteoblast-related genes in human msc, and   <dig> hour treatment with bmp <dig> induce high levels of osteoblast gene expression and cause mineralization. these results established bmp <dig> as an endogenous regulator of human osteoblast differentiation  <cit> .

unfortunately, bmp <dig> signaling largely remains uncharacterized. significant efforts, particularly a series of high throughput microarray studies  <cit>  have been undertaken to uncover bmp  responsive genes, transcriptional programs, and their roles in osteoblast development. however, an integrated understanding of the regulatory mechanisms for osteoblast differentiation and mineralization has not been achieved. in particular, two remaining questions include:  what pathways and gene groups are responsible for msc differentiation to osteoblasts in response to bmp <dig> stimulation?  what is the sequence of pathway activation events in response to bmp <dig> during the osteogenic induction?

to answer these two questions, we conducted a time series microarray study on bmp <dig> osteogenic induction and a comprehensive pathway analysis on the temporal data. we met special challenges at both experiment and data analysis levels.

at experiment level, we considered two major issues. first, what rate to sample the time series? the time intervals should be short enough to capture the dynamics and continuity, but long enough to show phenotypically significant changes. we determined time intervals based on the minimal bmp <dig> treatment durations needed for significant phenotypic changes, including the expression of osteoblast markers and formation of mineralized extracellular matrix . second, given that osteoblast induction is a temporal process with accumulative effects and gradual changes, how to dissect out the net effect of bmp <dig> at different phenotypic stages? we employed a bmp <dig> addition-and-withdrawal scheme .

at data analysis level, we developed a novel temporal pathway analysis procedure. gene set analysis  is a well established strategy to identify pathways or gene sets associated with a particular phenotype or condition  <cit> . temporary analysis was done on biological processes previously  <cit> . however, traditional gsa methods do not directly apply without externally specified selection criteria for temporal changes. methods like gsea  <cit>  accept continuous phenotype labels hence can correlate gene set changes to time or pre-defined temporal patterns. to our knowledge, these methods do not infer temporal pathway level changes without reference patterns. for such temporal pathway analysis to be practical, a method needs to be:  applicable to datasets with small or even changing sample size at each time point or condition.  both sensitive and selective to capture subtle yet real regulatory signals over time. to meet these challenges, we designed a special analysis procedure  based on our newly developed gage  method  <cit> .

using this joint experimental and computational approach, we identified both the pathways and their temporal responses to bmp <dig> signaling during osteoblast differentiation and mineralization.

RESULTS
following our previous study  <cit> , we explored bmp <dig> induced human msc osteoblast gene expression and function. our preliminary experiments showed that  <dig> hours bmp <dig> exposure was sufficient to induce expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes in human mscs. a minimum of  <dig> hours exposure was required to form mineralized matrix at  <dig> days after the initiation of bmp treatment. a maximal mineralization response was observed upon  <dig> hours of bmp <dig> treatment.

we designed a microarray study to explore the regulatory mechanisms underneath these phenotypic changes at different stages of human msc osteoblast differentiation . our recently developed gage method  <cit>  was applied to infer the significantly perturbed kegg  pathways, go  term groups, and experimentally derived gene sets  by bmp <dig> treatment at different times along the induction process . we examined these significant gene sets in details below.

significantly perturbed kegg pathways during bmp <dig> osteogenic induction
we observed a single set of kegg pathways that were significantly perturbed at the gene expression level throughout the bmp <dig> induction process . this result suggests that these regulatory mechanisms are constantly involved at different stages of bmp <dig> induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. to test whether a kegg pathway are significantly associated with a phenotype or a sample condition, we account for gene expression level perturbation in both directions , because a pathway commonly includes both positive and negative effectors and local feedback loops to keep the system in balance  <cit> . therefore, we refer to a kegg pathway as significantly perturbed rather than activated or inhibited as a whole.

literature findings and experimental evidence suggest regulatory roles of these kegg pathways in bmp <dig> induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization.

these significant kegg pathways show different temporal perturbation patterns . the tgf-beta signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and wnt signaling pathway are most perturbed at 8h. the jak-stat signaling pathway, mapk signaling pathway and p <dig> signaling pathway are most perturbed at 24h. focal adhesion and ecm-receptor interaction are most perturbed at 10d.

we explored the pattern of differential gene expression induced by bmp <dig> treatment in three representative pathways in detail . first, tgf-beta signaling pathway is the top significant pathway  at 8h and is most perturbed  also at 8h. therefore, this pathway is likely triggered directly by bmp <dig> treatment, and could be the signal initiating the osteoblast differentiation. this role of tgf-beta signaling is consistent with previous work  <cit>  and the common sense: bmp <dig> as a canonical bmp triggers canonical bmp signaling, which is one major branch of tgf-beta signaling pathway. second, focal adhesion is the most significant pathway  after 24h and is most perturbed  at  <dig> days. this pathway is likely the convergence point of the regulatory signals, and it is associated with late stage osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. these results are consistent with the role of focal adhesion inferred from experimental work in the literature  <cit> . third, the mapk signaling pathway is the most perturbed at 24h or the middle stage of differentiation, which suggests that this pathway is likely an intermediate step during the bmp <dig> induced signal relay process at gene expression level. indeed, mapks have been reported to mediate bmp effect during osteoblast differentiation  <cit> . the temporal perturbation patterns in other significant pathways suggest their functions in the bmp <dig> induction process, which are supported by both observations in the literature and evidence from the expression data . the temporal roles assigned to the pathways are relative, because all these pathways are important throughout bmp <dig> induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization .

interestingly, the significant kegg pathways are not distinct but rather act as an integrated super regulatory system. they interconnect to each other as shown on kegg pathway graphs . for example, the tgf-beta pathway triggers the mapk signaling pathway , whereas mapk signaling pathway connects to focal adhesion . these pathways also share common downstream response processes including apoptosis, cell cycle etc . using the top kegg pathways inferred by gage  <cit> , gene expression data and connections between pathways from linkdb module of kegg databases  <cit> , we created an integrated dynamic network view of pathways in figure  <dig>  the upstream nodes including tgf-beta signaling pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction are most perturbed at the early stage. downstream nodes including focal adhesion and ecm-receptor interaction are most perturbed at the late stage. midstream nodes including mapk signaling and p <dig> signaling are most perturbed at the middle stage. these sequential perturbation patterns across interconnected pathways suggest a dynamic transmission process of the regulatory signals induced by bmp <dig> treatment at the transcriptional level.

the connected significant pathways  often share component genes that are evidently perturbed in expression . particularly, overlaps between significant kegg pathways  are consistent with the connections between pathways : high overlaps  almost always suggest direct connections between pathways , and vise versa. overlapping component genes serve as bridges across these relatively independent functional modules or pathways, hence perturbation in one pathway such as the bmp-tgf-beta signaling pathway can be propagated throughout other relevant pathways. these data suggest that these significant kegg pathways work together as an integrated regulatory system.

for each cell in the table, in the parenthesis is the number of perturbed member genes overlapping between the significant kegg pathways; outside is the significance of this overlap between kegg pathways. details of overlap analysis are given in methods section. full names for these kegg pathways are: tgf-beta signaling pathway , cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction , wnt signaling pathway , mapk signaling pathway , jak-stat signaling pathway , p <dig> signaling pathway , focal adhesion , ecm-receptor interaction .

significantly perturbed go term gene sets during bmp <dig> osteogenic induction
in contrast to the top kegg pathways, the top significant go term gene sets change with time . most relevant go term gene sets are significantly up or down regulated only for part of the induction process, except for the notch signaling pathway and insulin-like growth factor receptor binding. in contrast to the kegg pathways, where we test for two-directional perturbations, we test for one-directional changes in go term gene sets as a complementary analysis to the kegg pathway analysis above. more details are described in the methods section. additional file  <dig> includes comprehensive lists of significant kegg pathways and go groups at different time points.

temporal perturbation patterns , supportive literature and experimental evidence all suggest the regulatory roles of these go terms in bmp <dig> induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization.

the top go term gene sets suggest novel yet plausible regulatory processes involved in bmp <dig> induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. some go terms are self-explaining, including skeletal development and ossification . other less evident top go terms are supported by the literature . for example, the notch signaling pathway  is directly involved in bmp <dig> induced osteoblast differentiation  <cit> , suggesting a possible connection to bmp <dig> too. both insulin-like growth factor receptor binding and insulin-like growth factor binding  suggest that the igf signal is important for osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. indeed igf <dig>  <cit>  and igf1r  <cit>  promote mineralization and bone formation, whereas igfbp 3- <dig>  <cit>  sequesters igf <dig> and inhibits osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. direct connections between immune response  and bone formation and metabolism have been well appreciated  <cit> , which merge into a new research area, osteoimmunology  <cit> . genes from homophilic cell adhesion  <cit>  and oxidoreductase activity  <cit>   sets play a role in osteoblast differentiation. selenium  deficiency is associated with osteoporosis  <cit> , a disease in bone formation and metabolism.

significantly perturbed experimentally derived gene sets during bmp <dig> osteogenic induction
our analysis also identified the most significantly up or down-regulated experimental sets during bmp <dig> induction. experimental sets are gene groups coregulated or coexpressed in certain chemical or genetic perturbation experiments from the literature. a significant experiment set suggests that their common regulator was perturbed in our experiment too. there are commonly multiple experimental sets describing the same perturbation or mapping to the same regulatory mechanism. a non-redundant subset of the top experimental sets were collected in table  <dig> with their perturbation patterns shown in figure  <dig>  similar to gene sets based on go terms but not to those on kegg pathways, experimental sets were tested for perturbations in only one direction, either up- or down- regulated  <cit> .

temporal perturbation patterns, supportive literature works and extra experimental evidences all suggest the regulatory roles of these experimental sets in bmp <dig> induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. experimental sets came from msigdb  <cit>  c <dig> collection, where the original names for these significant gene sets are: lei_myb_regulated_genes, baf57_bt549_dn, baf57_bt549_up;  der_ifnb_up, vegf_mmmec_6hrs_up, irs_ko_adip_up .

myb transcription factor is identified as a novel regulator for osteoblast differentiation. myb target gene set was down regulated at 8h, 24h and 10d with no change in myb expression level. myb transcriptional activity at protein level can be inhibited through two potential mechanisms following bmp <dig> treatment: the activation of wnt signaling pathways  phosphorylates and degrades of myb protein  <cit> , and bmp/tgf-beta and wnt responsive ovol <dig> antagonizes transcriptional activation of myb by competing for target promoter binding  <cit> .

another novel transcriptional regulator for osteoblast differentiation we predicted is baf <dig>  which is the regulatory subunit swi/snf chromatin remodeling complex  <cit> . multiple baf <dig> target genes are directly related to osteoblast differentiation and function . indeed, swi/snf regulates osteoblast-specific transcription through chromatin structure modification  <cit> . bmp <dig> treatment may target swi/snf to nucleus though smad <dig> signal  <cit>  or p <dig> mapk pathway targets swi-snf chromatin-remodeling complex  <cit> . interestingly, baf <dig> positive target genes are up-regulated and negative targets down-regulated during bmp <dig> induction, which further confirms the involvement of baf <dig> activity. the different timing of the positive and negative regulation likely suggests different dynamics of these actions.

other interesting regulatory mechanisms are inferred based on the top ranking experimental sets . interferon beta  positive target gene sets are down-regulated, which is consistent with jak-stat pathway from kegg . vegf positive targets are down-regulated, likely because vegf gene expression is down-regulated due to myb inhibition  <cit> . irs negative targets are down-regulated is consistent with activation of igf signal, particularly up-regulation of igf receptor binding proteins .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
this is the first high throughput microarray study on bmp <dig> induced transcriptional program in human msc. it covers the whole process from early to late stage osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. we conducted a comprehensive gene set analysis to identify relevant regulatory mechanisms and functional groups. we inferred a series of significant kegg pathways, go terms and experimental sets at different stages of bmp <dig> induction process. we not only showed which pathways or gene sets are significant, but also when and how they are involved in the osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. different from common pathway analyses  <cit> , our work further captures the interconnections among individual pathways or functional groups and integrate them into a whole system. taken together, this work provides clearer mechanistic picture of osteoblast differentiation and function.

we inferred novel and coherent sets of regulatory mechanisms downstream of bmp <dig> signaling during osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. first, the same set of kegg pathways are constantly involved in bmp <dig> induction. their roles in osteogenic induction are clarified based on their perturbation patterns and connected to relevant discoveries in literature. these significant kegg pathways are not separated but rather they work as a unified super regulatory system, and the pathway perturbation patterns we derived reflect a dynamic transmission process of the regulatory signal at transcriptional level along the super system. second, a varying set of go processes and functional groups are involved at different stage of bmp <dig> induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. these suggest novel yet plausible regulatory mechanisms, which are connected to but have not directly and explicitly introduced in literature works. third, the most significant experimental sets suggest novel transcriptional regulators including myb and baf <dig>  and regulatory pathways consistent with predictions based on kegg and go gene sets above.

connections between kegg pathways are evident as shown in the super regulatory network of pathways . perturbations propagate along the super network at two levels: at protein level, the phosphorylation, binding, activation/inhibition events relay along pathways and transmit into interconnected pathways, as stated by kegg graphs ; at transcriptional level, gene expression perturbation propagates through auto-regulatory  loops within pathways, and bridges into its neighbor pathways through the multiple component genes in common, as suggested by our pathway analysis results . protein level transmission is faster, but transcriptional level transmission lasts longer hence ensure the long term biological effects. these longer lasting transcriptional effects are clearly evident in our data as the gene expression levels were perturbed long after the withdrawal of bmp <dig> treatment. the hard wired kegg pathways and interconnections between them define how bmp <dig> signal triggers downstream programs .

there are also connections between bmp <dig> signal and the processes/groups represented by go terms and experimental sets. for example, notch signal and igf signal are involved in the whole induction process  like all significant kegg pathways . it follows that these two signals should be also part of the super regulatory system and interconnected with multiple significant kegg pathways of the network . this hypothesis is well supported by our data and literature:  notch signal directly interacts with bmp signal. smad <dig> and nic synergize to induce expression of hey <dig> and other notch targets  <cit> . indeed up-regulation of hey <dig>  requires continued bmp <dig> treatment by  <dig> hours . besides this binding-synergy at protein level, notch ligand jag <dig> expression is also up-regulated directly by bmp <dig> . notch also interacts with wnt signal  <cit> .  growth hormone  signal  <cit>  as part of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction  and jak-stat pathways  are activated and by bmp signal  with ghr up-regulated , gh signal up-regulates  and activates igf signal in turn  <cit> . connections between bmp signal and the two predicted transcriptional regulators, myb and baf <dig>  are described above in the results.

when examined together, we find a consistent picture emerging from the lists of significant kegg pathways, go terms, and experimental sets. for example, kegg focal adhesion and ecm receptor interaction pathways , go homophilic cell adhesion  and extracellular matrix structural constituent  groups consistently show the relevance of cell adhesion and extracellular matrix in osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. go immune response groups  echoes kegg cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway . similarly, significant experimental target genes sets  closely reflected changes in the regulatory kegg pathways  or go processes/groups .

interestingly, there are discrepancies among the clustering and the significant kegg pathways, go terms, and experimental sets. for example, notch signaling is defined as both a kegg pathway and a go process. this kegg pathway is not significant  but this go process is . this discrepancy arises from two sources:  different definitions, i.e. kegg pathways contain partially different set of genes from corresponding go processes. while kegg pathways tend to cover the whole homeostatic signal transmission systems even across multiple transcriptional cycles, go usually covers one or multiple discrete steps or functional groups for a process. kegg and go definitions can be considered complementary and both provide valuable gene sets for our analysis.  gage  <cit>  treats kegg pathways and go term gene sets differently: genes under a go term are taken as a group coregulated towards a single direction, either all up or all down regulated, whereas genes in a kegg pathway are frequently not coregulated and expression changes in both directions are counted. timing discrepancies exist between experimental sets and corresponding kegg pathways. for example, ifn positive target sets  are not significant at 24- <dig> hours and myb target set not at  <dig> hours  while jak-stat pathway and wnt signaling pathway are significantly perturbed all the time . this can be explained by the fact that two-directional perturbation treatment for kegg pathway does not account for direction or net effect of the perturbation, whether inhibited, activated or no overall effect. in the other hand, go term analysis has no such issue, and irs negative set and corresponding go igf receptor binding group are both significant all the time.

in this work, we took a systems approach in studying msc differentiation. we combined experimental and computational work to reconstruct a unified picture of bmp <dig> signaling. the same set of experimental design and computational approach could be used to study other physiological and pathological processes, such as the differentiation of other cell types or tumorogenesis.
