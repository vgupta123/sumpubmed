BACKGROUND
major histocompatibility complex  class i molecules have important roles in presenting antigens to immune cells thereby enabling the organism to discriminate between self and non-self. in humans, the mhc genomic region is a gene dense region covering more than  <dig> mb and encodes mhc class i and ii molecules in addition to numerous other immune related molecules. the classical mhc region is located on chromosome  <dig>  while duplicated regions are found on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  resulting from two whole-genome duplications  <cit> . the primary form of the mhc class i molecule consists of an alpha chain, stabilized by a β2-microglobulin  molecule.

mhc class i molecules are at present divided into two main categories; classical mhc class i  and nonclassical mhc class i  where the latter category contains a multitude of molecules with various ligand binding abilities. mhc class ia molecules are extremely polymorphic and expressed in most cells where they present self and nonself peptides primarily to cd8+ t-cells. in humans the mhc class ia molecules are encoded by the hla-a, hla-b and hla-c loci. the mhc class ib molecules are less polymorphic and have a more restricted tissue distribution. the mhc class ib family include the peptide binders like hla-e, hla-f, hla-g. additionally lipid binders like cd <dig>  non-ligand binders like mic-a/b and hfe, and other molecules like mr <dig>  zag, fcrn and ulbp have features of mhc class ib character. an emerging view on the mhc class ib molecules are their prominent role bridging the innate and acquired immunity  <cit> .

teleost fishes also display a wide variety of mhc class i molecules, and earlier reports classify these genes into the u-, z- and l-lineage based on evolutionary relationship  <cit> . however information regarding polymorphic content, expression patterns and ligand binding are mostly lacking for these mhc class i genes. the broad u-lineage is present in most teleosts, covering both mhc class ia and ib sequences. z-lineage molecules have now been identified in a multitude of teleosts  <cit> . l-lineage molecules are so far only found in salmonids and cyprinids, and represent highly divergent class ib genes  <cit> .

all teleost fishes have their mhc class i and ii regions located on different linkage groups  <cit> , an event thought to have emerged by a genome duplication event early in the teleost evolution  <cit> . a unique salmonid specific genome duplication event occurring  <dig> mya  <cit>  resulted in a duplicated mhc class i region residing on different chromosomes in salmonids  <cit>  and the two regions are denoted class ia and class ib  <cit> . the classical uba locus in addition to a ula locus lacking a transmembrane region reside in the ia region, while a class ib pseudolocus uca was found in the atlantic salmon ib region  <cit> . this is in contrast to what was found in rainbow trout, where the ia region only contained a uba locus and the ib region contained three expressed nonclassical genes  in addition to one ufa pseudolocus  <cit> . studies by kiryu et al and miller et al  <cit>  revealed the existence of additional mhc class i loci in salmonids , although the genomic location of these loci remained unclear. additionally, a class i molecule first reported by shum et al.  <cit> , was defined as if belonging to the u-lineage , despite its phylogenetic divergence from traditionally u-lineage molecules. an equally divergent class i molecule defined as the l-lineage was reported by dijkstra et al  <cit>  in rainbow trout, atlantic salmon, zebrafish and fathead minnow.

here we describe the genomic organization of u-, z-, and s-lineage mhc class i genes in atlantic salmon, where saa  replaces the uaa nomenclature because of its distant phylogenetic relationship to any other class i molecules. additionally expression profiling, polymorphism, peptide binding properties and phylogenetic relationship were studied to further characterize the mhc class i molecules.

RESULTS
characterization and sequencing of bac clones
an atlantic salmon bac library was screened with probes for uha, uaa and ze, and positive bacs were ordered into contigs using restriction fragment analysis together with grasp hindiii fingerprint information. after pcr verification that the bacs contained sequence of interest, 184h <dig> and 114l <dig> were chosen as sequencing candidates for uha and uaa respectively. we rename uaa to saa  and will use this definition throughout the paper.

the ze positive bacs clustered into two contigs and were shown to represent extensions of sequenced bacs in the duplicated mhc class i regions based on fingerprint data  <cit> . 129p <dig> was chosen from the ia region, while 68o <dig> for the ib region. 439h <dig> was later chosen and sequenced to obtain a continuous sequence of the ib region and the overlapping sequence of 439h <dig> and 68o <dig> showed 100% sequence identity over  <dig> bp. an overview of the genomic position of all sequenced bacs covering the ia and ib regions is shown in figure  <dig> 

in our previous study we identified two bacs  positive for an allelic version of the ib region since pcr analysis revealed that these two bac clones possessed different uca-like sequences  <cit> . thus they were chosen as sequencing candidates. additionally we chose to sequence a bac that was pcr positive for uga .

the bacs 439j <dig>  222f <dig>  184h <dig>  114l <dig> and 357c <dig> were initially sequenced using  <dig> technologies. later sanger shotgun libraries were made and sequenced to close gaps for 439j <dig>  114l <dig> and 184h <dig>  the remaining bac clones 129p <dig>  439h <dig> and 68o <dig> were subjected to sanger sequencing only.

our additional sequence data i.e. 129p <dig> extends the atlantic salmon ia region to cover  <dig> kb, while the ib region being extended with 222f <dig>  439h <dig> and 68o <dig> now covers  <dig> kb. 439j <dig> was indeed an allelic variant of the previously ib representative 8i <dig>  with an insertion of  <dig> kb that increased the total described ib region to  <dig> kb.

to identify the genomic location of the saa and uha positive bacs they were mapped in a mapping reference panel to linkage groups  <dig> and linkage group  <dig> respectively  <cit>  . the ia region containing the classical locus uba resides on linkage group  <dig> while the nonclassical ib region is located on linkage group  <dig>  <cit> . an association between linkage groups and chromosomes can be found in phillips et al  <cit> .

the bac clones were submitted to genbank and have the following accession numbers 114l <dig> , 184h <dig> , 439j <dig> , 68o <dig> , 439h <dig>  and 129p <dig> . 222f <dig> and 357c <dig> are only partially sequenced using  <dig> and thus not sent to genbank.

genomic surroundings of atlantic salmon u-, s-, and z- lineage genes
we have used nomenclature with ia covering the uba locus region and ib for the duplicated uca/uda region. new genes identified here will be named accordingly; the ia genes are given an extension of a  and the ib genes have an extension of b . previously identified mhc class i molecules from the z-lineage have been termed ze with allelic extensions. we here propose that the four z-lineage loci should be named with three letters as used for other mhc class i genes i.e zaa; first letter - describing lineage, second letter - increasing letters a, b, c and d to reflect locus and the last letter - a for alpha chain.

a mhc class i gene residing in 114l <dig> was originally defined as uaa in rainbow trout by shum  <cit> . here we rename this gene to saa to visualize the fact that this molecule shows very low identity to other u-lineage molecules . we propose that the lineage should be designated as s as this class i lineage was first described in salmonids. the gene organization of u-, s- and z-lineage containing regions are shown in figure  <dig>  439j <dig> represents an allelic version of the ib region residing on lg <dig> thus denoted lg3- <dig> 

genes for zaa, atf6a and tnxba were found in the extended ia region. the ib region was extended with genes for uga, ring1b, rps18b, vps52b, vhsvb, atf6b, tnxbb, psmb <dig>  cenpa, zba, zca, zda, atad <dig>  zhx <dig>  zhx <dig>  we also found four almost identical genes in the extended ib region which had several est matches  and we define them as hypothetical  as their functions are currently unknown. the three first genes were 100% identical on a protein level, while the last gene contained one amino acid substitution. genes identified in 114l <dig> on lg <dig> were saa, vwa5a, vwa5a-homolog, akt <dig>  and in 184h <dig> two uha genes  were identified in addition to ahr <dig>  ahr <dig>  agpat <dig> and pdxk.

the gene tnxb was found in both the ia and ib regions, being an atlantic salmon ortholog of a gene residing in the extended human mhc class iii region. tnxb is a member of the tenascin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, which has anti-adhesive effects and functions in matrix maturation during wound healing  <cit> . atf <dig> was also identified in both regions. the human atf6-beta  is located close to tnxb on chromosome  <dig>  while atf6-alpha is located on chromosome  <dig>  atf6-beta functions as a transcription factor in the unfolded protein response pathway during endoplasmatic reticulum stress  <cit> .

we also found genes in the ib region that we have previously found in the ia region; ring <dig>  rps <dig>  vps <dig> and vhsv. some of these genes were quite divergent from their ia counterparts with 91%, 100%, 75% and 70% amino acid identity respectively. vps <dig> in the ib region is probably a pseudogene, since the gene only consisted of  <dig> amino acids  compared to  <dig> aa in ia. however, vps <dig> showed 100% identity toward a predicted cds in genbank , thus indicating that this ib genes is still expressed. vps <dig> in humans is located on chromosome  <dig> in a head-to-head orientation with the gene encoding ribosomal protein s <dig> 

the atad <dig>  zhx <dig> and zhx <dig> genes identified in the extended ib region have an identical gene orientation as that found on human chromosome  <dig>  atad <dig> belongs to a large family of atpases and these proteins often perform chaperone-like functions that assist in the assembly, operation and disassembly of protein complexes  <cit> . members of the zinc fingers and homeoboxes gene family  are nuclear homodimeric transcriptional repressors that interact with the a subunit of nuclear factor-y  and contain two c2h2-type zinc fingers and five homeobox dna-binding domains  <cit> .

we found a cdna match for psmb <dig>  which is a subunit of the 20s proteasome subunit complex in the ib region. perhaps a duplicated psmb <dig> gene exists in atlantic salmon as another sequence  showed 68% identity on the protein level. psmb <dig> is located on chromosome  <dig> in humans and on chromosome  <dig> in zebrafish  as the human and zebrafish mhc region resides on chr. <dig> and chr. <dig> respectively.

genes identified in the uha and saa positive bacs were two ahr genes, agpat <dig> and pdxk in 184h <dig> and vwa5a and akt <dig> in 114l <dig>  the ahr <dig> gene shows high similarity towards a genbank mrna sequence , but lacks exon <dig> and  <dig>  hansson et al described three atlantic salmon ahr <dig> genes  and two ahr <dig> genes , all containing a minimum of  <dig> exons  <cit> . either the two lacking ahr <dig> exons are located upstream of 184h <dig> or this gene is a pseudogene with a functional copy somewhere else. we found no matching est for the predicted ahr <dig> gene which we then define as a pseudogene.

agpat <dig> and pdxk have also been identified in zebrafish located on chromosome  <dig>  agpat <dig> shows 83% identity to one genbank est  whilst another est clone  shows 93% identity suggestive of a duplicated locus elsewhere. this gene is highly conserved with the salmon sequence displaying more than 74% identity towards orthologs in mammals such as human, horse and pig. agpat <dig> is involved in the second step in the de novo phospholipid biosynthetic pathway where agpat <dig> is an acyltransferase that converts lysophosphatidic acid into phosphatidic acid  <cit> . pdxk phosphorylates vitamin b <dig>  a step required for the conversion of vitamin b <dig> to pyridoxal-5-phosphate, an important cofactor in intermediary metabolism  <cit> . we found two copies of vwa5a, which martin et al show might function as a candidate tumor supressor gene in man and the gene is located on human chromosome 11q23-q <dig>  <cit> .

atlantic salmon mhc class i genes
in the ia region only one new mhc class i locus was identified . in the ib region, a functional uda locus was identified  <dig> kb upstream of the uca pseudo locus in addition to the uga locus and three z-lineage loci . figure  <dig> shows exon and intron boundaries for the described atlantic salmon mhc class i genes from the u-, z- and s-lineages.

u-lineage
sasa-uda and sasa-ucaψ
the 439j <dig> bac is an allelic version of the ib region previously sequenced and represented by the bac 8i <dig>  <cit> . previously we identified only one mhc class i gene, the uca pseudo locus in the ib region. a similar pseudo locus was also identified in the allelic 439j <dig> bac showing 93% sequence identity towards the ucaψ in 8i <dig>  we thus named the previously reported uca allele ucaψ * <dig>  whilst the allele in 439j <dig> is named ucaψ * <dig>  the ucaψ * <dig> allele contains an identical internal stop codon as in ucaψ * <dig> allele making this a pseudogene as well. the ucaψ * <dig> allele in 439j <dig> shows 93% sequence identity towards the ucaψ * <dig> allele in 8i <dig> 

439j <dig> contains a duplicated mhc class i locus residing approximately  <dig> kb upstream of ucaψ * <dig>  which we named sasa-uda. dijkstra et al.  <cit>  found a similar haplotype variation in rainbow trout. we found an est match for this uda locus , which is fully intact and expressed. the 439j <dig> uda allele shows 95% sequence identity towards the ucaψ * <dig> allele in 8i <dig>  sasa-uda showed 90% identity towards rainbow trout uda* <dig>  and 89% identity to onmy-uca* <dig> . only a limited polymorphism was observed in the few est or full-length cdnas available for uca and uda sequences. further studies are needed to assess the polymorphic content for atlantic salmon uca and uda loci in comparison to what dijkstra et al. described in rainbow trout  <cit> .

comparing the region between ucaψ and colla <dig>  there is approx 98% identity between the 8i <dig>  and 439j <dig>  sequences, while the 439j <dig> sequence upstream of the uca locus has no identity to 8i <dig> apart from the uda locus. sequence comparison shows that there is 100% identity for the other encoded proteins in 439j <dig> and 8i <dig>  the partial sequence of 357c <dig>  being an extended version of 439j <dig>  did contain genes for tapbp, daxx, zbtb <dig>  kifc <dig>  flot <dig> and tubb upstream of the uda locus similar to what is found in the ia region. as the 357c <dig> sequence consists of  <dig> unlinked contigs the exact organization of these genes in the ib region remains unknown.

sasa-uga
the sasa-uga locus is inserted in the ib region between the genes for slc39a and ring <dig>  multiple salmon ests matched this locus  and assembled together  they provide a full-length sasa-uga cdna sequence with 81% sequence identity towards rainbow trout uga .

sasa-uha
the two sasa uha genes identified in 184h <dig> were named uha <dig> and uha <dig> and both loci have matching ests. the duplicated uha <dig> and uha <dig> loci both showed more than 93% identity towards ests previously named uha and uhb by miller et al  <cit> . a distinct difference between uha <dig> and uha <dig> is a three nucleotide insertion  in the α2-domain in uha <dig>  uha <dig> and uha <dig> are oriented in the same direction and show high similarity towards each other, but approximately 40-50% identity towards other u-linage molecules. two different ests matching the uha <dig> locus were identified, and they are most likely splice variants. uha1* <dig>  contains  <dig> exons, while uha1* <dig>  contains  <dig> exons, with the last exon containing only a stop-codon. uha1* <dig> contains an inserted exon consisting of  <dig> bp after the α <dig> domain , which contributes to an earlier stop in the cds compared to . the nomenclature used for these splice variants is only temporary, awaiting a nomenclature debate.

s-lineage
the saa locus identified in 114l <dig> showed 96% aa identity to onmy-saa* <dig> , and we found a matching atlantic salmon est . as mentioned above, the salmonid saa sequence shows very little similarity towards other u-lineage genes, with for instance approx 30% identity to sasa-uba alleles. sasa-saa* <dig> is a compact class i gene with small intron sizes compared to the other mhc class i genes. sasa-saa* <dig> contains the same characteristics as onmy-saa* <dig>  <cit>  with six exons and five introns, and an incapacitated transposable element in intron  <dig> 

z-lineage
we found  <dig> z-lineage genes, one in the extended ia region and three in the extended ib region and this is in accordance with miller et al  <cit>  who identified four different ze exon  <dig> sequences. the previously reported atlantic salmon sasa-ze* <dig> sequence  shows 91% sequence identity towards the ia linked zaa locus, and most likely emerged from this locus. the zaa sequence in the 129p <dig> bac is named sasa-zaa* <dig>  while the previously reported sequence sasa-ze* <dig> should be renamed sasa-zaa* <dig> 

we have also identified matching est clones for zba  and zca  making these bona-fide genes, while zda lacks the leader peptide suggestive of a pseudogene. zba* <dig> and zca* <dig> show 96% sequence identity over  <dig> bp, while the remaining 3' sequence shows little sequence identity.

comparing the separate exons of all the z-lineage genes , the highest sequence identity overall was found in exon <dig> and exon <dig>  ranging from 89-96% identity for exon <dig>  84-92% identity for exon <dig>  while exon <dig> showed 69-86% identity . comparing the different exons of zba* <dig> and zca* <dig> we found 95%, 92% and 86% identity in exon <dig>  exon <dig> and exon <dig> respectively. they are all orientated in a head to tail fashion.

the exon-intron organization of the four z-lineage mhc class i genes are quite different with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> exons for zaa, zba, zca and zdaψ respectively. the connecting peptide, transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains are all encoded by exon  <dig> in zaa. in zba, this region in encoded by exons  <dig> and  <dig> where the transmembrane region has been lost. in zca, the 4th exon is larger than for any other class i gene and encodes the α <dig> domain in addition to the connecting peptide, transmembrane and cytoplasmic region. however this exon-intron organization is truly unorthodox. a sequence comparison of the zba sequence with the genomic region downstream of the zca α <dig> domain showed that a similar exon-intron organisation as in zba could be identified for zca as well. thus the ests identified for the zca gene could be splicoforms.

phylogenetic analysis of fish mhc class i molecules
the mhc class i amino acid sequences from the u-, s-, z- and l-lineages in addition to mhc class i sequences from various fishes, man and shark were used to draw a phylogenetic tree . with bootstrap values ranging from 90-100% the u, z, l and s sequences form distinct clusters. most published fish class i sequences belong to the u-lineage, while the z-lineage so far contains sequences from fewer teleost species including the pufferfish family, zebrafishes, carp and japanese flounder. l-lineage class i molecules are so far only identified in zebrafish, fathead minnow and salmonids, while class i sequences from the s-lineage are only found in catfish and salmonids.

among the atlantic salmon u-lineage class i sequences there is a close relationship between the sasa-uba and sasa-ula suggesting that ula is a recent duplication of uba. an ula homolog is so far not identified in rainbow trout. sasa-uda and sasa-uga cluster on separate nodes together with their rainbow trout homologs. overall, the u-lineage sequences from all teleosts cluster together with their taxonomic superorder families, that is; acanthopterygii, protacanthopterygii and ostariophysi. one exception is the sasa-uha <dig> and sasa-uha <dig> that branch off early on a separate node from all other u-lineage sequences, showing a more distant phylogenetic relationship. whether the uha sequences diverged this early as the phylogenetic tree indicates stands as an open debate as the uha genes are located on a separate linkage group , suggesting a separate evolutionary origin from the other u-lineage located on linkage group  <dig> and  <dig>  interestingly, the α <dig> domain  of the uha molecules shows very low amino acid conservation in comparison to other u-lineage genes. likewise, the human nonclassical gene mr <dig>  <cit> , show a similar identity in the α <dig> and α <dig> domains towards the classical counterparts  while the α <dig> domain is more divergent. the functional relevance of this lack of conservation remains unknown.

the z-lineage molecules also cluster together with their taxonomic superorder families, although including fewer sequences than the u-lineage sequences. so far the atlantic salmon is the only teleost species reported, with  <dig> different expressed z-lineage genes.

the atlantic salmon s-lineage molecule shows a close relationship to the onmy-saa molecule. based on their sequence identity, both molecules seem to have evolved very little following the divergence of these two species  <cit> .

expression of atlantic salmon mhc class i genes
one of the definitions of a mhc class ia gene is that it is expressed in most tissues. to investigate the expression patterns of atlantic salmon mhc class i molecules, blood, foregut, hindgut, head kidney, gills, spleen, liver, eye, tongue, skin, muscle, heart and brain samples were taken from three atlantic salmon individuals and analyzed for gene expression by quantitative real-time pcr . to evaluate the expression patterns from the heart, blood was included as sample to differentiate between the expression patterns in heart structural tissue.

highest expression for uba was observed in foregut, hindgut, spleen and gills, while moderate expression was observed in blood and heart. lowest expression was observed in tongue, liver and brain. without using an absolute quantification method i.e. including a standard curve, it is not possible to compare different genes for same tissues, however the transcriptional level of other mhc class i genes were low in comparison to uba with the exception of uga in blood. in general, the high expression of uba in comparison to the other mhc class i genes, is also supported by hits found in databases. various blastn, blastx, and tblastn searches in genbank  <cit>  and cgrasp  <cit>  using uba sequences hit numerous sequences, while blasting with other u-, s-, or z-lineage sequences results in generally few hits.

we found that ula had highest expression in tongue, and lower in skin and heart. in contrast to our results, miller et al  <cit>  found that ula was only weakly expressed in posterior kidney in un-infected fish, while expression was up-regulated in ihnv-infected liver, brain and eye tissues. they did not detect expression in the heart of un-infected nor infected tissues. uda showed little variation in expression patterns between the different tissues tested. the remaining nonclassical u-lineage class i genes, uha <dig>  uha <dig> and uga all showed the highest expression in blood.

expression analysis of the z-lineage genes showed that zaa had highest expression in blood, while lower expression in the heart, spleen, gills and hindgut. zba was 2-fold more expressed in the heart than in the spleen, but lower in the other tissues. the z-lineage genes seem ubiquitously expressed in most tissues tested similar to that observed by miller et al  <cit> . little difference in expression patterns for the various tissues was observed for the saa gene.

both ula and zba lack transmembrane, connecting peptide and cytoplasmic domains and probably are secreted mhc class i molecules. based on their expression patterns they could have specific functions in the heart. the z-lineage expression such as zaa in blood and heart, and zba in the heart, suggest interesting functions to be unravelled.

during the initial studies we checked the pcr products amplified during realtime pcr on agarose gels, and observed that products for uha <dig> contained two bands that were equally expressed, with exception in muscle where the smallest band was missing. sequencing of these pcr products showed that the largest fragment represented the uha1* <dig> allele with the additional exon, while the smallest pcr product represented the uha1* <dig> allele.

we have only investigated un-stimulated tissues, and it is most likely that the expression patterns would be different in stimulated tissues. based on expression patterns and polymorphic content only uba can be classified as a true classical mhc class i gene, while the others should be classified as nonclassical mhc molecules.

structure and function of atlantic salmon mhc class i molecules
structure and composition of mhc class i genes are quite variable both within and between vertebrate groups, with the α1α <dig> domains containing most of the polymorphism. in mammals, the presence of nine evolutionary conserved sites within the α1α <dig> domains have been defined as residues that anchor the peptide  <cit> . these residues are highly conserved in classical as well as in most nonclassical molecules like hla-e, hla-f and hla-g. the set of residues in mammals are yyyyyytkw, while in non-mammalian vertebrates it has changed slightly to yyyyrftkw  <cit> . deduced atlantic salmon mhc class i amino acid sequences identified in our bacs in addition to a sequence belonging to the l-lineage   were aligned with human mhc class i sequences . presence of conserved peptide anchoring sites for all atlantic salmon class i sequences including human, chicken and shark are summarized in table  <dig> 

comparison of atlantic salmon uba* <dig> , uba* <dig> , ula , uga, uda, uha <dig>  uha <dig>  zaa, zba, zca, saa , lba , b-f <dig>  , trsc-uaa* <dig>   and hla-a <dig> .

for the mhc class i uba locus we included two highly divergent alleles, where uba* <dig> contains the non-mammalian motif while uba* <dig> differ in one residue, a <dig>  one or rarely two substitutions of these conserved residues have also been observed in both human and mouse mhc class ia sequences  <cit> . the ula locus described as a secretory class i molecule due to a missing transmembrane domain  <cit> , does display the conserved motif for non mammalian vertebrates, and may thus still bind peptides. the two uha loci have one residue different from the classical uba locus at f <dig>  a tyrosine/phenylalanine substitution is common amongst non mammalian vertebrates, and may not interfere with binding capacity. the uda and uga have two and three residues different from uba. these are not conservative substitutions , and most likely influence peptide-binding. overall it seems like all the u-lineage sequences in atlantic salmon are able to present peptides based on these nine anchor residues.

both saa and lba sequences have quite different residues in some or all of these positions when compared against the uba classical class i sequences. seven of the nine residues are found to differ from the nonmammalian motif in saa sequences, while all of the nine residues are found to differ in lba sequences. in mammals, the class ib molecule cd <dig>  known to bind lipid and glycolipid ligands do not contain this peptide binding motif  <cit> . thus it is likely that saa and lba binds non-peptide ligands or none at all as the mammalian class ib molecules mic-a/b and hfe. in rainbow trout, shum et al concluded that onmy-saa  has properties indicative of a particularly divergent class ib gene  <cit> .

the z-lineage sequences also follow the non mammalian motif with the exception of one common different residue, f <dig>  three amino acids downstream of f <dig>  all z-lineage sequences have a tyrosine  residue which might function as the conserved peptide anchoring residue. this has also been observed in cyprinid class i ze sequences which suggests that use of the tyrosine y <dig> might affect and extend the peptide binding groove, leading to binding of somewhat larger peptides  <cit> . another possibility is that a substitution of a tyrosine  residue by a phenylalanine  in position y <dig> may not have major implications for the ability to bind peptide termini since most non mammalian mhc class ia sequences have a similar substitution of a tyrosine residue by a phenylalanine residue at position y <dig> 

in humans there is a stretch from aa 231- <dig> in the class i α <dig> domain known to interact with β <dig> m  <cit> . in this region, the uha and all z-, s- and l-lineage sequences have a specific motif, p <dig>  y <dig> and r <dig>  which may influence the association with β <dig> m. atlantic salmon express up to twelve different β <dig> m molecules , which group into two lineages, ba <dig>  and ba <dig>  which may stabilize different mhc class i sequences; one lineage may bind to uha, z-, s- and l -lineage molecules and the other β <dig> m lineage may bind and stabilize the remaining u-lineage molecules that also show a conservation in this region. in humans, there are also at least four class ib molecules that do not bind β <dig> m   <cit> . future studies are needed to clarify β <dig> m binding of salmonid mhc class i molecules.

other features that are shared between the atlantic salmon class i molecules and nearly all mhc class ia and ib molecules of other vertebrates, include  <dig> conserved cysteine residues located in the α2α <dig> domains forming disulfide bonds within theses domains and the highly conserved fyp motif at positions 208- <dig> aa in the α <dig> domain  <cit> . most class i sequences contain an n-linked glycosylation site near the end of the α <dig> domain. the amino acid residues which correspond to the cd <dig> binding site of the hla-a locus are at positions 223- <dig> in the atlantic salmon sequences. both classical and some nonclassical mammalian mhc class i molecules have a well conserved negatively charged cd <dig> binding site in the α <dig> domain . here the atlantic salmon classical uba molecules have an acidic stretch consisting of  <dig> negatively charged aa , also found in the ula, uga and uda molecules. the uha <dig> and uha <dig> molecules consist of  <dig> and  <dig> negatively charged aa respectively. the saa molecule has  <dig>  while the z molecules has from  <dig> to  <dig> negatively charged aa in the this region. both cd8α and cd8β chains have been described in the atlantic salmon  <cit> . the cd <dig> molecule can be expressed both in a homodimeric and heterodimeric form, where the latter is most expressed in mammals, preferably in circulating lymphocytes. the lower acidic content in this region for the uha, saa and z molecules may influence the lymphocyte interactions in contrast to the higher acidic content for uba, ula, uga and uda molecules.

having classified the atlantic salmon class i molecules into functional categories based on traditional criterions, the functional properties of these molecules still remain unclear. sasa-ula and sasa-zba exists in a soluble form, while the sasa-uha <dig> locus expresses both membrane bound and a soluble variant as a result of alternative splicing, leading to loss of the tm/cyt domain by a frame shift. in humans, both mhc class ia and ib molecules are also known to exist in soluble forms. the classical hla-a, -b and -c loci express soluble variants that play a role in cell death of activated t cells  <cit> . another example is the human non-classical hla-g molecules that exist in several different isoforms both membrane bound and secreted forms where the soluble variant is caused by alternative splicing where the tm/cyt domains are deleted  <cit> . the soluble hla-g is found expressed specifically in placental tissue and is secreted during pregnancy  <cit>  and also thought to be involved in inducing apoptosis in activated maternal cd8+ t cells  <cit> . the functional relevance of soluble class i molecules remain to be established in fish.

CONCLUSIONS
here we describe the genomic organization of u-, z-, and s-lineage mhc class i molecules in atlantic salmon. nine of the described class i genes are located in the extension of the duplicated ia and ib regions, while three class i genes are found on two separate linkage groups. the gene organization of the two regions indicates that the ib region is evolving at a different pace than the ia region. the ib region contains  <dig> chitin synthase genes not present in the ia region. four gene duplications are seen for both a hypothetical protein as well as for the z-lineage genes, a phenomenon not found in the ia region. there is also haplotypic uca/uda variation while the uea and ufa genes residing in the rainbow trout ib region have been lost since oncorhynchus and salmo split, which probably was around 15- <dig> mya. the functional consequence of this evolution remains to be established. expression profiling, polymorphic content, peptide binding properties and phylogenetic relationship show that atlantic salmon has only one expressed mhc class ia gene , in addition to a multitude of nonclassical loci from the u-, s and z-lineages. further studies are needed to verify the functional properties of the mhc class ib molecules in teleost.
