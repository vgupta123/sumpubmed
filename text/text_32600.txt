BACKGROUND
the discovery of new snps and the continuous declining cost of genotyping the bovine genome are making it possible to investigate genome-wide linkage disequilibrium  in detail. linkage disequilibrium refers to a non-random association in the occurrence of alleles at two loci, which results in a higher frequency of certain haplotypes at the loci than expected by chance.

the knowledge of the extent and the pattern of ld throughout the bovine genome plays an important role in gene mapping and genome-wide association studies and is a fundamental tool for: exploring the degree of diversity among breeds of cattle, inferring the distribution of crossing-over, and identifying regions of genome that have been subject to selective sweep. a high resolution ld map can also provide beneficial information for designing snp panels for genome-wide selection.

the two most commonly used measures of ld for bi-allelic markers are r <dig> and |d'|. the range of both measures is between  <dig> and  <dig>  |d'| <  <dig> indicates that historical recombination has occurred between the loci and |d'| =  <dig> indicates absence of recombination between the two loci since the occurrence of one of the polymorphism. therefore |d'| is rather an indicator of missing haplotypes than a reliable measure of ld  <cit> . moreover |d'| tends to be strongly inflated in small samples and in the presence of a rare allele  <cit> . r <dig> represents the correlations between the two loci and r <dig> =  <dig> when only two haplotypes are present, which is usually a consequence of population bottlenecks or genetic drift  <cit> . r <dig> is preferred for association studies, because there is a simple inverse relationship between r <dig> and the sample size that is required to detect the association between a qtl and the snp  <cit> .

diploid cells of bos taurus contain  <dig> homologous autosomal pairs and one pair of sex chromosomes. all autosomes are acrocentric, however, both gonosomes  are submetacentric  <cit> . the x chromosome  is the second largest chromosome of the bovine karyotype  <cit>  and is composed of two distinct regions: the pseudo-autosomal region , which is homologous to the y chromosome and the x-specific region. in females, the cross-over can occur at any segment of the chr x. on the other hand, in males, the cross-over is limited only to the par region. there is also variability in recombination rates on autosomes  <cit> , which, apart from other factors, leads to considerable diversity of the ld pattern in different genomic regions. generally, ld is higher on the chr x than on the autosomes  <cit> . the y chromosome is one of the smallest chromosomes  <cit> , its y-specific part is gene poor and consists of repetitive sequences, which makes a physical mapping of this region difficult and consequently there is no y chromosome map available so far for bovine  <cit> .

previous studies on ld in dairy cattle were based on microsatellites and reported high levels of ld for long distances  <cit> . recent studies used snps for evaluating the extent of ld and revealed that strong ld extends for shorter distances than previously reported. marques et al.  <cit>  reported  moderate levels of ld  extending up to  <dig> kb, similar results were presented by mckay et al.   <cit> . in the study by khatkar et al.   <cit> , r2≥ <dig>  was observed in australian holsteins between snps less than  <dig> kb apart. sargolzaei et al. <cit>  reported useful ld  between markers with inter-marker distance ≤  <dig> kb in north american holsteins . there is variation in the published extent of ld because the estimates of ld strongly depends on various factors such as: history and structure of the studied population , sample size, marker type , density and distribution of markers, type of method used for haplotype reconstruction, strictness of snp filtering , use of maternal haplotypes only or both maternal and paternal haplotypes. the objective of this study was to investigate the extent and the pattern of ld on the autosomes and on the chromosome x of north american holsteins.

RESULTS
out of  <dig>  snps used in this study,  <dig>  snps were spread out across the  <dig> bovine autosomes  and  <dig> snps were located on chr x. the approximate boundary between the x-specific and par regions was located at  <dig>  mb, which is in agreement with sandor et al.  <cit> . the x-specific and the par regions harboured  <dig> and  <dig> snps, respectively. the distribution of snp minor allele frequencies  of these snps was nearly uniform on both autosomes and chr x . the average maf of all snps before editing was  <dig>  and after the  <dig>  snps with maf <  <dig>  were removed the averaged maf increased to  <dig> . the average maf was slightly higher than the average maf of snps reported for the snps on the illumina bovinesnp50k beadchip for holstein by the bovine hapmap consortium   <cit>  and by matukumalli et al.   <cit> . the snps were almost uniformly distributed across the autosomes with an average inter-marker distance of  <dig> kb . on the other hand, snps were not evenly spaced on chr x . there were certain regions of chr x where adjacent snps were separated by more than  <dig> mb . the average distance between the adjacent snps on chr x was  <dig> kb.

analysis of decay of linkage disequilibrium
in order to examine the decay of ld with physical distance, snp pairs on the autosomes were sorted into bins based on their inter-marker distance and average values of r <dig> and |d'| were calculated for each bin . moderate levels of r <dig>  were observed at distances shorter than  <dig> kb. when moving from  <dig> to  <dig> kb, average r <dig> declined from  <dig>  to  <dig> . high variability of r <dig> was observed in bins with a marker distance <  <dig> mb. markers with r2≥ <dig>  were on average spaced by  <dig> kb. but not all markers with the  <dig> kb inter-marker distance had r2≥ <dig> . in the  <dig> to  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb bins, only  <dig> and 23% of markers had r <dig> ≥ <dig> , respectively. figure  <dig> shows a scatter plot of |d'| values against distance. in contrast to decay of r <dig>  where ld values clearly declined with distance, the changes of |d'| followed a much less steeper declining pattern. average |d'| of markers 40- <dig> kb apart was  <dig>  and 19% of snp pairs with  <dig> - <dig> mb inter-marker distance had |d'| >  <dig>  . |d'| =  <dig> was observed at distances exceeding  <dig> mb.

on chr x, ld was calculated separately for snps located on the x-specific and the par regions of chr x . higher levels of ld were found on the x-specific region of chr x than on autosomes. very low levels of ld, even at very short distances , were reported on the par region. this was expected because in males, the cross-over is limited to the par region and consequently the rate of recombination was higher in this segment. on the other hand, the x-specific region is recombined only in gametes produced by females and consequently only two thirds of the x chromosomes recombine in each generation  <cit> . overall, ld on chr x was greater compared to ld on autosomes. it can be explained by not only a lower recombination rate but also by a lower mutation rate and a faster genetic drift due to a smaller effective population size  <cit> .

linkage disequilibrium of intragenic  and intergenic pairs of snp was investigated. kim et al.  <cit>  reported a higher ld and a higher variation in intragenic regions than in intergenic regions. in this study, there were no differences in the extent of ld and the decline of ld with the distance between intragenic and intergenic regions .

when the decay of r <dig> with a distance was plotted separately for each chromosome, several snp pairs on bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta  <dig> showed higher r <dig> than expected . this was a possible indication of misplaced snps on those chromosomes. in order to identify those likely misplaced snps, a simple algorithm based on investigation of the decay of ld with distance was developed. the distance between each of the  <dig>  snps and a snp with which it had the largest r <dig> was recorded. if this distance was larger than  <dig> mb, the particular snp was flagged as a possibly misplaced snp and it was further investigated. this algorithm detected  <dig> misplaced snps. the majority of the misplaced snps were on bta  <dig> , bta  <dig> , bta  <dig>  and chr x . the correct location of these snps was approximated by assuming that the snp was located between two markers with the highest pairwise r <dig> with the snp. additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig> shows the decay of ld with a distance of using their original location and the corrected position of the misplaced snps. the smoother pattern of the declining trend of r <dig> with a distance in plots where the position of the snp was corrected suggests that our simplified approximation of the snp location has a reasonable accuracy. also the pattern of the decay of ld on bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta  <dig> acquired the expected shape after the position of misplaced snps was corrected . our simple algorithm identified  <dig> % of snps as misplaced. it is very likely that there could be other snp with incorrect location, especially on bta  <dig> and chr x, where the pattern of ld was slightly erratic in certain regions even after the corrections. this is because the algorithm was not able to identify snps that were misplaced by only a few mb, due to the high heterogeneity of ld at short distances.

paternal versus maternal haplotypes
using only maternally inherited haplotypes is a common practice in studies investigating ld with the sample population consisting of large sire half-sib families. the reasoning is that pedigree structure leads to overrepresentation of the paternal haplotypes in the sample, because sires have multiple progeny in the data set, which inflates frequencies of certain haplotypes and consequently leads to overestimation of ld. in order to test this hypothesis and to quantify the size of the bias of ld, |d'| and r <dig> were calculated using maternal, paternal and both haplotypes. first of all, differences in haplotype frequencies between maternal and paternal haplotypes were tested by a χ <dig> test. the frequencies of maternal haplotypes were assumed to be the true expected values and they were contrasted to the frequencies of paternal haplotypes. using the χ <dig> test, 82% of snp pairs were identified to have significantly different  haplotype frequency in maternal than in paternal haplotype. this could be due to the previously mentioned pedigree structure of our sample or it could be a result of different selection pressure in the sire of sires pathway compared to the dam of sires pathway.

non-syntenic linkage disequilibrium
linkage disequilibrium was calculated for all possible combination of pairs of snps located on different chromosomes. none of the non-syntenic snp pairs had r <dig> >  <dig> , which could have occured due to selection or if one of the snps was located on a wrong chromosome.  <dig> , <dig> non-syntenic snp pairs had |d'|≥ <dig>  but because 94% of these snps had maf <  <dig> , it suggests that low maf largely affected the estimates of |d'|. low maf increases chances of a missing haplotype and if at least one haplotype is missing |d'| =  <dig>  on the other hand, snps with rare alleles did not have inflated values of r <dig>  this is consistent with previous studies  <cit> 

effect of sample size and maf on distribution of r <dig> and |d'|
as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the sample size did not have a large effect on r <dig> values, however, an upward bias was observed in |d'|. this bias increased as the size of the subsample decreased and as the distance between snps increased. with the  <dig> sample size, |d'| was higher by 7% in the  <dig> - <dig> mb distance than with the full data set. samples with more than  <dig> bulls had a minimal bias of |d'|. estimates of r <dig> were not influenced by the sample size when at least  <dig> animals were used for the calculation. samples with only  <dig> animals resulted in an overestimation of r <dig>  these results indicate that a sample size of at least  <dig> and  <dig> animals is necessary for an accurate estimation of |d'| and r <dig>  respectively. this is in agreement with khatkar et al.  <cit>  who suggested a minimal sample size of  <dig> and  <dig> for estimation of |d'| and r <dig>  respectively.

patterns of linkage disequilibrium
non-monotonic erratic trend of average r <dig> was observed in each of the studied  <dig> chromosomes using the sliding window approach . the erratically high r <dig> in some sliding windows of autosomes were not caused by a low number of snps per window or due to high number of snps in the window with maf <  <dig>  probably created by a variation in recombination rates within chromosomes. on the other hand, there were several windows on chr x that did not even have the required  <dig> pairs of snps.

chromosomes contain local hot spots and cold spots that undergo quite different rates of meiotic recombination and these spikes in r <dig> could indicate cold spots. bovine autosomes are acrocentric and both x and y chromosomes are subemetacentric  <cit> . centromeres are special structures of eukaryotic chromosomes that hold sister chromatids together and ensure proper chromosome segregation during cell division. centromere suppresses meiotic recombination within itself and also in the proximal chromosomal region. on the other hand, regions next to the telomeres  increase recombination rates  <cit> . values of r <dig> were not noticeably higher at the very beginning or end of any autosomes compared to the middle of the chromosome, as was expected since centromeres are located in bos taurus on telomeres. therefore this finding suggests that the effect of the centromere and telomeres on recombination rate cancelled one another out. chr x has centromere in the middle of the chromosome but because there were not enough informative windows in this region, it was not possible to investigate the effect of centromers on the extent of ld of this chromosome. the telomeric parts of the chromosome did not have a noticeable higher r <dig> than the rest of the chromosome.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that |d'| is strongly inflated in small sample sizes and is strongly dependent on the allele frequency. compared to |d'|, r <dig> is a more robust measure of ld because it is less sensitive to allele frequency and a small sample size. because of the widespread use of a few elite sires in dairy cattle, paternally inherited haplotypes are recommended to be discarded, because if they are included in the analyses it could lead to overestimation of the extent of ld. high degree of heterogeneity of ld was observed on both autosomes and chr x. higher levels of ld were found on the x-specific region than on the autosomes, the x-specific region also had much higher levels of ld than the par region. no differences in the extent of ld and the decline of ld with distance were found between intragenic and intergenic regions. a simple algorithm based on syntenic ld was developed to identify misplaced snps and to approximate their physical locations. in total,  <dig> inconsistencies in physical map of snps  were identified but it is very likely that the number of inconsistencies is higher. because of the high heterogeneity of ld at short distances, our algorithm was able to detect only snps that were misplaced by several mb. however, this algorithm can be a useful part in fine mapping, imputation of unknown genotypes, identification of haplotype blocks and selection signatures where correct physical location of snps is required. in all these studies, mistakes in the order or position of snps can lead to biased results.
