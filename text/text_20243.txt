BACKGROUND
the impact of natural and sexual selection on genetic diversity has been intensively studied in both natural and captive-bred populations  <cit> , but the majority of our current knowledge in this area is derived from species with conventional sex roles, with choosy females and competitive males  <cit> . sex-role reversed species, in which females compete for mating opportunities and males are choosy  <cit> , offer exceptional opportunities to investigate central tenets of sexual selection theory and the importance of sexual selection in the maintenance of genetic diversity.

the hypervariable major histocompatibility complex  has proven to be a powerful model in which to investigate the importance of natural and sexual selection in shaping genetic diversity  <cit> . the mhc is an essential part of the vertebrate adaptive immune system, and includes a suite of more than  <dig> genes involved in the destruction of infected cells and the antibody response  <cit> . there are two major antigen-presenting groups of mhc molecules, class i and class ii genes, which differ in their function, structure and pattern of expression  <cit> . the peptide binding region  of mhc loci encodes a groove that permits the binding of specific antigens, and this region typically exhibits the highest sequence polymorphism within the gene  <cit> .

the investigation of mhc genes in a diversity of vertebrates indicates that these loci are more diverse than any other gene family  <cit> . natural selection on mhc is thought to be driven primarily by pathogens, leading to balancing selection that acts on the pbr of mhc genes  <cit> . balancing selection operates through either negative frequency-dependent selection, in which the relative fitness of individual alleles is influenced by their frequency , or via heterozygote advantage. the advantage of mhc heterozygosity lies in the potential increase of the number of different parasite-derived antigens that can be detected by a mhc-heterozygous individual's immune system  <cit> . mhc diversity can be further enhanced by selection on linked genes, due to genetic hitchhiking  <cit> . in addition to the importance of mhc genes as an integral part of the adaptive immune system, mhc-mediated odor cues have been shown to be important in mate choice, kin recognition and inbreeding avoidance  <cit> . disassortative mating is widely believed to promote mhc diversity and to increase the proportion of heterozygote individuals in natural populations  <cit> . sexual selection can thus directly contribute to mhc allelic diversity via disassortative mate choice  <cit> .

despite consistently high levels of variation, there are major differences in the genomic organization of mhc genes in different vertebrate groups. while these loci are physically linked in mammals, class i and ii genes are unlinked in bony fishes   <cit> . due to the lack of linkage of mhc genes in actinopterygians, stet et al.  <cit>  have suggested that major histocompatibility genes in these species are most accurately termed mh loci. the unlinked nature of mh genes may provide increased evolutionary flexibility and contribute to enhanced mh diversity in this group. mh gene diversity is highly variable in teleost fishes, and while some species have a single classical mh class ii beta-chain gene  , most species have multiple copies of this locus . this variation may be due, at least in part, to ancestral chromosome or genome duplications  <cit> .

while previous studies on teleosts have shown that both natural and sexual selection structure mh allelic diversity in species with conventional female-based mate choice  <cit> , no study to date has investigated mh variation in sex-role reversed species in which mating decisions are made by the male. males and females often differ in their ability to detect odor cues  <cit> , and sex differences in the production, processing and use of mh-mediated signals are expected to influence the relative efficiency of sexual selection in sex-role reversed and conventionally-mating species, potentially reducing the level of mh variation in species with reversed sex-roles.

the teleost family syngnathidae  is a well-suited model system to study questions concerning the relationship between sex roles and mh diversity. both conventional and sex-role reversed species exist in the family and sex-role reversal has evolved several times independently in this group  <cit> . studies of wild populations of the potbellied seahorse, hippocampus abdominalis, have found evidence of female-female competition and male mate choice, suggesting that natural populations of this species are sex-role reversed  <cit> .

here, we characterize mh-variation in wild-caught and captive-bred individuals of sex-role reversed populations of the potbellied seahorse, a species with a highly developed form of male parental care. genome sequencing and transcriptome screening confirm the existence of a single, highly variable copy of the mhiiβ locus in this species, with a pattern of variation identical to that detected in species with conventional sex roles. this pattern of genetic variation has been influenced by a combination of intralocus recombination and positive selection on sites believed to be important for peptide binding. mhiiβ is expressed in brood pouch tissues of male seahorses, suggesting that these molecules may be functionally active during male pregnancy. our results indicate that sex-role reversed taxa such as the seahorse are capable of maintaining the high mhc diversity typical of vertebrate species with conventional sex roles.

RESULTS
the seahorse, hippocampus abdominalis, has a single mhiiβ locus
full-length gdna sequencing of the seahorse mhiiβ locus from a single non-pregnant male identified  <dig> alleles, closely related to other teleost mhiiβ sequences . the structure of mhiiβ in the seahorse is similar to that in other vertebrates, with  <dig> exons separated by  <dig> introns of varying length . the total intron length of the  <dig> full-length alleles differs, resulting in full gene sequences of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively. intron length variability is concentrated in  <dig> single-bp repetitive regions  located in introns  <dig> and  <dig> .

complete mhiiβ exon  <dig> sequences were obtained for  <dig> captive-bred and  <dig> wild-caught individuals. irrespective of the primer combination used, a maximum of two alleles were found in all  <dig> individuals, indicating the existence of a single mhiiβ locus in this species. the comparison of parent-offspring mh profiles in  <dig> families of seahorses confirmed the mendelian inheritance of the seahorse mhiiβ locus . a 454-cdna-library of the potbellied seahorse yielded  <dig> mhiiβ sequences ,  <dig> from non-pregnant pouch tissue , and  <dig> from normalized reference tissues) which could be assembled into a single contig identical to the mhiiβ genomic dna sequence. cdna sequencing indicated that the mhiiβ gene of the seahorse is expressed in muscle, liver and brood pouch tissue.

sequence polymorphism in the pbr
sequencing of the highly-variable peptide binding region of the seahorse mhiiβ locus identified a total of  <dig> h. abdominalis mhii β1-domain alleles in  <dig> individuals . 86% of individuals were heterozygous for mhiiβ , while 14% were homozygous, consistent with hardy-weinberg expectations . an analysis of allelic assortment detected  <dig> allele combinations more frequently than expected by chance , but none of these values remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons . the  <dig> alleles include  <dig> polymorphic nucleotide sites and a total of  <dig> amino acid differences . each of the  <dig> alleles differs by at least one amino acid substitution . all alleles detected in wild individuals  were also detected in the captive-bred population. the nucleotide diversity π of the seahorse mhii β1-domain is  <dig> . the dataset used for subsequent analyses contains  <dig> bp of exon  <dig> , after omitting exon-spanning codons at the 5' and 3' ends of the exon .

a strong signal of positive selection
only  <dig> of the  <dig> nucleotide substitutions detected in exon  <dig> of the seahorse are synonymous, leading to a dn/ds ratio of  <dig>  . a strong signal of positive selection was detected in this region , and  <dig> of the  <dig> variable amino acid sites are inferred to be under positive selection  . a model incorporating positive selection fits the exon  <dig> dataset significantly better than a neutral model of evolution . non-peptide binding sites in exon  <dig> show considerably less non-synonymous variation than do pbs  and exhibit no evidence of positive selection .

probabilities  are derived from a z-test . peptide binding sites  refer to the human sites, identified by crystallographic analysis in brown et al.  <cit> .

detection of recombination
an allele network based on non-synonymous substitutions was reconstructed to visualize relationships among the  <dig> unique mhiiβ alleles. the network shows no clear spatial structure, consistent with the pattern expected for a single locus . the reticulative loop in the network suggests the presence of recombinant variants in the dataset, a hypothesis supported by statistical analyses , which indicate that  <dig> mhiiβ alleles are the result of intralocus recombination . a network without these recombinant alleles is qualitatively similar to the full network, but the placement of hiab-dab-e2* <dig> shifts in the pruned dataset, reflecting its high level of divergence from the central haplotypes .

discussion
the sex-role reversed potbellied seahorse, h. abdominalis, has a single mhiiβ gene, which exhibits the typical vertebrate pattern of high genetic diversity. the existence of a maximum of  <dig> mhiiβ alleles per individual and the analysis of parent-offspring genotypes in  <dig> families of seahorses supports the mendelian segregation of a single locus in this species. the high variability of the β1-domain of this gene, the region interacting with antigens, has been generated and maintained by a combination of positive selection and intralocus recombination, factors which have been shown to influence the pattern of mh variation in species with conventional sex roles  <cit> . the results of targeted gene sequencing are congruent with a transcriptome screen which indicates that a single copy of this locus is expressed in muscle, liver and brood pouch tissue of the seahorse. the expression of mhiiβ in pouch tissue of h. abdominalis males suggests that mh molecules may be immunologically active in brood-pouch tissues, and could possibly play a role in immune protection during the development of embryos in the paternal brood pouch  <cit> .

genetic diversity
previous studies of mhiiβ diversity in teleost fishes have demonstrated the exceptionally high diversity of this locus in this group . these studies have, however, focused on species with conventional sex roles, with female-based mate choice and male-male competition . as males and females often differ in their ability to detect olfactory cues  <cit> , the efficiency of odor-based mhc-mediated choice as a selective mechanism might be expected to differ between sex-role reversed and conventionally-mating species. disassortative mating is thought to act together with pathogen-mediated selection to maintain mhc diversity  <cit> , and species which lack the ability to detect and process mhc-based odor cues are thus expected to exhibit reduced levels of mhc diversity relative to species experiencing both forms of selection. contrary to this hypothesis, mhiiβ diversity in the sex-role reversed seahorse is similar to that detected in other teleosts , suggesting that sex-role reversed species are capable of maintaining the high mh diversity typical in other vertebrates. both natural and sexual selection are thought to influence mh diversity  <cit> , but the observation of high mhiiβ diversity in a sex-role reversed species suggests that natural selection may be sufficient to generate this high variability, a hypothesis which is currently being investigated using individual-based simulations . alternatively, sex-role reversed species may indeed be capable of processing mh-based olfactory cues, something which is currently under investigation in targeted mate choice experiments in the seahorse.

mhiiβ gene-copy variation is high in teleosts, and while some teleost fishes have more than  <dig> functional copies of mhiiβ, a small number of species have only a single locus. perhaps the best studied example of this are the ancestral tetraploid salmonids, who possess a single classical mhiiβ gene  <cit> . the high mhii β1-domain diversity of the potbellied seahorse is similar to that found in this group. the seahorse carries a similar number of alleles , but exhibits fewer polymorphic sites  than that found in salmonids   <cit> . h. abdominalis and salmonids show comparable nucleotide diversities in the pbr-containing β1-domain of exon  <dig> .

as interlocus gene conversion is thought to contribute to the diversity of gene families  <cit> , one might expect to see higher intralocus variability in species carrying multiple mhiiβ loci. while species carrying several functional copies of mhiiβ possess a higher total number of alleles, intralocus measures of mhiiβ pbr diversity in these species are in fact less than those observed in species with only a single locus. three-spined sticklebacks , an important model system for the study of teleost mh evolution, are thought to carry at least  <dig> copies of mhiiβ  <cit> . a recent survey of  <dig> sticklebacks from locations in europe and north america detected a total of  <dig> exon  <dig> alleles, or ≤  <dig> alleles per locus  <cit> . similarly, a survey of trinidadian guppies, poecilia reticulata, a species with at least  <dig> mhiiβ loci, recovered  <dig> exon  <dig> alleles in  <dig> individuals   <cit> . this pattern can also be observed in other species, for example in poecilia formosa  <cit>  and perca fluviatilis  <cit> , with  <dig> alleles in  <dig> individuals  and  <dig> alleles in  <dig> individuals , respectively. methodological differences in the sample sizes and spatial scales of studies of mh variation complicate comparative analyses of genetic diversity, but the fact that species carrying a single mhiiβ locus have levels of allelic variation equal or greater than those detected in species with multiple copies of these loci , suggests that intralocus allelic diversity of the mhiiβ pbr does not necessarily increase when more genes are present in a species. it is important to note, that maximal mhc diversity may also be constrained, both by interactions with the autoimmune response  <cit>  and by consistently high levels of interlocus gene conversion, which may tend to homogenize genetic variation in species carrying multiple copies of these genes  <cit> . these factors may, in part, explain the lower than expected levels of mh variation detected in such species relative to species carrying a single copy of these genes.

peptide binding sites
we detected an excess of non-synonymous substitutions relative to synonymous substitutions in the pbr-encoding β1-domain of the seahorse, a pattern consistent with that found in species with conventional female-based mate choice. due to the lack of x-ray crystallographic structure analyses of teleost mh genes, pbs in fishes are typically inferred by homology modeling to human mhc loci  <cit> . in addition, sites exhibiting a high variability and signatures of positive selection are also putative candidates for peptide binding sites  <cit> .  <dig> of the  <dig> mhii β1-domain sites of the seahorse are variable , and  <dig> of these variable sites  show evidence of positive selection.  <dig> of  <dig> sites correspond to human pbs as inferred by reche and reinherz  <cit>  . while the length of the mhii β1-domain sequenced often differs between studies, several recent studies have analysed site-specific variation in the same  <dig> amino acid fragment of mhii β <dig>  stretching from position  <dig> to  <dig> of the human alignment . a comparison among these studies indicates that the proportion of sites under positive selection in this region is similar between the sex-role reversed seahorse , and conventionally mating salmonids , poecilia spp.  and perch , illustrating the striking consistency in the pattern of mh variation among species, despite differences in their sex roles.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide the first data on the pattern of mh diversity in the seahorse , a species with an exceptionally well-developed form of paternal care and male mate choice. the sex-role reversed h. abdominalis exhibits levels of mhiiβ diversity similar to that detected in species with conventional sex roles. this species has a single functional mh class ii beta-chain gene that is expressed in the male brood pouch, suggesting that this gene may be immunologically active in these tissues. the pattern of mhiiβ genetic diversity in the seahorse has been influenced by positive selection and recombination, and intralocus genetic diversity in this species exceeds that present in species carrying multiple copies of this gene. mating experiments are currently being used to determine whether mh-odor cues are used in mate choice decisions in h. abdominalis, data which should help to shed light on the relative roles of natural and sexual selection in generating the high levels of mhiiβ diversity found in the seahorse.
