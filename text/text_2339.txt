BACKGROUND
in all fleshy fruits, fruit maturation and ripening is achieved through complex metabolic processes that are regulated by both developmental and hormonal factors. while hormones such as auxin, abscisic acid and cytokinins have all been linked to the ripening process  <cit> , the best characterised hormone is ethylene, due to its extreme ripening effect in many fruit. ethylene is synthesised in a simple three-step pathway from methionine, through s-adenosyl methionine synthetase , 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase  and acc oxidase   <cit> . all these genes are associated with multi-gene families, and in many plants acs has been shown to be a rate-limiting step for ethylene biosynthesis  <cit> . the acs gene family consist of three classes of genes, depending on the presence of destabilisation elements in the carboxy  termini  <cit>  that are regulated by the f-box genes ethylene over producer   <cit> . in fruit with autocatalytic ethylene-associated ripening, specific members of each of these biosynthetic gene-families are associated with ripening, which, when suppressed result in a loss or reduction in ripening is observed .

fruit perceive ethylene through a multi-step signalling pathway that begins with the binding of ethylene to a two-component transmembrane receptor complex found at the endoplasmic reticulum . multiple ethylene receptor and ethylene sensor complexes have been identified in tomato and arabidopsis that have also been shown to bind ethylene. the binding of ethylene to these receptors suppresses a mostly linear pathway that ultimately leads to the stabilisation of the ein <dig> family of transcription factors which regulate ethylene-responsive genes, reviewed  <cit> . transcription factors such as the squamosa binding protein , colourless non ripening   <cit> , ethylene response factors , as well as various mads-box genes regulate downstream ripening genes  <cit> . in tomato, strawberry, apple, banana and grape, maturation and pre-ethylene ripening events have also been associated with the mads-box transcription factor class of genes linked to floral organ identity. these include the sepallata -like ripening inhibitor  , fruitful -like tdr <dig>  <cit>  and the agamous -like tagl <dig> , which interact with one another to switch on ripening-associated genes such as those involved in ethylene biosynthesis .

ripening of yellow-fleshed actinidia chinensis ‘hort16a’ fruit is a complex and a highly co-ordinated process that involves changes in flesh texture  <cit>  and colour  <cit> , conversion of starch to soluble carbohydrates  <cit>  and the development of taste and aroma compounds  <cit> . a major ripening change in actinidia spp. is textural, from a firm texture  firmness) to a soft melting texture . the softening of kiwifruit to eating ripeness  occurs largely in the absence of any detectable ethylene  <cit> , although firm fruit may be extremely responsive to exogenously applied ethylene  <cit> . this capacity to respond to ethylene develops progressively in the fruit whilst on the vine  <cit> . when mapped to the phenological biologische bundesanstalt, bundessortenamt und chemische industrie  development scale  <cit> , the initial phase of ripening  occurs in the apparent absence of ethylene production . this is similar to the progression of ripening observed in ‘non-climacteric’ fruit such as grape. however, although no ethylene production is detected during phase  <dig> ripening, the ethylene inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene  can delay the rapid softening effect, suggesting a response to basal ethylene levels in the fruit  <cit> . once the fruit are soft , there is a second ripening phase  in which autocatalytic ethylene production is associated with significant increases in volatile ester and terpene synthesis  <cit>  and senescence   <cit> . hence, even though kiwifruit are largely referred to as an autocatalytic ethylene responsive fruit   <cit> , physiological evidence shows that kiwifruit behave differently from a typical climacteric fruit, such as avocado, banana or tomato. instead, it should be considered towards one end of a non-climacteric – climacteric continuum, where ethylene production occurs at the end of the ripening process.

genomic technologies such as expressed sequence tag  sequencing  <cit> , molecular maps  <cit>  and transformation protocols  <cit>  have greatly assisted in understanding of actinidia species at the molecular level. a number of studies have identified individual members of the ripening-associated ethylene biosynthetic genes aco, acs and sam synthase  <cit> , and ethylene signalling components, including constitutive triple response , ethylene response sensor  and ethylene response  <dig> -like genes  <cit> . in this study, we utilised genomic information from a.chinensis ‘hongyang’  <cit>  to identify ethylene-related genes and known controllers of fruit ripening, and investigated their expression at key time points over fruit maturation and ripening, to better understand the unusual ripening process observed in kiwifruit.

RESULTS
characterisation of maturation and ethylene responses in a. chinensis
a two dimensional developmental stage x ethylene response time study of a. chinensis ‘hort16a’ fruit was conducted by sequentially harvesting fruit at weekly intervals from 140 days after full bloom  to  <dig> dafb . this time frame was chosen to cover kiwifruit maturation and phase  <dig> ripening as described previously by richardson et al.  <cit>  from a mature fruit at stage  <dig> on the bbch scale  to fruit undergoing on-vine softening at stage  <dig> . each week, a batch of  <dig> fruit was assessed at harvest  for physiological attributes such as soluble sugar content , outer pericarp colour, firmness, and ethylene emission . each week, four batches of  <dig> fruit were also treated with one of three concentrations of the ethylene analogue propylene  and ethylene , for 1 day and then transferred into air. as a control,  <dig> fruit were left untreated. physiological attributes of treated and untreated fruit were assessed  <dig>   <dig> and 5 days after harvest .fig.  <dig> two dimensional developmental stage x response time schema. developmental stage/dimension 1: fruit were harvested weekly from  <dig> to 224 days after full bloom . fruit were assessed for a range of physiological parameters immediately at harvest . developmental stage is given using the bbch stage described in  <cit> . immature fruit  contained 80 % black seeds, and 100 % at bbch  <dig> and all following stages. phase  <dig> ripening  occurs in the apparent absence of ethylene production. phase  <dig> ripening  is associated with autocatalytic ethylene production, volatile ester and terpene synthesis and senescence. response time/dimension 2: after harvest, fruit were treated with either propylene, ethylene or stored in air for 24 h. fruit were then transferred to air and assessed for a range of physiological parameters at the points indicated by vertical bars between  <dig> and 5 days after harvest . tissues selected for a mrna-seq screen are indicated with a red text/bar and those selected for qpcr with a bold text/bar

fruit harvested over the 14-week period showed a well documented progression of ripening, with fully black seed observed at  <dig> dafb . flesh colour change from a green hue angle  to yellow  started at  <dig> dafb, with the majority of colour change occurring by  <dig> dafb . soluble sugars started increasing at  <dig> dafb , while the start of softening occurred at  <dig> dafb, and rapidly increased at  <dig> dafb . during the experiment no detectable endogenous ethylene production was measured . at each time point, for each of these attributes, fruit kept for 5 days in air  at ambient temperatures showed little further ripening progression from fruit measured at harvest .

when treated with propylene or ethylene, at  <dig> dafb, all treatments induced a small increase in ssc 5 days after harvest, from  <dig>  % to 8 % . as the fruit matured, ssc increased in response to ethylene and propylene, with a maximum fold-change, between harvest and 5 days after treatment, at  <dig> dafb. at the beginning of the time course , the fruit did not soften when treated with ethylene or propylene. a small drop in firmness, was observed following a one-day treatment of high propylene or ethylene, for treatments at  <dig> dafb. the amount of ethylene-induced softening increased as the fruit matured, with a maximum softening response first observed in samples harvested at  <dig> dafb. interestingly, fruit harvested subsequently , displayed a reduced softening response to ethylene/propylene. the maximum softening response to ethylene was again observed for fruit harvested after  <dig> dafb . softening displayed dose dependent response, with lower concentrations of propylene showing reduced softening. as the fruit progressed through phase  <dig> ripening, less propylene was required to achieve a full softening response. finally, the propylene and ethylene treatments resulted in only a small effect on the rate of colour change within the five-day assessment period .

no endogenous ethylene was produced by fruit after propylene or ethylene treatments until  <dig> dafb . a significant amount of endogenous ethylene was produced  at this developmental point, five days after an ethylene or high propylene treatment. the amount of ethylene produced  between  <dig> and  <dig> dafb was significantly lower  . higher amounts of endogenous ethylene were again produced at  <dig> and  <dig> dafb. the reduced ethylene production observed between  <dig> and  <dig> dafb was consistent with a reduction in softening observed in the same period . this result was also seen in batches of fruit treated with high doses of propylene . this observation suggests that following maturation there is a developmental progression in phase  <dig> ripening through three stages; a start when the fruit are competent to respond to ethylene in a reduced manner but do not produce ethylene , a period where endogenous ethylene production is repressed , and finally a late stage after which endogenous ethylene production is not repressed .

alignment of physiological changes with development associated genes
physiological changes that were observed during maturation and the three stages of phase  <dig> ripening, were aligned with the expression of five previously reported ripening-associated genes  <cit> . rna was extracted from fruit at  <dig> dafb when no ripening-associated responses were observed ; from fruit at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dafb corresponding to the development of competency to respond to ethylene, and the breakdown of stored starches and finally from fruit at  <dig> and  <dig> dafb, with the start of on-vine softening. the treatment-time points selected were at harvest, after 24 h high propylene treatment , and 2 days later  .

in the ‘at-harvest’ samples through the maturation period, there were only small transcriptional changes observed in two soluble sugar-related genes  and sucrose synthase ) and the two softening-related genes  and expansin ) . the colour-related gene chlorophyll binding protein  showed a decrease in expression through phase  <dig> ripening. in fruit that were not treated with propylene the effect of harvest over three days was initially minimal, but at  <dig> dafb the sugar and cell wall related genes showed an increase in expression 1- <dig> days post harvest.fig.  <dig> relative expression changes of five selected kiwifruit genes in response to propylene treatments during late maturation and phase  <dig> ripening. fruit were harvested from 140- <dig> days after full bloom  and left in air or treated with  <dig>  μl.l- <dig> propylene  for 1 day. expression was determined at harvest, and 1 day and 3 days after harvest  using gene-specific primers for a. cbp: chlorophyll binding protein , associated with colour change; b. pe: pectin esterase  and c. exp: expansin , both associated with softening and d. β-am: β-amylase  and e. susa: sucrose synthase , both associated with sugar metabolism. mean expression values are given relative to acactin, using two independent biological replicates repeated four times. arrows show periods where expression is repressed



consistent with the physiology, all genes tested except cbp, showed no change in expression after propylene treatment at  <dig> dafb. from  <dig> dafb onwards, a range of expression changes were observed in response to propylene treatment. the soluble sugar-related genes susa and β-am showed similar expression patterns with up-regulation at 3 days after harvest  in  <dig> dafb fruit, no response at  <dig> dafb, transient up-regulation at  <dig> dah for fruit at  <dig> dafb, and a sustained up-regulation at both  <dig> dah and  <dig> dah in fruit from  <dig> dafb onwards. with the early ripening genes pe and exp, there was no response at  <dig> dafb, a transient up-regulation at  <dig> dah for fruit at  <dig> dafb, no response at  <dig> and  <dig> dafb, and a sustained up-regulation at  <dig> dah and  <dig> dah from  <dig> dafb onwards .

identification of genes associated with ethylene biosynthesis and transduction
as ethylene production and perception is central to the response-time dimension, we undertook a detailed study to identify all the ethylene biosynthetic and signal transduction genes in the kiwifruit genome  <cit> . using lists of the auto-annotated genes we searched for descriptors associated with ethylene biosynthetic and transduction pathways . ten annotated sam synthetase genes were identified, only one of which has been previously identified   <cit> . thirteen acc synthase-like genes were selected, of which only one  has been published  <cit> . in other species the acs proteins have been divided into three classes , depending on presence of phosphorylation sites  and a wvf and rlsf c-terminal toe  domain  which confers instability to the proteins. three acs proteins contained just the rlsf , one had both domains , and nine had neither of these domains  . acs proteins in class ii are rapidly degraded through the action of an f-box protein ethylene over producer ; and four eto-like genes were identified in the kiwifruit genome. there were ninety-four acc oxidase annotated genes, nine of which have been published  <cit> . alignment of the protein sequences of these gene models suggested that  <dig> had a primary structure similar to aco-like genes.table  <dig> numbers of a.chinensis genes associated with ethylene biosynthesis and transduction annotated in the ‘hongyang’ genome

in the ethylene detection and signal transduction pathway, nine annotated ethylene receptors were identified in the annotated kiwifruit gene models, four of which have been published  <cit>  . further analysis showed that two of these models did not have the all the receptor domains and one was truncated, suggesting these were not functional receptors. ethylene receptors fall into four main classes of genes, these include the ethylene response <dig> , ethylene response sensor1/never ripe , ethylene insensitive <dig>  and ethylene response <dig> etr2-like genes. kiwifruit had representative genes in all these gene classes. the transcriptional control of the ethylene signal is through ethylene insensitive <dig>  and ethylene responsive factor/apetala <dig>  class of genes. in the annotated kiwifruit genes seven ein3-like genes were observed, and  <dig> erf/ap2-like genes, of which  <dig> had a conserved dna binding domain.

identification of ripening associated genes using a mrna-seq screen and expression analysis of selected genes
genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis, ethylene response but also transcription factors involved during fruit maturation and ripening belong to large multigene families . to select specific ethylene associated genes to analyse further, we used an rna-seq screen to identify genes within the  <dig> dimensional space, by selecting time points along the two boundaries. in the ethylene response time dimension, samples were harvested from fruit at  <dig> dafb after exogenous treatment with 100 μl.l- <dig> ethylene for 24 h, immediately following the ethylene treatment , 1 day  and 3 days  following treatment. along the developmental stage dimension we chose harvest samples through phase  <dig> ripening . .

the expression of each of the ethylene biosynthetic and signal transduction associated genes identified in the kiwifruit genome was examined in this screen, and genes that appeared to be upregulated in the ethylene response time dimension at  <dig> dafb were identified. of the ten sam synthetase genes, three had high  rpkm values throughout the experiment , and two appeared to be upregulated with ethylene  . of the thirteen acs genes, two were strongly upregulated with ethylene , and acs <dig> belonging to class iii). of the  <dig> aco genes, three were strongly upregulated by ethylene . the ers <dig> and etr <dig> classes of ethylene receptors also showed upregulation in expression .

the expression patterns of four ethylene-related genes with the biggest changes in rpkm values in the response-time dimension in each gene family  were assessed by qpcr at harvest and at time points previously described . in fruit at harvest during phase  <dig> ripening, sam <dig>  acs <dig> and aco2/ <dig> did not increase in expression, while etr <dig> showed an increase during phase  <dig> ripening. there was no increase in acs <dig> expression in air treated fruit over the 3 day period, but aco2/ <dig> and etr <dig> both showed an increase as the fruit went into the late phase  <dig> ripening stage .fig.  <dig> expression of selected kiwifruit genes associated with ethylene biosynthesis and perception. fruit were harvested from 140- <dig> days after full bloom  and treated in air or with  <dig>  μl.l- <dig> propylene  for 1 day. expression was determined at harvest, and 1 day and 3 days after harvest  using gene-specific primers for: a. acsam1: s-adenosyl methionine synthetase <dig> , b. acacs1: acc synthase <dig> , c, acaco2: acc oxidase <dig> , and d, acetr2: ethylene receptor <dig> . mean expression values are given relative to actin, using two independent biological replicates repeated four times



in propylene treated fruit, sam <dig> showed a sustained increase in expression at  <dig> dafb, and as the fruit underwent phase <dig> ripening  a transient increase in expression was observed. acs <dig> showed no response at  <dig> dafb and  <dig> dafb and a transient increase in expression at  <dig> and  <dig> dafb. there was a minor response at  <dig> dafb and then a partial sustained response at  <dig> dafb. the aco2/ <dig> and etr <dig> genes had more complex responses, with aco2/ <dig> showing low transient response at  <dig> dafb, a low sustained response at  <dig> dafb and  <dig> dafb, a transient response at  <dig> dafb and a high sustained response at  <dig> dafb onwards. etr <dig> had no response at  <dig> dafb to ethylene and then low sustained response at  <dig> dafb, no response at  <dig> dafb, a transient response at  <dig> dafb, and an increasing sustained response at  <dig> and  <dig> dafb.

regulators associated with competence to ripen
the mads-box class of genes have been shown to be key regulators of ripening in other fruit species. these include the tomato genes slrin , sltdr <dig>  and sltagl <dig> . the complex intron/exon structure and alternative splicing of the mads-box genes makes the automated annotation of this class of genes difficult. the automated prediction of mads-box genes in the kiwifruit genome is therefore not accurate. indeed, of the three kiwifruit sepallata genes published  <cit> , only the sep <dig> and sep <dig> are annotated in the ‘hongyang’ genome sequence. notably, sep <dig>  was absent from the gene models, as was ful <dig> . there were, a further two gene models that showed high similarity to the slrin dna binding domain. when examined in more detail, these acsep-like genes showed lower homology to slrin across the whole protein sequence, with the sep <dig> gene displaying the highest homology  throughout the entire gene . a scan of the mrna-seq expression data for all genes with a computer assigned mads-box function, identified a fourth mads-box gene  with a large change in expression during maturation. this gene was closest to the apetala <dig>  class of mads-box genes.

the expression of the closest kiwifruit rin/ful/tagl1- and ap3- like mads-box genes over phase <dig> ripening, with and without propylene showed that the mads-box gene sep4/rin showed a decrease in expression as the fruit progressed through phase  <dig> ripening, and early in phase  <dig> ripening  showed little response to the propylene treatment. however after  <dig> dafb there was a transient 4-fold up-regulation in expression with the propylene treatment. this transient increase continued to  <dig> dah as the fruit went into rapid softening  . ful-like increased four-fold as the fruit matured . when the fruit were treated with propylene there was no difference in this induction, showing this gene acts independently of ethylene. at early phase  <dig> ripening  the tagl <dig> gene showed a two-fold increase in expression with an propylene treatment and following harvest. however this increase was not observed later in phase  <dig> ripening . the ap3-like gene was highly expressed at  <dig> dafb and had a 4-fold decrease in expression as the fruit entered phase  <dig> ripening. when treated with propylene this gene was rapidly downregulated .fig.  <dig> relative expression changes of mads box genes in response to propylene treatments during late maturation and phase  <dig> ripening. fruit were harvested from 140- <dig> days after full bloom  and treated in air or with  <dig>  μl.l- <dig> propylene  for 1 day. expression was determined at harvest, and 1 day and 3 days after harvest  using gene-specific primers for: a. sep4/rin , b. tdr4/ful , c. tagl <dig> , d. ap <dig> . mean expression values are given relative to actin, using two independent biological replicates repeated four times. e a comparison of sep4/rin response to p- <dig> treatment and tdr4/ful. sep4/rin showed a decrease in expression through maturity  and a transient upregulation with propylene. tdr4/ful has little increase in expression until  <dig> dafb, then increases . it has no significant response to propylene. significance response to propylene compared to harvest time point 



transcriptional control of the sep4/rin like gene
a  <dig>  kb region upstream of the transcriptional start, was firstly scanned for potential rin-like carg sequences. in tomato the preference rin binding site is ccaatag, but rin can also bind to a more general c6g carg box  <cit> . in the kiwifruit genome sequence there were two carg sequences within the first 2 kb of the sep4/rin promoter. also within this promoter is a potential ein <dig> binding site gact), as well as a ps <dig> sequence that ein <dig> has been shown to bind to  <cit>  . to test whether these sites are functional, the  <dig>  kb fragment was inserted into a luciferase reporter construct  <cit>  and transiently co-injected into nicotiana benthamiana leaves with the kiwifruit sep4/rin gene driven by a 35s promoter. it was found that sep4/rin was unable to transactivate the rin promoter. when the  <dig>  kb promoter fragment was co-infiltrated with three kiwifruit ein <dig> transcription factors driven by a 35s promoter, it was shown that the ethylene associated ein3-like genes could transactivate the promoter .fig.  <dig>

the sep <dig> rin-like gene induces ethylene production in fruit
in other species, there has been a strong association between the mads-box gene rin and ethylene biosynthesis. for example, the slrin gene binds and activates itself and slacs <dig>  <cit> . because of the close similarity with slrin, and expression pattern, the construct containing the sep4/rin gene driven by a 35s promoter was tested transiently in mature a. eriantha fruit  <cit> . a.erinantha fruit were chosen as they are amenable to transient expression, and produce very low amounts of ethylene at ripening  <cit> . transiently injecting agrobacterium containing the 35s:acsep4/rin construct into mature fruit produced a consistent increase in endogenous ethylene compared with three controls, water injection, agrobacterium alone and agrobacterium containing a 35s:gfp  gene construct .

discussion
during development in all fruits, there is a period when the fruit becomes competent to ripen. this is a major change in the fruit’s properties, as it alters the fruit to be more attractive to seed-dispersing organisms, and usually coincides with seed maturation. the switch is often facilitated by large changes in phytohormone production, especially ethylene. in model fruit species such as tomato and grape there is growing molecular understanding of how some of the key switches regulate this transition. in tomato, ripening is predominantly regulated by ethylene, whilst in grape ripening ethylene has a relatively minor role. at the molecular level the best studied regulator is the rin mads-box gene, which acts in a heterotetrameric complex with ful/tdr <dig> ful <dig> and/or tagl <dig> to bind and activate many genes associated with fruit ripening  <cit> . rin is highly and constantly up-regulated during fruit ripening in tomato  <cit> , banana  <cit> , strawberry  <cit> , and apple  <cit> , and in tomato the ful/tdr <dig> rin complex has been shown to bind and activate the promoter of the ethylene biosynthesis genes acs <dig>  and rin itself  <cit> . in this study we have shown that a rin-like gene   <cit> , following maturation  the expression of this kiwifruit rin-like gene decreases . this suggests that in grape and kiwifruit rin cannot auto-activate itself, and even suggests the presence of an additional repression during this time. ethylene  is able to induce rin expression in tomato and kiwifruit, however in kiwifruit, subsequent removal of ethylene causes this gene to be downregulated again , further supporting a repression mechanism. transient experiments performed in tobacco indicate that the kiwifruit rin does not activate rin and there is no increase in rin expression when the acful is developmentally turned on, or when rin expression is induced with ethylene, suggesting a mechanism by which the hybrid ripening is controlled .fig.  <dig> a simplified model of the role of rin-like genes during fruit maturation and ripening in different scpecies. rin expression  correlates with ethylene production . once the fruit is competent to ripen  rin can induce ethylene dependent ripening , but in the absence of ethylene , ethylene independent ripening progresses . in tomato rin activates both ethylene and itself   <cit>  progressing pr <dig> and pr <dig> ripening simultaneously, while in kiwifruit and grape there is a down regulation of rin expression following competence to ripen    <cit>  allowing pr <dig> ripening to occur independently. in kiwifruit this repression can be reversed later in maturity, or with the application of ethylene. kiwifruit thus shows a hybrid ethylene independent-dependent mechanism with phase  <dig> ripening being likely to be controlled by sep4/rin



while the controllers of kiwifruit phase- <dig> ripening  are yet to be fully identified, a key candidate is the ful/tdr4-like gene , which in tomato has been shown to be a major controller of many ripening factors  <cit> . in kiwifruit the increase in ful coincides with the start of rapid softening  suggesting a mechanism by which cell wall related genes such as pe and exp  are upregulated. this would be consistent with tomato, where authors have postulated that slful/tdr <dig> controls an ethylene independent ripening process  <cit> , and our results in kiwifruit would support the suggestion that this occurs independently of rin. in the presence of ethylene , these cell wall genes are upregulated, which could be due to the presence of rin or other ethylene-related cis-elements in their promoters. the switch between a transient activation of these genes and sustained activation late in maturity may be explained by the developmentally controlled upregulation of ful. the third kiwifruit gene of the mads-box complex, tagl <dig> does not appear to change during development during phase- <dig> ripening. tagl <dig> is partially upregulated with ethylene similar to tomato  <cit> , but not in a sustained manner .

in this study a third floral identity-like gene , showed a large decrease in expression as the fruit transitioned into ripening competence. an ap <dig> tomato homologue tdr <dig> is also expressed early in fruit maturation, is down-regulated at ripening, and interestingly showed a possible interaction with tdr <dig>  in a yeast 2-hybrid experiment  <cit> . consistent with that of arabidopsis ap <dig>  the expression appears to be auto-inhibitory  <cit> , with a decrease in expression in ripening fruit, and it is inhibited by ethylene. whether this gene plays a role in the regulation of ripening is yet to be seen.

as the fruit mature there is an increase in sensitivity to ethylene, with the lower concentrations of propylene inducing a more significant response over time . each of the ripening responses shows different sensitivities to ethylene and propylene, with sugars showing an early high sensitivity and fruit firmness showing a lower sensitivity. this implies there is a similar sensitivity dependency mechanism occurring in kiwifruit as proposed in apple  <cit> . interestingly, kiwifruit colour change shows little effect from the treatment with ethylene, suggesting that de-greening is probably associated with developmental control rather than ethylene. at the transcriptional level, ethylene  causes a reduction in cbp transcription, showing that some colour-related mechanisms are transcriptionally modulated by ethylene. the lack of phenotypic changes may be however partially due to the short 5-day assessment period used in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
with the development of more sensitive detectors, and the use of molecular tools outside the classic model organisms, the distinctions between autocatalytic ethylene associated  and non ethylene associated  fruit ripening has eroded  <cit> . here we propose a model  in which, through changes in the regulation of ethylene regulating rin-like genes and ethylene independent ful/tdr <dig> like genes, the differences between fruit ripening between these two classes are not so dissimilar.
