BACKGROUND
bordetella pertussis is an important causative agent of pertussis, which is among the ten infectious diseases with the highest morbidity and mortality worldwide. after introduction of whole-cell vaccines  in the 1950's, pertussis incidence has decreased significantly. although efficacious, wp vaccines were also found to be reactogenic. therefore, acellular vaccines  comprising purified b. pertussis proteins have been developed.

toll-like receptor  <dig>  is the receptor for lipopolysaccharide  in mammals  <cit> . since b. pertussis is a gram-negative bacterium, tlr <dig> is likely to play an important role in natural immunity to b. pertussis infection. indeed, we and others have shown that tlr <dig> is critical for b. pertussis clearance and ensuing adaptive immunity in non-vaccinated mice  <cit> . furthermore, tlr <dig> influenced lung pathology and production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as il-1β and tnf-α, after b. pertussis infection  <cit> .

since wp are prepared from b. pertussis and  contain lps it may be suggested that tlr <dig> influences wp efficacy. in our model of wp and ap vaccination and b. pertussis challenge, lung pathology and tnf-α expression were induced by vaccination  and challenge  <cit> . also, type i hypersensitivity, a th <dig> driven response, was induced by vaccination  and challenge  <cit> . in that study, however, a role for tlr <dig> was not addressed.

we have identified an association of the minor allele of rs <dig> in tlr <dig> with a lower pertussis toxin -igg level in wp-vaccinated children  <cit> . the mouse and human studies together prompted us to analyze the relative role of tlr <dig> in wp vaccination of mice.

here we show that tlr <dig> plays an important role in natural immunity, wp and  ap efficacy, and induction of th <dig> and th <dig> responses, confirming observations by higgins et al.  <cit> . moreover, we show that the humoral response to vaccination  is not influenced by tlr <dig> . tlr <dig> is critical for lung pathology and enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine production after wp vaccination and challenge, and diminishes th <dig> responses after both wp and ap vaccination and challenge.

RESULTS
b. pertussis colonization of the lungs
tlr4-deficient c3h/hej and wild-type control c3h/heouj mice  were vaccinated twice with 1/ <dig> human dose  wp, 1/ <dig> hd ap, or adjuvant, and challenged intranasally with b. pertussis. three and seven days after infection, mice were sacrificed and the number of bacteria in their lungs was determined. vaccinated mice generally showed a lower number of bacteria than adjuvant-treated animals, while tlr4-deficient mice generally showed a higher number of bacteria than wild-type animals . adjuvant-treated tlr4-deficient mice showed an increasing number of bacteria from day  <dig> till day  <dig> , while similarly treated wild-type animals showed a decreasing number in this time period . tlr4-deficient mice that were wp-vaccinated before challenge failed to show a decreasing number of bacteria from day  <dig> till day  <dig>  while similarly treated wild-type animals did show a decreasing number in this time period . in ap-vaccinated mice of either strain the number of bacteria was similar between day  <dig> and day  <dig> 

these data show  the important role of tlr <dig> in the natural defense to b. pertussis infection and confirms our earlier findings  <cit> ,  the important role of tlr <dig> in wp-induced clearance, and  that vaccine-induced clearance is faster after ap vaccination than after wp vaccination, regardless of the presence of tlr <dig>  this latter notion is supported by the higher clearance in ap-vaccinated than wp-vaccinated mice at day  <dig> but not day  <dig> in either mouse strain.

vaccination-induced protection, i.e. the difference in the number of bacteria between vaccinated and control mice, was lower in tlr4-deficient mice than in wild-type animals , except for ap vaccination at day  <dig> where this effect was not statistically significant , - <dig>  and - <dig>  , - <dig>  and - <dig>  , and - <dig>  and - <dig>   for tlr4-deficient and wild-type mice, respectively).

collectively, these data show that tlr <dig> is not only involved in the natural defense to b. pertussis infection but also in vaccination-induced protection to this pathogen, both after wp and after ap vaccination.

ptx-, fha-, and prn-specific igg
serum was taken  <dig> hours before challenge and  <dig> and  <dig> days after challenge, and analyzed for igg specific for pertussis toxin , filamentous hemagglutinin , and pertactin  <dig> . ptx-igg was detectable only in ap-vaccinated mice . before challenge the ptx-igg level was not affected by tlr <dig>  at days  <dig> and  <dig> after challenge tlr4-deficient ap-vaccinated mice showed a significantly lower ptx-igg level than similarly treated wild-type animals. in each mouse strain the ptx-igg level was similar before and after challenge.

fha-igg was detectable in both wp- and ap-vaccinated mice. ap-vaccinated mice showed a higher fha-igg level than wp-vaccinated animals . both before and after challenge the fha-igg level was not affected by tlr <dig>  generally, both wp- and ap-vaccinated wild-type but not tlr4-deficient mice showed a lower fha-igg level after challenge than before.

prn-igg was detectable in both wp- and ap-vaccinated mice. generally, ap-vaccinated mice showed a higher prn-igg level than wp-vaccinated animals. before challenge the prn-igg level was not affected by tlr <dig>  rather unexpectedly after challenge the prn-igg level was higher in wp- and ap-vaccinated tlr4-deficient mice than in similarly treated wild-type animals.

collectively, these data show that before challenge tlr <dig> does not affect vaccination-induced ptx-, fha-, and prn-igg levels. after challenge, the ptx-igg level is lower in tlr4-deficient mice than in wild-type animals, while the reverse is true for prn-igg. the fha-igg level is unaffected by the tlr <dig> mutation.

weight gain
mice were weighed immediately before challenge, and  <dig> and  <dig> days after challenge . paired sample testing revealed weight loss of adjuvant controls; this was significant in case of tlr4-deficient mice at day  <dig>  and a trend in other cases. weight gain was seen in wp- but not ap-vaccinated tlr4-deficient mice at days  <dig> and  <dig>  and in wp- and ap-vaccinated wild-type animals at day  <dig> 

weight gain in wp- and ap-vaccinated tlr4-deficient mice was higher than in adjuvant controls at days  <dig> and  <dig>  while in wp- and ap-vaccinated wild-type animals this was the case only at day  <dig>  a lower weight gain due to the tlr <dig> mutation was seen only in ap-vaccinated mice at day  <dig> 

taken together, these data show that vaccination but not  tlr <dig> affects weight gain during the first  <dig> days after b. pertussis challenge.

histological changes
we have previously shown that after challenge wp- and ap-vaccinated mice revealed increased lung pathology compared to adjuvant-treated animals, with wp-vaccinated mice showing more severe pathology than ap-vaccinated animals  <cit> . here we addressed whether tlr <dig> influenced lung pathology.

lung lesions were scored  <dig> days after challenge . in wild-type mice wp vaccination resulted in a stronger challenge-induced peribronchiolitis, perivasculitis, and alveolitis compared to adjuvant treatment and ap vaccination, rather similar to our previous findings  <cit> . challenge-induced alveolitis was weaker in wp- and ap-vaccinated tlr4-deficient mice and in ap-vaccinated wild-type animals, compared to their adjuvant controls. no treatment effects on hypertrophy of the bronchiolar mucous cells were seen in either strain, while eosinophilia was absent in all groups.

challenge-induced lung pathology was less severe in tlr4-deficient wp-vaccinated mice than in similarly treated wild-type animals. no effect of the tlr <dig> mutation was seen after challenge of ap-vaccinated and adjuvant-treated mice.

these data show that challenge-induced pathology in wp-vaccinated animals is tlr4-dependent.

cytokine gene expression in lung tissue
b. pertussis infection induced tnf-α, il- <dig>  and il-1β production and tlr <dig> was shown to play a role in this process  <cit> . thus, proinflammatory cytokines were analyzed. next, wp-vaccination induced th <dig> and th <dig> cells, these cells were critical for clearance and their induction was shown to be dependent on tlr <dig>  <cit> . thus, th <dig> and th <dig> cytokines were analyzed. finally, pertussis vaccination  before challenge induced a th2-dependent response  <cit>  and this response could be skewed towards a th <dig> response by adding lps analogs  <cit> . thus, th <dig> cytokines were analyzed.

post-challenge lung lobes were subjected to real-time pcr. the fold change is relative to lung tissue of untreated c57bl/6j mice. irrespective of prior vaccination, il-1α mrna expression is lower in challenged c3h mice than in untreated c57bl/ <dig> mice, while the reverse is true for the other cytokines analyzed.

proinflammatory cytokines
generally, in both strains of mice wp and ap vaccination resulted in lower challenge-induced il-1α, il-1β, and tnf-α expression than adjuvant treatment . tlr4-deficient adjuvant-treated mice showed higher challenge-induced il-1α and il-1β expression than similarly treated wild-type animals at day  <dig>  tlr4-deficient wp-vaccinated mice showed lower challenge-induced il-1β and tnf-α expression than similarly treated wild-type animals at day  <dig> 

th1/th <dig> cytokines
generally, in both strains of mice wp and ap vaccination resulted in lower challenge-induced ifn-γ and il- <dig> expression than adjuvant treatment, while for ap vaccination this was also seen for il- <dig>  adjuvant-treated and ap-vaccinated mice did not show tlr4-dependent effects on post-challenge th1/th <dig> cytokines. tlr4-deficient wp-vaccinated mice did, however, show lower challenge-induced ifn-γ, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> expression than similarly treated wild-type animals at day  <dig> 

th <dig> cytokines
generally, in both strains of mice wp and ap vaccination resulted in higher challenge-induced il- <dig> and il- <dig> expression than adjuvant treatment. adjuvant-treated mice did not show tlr4-dependent effects on post-challenge th <dig> cytokines. tlr4-deficient ap-vaccinated mice showed higher challenge-induced il- <dig> expression than similarly treated wild-type animals. this effect of the tlr <dig> mutation was also seen for wp-vaccinated mice at day  <dig> 

in summary, in both strains of mice wp and ap vaccination resulted in lower challenge-induced il-1α, il-1β, tnf-α, ifn-γ, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> expression, and higher challenge-induced il- <dig> and il- <dig> expression. exceptions to this overall picture were higher tnf-α and il- <dig> expression in wp-vaccinated wild-type mice.

tlr <dig> mediated  in adjuvant-treated mice, lower expression of il-1α and il-1β at day  <dig>   in wp-vaccinated mice, higher expression of il-1β and tnf-α, and of th <dig> and th <dig> cytokines at day  <dig>  and  in wp- and ap-vaccinated mice, higher expression of il- <dig> at days  <dig> and  <dig> after challenge.

in short, functional tlr <dig> results in a lower lung inflammatory response after infection, a higher inflammatory response and th1/th <dig> response after wp vaccination and challenge, and a lower th <dig> response after wp and ap vaccination and challenge.

cytokine production by bronchial lymph node cells
cell suspensions from post-challenge bronchial ln were con a-stimulated ex vivo. from the panel of cytokines tested , il-1α and il- <dig> were excluded from further analysis because for these cytokines one or more of the treatment groups showed concentrations below the detection limit for  <dig> or more of the  <dig> samples tested.

generally, vaccinated mice showed lower challenge-induced ifn-γ and il- <dig> production than adjuvant-treated animals at day  <dig> . tlr4-deficient adjuvant-treated mice showed lower challenge-induced ifn-γ and il- <dig> production than similarly treated wild-type animals at day  <dig>  tlr4-deficient wp-vaccinated mice showed lower challenge-induced il- <dig> production than similarly treated wild-type mice at day  <dig> 

il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> production was 13-, 11-, and 9-fold higher, respectively, in wp-vaccinated than in adjuvant-treated tlr4-deficient mice at day  <dig> after challenge . no strain- or additional treatment-related effects on the production of these cytokines were seen. no strain- or treatment-related effects on tnf-α production were seen .

together, in bronchial ln cells functional tlr <dig> results in a higher th1/th <dig> response after infection. moreover, in these cells functional tlr <dig> results in a higher th <dig> and a lower th <dig> response after wp vaccination and challenge.

cytokine production by splenocytes
cell suspensions from post-challenge spleens were stimulated ex vivo with heat-killed b. pertussis. from the panel of cytokines tested , il-1α, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and ifn-γ were excluded from further analysis because for these cytokines one or more of the treatment groups showed concentrations below the detection limit for  <dig> or more of the  <dig> samples tested.

vaccination did not affect challenge-induced il- <dig> production, while tlr4-deficient mice showed lower challenge-induced production of this cytokine than wild-type animals. tlr4-deficient adjuvant-treated mice showed lower challenge-induced tnf-α production than similarly treated wild-type animals at days  <dig> and  <dig>  while tlr4-deficient wp-vaccinated mice showed lower challenge-induced production of this cytokine than similarly treated wild-type animals at day  <dig> 

together, these data show that in the spleen regardless of vaccination functional tlr <dig> results in a higher il- <dig> response after infection. functional tlr <dig> also results in a higher tnf-α response after infection, and after wp vaccination and challenge.

discussion
here we have shown that after infection of non-vaccinated tlr4-deficient mice the number of bacteria, and lung il-1α and il-1β expression are higher than in similarly treated wild-type controls, while bronchial ln cell ifn-γ and il- <dig> production and splenocyte tnf-α production are lower. table  <dig> summarizes our findings. in non-vaccinated but also in vaccinated animals, before challenge no effect of the tlr <dig> mutation on ptx-, fha-, and prn-igg levels is seen. after challenge of wp-vaccinated tlr4-deficient mice, the number of bacteria, prn-igg level, and lung il- <dig> expression are higher compared to wild-type controls, and lung pathology is diminished, while lung il-1β, tnf-α, ifn-γ, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> expression and bronchial ln cell il- <dig> production are lower. after challenge of ap-vaccinated tlr4-deficient mice the number of bacteria, prn-igg level, and lung il- <dig> expression are higher compared to wild-type controls, while ptx-igg level and weight gain are lower. collectively, these data show an important role for tlr <dig> in infection, being bacterial clearance, induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and induction of th <dig> and th <dig> responses. tlr <dig> is also important in the challenge response after wp vaccination, being bacterial clearance but also concomitant pathology, induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and induction of th <dig>  th <dig>  and th <dig> responses. tlr <dig> plays an important role also in the challenge response after ap vaccination, with a more limited number of parameters affected, being bacterial clearance and induction of the th <dig> response. our data confirm previous data by higgins et al.  <cit> , who showed an important role of tlr <dig> in induction of th <dig> cells by infection, in bacterial clearance after wp- and ap-vaccination, and induction of th <dig> and th <dig> cells by wp but not ap vaccination.

concerns have been raised with respect to the relative efficacy of ap as compared to wp, and also of vaccines administered simultaneously with ap, such as diphtheria, tetanus, polio, and haemophilus influenzae b  vaccines  <cit> . a cause for the limited efficacy of ap may be that, in contrast to wp, they do not contain lps. in mice th <dig>  <cit>  and th <dig> cells are induced by wp vaccination, but not  by ap vaccination, and the induction of these th <dig> and th <dig> cells is tlr4-dependent  <cit> . importantly, th <dig> and th <dig> cells are critical for clearing a b. pertussis challenge  <cit> . these findings show the importance of tlr <dig>  in generating immune responses induced by pertussis vaccines, at least in mice. the efficacy of vaccines that do not contain lps, such as viral vaccines and bacterial subunit vaccines can be improved by supplementation with tlr <dig> agonists that show no or little endotoxin activity. we have shown that supplementing the bacterial subunit vaccine ap with the tlr <dig> agonist monophosphoryl lipid a improved its efficacy  <cit> .

on day  <dig> after infection vaccinated mice had a lower number of bacteria in their lungs than adjuvant controls. this may have affected the cytokine levels measured. therefore, we plan to study cytokine responses earlier in infection to determine their effects on bacterial clearance.

our data show that tlr <dig> affects the humoral response to vaccination only after challenge. this suggests a tlr4-dependent effect of bacterial challenge on the humoral response, and that tlr <dig> plays a more important role in the challenge phase than in the vaccination phase. transfer studies from vaccinated tlr4-deficient mice to naive tlr4-sufficient animals and subsequent challenge, or studies using conditional tlr4-knockout mice should settle this issue.

our failure to detect ptx-igg in wp-vaccinated animals is in line with observations in both humans  <cit>  and mice  <cit>  that showed ap vaccines to induce a much higher ptx-igg level than wp vaccines. in rather contrast to a previous report where prn-igg could be detected in convalescent serum from b. parapertussis but not b. pertussis infected mice  <cit> , we did observe prn-igg in vaccinated mice. the lower fha- and prn-igg levels after challenge may be explained by ptx-mediated suppression of serum antibody levels after infection  <cit>  or by binding of the antibodies by the bacterial challenge.

we have identified an association of the minor allele of rs <dig> in tlr <dig> with a lower ptx-igg level in wp-vaccinated children  <cit> . as we did not detect ptx-igg after wp vaccination of mice, we cannot compare the data obtained in humans to those in mice.

here we show that tlr <dig> plays an important role in lung pathology induced by wp vaccination and challenge. until recently, it has been assumed that tissue damage is mediated by th <dig> cells  <cit> . we have previously shown, however, that th <dig> cells are not involved in lung pathology induced by wp vaccination and challenge, as t-bet ko mice that lack th <dig> cells showed similar pathology compared to wild-type controls  <cit> , suggesting that a different subset is involved. possibly, th <dig> cells may be the subset responsible for this pathology, as these cells are important in mediating tissue damage  <cit>  and are induced by wp vaccination in a tlr4-dependent way  <cit> . th <dig> cells are induced in the presence of il- <dig>  while regulatory t-cells are induced in the absence of this cytokine   <cit> . possibly, induction of il- <dig> by wp vaccination  <cit>  may play a role in the generation of th <dig> cells. whether indeed th <dig> cells are responsible for lung pathology after wp vaccination and challenge awaits further study.

our finding of infection-induced il- <dig> production is in line with the observation of il- <dig> production by human monocyte-derived dc after b. pertussis infection  <cit> . since il- <dig> is required for amplifying and/or stabilizing th <dig> cells  <cit> , both findings suggest th <dig> induction by b. pertussis infection.

it is intriguing but also complicating that not only lps but also ptx may play a role in the tlr4-dependent induction of th <dig> cells. ptx has tlr4-dependent adjuvant activity  <cit>  and is able to induce th <dig> cells  <cit> . it is likely, but not formally proven, that this latter effect is tlr4-dependent . vaccination with wp that is derived from ptx-deleted b. pertussis may clarify this issue.

we show that production of ifn-γ and il- <dig> by bronchial ln cells from non-vaccinated tlr4-deficient mice is lower than from wild-type controls, in line with previous observations for ifn-γ  <cit>  . this suggests that not only wp vaccination but also b. pertussis infection induces th <dig> and th <dig> cells in a tlr4-dependent way.

il- <dig> production by b. pertussis-stimulated splenocytes is lower when these cells are obtained from tlr4-deficient mice than from wild-type controls. challenge-induced pathology is similar between adjuvant-treated tlr4-deficient mice and similarly treated wild-type controls, and lower in wp-vaccinated tlr4-deficient mice than in their wild-type controls. together, these data suggest that in our model il- <dig> is not involved in limiting pathology, in contrast to a study by others  <cit> . our observations were made at day  <dig> after challenge, however, whereas the other study  <cit>  made these observations at day 14– <dig> 

a recent paper has shown that the number of bacteria in the lungs of b. pertussis infected tnf-α deficient mice was higher than in similarly treated wild-type controls  <cit> . in our study, b. pertussis-stimulated splenocytes from infected tlr4-deficient mice produce less tnf-α than cells from similarly treated wild-type controls. the lower systemic tnf-α response observed in our study may contribute to the higher number of bacteria in the lungs of tlr4-deficient mice. it has to be noted, however, that the differences in bacterial numbers between tnf-α deficient mice and their controls were not seen until day  <dig> after infection  <cit> .

two signal transduction pathways downstream of tlr <dig> have been identified, the myd88-dependent pathway and the myd88-independent  pathway. the former pathway involves the adaptor proteins tirap and myd <dig>  the latter one trif and tram  <cit> . the bacterial species from which lps originates, determines the pathway activated  <cit> . since wp is derived from b. pertussis, they harbor the same lps suggesting activation of the same pathway. wp, however, consists of glutaraldehyde-fixed bacteria, and its lps may thus activate a different pathway than lps from live b. pertussis  <cit> . to study possible differences in pathway activation, trif-deficient  and wild-type controls  were compared in our model. trif-deficient mice are readily available and are not deficient in other pathways besides trif/tram, while myd <dig> ko mice are not only deficient in myd88/tirap but also in the il-1r and il-18r pathways  <cit> . three days after infection, wp- and ap-vaccinated mice showed a ~500-fold lower colonization than non-vaccinated controls, and no differences in colonization were seen between trif-deficient and wild-type mice . this shows that the trif pathway is not involved in clearance of a b. pertussis infection, nor is it involved in wp or ap vaccine-induced clearance.

trif-deficient mice are strongly impaired in lps-induced cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and mhc class ii upregulation, as well as type i ifn production in macrophages in vitro, and cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig> upregulation in cd11+ dc in vivo. also, the cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell response is abolished when lps is used as adjuvant  <cit> . importantly, type i interferons promote memory t-cell proliferation  <cit> . thus, the lack of an effect of trif-deficiency suggests that clearance of a b. pertussis infection, as well as wp- and ap-induced immunity are also functional under conditions of severely reduced costimulation and  t-cell responses. this lack of an effect of trif-deficiency also suggests involvement of the myd88-dependent pathway. we set out to study this pathway, but breeding problems with myd <dig> ko mice prohibited these experiments. still, a role for myd <dig> is likely from a study by togbe et al.  <cit>  who showed a tirap- and myd88-dependent trif-independent response to lps in the lungs, including th <dig> cytokine production and neutrophil influx. both parameters are characteristic of b. pertussis challenge, as well as of wp but not ap vaccination and similar challenge  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that tlr <dig> does not affect the humoral response to vaccination. tlr <dig> is important in  natural defense to b. pertussis infection, and also in wp and ap vaccination-induced clearance,  challenge-induced lung pathology after wp vaccination,  induction of th <dig> and th <dig> responses by b. pertussis infection and also by wp vaccination and challenge, and  reduced th <dig> response after wp and ap vaccination and challenge. a summary of our findings is presented in figure  <dig>
