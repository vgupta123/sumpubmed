BACKGROUND
the orchestration of gene expression is accomplished through a wide variety of regulatory mechanisms. one of the most well-characterized of these mechanisms is regulation of transcription through the binding of transcription factors to regulatory dna sequence  <cit> . the dna sequences bound by transcription factors are generally short, the average binding site length being around 10 bp in eukaryotes  <cit> . other types of regulatory sequences are less well characterized; for example those sequences which become functional when transcribed into rna. the most well-known example of this kind of regulatory element is perhaps the ire , a hairpin loop found in the mrna of many genes involved in iron metabolism which helps to maintain iron homeostasis  <cit> .

detecting regulatory elements experimentally is time consuming  <cit> , and identifying appropriate experimental targets may be difficult. using straightforward computational methods for prediction of regulatory elements also presents issues; for example, prediction of transcription factor binding sites is usually accomplished by scanning a sequence of interest for matches to position-specific scoring matrices . these pssms  <cit>  describe the kinds of, generally short  <cit>  sequence motifs bound by these proteins. as such, the probability of finding a chance match in a sequence of any considerable length is high, and the majority of predicted transcription factor binding sites are therefore likely to have no functional role; a concept dubbed the ‘futility theorem’  <cit> . many other regulatory elements are also characterized by short sequence motifs, and so identification of these elements through straightforward sequence scanning methods is subject to the same problem.

phylogenetic footprinting is a method that can greatly reduce the search space when looking for functional regulatory elements  <cit> . it is based on the principle that functionally important sequence elements are more likely to be conserved over time than less  functional elements, leaving behind a ‘footprint’ of functionality. this approach can be highly successful at identifying functional regulatory elements, the specificity of detection increasing with the divergence times of the species used; for example >40 % of conserved non-coding elements  detected through a human-fugu   <cit>  comparison showed enhancer activity when tested  <cit> , as opposed to only 5 % of human-rodent cnes tested  <cit> . cne detection tends to drop sharply at taxonomic boundaries, for example sensitive blast analysis shows a clear alignment signal between similar loci of two drosophila species , but an almost complete lack of alignment between two more diverged dipteran species   <cit> .

the most deeply conserved cnes detected to date originated before the divergence of deuterostomes and protostomes, only four examples of which have been found so far. the first two sequences of this kind to be discovered were found conserved between a variety of deuterostomes and a cnidarian, nematostella vectensis  <cit> , dating back over  <dig> million years  <cit> . the other two conserved sequences that predate this split were, unlike the other two sequences, found to be present in species belonging to both deuterostomia and protostomia  <cit>  and date back at least  <dig> million years  <cit> .

here, we took advantage of the recent releases of various insect genomes to identify novel regulatory elements conserved across large  evolutionary distances. the majority of phylogenetic footprinting studies in insects use the model organism drosophila melanogaster as a central comparison species, aimed at finding regulatory elements conserved within the fast-evolving  <cit>  order diptera. for a new perspective, we here use the emerging model organism nasonia vitripennis, a member of the more slowly evolving order hymenoptera, as a central comparison species to identify conserved regulatory elements. the aim of this study was to characterize a small subset of deeply conserved sequences in the upstream region of genes, thus potentially capturing both novel transcriptional and translational regulatory elements. by using a sensitive alignment algorithm   <cit>  and ensuring that our analysis was conducted with a low false discovery rate, we identified a set of conserved sequences. among the sequences that we identified are both known regulatory elements and a variety of novel regulatory elements on or near genes with core regulatory or developmental roles, some of which could potentially represent novel classes of rna regulatory elements. we use our set of cnes to examine the nature of conserved regulatory elements and their evolution. we also report the discovery of, to our knowledge, the two most deeply and ubiquitously conserved regulatory elements yet identified in the animal kingdom which date back to the radiations of basal animal phyla and are likely over  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> million years old  <cit>  respectively.

RESULTS
identification of deeply conserved non-coding elements
in order to identify conserved regulatory elements, we performed a comparative analysis of  <dig> highly diverged insect genomes  on a locus-by-locus basis, scanning the 2 kb non-coding region upstream of the translation start site of each gene. n. vitripennis was used as the central species compared to all other species in a series of pairwise comparisons. the “seaweed algorithm"  <cit>  was used to perform alignments, performing over  <dig>  million optimal alignments of short sub-sequences per pair of 2 kb sequences upstream of orthologous genes. significantly aligned, overlapping sub-sequences were merged and regions in other species that mapped to the same sub-sequence in n. vitripennis were identified to yield one inclusive dataset .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships between species and genomic cne distribution. a phylogenetic tree showing the relationships and approximate divergence times between the insects used in the analysis. the number of conserved cnes at different branching points is plotted on the figure. phylogenetic relationships and divergence times from: inter-order  <cit> ; hymenoptera  <cit> ; lepidoptera  <cit> ; diptera  <cit> ; coleoptera  <cit> . b

as a control, we aligned pairs of randomly matched upstream non-coding sequences. the number of ‘conserved’ sequences detected in the control set at various alignment score thresholds can therefore be used to estimate the false discovery rate. we adjusted the algorithm parameters such that no conservation at all was detected in the control, and then used these parameters to align the truly orthologous sequences. sequences were pre-filtered for repetitive regions, and post-filtered for similarities to known coding sequences. at this very strict level of false discovery, we detected  <dig> cnes on or near  <dig> genes . each of these genes was given a combined conservation score  in the interval 0– <dig>  where anything above zero is considered statistically significant and one represents particularly strong conservation .

since the most closely related species in the analysis  diverged from nasonia approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , all of the  <dig> cnes have been conserved for at least this long. the cnes found in hymenoptera tend to be found in more than just two species; ~58 % of the hymenoptera-specific cnes are conserved in three species or more . focusing on the  <dig> genes with an associated cne, we expanded the analysis to a wider range of animals. a handful of cnes were found to be conserved at greater evolutionary distances;  <dig> cnes on or near  <dig> genes were found to have been conserved for at least  <dig> million years   <cit> . of these, one cne dates back to the common ancestor of mandibulata , and  <dig> cnes date further back to the radiations of basal animal phyla . these  <dig> anciently conserved cnes exhibit a high degree of overlap, with only two being specific to n. vitripennis and one other species.

relative position of cnes is conserved along with sequence
in order to investigate the properties of the cnes, we performed a series of analyses comparing the cnes with a control set of sequences. to obtain these control sequences, we adjusted the parameters of the algorithm to allow for the capture of false discoveries, and ran the alignments on randomly matched  pairs of sequences. by setting an appropriate threshold, we extracted and post-filtered a similar number of sequences to the cnes from the control set, representing the highest scoring non-orthologous sequence alignments. we term these sequences pseudo-cnes, as they are sequences that have high alignment scores, albeit below our conservation threshold, but lack orthology. as high-scoring non-orthologous sequences, these pseudo-cnes can be used as a comparison to elucidate important sequence properties about the true, orthologous cnes, as opposed to comparisons with sequences with randomized properties.

the gc content of the cnes contrasts starkly with the gc content of the pseudo cnes; the cnes have a mean gc content of 51 %, compared to 27 % in the pseudo cnes . this pattern of gc content is strongly associated with a peak of predicted nucleosome occupancy in the center of the cne , a markedly different population of over/under-represented transcription factor binding sites , and an underrepresentation of atg trinucleotides , although whether these are a cause or effect of the gc content disparity is unclear. the expected number of cpg dinucleotides based on the gc content  in the cnes does not significantly differ from the control , suggesting that there is no suppression or special use of these methylation-related dinucleotides in the conserved regions. the length of the cnes is strongly biased towards ~90 bp, a trend which is not generally apparent in the pseudo-cnes , perhaps indicative of the mode of mechanism of these conserved sequences.fig.  <dig> comparative analysis of cne sequence features. analysis of cne  properties in comparison with pseudo-cne controls . distributions were compared using the wilcoxon rank-sum test. a gc content. b cpg o/e. c cne length distribution. d cne position



when we consider the distance of the sequences from the translation start site of their associated gene, we see enrichment for adjacency among both the cnes and the pseudo-cnes, decreasing with distance . although the relative positions of the cnes and the pseudo-cnes are similar, the conservation of these distances across species is not. comparing the translation start site distance in n. vitripennis with the translation start site distance in the comparator species reveals that the distance of each pseudo-cne in n. vitripennis is completely uncorrelated with its distance in the comparator organism , whereas in the set of cnes there is a significant correlation between distances . this result shows that the position of cnes is important as well as the conserved sequence itself.fig.  <dig> conservation of relative cne positions. scatter plot showing the conservation of cne positions, comparing the cne position in nasonia  with its position in each comparator organism . conservation of position relative to translation start site is insignificant in the control  but significant among cnes 



cnes are tightly associated with developmental and regulatory genes
the  <dig> cnes that we identified here are associated with a specific class of genes. we tested for overrepresentation of gene ontology  terms against the genomic background using the annotation information available  for each n. vitripennis gene associated with a conserved region.  <dig> terms were significantly overrepresented with a q-value below  <dig> . the most overrepresented term in the set  was ‘regulation of gene expression’  which was associated with over a third  of the genes tested. in addition, many significant terms such as ‘nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity’  and ‘developmental process’  were returned, suggesting that genes associated with upstream conserved regions often themselves have regulatory and/or developmental roles. a set of  <dig> terms were overrepresented for the set of  <dig> pseudo-cnes , albeit with lower significance compared to the cne set. this suggests that the long highly at-rich sequences that are picked up in this control have a weak, but detectable association with gene expression and specific processes – an observation not further explored here.

the  <dig> most deeply conserved sequences  also appear to be associated with a specific class of genes.  <dig> of these cnes were found to lie completely within transcribed regions , and all  <dig> were found to overlap transcribed regions by at least a third of the length of the cne. this enrichment is significant  when compared to the full set of  <dig>  of which only ~70 % overlap transcribed regions by this amount. remarkably for such a small set of genes, a go term overrepresentation test turned up  <dig> significant terms. the  <dig> genes associated with these  <dig> cnes are enriched for genes active in processes such as post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression , regulation of translation , and translational elongation . this list of overrepresented go terms is, unlike that obtained from the full set of  <dig> cnes, devoid of terms relating to transcriptional regulation, matching the shift towards putative translational regulatory cnes.

5’ utr cnes contain conserved secondary structures
among the cnes that we identified were previously-studied regulatory elements, as well as many unidentified novel putative regulatory elements. as the majority of cnes overlap 5’ utrs, we calculated the likelihood of there being a conserved secondary structure in each cne. this analysis revealed several conserved secondary structures, including an example of the well-characterized iron response element  in the 5’ utr of the ferritin gene , a conserved hairpin loop bound by iron response proteins  to help maintain iron homeostasis. we also identified novel conserved rna structures, including a conserved, strong  hairpin loop found in the 5’ utr of the paramyosin gene  identified in all four hymenoptera species, and a hairpin loop with perfect stem complementarity but variable apical sequence conserved in the 5’ utr of the not <dig> gene . these three hairpins differ in their fundamental characteristics. ires are characterized by a highly conserved apical sequence  with a more variable stem sequence  <cit> . in contrast, the 4-nucleotide apical sequence  of not <dig> appears to be highly variable, whereas the stem sequence is almost perfectly conserved. more sequences are necessary to be able to reliably characterize the paramyosin hairpin, although there does appear to be at least one variable nucleotide in the hairpin apex. the positions of the hairpins also appear to be of functional importance; all three hairpins are conserved in their position relative to the translation start site, particularly the not <dig> hairpin .fig.  <dig> a highly conserved hairpin loop in the 5’ utr of not <dig>  a upstream cne-containing not <dig> sequences. three footprints of conservation are clearly visible; the first two  constitute the stem sequence of the hairpin and are shown as motif  <dig>  the third footprint  is the conserved sequence adjacent to the translation start site and contains an atg upstream of the translation start site. hairpin loop stabilities are shown in red and outliers  are marked with blue asterisks. acyrthosiphon pisumi represents a putative not <dig> paralog. b n. vitripennis not <dig> cne predicted rna folded structure colored by sequence conservation, showing highly variable apical sequence and conserved stem



the not <dig> hairpin loop has a stem sequence of 12 bp, and the cne containing it is found directly adjacent to the translation start site. the cne contains two conserved stem sequences with near-perfect complementarity, a weakly conserved apical sequence, and a highly conserved, upstream atg-containing motif directly adjacent to the translation start site. in n. vitripennis, this cne is present in the 5’ utr of all four known transcripts. as the position of this cne is so strongly conserved, we scanned the first 100 bp of every orthologous transcript in all ensembl metazoa species for presence of either the conserved hairpin or for the conserved sequence adjacent to the translation start site. the results of this search  indicated that in all cases where the hairpin loop is present the conserved sequence adjacent to the translation start site is present too, but not vice-versa . the presence of the sequence in the antarctic krill euphasia superba  and in a centipede  shows that this cne was an early arthropod adaptation.

an uncharacterized gene cluster contains several cnes
we identified conserved putative regulatory sequences in six separate genes of the insect-specific osiris gene cluster . our analysis indicates that these regions are hymenoptera-specific, and are generally conserved in position relative to their associated gene. since the conserved regions are associated with a specific class of genes with core functions, the fact that conserved promoter regions were identified near to six genes in the same cluster is perhaps indicative of an important developmental or regulatory role for this as-yet uncharacterized gene cluster.

ribosomal stalk gene cnes date back to early animals
two conserved sequences were identified in the 5’ utrs of the two ribosomal stalk heterodimer genes, rplp <dig> and rplp <dig>  given that parts of these sequences were found to be perfectly conserved over several nucleotides, we looked for presence of the same sequences in more distant phyla. a motif elicitation analysis  revealed three separate sequence motifs in the rplp <dig> cne, and three in the rplp <dig> cne. these motifs are present in many different phyla , including both deuterostomes and protostomes, making these the third and fourth known examples of bilaterian conserved regulatory elements   <cit> . these two conserved sequences were both early innovations in animalia. the rplp <dig> cne was found in the genomes of the placozoan trichoplax adhaerens and the cnidarian nematostella vectensis . n. vectensis also contains the rplp <dig> cne, as do the ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi  and the poriferan amphimedon queenslandica . both cnes were present in the majority of species that we analyzed . previously, the most ancient cnes identified were found conserved between deuterostomia and cnidaria  <cit> , thus dating back over  <dig> million years  <cit> . the cne on rplp <dig> that we report here appears to have originated even earlier, being found in the porifera. this cne is thus likely over  <dig> million years old  <cit> . the cne on rplp <dig> may also be older than  <dig> million years, depending on how the deep splits in the phylogeny of animals are eventually resolved  <cit> .fig.  <dig> distribution of most ancient cnes across phyla. cladogram showing presence , absence , or mixed presence-absence  of the deeply conserved rplp <dig> and rplp <dig> cnes. numbers in brackets show number of species analyzed per group for the rplp1/rplp <dig> cnes respectively. groups are outlined by color: blue , orange , green , pink 



the conserved regions paint an interesting evolutionary story. firstly, in the rplp <dig> cne , there are three distinct conserved sequences. the first conserved sequence appears to have two distinct forms; one found in protostomes  and another in deuterostomes , which appears to be the ancestral form as it is found in cnidaria and placozoa. the second and third motifs are found well conserved across both deuterostomes and protostomes, and are variably spaced; for example all mammalian species analyzed share a similar insertion between these two motifs. the relative position of the cne is found conserved across all phyla , remaining within 150 bp of the translation start site.fig.  <dig> evolution of rplp <dig> cne over at least  <dig> million years. a alignment of rplp <dig> cne in all organisms where detected. sequence logo diagrams of each conserved motif are shown below the alignment. motif 1a is protostome-specific whereas motif 1b appears to be the ancestral and deuterostome form. motifs  <dig> and  <dig> are variably spaced and are present in all phyla examined. species name color scheme matches that of fig.  <dig>  b diagram showing the position and spacing of each motif in each organism in relation to the translation start site. genus/species abbreviations are defined in additional file 2: table s10



the rplp <dig> cne  also appears to be described best as three distinct motifs. motif  <dig> is exceptionally well conserved, with no variation at all across 10 bp. motif  <dig> comprises a conserved region, generally followed by a short stretch of adenine nucleotides. motif  <dig> is short and does not appear to be present in either d. melanogaster or mnemiopsis leidyi. these observations make clear that these cnes are functionally complex, being comprised of several discrete elements punctuated by less evolutionarily constrained sequence. this is in contrast to other kinds of conservation such as ultraconserved regions, where long stretches of nucleotides  are found perfectly conserved between human, rat, and mouse, <cit>  which can be in some cases deleted without a clear critical loss of function  <cit> . as a whole, the complexity, shared associated gene function, and age of these cnes marks them as interesting targets for future study.fig.  <dig> evolution of rplp <dig> cne over at least  <dig> million years. a alignment of rplp <dig> cne in all organisms where detected. the three distinct sequence motifs are shown aligned below the main alignment. species name color scheme matches that of figure  <dig>  b diagram showing the position and spacing of each motif in each organism in relation to the translation start site. genus/species abbreviations are defined in additional file 2: table s10



discussion
in this paper, we used a high stringency statistical approach to identify and characterize  <dig> ancient non-coding elements  which have remained conserved over large evolutionary distances. the bulk of the conserved sequences that we identified are specific to hymenoptera, but nevertheless have been conserved in place for at least  <dig> million years of insect evolution . a small proportion of the cnes  that we identified were at least  <dig> million years old, with three stretching back further still. two cnes are found conserved in a range of the most basal animal clades across a wide variety of both vertebrates and invertebrates and are likely over  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> million years old  <cit> , likely the oldest cnes described to date.

these two ancient cnes are located in the 5’ utrs of two genes that are known to interact with one another; rplp <dig> and rplp <dig>  the two protein products of these ubiquitously expressed genes, p <dig> and p <dig>  form a heterodimer; two copies of which bind to the 60s acidic ribosomal protein p <dig>  to form the ribosomal stalk. the ribosomal stalk is involved in translational fine tuning and is crucial for the correct folding of many proteins  <cit> . the depth and breadth of conservation of these sequences is indicative of a fundamental regulatory role. indeed, the 5’ utr of rplp <dig> has already been shown to have a regulatory role in drosophila  <cit> , being sufficient to confer full translational control unto rplp <dig> as a non-translated gene in the early embryo, but not previously known to be conserved among animals. the fact that this cne has been previously studied and identified as a regulatory element helps to validate the idea that other cnes that we have identified are also functional regulatory elements. in drosophila, the cne we identified essentially spans the entirety of the rplp <dig> 5’ utr, whereas in other organisms it is only a constituent part. in this study, we have characterized the motifs likely to be important for the function of this regulatory element and examined their evolution over time.

most of the conserved regions identified in our analysis were found to be located within gene bodies as opposed to intergenic space, providing potential insights into a poorly understood class of regulatory elements. our analysis revealed conserved secondary structures in the 5’ utrs of several genes, examples including hairpin loops upstream of the ferritin gene , the paramyosin gene, and the vital  <cit>  regulatory  <cit>  gene not <dig>  secondary rna structures such as hairpins can have important regulatory consequences, having the capacity to both enhance and inhibit translation. the effect of a hairpin on translation differs depending on the stability of the hairpin, its distance from the mrna cap, and gc content  <cit> . these three hairpins have different fundamental characteristics, and thus likely perform their putative regulatory functions in different ways. the strong , and gc-rich  paramyosin hairpin is likely able to present a significant barrier to translation at any distance from the cap, whereas the potential function of the weaker  not <dig> hairpin is less obvious. the not <dig> hairpin exhibits a complex conservation pattern, with near-perfect stem complementarity, tight positional conservation, and an associated conserved upstream aug , itself a tightly-suppressed  <cit>  class of regulatory element.

the cnes that we identified, confirming similar observations in other organisms  <cit> , are associated with regulatory and developmental genes. this observation is consistent with the idea of regulatory gene cascades, that genes involved in regulation are themselves tightly regulated, allowing master regulators to exert overall control of gene regulation ‘programs’ to reprogram cells  <cit> . this result is augmented by the more specific observation that the deeply conserved set of  <dig> cnes , which are likely to be post-transcriptional regulatory elements, are associated with genes themselves involved in post-transcriptional regulation.

we also identified fundamental differences in basic sequence properties of the cnes when compared with control sequences. gc content in cnes is generally elevated ; sharply peaking on the cne itself but also raised in the flanking regions. this result is informative as gc content is known to be important for regulation; it is associated with regulatory mechanisms such as nucleosome occupancy  <cit> , aspects of secondary structure stability and effects on translation, and for example in chicken, variance in gc content in the 5’ utr of genes can perhaps explain 10 % of the variation in expression level  <cit> .

one important feature of many of the cnes that we discovered is that their positions relative to the translation start site are conserved, i.e. that the position of the cne is conserved as well as its sequence . when more reliable transcription start site data are available, it will be possible to examine whether putative transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that we identified are conserved relative to the transcription start site, or whether some of the translational regulatory mechanisms that we identified are more closely associated with the mrna cap position than the translation start site. this positional information could be useful in detecting cnes over large evolutionary distances, under the assumption that evolution sometimes proceeds by modifying the sequences of existing cis-regulatory cnes without significantly changing their relative position  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
overall, we have identified a large number of conserved sequence elements that, due to the strict false discovery controls that we have applied, and to previous experimental validation of a subset of these regions, are likely to be functionally important. it is our hope that each and every one of these regions will make interesting candidates for experimental analysis, helping to increase our understanding of regulation of gene expression, and particularly our understanding of regulatory elements in rna.
