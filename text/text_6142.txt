BACKGROUND
the field of in-silico promoter prediction has developed greatly in recent years. machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines and self-organising maps, and new features, especially those associated with structural properties of the dna molecule, have led to progressive improvements in accuracy. the realization that the majority of the genome is transcribed  <cit> , and that most promoters have diffuse clusters of multiple transcription start sites   <cit> , has led to a move away from discrete predictions, and towards scores for all base pairs of the genome. there is greater consensus on the correct way to evaluate predictions, reducing the biases inherent in the plethora of methods previously used  <cit> .

despite these developments, there is considerable need for improvement in promoter prediction performance. a bimodal distribution of cpg content splits human promoters into high and low-cpg content promoters  <cit> . promoters with lower cpg content are associated with tissue-specific regulation  <cit> , and are considered more difficult to predict  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows histograms of scores for arts  <cit>  and profisi  <cit> , two state-of-the-art methods. many valid promoters receive low scores, and setting thresholds low enough to recover them will inevitably return many false positives.

one obvious way of improving performance is to combine several existing methods using an ensemble learning approach. ensembles combining results from multiple programs have seen some use in promoter prediction  <cit> . they have also been successfully used in several other computational biology problem areas  <cit> . high diversity in individual methods is considered predictive of good ensemble accuracy  <cit> . it can be difficult, however, to improve on the performance of the best individual method  <cit> . in this paper, our aim was to explore whether the set of prediction methods was indeed diverse, and to improve predictive performance across the genome and at all thresholds.

all except methylation and conservation are outputs from prediction programs. arts scores were split into + and - strands. methylation scores were split into stem cell and differentiated categories.

as not all of our features are prediction scores, we did not use an averaging or voting-based ensemble method. instead we used a support vector machine for aggregation. this also gave us the opportunity to use a non-linear kernel to increase separability of promoter and non-promoter classes.

metaprom  <cit>  and ensempro  <cit>  are both programs that use ensemble methods for promoter prediction. although we were unable to obtain predictions for these programs, we could evaluate profisi ensemble using the evaluation rules described in the original papers in an attempt to make some comparison with them. metaprom is based on an artificial neural network, and makes predictions in an area covering around 30% of the human genome, using a combination of dbtss and refseq as the reference set. multiple methods are discussed in the ensempro paper, but the most successful is weighted majority voting. it restricts its predictions to an area  <dig>  base pairs either side of  <dig> tss drawn from the eukaryotic promoter database . the epd is known to be strongly biased towards tata box-containing promoters, which only comprise a small fraction of human promoters as a whole  <cit> .

RESULTS
where more than one prediction existed in a  <dig>  bp range, only the prediction with the highest score was counted. for prosom, ep <dig>  arts, and profisi, predictions were thresholded to leave ~ <dig>  predictions per program.

principal components analysis  of the training set  was used to give a rough visual representation of the separability of the promoter and non-promoter classes. the first two principal components are plotted in figure 2a. no one feature was noticeably highly weighted in the first two principal components. non-promoters form a reasonably tight cluster, while promoters are much more diffuse. this is a consequence of using promoter-centric features. naively, it would be expected that the non-promoter class would be more diffuse, given the many different types of dna it comprises. the feature weights from these principal components are plotted in figure 2b. promoter features appear together, in two groups, while conservation and methylation features are both separate.

evaluating the contribution of each feature in a support vector machine can be difficult and computationally expensive. we therefore used information gain-based feature ranking to predict the potential contribution of each feature. the predicted ranking is shown in table  <dig>  arts  <cit>  was ranked top, which was not surprising given its status as best performer in the last comprehensive prediction review  <cit> . surprisingly, the ranking of methylation scores was comparable to many supervised methods. this may be because we only had nonzero scores for cpg islands, areas associated with promoter activity in general. conservation was the lowest ranked feature by some distance. this implies that it is only beneficial when combined with other features.

the top  <dig> features in this ranking were used to train the 'high specificity' svm.

we trained svms using both the full set of  <dig> features, and a reduced set of the  <dig> top features ranked by information gain. both were tested on human chromosome  <dig> only using pppbenchmark  <dig>   <cit> . the mapped area of chromosome  <dig> corresponds to ~1% of the genome. sensitivity-specificity curves for these tests are shown in figure  <dig>  the reduced feature set is more accurate at high thresholds, while the full set is more accurate at low thresholds. this held true even when we tried a large range of different parameters for both c  and Î³ . it was decided to combine results from both models for the whole genome test. we used the reduced model unless its predicted probability fell below  <dig> , in which case the full model was used instead. this idea of "punting" - switching classifiers when the score falls below a certain threshold - has been successfully used in protein family prediction  <cit> . to verify the soundness of the idea, we reran pppbenchmark with the combined predictions. the area under the resulting curve was the same as the area under the union of the two previous results. having learned our threshold on 1% of the data, we then calculated predictions for the whole genome.

an example of one of the final predictions is given in figure  <dig>  shown is the area  <dig> kbp around the vps <dig> promoter, a promoter not associated with a cpg island. plots of features with nonzero values in this area, as well as gc content, are shown beneath the main prediction. the peak in the profisi ensemble score coincides well with both the refseq and cage annotations. in addition, scores either side of the peak are very low, indicating the reduction in noise achieved by the ensemble approach, compared to individual predictors.

whole genome predictions were evaluated using pppbenchmark  <dig> . pppbenchmark evaluates predictions versus cap analysis of gene expression  and refseq annotations, using both binning and distance-based protocols, for an accurate overall view of predictive power. the best performer in the original benchmarking was arts.

profisi ensemble's pppbenchmark performance was as follows: 1a:  <dig>  1b:  <dig>  2a:  <dig>  2b:  <dig> . this is an improvement over arts in all categories. the ppp score is defined as the harmonic mean of the four scores given above. profisi ensemble's ppp score was  <dig> , or 14% better than arts. figure  <dig> shows these 2a and ppp scores. in summary, profisi ensemble is currently the most accurate predictor of human promoter activity.

we also performed comparisons with metaprom and ensempro. as we did not have access to predictions from these programs, we evaluated profisi ensemble using their evaluation rules.

metaprom uses a combination of dbtss and refseq as its evaluation set, taking not only a single representative tss from dbtss, but also the most upstream and downstream, to evaluate performance in the prediction of alternative tss. predictions within  <dig> kbp of the tss were considered valid. the results of our evaluation are shown in figure 7a. metaprom performed better at high specificities, while profisi ensemble performed better at high sensitivities.

ensempro uses the epd as its reference set. as mentioned above, the epd is not considered a representative set of human promoters. only an area  <dig>  kbp in size around the tss was examined. predictions within  <dig> bp  or  <dig> bp  were counted as true positives. the results of the evaluation are shown in figure 7b. profisi ensemble shows roughly equivalent performance to ensempro in this evaluation, although results may not be exact due to variations in the dataset .

CONCLUSIONS
profisi ensemble uses a two layer approach to prediction. two svms are trained using scores from existing prediction programs as features. the predictions from these svms are then combined in an either/or manner.

in this work, we have demonstrated the substantial heterogeneity of promoter predictions from current methods. we showed that this heterogeneity enables performance improvements via an ensemble approach. finally, we have shown that high-sensitivity and high-specificity classifiers may be combined using a "punting" approach to guarantee higher performance across a range of thresholds.

in many fields, diverse predictors for the same task exist, often of broadly similar performance. if these predictors are sufficiently heterogenous, there is merit in exploring an ensemble-based approach. if high specificity/precision is required, consideration should be given to using feature ranking to ensure that only useful features are included.

the same technique we have used for human predictions could be extended to any other genome, as long as sufficiently diverse predictions are available for it. detailed instructions on applying our method to other organisms are included in additional file  <dig>  many prediction programs are able to output predictions for multiple genomes. ep <dig>  for example contains models for ten model organisms  <cit> . as we have used a supervised approach, a high quality training set  is essential, however.
