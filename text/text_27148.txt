BACKGROUND
micro rnas , which are typically 20– <dig> nucleotides  in length, are derived from primary mirna transcripts  that contain a stem-loop secondary structure. the pri-mirna is processed in the nucleus by dcl <dig>  a dicer-like protein, to create a mirna-mirna* duplex, where mirna* is a passenger strand complementary to the mirna. the duplex is then separated by helicase and the mature mirna is incorporated into an argonaute  <dig>  protein to form an rna-induced silencing complex   <cit> . target genes that contain a sequence with almost complete complementary to the mirna are cleaved by the risc at a specific site opposite to the 10th or 11th nucleotide in the mirna. the mirna* species is thought to be degraded  <cit> . however, recent research demonstrated that ago-associated mirna393* guides the silencing of a golgi-localized snare gene, indicating that mirna* species may be capable of functioning as mirnas  <cit> .

typically, mirna-guided cleavage represses target gene expression; however, a group of 22 nt mirnas also trigger secondary sirna biogenesis in plants  <cit> . some 22 nt mirnas are generated from bulged duplexes comprising a 22 nt mirna and a 21 nt mirna*; these duplexes are processed by dcl <dig>  by contrast, dcl <dig> generates 22 nt mirnas by processing perfect duplexes comprising a 22 nt mirna and a 22 nt mirna*. the latter type of 22 nt mirna may trigger secondary sirna biogenesis. during this process, the mirna is incorporated into ago <dig> which guides 5’ cleavage of the target, and then rna-dependent rna polymerase  <dig>  synthesizes a double-stranded rna fragment that is subsequently cut into secondary sirnas. with the exception of the 24 nt secondary sirnas , most secondary sirnas are 21 nt in length  <cit> . the mechanism of biogenesis of trans-acting sirnas  generated from tas <dig> differs from that described above. a complex comprising mir <dig> and ago <dig> binds to tas <dig> at two sites and guides the cleavage of the tasirna precursor. the cleavage product is then converted to double-stranded rna by rdr <dig> and dcl <dig>  and tasirnas are generated one by one from the cleavage site to the 5’ side. all of the secondary sirnas described above may incorporate into agos and function similarly as mirnas  <cit> .

traditional cloning and sequencing methods have been used to identify mirnas in model plants, including arabidopsis, rice and poplar. comparison of the sequences of mirnas from these species has revealed that most are highly conserved  <cit> . nevertheless, a number of non-conserved mirnas may be family-specific or species-specific. generally, non-conserved mirnas are expressed at a lower level than conserved mirnas. recently, high-throughput sequencing has been used for the identification and expression profiling of mirnas in many horticultural plants, including tomato, grape, papaya, radish and trifoliate orange . accurate identification of mirnas from large amounts of sequencing data is challenging; therefore, minimal criteria for annotation of mirnas in plants were consolidated  <cit> . a mirna-mediated degraded fragments sequencing  approach was also reported to be capable of efficient characterization of mirna target genes  <cit> . this method involves ligation of the 3’ fragment generated by risc, which contains a 5’-monophosphate, to a 5’ race adaptor. reverse transcription is then performed using oligo as a 3’ adaptor and the cdnas formed by second strand synthesis are digested with mmei to generate 20 bp signatures that are sequenced and used to identify mirna target pairs .

as described above, mirnas act as regulators of plant development  <cit> ; mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  in particular, play important roles in regulating leaf development . additionally, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> are involved in flowering regulation and phase changing from vegetative growth to reproductive growth . overexpression of osmir <dig> leads to increasing rice size and promoting panicle branching  <cit> . the understanding of the roles of mirna in the regulation of reproductive growth is further improved by recent research on non-conserved  mirnas; for example, mir <dig> in the solanaceae regulates a ca2+-atpase involved in tomato reproductive growth  <cit> .

the first report of mirnas in the rutaceae family was in poncirus trifoliata
 <cit>  and high-throughput sequencing was recently used to identify mirnas and their targets in this species  <cit> . our group previously identified mirnas in sweet orange  by using est assembly as reference to dig out mirna seqeunces  <cit> . here, based on our recently published sweet orange genome  <cit> , we performed a genome-wide characterization of srnas  and their targets  in the leaves, flowers and fruits of sweet orange . a total of  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified; the tissue specifically expressed mirnas were validated with the aim of identifying mirnas involved in the regulation of fruit development and maturation.

RESULTS
sequencing of srnas and the degradome
the illumina sequencing data of srnas from leaf, flower and fruit showed that 24 nt srnas are the most abundant and very few longer srnas . the greater abundance of 24 nt srnas rather than 21 nt srnas in all three tissues agrees with the results observed for other dicots  <cit> . after discarding low quality reads and sequence counts lower than  <dig> in each library, clean reads were produced. the clean reads were then compared with the sequence of the c. sinensis genome  <cit> . overall, perfect matches with the c. sinensis genome were obtained for  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of unique srnas from leaf, flower and fruit, respectively . the srna tags were annotated with sequences from the rfam database to eliminate non-coding rnas, including rrna, trna, snrna and snorna. a search of the mirbase database  identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> unique matches for the srnas identified in leaf, flower and fruit, respectively . a blast search of mirbase identified  <dig> known mirnas based on sequence similarity and the presence of a stem-loop structure in the precursor. the srna clean reads that were not known mirnas were mapped to the genome and were used to predict novel mirnas according to the structure and expression criteria  <cit> . finally,  <dig> candidate novel mirnas with a clear precursor containing a stem-loop secondary structure were identified .figure  <dig>

to identify the target genes of mirnas, a high-throughput experimental approach was used to sequence the degradome libraries of the leaf, flower and fruit tissues. after discarding low quality sequences, more than  <dig> million clean reads were obtained for each tissue. the cdna sequences annotated from orange genome platform  <cit>  was used as the mrna reference dataset and the combination of  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas was used as the mirna reference dataset. overall, perfect matches with the mrna reference dataset were obtained for  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of unique tags from the leaf, flower and fruit samples, respectively . in addition,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> degraded mrna fragments of mirna targets were identified in leaf, flower and fruit, respectively. the mirna reference dataset and the degraded fragments were then used to generate mirna-mrna pairs. a total of  <dig> targets were identified for  <dig> mirnas which expressed in leaf. in addition,  <dig> targets were identified for  <dig> mirnas in flower and  <dig> targets were identified for  <dig> mirnas in fruit . confidence evaluation of degradome data was performed as reported previously  <cit> . the target transcripts were divided into three classes . in category i, the mirna-guided cleavage fragment was the most abundant tag matching the transcript; therefore, category i is most reliable for the detection of mirna-targeted genes. in category ii, the mirna-guided cleavage fragment was not the most abundant fragment; however, it still formed a clear peak in the t-plot. the remaining target transcripts were classified into category iii .table  <dig>

known mirnas and their targets in the leaf, flower and fruit tissues
a total of  <dig> known mirnas, including  <dig> isoforms with high expression level, belonging to  <dig> families, were identified. the sweet orange genome sequence was used to predict rna secondary structures; all of the precursors of the  <dig> known mirnas had regular stem-loop secondary structures .

comparison of the normalized expression levels of mirnas in the leaf, flower and fruit tissues revealed that  <dig> known mirnas displayed higher expression  in leaf than those in flower or fruit;  <dig> known mirnas showed higher expression in flower; and  <dig> known mirnas displayed higher expression in fruit . for example, csi-mir477a-3p, csi-mir <dig>  and csi-mir168a showed much higher expression levels  in fruit. in addition, some mirnas, including csi-mir166j. <dig>  csi-mir166j. <dig>  csi-mir <dig> , csi-mir391b, csi-mir1432a, the csi-mir <dig> family and the csi-mir <dig> family, were expressed in leaf and flower but were not detected in fruit.figure  <dig> 
heat map of the normalized expression level  of all mirnas. mirnas belong to group  <dig> are highly expressed in leaf; mirnas belong to group  <dig> are highly expressed in flower; mirnas belong to group  <dig> are highly expressed in fruit. the colorbar is shown at the bottom of the figure.



the targets of known and conserved mirna families were identified from the degradome data. the target genes were divided into three categories as described above. a total of  <dig> targets of  <dig> known mirnas were identified in leaf degradome data; of these targets,  <dig> were classified into category i,  <dig> into category ii, and  <dig>  into category iii. in flower,  <dig> targets of  <dig> known mirnas were identified;  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were classified into categories i, ii and iii, respectively. in fruit,  <dig> targets of  <dig> known mirnas were identified; of these targets,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were grouped into categories i, ii and iii, respectively .most of the conserved mirnas have similar targets to arabidopsis thaliana
 <cit> . multiple targets were also observed for these mirnas. for example, the mir <dig> family controls feedback regulation of ago  <dig> as previously reported  <cit> .

the mirnas and their targeted transcripts from leaf, flower and fruit tissues indicated that a single mirna may target genes in a tissue-specific manner. in most circumstance, conserved known mirnas had the same or homologous targets as other plant species, and most of them were grouped into category i. however, a minority of the conserved mirnas had different targets in specific tissues. an interesting example was csi-mir168a; the finding that this mirna targeted ago <dig> as a feedback regulator in all three tissues is consistent with previous reports  <cit> . additionally, csi-mir168a was found to specifically target a cup-shaped cotyledon  <dig>  gene in leaves and a pantothenate kinase gene in fruit, as highly supported by the degradome data from different tissues . therefore, csi-mir168a is not only involved in stabilizing the accumulation of ago <dig>  but also has additional roles in the leaf and fruit biology. another example is that csi-mir <dig> family was detected to target the transcription factor gamyb in leaf and flower in consistency with previous reports  <cit> . however, in fruit, degraded fragments of gamyb generated by csi-mir <dig> were absent and this mirna was found to targete cs8g <dig> which was annotated as the lrr-containing protein drt <dig> with potential roles in dna damage repair . a previous study in rice also demonstrated that members from the same mirna family can have different expression patterns, and this expression difference affects the selectiveness of target gene  <cit> . these observations indicated that conserved mirnas may fulfill additional regulatory roles in specific tissue in addition to the conserved and general functions across plant species.

novel mirnas and their targets in the leaf, flower and fruit tissues
a total of  <dig> candidate novel mirnas with a clear precursor containing a stem-loop secondary structure were identified . the complementary mirna* sequences for each candidate novel mirnas were also detected, although most were present at a lower level than their corresponding mirnas. unfortunately, we were unable to determine if biogenesis of these candidate novel mirnas is dependent on dcl <dig> because of the lack of availability of a c. sinensis dcl <dig> mutant strain.

more than half of the novel mirnas identified was expressed at high levels .  <dig> novel mirnas showed higher expression in leaf than flower or fruit;  <dig> novel mirnas showed higher expression in flower than leaf or fruit; and  <dig> novel mirnas displayed higher expression in fruit than leaf or flower. for example, csi-mirn <dig> and csi-mirn <dig> showed higher expression in fruit than leaf or flower .

from the degradome data,  <dig> targets of seven novel mirnas were identified in leaf; of these targets,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were classified into categories i, ii and iii, respectively. a total of  <dig> targets of  <dig> novel mirnas in flower were identified; three of these targets were classified into category i, two were grouped into category ii, and the remaining  <dig> were classified into category iii. in fruit,  <dig> targets of  <dig> mirnas were identified, of which four were classified into category i, three were grouped into category ii, and  <dig> were classified into category iii . in summary, nine target genes of novel mirnas were grouped into category i, some of which had multiple predicted functions. cs8g <dig>  which is annotated as an flowering-related  protein, was identified as a target of csi-mirn7; and cs1g <dig>  which is annotated as a light control  protein, was identified as a target of csi-mirn <dig>  some of the identified targets were not sufficiently annotated; for example, cs4g <dig> , targeted by csi-mirn <dig>  was annotated as a putative uncharacterized protein. .table  <dig> 
target genes grouped into category i of novel mirnas in orange


n/a means not available in the degradome data. target transcripts were divided into three classes. in category i, the mirna-guided cleavage fragment was the most abundant tag matching the transcript; in category ii, the mirna-guided cleavage fragment was not the most abundant fragment; however, it still formed a clear peak in the t-plot. the remaining target transcripts were classified into category iii.



of the novel mirnas that were considered to be younger  than the conserved mirnas, only three  had common targets or homologous genes in all tissues. most of the novel mirnas appeared to target different transcripts in different tissues; for example, csi-mirn <dig> targeted cs9g <dig> in flower and cs4g <dig> in fruit . these results suggested that the functions of novel mirnas may differ in leaf, flower and fruit tissues and might fulfill a more specific role when compared with known and conserved mirnas.

identification of secondary sirnas in c. sinensis
an in-house script was developed to predict secondary sirnas that might be triggered by 22 nt mirnas in citrus. after the prediction, we examined the abundances of the secondary sirnas using srna sequencing data. seven mirnas were predicted to trigger the secondary sirnas generation , four of them were identified in at least two tissues. csi-mirn <dig> could be identified in all three tissues; csi-mir482a-3p in both leaves and fruits, csi-mir3954a and csi-mir482c in both leaves and flowers. secondary sirnas were named using the convention of “mirna-target-serial number”; for example, csi-mir3954a-cs1g <dig> - <dig> refers to the ninth phased sirna generated from cs1g <dig>  and triggered by csi-mir3954a. moreover, we identified these secondary sirnas’ target genes using degradome sequencing data . most of the secondary sirna and target pairs had a high penalty score and only a few targets were classified into categories i and ii. the analysis indicated that csi-mir3954a-cs1g <dig> - <dig> targeted triose-phosphate transporter gene , csi-mir482a-3p-cs5g <dig> - <dig> targeted the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor  gene , and csi-mirn20-cs3g <dig> - <dig> targeted a signal peptidase gene . these findings suggest that these phased sirnas may play regulatory roles in plant development.

here, multiple lines of evidence suggest the existence of both conserved and orange-specific tas gene families. the homologous tas <dig> gene  was identified as a target of csi-mir <dig> in orange. this is consistent with previous studies from tas1- <dig> genes in arabidopsis
 <cit> , mdtas <dig> and mdtas <dig> in apple  <cit> and tas <dig> gene containing two mir <dig> binding sites in tobacco  <cit> . noticeably, a potential orange-specific tas gene targeted by cis-mir3954a was observed with multiple supports. firstly, csi-mir3954a was a citrus-specific mirna which showed abundant expression in all three tissues; secondly, this mirna was found to be 22 nt in length and was also found to contain a 5’u; this characteristic structure was believed to trigger phased sirna biogenesis <cit> ; thirdly, the target gene  of csi-mir3954a could not be functionally annotated and was predicted to be a non-coding transcript; fourthly, the secondary sirnas, derived from csi-mir <dig> target genes, were detected in the small rna libraries. one of these secondary sirnas, named csi-mir3954a-cs1g <dig> - <dig>  was abundant in leaf and flower and targeted cs4g <dig>  therefore, we hypothesized that targets of csi-mir3954a are potential novel tas target genes. a further evidence to determine if this is dependent on rna-dependent rna polymerase  is difficult in sweet orange due to the lack of rdr mutants. a recent example in tobacco observed that the 22 nt nta-mir <dig> targets the n gene and triggers the generation of nta-sirnai and nta-sirnaii which was dependent on rdr <dig> as well as nta-sir <dig> , and concluded that the target of nta-mir <dig> might be a novel tas gene  <cit> .

the distruibution of mirnas in the c. sinensisgenome
both novel and known mirnas were equally distributed in the citrus genome ; however, some members of conserved mirna families were located in the same region of a single chromosome. for example, csi-mir169c and csi-mir169i were located in the same region of chromosome  <dig> figure  <dig>

we analyzed all simple sequence repeat  loci in the orange genome and examined their co-localization with pre-mirnas. overall,  <dig> csi-pre-mirna were identified to co-localize with ssr region.  <dig> % of the co-localized ssrs were binucleotide or trinucleotide sequences and the most frequent repeat unit was ua, consistent with the notion that most trinucleotide ssrs contain the base u in plants  <cit> . the longest ssr, consisting of  <dig> , was located within the pre-mir396c sequence . notably, csi-mir396c had four precursors containing different sized trinucleotide ssrs.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were located within the pre-csi-mir396c- <dig>  pre-csi-mir396c- <dig> and pre-csi-mir396c- <dig> sequences, respectively. to date, little is known about the functions of ssrs co-localized with pre-mirnas. here, the length of the n repeat influenced the shape of the loop in the secondary structures of the csi-mir396c precursors . a previous report demonstrated that ssrs located in utrs and introns can affect gene expression and expression level  <cit> . interestingly, analysis of the maize zma-mir <dig> family showed that zma-mir396e and zma-mir396f bearing ssrs n and n had similar expression pattern among different tissues which was distinctly different from the expression pattern of the other mir <dig> members without ssrs . changes in the organization of the loop may directly influence the expression of mature mirna and may cause unexpected changes in their evolution.table  <dig>

isoforms of mirnas that originated from a long pre-mirna  were also identified. csi-mir166j. <dig> and csi-mir166j. <dig> were derived from the same precursor and were positioned 195 nt apart. similarly, csi-mir477d. <dig> andcsi-mir477d. <dig> were positioned 126 nt apart in the same precursor. however, the expression modes of the mature mirnas originating from these two precursors were distinctly different. csi-mir166j. <dig> and csi-mir166j. <dig> had extremely similar patterns of expression in different tissues and both the mature mirnas were derived from 3’ strand of the mirna-mirna* duplexes . in contrast, csi-mir477d. <dig> and csi-mir477d. <dig> were produced from different strands of the duplexes, i.e., csi-mir477d.1-3p was produced from 3’ strand while csi-mir477d.2-5p was produced from 5’ strand of the duplexes . a study in grapevine showed that mirc <dig> and mirc <dig> are located 224 nt apart on chromosome  <dig>  but these two mirnas exhibit different expression patterns  <cit> .

characterization of highly expressed mirnas in fruit
candidate mirnas that showed remarkably differential expression levels in fruit as revealed by the sequencing data were further confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr  and rna gel blotting analyses. totally,  <dig> known- and  <dig> novel- mirnas were chose for qrt-pcr confirmation;  <dig> of them  are consistent with the sequencing data . the results showed that csi-mir <dig>  csi-mir <dig>  csi-mir477a-3p and csi-mirn <dig> have remarkably higher expression in fruits compared with other tissues. these results were verified by both qrt-pcr and rna gel blotting . two targets of csi-mir <dig> were identified in fruit; the first was annotated as a nac transcription factor gene which was confirmed by 5’ race  and the second was annotated as a thymidine diphospho-glucose 4-6-dehydratase gene. csi-mir <dig> also had two targets in fruit; the first was orange <dig>  t <dig> and the second was cs1g <dig> , which were annotated as polyubiquitin  <dig> and polyubiquitin  <dig>  respectively. these targets may be involved in protein degradation. cs6g <dig>  which was annotated as the developmental protein sepallata  <dig> , was identified as a target of csi-mir477a-3p . targets of csi-mirn <dig> were not detected by the degradome analysis. the target prediction revealed that csi-mirn <dig> targeted transmembrane emp <dig> domain-containing gene.figure  <dig> 
expression levels of selected known mirnas in leaf, flower and fruit. total rnas from mixed leaf, mixed flower and fruit in 170daf were extracted for rna gel blot analyses; reverse complement probes were used to detect the indicated mirnas. u <dig> rna or  <dig>  s rrna were used as loading controls. two different genotypes of orange were used. orange genotype  <dig> is a common sweet orange while genotype  <dig> is a red flesh orange.  mir482d-5p. <dig> was specifically expressed in leaf.  mir3954a and mir167b. <dig> were expressed at higher levels in flower than the other tissues; mir <dig> was specifically expressed in flower  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were expressed at higher levels in fruit than the other tissues; mir477a-3p was specifically expressed in fruit. l <dig>  leaf of orange genotype 1; l <dig>  leaf of orange genotype 2; f <dig>  flower of orange genotype 1; f <dig>  flower of orange genotype 2; fr <dig>  fruit of orange genotype 1; fr <dig>  fruit of orange genotype  <dig> 



expression pattern of the four potential mirnas were then further investigated on eight stages of fruit development and ripening . the expression pattern suggested three of them are probably involved in the regulation of fruit development and ripening. both csi-mirn <dig> and csi-mir477a-3p may have important role in the color break stage . csi-mir <dig> showed significantly higher expression level at the final stage , with a steady increase in expression level during fruit ripening . in depth function of the former two mirnas are now under progress in other research. this study focused on csi-mir164a which may have particular function at the fruit ripening stages. at this stage, sweet orange is undergoing maturation with extensive molecular repertoire on both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. therefore, csi-mir <dig>  as a known mirna, may have new function in orange fruit ripening on posttranscriptional level.figure  <dig>

csi-mi <dig> functions via target a nac transcription factor
as mentioned above, csi-mir <dig> was highly active during fruit ripening and 5’race analysis showed csi-mir <dig> targeted cs5g <dig>  a nac transcription factor. to confirm the interaction between csi-mir <dig> and cs5g <dig> in orange fruit, we detected the expression level of cs5g <dig> by qrt-pcr at fruit developmental stages. as showed in figure 9a, the expression level of csi-mir <dig> and cs5g <dig> displayed complementary expression pattern. furthermore, a transient expression system was used to confirm that csi-mir <dig> degraded cs5g <dig> in vivo. overexpression vectors of csi-mir <dig> and a control mirna were constructed respectively. target site of mir <dig> in cs5g <dig> and a modified target site  were inserted into a green fluorescent protein  gene overexpression vector respectively as shown in figure 9b. in this assays, we used agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration to co-express csi-mir <dig>  control mirna, gfp gene carrying target site and gfp gene carrying modified target site pair by pair . as a result, csi-mir <dig> targeted the target region of cs5g <dig> and repressed the expression of gfp obviously .figure  <dig>

 expression levels of mi <dig> and cs5g <dig> were detected during the fruit development by qrt-pcr. u <dig> and actin were used as loading controls in qrt-pcr data from the qrt-pcr experiments are represented as the mean plus sd of n =  <dig> biological replicates.  four overexpression vectors were constructed for transient expression system in tobacco. vector ox-mir <dig> overexpress csi-mir <dig>  ox-mircon overexpress a control mirna, ox-10ts + gfp overexpress a gfp gene carrying target site of mir <dig> in cs5g <dig>  ox-10mts + gfp overexpress a gfp gene carrying a modified target site.  vectors used in tobacco co-expression assays in each lane were shown in the table.  co-infiltrated leaves and control leaves were photographed at the 3rd day after infiltration under bright light.  same leaves were photographed at the 3rd day after infiltration under uv light .



cs5g <dig> was categorized as a nac domain-containing transcription factor. plant nac transcription factor was one of the largest families involved in diverse biological processes . more, recent publications reveal that nac transcript factors function as regulators in fruit ripening. nacs in banana were supposed to be involved in banana fruit ripening by interaction with ethylene signaling components  <cit> . interestingly, the transcripts of manac <dig> decreased during banana ripening as well as cs5g <dig> decreased during orange ripening. so far in c. sinensis, two nacs were reported and suggested to be related to fruit development, fruit senescence and fruit response to postharvest stresses  <cit> . as csi-mir <dig> was higher expressed in fruit and was more active at the late stages during the orange fruit development, we suggested that csi-mir <dig> might be involved as a regulator in orange ripening by interacting with a nac transcription factor. further functional investigations of csi-mir <dig> and cs5g <dig> are required to confirm this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides a genome-wide comparison of mirnas and their target genes among leaf, flower and fruit of sweet orange with the aim of identification of regulators involved in fruit development and ripening. comprehensive genome analysis uncovered  <dig> known- and  <dig> novel- mirnas, and revealed their genomic characteristics such as isoform mirnas, co-localization with ssr locus and secondary sirnas. comparative analysis showed that some known mirnas, such as csi-mir168a and csi-mir <dig> in this study, may fulfill specific function in specific tissues via target different genes. this kind of tissue specific regulation was even obvious for novel mirnas. three mirnas, csi-mirn <dig>  csi-mir477a-3p and csi-164a, were identified to be highly expressed in fruit and probably important regulators of fruit ripening. csi-mir <dig> was further validated to functions by target nac transcription factor. the results of this study provide three promising mirnas for understanding the posttranscriptional regulation of orange fruit development and ripening.
