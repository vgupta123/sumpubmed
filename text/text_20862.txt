BACKGROUND
the rhizobia-legume mutualistic symbiosis is characterized by the formation of root nodules in which the bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen to generate nitrogen sources assimilable by the plant. although the attack of phytopathogens on plants have a different outcome , similar efficient strategies have been acquired by pathogenic and mutualistic bacteria to establish compatible associations with their host plants  <cit> . these include signals involved in cell-cell communication in bacterial populations but also in cross-kingdom communication with host plants  <cit> .

recently, swarming has been described in rhizobiaceae  <cit> . this type of co-ordinated movement was previously associated with the virulence of pathogens. in sinorhizobium meliloti, swarming motility was associated with the activity of a long-chain fatty acyl-coa ligase  which upon disruption affected nodulation efficiency on alfalfa roots. the authors hypothesized that a fatty acid derivative dependent on fadd activity may act as an intracellular signal controlling motility and symbiotic factors. in fact rpfb, a close homolog of fadd in xanthomonas campestris  <cit> , is implicated in the synthesis of cis-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid, a low-molecular-mass diffusible signal factor  involved in the regulation of pathogenicity factors  <cit> . in x. campestris the homolog of fadd is surrounded by genes which also participate in several ways in the regulation of important virulence determinants  <cit> . therefore, a closer look was taken at the genes of s. meliloti in the vicinity of the fadd locus to determine their participation in symbiosis and/or swarming. of the putative genes in the neighbourhood, the orf smc <dig> located upstream from fadd and transcribed divergently from this gene, shows significant identity to permeases of the major facilitator superfamily   <cit> . the mfs class of permeases is the second largest family of membrane transporters found, after the abc transporters. members of this protein superfamily are typically single-polypeptide secondary carriers, comprising of 10– <dig> transmembrane α-helices which are able to transport small solutes such as sugars or toxins in response to chemiosmotic ion gradients  <cit> . in this work, the role of smc <dig> in bacterial resistance to toxics, nod gene expression and nodulation of alfalfa is described.

RESULTS
s. meliloti orf smc <dig> potentially codes for a transmembrane transporter with striking homology to mfs permeases
to analyze the region surrounding the fadd gene of s. meliloti, the available sequence of s. meliloti  <dig>  <cit>  was used. the analysis using blast  <cit>  revealed an orf  downstream of fadd with homology to phosphoglucose isomerase  while upstream a divergently coding orf  showed high identity to permeases of the major facilitator superfamily . in this study, we characterize specifically orf smc <dig>  putatively, this orf encodes for a  <dig> amino acid protein with  <dig> transmembrane motifs typical of inner membrane proteins. this protein has an atp/gtp binding motif, an alanine rich region  and has the multi-domain of the mfs that covers most of the protein . the product shows the highest identity  with a putative mfs protein in beijerinckia indica subsp. indica atcc <dig>  and shares most identity to mfs related permeases, transmembrane proteins, sugar transporters and efflux proteins of bacteria belonging to the rhizobiales and burkholderiales orders. unfortunately, the physiological functions of the closest smc <dig> homologs have not been experimentally tested. one of the few smc <dig> homologs with an experimentally assigned function is cmlr , a chloramphenicol resistance protein of streptomyces lividans  <cit> .

the s. meliloti smc <dig> mutant shows higher sensitivity to chloramphenicol
to functionally characterize smc <dig>  we constructed the gr4t <dig> mutant in which the wild type locus was replaced with a mutated version. considering the homology shown by smc <dig> with cmlr, we compared the sensitivity of the gr4t <dig> mutant with the wild type s. meliloti strain gr <dig> to different concentrations of antimicrobial compounds such as chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and salicylic acid. the influence of luteolin and plant root exudates on the growth of these strains was also compared. only the presence of chloramphenicol reduced the growth of the mutant compared to that of the wild type strain . this suggests that the protein encoded by smc <dig> can function as an efflux pump, expelling the antibiotic chloramphenicol from the bacteria. as a result, we renamed orf smc <dig> to tep <dig> for transmembrane efflux protein. to rule out possible polar effects of the created mutation in tep <dig> on downstream genes, complementation of the chloramphenicol sensitivity of the mutant was attempted with a plasmid construct. however, the results were inconclusive due to severe growth problems. nevertheless, tep <dig> and the downstream gene of unknown function, smc <dig>  have different expression patterns  <cit>  and close homologs of these genes in other rhizobia are not located adjacently thereby suggesting that each form independent transcriptional units.

tep <dig> is not necessary for swarming motility in s. meliloti
to determine if the function of tep <dig> is related to swarming as is the fadd product encoded upstream, swarming assays were performed. the results in figure  <dig> show that the fadd mutant qs <dig> shows conditional swarming on semi-solid minimal medium  plates containing  <dig> % agar, in contrast to the wild type strain gr <dig>  likewise, the tep <dig> mutant gr4t <dig> does not show swarming. furthermore, the tep  <dig> knock out mutant in a fadd mutant background, qstr <dig>  shows swarming as the fadd simple mutant, qs <dig> . therefore, it appears that any substance possibly transported by tep <dig> is not involved in swarming motility.

a tep <dig> mutation in s. meliloti improves nodule formation efficiency on alfalfa plants but shows reduced nod gene expression
to determine whether the activity of tep <dig> is involved in symbiosis, the nodulation efficiency of the tep <dig> mutant was compared to the wild type strain. as shown in figure  <dig>  the mutant exhibits greater nodulation efficiency than the wild type strain during the first days of inoculation. moreover, competition experiments in which alfalfa plants were co-inoculated with mixtures 1: <dig> of the wild type and mutant strains revealed that the lack of tep <dig> confers a higher competitive ability to the bacterium . these results suggest that tep <dig> transports some type of compound which affects the nodulation of the host plant.

to check whether the greater nodule formation efficiency shown by the tep <dig> mutant correlates with an altered nod gene expression, activity of the nodc: lacz fusion  <cit>  was studied in the presence and absence of the inducer luteolin in either the mutant or wild type strain . in contrast to the constitutively expressed promoter of the npt gene   <cit> , the induction of the nodc::lacz transcriptional fusion in response to luteolin was reduced  <dig> fold in the tep <dig> mutant background compared to the s. meliloti wild type strain. this suggests that the product transported by tep <dig> influences the luteolin-induction of the nodc gene. it is unlikely that lower uptake and/or accumulation of the flavonoid by the tep <dig> mutant is responsible for the observed effect. it has been reported that in s. meliloti, luteolin mostly accumulates in the outer membrane and only a relatively small amount of the flavonoid is present in the cytoplasmic membrane, in or on which the interaction with the nodd protein takes place  <cit> . it has been proposed that the accumulation of the flavonoid in the outer membrane protects the bacteria against the inhibitory effect of luteolin on nadh oxidase activity. as previously mentioned, we tested the effect of different concentrations  of luteolin on the growth of the wild type and tep <dig> mutant strains. although in both strains growth was negatively affected with increasing concentrations of the flavonoid, no differences could be detected , suggesting that the mutation does not lead to different cellular concentrations of the inducer. another possible explanation for the reduction of nod gene expression in a tep <dig> mutant would be that the mutation results in the accumulation of a compound which inhibits or interferes with the activation of the nodc promoter.

β-galactosidase activity of the npt::lacz and nodc::lacz fusions were measured in the absence and presence of luteolin . mean values and standard errors  were calculated from three independent experiments.

a s. meliloti nodc mutant is affected in nod gene expression
the results described above suggest that tep <dig> transports a compound that has an effect on the number of nodules developed by the plant. the same or maybe a different compound transported by tep <dig> also affects the induction of the nodc gene in response to luteolin. it is known that the strong, constitutive expression of the nod genes results in reduced nodulation phenotypes on legumes  <cit> . in bradyrhizobium japonicum a feedback regulation of nod genes has been described  <cit> . the addition of chitin and lipochitin oligomers, or the expression of the β-glycosyl transferase nodc, reduces nod gene expression. these data together with the homology to sugar transporters shown by tep <dig>  prompted us to investigate whether the effects of the tep <dig> mutation could be due to alterations in the intra- and extracellular concentrations of nod factors or nod factor-related compounds. to our knowledge the existence or not of feedback regulation of nod genes in s. meliloti has not been investigated previously. consequently, the expression of the nodc promoter was tested in gr4c <dig>  a gr4-derivative nodc mutant, and compared with its activity in the tep <dig> mutant or in the wild type. the results  show that in contrast to b. japonicum in which nod gene expression is elevated in a nodc mutant   <cit> , nod gene expression is reduced  <dig>  fold in the s. meliloti nodc mutant strain, reaching levels very similar to those shown by the tep <dig> mutant strain. this result indicates that in s. meliloti i) there is no feedback regulation of nod genes, and ii) a compound or compounds whose intracellular concentration is affected by the lack of nodc activity, interferes with nod gene induction. one of the most probable consequences of the lack of nodc activity is the accumulation of precursors of the nod factor chitin backbone. to test whether changes in the concentration of these precursors could be responsible for the effects observed in the nodc and tep <dig> mutant, we decided to investigate how glucosamine and n-acetyl glucosamine influence both nod gene regulation in s. meliloti and nodulation of alfalfa plants.

β-galactosidase activity of the nodc::lacz fusion was measured after bacteria had been incubated with  <dig> μm luteolin. mean values and standard errors  were calculated from three independent experiments.

effect of glucosamine and n-acetyl glucosamine in nod gene expression in s. meliloti and on nodulation of alfalfa
to determine the possible role of core nod factor precursors in nod gene regulation, studies were performed with glucosamine or n-acetyl glucosamine. the addition of glucosamine does not affect nod gene expression significantly in s. meliloti gr <dig> even when up to  <dig> mm glucosamine was added . however, the addition of  <dig> mm n-acetly glucosamine reduces activity by more than 50% . at higher concentrations  of n-acetly glucosamine the level of nod gene activity remains unchanged from that observed with  <dig> mm. lower concentrations of the aminosugar , only led to a slight reduction in nodc gene expression . this indicates that in s. meliloti gr <dig>  n-acetyl glucosamine can reduce nod gene expression.

expression of a nodc::lacz fusion was measured in s. meliloti gr <dig> induced previously with  <dig> μm luteolin and different concentrations of n-acetyl glucosamine . mean values and standard errors  were calculated from three independent experiments.

to determine if core nod factor precursors also affect nodulation, the nodulation efficiency of alfalfa inoculated with s. meliloti gr <dig> was determined in the presence of different concentrations of glucosamine or n-acetyl glucosamine. the results in figure  <dig> show that at the lowest concentration  whereas glucosamine has no effect, n-acetyl glucosamine improves nodulation. it is known that n-acetyl glucosamines function as adhesins in some bacteria and that core nod factor plays a role in biofilm formation in s. meliloti, facts that could explain the positive effect of the aminosugar on nodulation  <cit> . surprisingly, the addition of  <dig> mm of glucosamine or n-acetyl glucosamine to the plant mineral solution, abolished or severely affected nodulation, respectively. as far as we know this is the first time that it has been shown that glucosamine or n-acetyl glucosamine inhibits nodulation by s. meliloti. the reason why these sugars at millimolar concentrations inhibit nodulation in alfalfa is not known but worth further investigation. we speculate that at high concentrations these compounds bind to and collapse plant lectins and/or nod factor receptors interfering with the recognition of symbiotic bacterial signals. on the other hand, it is noteworthy that the effects of high concentrations of these nod factor precursors on nod gene expression and nodulation are consistent with the effects observed in the tep <dig> mutant. therefore, as a first attempt to correlate the presence of these compounds with tep <dig> activity, we decided to investigate the effect of these aminosugars on tep <dig> transcription.

glucosamine and n-acetyl glucosamine activate tep <dig> transcription
synthesis of transporters is often induced by the presence of their cognate substrates  <cit> . the expression of the tep <dig> gene was tested in s. meliloti gr <dig> harbouring pmptr <dig>  grown in different conditions. the results shown in table  <dig> demonstrate that tep <dig> expression is higher in complex medium compared to defined minimal medium. interestingly, the addition of glucosamine and n-acetyl glucosamine to the minimal medium increased transcription of tep <dig>  suggesting that these aminosugars could be natural substrates of this putative transporter.

expression of a tep1::lacz fusion was measured in s. meliloti gr <dig> harbouring pmtr <dig> in ty medium, minimal medium , and mm supplemented with either  <dig> mm glucosamine  or  <dig> mm n-acetyl glucosamine . mean values and standard errors  were calculated from three independent experiments.

considering all the results described here, we propose the following working hypothesis which is illustrated in figure 5: tep <dig> participates in the efflux of small compounds such as chloramphenicol and aminosugars which are core nod factor precursors. although these compounds have different structures, secondary multidrug  transporters of the major facilitator superfamily are known to be promiscuous in substrate recognition and transport  <cit> . in the tep <dig> mutant, chloramphenicol and nod factor precursors accumulate inside the bacteria to concentrations which either hamper growth  or affect maximal nod gene expression . at the same time, the diminished efflux of aminosugars in the transport mutant leads to improved nodulation efficiency.

CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained in this work suggest that the tep <dig> gene encodes a transport protein belonging to the mfs family of permeases able to confer chloramphenicol resistance in s. meliloti by expelling the antibiotic outside the cell. a tep1-linked gene in s. meliloti, fadd, plays a role in swarming motility and in nodule formation efficiency on alfalfa plants. we have demonstrated that tep <dig> is not involved in swarming motility but like fadd affects the establishment of the s. meliloti-alfalfa symbiosis. a tep <dig> loss-of-function mutation leads to increased nodule formation efficiency but reduced nod gene expression suggesting that tep <dig> transports compounds which influence different steps of the nodule formation process. whether these effects are caused by the same or different compounds putatively transported by tep <dig>  still needs to be investigated. curiously, nod gene expression is reduced in a s. meliloti nodc mutant with the same intensity as in the tep <dig> mutant. this has implications for nod gene regulation in s. meliloti as it rules out the existence of a feedback regulation as described for b. japonicum. on the other hand, it could indicate that tep <dig> is involved in the transport of nod factors or its precursors. indeed, increased concentrations of the core nod factor precursor n-acetyl glucosamine reduced nod gene expression. moreover, both glucosamine and n-acetyl glucosamine inhibit nodulation at high concentrations. therefore, this constitutes the first work which attributes a role for core nod factor precursors as regulators for nodulation of the host plant by s. meliloti. furthermore, the results suggest that the activity of tep <dig> can modulate the nodule formation efficiency of the bacteria by controlling the transport of core nod factor precursors.
