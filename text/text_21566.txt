BACKGROUND
micrornas  are known to regulate the expression of target genes both at the level of mrna translation and mrna stability  <cit> . this ability to influence multiple genes makes mirnas well suited for the regulation of systems where the expression of large numbers of genes changes in concert. coordinated waves of mrna expression are well described during embryonic development  <cit>  including in brain development and synaptogenesis in vitro  <cit>  and thus many genes may therefore be targets for mirnas. consistent with this role, mirnas are differentially regulated in brain  <cit>  and mirna deficient vertebrates have severe abnormalities in brain development  <cit> . in mouse brain development, the period of neurogenesis between embryonic days 9- <dig> is followed by postmitotic neurons extending neurites and ultimately forming synapses and networks  <cit> . whole genome mrna profiling of primary cultures from e <dig>  embryos over three weeks shows simultaneous regulation of a set of genes encoding synaptic proteins  <cit> . the extent to which these synaptic genes are regulated by mirnas is unknown.

previous studies have demonstrated that mirna regulation is measurable at both the mrna and protein level of targeted genes  <cit> . at the same time, computational mirna target analysis has improved by combining mrna and mirna expression profiling  <cit> . we therefore sought to concomitantly profile mirna and mrna during synaptogenesis and use computational methods to examine the potential regulatory functions of mirnas.

RESULTS
mrna expression analysis
previous studies of neuronal network activity in mouse e <dig>  primary neuronal cultures established that spontaneous firing arises after three to six days and that during this phase there is a wave of synthesis of mrnas encoding synaptic proteins  <cit> . we therefore plated primary neuronal cultures from mouse forebrain of e <dig>  day embryos, extracted total rna   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  8) and profiled mrna levels on dna microarrays. array data was deposited in arrayexpress  <cit>  under accession e-tabm- <dig>  a total of  <dig>  microarray probes passed the differential expression significance threshold . their expression profiles were clustered using the markov cluster algorithm   <cit> , identifying  <dig> clusters. the two largest captured over 75% of the probes passing the differential expression threshold.

probes in these two clusters had, on average, opposite expression profiles, i.e. signals from the probes in one cluster were decreasing through the course of eight days, while the signal from the probes in the second cluster were increasing . probes in the two clusters were mapped to  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes respectively . in these two groups of genes we assessed enrichment of gene ontology   <cit>  terms  and enrichment of genes encoding the post synaptic proteome   <cit> .

signs of a defined developmental program emerged, which agreed with results from a previous hippocampal cultures study  <cit> . we found that go terms enriched in the cluster of down-regulated genes were related to nuclear localisation, dna biosynthesis, chromatin assembly, cell cycle, rna and protein biosynthesis, and regulation of various metabolic processes. on the other hand, go terms overrepresented in up-regulated genes were mostly involved in ion transport, secretion, synaptic transmission and atp biosynthesis, while enriched cellular component go terms were cytoplasmic, synaptic and membrane . up-regulated genes were also highly significantly enriched in postsynaptic proteome  genes .

mirna expression analysis
in order to reliably relate mrna and mirna expression, the same total rna samples were used for mirna profiling. array data was deposited in the arrayexpress  <cit>  under accession number e-tabm- <dig>  in this way  <dig> mirnas out of  <dig> mirnas profiled by microarray were defined as significantly differentially regulated with no magnitude of change cutoff  while  <dig> mirnas were up or down regulated more than  <dig>  fold .

all significantly differentially expressed mirnas were separated by mcl  <cit>  into nine expression clusters. the expression profiles of differentially expressed mirnas are similar to the profiles of mrna coding genes . two large clusters encompassed the majority  of clustered mirnas. under the loose definition of differential expression each of these two clusters contained approximately  <dig> mirnas, which was  <dig>  times more than any of the other clusters. as with mrna expression, the average profile of the two largest mirna expression clusters displayed opposite trends. we noted that up-regulated probes of both mrna and mirna mi-croarray probes intersect around day four . coincidently, this is the time electrical activity can first be detected in primary cultures  <cit> .

surprisingly, mirnas expressed at high levels were found to be only rarely differentially expressed . even under the loose definition of differential expression, among the  <dig> most highly expressed mirnas, only six show any significant differential regulation, while  <dig> are expressed at steady-state levels . we considered these highly steady-state expressed mirnas to be a distinct category of mirnas.

in summary, for the purpose of the analysis of mirnas described in this study we assumed that there are three major categories of mirnas expressed during the development of neuronal cultures: up- and down-regulated, and those expressed at high levels in a steady state fashion. for the annotated list of the  <dig> most highly expressed mirnas, and lists of the up- and down-regulated mirnas see additional file  <dig> and  <dig> 

when dealing with microarray data there is always a concern that technical biases, such as variability in hybridization efficiencies and other chip artifacts, may influence the results. therefore we randomly picked a highly steady-state expressed mirna and a relatively lowly expressed member of each of the two major categories of differentially expressed mirnas and profiled their expression by taqman qrt-pcr. the qrt-pcr data agree well with microarray data for the three cases that were tested .

role of highly expressed mirnas
the expression analysis described above provided insights into mirna expression but not necessarily function. in order to detect functional effects of these mirna signatures we utilised mirna seed analysis. positions  <dig> to  <dig> of the 5'end of a mature mirna have been shown to be most critical for defining specificity  <cit> , and we refer to this particular region as a mirna seed in this study.

the distribution of mirna seed matching sites  was assessed in 3'utrs using sylamer  <cit> . words complementary to seed regions of all profiled mirnas were analysed across the 3'utrs of all of the genes profiled in our experiments. one current view of the function of mirnas is that they not only modulate protein levels but frequently also trigger the degradation of mrnas upon binding to 3'utrs of target mrna transcripts  <cit> . thus observing significant extremes in the distribution of words in 3'utrs of transcripts sorted on average expression levels may indicate biological activity of corresponding mirnas  <cit> .

we found that several mirna specific words displayed significant depletion in 3'utrs of highly expressed genes . the most depleted  and the second most depleted  words in 3'utrs of highly expressed genes were entirely or partially complementary to the seed region of mmu-mir- <dig> . this mirna was previously implicated in the regulation of neuronal differentiation  <cit>  and has been suggested to have a function in maintaining neuronal identity  <cit> . we found that other words among the six most depleted corresponded to the seed regions of  <dig> more steady-steate highly expressed mirnas: the mmu-mir- <dig> family, mmu-mir- <dig>  mmu-mir- <dig> and the mmu-let- <dig> family. these mirnas were previously reported to be highly expressed in mammalian brain and to be involved in differentiation of neuronal progenitors  <cit> . our result adds to this notion by suggesting that the global function of these mirnas in neuronal cultures is closely related and complementary to that of mmu-mir- <dig> 

to extend the mirna targeting analysis, instead of using a particular significance threshold we analyzed rankings of mirnas based on word enrichment/depletion probability values . we estimated whether mirnas corresponding to the  <dig> most depleted/enriched words were expressed at significantly different levels to all mirnas on average . using this method we again found that the words corresponding to  <dig> mirnas identified with the word counting method  are depleted in 3'utrs of highly expressed genes. interestingly, this depletion was not observable after approximately  <dig>  3'utrs were examined . this indicates that targeting by highly expressed at steady-state levels mirnas is avoided by genes highly expressed during the course of neuronal culture development in this study. on the other hand, genes expressed at lower levels  may be targeted by this class of mirnas.

in accordance with this hypothesis, we found seed matching sites for highly expressed mirnas to be ranked among the most enriched in 3'utrs of genes expressed at lower levels. for example, when 3'utrs of approximately  <dig> of the most lowly expressed genes were considered, mirnas corresponding to the  <dig> most enriched words, were significantly more highly expressed than mirnas on average . four of the six most highly expressed of these mirnas were not differentially regulated and were among the top  <dig> most expressed mirnas in the neuronal cultures . additionally, we found many other mirnas with seed matching sites ranked as the most enriched to be expressed significantly higher than the average mirna expression level, albeit lower than "top 25" level .

overall we observed the seed matching site depletion of  <dig> highly expressed mirnas in 3'utrs of highly expressed genes and seed matching site enrichment of a wider range of relatively highly expressed mirnas in the 3'utrs of lowly expressed genes. these findings indicate that many of the putative targets of highly expressed mirnas are not among highly expressed typical neuronal genes , but rather among the genes which are expressed at lower levels, if reliably expressed at all. therefore, many of the putative targets are likely to be non-neuronal genes. for example, genes annotated to "immune response" gene ontology  term  <cit>   were very significantly enriched among the  <dig>  least expressed genes in neuronal cultures .

to complement the above enrichment analysis, we used traditional target prediction  to look for individual evolutionary conserved putative targets among neuronal genes. by the stage of e <dig>  the majority of neuronal progenitors had finished division and differentiated  <cit> . one might anticipate that mirnas that are highly expressed at this stage may participate in down-regulation of genes specific to progenitor maintenance. several signalling pathways were shown to be critically important for maintenance of progenitor division, e.g. the notch pathway  <cit> , fgf <dig> pathway  <cit> , ephrin b <dig> pathway  <cit>  and several others  <cit>  . some of the genes implicated in these pathways  have been shown to be highly expressed in brain during neurogenesis stage, but to be down-regulated afterwards  <cit> , i.e. within the time frame profiled in our experiments. indeed, conserved target sites of several steady-state highly expressed  mirnas can be found in 3'utrs of the selected key factors important for maintenance of the progenitor cells in undifferentiated state. six key factors for progenitor maintenance, including fgf <dig>  notch <dig> and efnb <dig>  contained such sites . observing evolutionarily conserved seed matching sites for a relatively small category of mirnas is an indication that these mirnas may be involved in the regulation of progenitor maintenance genes.

evolutionarily conserved sites complementary to seed regions of highly expressed mirnas  were found in 3'utrs of the genes previously shown to be involved in maintenance of neural progenitors: fgf <dig> - fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  <cit> , fgfr <dig> - fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig>  <cit> , efnb <dig> - ephrin b <dig>  <cit> , rgs <dig> - pdz-rgs <dig>  <cit> , notch <dig>  <cit>  and mef2d - myocyte enhancer factor 2d  <cit> . rna sequences in uppercase represent the seed matching sites  of aligned 3'utrs. all sequences are conserved between human, mouse, rat and dog. numbers in parentheses show the the positions of mature mirna sequences to which the 3'utr sites are complementary.

genomic distribution of mirna genes
it has previously been demonstrated that mirnas in genomic clusters can be co-expressed  <cit>  and can regulate genes involved in one biological pathway  <cit> . we sought to investigate if such a phenomenon takes place in neuronal cultures.

 <dig> differentially regulated mirnas  were mapped to  <dig> mirna genes with up-regulated expression and  <dig> genes with down-regulated expression during the developmental timecourse . these genes are situated in  <dig> genomic clusters of size two or larger .

we found that only five clusters comprised almost half  of all differentially expressed mirna genes. chromosome  <dig> had two clusters containing  <dig> and  <dig> mirna genes each, approximately  <dig> kb apart. these two clusters together included  <dig> mirna genes which were up-regulated during the neuronal development. similarly, the  <dig> down-regulated mirna genes were spread between three clusters: a cluster of six genes on the chromosome  <dig> and two clusters  on chromosome x around  <dig> kb apart. all genomic clusters were dedicated to one of the expression modes, i.e. under strict definition of differential expression no mirna genes were inversly expressed within one genomic cluster .

a different genomic distribution was found for mirna genes expressed at steady-state and high levels. the  <dig> mirnas most highly expressed at steady-state level  were mapped to  <dig> mirna genes. with the exception of one gene , none were situated in a genomic cluster of more than three mirna genes. in fact, only seven steady-state highly expressed mirna genes  genes were in clusters containing more than two genes. around 29% of all mirna genes were situated in clusters of that size or bigger. thus, mirna genes which are highly expressed at steady-state levels in neuronal cultures are under-represented in genomic clusters of more than two  or three  mirna genes.

we examined genomic features and potential regulatory sites of the mirna clusters described above using the mirbase genomics website  <cit> . of the five largest genomic clusters  three showed significant evidence for co-transcription and one also had an experimentally determined promoter associated regulatory motif.

relation of the seeds of differentially expressed mirnas
co-regulation of differential expression and co-localization of a large number of mirnas in the genome suggests to us that such mirnas are likely to be functionally related  <cit> . in order to further test this we looked at the relationship between mirna seed sequences in the two categories of differentially expressed mirnas. we obtained a list of conserved mirna families based on mirnas sharing common seed regions . we then defined families as being differentially expressed if any member of that family was differentially expressed in our study. we noted, that while many mirna families had more than one member, we have not found a single family containing both up-and down-regulated mirnas under the strict definition of differential expression.

to highlight the relation between the seed sequences of mirna families, we computed edit distances  between each pair of seed sequences of the differentially expressed families. the distance between the seeds of co-regulated mirna families was compared to the distance between the seeds of any two mirna families chosen at random. we found that seeds of co-regulated families were on average more closely related than random pairs of seed sequences .

predicted targets of differentially expressed mirnas
the presence of two reciprocal categories of differentially expressed mrna and mirnas suggests that mirnas can regulate inversely expressed mrnas. we also found that co-expressed mirnas with the same differential expression profile often were encoded in the same genomic locations and had related seed regions . taking these observations into account, we theorise that targets of co-expressed mirnas are likely to be also co-expressed and functionally related.

in order to test these propositions we have first obtained targets from targetscan  <cit>  for the families of  <dig> loosely defined down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated mirnas. we then tested if the expression of predicted targets is likely to be inverse to the expression trend of the respective mirnas. computational methods of mirna target predictions are prone to false positive predictions  <cit> . to reduce the noise we only analyzed targets among the top 35% most highly expressed genes and excluded any targets predicted for both down and up-regulated mirnas at the same time . in this way  <dig> and  <dig> highly expressed and distinct targets were predicted for down- and up-regulated mirnas respectively. as anticipated, predicted targets of down-regulated mirnas were on average up-regulated. conversely, targets of up-regulated mirnas were on average down-regulated between the first and the last timepoints. the expression trends  of the members of these two categories of predicted targets were significantly different .

it should be noted that inverse expression of mirnas and their targets is not the only possible mode of mirna-target interaction. in a small number of biological systems correlation, rather than inverse expression, of mirnas and their targets has been previously demonstrated for a number of mirnas  <cit> . however, during the developmental timecourse, including nervous tissue development, correlation of the expression of mirnas and their targets has been found to be either limited to a minority of mirna-target interactions  <cit>  or to be a feature of a late post-natal developmental onset  <cit> . in accordance with this, we observed that at least among highly expressed mrna genes, reciprocal expression is a predominant characteristic of predicted mirna-target interactions.

we tested whether specific biologically related gene sets could be found enriched in the two categories of predicted targets we obtained from targetscan. we assessed enrichment of go terms from biological process, molecular function and cellular compartment types of ontology  <cit> . gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that highly expressed predicted targets of down-regulated mirnas were most enriched in proteins with intracellular/cytoplasmic localizations. the sole enriched term from the biological process category was 'protein transport'. predicted targets of up-regulated mirnas were on the other hand predominantly enriched in 'organelle' localized proteins, with three out of four enriched terms in the biological process category being 'rna splicing', 'chromatin modification' and 'mrna processing' .

psp coding genes are critically important for functionality of individual synapses and brain as a whole  <cit> , therefore we specifically investigated if these genes are enriched among mirna targets. a significantly high proportion of psp genes are up-regulated during culture development . we therefore asked whether up-regulated psp genes were predicted to be targeted by differentially expressed mirnas. we found that up-regulated psp genes were significantly over-represented among the targets of down-regulated mirna genes , and not among the targets of up-regulated mirnas. interestingly, among the  <dig> up-regulated psp genes  predicted to be targeted by down-regulated mirnas, six were previously demonstrated to be involved in neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis .

in the top 35% most highly expressed genes  we also performed a network analysis of the inversly expressed predicted targets using reactome  <cit> . we identified  <dig> up-regulated genes targeted by down-regulated mirnas and  <dig> down-regulated genes targeted by up-regulated mirnas . we observed enrichment for a number of pathways and subnetworks for many genes .

targets of down-regulated mirnas were enriched in several metabolic pathways. numerous metabolic categories were found to be up-regulated during the course of the primary culture development . this result serves as another indication that down-regulated mirnas may regulate the transition to mature neuronal metabolism. significant enrichment of targets in 'signalling by ngf' pathway genes, supports this hypothesis, as ngf signalling is implicated in the survival of mature neurons  <cit> . genes important for synaptic transmission are also predicted to be targeted by down-regulated mirnas. for example, three members of 'synaptic transmission' subnetwork were among the targets of down-regulated mirnas , although this enrichment was not significant. at the same time the 'membrane trafficking' subnetwork was significantly enriched .

network analysis of the targets of up-regulated mirnas generally recapitulates the results obtained with go enrichment analysis . thus, subnetworks 'processing of capped intron-containing pre-mrna', 'gene expression', 'transcription' were found to be significantly enriched . in addition to that, we also identified enrichment for 'dna repair' and 'telomere maintenance' pathways. these findings further support the hypothesis that up-regulated mirnas are involved in termination of dna replication and finalizing switching to the established gene expression program, presumably the switch between the progenitor to mature neuronal cell program.

we predict the role of down-regulated mirnas to be the targeting of many up-regulated mrna coding genes, including many synaptic genes. therefore in the adult brain these mirnas are likely to be depeleted from the synaptic fraction, where many of the targets must be present at relatively high levels. we observed that the list of the four most down-regulated mirnas in our study is identical to the four mirnas most depleted in a synaptic fraction of the adult mouse forebrain  <cit> . this agrees with independent results obtained previously, using a different system and supports our hypothesis regarding the function of differentially regulated mirnas.

discussion
we found that most mirna genes, similar to protein coding genes, exhibited only two major modes of differential expression during differentiation and synaptogenesis in e <dig>  mouse primary neuronal cultures. one set of mirnas was continuously decreasing while another was continuously increasing in expression levels. analysis of mrna coding genes and mirnas displaying these two trends showed that mirnas were expressed inversely to their highly expressed predicted targets. this inverse relationship is consistent with previous results in other systems  <cit> .

those mirnas showing common expression profiles were found to cluster within genomic loci. in total, 47% of co-expressed mirnas were localized within just five genomic clusters on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and x. it was previously shown that mirna genes localized in the same genomic cluster can be co-transcribed, co-regulated, share evolutionary origin and have common functions  <cit> . thus it is likely that many co-expressed mirnas in neuronal cultures have related functionality. the fact that a significantly high proportion of mirnas, which are co-expressed in our study, have closely related seed regions supports this view.

through a combination of mrna and mirna expression profiling and computational target prediction, we studied the regulatory potential of expressed mirnas. it has previously been shown that mirna regulation can be observed at both the mrna  <cit>  and protein level  <cit>  and that there is reasonable agreement between the two.

co-expression of genomically co-localized mirnas and the apparent relatedness of their seed regions suggested using a combinatorial approach for functional analysis of predicted targets. the combined list of predicted targets of down-regulated mirnas showed a significant enrichment in psp genes. this implies that mirnas developmentally down-regulated at earlier stages participate in the repression of a number of key neuronal genes at the time when neuronal network activity is undetectable  <cit> . this is consistent with finding the enrichment of cytoplasmic localization, protein binding and transport activity go terms among the targets of the down-regulated mirnas. on the other hand, targets of up-regulated mirnas are not enriched in the psp genes. additionally, nuclear localization, rna splicing and chromatin modification go terms are enriched among the targets of up-regulated mirnas . thus it is possible that this category of targets was involved in the reprogramming of progenitor gene expression to a differentiated neuronal cell expression, which naturally occurs during the tested developmental time-window. this view is further supported by pathway/network enrichment analysis and suggests that mirna regulation is important for the organization of large sets of the neuronal proteome at different stages of development.

in addition to differentially expressed mirnas we have identified a third distinct type of mirna expression which is the steady-state expression at relatively high levels. many of the mirnas that were previously linked to neuronal biology   <cit>  belong to this category. interestingly, we found that steady-state highly expressed mirnas were predominantly located in isolated genomic loci rather than situated in genomic clusters of more than two mirnas. we also found words complementary to the seed regions of at least three steady-state highly expressed mirnas to rank among the most enriched words in 3'utrs of relatively lowly expressed genes. another  <dig> steady-state highly expressed mirnas left a clear imprint on the global mrna expression profile: a strong depletion signal for the seed-matching words of these mirnas was observed in the 3'utrs of highly expressed genes. these findings indicate that targets of many steady-state highly expressed mirnas are likely to reside among relatively lowly expressed genes. such categories of putative targets are likely to include many non-neuronal genes  and also genes involved in neuronal development at earlier timepoints .

CONCLUSIONS
computational predictions of mirna targeting are prone to produce false positive results and experimental validation is needed before a definitive conclusion is reached in any particular case. nevertheless, this large scale study provides a global view on mirna activity in neuronal cultures, which would be missing in a single gene approach. we identified three classes of mirnas with distinct properties and characterized their possible targets. this may be important for the design of future knockout or other perturbation experiments and gives a starting point in the elucidation of the roles of hundreds of mirnas in the development of neuronal cultures and hence synaptogenesis and formation of neuronal networks.
