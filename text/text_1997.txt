BACKGROUND
mesenchymal stem cells  are cells with the potential to differentiate into multiple cell types including osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes, and were shown to have trophic effects, modulate immune responses and promote healing in vivo  <cit> . in particular, the application of mscs for bone repair has shown clinical promise and there is continued research interest in this area  <cit> . human fetal bone marrow derived mscs  may be especially well suited for bone healing applications, as they can be maintained for many passages, have a faster doubling and greater osteogenic capacity compared to mscs from other sources, such as human umbilical cord-derived and human adipose tissue-derived mscs, and support in vivo bone formation .

despite the promise of msc-based therapies, msc incidence in donor tissue is low  <cit> , and the estimated dosages required for clinical efficacy are high, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> million cells per patient  <cit> . therefore, the commercial viability and clinical translation of msc therapies, especially those using allogeneic off-the shelf strategies, are hindered by challenges of scalable expansion of these cells  <cit> . current methods of msc expansion and production such as using stacked 2d surfaces as cell attachment substrates have limited scalability, are labor intensive and are costly when large numbers of cells are required  <cit> .

one potential method of scalable expansion of mscs involves the use of bioreactors for suspension culture and the use of 150–200 μm beaded microparticles, referred to as microcarriers, as cell adhesion supports. recent research indicates that microcarrier/bioreactor systems which are currently primarily used for vaccine production may be adapted for msc culture and may provide several benefits over current culture methods. firstly, 3d microcarrier-based systems are more scalable than 2d monolayer culture systems, allow for ease of cell sampling and monitoring, and are efficient in terms of space and culture media usage  <cit> . previous work in our lab has demonstrated efficient growth and differentiation of mscs expanded on microcarriers in agitation culture systems  <cit> . secondly, in addition to serving as support substrates for cell expansion, biodegradable 3d microcarriers  may potentially serve as scaffolds for in vivo msc delivery for selected applications such as bone healing, eliminating the need for enzymatic harvest of mscs from 3d microcarriers. this would require the development of biodegradable/biocompatible microcarriers.

in recent years there has been an increased research interest in the expansion and differentiation of mscs or osteoblast-like cells on various naturally-derived, synthetic and hybrid 3d microcarriers such as plga  <cit>  enref_ <dig>  peg  <cit> , pcl  <cit> , pla  <cit> , gelatin  enref  <dig> enref  <dig> enref  <dig> enref  <dig>  collagen-coated polystyrene  <cit> , gelatin-coated or uncoated dextran  enref  <dig> enref  <dig>  charged cellulose  <cit> , decellularized adipose tissue  <cit>  and calcium phosphates  <cit> . microcarrier-expanded mscs or microcarrier-laden mscs have been combined with other strategies such as growth factor delivery  <cit> , bioprinting  <cit> , sintering  <cit> , cell-microcarrier aggregation and perfusion  <cit>  or incorporation into scaffolds or hydrogels  <cit>  to enhance the cells’ regenerative potential, facilitate in vivo delivery or fabricate larger tissue constructs. collectively, these studies have demonstrated that efficient expansion and differentiation of mscs or osteoblast-like cells on microcarriers is feasible.

however, while much is known about the growth  <cit>  of mscs on microcarriers and to a lesser extent, on the mineralization potential of microcarrier-expanded cells, fewer studies have compared microcarrier-expanded cells, both harvested and unharvested, with conventional 2d monolayer harvested cells  <cit>  enref  <dig> to determine their phenotype and osteogenic differentiation potency. in this study, we expanded human fetal mscs  on 3d commercially-available cytodex  <dig> gelatin-coated dextran microcarriers in spinner flasks or as a control, on 2d tissue culture plastic and gelatin-coated monolayer surfaces and characterized them. following the expansion, we seeded and differentiated 3d microcarrier-bound , 3d microcarrier-harvested  and 2d monolayer-harvested  hfmscs on collagen-coated plates or polycaprolactone -tricalcium phosphate scaffolds and investigated mineralization as well as the expression levels of key osteogenic genes under these conditions. 2d gelatin monolayer-harvested  human fetal mscs on collagen-coated plates were also included as controls for the effects of gelatin on differentiation.

RESULTS
to investigate the effect of microcarrier culturing condition and enzymatic cell harvesting on hfmsc phenotype after cell expansion and during osteoblastic differentiation, we expanded hfmscs on microcarriers and monolayer cultures and osteogenically differentiated them with or without cell harvesting .fig.  <dig>

characterization of hfmsc expanded in 2d static monolayer and agitated 3d mc cultures
hfmscs were expanded on microcarriers in spinner flasks or 2d plastic flasks in monolayer cultures. cell seeding density was  <dig>  cells/cm <dig> for microcarriers  and  <dig>  cells/cm <dig> for plastic monolayers respectively to ensure that both cultures reached confluence after 7 days of expansion. doubling times were  <dig>  and  <dig>  h for microcarrier and monolayer cultures respectively. at cell harvest after 7 days of expansion, the cell densities of hfmscs were similar for microcarriers and plastic monolayer . at day  <dig> of growth, the hfmscs grew as monolayers in both mc cultures and 2d flasks, with no aggregation of mc cultures observed . cytokines were secreted in 3d mc cultures at higher specific production rates compared to 2d monolayer cultures. at day  <dig> of expansion, the specific production rates for 3d mc cultures over 2d monolayer cultures were  <dig> fold  for il- <dig>   <dig> -fold  for il- <dig> and  <dig>  fold  for cxcl <dig> .fig.  <dig> phenotype of s <dig> hfmscs expanded on 2d mnl or on cytodex  <dig> microcarriers  in a spinner flask. profile of cytokine production rates for  il- <dig>   il- <dig> and  cxcl <dig> as measured by elisa during the 7-day expansion. d cell surface marker expression of msc harvested from 2d mnl and 3d mc expanded cultures measured by flow cytometry. *p <  <dig>  for 3d mc-harv compared to 2d mnl-harv by 2-tailed t-test in graphpad



flow cytometry analysis of cell surface marker expression showed that 3d mc-harv hfmscs expressed equivalent high levels of international society for cell therapy  msc markers  and lower levels of the endothelial, pericyte-associated marker cd <dig>  and α <dig> integrin  and higher level of the pro-osteogenic α <dig> integrin , compared to 2d mnl-harv hfmscs . facs data for cell surface marker expression was not obtained on 3d mc-bound cells because facs analysis requires dissociating cells from the microcarriers. qpcr confirmed that the α <dig> integrin is upregulated in 3d mc-harv hfmscs compared to 2d mnl-harv hfmscs .

in summary microcarrier culture increases the cytokine production rate and changes the expression levels of some cell surface markers, but not the isct msc markers.

effect of hfmsc expansion methods on osteogenic differentiation 
to determine the effect of 3d microcarrier-based cell expansion on subsequent osteogenic differentiation, we measured gene expression and calcium deposition during osteogenic differentiation on collagen-coated 6-well plates seeded with 3d mc-harvested  and 2d monolayer-harvested  cells. cells expanded on 2d gelatin-coated monolayer cultures and enzymatically harvested  served as a control for the effects of gelatin coating during expansion, as the cytodex  <dig> microcarriers are gelatin-coated.

we examined early, and late osteogenic gene marker expression in hfmscs undergoing osteogenic induction in order to study their differentiation potential. cultures seeded with 3d mc-harv cells expressed higher levels of three early osteogenic markers, namely runx <dig>  alpl and osterix/ sp <dig> and one late osteogenic marker, ibsp at a single time point . despite the increased expression of these osteogenic markers, the mineralization of 3d mc-harv cells displayed slower kinetics compared to 2d mnl-harv cells. specifically, 2d mnl-harv cells have 55 % higher calcium per  <dig> cells at day  <dig> compared to 3d mc-harv cells  and also stain for alizarin red by day  <dig>  while 3d mc-harv cells do not stain at this timepoint . the control culture of 2d gelatin-mnl-harv hfmscs did not display enhanced expression of early osteogenic genes  when compared with 2d mnl-harv hfmscs . this suggests that the enhanced expression of early osteogenic genes in mc-harv hfmscs  is not due to the effects of the gelatin coating on cytodex  <dig> microcarriers but rather to the mode of propagation . similar levels of col1a <dig>  bmp2k, osteopontin/spp <dig>  osteocalcin/bglap and sparc gene expression level were observed in 3d mc-harv and 2d mnl-harv cells .fig.  <dig> kinetics of gene expression, cell growth and calcium deposition during osteogenic differentiation of collagen i-coated plates seeded with microcarrier-harvested  or 2d monolayer-harvested  s <dig> hfmscs. a osteogenic gene expression, early and late markers. values normalized to day  <dig> post-differentiation . n =  <dig> biological replicates per condition. b cell growth   and calcium deposition per  <dig> cells , . n =  <dig> biological replicates per condition. two-way repeated measures anova with post-hoc tukey correction was performed between 3d mc-harv and 2d mnl-harv and mc-bound cells using graphpad. of the multiple comparisons performed, data representing a single comparison  is shown in this figure



in agreement with results on the collagen-coated plates, on pcl-tcp scaffolds, 3d mc-harv cells also displayed increased expression of early  but not late osteogenic markers compared to 2d mnl-harv cells . in contrast with observations on the collagen-coated plates, the decelerated mineralization of 3d mc-harv cells on 3d pcl-tcp scaffolds were not as apparent based on alizarin red staining compared to 2d mnl-harv cells .

effect of hfmsc harvesting on osteogenic differentiation 
to investigate the effect of cell harvesting on hfmsc osteogenic differentiation, we compared the kinetics of osteogenic gene expression and calcium mineralization during the differentiation process carried out in 6-well plates seeded with 3d mc-bound and 3d mc-harv hfmscs.

we found that cultures seeded with 3d mc-bound cells showed increased expression of early osteogenic markers such as runx <dig>  alpl, and col1a <dig> as well as some late markers such as osteopontin/ spp <dig> and ibsp  compared to 3d mc-harv cells. consistent with the increased expression of both early and late osteogenic genes, mineralization was accelerated in 3d mc-bound cells compared to 3d mc-harv cells . the calcium production rate was  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold higher in 3d mc-bound cell cultures as compared to 3d mc-harv cells. it is important to note that the calcium deposition occurred in foci surrounding the seeded 3d mc-bound cells as shown by the alizarin red staining on day  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting that hfmscs attached to microcarriers have a higher mineralization potential.fig.  <dig> kinetics of gene expression, early and late markers, cell growth and calcium deposition during osteogenic differentiation of collagen i-coated plates seeded with microcarrier-harvested  or microcarrier-bound  s <dig> hfmscs. a osteogenic gene expression values normalized to day  <dig> post-differentiation . n =  <dig> biological replicates per condition. b cell growth   and calcium deposition per  <dig> cells , . n =  <dig> biological replicates per condition. two-way repeated measures anova with post-hoc tukey correction was performed between 3d mc-harv, 2d mnl-harv and 3d mc-bound cells using graphpad. of the multiple comparisons performed, data representing a single comparison  is shown in this figure



comparison of efficiency of osteogenic differentiation 
because the conventional method of in vitro expansion and msc delivery involves cell culture on 2d tissue culture plastic monolayers , we compared the osteogenic potential of 3d mc-bound cells to 2d mnl-harv cells. a control culture, 2d gelatin-mnl-harv hfmscs, was added as previously discussed. 2d gelatin-mnl-harv hfmscs did not show enhanced osteogenic gene expression or increased calcium deposition compared to either 3d mc-bound or 2d mnl-harv hfmscs for  <dig> hfmsc cell lines, s <dig> and s <dig> , showing that the gelatin coating during cell expansion do not affect osteogenic differentiation. in 3d mc-bound s <dig> cells differentiated on 6-well plates, gene expression levels of all  <dig> markers tested were elevated compared to 2d mnl-harv cells, in many cases at more than one time point . the genes that were upregulated in 3d mc-bound cells included early markers such as runx <dig>  alpl, col1a <dig>  osterix/ sp <dig> and medium to late markers such as bmp2k, osteopontin/spp <dig>  ibsp, osteocalcin/bglap and sparc . although osteogenic gene expression levels were higher in 3d mc-bound cells during differentiation, for the s <dig> line, calcium deposition levels were equivalent to 2d mnl-harv cells as measured by calcium assay  and qualitative alizarin red staining .fig.  <dig> kinetics of gene expression, early and late markers, cell growth and calcium deposition during osteogenic differentiation of collagen i-coated plates seeded with monolayer-harvested  or microcarrier-bound  s <dig> hfmscs. a osteogenic gene expression values normalized to day  <dig> post-differentiation . n =  <dig> biological replicates per condition. b cell growth   and calcium deposition per  <dig> cells , . n =  <dig> biological replicates per condition. two-way repeated measures anova with post-hoc tukey correction was performed between 3d mc-harv, 2d mnl-harv and 3d mc-bound cells using graphpad. of the multiple comparisons performed, data representing a single comparison  is shown in part  and  in this figure



when s <dig> hfmscs were osteogenically induced on pcl-tcp scaffolds, 3d mc-bound s <dig> hfmscs similarly expressed higher levels of runx <dig>  alpl, col1a <dig>  however there was no difference in the expression levels of osteopontin/spp <dig> and osteocalcin/ bglap . while mineralization on collagen plates was merely equivalent between 3d mc-bound and 2d mnl-harv cells, on pcl-tcp scaffolds, 3d mc-bound cells displayed accelerated mineralization compared to 2d mnl-harv cells .

in order to confirm the biological significance of our findings, we repeated our experiment with a second hfmsc line known as s <dig>  3d mc-bound s <dig> hfmscs showed upregulated gene expression of both early  and late markers   compared to 2d mnl-harv cells, confirming the result that was seen with 3d mc-bound s <dig> hfmscs. furthermore, 3d mc-bound s <dig> hfmscs showed improved calcium deposition per million cells compared to 2d mnl-harv .

discussion
fetal mscs are may be a suitable msc source for bone healing applications, as they have greater osteogenic capacity than umbilical cord- and adipose tissue-derived mscs  <cit> , and support in vivo bone formation . the expansion of mscs on microcarriers in bioreactors provides several advantages over current monolayer culture methods. these include scalability of culture in a cost effective manner  <cit> , and the potential ability to deliver cells post-expansion without a cell harvesting step on biodegradable microcarriers  <cit>  for selected applications such as cartilage and bone healing. however, the effects of msc culture in microcarrier/bioreactor systems and subsequent harvesting on cell phenotype and differentiation potential is not well understood.

hfmscs cultured on 3d microcarriers versus 2d monolayer displayed a higher specific production rate of the pro- and anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory  <cit>  cytokine il- <dig>  <cit>  which maintains stemness in mscs  <cit> , the pro-angiogenic chemokine il- <dig>  <cit>  and cxcl <dig>  a chemokine which attracts leukocytes as well as hematopoietic stem cell migration <cit> . these results suggest that the use of microcarrier-expanded hfmscs in immunoregulatory or angiogenic therapies may provide greater benefits than with standard 2d mnl-harv cells. however, further experiments will be required to establish if this is the case with in vitro potency assays.

the high expression levels of isct msc markers in hfmscs expanded in both stirred 3d mc and 2d mnl cultures indicate that the mode of expansion did not alter the msc-like phenotype of the hfmscs. however, we observed a downregulation of cd <dig>  an endothelial and pericyte marker, in 3d mc-expanded cells, and this effect also occurs in mscs in spheroid culture  <cit> , suggesting that the decrease in cd <dig> expression may be a response to the suspended nature of the cell culture.

osteogenically induced cultures seeded with 3d mc-harv hfmscs showed increased expression of early osteogenic genes and decelerated mineralization kinetics compared to 2d mnl-harv hfmscs. while the reasons for this effect is unknown, possible factors involved may include differences in the cell microenvironment during expansion including substrate stiffness, shear forces due to agitation culture, or adhesion to a curved versus flat surface.

3d mc-bound hfmscs showed improved osteogenic differentiation compared to both 3d mc-harv  and 2d mnl-harv hfmscs . 3d mc-bound show increased expression of some early  osteogenic genes, as well as accelerated mineralization compared to 3d mc-harvested hfmscs . however, our most important finding was the enhanced differentiation of 3d mc-bound hfmscs compared to 2d mnl-harv hfmscs. gene expression of osteogenic markers was elevated in 3d mc-bound s <dig> and s <dig> hfmscs compared to 2d mnl-harv cells . furthermore, 3d mc-bound hfmscs showed equivalent   or enhanced calcium deposition   compared to 2d mnl-harv cells, which represent the industry standard method of cell expansion. these results confirm previous work from our lab which demonstrate that microcarrier-expanded and microcarrier-bound hfmsc undergo efficient mineralization  <cit> .

the improved differentiation of 3d mc-bound hfmscs could be explained by a number of factors include the lack of disruption of ecm-integrin or cell-cell contacts, or the localized regions of high cell confluency on and around the microcarriers. in support of the first explanation, ecm-integrin  <cit>  interactions play an important role in directing cell fate and we observed large differences in integrin gene expression between the 3d mc-bound and 3d mc-harv cells . however, we also note that for 3d mc-bound hfmsc samples, alizarin red staining was higher on the cells attached to the microcarriers than on the cells which migrated off the microcarriers and onto the collagen-coated plate surface , suggesting that some aspect of the cell-microcarrier interaction enhances mineralization, in support of the second explanation. our findings of enhanced osteogenic differentiation on 3d mc-bound hfmscs raise questions of mechanism. the upregulation of osteogenic genes in 3d mc-bound hfmscs over both 2d mnl-harv and 2d gelatin-mnl-harv hfmscs, combined with the lack of enhancement in differentiation between gelatin coated and uncoated mnl-harv cells suggest that the results seen in 3d mc-bound hfmscs are not due to the gelatin coating on cytodex  <dig> microcarriers.

if the same enhancement of osteogenic differentiation occurs on other types of biodegradable/ biocompatible microcarriers, the expansion and delivery of hfmscs on these microcarriers may offer multiple advantages over current methods of msc expansion in 2d monolayer and harvesting prior to in vivo delivery for selected applications such as bone tissue engineering. these advantages include cost-efficient and large-scale production of hfmscs in controlled bioreactors, as well as the potential elimination of the cell harvested process for select in vivo applications, enabling faster and lower cost msc bioprocessing.

CONCLUSIONS
this study indicates that hfmscs which are cultured on 3d microcarriers in agitation culture and remain attached to cytodex  <dig> gelatin-coated dextran microcarriers  during osteogenic induction show enhanced osteogenic differentiation compared to hfmscs which are cultured under static conditions on 2d monolayer surfaces and are harvested prior to differentiation . if these results also occur in biodegradable/biocompatible microcarriers, the method of microcarrier-expansion and in vivo delivery of 3d mc-bound hfmscs may be a promising strategy which should be further evaluated for in vivo bone healing.
