BACKGROUND
glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, including the retina <cit> . it is released by the presynaptic cells and acts on n-methyl-d-aspartate , α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid , and kainite  receptors  <cit> . if excessive amounts of glutamate are released or if glutamate clearance is insufficient, neuronal death will result in a process known as excitotoxicity. the glutamate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity has been associated to various diseases of the brain and eye, which include alzheimer's disease <cit> , retinal ischemia <cit>  and glaucoma <cit> . although retinal ganglion cells  express all of three receptor subtypes, the glutamate toxicity is primarily mediated by nmda receptors  <cit> .

glaucoma, a neurodegenerative disease <cit> , is associated with selective death of retinal ganglion cells  <cit> . the disease is characterized by an elevation in intraocular pressure , which leads to increased glutamate levels  <cit> . vitreal glutamate levels are elevated in dogs <cit>  and humans with primary glaucoma  <cit> , and also in monkeys with experimentally induced chronic glaucoma <cit> . lowering iop is the current main treatment for glaucoma, yet disease progression continues to occur even in patients with significant iop reduction <cit> . therefore lowering iop is inadequate for glaucoma patients  <cit> . efforts have been made to attempt to discover appropriate drugs or chemicals  that can be taken orally to slow down retinal ganglion cell death and have negligible side-effects  <cit> . memantine is an uncompetitive nmda receptor antagonist which is prescribed for the treatment of alzheimer's disease  <cit> . however, two recent parallel clinical trials conducted to test the efficacy of memantine as a neuroprotectant for glaucoma were unsuccessful <cit> . the results of the trials showed that memantine had no significant effects in preserving visual function.

until now, there has been no neuroprotective agent indicated for the treatment of glaucoma. a neuroprotectant that has a single mode of action like memantine has a limited positive effect in slowing down ganglion cell death <cit> . pharmacological agents that simultaneously affect multiple biological mechanisms are consequently desired. this has been referred to as the "cocktail" approach  <cit> . one-drug-multiple-targets approach in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is possible way forward  <cit> .

beside nmda receptor antagonism, other strategies have been investigated in the development of neuroprotective therapies, which include voltage-dependent calcium channel blockade  <cit> , nitric oxide synthase  inhibition  <cit> , and so on. bis-tacrine , a dimeric acetylcholinesterase  inhibitor derived from anti-alzheimer's drug tacrine, possesses remarkable neuroprotective activities through concurrent inhibition of ache  <cit> , nmda receptor <cit>  and nitric oxide synthase  <cit> . moreover, bis-tacrine attenuates neuronal apoptosis by regulating l-type voltage-dependent calcium channels  <cit> . recent studies showed that bis-tacrine prevented glutamate-induced excitotoxicity by selectively inhibiting nmda receptors in primary cultured cerebellar granule neurons , without the involvement of the other two ionotropic glutamate receptors, ampa receptor and ka receptor  <cit> .

based on these evidence, we hypothesis that bis-tacrine attenuate glutamate-induced retinal ganglion cells damage through the blockade of nmda receptors. we tested the effect of bis-tacrine in two models of glutamate excitotoxity, rgcs in culture with glutamate and intravitreal injection of glutamate. the results showed that bis-tacrine reduced glutamate-induced retinal ganglion cells damage in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
identification of cultured rgcs
the purity of isolated rgcs was assessed by fluorescent microscope  using a uv filter that permitted the visualization of fluorogold fluorescence . rgcs were labeled by fluorogold in a retrograde manner. after a two-step immunopanning procedure, approximately  <dig> %  of the collected cells were labeled by fluorogold. because it is difficult to obtain uniform labeling, a small number of rgcs were probably not identified by retrograde transport, and the purity of the preparations was therefore underestimated.

bis-tacrine prevents glutamate-induced cell death more potently than memantine
glutamate toxicity was found to be concentration- and time-dependent, which was consistent with previous reports <cit> . at  <dig> days in vitro, rgcs were exposed continuously to 25- <dig> μm glutamate for  <dig> h and  <dig> μm glutamate alone at different times. cell viability was measured by mtt assay. glutamate induced a concentration- dependent loss in neuronal viability starting from  <dig> μm and peaking at  <dig> μm . glutamate at  <dig> μm induced a time-dependent neuronal death starting at  <dig> h and culminating at  <dig> h . rgcs were pretreated with  <dig> μm bis-tacrine for  <dig> h and exposed to different concentrations of glutamate for  <dig> h. with the increase of glutamate concentrations, the neuroprotective effects of bis-tacrine gradually decreased and completely lost when rgcs were exposed to over  <dig> μm glutamate . bis- tacrine at  <dig> μm retained its neuroprotective effects for at least  <dig> h after glutamate stimulation . rgcs were pretreated with the gradually increasing concentrations of bis-tacrine or memantine for  <dig> h and then exposed to  <dig> μm glutamate for  <dig> h. it was found that bis-tacrine and memantine prevented glutamate-induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner with ic <dig> values of  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm, respectively . bis-tacrine inhibited the glutamate-induced cell death more potently than memantine.

bis-tacrine reduces glutamate-induced apoptosis of rgcs in vitro
the anti-apoptotic effects of bis-tacrine were studied using an annexin-v fitc/pi assay. the results demonstrated that  <dig> μm glutamate induced apoptosis in a time-dependent manner and bis-tacrine could prevent glutamate-induced apoptosis . although the initial  <dig> h of glutamate exposure did not change the percentage of apoptotic cells relative to the control group, there were marked increases in the percentage of apoptotic cells after  <dig> h  and  <dig> h . bis-tacrine inhibited glutamate-induced damage to rgcs in a concentration-dependent manner. at  <dig> h, bis-tacrine at  <dig>  μm has a tendency to reduce glutamate-induced damage, but bis-tacrine , as well as memantine , decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells to  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % respectively . at  <dig> h, all the concentrations of two drugs, bis-tacrine  and memantine , reduced effectively the percentage of apoptotic cells, but only with bis-tacrine  show no significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in comparison with control group.

bis-tacrine reduces glutamate-induced apoptosis of rgcs in vivo
apoptotic changes in the retina were assessed by the tunel method. little tunel positivity was observed in the control  group . however, at  <dig> h after glutamate was injected into the eyes, prominent tunel-positive cells were found in the ganglion cell layer and the inner nuclear layer  . the density of tunel-positive cells in gcl was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cells/mm in the glutamate group whereas it was  <dig>  ±  <dig> /mm in the animals receiving bis-tacrine at  <dig>  mg/kg  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> / <dig>  mm when the dose of bis-tacrine was  <dig>  mg/kg . compared with the glutamate group, there was no statistically significant reduction when animals receiving bis-tacrine at  <dig>  mg/kg . the results showed that bis-tacrine rescued these neurons from apoptosis which was induced by glutamate in a dose-dependent manner. memantine  showed the same protective effects as bis-tacrine .

bis-tacrine protect rgcs in experiments using retrograde labeling of rgcs
the gcl is composed of about equal numbers of rgcs and displaced amacrines <cit> . to ensure accurate identification of rgcs, we retrogradely labeled the rgcs in rats with fluorogold allowing us to selectively label greater than 99% of the rgcs. in pbs-injected eyes without glutamate, the mean density of rgcs was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cells/mm <dig>  . fifteen minutes after intraperitoneally injection of bis-tacrine, memantine or pbs,  <dig> nmol glutamate was injected intravitreally into the same animals. at  <dig> days after glutamate injection, the mean densities of the rgcs in control  and experimental -tacrine and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> mg/kg memantine) eyes were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cells/mm <dig> , respectively, and the different was statistically significant -tacrine, p =  <dig> ; pbs vs  <dig>  mg/kg bis-tacrine, p <  <dig> ; pbs vs  <dig> mg/kg memantine, p <  <dig> ). these data showed that both of bis-tacrine and memantine possessed neuroprotective effects against glutamate-induced rgcs death, and bis-tacrine  had the same effects as memantine .

discussion
glutamate excitotoxicity is thought to contribute to a broad variety of neurological diseases, including alzheimer's disease and glaucoma. in retina tissues, the predominant form of glutamate neurotoxicity is mediated by overstimulation of the nmda subtype of glutamate receptors, which in turn causes an increase of ca2+ influx, followed by cell death  <cit> . recent research demonstrated that bis-tacrine prevented glutamate-induced cerebellar granule neurons  apoptosis through directly blocking nmda receptors  <cit> . we show here that bis-tacrine provided in vitro and in vivo neuroprotective effects on glutamate-induced rgcs damage. although the cytoprotective actions of bis-tacrine have previously been observed in brain neurons under excitotoxic/ischemic conditions <cit> , to our knowledge, this is the first report to elucidate the neuroprotective action of bis-tacrine on rgcs in response to glutamate excitotoxicity.

some researches have reported that rgcs are highly susceptible to glutamate toxicity in vitro and in vivo <cit> . first of all, we explored the in vitro effectiveness of bis-tacrine against glutamate-induced rgcs damage. in a previous report, glutamate toxicity was concentration-dependent with a calculated ec <dig> of  <dig>  μm <cit> . in our study, the mtt assays have shown that cultured rgcs are highly sensitive to  <dig> h  <dig> μm glutamate treatment, which produces 50% or greater cell death. furthermore, bis-tacrine, like the nmda receptor antagonist memantine, has been confirmed to attenuate the cytotoxic effect of glutamate. as memantine showed affinity and potency comparable to those of bis-tacrine in blocking the nmda receptor  <cit> , we chose memantine as the positive control in this study. the minimal effective concentration of bis-tacrine against glutamate excitotoxicity was approximately  <dig>  μm. the combination of data from the mtt assays and the annexin v-fitc/pi assays, provided strong evidence that bis-tacrine was significantly more potent than memantine in inhibiting glutamate-induced cell damage. this finding was similar to previous reports in cultured rat cortical neurons <cit> .

next, we verified the neuroprotective effects of bis-tacrine in animal models of glutamate-induced retinal injury. the pharmacokinetic research in the body of the rat showed that bis-tacrine was rapidly and widely distributed to its target tissues such as brain <cit> . in a model of acute focal cerebral ischemic insults in mcao rats, bis-tacrine at doses of  <dig>  mg/kg and  <dig>  mg/kg significantly reduced ischemic impairment in vivo <cit> . in the current study, two animal assays showed that bis-tacrine protected rgcs from glutamate excitotoxicity, while bis-tacrine had no significant neuroprotective effects.

we cannot definitively state that bis-tacrine was neuroprotective for retinal ganglion cells alone. in retina tissues, several cells express nmda receptors, such as rgcs and displaced amacrine cells <cit>  in the retinal ganglion cell layer and bipolar cells <cit>  in the inner nuclear layer . these cells are susceptible to excitotoxic cell death, we did not differentiate between retinal ganglion cells and other cells.

neuroprotection was initially studied as a treatment strategy for various neurological disorders including stroke, dementia, multiple sclerosis, alzheimer's disease and glaucoma. despite successful preclinical cell culture and animal model experiments, most of these therapies were not successful at the clinical stage of testing because of either unacceptable side effect profiles or a lack of efficacy  <cit> . high affinity nmda receptor antagonists such as mk- <dig> are undesirable as they entail nonselective inhibition of tonic glutamate activity as well as phasic physiological nmda receptor function  <cit> . memantine is a moderate affinity, uncompetitive nmda receptor antagonist prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe alzheimer's disease  <cit> . however, recent clinical findings showed that there was no clear benefit after glaucoma patients received memantine; thereby it was suggested that neuroprotectants with multiple modes of actions were likely to reveal clearer results than was found for memantine  <cit> .

the preclinical studies demonstrated that bis-tacrine had low toxicity in animal models <cit> , and bis-tacrine possessed multiple physiological activities including anti-nmda receptors, anti-ache, anti-l-type-voltage-dependent calcium channels, anti-nitric oxide synthase  signaling and the regulation of the downstream signal of nmda receptors  <cit> . in the present study, bis-tacrine prevented glutamate-induced rgcs damage possibly by inhibiting nmda receptors. at this point, electrophysiology studies will be needed to verify the blocking kinetics of bis-tacrine on three glutamate receptors in the purified rgcs. what's more, further calcium imaging studies will be required to determine the role of calcium permeation through nmda receptors and to determine if intracellular calcium is involved in triggering neuroprotection or inhibiting glutamate excitotoxicity. besides inhibiting nmda receptors, the other effects of bis-tacrine on rgcs deserves further study.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our experiments have demonstrated that bis-tacrine can provide neuroprotection against glutamate-induced retinal ganglion cells damage in vitro and in vivo. the effects may be achieved through inhibitions of nmda receptors. this neuroprotective effects of bis-tacrine may lead to a novel approach for the treatment of retinopathies, such as glaucoma.
