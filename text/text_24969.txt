BACKGROUND
the coordination of multiple events during m phase is essential for accurate chromosome segregation. mitotic checkpoints ensure that chromosomes and the spindle are correctly aligned, and mitotic kinase activity prevents cytokinesis from occurring before mitosis is completed. budding yeast is an excellent model system to study the complex regulation that couples mitotic exit with the onset of actomyosin ring contraction to complete cell division.

the mitotic checkpoint in budding yeast has two separate pathways, one for sensing kinetochore attachment to microtubules, and another for sensing spindle position  <cit> . the first pathway requires a number of known genes, including mad <dig>  and acts to prevent the metaphase to anaphase transition  <cit> . the second pathway relies on the bub2/bfa <dig> complex to inhibit mitotic exit  <cit> . both pathways must be intact for complete arrest of the cell cycle in mitosis in response to microtubule depolymerization, as deletion of genes in a single pathway results in a cell cycle delay after which cells exit mitosis  <cit> .

the spindle orientation pathway inhibits exit from mitosis through negative regulation of the mitotic exit network   <cit> . tem <dig>  a small gtpase at the top of the pathway, is activated by its gef lte <dig>  and inactivated by the two part gap bub2/bfa <dig>  <cit> . the men regulates both mitotic exit and the onset of cytokinesis and septation. men activation leads to mitotic cyclin degradation, and the inactivation of mitotic kinase activity is required for cytokinesis  <cit> . in addition, some men proteins localize to the bud neck at the time of cytokinesis, and tem <dig> has been shown to be required for myosin contraction  <cit> . examination of actin ring formation in apc2– <dig> mutants with and without a bub <dig> deletion led to the hypothesis that the bub <dig> pathway acts to prevent premature actin ring formation  <cit> . this model predicts that bub2Δ cells will form actin rings earlier than bub <dig> cells under conditions where the bub <dig> checkpoint pathway is normally activated. it has also been proposed that bub <dig> acts every cell cycle to restrain tem <dig> activity until the end of mitosis  <cit> , in which case even unperturbed cells lacking bub <dig> may show premature actin ring formation. here, we test these hypotheses by examining actin ring formation in synchronized cells with and without nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules and cause checkpoint activation. we found no evidence that the bub <dig> checkpoint pathway acts to prevent premature actin ring formation, but we did see an effect on myosin contraction in bub2Δ cells, as well as a septation defect in cells overexpressing a dominant negative bub <dig> 

RESULTS
the bub <dig> checkpoint pathway does not regulate actin ring formation
previous studies showed that deletion of bub <dig> led to men dependent actin ring formation in an apc2– <dig> mutant at the non-permissive temperature  <cit> . this led to the hypothesis that the bub <dig> branch of the spindle assembly checkpoint specifically prevents premature actin ring formation. to test this idea, we looked at the timing of actin ring assembly in synchronized cells. wild-type, bub2Δ, mad2Δ, and bub2Δmad2Δ cells were arrested in g <dig> using α-mating factor. after release from the arrest, cells were fixed at 10-minute intervals as they progressed through the cell cycle and stained for actin filaments. as shown in figure 1a, actin ring formation peaked  <dig> minutes after release from g <dig> arrest in all strains. therefore, deletion of bub <dig> did not noticeably affect the timing of actin ring formation in a normal cell cycle.

we next examined actin ring formation after perturbation of the cell cycle using nocodazole, a drug that causes microtubule disassembly. as before, wild-type, bub2Δ, mad2Δ, and bub2Δmad2Δ cells were arrested in g <dig> using α-mating factor. cells were released from the arrest into media containing  <dig> μg/ml nocodazole, fixed at 10-minute intervals, and stained for actin filaments. as expected, wild type cells did not form an actin ring due to cell cycle arrest . cells lacking either bub <dig> or mad <dig> formed actin rings with the same kinetics, with actin rings peaking at  <dig> minutes after release from g <dig> arrest . the delay in actin ring formation in these strains relative to untreated cells is consistent with the cell cycle delay caused by loss of one of the two spindle damage checkpoints  <cit> . double mutant bub2Δmad2Δ cells had peak actin ring formation at  <dig> minutes , the same as unperturbed cells , consistent with the complete loss of mitotic spindle checkpoints in the double mutant.

our data show that actin ring formation in the presence of nocodazole occurs at the same time in bub2Δ cells as mad2Δ cells. additionally, bub2Δmad2Δ cells form rings at the same time with or without microtubules. therefore, bub <dig> does not specifically restrain actin ring formation in response to spindle damage.

bfa <dig> does not show a bub <dig> independent effect on actin ring formation
it has been proposed that bfa <dig> has bub <dig> independent functions, as overexpression of bfa <dig> causes mitotic arrest even in the absence of bub <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we analyzed actin ring formation in synchronized bub2Δbfa1Δ and mad2Δbfa1Δ cells with and without nocodazole to see if deletion of bfa <dig> had an additional effect. in unperturbed cells, actin ring formation peaked at  <dig> minutes in wild type controls as well as bub2Δbfa1Δ and mad2Δbfa1Δ cells, the same as in bub2Δ and mad2Δ cells . in nocodazole, bub2Δbfa1Δ cells had a peak of actin ring formation at  <dig> minutes, the same as in bub2Δ cells . nocodazole treated mad2Δbfa1Δ cells had a peak of actin ring formation at  <dig> minutes, similar to mad2Δbub2Δ cells in nocodazole and untreated cells . therefore, we found no evidence for bfa <dig> having a bub <dig> independent effect on actin ring formation.

the rate of myosin contraction is affected by bub2
previous studies have suggested that the men regulates actomyosin ring contraction  <cit> . to test this hypothesis, we examined myosin contraction using myo1-gfp in bub2Δ cells and compared myosin dynamics in bub2Δ cells to wild type and mad2Δ. cells expressing myo1-gfp were filmed at one-minute intervals on agarose pads and analyzed as described in methods. cells had a band of myo1-gfp fluorescence across the bud neck that began to decrease in size at the onset of cytokinesis . the total time of contraction was measured from the time when the myo1-gfp band began to decrease in size until myo1-gfp was no longer visible at the bud neck . for wild type cells, the time of contraction was an average of  <dig>  min , consistent with previously published results   <cit> . deletion of bub <dig> resulted in a more rapid contraction,  <dig>  min , . in contrast, deletion of mad <dig> resulted in a slightly slower average time of myo1-gfp contraction,  <dig>  min , although this difference was not significantly different from wild type . we also calculated the average rate of contraction by measuring the width of the bud neck and dividing by the time of contraction. deletion of bub <dig> resulted in a significantly increased rate,  <dig>  μm/min, compared to  <dig>  μm/min in wild type cells . the rapid contraction of the myo1-gfp ring in bub2Δ cells prevented the observation of a clear "dot" of myosin signal normally seen at the bud neck at the end of cytokinesis . analysis of fluorescence intensity profiles indicated that the myo1-gfp signal ingressed equally from both sides without a loss of intensity. overall, this data shows that the bub <dig> checkpoint pathway has an effect on the timing of actomyosin ring contraction, while the mad <dig> branch of the pathway does not.

bub <dig> overexpression affects myosin contraction and causes septation defects
since bub2Δ caused an increase in the rate of contraction, we wanted to determine if overexpression of bub <dig> would slow contraction. bub <dig> tagged at the n terminus with t <dig> and at the c terminus with 6his under control of the inducible gal <dig> promoter  <cit>  was integrated into wild type cells expressing myo1-gfp. these cells were grown in ypr, and then arrested in g <dig> with α factor with the addition of galactose for three hours to induce bub <dig> expression. after release from g <dig> arrest, myo1-gfp images were captured as cells underwent cytokinesis. unexpectedly, bub <dig> overexpression increased the speed and rate of myo <dig> contraction similar to bub2Δ . this result could be due to the overexpressed bub <dig>  which is tagged with t <dig> and 6his, acting as a dominant negative. see additional file  <dig> for a time-lapse image of myo1-gfp following bub <dig> overexpression.

we further investigated the effects of t7-bub2-6his overexpression by comparing cells with the gal1-t7-bub2-6his construct grown in conditions to repress  or induce  expression. all strains showed a similar level of bub <dig> protein expression when grown in ypgr . as shown previously, cells exhibited slower growth on ypgr plates compared to ypd  <cit> . the slow growth was evident even in bub2Δ and bfa1Δ backgrounds . this growth defect was rescued by co-overexpression of tem <dig> using the gal <dig> promoter . these data support the idea that the t7-bub2-6his acts as a dominant negative.

the overexpression of this bub <dig> construct has been reported to cause a cytokinesis defect, although the data was not shown  <cit> . to study this effect more closely, we determined effects on cell morphology by examining cells grown in ypd or ypgr with and without zymolase treatment to remove the cell wall. in a wild type background, cells with the gal1-t7-bub2-6his construct grown on ypd had a very low incidence of the chain phenotype, defined as three or more cell bodies . after induction of bub <dig> overexpression, an average of 53% of cells exhibited the chained phenotype . after treatment with zymolase, the chains were reduced to 42% on average . in support of the idea that gal1-t7-bub2-6his acts in a dominant negative fashion, the effect of overexpression was similar in a bub2Δ strain, with  <dig> % of bub2Δ cells exhibiting a chain phenotype before zymolase, and 43% after zymolase treatment . if the epitope-tagged bub <dig> were acting the same as endogenous bub <dig>  one would expect the phenotype to be relieved, rather than exacerbated, by deletion of bub <dig>  this data also shows that deletion of bub <dig> does not cause a cytokinesis or septation defect, as wild type cells and bub2Δ cells had similar numbers of chained cells on ypd . unlike the previous report  <cit> , we did not find that deletion of bfa <dig> rescued the chain phenotype . the morphological defects were rescued by co-overexpression of tem <dig>  which reduced the percentage of chained cells in ypgr to similar levels as in ypd . together, our data shows that overexpression of a t7-bub2-6his fusion protein acts as a dominant negative, causing a chained cell phenotype that can be rescued by tem <dig> overexpression. the results of the zymolase assay suggest that overexpression of bub <dig> caused both a cytokinesis and a septation defect.

because the percentage of chains caused by bub <dig> overexpression decreased about 10% in zymolase, we examined plasma membrane and cell wall formation after bub <dig> overexpression. the plasma membrane was visualized using fm 4– <dig>  and the cell wall was stained using calcofluor. examination of chains with three of four cell bodies, formed after eight hours of bub <dig> overexpression, showed that chains typically had plasma membrane across some bud necks, but not others . in contrast, these chains showed a complete lack of cell wall formation at all bud necks . this result was surprising, since the zymolase assay  suggested greater defects in cytokinesis than septation. therefore, we repeated the analysis after fifteen hours in ypgr. most bud necks showed plasma membrane formation between cell bodies, although in some cases the plasma membrane had abnormal bright dots or clumps at the bud neck . only the buds at the end of the chains did not have plasma membrane, consistent with being the most recently formed buds. cell wall formation looked very different after the longer bub <dig> induction, with most bud necks now showing septum formation, although in many cases the septa seemed thicker and brighter than normal . these results suggest that overexpression of the dominant negative bub <dig> causes primary septum formation to fail, but over time cells may be able to separate by forming an abnormal secondary septum .

discussion
regulation of actin ring formation
the men pathway in budding yeast regulates cytokinesis as well as exit from mitosis. however, how the men controls cytokinesis is not understood. experimental evidence that actin rings form in apc2– <dig> bub2Δ cells suggested that the bub <dig> checkpoint pathway prevents premature actin ring formation  <cit> . however, this hypothesis is inconsistent with data showing that tem <dig>  the target of bub <dig> regulation, is not required for actin ring formation  <cit> .

our examination of actin ring formation in bub2Δ and bfa1Δ strains shows that actin ring formation occurs with normal kinetics in the absence of the bub <dig> checkpoint. although it is possible that bub <dig> or bfa <dig> has a subtle effect on actin ring formation that was missed by the  <dig> minute intervals used to examine the cells, this seems unlikely, as our data is consistent with previous results showing that bub2Δ does not advance anaphase onset  <cit> .

bub <dig> and mad <dig> are required for two separate branches of the mitotic spindle checkpoint in budding yeast. our data show that cells lacking either one of these checkpoint pathways form actin rings with the same kinetics after nocodazole treatment. therefore, the delay in actin ring formation in bud2Δ and mad2Δ cells is caused by a cell cycle delay. the actin rings seen in apc2– <dig> bub2Δ cells  <cit>  are likely due to loss of cell cycle arrest and subsequent downstream events such as actin ring formation. in fact, the authors noted that apc2– <dig> cells remained arrested in mitosis, while apc2– <dig> bub2Δ cells exited mitosis after two hours  <cit> . therefore, progression through late anaphase, when men mutants arrest, is required for actin ring formation, but there is no evidence that the men regulates actin ring formation directly.

our data also do not support a bub <dig> independent function of bfa <dig> in actin ring formation. there was no apparent difference in the timing of actin ring formation in unperturbed or nocodazole treated cells in isogenic strains with and without a bfa <dig> deletion.

the men and actomyosin ring contraction
one way the men may act to regulate cytokinesis is to trigger the onset of myosin contraction. our data show that deletion of bub <dig> or overexpression of a dominant negative bub <dig> decreases the total time for contraction of the myosin ring and increases the rate of contraction. this effect on myosin contraction could either be due to direct regulation of contraction by the men or an indirect effect caused by defects in primary septum formation. previous studies have shown that preventing primary septum synthesis results in a cytokinesis failure due to premature breaking and disassembly of the actomyosin ring  <cit> .

we do not think our results are due to indirect effects of septation defects for two reasons. firstly, we did not see any evidence of abnormal or asymmetrical contraction in bub2Δ or gal1-t7-bub2-6his cells, which would be predicted by this model. secondly, bub2Δ cells showed no evidence of a defect in primary septum formation, yet still exhibited the myosin contraction phenotype. our results suggest that men activation directly influences either the onset or the rate of myosin contraction, and that the bub <dig> checkpoint pathway acts as a brake on actomyosin ring contraction. this model is also supported by previous results showing that tem <dig> and mob <dig> are required for actomyosin ring contraction when the requirement for men function in mitotic exit is bypassed  <cit> . the men therefore has a role in promoting cytokinesis that is separate from its role in mitotic kinase inactivation. in contrast, the role of the men in promoting primary septum formation depends only on exit from mitosis  <cit> . the identification of men targets involved in the regulation of actomyosin ring contraction will be of great interest. potential targets include iqg <dig>  which has been shown to interact with tem <dig> in vitro, and hof <dig>  which is phosphorylated in a men-dependent manner  <cit> .

dominant negative effects of bub <dig> overexpression
the gal1-t7-bub2-6his construct used in this study has been previously described as partially inhibiting cell growth only in the presence of bfa <dig>  <cit> . it was also reported to cause a chained cell phenotype, although this data was not shown. we have confirmed that this construct causes a mild growth defect as well as a chain phenotype on galactose-containing media in our strain background. however, we did not find that deletion of bfa <dig> rescued either the growth defect or the chain morphology caused by overexpression of the bub <dig> fusion protein. we have further examined the chained cell phenotype, and found evidence for the presence of both cytokinesis and septation defects.

we obtained this construct in the hopes that overexpressing bub <dig> would decrease the rate of myosin contraction, since deletion of bub <dig> increased the rate. however, we found similar rates of myo1-gfp contraction in cells expressing t7-bub2-6his and bub2Δ cells. this is most likely due to the t7-bub2-6his acting as a dominant negative that interferes with normal tem <dig> function. supporting this conclusion, overexpression of an untagged bub <dig> using the gal <dig> promoter does not result in a growth defect  <cit> . interestingly, overexpression of bfa <dig> has a different phenotype than overexpression of either untagged or dominant negative bub <dig>  bfa <dig> overexpression arrests cells in mitosis, and this arrest does not require bub <dig>  <cit> .

causes of cytokinesis and septation defects
interestingly, we did not observe a correlation between increased rates of myosin contraction and cytokinesis or septation defects. deletion of bub <dig> or overexpression of bub <dig> had a similar effect on myo1-gfp dynamics, but only bub <dig> overexpression resulted in the chained cell phenotype. therefore, the significantly increased rate of myosin contraction we observed does not have an effect on cell morphology under normal growth conditions.

how then does overexpression of a dominant negative bub <dig> cause morphological defects? our data suggest that the t7-bub2-6his must be affecting tem <dig> in a way that does not prevent exit from mitosis, but perturbs septum formation. a temperature sensitive mutant of the men kinase cdc <dig>  cdc15- <dig>  has been shown to have a septation defect when grown at the semipermissive temperature   <cit> . since binding of cdc <dig> to tem <dig> is required for cdc <dig> activation and prevented by bub2/bfa <dig>  the interaction of cdc <dig> with tem <dig> could be partly inhibited by t7-bub2-6his overexpression  <cit> .

zymolase treatment of cells after fifteen hours of bub <dig> overexpression resulted in approximately 10% fewer chains than without zymolase, suggesting that some of the chains were due to septation failure, and most of the chains were due to cytokinesis failure. however, staining of plasma membrane and cell wall structures at earlier timepoints showed that lack of septum formation was the primary defect . staining at later timepoints indicated that many of the bud necks in the chains had become separated by plasma membrane and chitin, some of which appeared abnormal  and may represent the deposition of thick secondary septa that eventually separate the cells, sometimes trapping pockets of membrane within. electron microscopy has shown that yeast cells that fail cytokinesis due to lack of myosin and those that fail to form the primary septum due to a lack of chitin synthase have identical phenotypes  <cit> . in both cases, the cells form a thick cell wall that lack the normal trilaminar structure  <cit> . it is unclear whether or not zymolase can efficiently digest this abnormally thick septum. therefore, the zymolase assay may not be able to distinguish failure to contract an actomyosin ring from failure to build a primary septum, since in both cases the cells can eventually separate the plasma membrane by lateral thickening of the cell wall. additionally, it has been shown that preventing primary septum formation causes instability of the actomyosin ring  <cit> . therefore, the two processes of cytokinesis and septation may be so closely linked in budding yeast that defects in one process result in problems in the other.

we think it is likely that the formation of chains of cells after overexpression of a dominant negative bub <dig> is caused by a failure to form the primary septum, and that these cells eventually form an abnormal septum as seen previously by em. the contradictory results from the zymolase assay may be due to incomplete digestion of these thick septal structures, failing to separate the chained cell bodies even though they are separated by plasma membrane. together, our data suggest that the bub <dig> pathway, and therefore the men, regulates septation or the coordination of septation with actomyosin ring contraction.

CONCLUSIONS
deletion of bub <dig> did not affect the timing of actin ring assembly, but did increase the rate of myosin contraction. overexpression of a tagged bub <dig> protein caused septation defects that were rescued by tem <dig> overexpression. together, the data suggest that the men regulates actomyosin ring contraction and septation.
