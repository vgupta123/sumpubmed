BACKGROUND
the deliberate or accidental translocation of species from their native habitat to new environments by humans  <cit>  may trigger substantial environmental effects  <cit> . the consequences for native biodiversity and their economic impact have been a focus of many ecological and conservation-related studies  <cit> . for example, approximately 40 % of the species listed as threatened or endangered under the endangered species act of the us are considered to be primarily at risk through competition with or predation by invasive species  <cit> . the economic costs caused by invasive species through environmental damage and losses are perceived as a major concern throughout the world  <cit> . considering australia, the focus of this study, the economic impact of  <dig> key vertebrate pest species has been calculated at  <dig> million australian dollars per annum  <cit> . the introduction of invasive species, historical changes in land use and habitat transformation in australia have led to the extinction of approximately  <dig> terrestrial vertebrate species and a critically endangered status for  <dig> others  <cit> .

over the last few hundred years the number of species invasions has increased by orders of magnitude worldwide  <cit> . this is true of australia  <cit>  for which two of the  <dig> invasive mammalian species are predators: the european red fox  and the domestic cat   <cit> . cats are the subject of this paper and as invasive domesticates may be grouped into three categories:  feral cats are defined as free-living, independent of humans and reproducing in self-perpetuating populations.  stray cats, rely to some extent on human provision . these were originally housecats that went astray and now refrain from human contact.  housecats and fancy breed cats that depend almost entirely on humans  <cit> .

feral cats have established long-lasting and stable invasive populations over large geographical areas. there is strong evidence that cats have a detrimental impact on native wildlife, driving the declines of bird, mammal and reptile species  <cit> . attempts to reintroduce threatened species in the arid zone of australia have often failed because of extensive predation by feral cats  <cit> .

although feral cats do not depend on humans, they derive from cats that did; and the genetic equivalency is informative. therefore, the current populations of cats may, through genetic analysis  <cit> , allow inferences about the mostly maritime introduction history and routes. cats were likely domesticated around  <dig>  years ago in the near east, perhaps first associating with early human settlements because the presence of rodent pests provided prey opportunities, and becoming a companion animal thereafter  <cit> . once domesticated, cats would have been moved around by humans. especially since  <dig>  domestic cats have actively been transported on sailing vessels of explorers, sealers, whalers and colonists either for controlling rodents or as pets - first on board and later in new settlements  <cit>  leading to the global distribution of cats covering most continents and even remote islands  <cit> . feral cats can thus derive from this deliberate transport, or from cats that were transported accidentally - which may have happened quite frequently with large ships.

the origin and sequence of invasions of cats into australia is unresolved . it would be reasonable to suggest that cats may be a relatively recent introduction with european explorers and settlers in the late 18th century  <cit> . another alternative assumes cat arrival to australia prior to european settlement from  shipwrecks in western australia around  <dig>   or with malaysian trepangers from about  <dig> in northern australia,  or even earlier with the introduction of the dingo  around 4500 years ago  .

admixture of putative cat source populations is almost certain to have been of importance. even if cats were first introduced from asia, it is likely that there has been interbreeding with cats from secondary multiple introductions at various occasions by european settlers  <cit>  and continuously since then through stray housecats from mixed geographic origin . in order to unravel the evolutionary history and dispersal patterns of australian feral cats, we applied a phylogeographic approach covering the australian mainland and offshore islands. theoretical and empirical studies have shown that hybridization and intermixing through multiple introductions is less likely to occur on islands than in comparable mainland populations  <cit> . thus, island populations may be genetically representative of the original founder population.

we therefore analysed samples from six mainland and seven island locations including australian indian ocean territories  island; hereafter referred to as cocos island) as well as samples from southeast asia and previously published data from europe  <cit> . christmas and cocos islands were inhabited by european merchants during the time of exploration and settlement of australia  <cit> . microsatellite and mitochondrial dna data were used to address the following specific questions:  do australian cat populations share alleles and haplotypes with european and/or asian populations?  what is the regional genetic population structure and how many genetically distinct groups exist across australia? we discuss our findings in the context of historical reports about the early exploration and settlements in the australasian region. we follow a phylogeographic approach for the study of human-mediated movement of commensals, domesticates and other species closely associated with people  <cit> .

RESULTS
genetic population structure and differentiation using microsatellites
we genotyped  <dig> individuals representing  <dig> sampling locations at  <dig> microsatellite loci, one of which was excluded because of null alleles   <cit> . for the remaining  <dig> loci the expected heterozygosity was high, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . australian mainland locations exhibited the highest genetic diversity . the mean number of alleles per locus varied greatly between populations ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . christmas island  and the australian mainland location in the south, cape arid , had the largest number of alleles with  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the observed heterozygosity was always lower than the expected heterozygosity  reflecting presumably a degree of inbreeding or population substructure.table  <dig> microsatellite statistics of australian and southeast asian populations

the major portion of nuclear genetic variation was found within populations  with  <dig>  %  among the four geographic regions  and  <dig>  %  among populations within regions.

mitochondrial phylogeography
in total  <dig> base pairs of the mitochondrial segment were sequenced. altogether we detected  <dig> haplotypes in the dataset of which  <dig> were present in the european populations . all other populations  exhibited between  <dig> to  <dig> haplotypes, and had haplotype diversities of  <dig> –  <dig>  and nucleotide diversities of  <dig> –  <dig> .

the bayesian phylogenetic tree  revealed the two major clades described by driscoll et al.  <cit>  for european cats, clade i and iv . clade i only represents the european wildcat sequences from driscoll et al. all the australasian samples were of clade iv together with european sequences from driscoll et al. within clade iv, subclades a and c of driscoll et al. can be seen. a small subclade of australian samples  could not be matched with certainty with driscoll et al.’s subclades. the largest subclade  consists of a mixed group of australian islands  and mainland  populations and samples from southeast asia, christmas and cocos island and throughout europe. subclade c mainly consists of samples from asia, christmas island, tasmania, tips south west and western and central europe.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of mtdna haplotypes. bayesian phylogenetic tree of mtdna haplotypes of cats from australia and southeast asia in the context of previously published data . the nomenclature of clades and subclades follows driscoll et al.  <cit> . the numbers of individuals per location are given and the highest posterior density  represented at the node



pairwise population comparisons showed low genetic differentiation between samples from europe and elsewhere  and between samples from asia and elsewhere . significant strong genetic differentiation to most other populations was found for cif , for fl  and tasm. very low genetic differentiation was found between tas, tsw, cif and eu with pairwise fst values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> .table  <dig> genetic differentiation among populations

discussion
overall, our analyses are in line with the hypothesis of an introduction and establishment of cats in australia from britain and other western and central european locations as documented by abbott  <cit> . abbott inferred multiple coastal introductions between  <dig> -  <dig>  rather than a spread from the earliest point of colonization   <cit> . there was no evidence of a separate and stable feral cat population originating solely from asian locations . we assume a secondary introduction of asian cats following european colonization indicated by a grouping of asian locations with australian samples  and a low genetic differentiation to western australian locations . there is an indication of bidirectional movement of cats between australia and asia additional to the european colonization in the highest supported model . however, caution is needed in inferring the involvement of asian cats in the history of cat colonization in australia due to the small number of asian samples. the second most likely introduction scenario  includes direct introduction of european cats to asia, while model  <dig> does not show this direct introduction. thus, what we call ‘asian cats’ here plausibly derive from europe as well.

the likelihood of survival of a few introduced founder individuals in a foreign environment may be low due to the presence of native or previously introduced predators   <cit>  and increased genetic drift and inbreeding  <cit> . these genetic effects have been documented in a survey of cats of the kerguelen archipelago . in contrast, moderate or even increased levels of genetic variation of founder populations indicate invasion from multiple sources, predisposing successful introduction and long lasting establishment of invasive species  <cit> . multiple introductions leading to inter-mixing among individuals from genetically divergent populations may result in higher genetic variation in founder populations than in original populations  <cit> . overall genetic diversity levels in australian cats was found to be similar to that of european domestic cats .

we observed that genetic differentiation among mainland australian populations is low, in contrast to island populations that were substantially differentiated among each other and from mainland populations. this population structure is most likely explained by relative isolation of islands compared to mainland populations. exceptions from this general pattern are explained by human activities and their main pathways of trading and exploitation. our results showed that the dhi population exhibits a relatively high genetic diversity  and is genetically distinct except for some of the nearest mainland populations . between  <dig> and  <dig> pearling was at its peak in the shark bay area, resulting in housing of workers on dirk hartog island and the peron peninsula  <cit> . archeological remains indicate a large impact of malaysian workers operating on pearling vessels and historical records state exchange between their homes in malaysia and shark bay, western australia  <cit> . the first report of a cat on a pearling lugger  was recorded on dirk hartog island in  <dig>  <cit> . later, cats were assumed to have been brought over during the time that the island was used as a pastoral sheep and goat station  <cit> . a recent study showed regular gene flow between the western australian mainland and dhi during the last decade, which has now ceased  <cit> . since the introduction of cats to the island,  <dig> of the  <dig> native terrestrial mammals once present are now locally extinct, most probably due to the predation by cats  <cit> .

the scenario selected in the model selection approach showed dispersal of cats from europe to australia and secondary introductions leading to gene flow between cocos and christmas island, asia and australia . cocos island was inhabited around  <dig> by european merchants accompanied by malaysian workers  <cit> . one of the merchants built a settlement on christmas island supplying the growing industry on cocos island  while travelling regularly between singapore and the two islands  <cit> . extensive travel between australia, cocos and christmas island as well as southeast asia  <cit>  is consistent with the results of the model selection approach for cat introductions over the past 200 years.

cats from dirk hartog island are found in several subgroups of the mitochondrial phylogenetic tree, together with west australian localities . thus, these dirk hartog island cats were likely of european or mixed european-asian origin deriving from populations in western australian settlements which themselves originated possibly from shipwrecks around  <dig> and definitely with substantial european visitation since  <dig> . the main introduction of cats onto dirk hartog island happened, at latest, during its main use as a pearling site around  <dig> and  <dig>  therefore, we can suggest multiple invasions of cats in western australia from europe and southeast asia in the 19th century, providing a timeframe for the impact of feral cats on native species. our greater understanding about the history of australian feral cats may help to assess the relative impact of other non-native predators  on native species prior and post european settlement  <cit> .

the patterns of human colonization are mirrored in cat genetic data from tasmanian populations  and its neighbouring islands, tasman island  and flinders island . although these islands lie closely together, feral cats of tas cluster  into completely different groups from the cats of tasm and fl . at the beginning of the 19th century cats were introduced to tasmania during european settlement together with various workers  of numerous industries . the settlement and these industries would have resulted in regular visits to tasmania, tasman and flinders islands, by ships and traders on their way to the australian mainland, european or asian locations. feral cats were present on tasman island following the construction of the lighthouse and eradicated in  <dig> . cats on fl might have been present since the early 19th century with a small settlement established by sealers, later used to exile the remnants of the tasmanian aboriginal human population. tasm and fl did not experience a major human influx from europe or asia . feral cats on the islands have therefore been more or less isolated from interbreeding with domestic fancy cat breeds being introduced as house pets. in contrast, tas has been populated by up to  <dig>  people  since the first settlement. in  <dig> the australian bureau of statistics estimated that  <dig>  % of pet owners had cats as household pets and  <dig>  % of the households in tas reported problems with stray and feral cats . previous studies have documented the extensive predatory impact of stray and feral cats on native fauna in suburban, rural and pastoral areas of australia and indicated the possibility of intermixing between stray/domestic and feral cats  <cit> . clearly, tasmania must be affected in both ways. therefore, we should take into account that large numbers of fancy breed and domestic cats from the australian mainland were brought onto the island intermixing with the original feral cats. this is also supported by the low genetic differentiation between tasmania and tips south west  , since tsw represents a mixture of stray, feral, domestic and fancy breed cats. although all three islands  were among the first islands on which cats were known to be introduced  <cit> , only flinders island and tasman island are genetically differentiated from all other australian populations. we hypothesize that these populations consist of the descendants of the original invading lineages during the 19th century. in contrast to many other australian populations, they remained largely isolated from subsequent mixing. thus these island populations provide valuable information to trace back the global invasion routes of cats. interestingly, cats from flinders and tasman islands have close affinity, in terms of microsatellites, with the cocos islands. these microsatellite characteristics may thus be representative of the early colonizing cats according to best supported migration model .

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate a mainly european origin of feral cats in australia with possible secondary introductions from asia following the initial establishment of cats in australia. although this reflects the best-supported model by the model selection approach, models tested were limited to those from a series thought reasonably likely to represent regional history.

with regards to colonization history, it should be emphasised that cats on the islands surrounding australia are of particular interest and may represent founding populations. taken together with historical record, the genetic data suggest introduction of cats to australia mainly following european settlements, providing an important timeframe for the impact of feral cats on native species in australia. further precision may be possible with more detailed  genetic data and a search for archaeological specimens, which themselves may be subject to genetic analysis.
