BACKGROUND
plant cells respond to attack signals from pathogens that activate their systemic defense systems  <cit> . pathogens secrete a diverse effector proteins into the apoplast and cytoplasm of host cells. effector proteins not only function directly as toxins to induce plant cell death, but also suppress or evade plant defense responses, thereby favoring early pathogen colonization  <cit> . while some bacteria and fungi produce structurally diverse cytolytic toxins that kill plant cells directly  <cit> , a much broader group of organisms, including prokaryotes  <cit> , and eukaryotic oomycetes   <cit>  and fungi produce necrosis-inducing proteins  that cause cell death while stimulating the plant’s immune reaction  <cit> . nlps were first purified from culture filtrate of fusarium oxysporum f. sp. erythroxyli and named ‘necrosis and ethylene-inducing proteins’   <cit> . many other nlps have been isolated from bacteria, fungi, and oomycete plant-pathogens and there is increasing evidence that the different nlps have the ability to induce cell death and ethylene accumulation in plants  <cit> . the nlp proteins usually possess an n-terminal secretion signal peptide and are apoplastic effectors that compose a superfamily of secreted phytotoxic proteins  <cit> . notably, nlps are expressed inside cells, which may make them less active, but cell lysis and subsequent release of the proteins into the apoplast induces cell death for some of the constructs  <cit> . in addition to plasma membrane targets, the association of nlp proteins with nuclei of sensitive plant cells has also been recorded  <cit> . most identified nlps not only trigger cell death but also elicit strong immune responses in a large number of dicotyledonous plants and are frequently associated with plant perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns   <cit> .

the disruption of some nlp genes in some pathogens such as f. oxysporum f. sp. erythroxyli and mycosphaerella graminicola does not reduce their virulence  <cit> . similarly, mutants of bcnep <dig> or bcnep <dig> in pathogenic strains of botrytis cinerea result in virulence similar to that of the wild type strains  <cit> . however, there is strong evidence that nlps function as virulence factors that accelerate disease and pathogen growth in host plants. for example, the disruption of both eccnlp and ecanlp isolated from erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora and subsp. atroseptica result in decreased virulence on potato  <cit> . likewise, the over-expression of nep <dig> in a hypovirulent strain of the fungus colletotrichum coccodes markedly increased its virulence toward abutilon theophrasti and extended the host range of this pathogen  <cit> . nlppya was identified from pythium aphanidermatum, a species that causes similar responses in host and nonhost dicotyledonous plants  <cit> . all those reports indicate that nlps from different pathogens play distinct roles and that the characteristics of nlps during infection of plants by pathogens merit further exploration.

the genus phytophthora comprises a group of filamentous fungus-like organisms that includes some of the most notorious plant pathogens  <cit> . pathogenesis by phytophthora species requires their ability to induce cell death in their hosts  <cit> . until now, only a few phytophthora nlp proteins have been studied in any detail. psnlp <dig> codes for a necrosis inducing protein that is secreted by p. sojae during infection of nicotiana benthamiana <cit> , but the varying patterns of expression of other members of the psnlp family suggest that it has been a positive selection for diversification of function of genes within the family during infection of soybean  <cit> . npp <dig> from p. parasitica induces a rapid immune response and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in its hosts  <cit> . notably, the npp gene family of p. infestans was shown recently to encode a different type of phytotoxic protein that was not correlated with the sequence of nlps  <cit> . the genes pinpp <dig> , pinpp <dig> , and pinpp <dig>   were shown to undergo a diversifying selection in late blight during infection of potato by p. infestans <cit> . these pinpp genes are similar to pinpp <dig> , but not pinpp <dig>  or pinpp <dig>  encoded the putative secreted proteins that triggered cell death in potato  <cit> . one nlpp gene was identified from p. parasitica that induced similar responses in host and nonhost dicotyledonous plants  <cit> . however, some nlp genes from p. infestans and p. megakarya were always strongly expressed during the early biotrophic infection phase  <cit> . all these reports suggest that nlps from phytophthora species have different functions in the infection process, but there has been little done to functionally characterize these proteins. moreover, expansion of nlp gene families in the genomes of p. capsici, p. infestans, p. ramorum, and p. sojae, which provided sufficient data for further functional evaluation of relaxed selection by a different process.

the structure of nlps is remarkably conserved over extraordinary phylogenetic distance. the structure of nlps of stramenopiles p. parasitica and p. aphanidermatum, and the bacterium pectobacterium carotovorum have a high level of conservation of a central hepta-peptide motif “ghrhdwe”, and four amino acid residues within their crystallized structures  correlate with the qualitative and quantitative biological activities of respective nlps  <cit> . the folding of nlps is also similar to that of cytolytic toxins secreted from marine organisms. despite the recognized influence of nlps in the complex plant/pathogen interaction, questions persist concerning nlps  <cit> . are nlps from unrelated organisms functionally conserved as well? do the necrotic-inducing activities of nlps facilitate the pathogen’s ability to infect and induce symptoms? are the toxic/necrotic and defense-stimulating activities of nlps mechanistically linked?

p. capsici causes various disease symptoms in a number of important vegetable  <cit>  and has been found around world  <cit> . p. capsici was originally considered to be specific to pepper, but is now known to cause blight disease on many other plants  <cit> . p. capsici also secretes a class of effectors, termed rxlrs, that enable parasitic infection and reproduction during infection of different plants  <cit> . secretion and translocation of the effectors require the presence of a signal peptide, followed by a conserved n-terminal rxlr motif  <cit> . more than  <dig> putative candidate rxlr effectors in the p. capsici genome have been identified by genome-wide searches for rxlr coding genes  <cit> . however, the roles of the rxlr effectors in p. capsici-host interactions are unknown. the potential studies will reveal the exact roles of rxlr effectors during p. capsici–host interactions. another class of cytoplasmic effectors has been identified in the secreted proteins of p. infestans; these cause ‘crinkling and necrosis’ phenotypes, named ‘crn’  <cit> , in leaves. crn proteins share a highly conserved lqlflak motif required for translocation and a conserved n-terminal region, and in some cases they have a predictable signal peptide. approximately  <dig> full-length crn coding genes and more than  <dig> pseudogenes have been identified in the p. capsici genome by computational surveys  <cit> . feng et al.  <cit>  identified additional secreted proteins of  <dig> pcnlps in p. capsici as possible virulence factors. considering the activity of pcnlps in the induction of cell death, these pcnlps were proposed to contribute to the transition from biotrophy to necrotrophy  <cit> , in which  <dig> pcnlp genes were shown to be highly expressed during infection by p. capsici. however, their functional roles in virulence remain to be determined. thus, further functional investigation of the pcnlps should illuminate their roles in the virulence of p. capsici. notably, inf <dig> elicitin induced necrosis activity is required for full virulence of p. infestans, p. sojae, and p. cryptogea <cit> . additionally, several bacterial and fungal pathogens produce elicitins that induce avirulence toward a resistant host species  <cit> . at the same time, the function of inf <dig> elicitin has been confirmed to act as an avirulence factor in p. parasitica-tobacco interactions  <cit>  and has also been proposed to be a component of nonhost resistance of nicotiana species to p. infestans and other elicitin-producing phytophthora species  <cit> . overall, inf <dig> could be regarded as a reference function gene when analyzing the function of nlps from phytophthora species that secrete a different type of phototoxic protein.

in the current publication we provide an analysis of the function of the  <dig> highly expressed pcnlp genes that have been previously identified in p. capsici in our laboratory  <cit> . our objectives were to define variation in their function, to use leaf infiltration assays to determine whether any of them play important roles in necrosis or cell death-inducing activity, and to determine whether any of them have phytotoxic activity in host and non host species.

RESULTS
expression patterns of pcnlp genes during p. capsici infection
the pcnlp genes were identified in the p. capsici genome on the conserved ghrhdwe motif in the doe joint genome institute database  using a tblastn program by an expected  cut off value <10- <dig>  we identified  <dig> putative nlps containing the conserved ghrhdwe motif. among these npps,  <dig> were single copy, while the rest were multicopies ranging from 2– <dig>  <cit> . we previously cloned  <dig> nlps in p. capsici sd <dig>  and named them sequentially from pcnlp <dig> to pcnlp <dig>  <cit> . moreover, we then identified  <dig> putative nlps in the p. capsici genome  under these conditions. as shown in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig> putative nlps were identified for further functional evaluation. on the basis of sequence homology analysis, we found that each of three genes  is also a fragment of a single longer nlp gene, and pcnlp <dig> is a fragment of pcnlp <dig>  here, we cloned the full-length of pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig>  whereas previously we cloned only fragments of them  <cit> . amino acid sequences were deduced from the open reading frames; none of them has an intron. the protein sequences of these pcnlps were submitted to signalpv <dig>   for secreted signal peptide prediction. pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp6- <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcinf <dig> had a signal peptide consisting of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues , which was predicted to regulate the secreted proteins. the other pcnlp did not have a predicted signal peptide and therefore may not secrete the pcnlps proteins into the apoplast in native mycelia. nine were single copy while the rest have from 2– <dig> copies each, and pcinf <dig> has  <dig> copies . notably, four other pcnlp genes  have the restriction enzyme sites as predicted with dnaman, thus, these four genes were not compatible for functional analysis. moreover, the mrna expression of  <dig> genes can be detected by rt-pcr , indicating that their transcripts are present. thus, only  <dig> genes were selected for functional analysis during infection by p. capsici .

*the pcnlp genes were selected for functional analysis. ‘y’ has a signal peptide. ‘n’ has no a signal peptide.

on the basis of sequence homology analysis, these  <dig> pcnlps shared a conserved ghrhdwe motif and a relatively conserved hexapeptide qdlimw at the c-terminal end. these characteristics identify any new peptide sequence as an nlp. each pcnlp gene has four potentially coding residues that most likely correspond to the residues existing in the crystal structure of an nlp of pythium aphanidermatum <cit> . these residues were numbered as d <dig>  h <dig>  d <dig>  and e <dig> in the pcnlp <dig> structure .

the mrna expression of many pcnlp genes during infection by p. capsici has not been examined previously. in order to determine the expression patterns of these  <dig> targeted pcnlp genes at different time points after infection using zoospores, we performed qrt-pcr analysis. we used a cycle threshold  cut-off value  as a detection limit, and none of these  <dig> targeted genes produced ct values below this threshold at any of the sampling points. the qrt-pcr melting curve of each pcnlp gene was amplified by specificity of the qrt-pcr primers as shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  pepper leaves showed different degrees of lesion formation at different post-inoculation times . water-soaked lesions were first observed at  <dig> to 2 days post-inoculation . the leaf lesions gradually expanded around the inoculation point from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi. within  <dig> dpi necrotic areas in the lesions were noted, and the lesions were nearly completely rotten at  <dig> dpi. after  <dig> dpi, the mrna could still be extracted from parts of the lesions but after  <dig> dpi the mrna could not be extracted from the lesions. total mrna was only extracted from frozen lesions at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpi, or from filtered mycelium of wild-type strain sd <dig> using the trizol procedure. thus, it was impossible to analyze mrna expression levels related to infection time up to  <dig> dpi by qrt-pcr. three housekeeping genes of p. capsici and pepper were used as constitutive expression internal controls and were used jointly as a reference to the microarray data of qrt-pcr detection. figure  <dig> shows mrna expression patterns of  <dig> pcnlp genes between the two experimental assays using qrt-pcr. five  reached the highest expression levels at  <dig> dpi, followed by a gradual decline, especially noted for pcnlp <dig>  which showed the greatest expression over the period of  <dig> to  <dig> dpi. the expression of five other genes  gradually increased to a maximum at  <dig> dpi; of these, pcnlp <dig> was expressed at the highest levels. therefore, pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> were, overall, the most strongly expressed during infection by p. capsici. in figure 2a, from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi, these  <dig> pcnlp genes are classified into different transcription types based on their average induction levels. also, pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> showed the highest expression levels but pcnlp <dig> and pcnlp <dig> showed higher transcription levels than the six other genes. in contrast, six other genes  showed low transcription levels, especially, three  showed the lowest transcription levels. all of these data indicate that these  <dig> targeted pcnlp genes are expressed at different levels at different times and contributed to different transcription types on the mrna expression levels, suggesting that each targeted gene affects cells or tissues differently depending on the stage of infection.

functional analysis of pcnlp genes by pvx vector agroinfection assay in pepper and tobacco plants
to determine whether any of the targeted pcnlp genes are capable of inducing necrosis in c. annuum, the usual host of p. capsici, and n. benthamiana which is not normally a host of this pathogen, we agroinfiltrated host cells with a pvx vector pgr <dig>  <cit>  that carried each of the pcnlp genes from which a predicted signal peptide was not removed. in fact, some pcnlp genes contained sequences of the native signal peptide which secreted pcnlps proteins from cytoplasm into apoplast of the mycelium. in this case, however, all these targeted pcnlp genes produced directly the secretion pcnlps proteins in plant cytoplasm or apoplast after being agroinfiltrated into the plant tissue with pvx vector, where they functioned to degrade plant cell walls . this is not related to the presence or absence of a signal peptide in the pcnlp when they are agroinfiltrated into the plant tissue. each leaf was simultaneously inoculated with pcinf <dig>  empty-vector, and distilled water. representative phenotypes of all tested pcnlp genes and pcinf <dig> are shown in figures 2a and 3a.

the diameter of necrotic spots in both plants was significantly larger when pcinf <dig> was injected than those of each targeted pcnlp gene. the results were consistent with previous results  <cit> . notably, the degree of symptom development in pepper leaves in response to each pcnlp gene was noticeable elevated compared with the response in tobacco leaves. at the same time, the necrotic response in pepper leaves caused by pcinf <dig> was stronger than that in the tobacco leaves . the empty-vector pgr <dig> and distilled water control did not induce any chlorosis or necrosis in either plant. this experiment demonstrated that the induction of most targeted pcnlp genes could trigger chlorosis or necrosis in leaves of pepper or tobacco independently of the pcinf <dig> gene.

in our experiments, each targeted pcnlp with an ha tag was associated with a distinct chlorotic or necrotic response in c. annuum and n. benthamiana . in order to further determine the necrosis-inducing activity of the pcnlp genes, western blot was used to determine whether the ability to induce chlorosis or necrosis was associated with the expression of the pcnlp proteins. the total proteins of agroinfiltrated leaves expressing pcnlp or pcinf <dig> with an ha-tag were extracted for western blot experiments. western blots revealed that all of the pcnlp proteins and pcinf <dig> are detectable in the lesions of c. annuum and n. benthamiana , but none of the pcnlp genes were detectable in the wild-type leaves . surprisingly, only three  caused the largest necrotic areas in both hosts  at  <dig> dpi , suggesting that these three genes could contribute strongly to virulence during infection by p. capsici. in the leaves of c. annuum, the expression of three genes  induced distinct chlorosis at  <dig> dpi , and all the chlorotic areas gradually turned brown and became moderately necrotic at  <dig> dpi . the expression of two other genes  caused only small yellow areas at  <dig> dpi; these areas expanded somewhat and became necrotic at  <dig> dpi . there was no visible reaction of c. annuum to pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> for several days, but by  <dig> dpi small necrotic lesions were visible . in n. benthamiana, the expression of pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> caused strong necrosis at  <dig> dpi, similar to what was seen in c. annuum at  <dig> dpi , and the expression of pcnlp <dig> caused only small necrotic areas at  <dig> dpi . seven genes  only resulted in chlorotic areas, without necrosis at  <dig> dpi . the smallest chlorotic areas were induced by pcnlp <dig> at  <dig> dpi, and the chlorotic areas caused by pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> were larger than those caused by pcnlp <dig> and pcnlp <dig> . therefore, the members of the pcnlp family are similar to pcinf <dig> in their ability to induce chlorosis or necrosis during infection of pepper and tobacco, but the necrotic or chlorotic response caused by the targeted pcnlp genes and pcinf <dig> was stronger in pepper leaves  than in tobacco leaves  . in figures 2b and 3b, all  <dig> pcnlp genes showed different toxicity on leaves of c. annuum and n. benthamiana within 7 days of agroinfiltration. in summary, pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> always induced the strongest toxicity on the leaves of both hosts by  <dig> dpi, but eight other genes induced low toxicity on the leaves of both hosts by  <dig> dpi . however, pcnlp <dig> and pcnlp <dig> induced higher toxicity on leaves of c. annuum than that of the six other genes  by  <dig> dpi . in contrast, these six other genes induced low toxicity on leaves of c. annuum, especially, pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> which induced the lowest toxicity by  <dig> dpi.

these results demonstrated that most of the members of the pcnlp family can express in host c. annuum and non-host n. benthamiana plants by triggering chlorotic or necrotic responses. they further suggest that individual pcnlp genes have different phytotoxic effects during infection by p. capsici, but that pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig> and pcnlp <dig> may play important roles in symptom development and may be crucial for virulence and necrosis-inducing activity or cell death. moreover, the pcnlps can trigger a disease response in tobacco but the effect in this non-host was muted when compared to the response in the usual host.

site-directed mutation of pcnlp1
pcnlp <dig> was chosen for site-directed mutagenesis because its expression levels were similar to those of other pcnlps. it provided a readily identifiable phenotype in pepper and tobacco leaves, and it was one of the proteins that were predicted to be secreted during infection. to further confirm the functions of pcnlp in vitro, we created five mutations in pcnlp <dig>  and constructed a pvx vector for each mutated residue. the ability to induce necrosis or cell death was tested on tobacco and pepper plants by agroinfection with pvx in the same manner as previously described. none of the mutated residues triggered a hypersensitive response in leaves of either plants after  <dig> dpi. representative phenotypes of the five mutations were shown in figure 4a, b. pcinf <dig> and unmutated pcnlp <dig> always induced a necrotic response around the point of inoculation of leaves of both plants . the empty-vector pgr <dig> and distilled water did not cause any response in leaves of either plant. these results indicated that these four conserved residues in the pcnlp <dig> protein  were likely responsible for the induction of necrosis or chlorosis, and indicate that each of the amino acid mutations possesses the effect on regulating the active sites of the pcnlp <dig> protein, as well as those of other pcnlps proteins. dna sequences of pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp1d112a, pcnlp1h120a, pcnlp1d123a, pcnlp1e125a, and pcnlp1d112/h120/d123/e125a were presented in supplementary materials .

generation of stable transformation lines, qrt-pcr analysis and impaired virulence
we attempted to develop stable transformations for each pcnlp gene through polyethylene glycol -mediated protoplast gene-silencing  <cit> . a total of  <dig> putative transformant strains were grown on a selection medium with 50 μg/μl g <dig> . seven putative pcnlp transformant lines  were obtained using rt-pcr detection . the bands from the transformants were faint or missing when compared to p. capsici strains sd <dig> and ck. each transformant line was initially expected to contain a trigger gene as follows: a <dig> , a <dig> , o <dig> , m <dig> , h <dig> , s <dig> , s <dig> . in these experiments, we used the total length of each gene to be silenced. the observed patterns of silenced genes were unexpected. several members in the pcnlp family were almost simultaneously silenced in each transformant line. as shown in figure  <dig>  the asterisk  indicates that the different silenced genes occurred simultaneously in each of the transformant lines. as is also shown in figure  <dig>  each transformant line contained several silenced genes, and each silenced gene was assigned to the transformant line. these results are possible only if all targeted genes shared a relatively high sequence similarity. in these seven transformant lines, no differences in growth rate, hyphal development, sporangial morphology or size, or numbers of zoospores released were observed when compared with sd <dig> and ck .

to more directly evaluate the contribution of each pcnlp gene to p. capsici toxicity, we employed qrt-pcr to evaluate transient expression of each silenced gene in putative transformant lines compared with sd <dig> and ck, using rnas extracted from growing mycelia. three housekeeping genes, identified from the microarray data as constitutively expressed, were used jointly as a reference to relate to the microarray data of the qrt-pcr detection. the expression levels of individual genes varied in different silenced lines because silencing a targeted gene possibly caused repression of other members in the pcnlp family. leaves of susceptible pepper  were inoculated with zoospores to test the virulence of each transformed line. the infection efficiencies and the average areas of lesions were shown in figure 6a and b. all pepper leaves treated with ck and sd <dig> showed large areas  of water-soaked lesions from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi; these are typical symptoms of phytophthora foliar blight . in contrast, inoculation with any of the seven silenced lines resulted in significantly smaller lesions  than those of sd <dig> and ck . inoculation with silenced lines a <dig> and s <dig> resulted in the smallest lesions  . this result is directly correlated to strongly repressed expression of four pcnlp genes in these two silenced lines . in a <dig>  expression of four genes  was very clearly reduced , and in s <dig> expression of four genes  was similarly reduced . notably, pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> were simultaneously repressed to a significant degree in a <dig> and s <dig>  in consequence, the simultaneous repression of these three genes in p. capsici resulted in significantly reduced virulence for the pathogen . otherwise, when treated with three other silenced lines , small lesions  developed on pepper leaves that were larger than those developing after inoculation with silenced lines a <dig> and s <dig> . in each of these three lines , three pcnlp genes were simultaneously silenced and showed a conspicuous reduction in expression of 50% to 60%. in a <dig>  suppression of pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> resulted in a reduction of expression by 54% to 60%. in o <dig>  silencing of pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> reduced expression by 50% to 58%. in s <dig>  suppression of pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> reduced expression by 50% to 60% . thus, the pcnlp genes in a <dig>  o <dig>  and s <dig> are not repressed as strongly as the pcnlp genes in a <dig> and s <dig>  which is possible to elucidate why these three lines resulted in slightly increased virulence compared with a <dig> and s <dig> . these results indicate that the simultaneous silencing of a few pcnlp genes in a strain of p. capsici can result in significantly reduced virulence . however, when treated with m <dig> and h <dig>  large necrotic areas  developed that were two to six times larger than those seen on pepper leaves when treated with five other silenced lines , but were at least two times smaller than those of sd <dig> and ck . in these two silenced lines there was modest reduction  in expression of two pcnlp genes. in m <dig>  the expression of pcnlp <dig> and pcnlp <dig> was reduced by 55% to 65%, and in h <dig> expression of pcnlp <dig> and pcnlp <dig> was reduced by 57% to 63%. in these two lineages, nine other genes retained high expression levels, near those of sd <dig> and ck . as the result, when only two pcnlp genes in m <dig> or h <dig> were slightly repressed, virulence of these two lines was slightly increased in comparison with five other lines . however, the expression of pcnlp <dig> was only reduced by 15% in line s <dig>  the reduced expression of pcnlp <dig> ranged 10% to 12% in two lines , and expression of pcnlp <dig> was only slightly reduced in three lines . in figure 7c, the various degrees of silencing of each targeted gene in different lines are illustrated, and the shortest of the orange cylinders indicates a greater degree of silencing for each of the targeted genes.

taken together, the above data reveal that the degree of virulence of different silenced lines is correlated with the repression of the pcnlp genes and the consequent suppression of their expression levels. the repression and expression of the targeted pcnlp genes in silenced lines was variable and showed that ectopic expression of some targeted genes with the heterologous promoter caused mrna expression levels to be several-fold lower in silenced lines than those in the controls. these results suggested that the variability in expression of pcnlp genes in the different silenced lines probably results from an eligible or ineligible position effect of the introduced dna within the p. capsici genome. in the present study, the expression of pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> was strongly repressed in more silenced lines than those of any other genes. pcnlp <dig> was significant silenced in five lines a <dig>  a <dig>  o <dig>  m <dig>  s <dig>  similar to the expression of pcnlp <dig> and pcnlp <dig>  which was strongly silenced in four lines. therefore, these three genes were effectively silenced compared to other members in the pcnlp family. in the lines a <dig> and s <dig>  moreover, pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> were highly repressed, which was parallel to the significant reduction in necrotic response after infection of leaves of pepper and tobacco. in the lines o <dig> and m <dig>  however, the suppressed genes included pcnlp <dig> and pcnlp <dig>  but the expression of pcnlp <dig> is similar to sd <dig> and ck. as a result, both o <dig> and m <dig> showed slightly increased virulence when compared to a <dig> and s <dig>  therefore, the simultaneous presence of pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> may be required for a complete necrotic response during p. capsici infection, suggesting that these three pcnlp genes might be more closely linked to the necrotic response than other members in the pcnlp family and might be crucial for virulence and necrosis-inducing activity during p. capsici infection.

discussion
since an nlp was identified in the vascular wilt fungus fusarium oxysporum <cit> , nlps have been predicted to occur in a great variety of microbes including bacteria, fungi and stramenopiles  <cit> . nlps are common and numerous in several stramenopile genomes  <cit> . we identified  <dig> nlp paralogs  from p. capsici sd <dig>  <cit> . the conserved motif ghrhdwe is always located in the central region of those pcnlps, and two cysteine residues in the n-terminal position of the pcnlp are essential for biological activity. in these respects, pcnlps are similar to those in p. megakarya, p. parasitica, p. sojae, and hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis <cit> . thus, the nlps family of effectors appear to be highly conserved across the genus phytophthora indicates that it may play an important and conserved role in all species.

to analyze the function of the pcnlp members as toxins responsible for symptom development and cell death, we evaluated the function of  <dig> pcnlp genes on active transcripts in vitro and in vivo in leaves of pepper and tobacco. we further detected the function of pcnlps protein in vitro based on the site directed mutagenesis of four amino acid residues in a conserved motif. the qrt-pcr analysis allowed for the detection and quantification of the transcriptional changes of the  <dig> pcnlp genes in a series of p. capsici-infected pepper leaves at distinct phases of the plant/pathogen interaction. five  achieved peak expression early, at three days following infection. this pattern is similar to the reported expression profiles reported of nlps in moniliophthora perniciosa and phytophthora sojae, where peak expression was associated with the appearance of disease symptoms in the initial stage of the interaction  <cit> . six  gradually increased their expression levels, peaking at a late phase of the infection. the pattern of expression has not been observed previously. as shown in figure  <dig>  the various expression patterns of different pcnlp genes in pepper tissues enable us to speculate about their contributions to differences in pathogenicity or virulence during p. capsici infection. symptomatic response to different pcnlp genes was related to variation transcription levels in vivo during infection by p. capsici. four  induced the most severe symptom development in pepper or tobacco leaves  and showed high transcription levels during infection . in contrast, six  were transcribed at low levels , which were linked to weak symptom development in both tested plants. these combined patterns have been observed previously for other hosts and their parasites. for example, the peak expression of p. sojae nlps was directly related to the occurrence of disease symptoms in infected plants as the pathogen transitioned from the biotrophic to the necrotrophic growth state  <cit> , while mgnlp of the fungal pathogen mycosphaerella graminicola appeared to be highly expressed specifically at the end of the symptomless phase of infection of wheat leaves  <cit> . the strong expression in plants of some pcnlps and their multi-copy status in the genome enabled us to answer a difficult question for this pathosystem where nlp genes exist in multiple copies, namely; are nlp genes major virulence factors for the pathogenic lifestyle of p. capsici?. in our analysis, pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> were proposed to play a crucial role in promoting virulence and inducing necrosis or cell death. other organisms have provided strong evidence for their function as virulence factors with the characterization of nlps in colletotrichum coccodes <cit>  and erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora <cit> . on the other hand, the nlp genes in pathogens such as f. oxysporum f. sp. erythroxyli and mycosphaerella graminicola do not appear to affect their virulence  <cit> , and the nlps, bcnep <dig> and bcnep <dig> are apparently not related to virulence during botrytis cinerea infection  <cit> . thus, the members of the nlp families from different pathogens encode functionally different phytotoxic proteins that appear to perform a variety of functions during infection and produce variable extended phenotypes. the reasons for this phenomenon are unclear; however, recent data suggest that the effector proteins of many pathogens including phytophthora species are under positive selection and are often considered to operate at the forefront of evolution in host-microbe interactions  <cit> . in addition, the failure to detect expression of  <dig> pcnlp genes at an early stage of infection is similar to the situation involving psojnip transcripts during the transition from biotrophy to necrotroph after infected by p. sojae <cit> . this suggests that, as in p. sojae <cit> , some pcnlps initiate the process of infection, but some other pcnlps play important roles after the initiation of infection. these results might be due to differences in regulation, but it is likely that these genes have distinct functions during infection by p. capsici unrelated to the initiation of infection.

as described above, the expression patterns of all  <dig> pcnlp genes are shown in figure 7a. similar to other phytophthora species, there are multiple copies of nlps in the genome of p. capsici and the pcnlps most likely perform different roles during the infection process. overall, we conclude that pcnlp genes not only participate in inducing cell death and symptom development but also perform different roles at different phases of infection. in addition, these  <dig> pcnlp genes are linked to symptom development in pepper and tobacco, but the intensity of the symptoms was much more conspicuous in pepper, the usual host of p. capsici, than those in tobacco . similar variation in host-dependent symptom development in relation to nlps from p. sojae and the fungus moniliophthora perniciosa has been observed  <cit> . the availability of heterologously expressed pcnlps allowed us to examine other characteristics of this protein. we were able to confirm that pcnlp genes encode chlorosis/necrosis-inducing proteins in leaves of pepper and tobacco, and that these proteins also stimulate the expression of the host’s defense-related genes in tissues of both plants. nlps have been suggested to have dual functions in plant pathogen interactions: acting both as triggers of defense responses and as toxin-like virulence factors. here, six pcnlp genes showed low transcription levels corresponding to weak symptom development, suggesting that these nlps may stimulate immunity-associated defenses or act as triggers of immune responses in plants. these findings call for additional research.

we confirmed that four conserved amino acids  in the putative active site and conserved motif have the ability to regulate the function of pcnlp <dig> . this suggests that these four conserved amino acids provide similar function in paralogs. this is in agreement with previous studies in p. aphanidermatum <cit> .

in our study, it was difficult to identify isolates in which one targeted gene was silenced alone or all targeted genes were silenced simultaneously. this phenomenon was also observed in the silencing of six hydrophobins in cladosporium fulvum <cit> . most members in the pcnlp family were not completely silenced but instead were suppressed different degrees. this may be related to the low expression levels of genes in the pcnlp family, or may be related to the difficulty of complete silencing in diploid stramenopiles. three pcnlp genes   showing high expression during p. capsici infection were more down-regulated than other tested genes showing lower expression levels, strongly supporting that highly expressed genes are easier to suppress  <cit> . several genes  were linked to a weak necrotic response in plants, but their transformants showed various degrees of reduction. however, the expression levels of the three most similar paralogs  were not significantly decreased in different transformants, but three other more divergent paralogs  were always effectively silenced in several transformants. this corresponds to the results of wroblewski et al. <cit>  in which the members of the nbs–lrr gene family showed similar patterns of silencing. in our experiments we targeted relatively large segments of the pcnlp genes . this indicates that the size of the silenced plasmid  is not limiting and that it will be feasible to assay multi-interfering constructs. it may also be feasible to interfere with several related genes with conserved domains; permitting coordinated suppression of a gene family  <cit> . in our study, necrotic lesions observed for several transformants were significantly smaller than those observed for the control strains. this suggests that individuals pcnlp may have an effect on its ability to establish infection on plant. several studies have considered the function of nlp genes, and most conclude that several nlps are indispensable for fungal infection  <cit> . our study concluded that pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> contribute greatly to the induction of necrosis during infection by p. capsici, and suggested that the simultaneous presence of pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> may be required for a complete necrotic response.

our results suggest that some pcnlps play important roles in necrosis-inducing or pathogenicity during p. capsici infection. however, many aspects of phytophthora pathogenicity remain obscure, and investigating the action of specific genes in the infection process has always been an arduous undertaking. however, elucidating the important role of pathogenicity genes in p. capsici will help advance understanding of the biology and pathogenicity of phytophthora and other stramenopiles on diverse host plant species.

we found that each targeted pcnlp gene affects cells or tissues differently depending upon the stage of infection. most pcnlp genes could trigger necrotic or chlorotic responses when expressed in the host c. annuum and the non-host n. benthamiana. moreover, our results showed that individual pcnlp genes have different phytotoxic effects, but pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> may play important roles in symptom development and may be crucial for virulence, necrosis-inducing activity, or cell death during infection by p. capsici.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that each targeted pcnlp gene affects cells or tissues differently depending upon the stage of infection after inoculation with zoospore suspension of highly virulent p. capsici sd <dig> using qrt-pcr. most pcnlp genes could trigger necrotic or chlorotic responses when expressed in the host c. annuum  and the non-host n. benthamiana after agroinfiltration the host cells of both plants with a. tumefaciens pvx vector carrying each of the pcnlp genes on evaluation of the necrotic response and the pcnlp proteins expression levels in the lesions of both plants. otherwise, we obtained seven putative pcnlp silenced lines that was initially expected to contain a trigger gene, however, each of the silenced lines contained several silenced genes, and different silenced genes were assigned to the different silenced lines. on the evolution of the virulence of different silenced lines and the mrna expression levels of different pcnlp genes, pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig> and pcnlp <dig> may be required for a complete necrotic response during p. capsici infection. therefore, our results showed that individual pcnlp genes have different phytotoxic effects, but pcnlp <dig>  pcnlp <dig>  and pcnlp <dig> may play important roles in symptom development and may be crucial for virulence, necrosis-inducing activity, or cell death during infection by p. capsici.
