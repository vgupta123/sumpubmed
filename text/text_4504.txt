BACKGROUND
cells use several mechanisms to ameliorate the effects of transient changes in the environmental conditions such as heat stress, irradiation, viral infections, etc. for instance, cells have developed a complex family of genes coding for protein-folding machines sharing a wide range of vital functions to buffer the effects of stress on the proteome integrity. these proteins, also called heat-shock proteins or molecular chaperones, are classified in different protein families named on the basis of their members' approximate molecular weight and they assist in the folding, trafficking and degradation of proteins  <cit> . the heat-shock protein groel is among the best-studied molecular chaperones in bacteria and belongs to the group i chaperonins. group i chaperonins are a group of ring-shaped atpases that assist de novo protein folding in most cellular compartments  <cit> . groel is a homotetradecamer that interacts with a ring-shaped cofactor named groes, which participates in folding proteins into the correct three-dimensional conformation  <cit> , and both proteins are essential for escherichia coli growth at all range temperatures  <cit> .

due to the important functional role played by groel in maintaining the proteome integrity of cells, groel has become the target of many microbiological studies aimed at uncovering molecules involved in the epidemiology of pathogenic bacteria. groel from pathogenic bacteria is a highly immunoadjuvant protein and is recognised by the toll-like receptors as part of the innate defence system  <cit> . the fact that groel is among the most conserved protein families  <cit>  and that groel isolated from pathogenic bacteria has been reported to have a strong immune eliciting function  <cit>  has inspired projects aimed at developing vaccines targeting groel from pathogens. these studies yielded insightful results implicating groel in bacterial disease pathogenesis such as those caused by chlamydiae infections  <cit> . groel in chlamydiae trachomatis  has been implicated in chronic inflammatory processes caused by chlamydiae infections leading to tissue damage and scarring  <cit> . interestingly, groel in chlamydiae became duplicated at the origin of the chlamydiae lineage presenting three distinct molecular chaperones, namely the original protein groel <dig> , and its paralogous proteins groel <dig>  and groel <dig>   <cit> . even though the three chlamydiae groel proteins present substantial amino acid sequence conservation in important regions involved in polypeptide binding when compared to groel from the bacterium escherichia coli, significant differences have been spotted in groes binding regions and at regions involved in atp binding and hydrolysis. among the three groel genes, only the expression levels of groel <dig> and its cochaperone groes increase under heat-stress conditions and only the protein groel <dig> complements the function of a groel thermo-sensitive mutation in hela cells under heat-stress conditions  <cit> . further, a previous report identified differences in the expression levels between the three groel genes during the developmental stages of c. trachomatis  <cit> . this study also showed through in vitro models of c. trachomatis infection that the three different groel genes are differentially and independently expressed during the different infection cycles of this pathogen, with groel <dig> being highly expressed during the infectious cycle of chlamydiae and groel <dig> showing the highest expression among the three groel genes during the persistent infections  <cit> .

despite previous efforts invested in unravelling the main functional differences between the three different groel genes in chlamydiae, results have brought more questions than they have answered regarding the reasons for this functional divergence. to date, apart from one study in  <dig> conducting some computational analyses for these genes  <cit> , no detailed bioinformatics approach has been performed to aid in understanding the evolutionary dynamic differences between the three groel genes and to link these differences with functional data.

in this study we conduct state-of-the-art bioinformatics analyses to unravel the main selective constraints leading to the functional differentiation between the chlamydiae groel genes. to identify functional divergence between the different groel protein copies we test the selective constraints after groel gene duplication, analyze and phylogenetically map amino acid sites involved in this functional divergence and conduct molecular coevolution analyses within groel proteins and between these and proteins known to be obligate e. coli groel protein clients. the effects of amino acid sites involved in functional divergence in the stability of groel protein structures are also discussed.

RESULTS
groel proteins have diverged functionally in chlamydiae after gene duplication
to test functional divergence between groel proteins after gene duplication we applied the program diverge version  <dig>  . diverge tests for the presence of functional divergence of two types, functional divergence type i and type ii. functional divergence type i is detected when sites conserved  in one of the phylogenetic clusters  are significantly variable in the other related phylogenetic cluster. in other words, functional divergence type i indicates strong selective  constraints at that site  in one of the clusters and relaxed constraints  in the paralogous cluster. functional divergence type ii is detected when, after gene duplication mutations leading to different amino acids become fixed in both resulting paralogous proteins and these mutations remain conserved after speciation in each cluster. this pattern indicates that amino acid sites diverged functionally between both paralogous clades  but they were equally important for the protein's function . we were interested in testing functional divergence type i to detect loss or acquisition of functional roles in particular amino acid sites in one of the groel group paralogs.

we subjected the multiple sequence alignments including the three groel protein paralogs to phylogenetic analyses and used the resulting phylogeny as an initial tree for the functional divergence test. in all the comparisons performed, the hypothesis of functional divergence provided significantly better log-likelihood values than the null hypothesis that assumes no functional divergence. in fact, groel <dig> showed functional divergence type i when compared to groel <dig>  and groel <dig> . interestingly, the parameter of functional divergence as well as the lrt was more significant when comparing groel <dig> to groel <dig> than in the case of the comparison of groel <dig> to groel <dig> . groel <dig> showed moderate functional divergence from groel <dig> and stronger divergence from groel <dig> than from groel <dig> . comparison of groel <dig> to the cluster formed by groel <dig> and groel <dig> also yielded significant results .

a the coefficient of functional divergence type i calculated by maximum likelihood.

b the shape parameter of the gamma distribution of substitution rates among sites.

c the likelihood ratio test to compare the likelihood of the hypothesis indicating no functional divergence to the hypothesis assuming functional divergence. lrt has been approached to a χ <dig> distribution with  <dig> degree of freedom.

functional divergence data is therefore in agreement with the expression divergence shown in previous functional/expression analysis demonstrating that in fact the different groel gene copies are differently and independently expressed over time post-infection during chlamydiae infection, and that groel <dig> is the most abundant protein at all time points assessed during the developmental cycle  <cit> . in their study however, groel <dig> was virtually absent during persistent infections and groel <dig> showed the highest expression levels at that stage  <cit> . our results also support, in addition to the differential expression of the different groel genes, the divergence in the protein function between the three chlamydiae groel proteins.

the difference in the magnitude of functional divergence between groel proteins can also be quantified by the identification of sites responsible for such functional divergence after each duplication event . examination of the distribution of sites under functional divergence  when we compared groel <dig> to groel <dig> only yielded three amino acid positions under functional divergence using the posterior probability  threshold of pp=  <dig> . these sites were i <dig>  a <dig> and e <dig> . the homologous site of a <dig> in e. coli  is located in a region involved in binding protein substrates  <cit> . in addition, e <dig> is the homologous position to a <dig> in e. coli, closely located to charged residues exposed to the central cavity in the cis groel ring, probably in contact with substrates  <cit> . these sites were conserved in groel <dig> but became variable in groel <dig>  suggesting a loss of functional role in groel <dig> at these sites. comparison of groel <dig> to the cluster formed by the paralogs groel <dig> and groel <dig> identified as sites significantly responsible for functional divergence type i i <dig>  a <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> . apart from the obvious functional role of a <dig>  s <dig> is the homologous position of g <dig> in e. coli and physically proximal to e. coli 478– <dig> possition involved in atp binding and hydrolysis  <cit> . once again, these positions are highly conserved in groel <dig> and very variable in the cluster formed by the paralogs groel <dig> and groel <dig> 

comparison of groel <dig> to groel <dig> and groel <dig> to groel <dig> showed a great percentage of sites under functional divergence type i with threshold posterior probability values of pp =  <dig>  and pp =  <dig>  . the number of sites detected was greater in the comparison of groel <dig> to groel <dig> than in groel <dig> to groel <dig> comparison. we also studied the pattern of functional divergence and found three different profiles represented by the amino acid sites under functional divergence. the first pattern presented sites conserved for groel <dig> and groel <dig> but variable for groel <dig>  and was represented by  <dig> % of the functionally divergent sites. the second pattern was that represented by sites  that were variable in groel <dig> and groel <dig> and became conserved in groel <dig> . finally we also found sites  variable in groel <dig> that became conserved in groel <dig> and groel <dig> . in most of the cases hence, groel <dig> presented loss of functional constraints in some sites and gain of constraints in others and these results were more obvious for groel <dig> than for groel <dig> compared to groel <dig>  examination of the sites under functional constraints in groel <dig> provided evidence supporting the involvement of these sites in atp binding , substrate and groes binding   <cit>  and interaction and folding of protein clients in the groel central cavity   <cit> . these results suggest that functional divergence might have affected the interaction mainly between groel <dig> and its protein clients and to a lesser extent between groel <dig> and groel protein clients.

we also examined the effect that mutations between the different groel protein copies have on the protein structure. we modeled three-dimensional structures for groel <dig>  groel <dig> and groel <dig> by homology to escherichia coli groel protein using the program 3d-jigsaw  <cit> . we then compared these structures using the root mean square deviation  of the different atoms calculated as:

here, we are comparing the mean distance between amino acids a and b belonging to proteins a and b respectively by comparing their coordinates in the three space axes. this comparison did not detect any significant structural differences among the three groel proteins or between them and e. coli groel protein . results then suggest that amino acid replacements did not involve structural changes but rather may have induced functional shifts between groel protein copies.

although no major structural changes seem to be related to sites under functional constraints we examined whether sites with varying degrees of selective constraints in the different groel copies show differences in the folding energy of the local groel structures. the performance of different methods to analyze local folding energies has been recently elegantly examined  <cit> . in their work, rastogi et al., tested the accuracy of different models to predict the most stable structure or folding for four sets of proteins, globin-like, sh <dig> domain, sh <dig> domain and flavodoxin-like proteins. we used this methodology to look at folding-energy related differences at those sites under different functional constraints when comparing groel copies  and estimated the significance of these differences. we calculated this significance by comparing our folding-energy results with a distribution of folding energies for a  <dig> randomly generated set of peptides sharing the same length and composition as the local fold of our proteins. we did the analyses using scripts and programs kindly provided by the group of prof. liberles. our comparisons showed no significant differences in those sites under functional divergence when comparing the different mutant versions of the protein at those sites. in conclusion hence the mutations under varying functional constraints between groel copies lineages did not show significant variability in the local folding energies . although apparently negative, the examination of the effects of mutations on protein structures is anything but straightforward. the reason is that two main factors have to be considered in such analyses. first, structures and folds are very flexible to mutations  <cit>  and slight changes on function do not have to imply significant changes on protein-structure or folding. second, the effect of several mutations on the protein structure may interact, with single mutations having little effect while combined mutations having large effects on the stability of local protein folds. more research is needed to identify the real effects of mutations on protein folds and structures.

differential coevolution among chlamydiae groel proteins
functional divergence analyses detect divergence of two proteins at particular sites and evolutionary time points but do not provide a measure of the amount of decoupled evolution between the proteins after gene duplication. for example, functional divergence may have occurred between two proteins at particular sites without affecting the remaining protein sequence. in our particular case, we would not expect greater coevolution of groel <dig> with groel <dig> than with groel <dig> when averaging the coevolution parameter throughout the multiple sequence alignment. to quantify how much each of the groel paralogs has diverged not only functionally at particular sites but also in their evolutionary paths from groel <dig>  we applied mutual information based coevolution analyses  between groel <dig> and groel <dig> and groel <dig> and groel <dig>  analysis of coevolution between pairs of groel proteins highlighted an interesting pattern that was coincident with the results of functional divergence among these proteins. we used the mutual information criterion  value as a measure of the amount of coevolution . to compare the coevolution of groel <dig> vs groel <dig> to groel <dig> vs groel <dig>  we divided mic values into  <dig> categories ranging between  <dig> < mic >  <dig>  with intervals of  <dig> , estimated the proportion of sites within each category in the two sets of analyses and compared these proportions between the two coevolutionary analyses . groel <dig> showed a greater mean mic coevolution value  with groel <dig> compared to groel <dig>  in fact, most of the sites from groel <dig> coevolving with groel <dig> presented very low mic values, indicating poor coevolution . in contrast, groel <dig> presented very high mic values compared to groel <dig>  indicating stronger coevolution with groel <dig> . in addition, most of the mic values were above  <dig>  suggesting strong coevolution. these values are in the range of mic values obtained in previous studies examining the coevolution between amino acid sites involved in the interaction between proteins  <cit> . these results indicate together with the functional divergence analysis that in fact the three groel proteins have functionally diverged. they also indicate that groel <dig> evolved independently of groel <dig> to a certain extent but that groel <dig> show significant and more pronounced independent evolution from groel <dig> than groel <dig> does. this points to the fact that groel <dig> and especially groel <dig> may have probably evolved toward performing different regulatory mechanisms as previously suggested  <cit> . their differential coevolution is also supported by data based on the analysis of the promoter regions of groel <dig>  groel <dig> and groel <dig> that show that groel <dig> and groel <dig> promoter regions in serovar d of c. trachomatis lack circe  region as well as the putative σ <dig> promoter element  <cit> .

to further examine the selection shifts between the three groel protein copies we also investigated the intra-groel molecular coevolution and identified the differences in the coevolutionary relationships between amino acid sites among the three groel copies. comparison of the coevolutionary relationships in groel <dig> to those in groel <dig> showed that while many coevolutionary relationships have been conserved in both copies  other relationships have been lost in groel <dig> . both groups of amino acid coevolving pairs include amino acid sites involved in the interaction with protein clients in the groel complex cavity. interestingly, the level of coevolution between the set of pairs unique to groel <dig>  was lower than the level of coevolution for the set of pairs of sites conserved in both proteins groel <dig> and groel <dig> , indicating conservation of the main coevolutionary relationships, which are probably those highly involved in interaction with protein clients. most interesting is the fact that groel <dig> showed no conservation of any of the intra-molecular amino acid site pairs coevolutionary relationships when compared to groel <dig> or groel <dig>  thus pinpointing its unique evolutionary divergence and probable functional divergence from the other groel copies.

in addition, all of the groel <dig> and groel <dig> copies are expressed as previously shown and their non-synonymous-to-synonymous nucleotide substitutions rates ratio  indicate they are performing a distinct physiological function but that all of the groel gene copies are functionally important since they are subjected to strong selective constraints . these relaxed selective constraints may have occurred during the first stages after gene duplication.

to investigate the difference in regulatory roles between the groel protein copies, we tested the strength of coevolution using the same approach as above but now between each groel protein copy and a set of client proteins shown to depend upon groel to acquire their productive functional conformation in e. coli. this analysis has the advantage of being relative in its interpretation because protein clients examined here are known to require groel to acquire productive folding and are therefore groel protein clients in the different bacteria examined here  <cit> . we were not interested in the range of new clients emerging after groel gene duplication but rather in the variation of coevolution between each groel protein copy and the known protein clients. this test can shed some light on the question of whether functional divergence also meant divergence in the interaction patterns with each one of the different client proteins. if that was the case then we would expect that the groel protein copy that is more functionally divergent from the ancestral groel should show lower mean mic values when tested against each protein set, indicating lower mean coevolution with these groel protein clients. indeed, the percentage of sites from protein clients presenting high mic values  of coevolution was greater when they were tested in protein-protein coevolution analyses against groel <dig>  than against groel <dig> and was higher against groel <dig> than groel <dig>  coinciding with our functional divergence analyses . the difference was also significant, with groel <dig> presenting an average of  <dig>  times stronger coevolution with the protein clients than groel <dig>  and groel <dig> presenting  <dig>  times stronger coevolution with groel clients than groel <dig> . results hence support functional divergence between groel protein copies. because of the divergence in the different coevolutionary strengths of groel protein paralogs and their protein clients, results also suggest that this functional divergence may have been followed by the divergence in the groel proteins regulatory and protein interaction networks.

recurrent adaptive evolution after groel gene duplication
here we conducted tests to further demonstrate the adaptive fixation of amino acid replacements in the groel protein copies after gene duplication. the rationale behind this analysis is that because of the various stages in chlamydiae infections  we hypothesize that the different groel protein copies are performing distinct functions, as their expression levels are different. we have also shown in this study that the groel copies are functionally divergent and that this divergence can be related to the specific ability of the different groel proteins to interact with the sets of proteins known to require the assistance of e. coli groel protein to acquire their productive conformation. analysis of the sequences using the maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony based approaches  yielded very similar results that pointed to the adaptive evolution of amino acid replacements in the branches of the tree leading to groel <dig> and groel <dig> . in the case of maximum-likelihood based analysis implemented in the program paml, the model assuming different ω values for the different branches of the tree  was significantly better than the goldman and yang model  that assumes one ω value for the entire phylogeny . the frm only highlighted four branches to be under adaptive evolution , including the two leading to groel <dig> and groel <dig>  and those leading to each one of the groups to the exclusion of parachlamydia species  . the parsimony based procedure implemented in the program swapsc also gave similar results indicating adaptive evolution after gene duplication in the branches separating parachlamydia and chlamydiae species and in that branch leading to groel <dig>  but not in that leading to groel <dig>  on average, the ω values taken from swapsc and paml results for the branches under adaptive evolution ranged between  in the branch leading to groel <dig>   in the branch leading to groel <dig>  and  and  after the separation between parachlamydia and chlamydiae species in groel <dig> and groel <dig> groups, respectively. due to the high values of ω in the branch leading to groel <dig> group, we examined the ds values to determine whether these ω values were inflated due to low ds values estimates in paml. detailed examination of the dn and ds values in this branch showed that the high ω values were indeed the result of ds values being close to zero rather than to real increase in the fixation rate of amino acid replacements throughout the evolution of this group. we therefore could not conclude if groel <dig> was undoubtedly under adaptive evolution after the duplication leading to groel <dig> and groel <dig>  adopting a conservative view, groel <dig> was the protein showing the greatest amount of adaptive evolution, being coincident with the fact that this protein showed the greatest amount of functional divergence and decoupled evolution from groel <dig> 

examination of sites under adaptive evolution with significant posterior probabilities  identified sites involved in substrate binding and sites located in the central cavity of groel ring pointing toward the cavity and very probably involved in interaction with groel protein clients . taking all the results from the functional divergence analyses, protein-protein coevolution analyses and the adaptive evolution in each paralog group, we identified regions in the groel <dig> paralogs, groel <dig> and groel <dig>  involved in interaction with proteins that have undergone changes in their selective constraints after gene duplication . these results suggest that groel gene duplication in chlamydiae may have been followed by the groel paralogs' functional divergence toward acquiring different regulatory roles and establishing different protein-protein interaction network geometries.

whether the functional divergence between the duplicated groel proteins meant the acquisition of completely novel functions or the subfunctionalization of the proteins copies is unclear. placing our results into a model that supports subfunctionalization or into one that proposes neofunctionalization as the fate for gene copies after duplication requires taking into account population genetics parameters  <cit> . in principle, duplicated genes are lost more slowly in organisms with small effective population sizes than in those with large population sizes. the reason is that selection against harmful mutations is weaker in population with small sizes and disadvantageous mutations can drift to fixation. gene copies resulting from gene duplication have hence more evolutionary time  to accumulate advantageous mutations and survive despite the build up of harmful mutations. because degenerative mutations greatly outnumber beneficial mutations the probability of neofunctionalization in small populations is rare whereas subfunctionalization is more likely to occur in these populations  <cit> .

the effective population sizes of prokaryotes are considered large enough as to preclude any opportunity for subfunctionalization. however in unicellular pathogenic organisms, such as the chlamydiae species analyzed in this work, their genetic effective population sizes may be greatly dependent on their multicellular hosts, which present significantly lower population sizes. in such a scenario, the genetic drift effect increases and selective constraints strength decreases, incrementing thus the probability of gene copy preservation and subfunctionalization after gene duplication. groel protein in chlamydiae may be a striking example of such process taken to completion at the interactome level.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that groel protein copies in chlamydiae species have diverged functionally after the gene duplication events. our comprehensive bioinformatics analysis yields results that are in accordance with previously published experimental and functional data and provides further support to the divergence in the physiological and regulatory roles of the different groel protein copies. we also provide evidence that groel <dig>  is more divergent from groel <dig>  than groel <dig>  and that this divergence was due to the fixation of amino acid replacements that modified the functional constraints in specific amino acid sites in groel <dig>  coevolution analyses performed here also support the high divergence of groel <dig> and provide further evidence that the three different groel copies have different interaction patterns with previously identified groel <dig> protein clients, further supporting their different regulatory roles. finally, analysis of selective constraints supports the adaptive fixation of amino acid replacements after gene duplication mainly leading to groel <dig> and that this fixation affected functional sites involved in interaction with protein clients. based on these analyses and conclusions we propose conducting comprehensive protein-protein interaction analyses between the different groel protein copies in chlamydiae and the known groel protein clients to fully understand their functional and regulatory divergence and their role in the epidemiology, developmental and persistent stages of chlamydiae infections.
