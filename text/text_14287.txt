BACKGROUND
ste11p encodes a mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase  that activates conserved mapk pathways controlling mating, high osmolarity glycerol , invasive growth and the fks <dig> gene in the cell wall integrity pathway  <cit> . the catalytic domain of ste11p is most homologous to mammalian mekk <dig>  <cit> . during mating, high osmolarity growth and invasive growth, ste11p is phosphorylated and activated by ste20p, a p <dig> activated kinase that binds to cdc42p. once activated, ste11p has the potential to phosphorylate and activate two mapkks, either ste7p for mating and invasive growth pathways, or pbs2p for the high osmolarity sensing pathway  <cit> . the activation of ste7p leads to activation of fus3p and kss1p mapks that activate shared and unique transcription factors among other substrates  <cit> . pbs2p activates hog1p mapk, which also activates transcription factors and other substrates  <cit> .

prior work suggests that ste11p mapkkk signals through mapk kss1p to positively regulate cell wall integrity  <cit> . this analysis revealed that ste11p has functional redundancy with the bck1p mapkkk in the pkc pathway and can activate the expression of the fks <dig> gene  <cit> . fks <dig> encodes a stress induced beta- <dig>  glucan synthase subunit similar to constitutively expressed fks <dig> that is important for cell wall integrity under conditions of cell wall stress  <cit> . the fks1p and fks2p subunits of glucan synthase are major therapeutic targets of anti-fungal inhibitors and acquire resistance mutations during fungal infections in people  <cit> . fks <dig> is expressed at low levels and is upregulated under conditions of stress, higher temperature, when fks <dig> is mutated, reduced carbon source  <cit> , and when glycosylation is disrupted  <cit> .

the calcineurin and protein kinase c and mating pathways are the major signaling pathways that regulate fks <dig> expression and cell wall integrity. calcineurin  is activated by increases in intracellular calcium by influx of extracellular calcium through a mid1/cch1-ca2+ channel  <cit> . many of its responses are mediated through the transcription factor crz1p. calcineurin dephosphorylates crz1p/tcn1p, leading to nuclear localization that activates many genes  <cit> . during conditions of high extracellular calcium or pheromone, the calcineurin pathway signals crz1p/tcn1p to bind the fks <dig> promoter at a calcineurin-dependent response element  site within residues - <dig> to - <dig>  <cit> . during polarized growth, cell wall damage or temperature stress, the cell wall integrity pathway plasma membrane sensors signal through rho1p to pkc1p, which activates bck1p mapkkk to activate mkk1/2p mapkk, which signals slt2p/mpk1p mapk and mlp1p pseudokinase to activate several transcription factors. slt2p/mpk1p, its human homolog erk5p, and mlp1p activate fks <dig> through the cell cycle transcription factor sbf  at a scb consensus site at - <dig> to - <dig>  <cit> . there are three potential ste <dig> tgaaaca binding sites starting at - <dig> to - <dig>  but ste <dig> has not been found to bind the fks <dig> promoter in two independent chip studies. mating pheromone induces fks <dig> at late times  <cit> , supporting the possibility that it is due to secondary events including activation of the calcineurin and pkc pathways from calcium influx and polarized growth.

one gene that is induced by crz1p is cmk <dig>  which encodes one of two redundant calmodulin dependent kinases, possibly an orthologue of human cam kinase ii  <cit> . cmk2p prevents death of calcineurin-deficient cells under conditions of low calcium  <cit> . a genomic in vitro screen for kinase substrates suggests that cmk2p could be a direct substrate of ste11p  <cit> , ptk2p was the only other kinase substrate of ste11p identified  <cit> . ptk2p is a putative serine/threonine protein kinase involved in regulation of plasma membrane atpase, spermine and spermidine transport  <cit>  and stimulates slt2p/mpk1p phosphorylation  <cit> . cmk2p is predicted to be phosphorylated by three different mapk pathway kinases, pbs2p, fus3p and slt2p/mpk1p, and ptk2p is predicted to be phosporylated by one of these three, pbs2p , raising the possibility of cross regulation and functional redundancy.

here we analyze how ste11p regulates the fks <dig> gene. our results suggest that active ste11p that is uncoupled from upstream control crosstalk to fks <dig> through all four known possible kinase targets; through the hog pathway mapkk , cmk2p, and ptk2p in addition to ste7p mapkk and stimulates the fks <dig> gene independently of ste12p. these findings reveal new functional links between ste11p downstream targets to calcineurin and pkc pathways and illustrate a high level of signaling flexibility.

RESULTS
ste11p is required for basal slt2p/mpk1p activation
prior work indicated that ste11p is functionally redundant with the bck1p mapkkk for cell integrity during vegetative growth and could basally activate the cell wall integrity target fks <dig> gene using a well established fks2-lacz reporter gene  <cit> . to test the possibility that ste11p regulates cell integrity through activation of the pkc pathway during vegetative growth, we assessed the basal level of active mpk1p in three yeast strain backgrounds, s288c, w303a and ∑1278b by probing whole cell extracts with a mammalian phospho-p42p <dig> antibody that cross-reacts with s. cerevisiae slt2p/mpk1p  <cit> . we compared the level of active slt2p/mpk1p in exponentially dividing cells . the level and gel mobility of basal active slt2p/mpk1p varied tremendously. w303a and s288c had an equivalently sized short form of slt2p/mpk1p, whereas ∑1278b had a longer form. w303a had the highest basal level of active slt2p/mpk1p, whereas s288c had the lowest basal level, indicating variability at the level of pathway flux.

the basal level of active slt2p/mpk1p was clearly reduced in a ste11Δ, mutant . less obvious partial reductions in the level of active slt2p/mpk1p were detected in ste4Δ, ste5Δ, ste50Δ, fus3Δ, kss1Δ, and ste5Δ fus3Δ strains . these observations suggested that ste11p had a more critical role in regulating the pkc pathway than other mating pathway components.

ste11- <dig> activates the fks <dig> promoter through - <dig> to - <dig> and - <dig> to -540
the fks <dig> promoter is complex with multiple promoter elements that include the calcineurin-dependent response element , swi4/swi <dig> sbf element, glucose repression elements and potential pheromone response elements  <cit> . we examined how ste11p regulates the fks <dig> gene by comparing the ability of hyperactive ste11- <dig> to stimulate established fks2-lacz promoter truncations of the promoter: fks2-lacz , fks2cyc1-lacz  <cit> , fks2cyc1-lacz  <cit>  and fks2cyc1-lacz . the fks <dig> - <dig> to + <dig> promoter has an sbf site at - <dig> cacgaaa- <dig> that binds a swi4/swi6/mpk <dig> complex , the cdre  within - <dig> to - <dig> , a glucose repression element overlapping two putative mig1p repressor consensus sites at - <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> , and one of three ste12p consensus binding sites, tgaaaca . consistent with prior work  <cit> , ste11- <dig> activated both fks <dig> -cyc1-lacz and -cyc1-lacz in 1x synthetic medium containing 2% dextrose and lacking uracil  is plgΔ- <dig> pcyc1-lacz). ste11- <dig> also activated the fks2cyc1-lacz promoter that contains the sbf recognition site that is positively regulated by mpk1p/slt2p and mlp <dig> . ste11- <dig> activation was three-fold greater on the fks <dig> - <dig> to + <dig> promoter than on - <dig> to + <dig>  consistent with the presence of a putative ste12p binding site and the cdre element. ste11- <dig> failed to stimulate the fks2-lacz reporter that contains the sbf consensus site  that is regulated by swi4p/swi6p/mpk1p/mlp1p complexes and stimulated by temperature stress and congo red  <cit> . the absence of stimulation of the sbf site is consistent with ste11- <dig> and mating pheromone-induced inhibition of cdc <dig> cyclin dependent kinase  <cit> . thus, under our growth conditions, ste11-4p positively regulated fks <dig> reporter genes through at least two promoter elements, from - <dig> to - <dig> containing a crz1p binding site, two potential mig <dig> binding sites and  <dig> potential ste12p binding site, and another element between - <dig> and - <dig>  but did not stimulate transcription through the mpk1p/mpl1p responsive sbf site within - <dig> to - <dig> 

ste11- <dig>  α factor, and ste <dig> differentially regulate fks2-lacz
mating pheromone stimulates fks <dig> gene expression at late times, with optimal expression occurring  <dig> minutes after α factor addition in yepd medium  <cit>  and less obvious induction in synthetic medium  <cit> . α factor induction of genomic fks <dig> mrna is blocked by fk <dig>  <cit>  and a crz1Δ/tcn1Δ mutation  <cit> . we compared the ability of α factor to stimulate fks2-lacz and fks2-lacz and two ste12-dependent reporter genes fus1-lacz and prm5-lacz. in a wild type ste <dig> background, α factor addition caused only a modest 2-fold increase in expression of the fks <dig> -lacz reporter and no effect on the fks <dig> -lacz reporter. much larger increases occurred for prm5-lacz  and fus1-lacz  reporter genes that harbor multiple ste12p consensus binding sites . in wild type, far1Δ, and the ste11- <dig> far1Δ background , α factor caused little increase in fks <dig> -lacz levels . the far1Δ strain , had lowest basal levels of fks2-lacz and blocked α factor . this contrasted up to > <dig> fold increases in fus1-lacz and prm5-lacz .

by comparison, α factor stimulated the pdm <dig> fks2-lacz approximately 4-fold in a different wild type background  <cit> . thus, regulation of reporter genes with - <dig> and - <dig> cut offs was relatively independent of α factor, consistent with only one ste12p tgaaaca site very close to the 5'end of the - <dig> fks2-lacz constructs near the cdre.

the absence of a strong α factor effect suggested that ste12p might not be required for ste11- <dig> activation of fks <dig>  to determine whether the ste12p transcription factor was required for ste11p activation of fks <dig>  we tested the effect of a ste12Δ mutation in ste11- <dig> far1Δ strains treated or not with α factor compared with that in no ste12Δ mutation strains . the ste12Δ null mutation blocked the ability of ste11- <dig> to activate both the fks <dig> -lacz and fks <dig> -lacz reporter genes similar to the blocks that occurred for prm5-lacz and fus1-lacz reporter genes. the effect was similar to that seen for α factor. thus, ste12p is critically important for ste11- <dig> to activate the fks2-lacz reporter genes, but its function is likely indirect.

ste <dig> stimulates the expression of fks <dig> -lacz but not fks <dig> -lacz
a ste12Δ mutation blocks the expression of pheromone response pathway genes that lead to activation of ste11p, ste7p and fus3p and kss1p mapks. over expression of ste12p can bypass positive and negative control by fus3p and kss1p mapks. we examined whether a gal1prom-ste <dig> gene would increase the expression of the fks <dig> reporter genes in the absence of calcineurin and mating pathway components. cells were shifted from dextrose medium to raffinose medium and finally to galactose medium to induce expression of gal1prom-ste <dig> . fks <dig> gene expression is derepressed in poor carbon sources including raffinose and galactose, most likely through snf1p kinase inhibition of mig1p, which may bind consensus sites at - <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> .

ste12p stimulated the expression of fks <dig> -lacz >5-fold in wild type, ste11Δ, fus3Δ kss1Δ and far1Δ strains, but not if the strain lacked the cnb <dig> regulatory subunit of calcineurin . in sharp contrast, gal1p-ste <dig> did not activate the expression of fks <dig> -lacz to a great extent , although ste11- <dig> was able to stimulate . thus, ste12p activated the fks2-lacz promoter by a mechanism involving the calcineurin pathway, suggesting it may mimic the late onset of activation by mating pheromone that leads to an increase in calcium influx that activates the calcineurin pathway cdre element. in contrast, ste11-4p activated the fks <dig> promoter through the cdre element as well as a second element within - <dig> to + <dig> 

ste11Δnp activates the fks <dig> promoter from - <dig> to + <dig> through pbs2p and ste7p
it was unlikely that the block in expression of the - <dig> and - <dig> fks2-lacz constructs in the ste11- <dig> ste12Δ far1Δ strain was the result of a direct effect of ste12p on fks <dig> expression. however, the activity of ste11-4p requires proteins that are regulated by ste12p, such as ste5p; for example, a dominant active ste5hyp <dig> gene also increased the level of active mpk <dig> in anti-active mapk westerns . to bypass dependence on upstream regulators of ste11p, we used a ste11Δn allele  that lacks the n-terminal regulatory domain that represses the catalytic kinase domain and also binds ste5p scaffold, ste50p and sho1p  <cit> . the ste11Δn mutation largely, but not completely, bypasses a requirement for ste20p phosphorylation to be active. ste11Δnp activates kss1p and more weakly activates fus3p due to the absence of ste5p binding to link ste7p to fus3p  <cit> , but can activate pbs2p mapkk down to hog1p efficiently  <cit> .

we tested dependence on pbs2p and ste7p mapkks that are activated by ste11p. strikingly, in a pbs2Δ strain, basal fks <dig> -lacz expression decreased and remained greatly decreased in the presence of ste11Δn compared to the wild type strain. in contrast, a ste7Δ mutation had little effect on pgal-ste11Δn induced expression of fks <dig> -lacz. however, the level of fks <dig> -lacz was lower in a ste7Δ pbs2Δ double mutant than in a pbs2Δ single mutant , revealing contribution from ste7p. thus, ste11Δnp regulates the fks <dig> promoter gene through pbs2p and ste7p, but pbs2p is more crucial.

fus3p activated fks <dig> -lacz expression whereas kss1p inhibited
we tested whether ste11p required fus3p and kss1p mapk targets of ste7p, to stimulate fks <dig> . fus3p and kss1p have many targets including ste12p and its repressors rst1p/dig1p and rst2p/dig2p. in a fus3Δ strain, the basal level of the fks <dig> -lacz reporter gene decreased to the same degree as in a ste12Δ strain. fus3p was required for ste11Δn to activate fks <dig> -lacz expression; the block in the fus3Δ strain was similar to that of the ste12Δ mutant. in contrast, the kss1Δ mutation caused a modest decrease in expression on its own and, conversely, restored expression in the fus3Δ mutant background . therefore, fus3p and ste12p activated fks <dig> -lacz whereas kss1p had more inhibitory effect than positive.

ste11Δnp activated the fks <dig> gene via pbs2p in the absence of kss1p and fus3p or ste7p. a pbs2Δ mutation reduced the level of ste11Δn activation of the fks <dig> -lacz reporter gene in a kss1Δ fus3Δ strain similar to in a ste7Δ . therefore, ste11Δnp regulates the fks2-lacz gene through both ste7p mapkk and pbs2p mapkk, with pbs2p signaling being more significant and ste7p positive signaling being dependent on fus3p, kss1p and ste12p.

ste11Δnp activates fks <dig> -lacz through pbs2p and fus3p and kss1p, whereas ste7p blocks signaling by pbs2p
ste11Δn was strictly dependent on pbs2p and fus3p/kss1p to stimulate the fks <dig> gene in the absence of the cdre element. all three single deletions, pbs2Δ, fus3Δ and kss1Δ, decreased fks2-lacz expression with nearly complete blocks occurring with pbs2Δ and fus3Δ . in sharp contrast, ste7p had primarily negative function in regulating the fks <dig> -lacz reporter gene, with 3-fold increase in lacz level occurring in the ste7Δ strain compared to wild type . the increased signaling in the absence of ste7p was primarily dependent on pbs2p, and on fus3p/kss1p -lacz for pbs2Δ ste7Δ is equivalent to ste12Δ and wild type strains, whereas the pbs2Δ fus3Δ kss1Δ strain is even lower). thus, we can define two separable branches of control that are inhibited by ste7p, one through pbs2p and another through fus3p and kss1p. loss of ste7p may increase the ability of ste11Δnp to signal through pbs2p and may also confer catalytically inactive functions to fus3p and kss1p.

the relative contributions of ste7p to ste11Δnp stimulation of the fks2-lacz and fks2-lacz reporters suggested ste11p/ste7p's major positive regulatory function was within the - <dig> to - <dig> region that responds to pheromone and its major negative regulatory function was between - <dig> to + <dig>  the analysis with ste11- <dig>  suggested a target region between - <dig> to - <dig> rather than the - <dig> cacgaaa- <dig> site that binds the sbf-mpk <dig> complex  <cit> .

ste11Δnp exhibits little dependence on bni1p and ste20p
bni1p and ste20p are required for mating morphogenesis and pheromone activation of the pkc pathway and filamentation induced by kss1p  <cit> . in both bni1Δ and ste20Δ strains, the basal level of the fks <dig>  reporter gene was the same as wild type strain and the level induced by ste11Δnp was reduced by ~25% compared to the wild type control . bni1p and ste20p were required for full activation of fks <dig> by ste11Δnp, but their contribution was much less than that of ste7p, fus3p, kss1p and pbs2p. there was no difference in expression of fks <dig>  reporter gene for wild type, ste20Δ and bni1Δ strains with ste11Δn . thus, the ste11Δn mutation largely bypasses a dependence on morphogenesis and filament formation to induce the fks <dig> reporter genes.

ste11Δnp activated the fks <dig> promoter from - <dig> to + <dig> through cell wall integrity and calcineurin pathways
we determined whether ste11Δnp required the calcineurin and cell wall integrity pathways to stimulate fks2-lacz and fks2-lacz genes. prior work demonstrated functional redundancy between bck1p and ste11p . in the course of this analysis, we found that a bck1Δ strain transformed with the ste11Δn plasmid grew much better than bck1Δ cells without ste11Δn, based on faster and greater density of growth in streak outs on sc selective plates . this result supports functional redundancy between bck1p and ste11p  <cit>  being mediated by targets of ste11Δnp.

the calcineurin pathway was required for ste11Δnp to induce expression of the fks <dig> -lacz reporter gene, as lacz induction was blocked by mutations in calcineurin cnb1Δ and the target transcription factor crz1Δ . bck1p was also required for ste11Δnp to activate the fks <dig>  reporter gene, as was mpk1p . the mpk1Δ mutation reduced expression somewhat less than the bck1Δ mutation, presumably due to mlp <dig> functional redundancy  <cit> . the addition of an osmotic support, kcl, had no effect on the ability of ste11Δnp to support better growth or induce expression of the fks <dig> -lacz reporter gene, ruling out a trivial explanation of cell lysis for reduced expression in the bck1Δ strain or a block in signaling through the hog pathway.

ste11Δn-induced expression of fks <dig> -lacz and prm5-lacz was also dependent upon both cnb1p/crz1p and bck1p/slt2p/mpk1p pathways , even though the fks2-lacz reporter lacks the calcineurin-dependent response element. the dependence on bck1p and slt2p/mpk1p was as expected for both fks <dig> -lacz and prm5-lacz  <cit>  whereas dependence on cnb1p/crz1p was unanticipated and revealed additional cross-regulation.

ste11Δnp activated fks <dig>  and fks <dig> through cmk2p and ptk2p
we tested whether the two potential ste11p substrates cmk2p and ptk2p  <cit>  were required for ste11Δn to activate fks2-lacz reporter genes. loss of cmk2p blocked the ability of ste11Δn to activate the fks <dig>  reporter gene to a greater extent than crz1Δ or cnb1Δ mutations . a cnb1Δ cmk2Δ double mutant was as equivalently blocked as a cmk2Δ single mutant. thus, cmk2p is important for ste11Δnp activation of fks <dig> -lacz.

similar results were found for the fks <dig> -lacz reporter gene, except in this instance the inhibitory effects of the cmk2Δ, cnb1Δ and crz1Δ single mutations were more similar to each other . cmk2p and cnb1p provided additive functions based on a greater block in cmk2Δ cnb1Δ double mutant than either single mutant. moreover, dependence on cmk2p and ptk2p was also apparent using the prm5-lacz reporter gene that senses the pkc pathway . cmk2p was more critical than cnb1p and clearly provided additive functions with cnb1p as the introduction of a cmk2Δ mutation abolished residual signaling in the cnb1Δ strain. therefore, cmk2p was essential for ste11Δnp to signal to calcineurin and pkc pathway reporter genes.

the galactose-induced pgal1-ste11Δn gene had a ~2-fold stimulatory effect on a fks2-lacz reporter gene that includes the calcineurin cdre and the mig1p glucose repression element in wild type  and fus3Δ  backgrounds . this fold-effect was similar to that of α factor on the  construct. a cnb1Δ cmk2Δ double mutation reduced basal expression of fks2-lacz 3-fold and completely blocked ste11-4-induced expression, confirming that expression required the calcineurin cdre . the larger fold-increases with fks2-lacz and fks2-lacz  supports the likelihood that ste11p regulates a fks <dig> promoter region that lies within - <dig> to - <dig> .

remarkably, ptk2p was also required for ste11Δnp to induce fks <dig> -lacz and fks <dig> -lacz , and provided nearly as significant positive control as cmk2p. ptk2p and cmk2p did not provide additive functions, based on no greater block in a cmk2Δ ptk2Δ double mutant than either single mutant . the level of expression in the cmk2Δ ptk2Δ double mutant was similar to the ptk2Δ single mutant, which was greater than the cmk2Δ single mutant . ste11Δnp induced fks <dig> -lacz expression in the cmk2Δ ptk2Δ strain to a greater degree than in the cmk2Δ single mutant suggesting ptk2p provides both positive and negative control . the cmk2Δ and ptk2Δ mutations each completely blocked ste11Δnp induction of the fks <dig> -lacz reporter that lacks the calcineurin cdre . therefore, cmk2p and ptk2p are both required for ste11Δnp to signal to calcineurin and pkc pathway reporter genes, but cmk2p plays a greater role than ptk2p.

ste11Δn increased prm <dig> mrna and fks <dig> mrna
we tested whether ste11Δnp increased fks <dig> and prm <dig> mrnas in wild type and cnb1Δ strains. the mrna levels for fks <dig>  prm <dig>  pmc <dig> and act <dig> were assessed by cdna synthesis and real-time pcr using act <dig> as a normalization control. fks <dig> mrna increased in the presence of ste11Δn, but a much larger increase was detected for prm <dig>  and no increase was detected for pmc <dig> mrna . the effect on fks <dig> mrna was less than what we detected with the fks2-lacz reporter and may reflect posttranscriptional effects or the fact that the promoter is complex with multiple signaling elements less easily distinguished than by using the reporter genes. a cnb1Δ mutation decreased the level of fks <dig> and prm <dig> mrnas as expected but had no effect on basal mrna of pmc <dig>  ste11Δnp still increased fks <dig> and prm <dig> mrnas in the cnb1Δ mutant, consistent with a calcineurin-independent pathway that could involve the pkc pathway.

ste11Δnp increased the abundance of cmk2p
the observation that ste11Δnp activation was blocked in cmk2Δ strains  supported the possibility that cmk2p might be an in vivo substrate of ste11p  <cit> . to look for a posttranslational effect of ste11p on cmk2p, we determined whether ste11Δnp influenced the mobility of cmk2p in a native polyacrylamide gel mobility experiment. triple and double gfp tags were inserted at the carboxyl-terminal end of cmk <dig> which were confirmed by pcr  and western blotting . immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts revealed that the abundance of cmk2p was greater in cells that express ste11Δnp . this finding was consistent with an effect of ste11p on the cmk <dig> promoter that is controlled by crz1p and a posttranscriptional effect on the level of cmk2p that could arise from feedback stimulation of its own expression  <cit> . a comparison of the mobility of cmk2-3xgfp and cmk2-2xgfp in wild type and ste11Δnp cells also suggested a faster mobility in the presence of ste11Δnp, which would be consistent with a posttranslational modification . these data were consistent with the possibility that ste11p regulated cmk2p directly.

ste11Δnp activated cmk2-lacz through cmk2p
the calcium signal is transmitted to both cnb1p and cmk2p, but only cnb1p appears to activate crz1p  <cit> . calcium activation of a cmk2-lacz reporter is blocked by a crz1Δ cmk2Δ double mutation but not by a cmk2Δ single mutation, indicating that crz1p activates the cmk2-lacz gene independently of cmk2p  <cit> . to test for an effect of ste11Δnp on the cmk <dig> promoter that might be mediated through its effects on cmk2p protein, we measured cmk2-lacz expression in wild type and cmk2Δ strains. the cmk2-lacz reporter is stimulated by  <dig> mm cacl <dig> in the medium in a crz1- and fk506-dependent manner  <cit> . basal and ste11Δnp induction of cmk2-lacz were blocked by cnb1Δ and crz1Δ single mutations . strikingly, cmk2p was also required for ste11Δnp to activate the cmk2-lacz reporter gene, suggesting feedback control. the cmk2Δ mutation caused a large block in ste11Δnp induction of cmk2-lacz expression compared with the wild type cmk <dig> strain. ste7p and ste12p were also required for ste11Δnp to efficiently activate the cmk <dig> promoter as was ptk2p . therefore, ste11Δnp uses multi-pathway crosstalk to regulate the cmk <dig> promoter. the strict dependence on cmk2p suggests ste11p activates the level or activity of cmk2p protein, which then activates the cmk <dig> promoter through positive feedback.

ste11Δnp activated morphogenesis in cmk2Δ strain
ste11p and its known targets ste7p and pbs2p positively regulate morphogenesis. to determine whether cmk2p had a role in morphogenesis, we counted the number of polarized and nonpolarized cells that were enlarged in wild type and cmk2Δ cells with and without ste11Δnp. interestingly, in the cmk2Δ strain lacking ste11Δnp, only  <dig> % cells displayed an enlarged morphology compared to  <dig> % of wild type cells grown in yepd medium . these findings supported a role for cmk2p in the control of morphogenesis. as expected, wild type cells expressing ste11Δnp grew bigger than control. in the cmk2Δ strain, fewer cells enlarged with ste11Δnp. however, ste11Δnp was still able to induce cell enlargement in the cmk2Δ strain. collectively, these findings revealed that cmk2p was important for morphogenesis and that ste11Δnp retained a strong ability to activate morphogenesis independent of cmk2p, presumably through activation of one or more downstream targets .

ste11Δnp also required pbs2p, ste7p and cmk2p to activate a prm <dig> reporter gene
to confirm the validity of our findings with fks <dig>  we examined the effects of mutations on prm <dig>  a second gene that senses both pkc pathway and mating pathway inputs . ste11Δnp induction of expression of the prm5-lacz reporter gene was blocked by fus3Δ kss1Δ and ste12Δ mutations, but not by fus3Δ and kss1Δ single mutations  as expected. in contrast, ste7Δ and pbs2Δ single mutations had no effect but ste11Δnp was blocked by the ste7Δpbs2Δ double mutation . thus, pbs2p and ste7p are both equivalently required for ste11Δnp to signal to prm5-lacz, a second pkc pathway reporter gene.

among the various calcineurin pathway mutant strains examined, the cmk2Δ mutation caused the biggest block in ste11Δnp activation of prm5-lacz. a strong block occurred with a crz1Δ mutation, but only a partial decreased occurred for cnb1Δ and ptk2Δ mutations. the overall pattern of effects was similar to the fks <dig>  reporter gene, with ptk2p being required for cmk2p to regulate the prm5-lacz reporter . the pattern of effects of mutations in cmk <dig>  ptk <dig>  cnb <dig> and crz <dig> resembled that found for fks <dig> -lacz reporter, which primarily senses the pkc pathway. collectively, these findings supported ste11p crosstalk of the pkc pathway as observed with the fks2-lacz gene and dependence on pbs2p, ste7p, cmk2p and ptk2p.

slt2p/mpk1p blocked ste11Δnp activation of the pmc1-lacz reporter gene
since ste11p crosstalked with downstream targets of the calcineurin pathway, we also tested pmc1-lacz, another reporter gene of this pathway whose expression is stimulated by ca2+  <cit> . when mutant strains were treated with ca2+, pmc1-lacz expression increased as reported . however, ste11Δnp did not significantly increase pmc1-lacz expression . instead, we found unexpectedly that ste11Δnp increased the level of pmc1-lacz expression 5-fold in a strain lacking mpk1p mapk . this interesting result revealed that slt2p/mpk1p normally suppresses ste11Δnp activation of pmc1-lacz expression. we examined the level of pmc <dig> mrna by rt-qpcr and found that expression of ste11Δnp decreased pmc <dig> mrna levels in both wild type and cnb1Δ strains , which would be consistent with the ability of ste11Δnp to increase the level of active slt2p/mpk1p. thus, slt2p/mpk1p may prevent ste11p cross-regulation of the calcineurin pathway and feedback inhibit at some step upon activation by ste11p.

the activation of the calcineurin, cell wall integrity and high osmolarity pathways in s. cerevisiae and other fungi is important for cell survival and response to cell wall damage and other stimuli including calcium influx, polarized growth, hypo-osmolarity, pheromone, heat shock and perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . fks <dig> is important for survival under stress conditions linked to the calcinerin and pkc pathways  <cit> . prior analysis had suggested a potential link between mating pathway activation and the calcineurin and cell wall integrity pathways, but the means by which this signaling occurs was not fully understood  <cit> . we discovered that ste11Δnp crosstalks with cell wall integrity and calcineurin pathways through pbs2p mapkk, and two putative kinase targets cmk2p and ptk2p, with separable contribution from ste7p mapkk, fus3p and kss1p mapks. support for the relevance of our findings is the logical pattern of effects of mutations in the genes encoding these protein kinases, and in calcineurin and cell wall integrity components . moreover, similar patterns of control were found for other physiologically relevant promoters, including prm <dig> and cmk <dig>  additional support comes from the observation that the activation of fks <dig> reporter genes by ste11p did not require upstream activators or ste20p or bni1p-mediated morphogenesis, and the finding that activation of mpk1p kinase  was more dependent on ste11p than it was on mating pathway components such as ste5p and ste2p.

the data hint at the existence of a distinct promoter element within the fks <dig>  promoter region that is regulated by ste11p, but not by ste12p. ste11- <dig> did not activate a fks2-lacz reporter that strictly overlaps the mpk1p regulated sbf element , but could stimulate fks2-lacz and mpk1p kinase activity. the ste11p-inducible promoter element operates independently of ste12p, because ste12p could not activate fks2-lacz although it could activate fks2-lacz with the cdre. collectively, these observations suggest the ste11p- inducible element overlaps the - <dig> to - <dig> region.

multiple lines of evidence support a functional link between ste11p and cmk2p and the calcineurin pathway . while support for direct physical interaction between cmk2p and ste11p comes from the prior in vitro analysis  <cit> , there has been no functional connection between these protein kinases. four lines of evidence support cmk2p being positively regulated by ste11p. first, the effect of ste11Δnp on fks <dig> expression was almost blocked without cmk2p; ste11Δnp was functionally dependent on cmk2p. second, the cmk2Δ mutation caused a larger effect block of ste11Δnp stimulation of prm <dig> expression that senses the pkc pathway than crz <dig> and cnb <dig> mutations , supporting the likelihood that cmk2p is a substrate of ste11Δnp. third, there is a hint of a shift in the mobility of cmk2-gfp when ste11Δnp is expressed , supporting the possibility of posttranslational modification by phosphorylation. fourth, ste11Δnp clearly increased the abundance of cmk2-gfp  and increased the expression of cmk2-lacz in a manner dependent on cmk2p , consistent with the possibility of greater cmk2p activity. these observations support direct positive control of cmk2p by ste11p phosphorylation, although more work is needed.

in vitro analysis suggests cmk2p may be a target of phosphorylation by a number of kinases including ste11p, fus3p and pbs2p and a central node in cellular control  <cit> . cmk2p was the substrate of ste11p, pbs2p, fus3p, cka1p, kns1p, pho85p, pho85-pcll <dig>  slt2p/mpk1p, pkh2p, tpk2p, tpk3p, ygl059w and yol128c. thus, the effects of fus3Δ and pbs2Δ mutations on expression of the various reporter genes in our study may be partly due to loss of regulation of cmk2p by fus3p and pbs2p. the expression levels of fks <dig> -lacz and fks <dig> -lacz reporter genes were equivalently reduced to the same degree by the pbs2Δ or fus3Δ mutations. it is curious that a ste7Δ mutation had little effect since ste7p activates fus3p. however, ste7p contribution could be detected in the ste7Δ pbs2Δ double mutant strain with ste11Δnp; fks <dig> expression was 3-fold lower than in pbs2Δ or fus3Δ single mutant strains. perhaps without its regulatory domain, ste11p preferentially phosphorylates pbs2p over ste7p; this could provide an explanation for the lesser effect in a ste7Δ strain. an alternative explanation is that loss of ste7p leads to an increase in ste11Δnp pathway flux through pbs2p. in fission yeast, cmk2p is phosphorylated in response to oxidative stress  <cit> , supporting the possibility that ste11p regulates cmk2p in part through pbs2p. further work is needed to understand how cmk2p and ptk2p regulate thea fks <dig> gene. ptacek et al.,  <dig> identified  <dig> in vitro substrates for cmk2p and  <dig> for ptk2p  <cit> . remarkably, four of these substrates overlap, supporting functional redundancy between cmk2p and ptk2p.

our analysis reveals a possible feedback loop whereby cmk2p activates its own expression through calcineurin . cmk2-lacz expression was also partially dependent on ste7p and ste12p. because ste12p is a transcription factor, there are multiple genes through which it could regulate cmk2-lacz. however, one gene could be fus <dig>  since fus3p is both activated by ste7p and may directly regulate cmk2p  <cit> . the multi-pathway crosstalk through the cmk <dig> promoter that requires cmk2p could reflect a cooperative activity of one or more transcription factors. potential shared physical linkages between cmk2p, calmodulin and calcineurin , raises the possibility of a direct link between cmk2p and calcineurin signaling to crz1p.

an unexpected interesting observation was that slt2p/mpk1p inhibits the ability of ste11p to regulate a calcineurin pathway gene, pmc <dig>  in the w303a background, pmc <dig> expression could be activated in ca2+ medium , but there was only modest activation by ste11Δnp . however, an mpk1Δ mutation liberated ste11Δnp to increase pmc <dig> expression, even though it greatly decreased basal expression of pmc <dig> . therefore, slt2p/mpk1p inhibited ste11Δnp activation of pmc <dig> expression. one hypothesis is that slt2p/mpk1p may inhibit certain proteins in the calcineurin pathway that influence ste11p function. one possible link is cmk2p, which is also a putative in vitro target of slt2p/mpk1p  <cit> . further analysis is required to understand how slt2p/mpk1p selectively blocks the ability of ste11p to activate pmc1-lacz and why this level of control is the reverse of what was detected for the fks <dig> and prm <dig> reporter genes that also sense calcineurin pathway and cell wall integrity pathways.

our analysis suggests that in s. cerevisiae, there is much fluidity in pathway crosstalk between mapk pathways. it was quite surprising to find that all possible ste11p kinase targets were required for the full effect of ste11Δnp on activating various reporter genes. these findings suggest significant compensation and redundancy at the level of control and support functional relationships among the many targets of ste11p.

the study also reveals that a transcription factor  can strongly regulate the expression of a gene through indirect means. prior chip studies failed to find evidence of ste12p binding to fks <dig>  <cit>  and α factor induction of fks <dig> mrna is completely blocked by fk <dig> and crz1Δ  <cit> . it has been suggested that mating pheromone stimulates the fks <dig> gene indirectly through effects on calcium influx  <cit> . however, multiple pathways are activated by α factor mating pheromone and ste12p has the capacity to bind to multiple transcription factors to regulate distinct pathways. ste12p and ste11Δnp stimulated fks2-lacz reporter harboring the cdre plus one of three ste12p consensus tgaaaca sites , but stimulation was largely blocked by a calcineurin regulatory subunit cnb1Δ mutation. thus, ste12p is critically important for activation of fks <dig>  but its function is indirect within the promoter region examined in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
our results lead us to several conclusions:  ste11p crosstalks with calcineurin and cell wall integrity pathways independently of the mating pathway.  ste11p crosstalks through all known or potential downstream kinase targets, ste7p, pbs2p, cmk2p and ptk2p, to regulate calcineurin and pkc pathway reporter genes, fks <dig>  prm <dig>  and cmk <dig>   cmk2p is likely to be a direct substrate of ste11p in the calcineurin pathway in vivo based on functional dependence,  ste11p increases the abundance of cmk2p in part through a positive effect on the cmk <dig> gene promoter which is dependent on cmk2p. an additional unexpected observation is that slt2p/mpk1p may prevent ste11p from stimulating pmc <dig> expression, which could arise through ste11p activation of slt2p/mpk1p. a summary of these observations is shown in figure  <dig>  ste12p is important but its role is indirect.
