BACKGROUND
the conservation of large scale genomic sequences across two or more genomes --synteny blocks-- is of primary interest because their identification sets up a stage for identifying and characterizing sequence and functional differences among genomes  <cit> . the term synteny has been used in different contexts in the past. originally, synteny was used to indicate the colocalization of different genes in corresponding chromosomes of different species   <cit> . recently, with the availability of thousands of sequenced genomes, synteny has been used to describe the conservation of co-localized genes in the same order within different genomes . in some occasions, the term "conserved synteny" has been used to refer a genomic region in which the chromosomal location of multiple markers is conserved, but not necessarily their precise order  <cit> . the term "synteny block"  <cit>  has been defined previously as a segment in one genome that can be converted, through genome rearrangements, into a conserved segment in another genome. as such, a synteny block does not necessarily represent areas of perfectly continuous similarity between genomes. in this paper, we use the term "perfect synteny block" as "a genomic region of perfectly conserved gene content, order and strandedness", as defined by coghlan and wolfe  <cit> . as an extension to this definition, we use "imperfect synteny block" as "a genomic region containing some level of interruption, and in which order and strandedness is not necessarily conserved"  <cit> .

in the past decade, different methods have been proposed to identify synteny blocks  <cit> . however, these methods usually lack one or more of the following functionalities required for detailed analysis:  comparing more than two genomes,  allowing interruptions within synteny blocks;  capturing the strandedness of genes; and  addressing one-to-many orthologous relationships. failure to provide these functionalities makes these programs inapplicable for the identification of genome rearrangement events such as inversions, insertions, reciprocal translocations and segmental duplications. to tackle these problems, we have recently developed a new method called orthocluster, a computer program for the systematic detection of synteny blocks between two or among multiple genomes  <cit> . briefly, orthocluster takes as input genetic markers  and their relationships  and scans through two or more genomes for synteny blocks. orthocluster distinguishes genetic markers as either in-map or out-map. a genetic marker in one genome is called in-map if it has orthologous genetic markers in all corresponding genomes. in contrast, a genetic marker in one genome is called out-map if it does not have orthologous genetic markers in corresponding genomes.

to facilitate the application of orthocluster, we have recently developed a web server called orthoclusterdb  <cit> . additionally, a book chapter describing its usage and application has been published  <cit> . in addition to its use in identifying synteny blocks, orthocluster can be applied to identify segmental duplications within a genome  <cit> .

c. elegans is a free living soil-dwelling hermaphrodite nematode and a popular model organism for biomedical studies because of its small size, transparent body, short life cycle, ease of propagation and compact genome. c. elegans was also the first multicellular organism subject to whole genome sequencing  <cit> , and the genome sequence of this species has been declared to be complete, with no remaining gaps in  <dig>  after more than a decade of annotation after its first publication, the genome of c. elegans is arguably the best annotated of a multicellular organism to date  <cit> . the sequencing of its sister species caenorhabditis briggsae, also a hermaphrodite, sets up an excellent platform for comparative genomic analysis  <cit> . recently, by applying orthocluster, we have identified segmental duplications in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans genome, including a large duplication that is polymorphic among c. elegans laboratory n <dig> strains  <cit> . in this project, we applied orthocluster to identify synteny blocks between c. elegans and its sister species caenorhabditis briggsae, whose genome was sequenced a few years ago  <cit> .

synteny block identification and characterization is critical for understanding genome structure and functional domains of genomes. synteny between c. elegans and c. briggsae was first explored when the first sequenced reads of c. briggsae became available. using their program waba   <cit> , kent and colleagues compared the whole genome sequence of c. elegans and  <dig> mb of c. briggsae sequences  and found that 59% of these genomes are homologous at the base level, while 41% of the genome sequences are found in nonalignable regions. using these alignments, they estimated the synteny relationship between c. elegans and c. briggsae and found that ~40% of the genome is resistant to rearrangements. later, using a gene-based approach, coghlan and colleagues examined the slightly larger set of sequences  for synteny blocks and genome rearrangement events  <cit>  and found many perfect synteny blocks. they also identified larger imperfect synteny blocks between these two genomes with an average size of  <dig> kb. the completion of the c. briggsae genome sequencing project enabled the c. briggsae genome analysis group to compare c. elegans and c. briggsae at the whole genome scale at the supercontig level  <cit> . to identify regions of colinearity, the program waba  <cit>  was used to produce base level alignments, followed by merging of adjacent blocks and bridging of small transpositions and inversions. eventually,  <dig>  alignments were obtained that cover  <dig> % of the c. elegans genome, with a median length of  <dig>  kb   <cit> . the average size is smaller than that obtained using gene-based analysis reported previously  <cit> . recently, a chromosomal-level assembly of the c. briggsae genome  <cit>  has been constructed, which can be utilized to facilitate synteny identification and analysis. here, taking advantage of this new assembly and our newly developed program orthocluster, we revisit and reanalyze synteny blocks between these two genomes.

RESULTS
initial comparison between c. elegans and c. briggsae genomes
using the c. elegans genome annotation in wormbase release ws <dig>  <cit> , the genome assembly and annotation of c. briggsae  <cit>  , and the correspondence file generated using inparanoid  <cit> , we detected  <dig>  perfect synteny blocks between the genomes of c. elegans and c. briggsae using orthocluster. these blocks range in size from  <dig> to  <dig> genes . examination of these synteny blocks, including the gene models contained within these blocks, immediately suggests that many gene models  are defective, which leads to the unnecessary truncation of large synteny blocks. one example of such case is shown in figure  <dig>  which illustrates two genomic regions in c. elegans and c. briggsae that are nearly perfectly conserved with the exception of one gene in c. elegans, b <dig> , which breaks the synteny. based on the current wormbase annotation , this gene does not have a clear ortholog in c. briggsae. examination of the alignment of genes b <dig>  and b <dig>  in c. elegans and gene cbg <dig> in c. briggsae  suggests that the predicted c. briggsae gene is defective. indeed, the current gene model of cbg <dig> can be split into two separate genes, one orthologous to b <dig>  and the other orthologous to b <dig> . experimental validation based on pcr reactions that prove the existence of the two genes and the non-existence of the junction on a cdna library for c. elegans suggests that these are two separate genes . fixing cases like this will uncover many more bona fide orthologous relationships between c. elegans and c. briggsae.

synteny-based gene model correction and ortholog assignment
we developed a procedure  in order to detect and correct defective gene models at the whole genome scale. altogether, we identified  <dig> putative new genes in c. elegans . in contrast, in c. briggsae, we have generated  <dig> revised gene models,  <dig> of which correspond to novel gene structures in previously defined intronic or intergenic regions . most deletions and additions were due to gene splits and gene merges . we assigned new orthologous relationships based on sequence similarity revealed by the improved gene annotation and synteny, which leads to the assignment of  <dig> new orthologous relationships .

genome-wide identification and analysis of synteny blocks
orthologous relationships
based on the improved orthologous relationships , the majority of the orthologous relationships between c. elegans and c. briggsae are one-to-one relationships , with only  <dig> % of the c. elegans genes with orthologous relationships  having more than one ortholog in c. briggsae, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> orthologs. likewise,  <dig> % of the c. briggsae genes with orthologous relationships  have more than one ortholog in c. elegans, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> orthologs. one-to-one orthologous relationships exist mainly between homologous chromosomes of c. elegans and c. briggsae , demonstrating strong chromosomal synteny, in good agreement with previous studies  <cit> .

numbers in parenthesis represent relationships found in the "_random" assembly of the chromosome, as reported by hillier and colleagues  <cit> .

perfect synteny blocks
using orthocluster and the improved genome annotations, we identified  <dig>  perfect synteny blocks . of these blocks,  <dig>  are non-nested, whereas  <dig> are nested within larger synteny blocks. a nested synteny block corresponds to a subset of genes within a larger synteny block that is found duplicated in different genomic regions in either the same or different chromosomes. the largest perfect synteny block between the genomes of c. elegans and c. briggsae contains  <dig> genes  and spans a  <dig>  kb genomic segment in chromosome v of c. elegans, corresponding to a  <dig>  kb segment in chromosome v of c. briggsae . the mean size of these perfect synteny blocks span  <dig>  kb, while the median size is  <dig>  kb. altogether, the perfect synteny blocks cover  <dig>  genes in c. elegans  and  <dig>  genes in c. briggsae  . genome-wide view of synteny blocks can be generated using orthoclusterdb  <cit>  . most  of the synteny blocks in c. briggsae are conserved within the homologous c. elegans chromosome thus showing strong chromosomal synteny . among the  <dig> synteny blocks  in c. elegans that are mapped to a non-homologous chromosome in c. briggsae,  <dig> % are located in chromosomes ii, iv and v of c. elegans and  <dig> % are located in chromosomes i, iv and v of c. briggsae.

numbers in parenthesis correspond to the number of synteny blocks found in the "_random" assembly of the chromosome, as reported by hillier and colleagues  <cit> .

perfect synteny blocks of different sizes are not evenly distributed in all chromosomes. our results indicate that perfect synteny blocks on chromosome x are significantly larger than those on the autosomal ones. the median length of perfect blocks within autosomal chromosomes is  <dig>  kb , whereas the median length of these type of blocks within chromosome x is  <dig>  kb , more than two-folds larger . this observation is consistent with previously reported observations  <cit> , suggesting that chromosome x is subject to fewer rearrangement events. alternatively, most rearrangements occurring in chromosome x are lethal and are therefore not preserved in evolution. taking the definition of clusters and arms provided by hillier and colleagues, we find that, within autosomes, the median length of perfect synteny blocks in autosomal centers is  <dig>  kb , whereas the median length of perfect synteny blocks in autosomal arms is  <dig>  kb . this difference is not statistically significant . among all six chromosomes, the one with the highest genomic coverage is chromosome x . chromosome v, which is the largest chromosome in c. elegans, also contains the largest number of blocks .

species-specific gene family expansions/contractions were observed previously and many gene family members have been found to form tandem clusters in c. elegans and c. briggsae  <cit> , which is consistent to our recent observation that the c. elegans genome harbors a large number of intrachromosomal duplications, many of which occur in tandem  <cit> . in this project, we have demonstrated that members of a same gene family can form tandem clusters within synteny blocks identified using orthocluster. we found  <dig> such cases, in which  <dig> contain more genes in c. elegans while  <dig> have more genes in c. briggsae within these tandem gene clusters. one example of this is a syntenic region that has a higher presence of members of the gst  family of genes in c. elegans than in c. briggsae . further exploration of these regions is required to unveil the mechanisms underlying the expansion/contraction of these genes.

our gene model improvement has greatly enhanced our ability to identify larger synteny blocks. when we use the ws <dig> annotation  for the detection of perfect synteny blocks, we found more  but smaller blocks  compared to those described above. for example, the largest synteny block contains  <dig> genes using the improved annotation, but only  <dig> genes if we use the ws <dig> annotation. in fact, the  <dig> genes are a subset of the synteny block composed of  <dig> genes detected using the improved annotation. compared to the ws <dig> annotation, the improved annotations increase the coverage of the chromosomes .

contribution of operons to perfect synteny blocks
according to wormbase annotation , there are  <dig>  operons in c. elegans, ranging in size from two to eight genes . previous comparative studies have concluded that these operons are highly conserved between c. elegans and its sister species c. briggsae, with the vast majority of the operons  conserved between these two species. what is the contribution of operons to the perfect synteny blocks identified between these two species? in order to address this question, we have examined the contribution of operons to perfectly conserved synteny blocks . our analysis suggests that operons constitute an insignificant part of the perfect synteny blocks.

first, the portion of the c. elegans genome covered by the  <dig>  annotated operons  is dramatically smaller than that covered by the  <dig>  perfect synteny blocks identified in this study . more recent studies have shown that operons are not as conserved as previously reported and that there is a greater turnover of operon composition among caenorhabditis species  <cit> , suggesting that the contribution of operons to the perfect synteny blocks between c. elegans and c. briggsae is even lower.

second, if we define an operonic synteny block as a perfect synteny block with at least half of its genes being conserved operons, we find  <dig> such operonic synteny blocks . these operonic syntenic blocks contain  <dig> operons . these  <dig> operonic synteny blocks cover only  <dig> % of the c. elegans genome, still much smaller than the  <dig> % of the c. elegans genome covered by all perfect synteny blocks.

third, the limited contribution of operons to the observed synteny is further illustrated by the low coverage of the x chromosome by operons  in c. elegans, which is the chromosome that is most covered by perfect synteny blocks  between c. elegans and c. briggsae .

imperfect synteny blocks
during evolution, genome sequences are often interrupted by small genome rearrangement events such as insertions, deletions, inversions and duplications. it has been suggested that small inversions and transpositions can be regarded as noise in genome rearrangements  <cit> . identification of imperfect synteny blocks is valuable because they provide a global view of the existing synteny between different species for regions that have been subject to various types of rearrangement events. to detect such synteny blocks, we ran orthocluster by allowing mismatches  as well as by relaxing the constraints of order and strandedness of the genes within the blocks. in general, relaxing the constraints regarding gene order, strandedness and mismatches generates larger and fewer synteny blocks when compared to the perfect synteny blocks. in contrast to relaxing the number of mismatches, relaxing the constraints of order and strandedness within blocks alone has only a weak impact on block size distribution, suggesting that insertions/deletions and long-range transposition events are much more common than inversion and short-range transposition events. one example of a larger synteny block found when relaxing only order and strandedness constraints is one with  <dig> genes in chromosome iii of the c. elegans genome . this synteny block was split into two smaller ones when orthocluster was applied for detecting perfect synteny blocks. these two blocks, one of size  <dig> and the other  <dig>  are separated by one in-map gene  whose ortholog  is inverted with respect to the neighboring genes, hence disrupting the perfect conservation of strandedness.

allowing either in-map or out-map mismatches leads to the identification of larger synteny blocks because neighboring perfect synteny blocks start to merge. for example, using the improved annotation, when the percentage of both the in-map and the out-map mismatches are set to 5%, the largest block contains  <dig> genes  , compared to  <dig> genes identified as the largest block when no mismatches are allowed . when these mismatch percentages are increased to 10% and 20%, the largest block contains  <dig> genes  and  <dig> genes , respectively. when we ran orthocluster by allowing a maximum of 50% in-map mismatch and 50% out-map mismatch within each synteny block, we found  <dig> % of the genomic sequence of c. elegans being syntenic to  <dig> % of the c. briggsae genomic sequence. as illustrated in figure 6c, allowing more mismatches leads to merging of unrelated blocks because the genomic coverage increases sharply for mismatch percentages above this point. also, for values larger than 50%, the number of synteny blocks decreases dramatically, mostly due the inclusion of in-map mismatches from unrelated regions of the genome . at this setting, the median length of the synteny blocks found with this set of parameters is  <dig>  kb  . again, the imperfect synteny blocks are not evenly distributed in the genomes. the mean size of imperfect synteny blocks is  <dig>  kb  for autosomal synteny blocks, while  <dig>  kb  for chromosome x. this extremely large mean for the x chromosome compared to its median reflects that the size distribution of synteny blocks in the x chromosome is positively skewed . within autosomes, again we don't observe a significant difference between centers and arms , with the median length of autosomal centers being  <dig>  kb , whereas the median length of autosomal arms is  <dig>  kb . this is in agreement with a previous report  <cit> . the largest synteny block spans  <dig>  mb on chromosome x of c. elegans, between  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb. altogether, there are  <dig> synteny blocks that are larger than  <dig> mb between these two genomes. they are distributed across all chromosomes of c. elegans except chromosome i and iii. these  <dig> largest synteny blocks add up to  <dig> mb. these large synteny blocks are unlikely to be found by chance under a random breakage model, even after correcting for multiple testing   <cit> . there are altogether  <dig> synteny blocks that are larger than  <dig> kb, which add up to  <dig> mb in size, strongly suggesting that c. elegans and c. briggsae genomes share large synteny blocks. as shown in figure  <dig>  synteny blocks identified here are significantly larger that those identified using an alignment-based approach  <cit> .

discussion
in this work we applied our newly developed tool, orthocluster, for the detection of synteny blocks between the genome of c. elegans and the newly reconstructed c. briggsae genome. this anchor-based program has a number of features that makes it useful for identifying synteny blocks. in addition to identifying mismatches within syntenic regions, it takes into consideration one-to-many orthologous relationships at the moment of identifying synteny blocks. it is also sensitive to gene strandedness. more importantly, orthocluster works with multiple genomes so that users can explore synteny among the expanding number of sequenced genomes. now that the genomes of three additional caenorhabditis species  have been sequenced, we are eager to apply orthocluster to identify and analyze synteny relationships among these genomes. the appropriate handling of these types of features enables users to detect genome rearrangement events such as insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions, and reciprocal translocations. furthermore, orthocluster can be used for the detection of segmental duplications within a single genome  <cit> . since orthocluster is an anchor-based program, correct annotation of the genetic markers coordinates used as anchors is an essential condition for the accurate estimation of synteny. taken together, orthocluster is a flexible tool for the detection of synteny blocks among species of different evolutionary distance.

we have demonstrated that syntenic information is useful for the improvement of defective gene models and detection of potential new genes and missing orthologous relationships. in this attempt, we have identified  <dig> new gene models  in c. briggsae and  <dig> candidate new gene models in c. elegans. these improved annotations enabled us to identify  <dig> new orthologous relationships. some of the new gene models that we have identified were independently detected by wormbase curators. for example, gene c10a <dig>  was absent in wormbase release ws <dig>  but was later curated and released in ws <dig>  this gene was detected also with our procedure .

the improved genome annotations and orthologous relationships have helped the synteny block analysis since larger synteny blocks are found in contrast to those obtained with ws <dig> annotations . also, some conserved operon structures are restored with the improved annotations . this methodology will be applied for improving the annotation of the newly sequenced genomes of c. remanei, c. brenneri, and c. japonica.

hillier and colleagues constructed the first chromosomal level assembly of c. briggsae  <cit> . taking advantage of orthocluster and this newly constructed c. briggsae assembly, we found that  <dig> % of the c. elegans genome  is covered by synteny blocks that contain at least two genes. the amount of genome coverage by synteny blocks is consistent with a previous report  <cit> . including "synteny blocks" composed of a single gene  only slightly increases the coverage of the c. elegans genome to  <dig> % . this coverage is also in excellent agreement with the work of stein and colleagues   <cit> . thus, the conservation observed between the c. elegans and c. briggsae genomes is accounted for largely by synteny blocks that contain two or more genes. however, the synteny blocks discovered between c. elegans and c. briggsae using orthocluster  are much larger than those identified by the previous whole genome analysis .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, we have demonstrated that orthocluster can be used to accurately identify synteny blocks. additionally, we have found that synteny blocks between c. elegans and c. briggsae are almost three-folds larger than previously identified.
