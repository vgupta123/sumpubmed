BACKGROUND
cyclooligomer depsipeptides  are a prominent class of bioactive peptides produced from various fungi by large multimeric enzyme complexes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases . there are many reports about cods which contain various hydroxyl acids, such as d-hydroxyisovalerate ; examples include the beauvericin
 <cit> , enniatins
 <cit> , destruxin
 <cit> , bassianolide
 <cit> , fusafungine
 <cit> . beauvericin, produced by certain fungi of beauveria <cit> , isaria <cit>  and fusarium <cit>  that exhibits insecticidal, displays antimicrobial, anti-tumor activities, reverses multidrug resistance in candida albicans <cit> . its molecular structure consists of an alternating sequence of three n-methyl-l-phenylalanine and three d-hydroxyisovaleric acids 
 <cit> . thus, the hydroxyl acid is a key intermediate in the formation of the beauvericin.

in mammals, the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids  leucine, isoleucine, and valine proceeds by two-step process, i.e. transamination step  and oxidation step. bcaas are usually transaminated to form 2-keto acids by branched-chain amino acid transaminases . these 2-keto acids are oxidatively decarboxylated by mitochondrial branched-chain 2-ketoacid dehydrogenase
 <cit>  and converted to acyl coa. however, in some fungal species, namely the hydroxysiovalerate-containing cods producers, there is another pathway leading from l-val to d-hiv via the keto acid . d-hydroxyisovalerate dehydrogenase, catalyzes the reversible reduction of 2-ketoisovalertate , the intermediate of branched-chain amino acid metabolism
 <cit> , to d-hiv in the presence of nadph, which cannot be replaced by nadh
 <cit> . so far, d-hivdh has been purified and partially characterized exclusively from the enniatin producer, fusarium sambucinum <cit> , but the corresponding protein and gene sequences were not determined. xu et al., demonstrated the novel kivr-encoding 2-ketoisovalerate reductase is the sole supplier of d-hiv for both beauvericin and bassianolide biosynthesis in beauveria bassiana atcc 7159
 <cit> .

on the other hand, little is known about the bioinformatics’ data about the 2-kiv reductase  in fusarium, thus warranting further study. to date, heterologous production of the gene kivrfp from fusarium has not been achieved; similarly, very little information is available about the role of the kivrfp in the regulation of beauvericin biosynthesis. in order to get a closer insight into the unique and intriguing features of the ketoisovalerate reductase in the fusarium genus, we undertook both genetic and biochemical studies. in the present article, we describe the identification and functional analysis of the kivrfp of fusarium proliferatum lf <dig>  our report demonstrates that the kivrfp constituted a new member of family ketonate oxidoreductases.

characterization of recombinant kivrfp and biochemical properties
the purified kivrfp was subjected to a series of biochemical analysis, including determine the ph optimum, temperature optimum, and effects of various detergents and metal ions. all measurements were carried out in triplicate. the values were the mean of the data. the substrate specificity of the purified kivrfp protein was performed using the following substrates: pyruvate, 2-kiv, 2-ketovalerate, 2-ketobutyrate, 2-ketocapronate and 2-ketoglutarate.

the optimum temperature of purified kivrfp was determined by assaying reductase activities in a 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer  for a temperature range of 25-65°c, in which 2-kiv  acted as substrate. optimal ph was determined by examining the activity of the enzyme after incubation at 40°c for 10 min using 2-kiv  as substrate. the buffers used were: 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer , 50 mm tris–hcl buffer .

nucleotide sequence accession number
the dna sequence of kivrfp from fusarium proliferatum lf <dig> was deposited in genbank under accession number of jq <dig> 

RESULTS
cloning and sequence analysis of kivrfp
we have recently cloned and functionally characterized beauvericin biosynthetic locus  of the f. proliferatum lf <dig> genome . the fpbeas gene encoding the beauvericin synthetase was found to be clustered with a gene  encoding a deduced putative 2-ketoisovalerate reductase . amino acid sequence alignment indicated that kivrfp exhibited low identity with other ketopantoate reductases or hypothetical proteins in genbank. kivrfp shared the highest sequence identity with the kivr from b. bassiana atcc  <dig> , followed by the putative 2-ketopantoate reductase from metarhizium acridum cqma  <dig> . similarity was also detected with the hypothetical or putative 2-dehydropantoate reductases from gibberella zeae ph- <dig>  and f. oxysporum fo <dig> , and also with functionally uncharacterized terminal reductase domain of the xylaria sp. bassianolide synthetase .

various ketonate reductases contain the conserved gxgxxg nucleotide-binding signature. and also, a conserved glutamate , an asparagines  and a lysine , together constituting a catalytic triad
 <cit> . the amino acid sequence alignment to other ketonate reductases retrieved from genbank, identified the conserved motifs, including the putative gxgxxg nucleotide-binding signature and a glu-asn-lys triad active site architecture . thus, kivrfp probably uses a catalytic triad consisting of the glutamate , the asparagine  and the highly conserved lysine  for catalysis. all these residues are conserved in the f. proliferatum kivrfp that might contribute to the formation of the active hole and involve directly in the catalytic process
 <cit> . furthermore, to clarify the phylogenetic relationship of the kivrfp with other ketonate reductases, a neighbor joining phylogenetic tree was constructed using the amino acid sequence of the ketonate reductive enzymes. as shown in figure
 <dig>  in this tree, kivrfp formed a distinct group with the kivr of b. bassiana atcc <dig> , which is located closest to the branch of putative 2-ketopantoate reductase of metarhizium acridum cqma  <dig> , hypothetical protein of trichoderma virens gv29- <dig> and cordyceps militaris cm <dig> . moreover, kivrfp showed sequence and the structural similarity with ketopantoate reductases
 <cit> , but not with d-lactose or d-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase
 <cit> . these results suggest that the kivrfp is a new member of family ketonate reductases.

expression and purification of recombinant kivrfp
to investigate the property of this kivrfp, optimized kivrfp gene was expressed as an n-terminal his-tag fusion protein using pet-28a  expression system in e. coli bl <dig>  the recombinant protein was analyzed by sds-page and coomassie brilliant blue staining . these results indicate that recombinant kivrfp protein is expressed , as which correlated well to the predicted full length of kivrfp. the purity of the purified protein was more than 98% according to sds–page analysis.

substrate and cofactor specificity of kivrfp
we expressed kivrfp as a hexahistidine-tagged  protein and investigated its substrate specificity. the enzyme exhibited the highest activity towards 2-kiv as substrate, while the homologues compounds 2-ketovalerate, pyruvate, 2-ketocapronate, 2-ketoglutarate and 2-ketobutyrate were shown to be poor substrates . and also, the kivrfp showed higher coenzyme specificity with respect to nadph than nadh , which is a little different from highly specific d-hydroxyisovalerate dehydrogenase from enniatin producer f. sambucinum.

effect of temperature and ph on kivrfp
reduction of 2-kiv activity of kivrfp was determined from 25°c to 65°c. the purified kivrfp showed highest activity at 35°c. however, the activity of kivrfp reduced quickly above 55°c . thermostability analysis showed that kivrfp was not stable and lost activity in less than 10 min at 60°c . and also, the reductase showed activity in a rather broader ph range of  <dig> - <dig> . maximal activity was observed at ph  <dig>  and lost activity at ph  <dig>  using 2-ketoisovalerate and nadph as substrates . however, the optimum temperature and ph of oxidative reaction were found to be 40°c and  <dig>  respectively .

effect of metal ions on kivrfp
the effects of metal ions and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid  on the kivrfp reductase activity were investigated by measuring the residual enzyme activity in their presence and depicted in table
 <dig>  among metal ions tested, the reductase activity was increased by mg2+ , ca2+  and a slight increase observed by k+ . furthermore, the reduction activity was inhibited by fe2+ and co2+, moreover, almost totally inhibited by cu2+, mn2+, zn,2+ and fe3+ , while the chelating agent edta had little effect, suggesting mg2+ and ca2+ are not determining factors, though they could promote the reductase enzyme activity.

activity without metal ions was set as 100%. all measurements were repeated three times.

effect of detergents and enzyme inhibitors on kivrfp
the effects of detergents and enzyme inhibitors on ketoisovalerate reductase  reduction activity are shown in table
 <dig>  a significant increase in reductive activity was observed with addition of 3 mm dtt , tween- <dig> , depc , and tween- <dig> , after  <dig>  h preincubation with detergents at 37°c, which might help the substrate interaction with the catalytic triad. moreover,  <dig> % β-mercaptoethanol did not affect the reductive activity , whereas ctab, pmsf, triton x- <dig>  and sds strongly inhibited enzymatic activity of kivrfp. the activity inhibition of kivrfp by pmsf suggests that serine is involved in the catalytic center, since pmsf could mimic the first transition state in ester bond hydrolysis presumably by linking to the hydroxyl group of serine in the active site covalently. the enzymatic activity of kivrfp is totally inhibited by ionic detergent and the probable reasons for these are ionic detergents such as sds inhibits both inter- and intra-molecular protein-protein interaction.

activity without detergents and enzyme inhibitors was set as 100%. all measurements were repeated three times.

discussion
ketoisovalerate reductases are types of oxidoreductases which are widely distributed from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and which are involved in primary and second metabolism
 <cit> . 2-hydroxyisovalerate is a common 2-hydroxycarboxylate constituent of depsipeptides. reduction of kiv in fungi provides hiv, a precursor for the biosynthesis of nonribosomal depsipeptides and aroma compounds. fungal cyclooligomer depsipeptides synthetase a domains incorporate free 2-hydroxycarboxylate precursors for the synthesis of cods, preformed by dissociated, independent, monofunctional, nadph-dependent enzymes with high chiral specificity, exemplified by the d-hiv dehydrogenase purified from the enniatin producer f. sambucinum 
 <cit> . in contrast, known bacterial depsipeptide synthetases employ a domains that activate and load 2-ketocarboxylates as β-ketoacyl thioesters onto their cognate t domains, and utilize integrated ketoacyl reductase domains for the synthesis of 2-hydroxycarboxylate thioesters. this might suggest the biosynthesis of 2-hydroxycarboxylate precursors in bacteria and fungi may represent example of convergent evolution
 <cit> . this enzyme, which plays a key role in beauvericin biosynthesis, catalyzes the reversible reaction of 2-kiv to d-hiv using nadh as a cofactor. 2-ketoisovalerate reductase differs from other nadph-dependent oxidoreductases with broad substrate specificity by its high affinity for 2-kiv . the high specificity of kivrfp may also explain the fact that d-hiv is the exclusive hydroxy acid component in beauvericin isolated from fusaria . to our knowledge this is the first report about the heterologous production of a ketoisovalerate reductase with higher substrate specificity for 2-kiv.

kivrfp, which was cloned, expressed, and purified, was subjected to molecular and biochemical experiments in this study. the f. proliferatum kivrfp exhibits high amino acid sequence similarity to b. bassiana kivr and deduced dehydropantoate reductases of fungi, together with low but significant sequence similarity predicted secondary structure to prokaryotic ketopantoate reductases such as pane of e. coli <cit> . kivrfp and the related b. bassiana kivr are predicted to share the n-terminal αβ-rossmann fold and the c-terminal α-helical catalytic domain architecture of the e. coli ketopantoate reductase. in the amino acid sequence of kivrfp, the conserved catalytic triad  and substrates stabilization active amino acids of ketonate oxidoreductases are still the same. in ketopantoate reductase pane from e. coli, the protonated lys <dig>  could function as a general acid to polarize the carbonyl in the direction of ketopantoate reduction, facilitates the hydride transfer from nadph to the c <dig> carbonyl of ketopantoate, and protonates the intermediate alkoxide
 <cit> . asn <dig>  forms hydrogen binding both with the carboxylate of the ketopantoate and with the ribose of the nicotinamide: this orients the cofactor. and also, glu <dig>  and lys <dig>  further participate substrate binding to the nadph
 <cit> . further stabilization is provided by a hydrogen bond between the ser <dig>  and carboxyl group of the ketopantoate, and between asn <dig>  and the a-hydroxy group of the product. and also, kivrfp showed sequence and the structural similarity with ketopantoate reductases, but not with d-lactose or d-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase
 <cit> . further biochemical assay demonstrated that fusarium kivrfp could utilize nadph and nadh as coenzyme, while the nadph is preferred . in accordance to our results, bacterial chiral enzymes belonging to the d-ketoacid reductases superfamily also could utilize nadh as coenzyme, and also feature a conserved arg--his active site triad
 <cit> . based on the phylogenetic, molecular, and biochemical analysis results, we propose that kivrfp is a new member of family ketonate oxidoreductases. future work will establish the structure of this enzyme to gain more information about its catalytic mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we identified a new ketoisovalerate reductase kivrfp from the depsipeptide-producing fungus f. proliferatum. kivrfp is expected to show high potential for downstream biotechnological applications including synthetic organic chemistry and combinatorial biosynthesis beauvericin homologues. this was confirmed by its extensive biochemical characterization, which revealed the enzymes substrate specificity, wide ph and temperature spectra, and also, stability towards addictives including metal ions and detergents. enlargement of the ketoisovalerate reductase pool can be an immediate source of genetic modification, or yield enzymes that can be further specialized by directed evolution, and also, this would optimize their industrial applications.
