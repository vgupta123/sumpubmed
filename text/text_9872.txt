BACKGROUND
studies conducted to understand nuclear organization and function have revealed that the nucleus contains a myriad of dynamic, highly organized domains, territories and bodies  <cit> . the cajal body  is one such structure and contains the highest concentration of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins  in the nucleus  <cit> . snrnps are a vital part of the pre-mrna processing machinery, necessary for both splice site recognition and the splicing reaction. more precisely, the catalyst for the splicing reaction is probably the small nuclear ribonucleic acid  component of the snrnp  <cit> . the human u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> snrnas share the intriguing characteristic in that they contain numerous post-transcriptionally modified nucleotides, namely pseudouridines and 2'-o-methyl groups  <cit> . these modifications appear to be important for efficient splicing of rna and, in the case of u <dig>  are essential for spliceosomal assembly  <cit> . in addition to base modification, u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> snrnas undergo an elaborate maturation pathway in which they are exported to the cytoplasm. in the cytoplasm, these snrnas are substrates for the survival of motor neurons  protein  <cit> . mutations in smn cause the neurodegenerative disorder spinal muscular atrophy  <cit> . smn is essential for the assembly of core sm proteins  onto the snrna  <cit> , and participates in additional modification steps and the import of nascent snrnps into the nucleus  <cit> .

after their transport into the nucleus, newly formed snrnps accumulate first in the cb and then localize to interchromatin granule clusters, which are also known as speckles  <cit> . recent work from the groups of kiss and bertrand has shown that cbs contain small guide rnas, termed small cajal body-specific rnas , which localize exclusively to the cb and guide modifications of u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> snrna by pseudouridylation and 2'-o-methylation  <cit> . additional work from this same group demonstrates that these snrnas are indeed subject to base modification in the cb after import from the cytoplasm  <cit> . for example, short fragments of sm snrnas are modified when they are targeted to the cb, but are not modified when targeted to the nucleolus. other work has shown that telomerase rna shares structural similarities to scarnas and is also enriched within the cajal body  <cit> . it is possible, therefore, that cbs may play a role in the assembly of the telomerase holoenzyme in addition to its clear role in snrna modification. still additional work implicates cbs in u4/u <dig> assembly  <cit> , u4/u <dig> u <dig> tri-snrnp recycling  <cit> , u <dig> snrnp biogenesis  <cit>  and u <dig> small nucleolar rna transport  <cit> .

the marker protein for the cb is considered to be coilin, but the majority  of coilin is actually diffusely localized throughout the nucleoplasm  <cit> . although coilin is conserved among vertebrates and homologues are present in plants, a corresponding gene has not been identified in worms and flies  <cit> . nevertheless, cb-like structures are present in a variety of insects, including drosophila  <cit> . the accumulation of snrnps within cbs is contingent upon coilin  <cit>  and characterization of coilin knockout mice demonstrates that inbred strains have significant viability and fertility defects  <cit> . cell lines derived from coilin knockout mice do not have cbs, but instead have residual cbs which fail to accumulate snrnps or smn  <cit> . thus while not an essential protein, coilin likely plays an important role in coordinating the activities of various types of rna processing machineries into a common nuclear structure  <cit> .

coilin has been shown to interact directly with smn and various sm proteins and can compete with smb' for binding sites on smn  <cit> . the interaction between coilin and smn has been found to be contingent upon several arginine/glycine  dipeptide repeats present within coilin  <cit> . these arginines are symmetrically dimethylated, increasing the affinity of smn for coilin  <cit> . in the nucleus, smn localizes in most cell types and cell lines to cbs  <cit> . curiously, smn exists in some cell lines and fetal tissues in discrete nuclear structures termed "gems"   <cit> . the presence of smn gems correlates with a decrease in coilin methylation  <cit> .

it is not yet understood how nascent snrnps are targeted to the cb for modification. also unclear is how snrnps are released from the cb after modification of the snrna moiety takes place. moreover, the function of coilin in the nucleoplasm, where the majority of the protein is found, remains elusive. in this work, we identify a novel protein isoform of the eb-1/aida- <dig> gene, aida-1c, as a coilin interacting protein. expression analysis demonstrates that aida-1c is present in neuronal tissue and cancer cell lines. aida-1c competes with smb' for coilin binding sites and localizes predominantly to the nucleoplasm when ectopically expressed. other eb-1/aida- <dig> isoforms, in particular aida-1a, have been shown to interact with the amyloid-β protein precursor  intracellular domain   <cit> . all known eb-1/aida- <dig> isoforms contain a conserved phosphotyrosine binding  domain, indicating a role in signal transduction and/or protein:protein interaction  <cit> . interestingly, aida-1a does not interact with coilin in vivo as efficiently as aida-1c. these findings suggest that specific eb-1/aida- <dig> isoforms, such as aida-1c, may participate in the regulation of nucleoplasmic coilin protein interactions, and thereby indirectly affect cb activity in neuronal and transformed cells.

RESULTS
isolation of aida-1c
to broaden our understanding of cajal bodies and coilin, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen with coilin as bait. we chose a human brain cdna library for this assay because we are interested in assessing cb protein dynamics in neuronal tissue, which is the cell type primarily affected in spinal muscular atrophy. the c-terminal  <dig> aa of coilin, which contains the rg box, was the bait for the screen. this region of coilin mediates the interaction between coilin and smn. additionally, c <dig> of coilin is sufficient to interact with sm proteins  <cit> . consequently, other proteins that bind c <dig> may regulate the interplay between coilin/smn and coilin/sm and thus play a role in cb dynamics. the isolation of proteins that interact with this important region of coilin is therefore a key first step towards understanding how rnps are targeted to, modified within and released from the cb.

several preys were recovered from the screen, one of which appeared to be a partial coding sequence of an eb- <dig> protein isoform. transcription of eb- <dig> is activated in t pre-b cell acute lymphocytic leukemia  <cit> . this translocation produces the chimeric oncoprotein e2a-pbx <dig>  leading to the aberrant expression of three tissue-specific genes, eb- <dig> among them. recent work has identified other isoforms emanating from this gene and have found that at least one of these proteins associates with the amyloid-β protein precursor  intracellular domain  and hence are termed aida proteins  <cit> . alterations in aβpp processing are thought to underlie the pathology of alzheimer's disease. all known isoforms of the eb-1/aida- <dig> gene contain a phosphotyrosine binding  domain, including the apparently truncated protein we isolated from the two-hybrid screen. ptb domains were initially characterized as protein interaction modules that bind to regions containing phosphotyrosine  <cit> . however, these domains have also been found to be important for protein:protein interaction in the absence of phosphotyrosine, possibly serving as a platform for a broad range of associations  <cit> . in addition to the ptb domain, some isoforms of eb-1/aida- <dig> contain other protein interaction domains such sterile alpha motifs   <cit>  and ankyrin repeats  <cit> .

since the cdna clone obtained from the two-hybrid screen against coilin appears to be incomplete , we conducted pcr on a human brain cdna library using a forward primer specific to the translation start of another eb-1/aida- <dig> isoform, aida-1a, and a reverse primer specific to the 3' end of the isolated cdna. sequencing of the resultant product demonstrated that we amplified a novel eb-1/aida- <dig> isoform, which we have termed aida-1c . aida-1c is  <dig> amino acids length and has a predicted molecular weight of  <dig> kda. we have not tested if aida-1c binds the aid domain of the amyloid-β protein precursor. alignment of the protein sequence of aida-1c with aida-1a demonstrates that the c-terminus of aida-1c differs from aida-1a . furthermore, while the n-terminus of aida-1c is identical to aida-1a, aida-1c contains an internal deletion between the sam and ptb domains not found in aida-1a or other known isoforms. we could not amplify a product that contained the translational start of aida-1b and the 3' exon of aida-1c.

to get an approximate idea as to the expression profile of aida-1c mrna, we conducted a multi-tissue northern blot using a probe derived from the unique 3' end of aida-1c . this probe should therefore discriminate between aida-1c and other isoforms, unless they share the same 3' exon and untranslated region as found for aida-1c. a band of approximately  <dig> kbp in length corresponding to the aida-1c message is detected only in neuronal tissue . to explore if aida-1c expression can be detected in cell lines, we conducted nested pcr using primers specific to the 3' end of aida-1c on cdna made from various cancer lines. as shown in figure 2b, aida-1c expression can be detected in all six cell lines. we also observed expression of aida-1c in hela cells, as assessed by rt-pcr . these results show that aida-1c is detected in cancer cells and is expressed at the highest level in brain among normal tissues. however, since nested- and rt-pcr are much more sensitive techniques than northern blotting, we cannot exclude the possibility that low levels of this isoform are present in normal tissues.

a 47kda. protein reactive to aida- <dig> antibodies interacts with the c-terminus of coilin
since the two-hybrid result indicates that coilin interacts with a member of the eb-1/aida- <dig> protein family, possibly aida-1c, we decided to screen hela lysate for eb-1/aida- <dig> proteins that interact with coilin. as a first step, we monitored the expression of eb-1/aida- <dig> proteins from hela cytoplasmic and nuclear extract using anti-aida- <dig> antibodies   <cit> . this antibody was made using a peptide whose sequence is also present in aida-1c, and has been confirmed to specifically recognize a number of proteins in human brain extract  <cit> . by immunoblotting of hela lystate, anti-aida- <dig> detects several proteins in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions . in particular, three prominent proteins, approximately  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda. in size, are detected by anti-aida- <dig> in nuclear extract. a doublet migrating around  <dig> kda. in size is also detected, albeit faintly. to test if any of these proteins interact with coilin, which is also nuclear, we subjected hela nuclear lysate to immunoprecipitation with anti-aida- <dig> antibodies, followed by sds-page and western blotting with anti-coilin antibodies. we could not detect endogenous coilin association with any aida- <dig> protein . however, ectopically expressed myc-tagged coilin can be specifically co-immunoprecipitated by anti-aida- <dig> antibodies, but not by normal rabbit serum . the interaction between coilin and eb-1/aida- <dig> proteins is specific, but likely to be weak or transient given that the input lane accounts for 1/20th the amount of lysate used in the immunoprecipitation reactions .

to corroborate this result and ascertain which eb-1/aida- <dig> protein associates with coilin, we incubated total hela or sk-mel- <dig> lysate with gst alone or gst fused to the c-terminal  <dig> aa of coilin. this region of coilin was used in the two-hybrid screen and interacts with sm proteins and smn. after extensive washes, the beads were subjected to sds-page and western blotting with anti-aida- <dig> antibodies. no proteins reactive to anti-aida- <dig> antibodies were recovered over gst beads, but a  <dig> kda. protein was retained by the c-terminal  <dig> aa coilin fragment in both hela and sk-mel- <dig> reactions . thus the c-terminus of coilin mediates interaction with the  <dig> kda. eb-1/aida- <dig> nuclear protein. of all the known eb-1/aida- <dig> isoforms, only aida-1c and a putative protein found in the genbank database  closely match the size of the protein that interacts with the c-terminus of coilin. to confirm that aida-1c migrates through sds-page gels with an apparent size of  <dig> kda., we purified a his-t7-tag fusion of aida-1c and ran this on a gel with hela nuclear extract. probing with anti-aida- <dig> demonstrates that his-t7-aida-1c has a mobility of around  <dig> kda. , indicating that an untagged protein would migrate at 47– <dig> kda. .

aida-1c interaction with coilin in vivo and in vitro
to establish if aida-1c interacts with coilin, as suggested from the immunoprecipitation and two-hybrid experiments described above, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments on lysate from hela cells transfected with empty gfp vector or gfp-aida-1c using anti-gfp antibodies followed by western blotting with anti-coilin antibodies. we also tested another nuclear eb-1/aida- <dig> isoform, aida-1a, for its ability to associate with coilin in vivo. as shown in figure 4a, coilin specifically interacts with gfp-aida-1c, but not gfp alone, despite the large amount of immunoprecipitated gfp  has been underexposed six-fold relative to the signals in lane  <dig> and 6). yfp-aida-1a associates with coilin above background levels, but below that found for aida-1c . reprobing of the same blot verified that both fp-aida-1c and fp-aida-1a were expressed and immunoprecipitated equally . therefore, we conclude that aida-1a does not form a complex with coilin as efficiently as aida-1c.

to determine if the interaction between aida-1c and coilin is direct, we conducted gst-pulldown assays using purified recombinant proteins. we found that soluble full-length coilin is recovered by aida-1c fused to gst . in support of our previous observations suggesting that the interaction between aida-1c and coilin is weak or transient, coilin binding is abolished when the assay was carried out in the presence of increasing salt concentrations . these results indicate that the association between coilin and aida-1c is specific and electrostatic bonds are important for this interaction.

to verify that the coilin fragment used in the two-hybrid assay directly interacts with aida-1c, we conducted gst-pulldown experiments with bacterially expressed aida-1c incubated with gst alone or gst fused to aa 362– <dig> of coilin . we found that aida-1c, detected using anti-aida- <dig> antibodies, interacts directly with the coilin fragment but not with gst alone . the binding site for aida-1c on coilin was further explored using an additional coilin c-terminal fragment  that lacks the coilin rg box . recovery of aida-1c is observed in the reaction using gst-c <dig> of coilin .

aida-1c competes with sm proteins for coilin binding
we have previously shown that the c-terminal  <dig> aa of coilin, in addition to aida-1c binding, also mediates the interaction with smn and sm proteins, such as smb'  <cit> . while the interaction between coilin and smn involves the coilin rg box, which is subject to modification by symmetrical dimethylation  <cit> , the binding site for sm proteins on coilin has not been defined. however, competition binding experiments show that sm proteins and smn may have overlapping binding sites on coilin  <cit> . since aida-1c binds within the same c-terminal  <dig> residues of coilin as do smn and sm proteins, we investigated whether aida-1c may compete with sm proteins for coilin binding sites. aida-1c can effectively compete with smb' for coilin binding sites . we did not observe a direct interaction between smn and aida-1c . thus, the findings that aida-1c competes with sm proteins and binds downstream of the coilin rg box suggest that sm proteins and smn have overlapping but distinct binding sites on coilin. the interaction studies also demonstrate that one function of aida-1c may be to modify coilin protein dynamics.

cellular localization of ectopically expressed aida-1c
given that aida-1c interacts with coilin, and that a 47kda. protein which is possibly aida-1c is found in nuclear extract, we were interested in assessing the cellular localization of aida-1c by transient transfection into hela cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  gfp-tagged aida-1c is localized diffusely in the nucleus, excluding nucleoli, with some staining in the cytoplasm. we did not detect significant enrichment of aida-1c in cbs . a similar localization pattern has been observed for aida-1a  <cit> . therefore, interactions between aida-1c and coilin may be taking place in the nucleoplasm. indeed, while coilin is highly enriched in the cb, the majority  of the protein is diffusely localized throughout the nucleoplasm  <cit> . to determine the localization of endogenous eb-1/aida- <dig> proteins, we stained hela cells with antibodies to eb-1/aida- <dig> proteins. despite the fact that anti-aida- <dig> works well by immunoblotting, this antibody does not detect nuclear proteins in hela cells by immunofluorescence  <cit>  . we are currently developing an antibody to the unique c-terminus of aida-1c in order to specifically detect this isoform.

knockdown of eb-1/aida- <dig> proteins by sirna reduces cell viability and disrupts cajal bodies
the studies described above suggest that a subset of eb-1/aida- <dig> proteins may play a role in cajal body protein dynamics. to further explore this possibility, sirna was used to target all known eb-1/aida- <dig> proteins. for this experiment, cells were treated with eb-1/aida- <dig> sirna for  <dig> hours, followed by nuclear lysate preparation and western blotting using anti-aida- <dig> antibodies. three prominent bands reactive to anti-aida- <dig> are detected in nuclear lysate from mock treated cells  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda. in size . the amounts of these proteins is significantly reduced in extract obtained from cells treated with eb-1/aida- <dig> sirna. in fact, the  <dig> kda. protein, which we believe is aida-1c, is reduced by  <dig>  fold as assessed by densitometric analysis. reprobing of the same blot with anti-smn demonstrates that an approximately equal amount of nuclear protein was loaded in each lane.

during these experiments, we noticed an increased rate of cell death in cells treated with eb-1/aida- <dig> sirna compared to mock treated. we quantified this phenomenon by conducting experiments with mock-, eb-1/aida-1-, or control sirna-treatment followed by cell counting using the trypan blue exclusion method. the control sirna used in this study is functional in that it is processed by the risc machinery, but is non-targeting . thus this sirna is an excellent control for off-target effects. in fact, there is no reduction in cell viability when using the control sirna. in contrast, only 45%  of cells are viable upon treatment with eb-1/aida- <dig> sirna.

since eb-1/aida- <dig> sirna causes cell death and a subset of eb-1/aida- <dig> isoforms interact with the cajal body protein coilin, we investigated if nuclear organization, in particular cajal body structure, was disrupted upon treating cells with eb-1/aida- <dig> sirna. the normal localization of coilin in cbs is shown in figure 6b , as is the typical distribution of snrnps in speckles and cbs . in contrast, cbs and speckles display altered structures in the presence of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin d . specifically, cbs relocalize to nucleolar caps  and speckles enlarge . cells exposed to eb-1/aida- <dig> sirna have noticeable changes in nuclear organization compared to mock- or control sirna-treated cells. notably, coilin and cbs are reorganized in a manner reminiscent to that observed when treating cells with actinomycin d . in contrast, mock or control treated cells are indistinguishable from normal cells with regard to cb organization . one noticeable difference between the phenotype of eb-1/aida- <dig> sirna versus actinomycin d treated cells is that snrnps, as assessed by y <dig> staining, are co-localized with coilin in eb-1/aida- <dig> sirna cells . previous reports  <cit>  and our work  have shown that snrnps do not co-localize with coilin in actinomycin d treated cells. it is conceivable, therefore, that the observed cell death upon treating cells with eb-1/aida- <dig> sirna is the result of altered cajal body organization rather than simply an arrest of transcription. given that several eb-1/aida- <dig> proteins are likely to be targeted by the eb-1/aida- <dig> sirna, we cannot ascertain the specific function of aida-1c in these experiments. however, if aida-1c does participate in snrnp trafficking through the cb, then we would expect to observe altered snrnp transport when aida-1c levels are reduced. the presence of snrnps in coilin-containing nucleolar cap structures formed by eb-1/aida- <dig> sirna treatment is therefore consistent with a role of aida-1c in snrnp displacement from the cb.

CONCLUSIONS
the isolation and partial characterization of aida-1c demonstrates that specific eb-1/aida- <dig> protein isoforms may regulate the dynamics of coilin protein interactions in the nucleoplasm. little is known about the role of nucleoplasmic coilin, even though this fraction accounts for the majority of the protein  <cit> . for example, coilin could interact with snrnps in the nucleoplasm and bring them to the cb. coilin association with aida-1c in the nucleoplasm might therefore affect the protein composition of the cb indirectly. if correct, then we would expect that the specific disruption of aida-1c expression would alter some aspect of snrnp biogenesis or cb function. current experiments are underway to test this hypothesis.

it is noteworthy that aida-1c expression can be detected in both neuronal and cancer cells given that cajal bodies are prominent in these cells  <cit> . curiously, certain neurodegenerative disorders such as spinal muscular atrophy  dramatically affect neuronal cells even though the mutant protein  is ubiquitously expressed. why is neuronal tissue so susceptible to disease proteins? one possible explanation is that neuronal cells, which are known to undergo a high degree of alternative splicing  <cit> , cannot tolerate deficiencies in splicing. it may be that a range of neurodegenerative disorders, through a variety of mechanisms, affect the level of neuronal alternative splicing by disrupting cajal body function. consequently, in addition to other cellular processes which are disturbed in some neurodegenerative disorders, inadequate levels of snrnps may exacerbate the deleterious effects of the disease protein in neuronal tissue. interestingly, cbs are not normally found in every human cell but are present in immortalized or transformed cells  <cit> . the induction of cbs in cancer cells may reflect on the need for increased levels of snrnps. given the presence of cbs in neuronal and cancer cells, it would not be surprising if various factors were upregulated in these cell types to meet their rnp demands. indeed, eb- <dig> mrna is normally expressed in brain and testis but is dramatically induced in marrow from patients having a specific acute lymphocytic leukemia  <cit> . likewise, we have found that aida-1c expression can be detected both in brain and certain cancer cell lines. we propose that aida-1c expression in neuronal and cancer cell lines may facilitate snrnp biogenesis by modulating the interaction between coilin and snrnps.
