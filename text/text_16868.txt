BACKGROUND
rna sequencing  technology has rapidly become the preferred choice for gene expression analysis as it allows for high throughput over a wide range of expression levels  <cit> . yet, some features of rna-seq data still pose considerable challenges for differential expression  analysis, in particular related to transcripts with low levels of expression, as characterized by low number of read counts  <cit> . so called low-count transcripts often show large variability of logarithmic fold change  estimates and thus exhibit inherently noisier inferential behavior  <cit> . thus, it is not surprising that standard protocols for processing of rna-seq data call for filtering out transcripts with read counts below predetermined expression thresholds  <cit> . as a consequence of data filtering, low-count transcripts are often excluded from de analyses and ignored for the purpose of inference. thus, it is plausible that important transcripts of low expression levels, such as transcription factors, may be easily overlooked despite their key role as master regulators of downstream gene expression  <cit> .

data filtering prior to de analyses was originally implemented in an attempt to control noise and reduce the impact of multiple testing adjustments on power for de detection by removal of uninformative or weakly expressed transcripts  <cit> . nevertheless, thresholds for filtering are usually specified with little, if any, biological rationale and at seemingly arbitrary cut-offs that vary widely across studies  <cit> . recent advances in statistical methods available for de analyses of rna-seq data may provide alternative approaches to deal with weakly expressed transcripts without the need for data filtering at arbitrary expression thresholds. more specifically, methods like deseq <dig>  <cit> , edger  <cit>  and edger robust  <cit>  have become particularly popular. most notably, these methods attempt to handle extremely large counts on rna-seq transcripts, which may unwittingly also facilitate inference on low-count transcripts. that is, rather than filtering out low-count transcripts at arbitrary cut-off threshold and excluding them from de analysis, these statistical methods could potentially be used to account for the increased uncertainty associated with low-count transcripts. both deseq <dig> and edger have in common a generalized linear mixed models framework that relies on the negative binomial distribution family and efficiently borrows information across transcripts to moderate transcript-specific dispersion estimates  <cit> . as an additional advantage, deseq <dig> shrinks lfc estimates towards a common mean in a manner inversely proportional to the amount of information available for a transcript  <cit> . limited information due to either a high level of dispersion  or a low level of expression  causes transcript-specific lfc estimates to shrink towards zero. in turn, the latest release of edger, namely edger robust, works by down weighting observations that deviate from the model fit  <cit> , thereby dampening the effect that observations with very high or very low expression levels have on transcript-specific estimates of mean expression and dispersion. as a trade-off, edger robust requires specification of a degrees of freedom  parameter that controls the amount of shrinkage in the estimation process. unless explicitly specified by the user, the df parameter defaults to a set predetermined value  <cit>  that may be appropriate for some, but not necessarily all data applications. interestingly, no such user specification is required by deseq2; rather, all necessary parameters are estimated from the data.

in this study, we use a data application on prairie grasses to illustrate inferential challenges related to low-count transcripts in rna-seq de analyses. our motivating interest in low-count rna-seq transcripts stems from our ongoing work with the wide-ranging prairie grass big bluestem  and its edaphic subspecies sand bluestem . big bluestem  is a widely-distributed dominant grass of north american grasslands  <cit>  and constitutes the main native forage grass for cattle in the us great plains  <cit> . in contrast, sand bluestem’s  habitat consists primarily of the sand hills in nebraska . our preliminary studies  <cit>  pointed towards phenotypic differences between bb and sb subspecies that are consistent with enhanced drought tolerance of sb. for instance, we observed a greater quantity of epicuticular wax on the leaf surface of sb plants relative to that of bb  <cit> . further, analysis of epicuticular wax components showed presence of approximately ~20 % β-diketones on sb leaves, whereas β-diketones were absent in epicuticular wax of bb leaves  <cit> . differential quantity and quality of epicuticular wax on leaf surfaces could affect heat reflectance and transmittance, thus providing differential relative advantages to heat tolerance in dry conditions. further, epicuticular wax decreased light absorbance in sand bluestem  <cit> , thus potentially lowering internal leaf temperature and further protecting sb grasses against heat stress. taken together, our preliminary studies indicate that adaptation of sb to water-limited conditions may involve adaptation of leaf cuticle chemistry, morphology, and function. sand bluestem’s enhanced tolerance to dry conditions relative to bb  <cit>  is of interest due to the expected increase in extreme droughts throughout midwest grasslands  <cit> . in this study, we further characterize differences between bb and sb subspecies at the transcriptome level. following from the qualitative phenotypic divergence observed between sb and bb, we initially focused on rna transcripts that were expressed in only one of the bluestem subspecies, with expression absent in the other. more specifically, we considered sb-only transcripts that were expressed in sand bluestem samples but were absent  in big bluestem samples and, conversely, bb-only transcripts that were expressed only in bb grasses. we further noticed that these sb-only and bb-only transcripts were characterized by few read counts in the corresponding grasses where they were detected, indicating overall low levels of expression. for this study, we purposely defined so called low-count transcripts following the descriptive approach proposed by bullard  <cit> , such that low-count transcripts were those below the 60th percentile of least relative abundance, accounting for approximately 3 % of total read counts . for contrast, we also defined so-called high-count transcripts, corresponding to transcripts in the top 3rd percentile relative abundance and accounting for 60 % of total read counts in the dataset . out of  <dig>  total transcripts identified in our dataset of bluestem grasses,  <dig>  transcripts were defined as low-count transcripts due to a total read count below  <dig> for each sample ; whereas  <dig> transcripts were defined as high-count transcripts with a total read count above  <dig>  for each sample . therefore, it is apparent that low-count transcripts constitute a non-trivial subset of transcripts, a substantial part of which would likely be excluded from analyses based on standard data filtering practices. further, all  <dig> sb-only transcript and  <dig> bb-only transcripts in the dataset were also identified as low-count transcripts , thus providing specific motivation to our study of transcripts with low expression levels.fig.  <dig> partitioning of high-count transcripts and low-count transcripts. cumulative percentage of total read counts  as a function of cumulative percentage of transcripts , starting on the left with transcripts of highest read counts. solid colored lines indicate the 3rd percentile most highly expressed transcripts  and the 60th percentile least expressed transcripts , thereby defining high-count transcripts  and low-count transcripts , respectively

the table contains the number of total transcripts, high-count transcripts and low-count transcripts available for differential expression analyses in the complete dataset  or following data filtering based on a reads-present  criterion or a counts per million  criterion. also listed are number of transcripts with expression levels present in sand bluestem and absent in big bluestem , and transcripts with expression levels present in big bluestem and absent in sand bluestem 



to deal with the additional uncertainty that characterizes low-count transcripts due to limited information in their low level of expression, we implement the recently developed statistical methods edger robust and deseq <dig>  both having shown promising results in simulation studies and in selected real datasets  <cit> . however, relative performance of these methods has often been shown to be data dependent, such that their relative results may differ across datasets  <cit> . thus, it is unclear how one might decide between these statistical methods for de analysis in a specific situation. plasmodes have been proposed as a strategy to validate statistical methods, or even assess relative performance of competing methods, on a given -omics dataset  <cit> . probably one of the main advantages of plasmodes is that some characteristics of a particular dataset of interest can be preserved when assessing inference, including the overall distribution of the data as well as any potential gene-to-gene correlation structure  <cit> . more specifically, an rna-seq dataset can be used to generate a null plasmode dataset by randomly partitioning samples of the same treatment condition into two new arbitrary groups. reshuffling of samples creates a null dataset for which no differential expression between groups is to be expected beyond sample-to-sample variation  <cit> . null plasmodes may then be subjected to de analysis to compare type i error between methods, as any transcripts identified as de on a null plasmode would be considered a false positive. plasmodes also allow for the introduction of some known truth, as it happens with simulated data, whereby selected transcripts in a plasmode can be “spiked” with fold changes of known magnitude to create de transcripts, and thus evaluate statistical power and other performance metrics under the alternative hypothesis  <cit> . thus far, plasmodes have been successfully applied to microarray  <cit>  and qpcr data  <cit> , and have most recently been adapted for rna-seq data as well  <cit> .

in this study, we use a plasmode-based approach to assess inferential performance of statistical methods for de analysis of rna-seq data with a special focus on low-count transcripts, as illustrated by our case study on bluestem prairie grasses. in particular, we evaluate the inferential performance of deseq <dig> and edger, with variations on the specification of the df parameter beyond default values for the latter method. we further evaluate the impact of data filtering strategies that are commonly reported in the literature and discuss their implications for inference on low-count transcripts. we believe it is timely that guidelines for data filtering of low expression transcripts in protocols for rna-seq data  <cit>  are revisited, as the impact of this practice on de inference remains unclear, particularly for transcripts that may be biologically relevant despite low expression levels .

RESULTS
plasmodes
given the benchmark status of bb as a widely distributed dominant prairie grass, we generated all plasmodes using bb samples only. to evaluate inferential performance of statistical methods under the null hypothesis, samples of individual bb plants  were randomly partitioned into  <dig> groups of  <dig> samples each, yielding a total of  <dig> null plasmodes. in turn, performance under the alternative hypothesis was evaluated using de plasmodes, that is, modified null plasmodes for which one of the groups had a known proportion of transcripts “spiked” with estimates of effect sizes of transcripts called de from a preliminary analysis  <cit> . a total of  <dig> de plasmodes were generated using all  <dig> null plasmodes as baseline.

on each plasmode, we conducted de analyses using deseq <dig>  edger classic, and edger robust. all of these statistical methods model read counts assuming a negative binomial conditional data likelihood distribution and apply shrinkage to moderate the estimation of dispersion parameters. for edger robust, we specified the df parameter to take values  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  thereby reflecting increasing levels of arbitrarily specified shrinkage. we note that df =  <dig> is the default df specification in edger robust, unless otherwise specified by the user. we also evaluated the performance of edger robust with df specified using an estimate obtained from the classic edger software . we note that a quantile-adjusted conditional maximum likelihood approach for estimation of the df parameter is available in the classic edger software for simple, completely randomized design structures such as that in our motivating problem on bluestem subspecies  <cit> . estimated df values ranged from df^edger= <dig> to <dig>  across null plasmodes, which is noted to be considerably smaller than the default specification . to compare performance of the various de analyses methods, we computed false positive rate , true positive rate  or power, positive predictive value  or precision, negative predictive value , and accuracy, as defined in table  <dig> table  <dig> classification rules to compute performance metrics


fp number of false positives ; tp number of true positives ; tn number of true negatives; fn number of false negatives; fpr, false positive rate = fp/s0; tpr true positive rate or power = tp/s1; ppv positive predictive value or precision = tp/r1; npv negative predictive value = tn/r0; accuracy = /g



we first assessed type i error of de methods on null plasmodes using fpr. since both groups in the null plasmode pertain to the same subspecies and are arbitrarily defined, we do not expect any group differences in expression levels beyond sampling variability. table  <dig> contains estimated fpr for the de methods implemented here, after adjustment to a false discovery rate  of  <dig> . overall, all methods seemed to adequately control fpr below a  <dig>  fdr nominal value for both all transcripts as well as low-count transcripts. nevertheless, deseq <dig> had the lowest fpr and was thus the most conservative of the methods evaluated, followed closely by edger classic and then by edger robust. within edger robust, fpr increased with more degrees of freedom, thus indicating more liberal inference with greater df specifications, though in all cases within the nominal  <dig>  value. these patterns in fpr performance between de methods were apparent when either all transcripts or only low-count transcripts were considered.table  <dig> estimated false positive rates  on null plasmodes

next, we used de plasmodes to compare inferential performance of statistical methods under the alternative hypothesis to detect true differences in expression levels of transcripts. estimated tpr or power, ppv or precision, npv and accuracy based on de plasmodes are displayed in table  <dig>  estimated power across methods ranged from approximately  <dig>  to  <dig>  for all transcripts, and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for low-count transcripts. in both cases, deseq <dig> showed the lowest power, followed by a modest power increase with edger classic and a more substantial power boost with edger robust. within specifications of edger robust, there was no evidence for differences in power when df were specified to be  <dig> or less, but a df =  <dig> specification caused a significant increase in power both for all transcripts and for low-count transcripts. not surprisingly, results on power mirrored those obtained on fpr based on the null plasmodes; that is, methods with the lowest fpr were also methods with the highest number of false negatives and thus, the lowest power. this can be explained by a well-known trade-off between type i and type ii errors in statistical inference.table  <dig> performance metrics on differentially expressed  plasmodes

precision, or ppv, was maximum using deseq <dig> and was estimated at  <dig>  and  <dig>  for all transcripts and low-count transcripts, respectively . in both cases, a significant drop in precision of at least  <dig> to  <dig> percentage points was apparent with edger classic relative to deseq <dig>  whereas the estimated drop in precision was of  <dig> percentage points or more with edger robust relative to deseq <dig>  as the specification of df on edger robust increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  inferential precision decreased further and was nearly halved using edger robust with df =  <dig> relative to deseq <dig>  noteworthy, both for all transcripts and for low-count transcripts, inferential precision using edger robust was greater by approximately  <dig> to  <dig> percentage points when df were estimated as opposed to specified by default . in turn, estimated npv for all de methods was high in magnitude and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for all transcripts as well as for low-count transcripts .

overall inferential accuracy of de analyses ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for all transcripts and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for low-count transcripts. in both cases, maximum accuracy was observed using deseq <dig>  followed in decreasing order by edger classic and then by edger robust, with decreasing accuracy as df increased . again, overall accuracy of de calling using edger robust was greater when df were estimated as opposed to specified by default , though the absolute magnitude of the difference was small . all methods appeared to control fpr in de plasmodes below the nominal value , though deseq <dig> was more conservative than any of the edger methods, particularly for low-count transcripts.

case study: comparison of bluestem subspecies
next, we conducted illustrative de analyses to explore the transcriptomic basis for differences between bb and sb subspecies of bluestem prairie grass, with emphasis on sb-only and bb-only transcripts, all of which were characterized by low levels of expression. our dataset consisted of  <dig> samples of big bluestem and  <dig> of sand bluestem, for which read counts on a total of  <dig>  transcripts were obtained. differential expression analyses between subspecies were conducted using deseq <dig> and edger robust. the specification of df for edger robust was based on quantile-adjusted conditional maximum likelihood estimates using edger classic  <cit> , whereby df^edger= <dig> . figure 2a and d contain ma plots of estimated logarithmic fold changes in the complete dataset  using deseq <dig> and edger robust, respectively. overall, edger robust declared  <dig>  %  of transcripts as de  whereas deseq <dig> declared only  <dig>  %  transcripts as de . this is consistent with results from our plasmode study in the previous section, whereby deseq <dig> had a more conservative type i error performance relative to edger robust, coupled with greater power of the latter. differences in de calling between statistical methods was explained, at least partially, by low-count transcripts, whereby  <dig>  %  of low-count transcripts were declared de by edger robust but only  <dig>  %  were by deseq <dig> . instead, de calling amongst high-count transcripts was  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  for edger robust and deseq <dig>  respectively . overall, a considerable amount of overlap in de calling was apparent between methods, as approximately  <dig>  % of all transcripts declared de by deseq <dig> were also declared de using edger robust . for low-count transcripts in the complete dataset, edger robust declared de approximately  <dig>  % of those also declared de by deseq <dig> .fig.  <dig> ma-plots for edger robust and deseq <dig> with and without data filtering. estimated fold-change in expression of rna-seq transcripts for sb relative to bb as a function of transcript abundance following differential expression analyses with deseq <dig> or edger robust  on data subjected to no filtering  or to filtering with cpm  or rp  methods. for deseq <dig>  fold-changes are plotted over mean transcript expression on a log scale. for edger robust, fold-changes are plotted against counts per million on a log scale. transcripts declared de at fdr =  <dig>  are colored in red

the table contains the number of total transcripts, high-count transcripts and low-count transcripts declared de using edger robust  analyses on the complete dataset  or following data filtering based on reads-present  criterion or counts per million  criterion. also listed are transcripts with expression levels present in sand bluestem and absent in big bluestem  and transcripts with expression levels present in big bluestem and absent in sand bluestem

we further considered sb-only and bb-only transcripts expressed in only one bluestem subspecies and absent in the other. recall that all such transcripts were classified as low-count transcripts due to low expression levels. edger robust identified  <dig>  % /) of such transcripts as de , whereas deseq <dig> called de only  <dig>  % /) . yet, approximately 99 % of transcripts expressed in only one bluestem subspecies and declared de based on deseq <dig> were also declared de by edger robust, again indicating a substantial amount of overlap between the methods.

filtering strategies
we further assessed inferential implications of two commonly used filtering approaches on rna-seq data. samples of bb and sb were subjected to filtering of transcripts defined in terms of mapped reads present   <cit>  and of read counts per million   <cit> . recall that any specific data filtering approach determines the transcriptomic basis to which de analyses are later applied, and thus, any de results.

criteria for data filtering varies across strategies. specifically, the rp filtering approach indicates removal of a transcript if the overall number of samples with mapped reads present for that transcript  is smaller than the number of samples per treatment group   <cit> . in turn, cpm-based filtering indicates removal of a transcript if a pre-selected number of samples have read cpm for that transcript that are smaller than a pre-selected threshold value  <cit> , specified at  <dig> cpm for this study. table  <dig> shows a breakdown of transcripts available for de analyses after rp-based filtering and cpm-based filtering. most notably, rp-based filtering excluded only  <dig> transcripts  from the unfiltered dataset, none of which were low-count transcripts or transcripts present in only one of the subspecies. in contrast, when cpm-based filtering was implemented, a total of  <dig>  transcripts  were excluded from the data, amongst which were  <dig>  low-count transcripts as well as all bb-only transcripts and all sb-only transcripts . as such, only approximately 29 % low-count transcripts, and none of the transcripts present in only one of the bluestem subspecies, were available for de analyses following cpm-based filtering.

next, filtered datasets were subjected to de analysis using edger robust and deseq <dig>  as described in the previous section. tables  <dig> and  <dig> show the breakdown of transcripts declared de by each of the statistical methods on the filtered datasets. transcripts declared de in rp-filtered data were essentially the same transcripts declared de in the unfiltered data  regardless of de analyses. exceptions included additional  <dig> transcripts  or  <dig> transcripts  declared de in the rp-filtered data, but not in unfiltered data. instead, cpm filtering reduced the number of transcripts declared de based on edger robust by  <dig>  % /3173), table 5) and based on deseq <dig> by  <dig>  % /2290), table 6), respectively, relative to unfiltered data. the impact of cpm filtering on de calling was primarily driven by low-count transcripts, for which de calling was reduced by approximately  <dig>  % /2135), table 5) based on edger robust and by  <dig>  % /1325), table 6) based on deseq <dig>  most notably, all  <dig> transcripts present in only one of the bluestem subspecies, that is bb-only and sb-only transcripts, were lost to de inference as cpm-based filtering excluded them from the data prior to de analyses.

figure  <dig> shows ma-plots obtained from fitting deseq <dig> or edger robust to rna-seq data subjected to no filtering , rp-based filtering  or cpm-based filtering  . within each de method, the overall shape of the ma-plots on rp-filtered data resembled that of the unfiltered data. this is not surprising as rp filtering removed only a small proportion  of transcripts from the dataset. in contrast, ma-plots on the cpm-filtered dataset showed a drastically modified pattern relative to unfiltered data, particularly on the left side of each plot, due to a disproportionate exclusion of low-count transcripts, which were also transcripts of more extreme fold-change estimates. within each filtering strategy, the overlap in de calling by edger robust relative to deseq <dig> ranged from  <dig> to 91 % and from  <dig> to 97 % for all transcripts and for low-count transcripts, respectively .

approximate tests for de inference based on deseq2
the most recent release of the deseq package, namely deseq <dig>  <cit> , implemented a wald test approach as the default strategy for de testing on individual transcripts. this approach differs from that of previous versions of deseq, which instead specified by default a likelihood ratio test   <cit> . the rationale behind moving towards a wald test as the default approach seemed to rely on its flexibility for testing individual coefficients or functions thereof, without the need to fit a reduced model  <cit> . yet, one should recognize the approximate nature of both tests, which relies on large sample approximations and assumes either an asymptotic chi-square distribution  or a normal distribution  under the null hypothesis  <cit> .

motivated by our interest in low-count transcripts, we further compared the relative performance of deseq2-based lrt and wald tests for de inference on individual transcripts. figure  <dig> shows scatterplots of unadjusted p-values for de inference obtained from wald tests  and lrt  for both high-count transcripts and low-count transcripts based on a complete dataset  and on filtered datasets. for high-count transcripts, lrt and wald tests showed considerable inferential agreement for de calling regardless of data filtering, as indicated by most points falling along the identity line . in contrast, for low-count transcripts, the wald test had lower p-values for de inference relative to the lrt approach . for this application, it is unclear if the wald test underestimated these p-values or if the lrt overestimated them. this discrepancy is particularly concerning for transcripts with p-values of small magnitude and close to a pre-specified significance threshold given the qualitative differences in inference . this difference in inferential performance observed between wald test-based and lrt-based p-values for low-count transcripts was particularly noticeable in the complete dataset  and on the rp-filtered data, which included all low-count transcripts. instead, p-values from wald test and lrt were more closely aligned to each other on cpm-filtered data. this was expected as most low-count transcripts had already been excluded from de analyses due to being removed during cpm filtering.fig.  <dig> comparison of p-values for deseq <dig> tests on differential expression. scatterplot of p-values for differential expression obtained using deseq2’s likelihood ratio test  and wald test on low-count and high-count transcripts subjected to no filtering  or to filtering with cpm  or rp  methods. diagonal identity line is indicated in red



discussion
in this study, we used plasmodes generated from rna-seq data to compare inferential performance of statistical methods for differential expression, with a special focus on low-count transcripts, as motivated by an application on bluestem prairie grasses. more specifically, we evaluated the inferential performance of the recently developed statistical methods deseq <dig>  edger and edger robust, the latter specified over a range of the df parameter. we also considered data filtering strategies that, while pervasively implemented in rna-seq data pipelines, impose arbitrary criteria for data exclusion, the impact of which on de inference was shown to be substantial.

this study is one of few to use a plasmode-based approach to compare statistical methods on a specific rna-seq dataset and more specifically, on a subset of transcripts characterized by low expression levels  <cit> . we recognize, though, that our null plasmode approach can be sensitive to limited random partitioning of samples into groups, especially if the number of samples available is small, as is our case  <cit> . by design, though, plasmodes allow for evaluation of inferential performance while taking into consideration the realistic conditions of a given data application  <cit> , amongst which one may consider the actual structure of a real dataset and a limited sample size.

our results on inferential performance indicated adequate control of type i error within nominal levels using either deseq <dig> or edger robust both for all transcripts and for low-count transcripts. still, false positive rates increased with greater degrees of freedom under edger robust, indicating the need for careful consideration of how this parameter is specified. in turn, edger robust showed greater power than deseq <dig>  which is consistent with results from previous simulation studies  <cit>  and is hereby shown to also apply to transcripts of low expression levels. interestingly, within specifications of edger robust, there was no evidence for any changes in power when df were specified to be at default  or at a much smaller value estimated from the data  was not optimal and led to a decrease in inferential precision and accuracy relative to using an estimated df value. the default value of the shrinkage parameter for edger robust  seems to be based on an assortment of simulation studies  <cit> . however, it is unclear whether such an arbitrarily specified df value is justified for any particular real rna-seq dataset, for which the amount of dispersion, the correlation structure between transcripts and the sample size may not be aligned with those of simulated conditions  <cit> . our results indicate that the specification of df on edger robust should be informed carefully. this is consistent with warnings raised in other areas of genomic applications about the arbitrary specification of low-level hyperparameters in hierarchical models  <cit> . it would be recommended for df to be estimated from the data whenever possible. alternatively, if complexity of the experimental design prevented proper estimation of the df parameter, a researcher might consider relying more heavily on inference from deseq <dig>  for which no arbitrary specification of df is needed. this is consistent with the relatively standard recommendation that de inference be based on multiple analysis methods  <cit> . for instance, researchers may consider declaring de only those transcripts that show low fdr-adjusted p-values by both deseq <dig> and edger robust with properly specified degrees of freedom. this recommendation is further supported by the high level of overlap in de calling observed between the methods, when properly specified.

data filtering is a common processing step in the rna-seq data management pipeline  <cit> , though its implications have not been thoroughly explored. initial implementations of data filtering for rna-seq counts were intended to reduce the impact of multiple testing adjustment on power for de detection  <cit> . yet, one should note that filtering strategies apply rather arbitrary data exclusion criteria with different, potentially disproportionate, consequences for inference on specific transcripts. for example, our results indicate only a very minor difference in de calling following rp-based filtering compared to no filtering, with 99 % overlap between the two, regardless of de method. this suggests that both edger robust and deseq <dig> retained similar transcripts declared as de regardless of whether the data has been rp-filtered or not. this result thus questions the very need to impose arbitrary filtering rules on the data given the powerful statistical methods available. in turn, more extreme filtering rules such as those based on a cpm criterion caused a drastic reduction in the transcriptomic basis that was made available for de analyses. in our case, cpm filtering excluded almost 42 % of the original transcripts, most of which were low-count transcripts. filtering by cpm criterion was originally designed to remove transcripts considered challenging for inference due to shortage of available information  <cit> . however, we showed that cpm-based filtering also excluded from the data all transcripts expressed in only one of the bluestem subspecies and absent in the other , which were of particular interest to researchers in the motivating data application. filtering out these transcripts excludes them from any follow-up de consideration, which may in turn impair understanding of the transcriptomic basis for phenotypic differences between bluestem subspecies and misinform further exploration of candidate genes. moreover, cpm-based filtering also reduced both the total number and the proportion of transcripts called de relative to no filtering, whereas little gain was obtained in uniquely identified de-declared transcripts . taken together, our results indicate that the implications of data filtering for de inference should not be taken lightly, as the effect seems to depend, and disproportionally so, on the specifics of the data exclusion criterion as well as on the types of transcript of interest. on a more general note, data exclusion based on cpm filtering may have even more serious implications for inference on transcription factors, which have low expression levels despite their key role as master switches that regulate gene expression  <cit> .

overall, the rationale for arbitrary filtering rna-seq data based on either a rp criterion or a cpm criterion seems poorly justified, either biologically or otherwise, particularly given the availability of powerful state-of-the-art statistical methodology developed to deal with the associated challenges in rna-seq data. instead, researchers may consider using the complete unfiltered rna-seq data for de analyses, ensuring use of modern statistical methods to properly borrow information across transcripts and moderate  de inference based on expression levels. in particular, deseq <dig> and edger robust have shown promising inferential performance in handling low-count transcripts with minimal effect on the de analysis for the remaining transcripts. further, forgoing the use of data filtering at arbitrary thresholds in favor of more elegant approaches to deal with the inherent challenges of rna-seq data may be particularly relevant for research questions focused on biologically relevant transcripts characterized by low expression levels, such as transcription factors.

finally, it is of concern that differential expression assessments for low-count transcripts based on the wald test implemented by default in deseq <dig> yielded more liberal results relative to those based on a likelihood ratio test. both tests assume that certain regularity conditions hold, though such conditions are rarely verified in practice  <cit> . it is further concerning that the performance of these approximate tests is known to deteriorate rapidly in situations of limited information, and apparently more so for wald tests  <cit> . both tests implemented by deseq <dig> constitute approximations that may require careful attention and detailed consideration of the assumptions made on a case-by-case basis, in order to ensure sound inference and prevent inflation of type i error.

CONCLUSIONS
we implemented a recently adapted plasmode-based approach to compare inferential performance of modern statistical methods, namely deseq <dig> and edger robust, on rna-seq data. motivated by interest on a transcriptomic comparison of bluestem grass species, we pay special attention to transcripts of low expression levels, defined here as low-count transcripts. we emphasize that implications of these results may be relevant to other biological applications that involve transcripts of high biological importance but low expression levels, such as transcription factors. both deseq <dig> and edger robust seemed to properly control family-wise type  <dig> error on all transcripts as well as on low-count transcripts. for low-count transcripts, edger robust showed greater power whereas deseq <dig> showed greater precision and accuracy. overall, both methods showed promising inferential performance on low-count transcripts and yielded a substantial amount of overlap in de calling, thus supporting their combined use for fine-tuned de inference. still, a note of caution is in order regarding the approximate nature of de tests on individual transcripts, particularly low-count ones.

regarding edger robust, the specification of a degree of freedom parameter was found to be non-trivial. this is to be expected as degrees of freedom determine the amount of shrinkage and borrowing of information across transcripts, thereby impacting precision and accuracy of de inference. our results raise legitimate questions about the use of a default value for the degree of freedom hyperparameter, recognizing that a default value may not be appropriate for all datasets, as it was certainly not optimal in our case study. the edger robust degrees of freedom parameter should thus be given careful consideration in any data application and, whenever possible, it should be estimated from the data.

finally, our results support that filtering of rna-seq data can have serious implications for inference as mostly low-count transcripts are removed from the data and excluded from de analyses. standard rna-seq data management pipelines that call for filtering transcripts out at arbitrary thresholds should be reconsidered. instead, researchers may implement modern state-of-the-art statistical methodologies specifically developed to deal directly with the inherent challenges of rna-seq data, including transcripts of low expression levels.
