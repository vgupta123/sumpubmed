BACKGROUND
sinorhizobium meliloti is a soil-born α-proteobacterium that can enter a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with medicago sativa  and related legumes. the establishment of the symbiosis relies on a complex molecular dialogue between the two partners that triggers two essential and overlapping steps, nodulation and infection . during the infection process, bacteria colonize root hairs forming infection threads  that extend and proliferate towards the nodule primordium that is formed in the root cortex. ultimately, rhizobia are released from its within nodule cells where they fix molecular dinitrogen. nodulation and infection are tightly controlled processes and we have shown recently that bacterial adenylate cyclases  contribute to the negative autoregulation of infection  <cit> .

acs  are enzymes that synthesize camp  from atp. there are  <dig> non-homologous classes of acs as a typical example of convergent evolution  <cit> . class iii is the universal class whose members can be found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes although, to our knowledge, their presence in plants has not been established  <cit> . the number of class iii acs strikingly varies in bacteria. e. coli has none whereas cyanobacteria, mycobacteria and rhizobia, a group of phylogenetically-diverse bacteria  <cit> , have many, up to  <dig> in the soybean symbiont bradyrhizobium japonicum. the biological function of class iii acs in bacteria remains poorly understood. class iii acs synthesize camp in response to environmental cues such as light, oxygen, nitrogen and ph in cyanobacteria  <cit>  or high osmotic pressure in myxococcus xanthus <cit> . class iii acs are also involved in biotic interactions as they contribute to virulence in m. tuberculosis, p. aeruginosa and in some fungal pathogens  <cit> . co <dig> and ca2+ are signals used by pathogens to sense their host environment through their ac–camp signaling systems. candida albicans and mycobacteria express co2-responsive acs  <cit>  whereas cyab from p. aeruginosa is ca2+ sensitive. another example of camp-associated signal being used by the human fungal pathogen c. albicans to sense the host environment is the bacterial peptidoglycan present in blood serum  <cit> .

we have recently described the first instance of class iii acs contributing to a symbiotic  interaction, between sinorhizobium meliloti and its host plant medicago sativa <cit> . s. meliloti has  <dig> class iii acs of overall unknown biological functions with a variety of domain organization  <cit> . in response to a plant signal present in nodules, three receptor-like adenylate cyclases cyad <dig>  cyad <dig> and cyak synthesize the secondary messenger molecule 3′, 5′camp. 3′, 5′camp together with the crp-like transcriptional activator clr in turn promote transcription of the target gene smc <dig>  of unknown biochemical function  <cit> . we have recently found that this cascade contributes to the autoregulation of the symbiotic interaction. specifically, activation of the camp cascade in nodules inhibits, by a mechanism that remains to be elucidated, secondary infection by rhizospheric bacteria. this control is lost in either a triple cyad1cyad2cyak mutant, a clr or a smc <dig> mutant resulting in a hyper-infection phenotype on plants–ie an abundance of abortive its on roots–as a consequence of a relaxed control of secondary infection  <cit> .

the concentration of the second messenger 3′, 5′camp in cells is controlled at the level of its synthesis by acs and/or by its degradation to 5′amp by phosphodiesterases . pdes are a superfamily of enzymes divided in three, non-homologous, main classes. all mammalian pdes as well as several enzymes identified in drosophila, caenorhabditis and saccharomyces cerevisiae belong to class i, whose conserved carboxy-terminal catalytic domain contains two invariant motifs h3h25-35d/e  <cit> . class ii pdes are enzymes from saccharomyces cerevisiae, dictyostelium discoideum, schizosaccharomyces pombe, c. albicans, and vibrio fischeri <cit> . this class of enzymes shares the conserved motif hxhldh. class iii pdes belong to the superfamily of metallophosphoesterases  <cit> . they share the conserved sequence motif d-n-gdn-gnh-n-h-n-ghxh as well as a βαβαβ secondary structure signature  <cit> .

here we report on the characterization of a class iii pde from s. meliloti  that we anticipated from the localization of the spda gene at the cyad <dig> locus to be involved in signal termination by turning-over the secondary messenger 3′, 5′camp. we have found that purified spda had actually no detectable activity against 3′, 5′camp and, instead, had high activity on the structural isomer 2′, 3′camp, which may occur in cells as a by-product of rna degradation  <cit> . we demonstrated that, contrary to 3′, 5′camp that promoted clr binding to a cognate binding-site, 2′, 3′camp bound unproductively to clr. although spda biological function remains to be established, we present circumstantial evidence that spda may insulate 3′, 5′camp-mediated signaling from 2′, 3′-structural isomers.

RESULTS
spda, a putative pde
inspection of the cyad <dig> locus , that contains the clr gene as well as the clr–target gene smc <dig>  pointed to the smc <dig> gene product as a potential pde that we subsequently coined spda. spda belongs to a 15-member protein family sharing the ipr <dig> domain characteristic of a wide range of metallophosphoesterases, among which phosphorine phosphatases, nucleotidases, and class iii pdes. we thus compared spda as well as the  <dig> other ipr004843-containing proteins to known pdes from mycobacterium tuberculosis , haemophilus influenzae  and escherichia coli   <cit> .

overall analysis of the whole protein family indicated no clear phylogenetic relationship between the family members besides the fact that smc <dig> and smc <dig> behaved as an outgroup together with cpdb, a periplasmic 2′, 3′ camp-pde from e. coli . spda closest homologue was m. tuberculosis rv <dig> and indeed closer sequence inspection indicated that spda contained the  <dig> sub-domains characteristic of rv <dig> and other class iii pdes  <cit>   whereas all other s. meliloti proteins, except smc <dig>  had fewer . spda had a predicted cytoplasmic location and missed the amino-terminal 200-aminoacid membrane anchoring domain of rv <dig>  <cit> .

spda is expressed in planta, independently of clr and 3’, 5’camp
we probed expression of a translational spda-lacz fusion  that contained the intergenic region between smc <dig> and spda  as well as the first  <dig> codons of spda. the spda-lacz fusion did not detectably express ex planta and instead expressed in medicago sativa nodules with the same pattern as smc <dig> <cit> i.e. expression in young nodule primordia and in zones ii and iii of mature nodules . however, spda expression in planta was independent of clr, and ex planta expression could not be induced by exogenous 3′, 5′camp, in contrast to smc <dig> expression . none of the environmental conditions or compounds which we have tested was able to stimulate spda expression ex planta, including 3′, 5′cgmp, 2′, 3′camp, 5′amp, nodule extracts, root exudates or several growth and stress conditions .

altogether these results indicated that spda was expressed in planta from its own promoter and had the same expression pattern as smc <dig> although the two genes were not co-regulated.

spda is a 2′, 3′cnmp pde
we purified the spda protein as a carboxy-terminal his6-tagged fusion . under non-denaturing electrophoretic conditions the protein migrated as a monomer. purified his6-spda protein displayed activity against the generic pde substrate bispnpp in vitro . spda had little or no activity against either 3′, 5′camp or 3′, 5′cgmp but significantly hydrolyzed the positional isomers 2′, 3′camp and 2′, 3′cgmp  which are products of rna degradation  <cit> . the km for 2′, 3′camp was  <dig>  mm and kcat was 2 s- <dig> indicating a slow enzyme with low affinity for its substrate in vitro . we observed no inhibition of the enzyme by its substrate and found that 3′, 5′camp did not affect spda activity on 2′, 3′camp.

despite ipr004843-containing proteins being documented metalloenzymes, the metal chelators edta, 1-10-phenanthroline and bipyridyl, or the addition of fe2+ or mn2+ metal ions, had no effect on spda activity . mass spectrometry of isolated spda confirmed the absence of associated metal including mg2+, mn2+ and co2+ together with the monomeric state of the protein. indeed, a well resolved single mass peak corresponding to the monomer was observed after max-ent deconvolution of the spectra.

2′, 3′camp binds unproductively to clr
in order to investigate a possible interference of 2′, 3′cyclic nucleotides with 3′, 5′ camp-signaling we assessed the capacity of 2′, 3′camp and 3′, 5′camp to bind clr in vitro. for this purpose, we purified a gst-tagged version of clr by affinity purification . purified clr protein was loaded onto a 3′, 5′camp-agarose column. bound clr protein was then eluted with either the cognate 3′, 5′camp nucleotide or its 2′, 3′ isomer . both nucleotides displaced agarose-bound clr thus suggesting that clr could bind 3′, 5′camp and 2′, 3′camp at the same binding site .

clr is a predicted transcriptional activator of the crp family  <cit> . inspection of the smc <dig> promoter region pointed to a short palindromic sequence  centered ca. 68 bp upstream of the predicted start codon that was a potential binding site for clr. accordingly, deletion of this motif abolished activation of the smc <dig> promoter by clr in the presence of exogenously provided 3′, 5′camp . in order to directly assess whether this motif was a binding site for the clr protein, we tested the ability of purified clr-gst to bind dna oligomers  bracketing the putative clr-binding motif  or a mutated version . we found that clr induced a retard in oligomer migration that was strictly dependent on the presence of 3′, 5′camp, of an intact clr-box and was clr concentration-dependent. however, no clear shifted band was observed, irrespectively of the binding and gel electrophoresis conditions tested, which probably reflected dissociation of the clr/camp/dna complex. nevertheless we interpreted this as evidence that clr bound the predicted clr-box in a 3′, 5′camp-dependent manner. 2′, 3′camp was unable to promote clr binding to the clr-box, at the same concentration as 3′, 5′camp. mixed incubation of the two nucleotides  with clr in vitro showed no detectable effect of 2′, 3′camp on dna-binding by clr .

we tested the impact of exogenously provided 2′, 3′camp on smc <dig> expression in vivo under different experimental conditions. exogenous 2′, 3′camp alone was unable to promote activation of the smc02178-lacz reporter fusion in vivo, even at high  concentration . in contrast 2′, 3′camp had a negative impact on 3′, 5′camp-driven smc <dig> expression. inhibition reached 50%  when 3′, 5′camp was produced endogenously, as in normal physiological conditions, upon addition to the bacterial culture of a medicago shoot extract containing the plant signal that triggers activity of the cyad1cyad2cyak acs  <cit> . inhibition was only 30% when 3′, 5′ camp was provided exogenously . noteworthy, the negative impact of 2′, 3′camp was not observed on a constitutive hema-lacz reporter fusion  suggesting a specific effect of 2′, 3′camp on 3′, 5′camp-mediated signaling.

biological characterization of a s. meliloti spda null mutant
as to get an insight into spda biological function we inactivated the corresponding gene by cre-lox deletion  <cit> . spda inactivation decreased smc02178-lacz expression by ca. 25% in the presence of plant shoot extracts, supposedly by increasing endogenous 2′, 3′cnmp concentration in vivo. combining spda inactivation together with exogenous 2′, 3′camp addition decreased smc <dig> expression to 40% of wild-type .

the spda mutant had the same growth characteristics as wild-type both in rich complex medium  and in synthetic vincent medium with mannitol and glutamate  as carbon and nitrogen sources . we observed that exogenous 2′, 3′camp extended bacterial growth in vgm medium, suggesting that s. meliloti can grow by utilizing 2′, 3′camp, as yersinia does  <cit> . however the spda mutant did not differ from wild-type in this respect. the spda mutant also responded similarly to wild-type to various stress conditions including detergent  and heat shock .

spda inactivation had no detectable effect on symbiotic performances, including nodulation, infection and nitrogen fixation , on medicago sativa nor on the level or pattern of smc <dig> symbiotic expression in planta .

hence we did not detect any phenotype associated with the spda mutation besides its limited effect on 3’, 5’ camp-signaling.

discussion
clr is a 3′, 5′cnmp-dependent dna-binding transcriptional activator
the findings reported here give experimental support and extend the model proposed by  <cit> , as we demonstrated that clr binds to the smc <dig> promoter region at a specific site in a 3′, 5′camp-dependent manner. the transcription start site  at the smc <dig> promoter was not determined experimentally here. however a single smc <dig> tss was mapped in the closely related strain  <dig> by rna-sequencing of a pool of bacteria living in  <dig> different free-living and stress conditions  <cit> . the tss mapped  <dig>  bp downstream of the center of the clr-box which is the distance typically found in class i crp-dependent promoters. in class i promoters, a single protein–protein interaction with cap facilitates the binding of rna-polymerase to the promoter to yield the rna-polymerase–promoter closed complex  <cit> .

one salient feature of clr binding at the smc <dig> promoter dna was instability. in spite of the many binding and electrophoresis conditions tested, we consistently observed a smear instead of a clear-cut band shift upon binding of clr to its target dna. one feature that may account for this instability is that the clr binding site is tgttn8aaca, a shorter palindrome as compared to the consensus e. coli crp-binding site tgtgan6tcaca. identification of this binding motif, together with transcriptome analysis experiments, will help identification of new clr targets in the s. meliloti genome.

the reason for which 2′, 3′camp did not promote dna-binding of clr is unclear. although clr bound 2′, 3′camp in vitro at high concentration , it may not do so at the concentration of 2′, 3′camp that we used in emsa assays . alternatively, 2′, 3′camp may not trigger the appropriate conformational change that allows crp binding to dna. further experiments are needed to distinguish between these two possibilities.

spda encodes a 2′, 3′cnmp phosphodiesterase
class iii pdes are metallophosphoesterases carrying the ipr <dig> domain. ipr004843-containing proteins have a wide range of substrates, including cyclic nucleotides, and ensure a variety of biological functions  <cit> . s. meliloti has  <dig> uncharacterized ipr004843-containing proteins  and we have demonstrated that purified spda has a pde activity in vitro .

we have further found that spda had no or little activity against 3′, 5′camp or 3′, 5′cgmp and instead had high activity against 2′, 3′camp or 2′, 3′cgmp. although this cannot be formally excluded it is unlikely that spda would have a predominant 3′, 5′camp pde activity in vivo since a spda null mutant had lower, and not enhanced, smc <dig> expression in vivo .

substrate specificity varies widely among class iii pdes. cpda from e. coli and p. aeruginosa, icc from haemophilus influenzae are 3′, 5′cnmp pdes  <cit>  whereas e. coli cpdb was the first described 2′, 3′cnmp-specific pde  <cit> . rv <dig> from m. tuberculosis, although it was first reported as a 3′, 5′cnmp pde  <cit> , has a much stronger activity  against 2′, 3′cnmp than against 3′, 5′cnmp  <cit> . myxococcus xanthus pdea and pdeb instead hydrolyse 2′, 3′cnmp and 3′, 5′cnmp with the same affinity  <cit> . hence class iii pdes substrate specificity cannot be predicted from simple primary sequence inspection. it is thus possible that several ipr <dig> proteins of s. meliloti display a 2′, 3′cyclic phosphodiesterase activity, thus contributing a functional redundancy.

a surprising feature of spda was the absence of associated metal ion which is, to our knowledge, unique among ipr004843-containing proteins. rv <dig> activity for example was not inhibited by metal chelators but was boosted by mn2+ addition  <cit> . however, it has been already reported that the ipgm protein from castor bean that belongs to a superfamily of metalloenzymes  <cit>  was actually metal-independent  <cit> . moreover, the carboxy-terminal hd domain of the e. coli trna nucleotidyltransferase has a metal-independent phosphodiesterase activity toward 2′, 3′camp  <cit> . thus, the fact that spda displays metal-independent 2′, 3′cnmp-phosphodiesterase activity is not completely unprecedented. mass spectrometric measurements performed under mild ionization conditions also pointed out that the well-defined monomeric form of the protein did not present any demetallation.

the 2′, 3′cnmp substrate specificity of spda leaves the question of 3′, 5′camp turnover intact. one option would be to identify a 3′, 5′cnmp pde among the  <dig> other s. meliloti proteins containing the ipr <dig> domain. another, non-exclusive, possibility would be a regulation of 3′, 5′camp homeostasis by secretion rather than by degradation  <cit> .

possible biological functions for spda
very little is known about the origin, role and fate of 2′, 3′cyclic nucleotides. one documented origin is rna degradation and physiological or stressful conditions may indeed lead 2′, 3′cnmps to accumulate in bacteria. we are not aware of any other origin such as, for example, isomerization of corresponding 3’, 5’ cyclic nucleotides. in this context, spda may serve at least three different, non-exclusive, functions: a metabolic function, a detoxifying function and a role in preventing cross talk with 3′, 5′camp signaling.

although s. meliloti likely metabolized exogenous 2′, 3′camp , spda was not critical for this since the mutant grew indistinctly from wild-type under these conditions.

2′, 3′camp was recently reported to be a toxic compound in kidney cells, that opens mitochondria permeability transition pores thus leading to a pre-apoptotic and necrotic stage  <cit> . we thus considered whether spda may counteract a toxic effect of 2′, 3′cnmps in s. meliloti. however the unaltered growth characteristics of the spda mutant as compared to wild-type in various growth  and stress conditions  did not give support to this possibility.

a third possibility would be spda preventing cross-talk between 2′, 3′cyclic nucleotides and 3′, 5′camp signaling. several lines of evidence are in favor of this possibility:  the evolutionary-conserved physical location of spda in close proximity to cyad <dig>  clr and the target gene smc <dig> in all the sequenced strains of sinorhizobium meliloti, sinorhizobium saheli and sinorhizobium fredii ;  <cit>   spda expression in nodules at the same place where 3′, 5′camp signaling takes places  <cit>  and where a massive rna degradation occurs as part of the reorientation of the bacteroid transcriptome to the goal of nitrogen fixation  <cit>   a significant and specific decrease in smc <dig> expression upon providing exogenous 2′, 3′camp  the spurious interaction of 2′, 3′camp with clr.

whatever spda function, the high km value measured in vitro for the 2′, 3′camp substrate  would imply that the cyclic nucleotide accumulates in high amounts in bacteroids, unless specific physiological or biochemical conditions lower km value in vivo. developing methods for direct measurements of 2′, 3′cnmp levels in bacteroids, where spda preferentially expresses, is now needed to clarify this issue. a ribonucleic origin for 2′, 3′camp/cgmp would make sense physiologically given the extensive transcriptome reprofiling taking place in bacteroids  <cit>  and the abundance of vapc-type ribonucleases in s. meliloti genome  <cit> . intriguingly, the human intracellular pathogen m. tuberculosis shares with s. meliloti, despite the large phylogenetic distance separating them, a wealth of acs, a clr-like transcriptional regulator as well as a close homolog of spda, rv <dig>  rv <dig>  like spda, has a preferential activity–and similar km value-towards 2′, 3′ cyclic nucleotides  <cit>  and contributes to overall bacterial virulence on macrophages, by a still obscure mechanism  <cit> . interestingly, m. tuberculosis and s. meliloti have in commun a high number of vapc-type rnases of the vapc-toxin  family  <cit> . altogether this suggests the intriguing possibility that spda, rv <dig> and other cytoplasmic pdes may constitute a physiological adaptation in bacteria with a high rna turnover, possibly in relationship with 3′, 5′camp-mediated signaling.

CONCLUSIONS
signal transduction in bacteria is dominated by two-component regulatory systems  <cit> . however, some bacteria, including important pathogens and symbionts, use cyclic or dicyclic nucleotide signaling for modulating interaction with their abiotic or biotic environment  <cit> . characterization of enzymes and mechanisms that synthesize and degrade secondary messenger molecules, restrict their diffusion within the cell and prevent cross-talking by diffusible isomers, is needed for fully understanding cyclic nucleotide signaling. in the context of characterizing 3′, 5′camp-mediated signaling in the s. meliloti-medicago symbiosis, we have identified a plant-expressed 2′, 3′camp/cgmp specific phosphodiesterase whose biological function remains to be elucidated. circumstantial evidence suggests that one spda function could be to insulate 3′, 5′camp-based signaling from 2′, 3′ cyclic nucleotides of metabolic origin.
