BACKGROUND
human tonsils are a rich source of b lymphocytes exhibiting a variety of phenotypes and activation states. a well-established method for enriching b lymphocytes from tonsils involves the addition of 2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide  modified sheep red blood cells  to deplete t lymphocytes by rosetting  <cit> . this is a relatively inefficient method, requiring advance acquisition and treatment of sheep rbcs, and several time-consuming steps on the day of cell separation. additionally, while this method results in significant enrichment of b lymphocytes, there is often up to 8% contaminating t cells  <cit> . magnetic cell separation techniques can yield highly purified populations of either negatively or positively selected b lymphocytes, but the high cost of reagents can be prohibitive when isolating very large numbers of cells.

in this study we describe a rapid and cost-effective approach for purifying large numbers of b lymphocytes from tonsils using a commercially available reagent, rosettesep, which was designed for purifying cells from whole blood. the rosettesep human b cell enrichment cocktail consists of tetrameric antibody complexes with specificities for cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd66b, and glycophorin-a. addition of this antibody cocktail to whole blood results in crosslinking of unwanted cells with multiple rbcs to form immunorosettes that pellet when centrifuged over a lymphocyte separation density medium, while b lymphocytes collect at the interphase. this technique relies on the presence of the large excess of rbcs in whole blood for the formation of immunorosettes. single cell suspensions from tonsils contain relatively few rbcs. here, we show that by addition of human but not sheep rbcs to tonsil cell suspensions, rosettesep can be used to rapidly obtain large numbers of highly purified b cells.

RESULTS
removal of lymphocytes from donor rbcs
we proposed to add allogeneic human rbcs to unfractionated tonsil cell suspensions in order to optimize the use of rosettesep for b cell isolation from tonsils. first, it was necessary to consider potential contamination of the final product with b lymphocytes from the whole blood used to obtain rbcs. in healthy individuals white blood cells make up  <dig> – <dig> % of cells in the blood; b lymphocytes comprise 5–25% of this fraction, depending on the age of the donor  <cit> . given the large excess of rbcs to be added to unfractionated tonsil cells, the use of human blood as a source of rbcs could result in significant contamination with non-tonsil b lymphocytes. in order to avoid contaminating tonsil b lymphocytes with allogeneic blood b lymphocytes during the purification, we first depleted mononuclear cells from the rbcs by centrifugation over lymphocyte separation medium. as expected, the mononuclear cells removed from whole blood were largely cd <dig> or cd <dig> positive as determined by flow cytometery . a more sensitive measure, reverse-transcription pcr, was used to detect t and b cells in the rbc preparation before and after depletion . pcr products for both cd <dig> and cd <dig> were detected in samples of whole blood and the mononuclear cell fraction. the purified rbc preparation showed no cd <dig> or cd <dig> pcr product, indicating that it was free of lymphocyte contamination.

isolation of tonsil b lymphocytes using rosettesep
tonsil lymphocyte suspensions include 40–80% b lymphocytes, with t lymphocytes comprising the bulk of the remaining cells. figure  <dig> shows a typical purification of b lymphocytes from tonsils using rosettesep. in the unpurified tonsil cell suspension shown, there were  <dig> % b cells and  <dig> % t cells . rosettesep purification of b lymphocytes without the addition of rbcs resulted in approximately  <dig> % purity with 6% t cell contamination . addition of human rbcs improved the purification to  <dig> %, reducing the amount of t cell contamination to 1% .

sheep rbcs have been used for tonsil b lymphocyte isolation by rosettesep  <cit> . however, we found that the addition of sheep rbcs provided no improvement in b lymphocyte purity over that obtained without added rbcs . additionally, we found that tonsil b cells purified with either sheep rbcs or no added rbcs gave a reproducible pcr product for cd <dig> after  <dig> cycles, whereas there was no evidence of cd <dig> in tonsil b lymphocytes purified with human rbcs .

to assess cell loss during this procedure, we determined the percent of cd19+ lymphocytes in unfractionated tonsil cell suspensions using flow cytometry. after purification, the total number of recovered b cells was determined and expressed as a percentage of the estimated input number. it was found that this method of b lymphocyte purification reproducibly yielded greater than 99% recovery.

to further assess the utility of this method, the b lymphocyte phenotypes were examined before and after purification, using flow cytometry to detect cd <dig>  cd <dig> and igd. unpurified tonsil lymphocytes were gated on cd <dig> expression before examining the cd38/igd profile . rosettesep with the addition of human rbcs resulted in a 99% pure population of b-lymphocytes with a cd38/igd profile similar to that of the corresponding tonsil cells, suggesting that all b lymphocyte populations are preserved during purification .

discussion
we describe in this report the application of rosettesep for isolation of tonsil b lymphocytes to very high purity. significant enrichment can be obtained using rosettesep without the addition of rbcs , the degree of purity depending on the extent of rbc contamination of the starting tonsil cell suspension . however, the addition of excess human rbcs was found to be essential for reproducibly obtaining b cell purity above 98%; sheep rbcs could not be substituted likely owing to species specificity of the anti-glycophorin-a antibody in the rosettesep cocktail.

potential contamination with blood b cells from the rbc donor was eliminated by depletion of mononuclear cells from the rbc preparation; rbcs could then be stored for several weeks without significant hemolysis. the rosettesep method with added human rbcs represents a significant improvement over current methods . compared to the aet-treated sheep rbcs method, there are significant time savings in the purification procedure as well as in the rbc preparation; the stability of stored human rbcs compared to aet-treated sheep rbcs is a further advantage. purification using immunomagnetic beads is equally efficient, however, rosettesep is less than 10% of the cost for purification of an equal number of b lymphocytes. thus we recommend the use of this modified rosettesep technique for obtaining any number of highly purified tonsil b lymphocytes.

CONCLUSIONS
rosettesep can be used in combination with allogeneic human rbcs to reproducibly isolate tonsil b lymphocytes to high levels of purity with no change in phenotype or loss of cells. this method provides considerable time and cost savings compared to other methods.
