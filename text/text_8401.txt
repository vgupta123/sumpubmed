BACKGROUND
recurrence of highly pathogenic avian influenza  virus subtype h <dig> in humans and poultry continues to be a serious concern to public health. before  <dig>  only occasional case reports of human h <dig> influenza virus infections occurred as a result of direct animal-to-human transmission or laboratory accidents and most of these infections resulted in conjunctivitis and/or mild influenza-like illness  <cit> . in  <dig>  an hpai h7n <dig> outbreak in the netherlands infected  <dig> people who were in close contact with affected poultry, including one fatal case, and led to the culling of over  <dig> million birds  <cit> . the most recent outbreak of h7n <dig> strains in china resulted in more than  <dig> human cases, including  <dig> deaths, making h <dig> subtype hpai viruses the focus of public attention  <cit> . who has listed hpai h7n <dig> as one of the most lethal viral pathogens  <cit> . most of the infected patients had a history of poultry contact, indicating the transmission from poultry to human. the scale of poultry outbreaks and its association with cases of human infection with h <dig> viruses highlights the need for efficient diagnosis and continued surveillance of this virus subtype  <cit> .

conventional laboratory methods for influenza virus detection include virus isolation in embryonated eggs or madin-darby canine kidney  cells, followed by subsequent ha subtype identification using serological methods. molecular detection methods such as real-time pcr assays have been widely applied for the laboratory diagnosis of influenza infections  <cit>  and ha subtype identification  <cit> . however, both conventional and laboratory methods are technically demanding and are not suitable for on-site use in field investigations. the development of rapid h <dig> subtype influenza virus detection tests in dot elisa   <cit> , ac-elisa , and chromatographic strip formats  <cit>  using h <dig> monoclonal antibodies  is hence preferred.

serological investigations to detect specific antibodies from h <dig> infection in poultry and humans are critical to the success of disease prevention and control programs. however, due to the lack of a specific and sensitive monoclonal antibody, there are no serologic tests available against h <dig> aiv. microneutralization is currently used as the “gold standard” for subtyping. however, the test is labor-intensive and its sensitivity is limited, rendering it impractical for rapid and high-throughput diagnostics. the hi test and indirect elisa are considered to be simple serology tests. however, low sensitivity and subtype cross-reactivity significantly limit the value of these assays  <cit> . competitive elisas , also called epitope blocking elisas, are widely used for serological detection of antibodies to influenza viruses  <cit> , mainly due to their sensitivity and simplicity. the celisa makes it possible to provide general assays for testing sera from different avian species, humans, and other species without changing any of the test reagents  <cit> .

it is a challenge to combine ac-elisa and celisa on the same plate with the same amount of antibodies. the selected mabs are required to target conserved antigenic epitopes and compete to host antibodies in infected sera for the epitope binding. in this study, two h <dig> mabs were identified to meet these requirements and assembled in a dual-function-elisa for universal h <dig> diagnosis via either antigen or antibody detection. the sensitivity and specificity for both functions were evaluated. the results indicated that for the first time, antigen and antibody detection could be performed with the same device and mabs for specific and sensitive h <dig> aiv detection.

production and characterization of mab
balb/c mice were immunized twice subcutaneously at intervals of 2 weeks with bei  inactivated h7n <dig>  and adjuvant . mice were boosted with the same viral antigen, 3 days before the fusion of splenocytes with sp2/ <dig> cells  <cit> . the fused cells were seeded in 96-well plates, and their supernatants were screened by immunofluorescence assays as described below. the hybridomas that produced the mabs were cloned by limiting dilution at least three times. the positive mabs were tested for their hemagglutination inhibition activity as described below. immunoglobulins from selected positive mabs were isotyped using a commercial isotyping kit  as described in the manufacturer’s protocol. the hybridoma suspension was harvested 3 days postseeding and cell debris pelleted by centrifugation at 400 g for 10 min, followed by collection of the supernatant and storage at -20°c. mabs were purified with montage kit prosep-g  for igg.

experimental serum samples
inactivated ai viruses  were emulsified in isa- <dig>  adjuvant and injected intramuscularly to the groups of three weeks old white leghorn chickens . the booster was given twice at two-week intervals. sera were prepared from the blood collected 10 days after 1st injection and 2nd injection. antibody responses to the homologous strains were evaluated by hi as described below. groups of mice  were injected intramuscularly with different inactivated h <dig> aivs  individually emulsified in adjuvant . the injections were repeated twice at two-week intervals. in addition, guinea pigs were immunized with inactivated h7n <dig> . blood was collected 14 days after the 2nd immunization.

hemagglutination inhibition assay
hemagglutination inhibition  assays were performed as described previously  <cit> . briefly, mabs were serially diluted  in v-bottom 96-well plates and mixed with  <dig> ha units of h <dig> virus. plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and 1% chicken rbcs were added to each well. the hemagglutination inhibition endpoint was the highest mab dilution in which agglutination was not observed.

isolation and analysis of escape mutants
the epitope recognized by mab  <dig> was mapped by characterization of escape mutants as described previously  <cit> . briefly, h7n <dig> parental viruses were incubated with an excess of mab for 1 h and then inoculated into 11 day old embryonated chicken eggs. the eggs were incubated at 37°c for 48 h. virus was harvested and used for cloning in limiting dilution in embryonated chicken eggs and the escape mutants were plaque purified. the ha gene mutations were then identified by sequencing and comparison with the sequence of the parental virus.

microneutralization assay
neutralization activity of mab against h <dig> strains was analyzed by microneutralization assay as previously described  <cit> . briefly, mab was serially two-fold diluted and incubated with  <dig> tcid <dig> of different clades of h <dig> strains for 1 h at room temperature and plated in duplicate onto mdck cells grown in a 96-well plate. the neutralizing titer was assessed as the highest mab dilution in which no cytopathic effect was observed by light microscopy.

h <dig> baculovirus production
the recombinant baculovirus vector was generated as described previously  <cit> . the full length ha gene was amplified from h7n <dig>  reassortant virus in a standard pcr reaction. the amplified ha gene was inserted into the shuttle vector pfastbacht a  for expression under the white spot syndrome virus  immediate early  promotor. this expression cassette was integrated into the baculovirus genome within dh10bactm  through site specific transposition according to the protocol of the bac-to-bac system . sf9ii cells were maintained in sf900ii serum free medium  at 28°c for recombinant baculovirus synthesis. the recombinant bacmid was then transfected into sf9ii cells and the supernatant containing recombinant baculovirus displayed h7-ha  was harvested at 96 h post-infection.

dual-function-elisa
96-well, round-bottom microtiter plates  were coated with  <dig>  ug/well of capture mab  <dig> in  <dig> ul of carbonate buffer  overnight at 4°c or 37°c for 2 h. the plates were washed twice with pbst, followed by two washes with pbs after each incubation with antibody or antigen. the antibody-coated plates were blocked by incubation with  <dig> ul of blocking buffer  for 1 h at room temperature. for antigen detection, the blocked plates were then incubated at 37°c for 1 h with  <dig> ul of virus-containing samples diluted in pbst. for antibody detection,  <dig> ul of serum samples mixed with  <dig> ul of h <dig> surface expressing baculovirus of  <dig> hau were added to the blocked plates for 1-hour-incubation at 37°c. virus binding or antibody blocking was detected by incubation for 1 h at 37°c with  <dig> ul of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated detection mab  <dig>  . chromogen development was mediated by the addition of  <dig> ul of freshly prepared substrate solution . the reaction was stopped with sulfuric acid of  <dig>  n, and the optical density at 490 nm was recorded. the antigen detection limit was determined by the optical density value that gave a signal-to-noise ratio of  <dig>  for antibody detection, the od intensity reduction caused by serum antibodies blocking mab binding was calculated for each sample dilution by using the formula: % inhibition = ×100%. to determine the cut-off value of antibody detection, specific pathogen-free chicken sera, mice and guinea pigs were obtained from the animal health biotechnology serum bank, temasek life sciences laboratory, singapore.

RESULTS
mab  <dig> and  <dig> recognize conserved neutralizing epitopes on h <dig> aivs
a panel of mabs against influenza hemagglutinin was screened for efficient recognition of different strains of h <dig> viruses. based on the results of the hi assay and virus neutralization , mab  <dig> and  <dig> were selected for further studies due to their high hi activity against a wide range of h <dig> viruses from birds and humans, including strains from the recent h7n <dig> outbreak in eastern china. both the mabs belong to the igg <dig> isotype. the virus neutralizing activity of mab  <dig> and  <dig> was further confirmed to be positive against h <dig> aivs. based on this, the amino acids involved in forming the epitope of mab  <dig> and  <dig> were analyzed using selection of neutralization escape mutants. a/chicken/malaysia/ <dig> h7n <dig> virus was used as parental virus for the selection. sequences of the complete ha genes isolated from multiple escape variants were compared with the parental virus. it was found that mutants generated with mab  <dig> have a single mutation on amino acid  <dig> from lysine to glutamate. mab  <dig> carried mutations either at amino acid  <dig> , or  <dig> . the numbering of amino acid on ha starts from “atg” and includes the signal peptide.

in order to determine the significance of the neutralization epitopes of mab  <dig> and  <dig>  the protein polymorphism of h <dig> was studied , taking into account all h <dig> sequences in the ncbi database. on the 175th amino acid, lysine and asparagine appear in more than  <dig> % of h <dig> aiv strains listed. lysine is the most dominant amino acid with the frequency of  <dig> % among avian h <dig> strains and 100% among human h7s. on the 136th amino acid, serine exists in  <dig> % of avian strains and 100% of human h <dig> strains, while glycine on the 137th amino acid exists in  <dig> % of avian h <dig> and 100% of human strains. this finding indicates that the two mabs are able to recognize or neutralize all the h <dig> human strain identified so far, suggesting their potential for universal h <dig> aiv detection.

development of the dual-function-elisa
the dual-function-elisa was operated as shown in figure  <dig>  h <dig> antigen can be detected in an ac-elisa based on h <dig> specific mabs. mab  <dig> was randomly selected as the detector antibody and mab  <dig> was used as the capture antibody due to their equivalent performance in the reversible use in h <dig> ac-elisa. optimal concentrations of mabs  <dig> and  <dig> for detection and capture were determined by two-way titration of mab concentrations. the combination that gave the highest signal-to-noise ratio was determined to be  <dig>  ug/well of capture mab  <dig> and  <dig>  ug/well of mab  <dig> for detection. the tested virus was considered to be positive with h <dig> antigen in the dual elisa when the absorbance was three times higher than that of the non-h <dig> viruses.

serum antibodies to h <dig> can be detected by virtue of their ability to block the recognition of the target epitope by a h <dig> specific mab in an elisa assay. to combine this assay to the ac-elisa, serum samples were incubated with the fixed amount of recombinant baculovirus, which displays h <dig> on the virus surface, before being loaded to the plate coated with the capture mab. h <dig> antibody titers in samples were determined based on the reduction of the detected h <dig> baculovirus. different concentrations of h <dig> baculovirus were tested before confirming the optimal concentration at  <dig> hau. serum panels from normal or h <dig> immunized chicken and mice were used to determine the cut-off value. first, a panel of normal serum samples from  <dig> chicken and  <dig> mice lacking antibodies to h <dig> was used to determine the baseline of non-specific reduction in mab  <dig> binding to h <dig> antigen in the dual elisa. mean reduction of dual elisa readings was  <dig> % for this serum panel, with a standard deviation  of  <dig> . specific blocking activities can be determined with 95% confidence if a “cut-off value” of ≥30% is set for serum samples. the latter was obtained by adding  <dig> sd to the mean  <dig> % blocking . in the test, the dilution factor of each serum sample at was recorded when it presented ≥30% signal blocking rate. additionally, the blocking rate of each sample diluted at  <dig> times was recorded for comparison.

specificity and sensitivity of h <dig> antigen detection by the dual-function-elisa
the specificity of h <dig> antigen detection by the dual elisa was tested with 6 h <dig> strains from humans and avian species and  <dig> representative non-h <dig> subtype influenza virus strains from different regions and years, including pandemic influenza and avian influenza virus strains circulating in humans . viruses of h <dig> or ha subtypes not available in our laboratory were rescued by reverse genetics with the six internal genes from a/puerto rico/ 8/ <dig>  the reactivity and specificity of h <dig> antigen detection in the dual-elisa were examined with  <dig> ul of pbs containing the h <dig> strains adjusted to an ha titer of  <dig>  non-h <dig> viruses with ha titers of ≥ <dig> were used in order to eliminate false-positive results. no cross-reactivity was observed for any of the non-h <dig> subtype viruses tested.

the analytical sensitivity of h <dig> antigen detection in the dual elisa was determined against four different h <dig> strains which had absorbance readings ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  at  <dig> hau . the three selected h <dig> viruses were diluted serially for the determination of the detection limit based on virus ha titer. with a cut-off value of  <dig> , the detection limit was determined to be  <dig> ul of sample containing  <dig> ha titer of virus  for viruses that had average and higher-than-average absorbance, while it was  <dig> ha titers  for viruses that had lower-than-average absorbance. the detection limit of hi test for influenza virus was determined at  <dig> hau  and subtype cross-reactivity were observed.

specificity of h <dig> antibody detection by the dual-function-elisa
the specificity of the h <dig> detection by the dual elisa was investigated using a panel of antisera from experimentally immunized chickens, mice and guinea pigs. animal sera collected 10 days after the 2nd immunization were first diluted to obtain hi titer of  <dig> to the homologous virus to normalize antibody concentrations prior to use in eb-elisa. sera from chicken immunized with h7n <dig> influenza viruses  presented ≥85% inhibition in mab  <dig> binding, while sera from chickens immunized with h1-h <dig> and h8-h <dig> showed maximum blocking of 10%, well below the 30% threshold established for samples containing h <dig> specific antibodies. no inhibition was detected with sera immunized with wild type baculovirus. positive inhibition was also observed with all mouse sera from individual immunizations with  <dig> different h <dig> strains, indicating the assay is specific to detect h <dig> antibodies. all animal sera from h <dig> immunization, including chicken, mouse and guinea pigs, showed positive blocking in the dual elisa, indicating the assay is effective for sera from any species. these results indicate that the antibody detection in the dual elisa could positively identify serum samples containing antibodies to h <dig> without any cross reaction to sera from other subtypes.

sensitivity of h <dig> antibody detection by the dual-function-elisa
the sensitivity of h <dig> antibody detection in the dual elisa was primarily determined by comparison to virus neutralization and hi using purified mab  <dig>  as shown in table  <dig>  in the dual elisa, 40 ng of mab  <dig> was sufficient to reach the endpoint corresponding to a blocking rate of more than 30%, while at least 160 ng of the same mab  <dig> was needed to neutralize  <dig> tcid <dig> of h7n <dig>  virus or inhibit hemagglutination. additional comparisons of the dual elisa and virus neutralization in antibody detection were made using h <dig> immunized mice sera . the neutralization titers of mice sera after only one immunization with variant h <dig> aiv strains individually ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> against h7n <dig> . the same batch of sera was tested in the dual elisa where the endpoint titers ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  no positive activity was detected for pre-immunization serum samples by either test. the comparison indicated that the dual elisa was able to detect a lower concentration of h <dig> specific antibody and present a higher signal titer than virus neutralization.

discussion
increasing numbers of human infection and deaths caused by h7n <dig> hpai virus are currently reported in china, making h <dig> subtype influenza virus one of the most threatening flu pathogens. successful control of h <dig> hpai viruses requires early virus detection and active serological surveillance of animals and humans. despite the advantages of conventional methods such as real time pcr with high sensitivity and virus neutralization with high specificity in influenza diagnosis, the main drawback of these methods is their impracticality for field investigation. in this study, a dual-function-elisa was developed to detect h <dig> aivs by the combination of ac-elisa and blocking elisa. the method allows the specific and sensitive detection of both antigen and antibody of h <dig> aivs with the same type and amount of monoclonal antibodies. the dual-function-assay for h <dig> antigen and antibody detection provides a promising prototype for a rapid test in an ever simplified format.

a specific and sensitive immunological assay relies on good monoclonal antibodies. both mab  <dig> and  <dig> are ofthe igg <dig> isotype, which is optimal for large-scale production and purification. the relevant amino acids in the epitopes of mab  <dig> and  <dig> were identified by the sequencing of escape mutants. the identified amino acids exist in all of the human h <dig> strains, including the one from the recent outbreak in china, as confirmed with virus neutralization and hi. the site targeted by mab  <dig> is within the 120-loop, a part of the receptor binding site   <cit>  of h <dig>  while mab  <dig> recognizes an epitope located between the 180-helix and 140-loop of h <dig> ha <dig>  the 180-helix is also part of the rbs and the 140-loop contributes to the recognition of rbs  <cit> . targeting to the rbs makes mab  <dig> a neutralizing antibody with strong affinity to h <dig>  the amino acid position  <dig> for mab  <dig> is close to the h <dig> rbs but not within it. this allows the amino acid to be conserved in neutralizing epitopes.

most patients infected with h7n <dig> hpai viruses had a history of poultry contact  <cit> . however, most avian species carrying infectious h7n <dig> viruses are asymptomatic  <cit> . symptoms from h7n <dig> infection developed rapidly and treatments are effective only when administrated within 5 days after the onset of the symptoms  <cit> . therefore, detection of h <dig> antigens at the earliest stage of infection is of crucial significance to identify infections and reduce mortality in patients. this poses a serious threat to public health and highlights the need for h <dig> diagnosis. further, less cases of avian infection with h7n <dig> were reported than human cases, suggesting there may be other reasons for human infection besides poultry contacts. serological assays are able to identify the history of mild or asymptomatic infection in avian species or humans, providing critical information for surveillance studies  <cit> . hence, efficient serological detection in birds and humans is also important to control and study h <dig> hpai viruses. it was found previously that poultry species carrying aiv antibodies are shedding less virus than spf poultry upon asymptomatic aiv infection or infection with mild microscopic lesions  <cit> . therefore, ideally, diagnostic results of both antigen and antibody detection should be consulted together to create a better understanding of h <dig> infection among populations. however, applying those high-tech diagnosis tests, such as real time pcr and virus neutralization, to routine screening in public populations and birds is neither practical nor cost effective due to the limited availability of equipment and trained manpower. user-friendly rapid tests, such as dot elisa and lateral flow, are preferred in field investigation and clinical diagnosis in the neighborhood  <cit> . all these immuno-tests are initially developed from an elisa assay based on monoclonal antibodies  <cit> . in the current study, ac-elisa and competitive elisa were combined to a dual elisa with standardized mabs for both h <dig> antigen and antibody detection. high specificity and sensitivity were confirmed for either function in the dual elisa against h <dig> aivs. sensitivity of antigen detection is higher than ha tests and antibody elisa detects less h <dig> antibodies than conventional virus neutralization. the combination of two functions in one plate paves the way for an ever simplified rapid test. for antibody detection, the dual elisa is even easier to prepare than conventional competitive elisas. a small amount of baculovirus expressed h <dig> antigen is sufficient for antibody blocking in the dual elisa while highly purified and concentrated h <dig> antigen is required for coating in other celisas to minimize unspecific blocking effects  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, the dual-function elisa presented in this study was proven to provide a fast, simple and cost-effective platform for both antigen and antibody detection. the assay was highly sensitive and 100% specific in both functions rendering it effective for h <dig> diagnosis. exploiting h <dig> specific neutralizing mab  <dig> and  <dig> makes the h <dig> dual elisa a more specific and sensitive assay as compared to conventional immunological tests. a rapid test based on this h <dig> dual elisa will serve as effective tools for both h <dig> diagnosis and surveillance investigation, meeting the needs to counter the ongoing outbreak of h7n <dig> in china.

in conclusion, the dual-function elisa presented in this study was proven to provide a fast, simple and cost-effective platform for both antigen and antibody detection. exploiting h <dig> specific neutralizing mab  <dig> and  <dig> makes the h <dig> dual elisa a more specific and sensitive assay as compared to conventional immunological tests. a rapid test based on this h <dig> dual elisa will serve as effective tools for both h <dig> diagnosis and surveillance investigation, meeting the needs to counter the ongoing outbreak of h7n <dig> in china.
