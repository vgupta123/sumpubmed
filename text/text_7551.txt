BACKGROUND
cotton is the most important naturally produced fiber in the world and represents a significant global agricultural commodity. not taking into account additional economic value captured through cotton processing and associated byproducts, from 2005- <dig>  the average farm gate value of cotton equaled us $ <dig> billion . although the majority of cotton's value resides in the lint fiber used by textile manufacturers, additional benefits are obtained from cottonseed products that include animal feeds and various oil-derived products.

similar to many other economically important crops, one of the major factors affecting both the quantity and quality of cotton production is water. waddle  <cit>  estimated that a successful cotton production system generally requires a minimum of  <dig> cm of water during the growing season. hence, in planta efforts to decrease the quantity of water used and to improve cotton water use efficiency are highly desirable. at the molecular level, a potential target for manipulating water use efficiency is represented by the aquaporin proteins.

aquaporin proteins represent a large family of the major intrinsic protein  superfamily and are known to facilitate transport of diverse small molecules including water and other small nutrients through biological membranes. plant growth and development require water and nutrient uptake by transport mechanisms including a process mediated by aquaporins. although the first plant aquaporin gene was cloned in soybean root nodules  <cit> , it is now well known that plant aquaporins are ubiquitously distributed across plant tissue types. in higher plants, aquaporins consist of five subfamilies that include; 1) plasma membrane intrinsic proteins , 2) tonoplast intrinsic proteins , 3) nod26-like intrinsic proteins , 4) small basic intrinsic proteins , and 5) the recently identified x  intrinsic proteins   <cit> .

aquaporin gene identification studies in plants have primarily relied on in silico methods. by using whole genome sequences,  <dig> aquaporin genes were identified in arabidopsis  <cit> ,  <dig> from oryza sativa l.  <cit> ,  <dig> from vitis vinifera l.  <cit>  and  <dig> from a moss, physcomitrella patens  <cit> . recently,  <dig> full-length aquaporins have been analyzed from populus trichocarpa genome sequence data  <cit> . expression sequence tag  data analysis also identified the presence of at least  <dig> aquaporin genes from zea mays l.  <cit> . in addition, many aquaporin isoforms have also been isolated from various plants including triticum aestivum l.  <cit> , nicotiana tabacum l.  <cit> , and pisum sativum l.  <cit> .

although pip, tip, nip and sip subfamilies are conserved in plants, homology comparisons demonstrate that plant aquaporins have divergent sequence and function. for example, as a result of sequence divergence, the pip subfamily has been classified further into two subgroups, pip <dig> and pip <dig>  aquaporins from each pip subgroup can act individually in a different manner  <cit>  or may interact together as a heterodimer to facilitate subcellular trafficking toward the plasma membrane  <cit> . in cotton, to date four pip members have been characterized  <cit> . tips are divided phylogenetically into  <dig> different subgroups  <cit>  and δ-tip represented the first identified aquaporin gene in cotton  <cit> . the nip proteins were initially thought to only be present in the nodules of nitrogen fixing legumes such as soybean  <cit> . however, nip proteins have also been isolated from many non-leguminous plants including arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , and maize  <cit>  and are known to represent a less conserved plant-specific aquaporin subfamily. compared to pip and tip aquaporin subfamilies, the sip aquaporin subfamily is not as well characterized. in arabidopsis, sip members appear to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> . the xip is a newly discovered, phylogenetically distinct subfamily and has been found widely in moss, fungi, and dicot plants  <cit> . to date, extensive functional characterization of the xip subfamily has not been reported  <cit> .

the role of aquaporins in plant water relations has been demonstrated structurally and physiologically  <cit> . as established earlier in human erythrocytes and bovine lens cells, the functional role of plant aquaporins is quite similar to that of animal aquaporins  <cit> . as a characteristic transmembrane channel protein, aquaporins have  <dig> membrane-spanning domains with two cytoplasmic termini. an additional important structural feature is the asn-pro-ala  motif that is conserved in loops b  and e , in which two npa motifs are placed in two short, fold-back alpha helices following second and fifth transmembrane helices, respectively. along with aromatic/arginine  selective filters, this conserved npa motif is known to provide substrate selectivity for molecular transport  <cit> . the expression of each aquaporin gene member is regulated differentially. some aquaporins are constitutively expressed while many others are controlled in a tissue specific and environmentally sensitive manner  <cit> . in addition, proper subcellular localization represents another layer of mechanistic regulation of aquaporin activity that probably relies on its ability to form multimers between members of different subgroups  <cit> .

while a great deal is known about aquaporin proteins and the genes that encode them in a wide variety of plant genera and species, very little is known about the aquaporins in cotton. although the allotetraploid chromosome structure of upland cotton makes it an excellent model system to study polyploidization and genome duplication by mechanisms many crops have used to evolve from diploid ancestors  <cit> , the complicated genetic structure of upland cotton challenges efforts aimed to discover gene families such as the aquaporins. derived from two diploid species , the allopolyploid composition of the cotton genome affects gene expression primarily due to different contributions of alloalleles combined with allele-specific gene silencing  <cit> . in fact, several alloalleles of aquaporin genes have been described in cotton  <cit>  and maize  <cit> , although no allele-specific gene expression analysis has been described for aquaporins. thus, it is interesting to reveal how the evolutionally conserved, multigene aquaporin family behaves in polyploid species such as cotton. to our knowledge there have only been seven aquaporin genes reported from allotetraploid cotton in the literature  <cit> . therefore, a first step in investigating the role of aquaporins in cotton water relations is to identify the aquaporin gene family. with that in mind, our objective in this study was to identify cotton aquaporin genes and investigate both their structural properties and expression patterns.

RESULTS

by analyzing  <dig> total aquaporin genes from cotton and several different plant species, many aquaporin members from allotetraploid cotton appeared phylogenetically more close to members from populus and grape for pip and tip subfamilies. the close relationship between cotton and populus aquaporins was less apparent for nip, sip, and xip subfamilies.

cotton aquaporin gene family
pip
pip <dig> open reading frames  of full-length clones were predicted to encode polypeptides of  <dig> -  <dig> amino acids in length with  <dig> - 100% sequence identity in cotton. it has been shown that in many crops including cotton, there are duplicated copies of genes resulting from genome merger and/or genome doubling  <cit> . in the present study, we identified several aquaporin genes with very high sequence similarity sharing  <dig> -100% identity in predicted amino acid sequences. these candidates include 'pip1; <dig>  pip1; <dig>  and pip1;14', and 'pip1; <dig>  pip1; <dig>  pip1; <dig> and pip1;15' . more detailed information for these genes including expression analysis is summarized in table  <dig>  the length of the pip <dig> orf ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids with  <dig> - 100% identity. pip2; <dig>  pip2; <dig>  and pip2; <dig> are 100% identical to pip2; <dig>  pip2; <dig>  and pip2; <dig>  respectively. in addition, pip2; <dig> and pip2; <dig> shared 99% amino acid sequence identity. pip <dig> and pip <dig> groups showed  <dig> - 81% identity with each other. structurally, pip <dig> had a longer extension at the n-terminus, while pip <dig> had a longer c-terminal end . however, as shown in table  <dig>  the overall lengths of estimated orfs were quite similar between pip <dig> and pip <dig>  all of the pip members contained conserved dual npa motifs in loops b and e, respectively; whereas the aromatic/arg  selectivity filter harbored identical residues, phe , his , thr , and arg  in all of the pip members except pip2; <dig> where phe  was replaced by val . in addition, four out of five  froger's positions, recognized as differentially conserved residues between aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins and thereby providing functional specificities, were conserved in all of the full-length pip sequences. only the p <dig> site was less conserved, as one of three amino acids glu , met , and gln  appeared in this position . in addition to dual npa motifs, the ar/r selectivity filter, and five froger's positions, it was reported that val  for pip <dig> and ile  for pip <dig> residues near the second npa motif have been identified as key residues for water channel activity in radish  <cit> . the val  and ile  residues were also conserved in cotton pip <dig> and pip <dig> members, respectively.

n.a.: not available.

tip
the predicted polypeptides of tip <dig> subfamily members ranged from  <dig> -  <dig> amino acids in length and showed  <dig> - 100% identity. however, 'tip1; <dig>  tip1; <dig>  and tip1;8' and 'tip1; <dig> and tip1;14' shared  <dig> - 100% amino acid sequence identity . nine other tip members belonged to tip <dig> and tip <dig> with orf lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and  <dig> - 100% identity in each subgroup. within 'tip2; <dig>  tip2; <dig>  tip2; <dig> and tip2;5', 'tip2; <dig> and tip2;7', and 'tip4; <dig> and tip4;2' we also observed very high sequence similarity . the ar/r selectivity filter in tip <dig> was his , ile , ala , and val  with no exception; whereas the five froger's positions were also very well conserved in all predictable sites as thr , ala , ser , tyr , and trp . conservation in the ar/r selectivity filter and five froger's positions provides evidence that tip <dig> aquaporins likely perform similar biological functions. in other tips, these predicted functional sites were perfectly conserved within each subgroup and p <dig> - p <dig> were thr , ser , ala , tyr , and trp  in all tips . two conserved npa motifs were also observed in this subfamily. most of the full-length tip protein sequences were predicted to be localized to the tonoplast or plasma membrane .

nip
the current study represents the first description of nip aquaporins from allotetraploid cotton. lengths of predicted nip polypeptide sequences were  <dig> -  <dig> amino acids. twelve nip gene members were present in four subgroups with a minimum of approximately 40% identity while showing sequence identities ranging from  <dig> to 100% within each subgroup. characteristic residues were less conserved in the nip subfamily in which low sequence identity was evident across whole sequences. the npa motifs for nip members also showed divergence inconsistent with pip and tip subfamilies, with amino acid conversions from ala  to ser , thr  or val . in two nip <dig> members, ala  residues from both npa motifs were converted to ser  and val  in the first and second npa motifs, respectively. in the case of nip2; <dig>  ar/r selectivity filters were very well conserved with populus nip <dig>  four amino acid residues, which include gly , ser , gly , and arg , show characteristics of the nip2; <dig> group that have been identified as silicon transporters  <cit> . apart from cotton nip2; <dig> and homologues in other plants , atnip2; <dig> was phylogenetically not closely related to the nip2; <dig> as shown in figure  <dig>  based on est sequence data and pcr sequences from cdnas and genomic dna, two of the nip <dig> subgroup members, nip6; <dig> and nip6; <dig> showed very high sequence similarity to nip6; <dig> .

sip
the current study represents the first description of sip aquaporins from allotetraploid cotton. predicted sip polypeptides had relatively short orfs ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids . these proteins also shared low sequence identity with a minimum 45% and all of the identified cotton sips were classified phylogenetically in a single sip <dig> subgroup. sites of characteristic residues were quite divergent compared to other subfamilies, which provides evidence of different solute permeability. an ala  residue present in the first npa motif was converted to thr  in four sips . in addition, the asn  residue present in the first npa motif of sip1; <dig> was converted to asp  acid. this amino acid change  to other amino acids) is the only case of the conversion of asn  in the npa motif among all of the cotton aquaporins.

xip
overall, xip aquaporins represent a recently discovered subfamily and the current study represents the first characterization of the specific xip member from upland cotton. we identified a single, full-length cotton xip gene coding for a  <dig> amino acid polypeptide. this polypeptide contains a distinct ar/r selectivity filter, ile , thr , val , and arg  . in this gene, the first npa motif was converted to npv. by conducting a homology search using a d-genome g. ramondii grxip est co <dig> <cit>  that has 88% similarity to ghxip1; <dig> at the deduced amino acid level, two additional cotton xip est sequences  were identified. these ests were derived from an a-genome species g. arboreum with identity of 96% and 61% to ghxip1; <dig>  respectively. the identification of an additional g. arboreum aquaporin provides evidence that at least one additional xip copy may be present in the tetraploid g. hirsutum genome.

gene structure
by comparing exon-intron tandem arrays predicted from several genomic and cdna clones of cotton aquaporin genes, several structural features of interest were observed. pip1; <dig> and pip1; <dig> showed very high sequence homology  with identical exon-intron structures and lengths . this structural identity was also conserved between pip2; <dig> and pip2; <dig>  which were 98% identical. moreover, these two sets of pairs from different subgroups, although having lower sequence homology, appeared structurally very similar. the gene structure exhibited three introns at similar locations, and lengths of exons and introns were almost identical as reported earlier  <cit> . consistent with the observation of liu et. al.  <cit> , two npa motifs were found in the beginning of the second exon and in the middle of the third exon, respectively.

exons were well conserved within each aquaporin subfamily  compared to introns . meanwhile, in spite of highly similar exon-intron structure, the average identity between pip1; <dig> and pip2; <dig> was only 70% in four exons and 48% in three introns . this structural and sequence similarity was also found in the tip subfamily. genomic sequences of two closely related genes, tip1; <dig> and tip1; <dig>  showed these genes had at least one intron separating two exons. one tip <dig> genomic clone identified in this study  also had a similar exon-intron structure to tip <dig> genes; however, their nucleotide sequences shared less than 65% identity . this finding provides evidence that aquaporin genes have diverged at the nucleotide sequence level, while preserving structural characteristics such as the exon-intron splicing junction. because of the location of primers used for genomic dna amplification in our study, only one intron sequence was predicted in tip <dig> and tip <dig>  previously, ferguson et al.  <cit>  and liu et al.  <cit>  reported that ghγtip <dig>  and ghδ-tip  contained two introns in their genomic sequences. figure 2b also showed three additional genomic clones with complex gene structure. particularly, nip1; <dig> and nip 6; <dig> genes had long introns with  <dig> and  <dig> exons, respectively. nip6; <dig> and nip6; <dig> also shared very high identity between partial intron sequences .

expression analysis
previous reports have suggested that aquaporins are present in all plant tissues and are regulated temporally and spatially depending on developmental stage and environmental conditions  <cit> . because the level of mrna transcript is an important factor of gene regulation, we initially examined the expression of a set of aquaporin genes by semi-quantitative rt-pcr.

six genes from pip ,  <dig> genes from tip ,  <dig> each from nip  and sip , and xip1; <dig> were analyzed to compare the abundance of mrna transcripts in various tissues. the plant tissues represented were harvested from two developmental stages of roots and leaves, young stems, and fibers . most of the pip members were expressed in all of the tissues tested, except pip1; <dig>  which was not expressed in the mature root. pip1; <dig>  pip1; <dig> and pip2; <dig> were abundant in all tissues and constitutively expressed compared to other pip members . pip1; <dig> and pip2; <dig> showed higher expression levels in young root and mature leaf. for the tip aquaporins, the levels of mrna transcripts were variable across tissues and some were expressed tissue specifically. tip1; <dig> was detected only in stem and fiber while tip2; <dig> and tip2; <dig>  were most abundant in young root . in general, nip aquaporin genes were less abundantly expressed. among the nips, nip1; <dig> had relatively higher expression in young root and fiber, nip2; <dig> in mature leaf, and nip6; <dig> in young root and mature leaf. sip1; <dig> and sip1; <dig> aquaporin genes were constitutively and highly expressed in all tissues; whereas sip1; <dig> was abundant in young root and fiber. interestingly, although xip1; <dig> was highly expressed in mature leaf tissues, no transcript was detected in roots .

analysis of cotton put contig sequences
assembled est data provides a useful resource for the identification and analyses of nucleotide sequence information. this is especially true for many polyploid crops such as cotton and wheat  <cit> , when whole genomic sequences are not available. it is also important to use this information with care - especially when dealing with multigene families. because sequences with high similarity are often assembled together into a single contig, it can result in inadvertent assembly-induced sequence recombination  <cit> . after we initially identified aquaporin candidate genes, each of those genes were blasted against plantgdb-assembled unique transcripts  sequences in plantgdb http://www.plantgdb.org/. plantgdb is a database of plant est sequences that are assembled into contigs representing tentative unique genes  <cit> .

initially, put contigs corresponding to each aquaporin gene were identified. then, to minimize potential errors in contig assemblies, sequence alignments of each put contig were visually inspected. this was accomplished, as suggested by dong et. al.  <cit> , by examining and reconstituting all sets of est populations. two interesting phenomena were uncovered from this analysis as follows. first,  <dig> put sequence contigs were identified as mixtures of two or three sub-contigs that could be separated and matched to an individual aquaporin gene . second, in seven out of ten puts analyzed, a subset of ests was differentiated from one another according to their tissue origin. accordingly, we separated those put sequences into two or three individual aquaporin genes. for example, put <dig> consisted of  <dig> ests which were divided into two aquaporins, pip1; <dig> and pip1; <dig>  ten of the  <dig> ests for pip1; <dig> originated from fiber ests. the remaining two ests belonged to pip1; <dig> and originated from stem ests . a similar pattern was found for tip2; <dig> and tip2; <dig>  in fact, both genes were isolated independently by pcr cloning and were matched to different ests. however, by comparing put contig data, the est sequences representing tip2; <dig> and tip2; <dig> were shown to be a part of the same put contig, put <dig>  as a result of visual analysis of put <dig>  it appeared that  <dig> ests represented tip2; <dig> while tip2; <dig> was reconstituted by  <dig> other ests isolated from stem  and root . rt-pcr analysis also showed that tip2; <dig> was highly abundant in young root, stem and leaf tissues, which supported the result of tip2; <dig> abundance from the put analysis. from this analysis, it was possible to annotate cotton aquaporin genes more precisely. furthermore, comparable expression data were obtained  that supported rt-pcr data .

discussion
highly similar and divergent cotton aquaporin genes
the significance of the multigene family of aquaporin transmembrane proteins is emerging from studies aimed at optimizing water and nutrient use efficiency. this large gene family has been shown to be highly diversified in plants and thus likely harbors functionally multifaceted behaviors in plants under various growth circumstances. since the global importance of cotton as a primary natural fiber source in production agriculture is well established, our goal in this study was to identify all the members of the aquaporin family in the cotton genome. toward this end, combined efforts were required from bioinformatic homology search and the cloning of cdna and genomic dna gene fragments. bioinformatic sequence data of cotton are limited in both est databases and an available genomic sequence; the majority of cotton est databases consist of sequences known to be expressed in fiber tissues  <cit>  and thus are not sufficient in expressed sequences from other plant tissues.

our combined approach enabled us to identify a total of  <dig> aquaporin genes in cotton. the number of aquaporin genes described in this study almost doubles previously reported numbers within most single species and is greater than the largest number  recently identified populus aquaporin genes  <cit> . this increase is likely the result from highly similar aquaporin members within each aquaporin subfamily, primarily in pip  and tip subfamilies  . meanwhile, the number of nip and sip aquaporin genes identified here are similar to the number identified in other plant species; hence, it is possible that more genes belonging to these subfamilies are yet to be isolated in cotton. it is also plausible that the large number of aquaporin genes identified in this study is somewhat inflated due to gene duplication, which has been reported in tetraploid cotton  <cit> . accordingly, determining the genome assignment  of each identified candidate aquaporin gene will be important to investigate the evolutionary history of cotton aquaporin genes during allotetraploid formation. in the case of xip aquaporins, thus far only one member has been cloned in tetraploid cotton, while  <dig> have been cloned in populus. from the comparison mentioned above between cotton and populus aquaporins, it is plausible that genome merger/doubling during cotton domestication affected the expansion of pip and tip subfamilies while nip, sip, and xip subfamilies were not affected or subsequently deleted after genome duplication. from the presence of three additional xip est sequences in a or d genome cotton species, it is also possible that tetraploid cotton may have evolved to contain more copies of aquaporin genes belonging to xip subfamily. also, as shown in table  <dig>  when we analyzed our sequence data along with put assembly contig sequences, a set of aquaporin gene pairs existed with several nucleotide substitutions while conserving their amino acid sequence. in these cases, most of the amino acid sites remained unchanged in spite of nucleotide substitution. because we cloned pcr fragments from allotetraploid cotton, each cloned pair of genes with high sequence homology might represent duplicated copies present in the a and d genomes  <cit> .

from the preliminary analysis, it appeared that several pcr clones identified as individual sequences belonged to the same put assembly contig. those pcr sequences were pairs of tip1; <dig> and tip 1; <dig> , tip2; <dig> and tip2; <dig> , and nip6; <dig> and nip6; <dig> . interestingly, we compared the partial aquaporin fragment previously isolated by smart et al. from cotton fiber  <cit> , and found the fragment differed from tip2; <dig> and tip2; <dig> by a single amino acid. considering the polyploid nature of upland cotton, we decided to compare all candidate aquaporin genes with put contig sequences and subsequently inspected the assembled data visually in each put. this analysis allowed us to separate genes with high sequence similarity from a unique put transcript into individual aquaporin genes. in the case of the pip1; <dig> contig from plantgdb, put-165a-gossypium_hirsutum- <dig> consisted of  <dig> ests. two of the  <dig> ests  represented a different sequence which had  <dig> nucleotide differences. therefore, we were able to differentiate pip1; <dig> and pip1; <dig> from the original contig, put <dig> . moreover, these two ests  were derived from the same tissue . this finding prompted us to differentiate est sequences from one another in a put contig assembly sequence. because of the highly conserved sequence similarity, this type of combined assembling event has been previously reported when analyzing ests derived from allotetraploid cotton  <cit> . likewise, a put contig  assembled from  <dig> ests was separated into two individual aquaporin genes. one of the two genes was pip2; <dig>  originally cloned as a pcr fragment, and the other was pip2; <dig> which differs at  <dig> nucleotide positions from pip2; <dig> . when predicted proteins were aligned together, six of nine predicted amino acid positions remained unchanged. one of the conserved positions was a p <dig> froger's position known as a residue of functional importance   <cit> . it is also interesting that all of the est sequences for pip2; <dig> are derived from samples containing stems while pip2; <dig> ests are from a mixture of tissues.

although we detected an xip gene in cotton, to date, xip genes have not been identified in monocots or arabidopsis. hence, it is plausible that functional characteristics of xip aquaporins have not been evolutionarily conserved to the extent of other aquaporin subfamilies such as pip and tip. our data indicates that ghxip1; <dig> does not accumulate in root tissue. however, it is highly expressed in mature leaf tissue, and moderately in other aerial tissues . this expression data, along with the presence of a specialized ar/r filter in xip, implies that xip may have different substrate specificity or affect solute transport in different manners from other aquaporin subfamilies.

sequence-function relationship in cotton aquaporins
an obvious question drawn from the existence of at least  <dig> cotton aquaporin genes is why are so many aquaporins necessary? subcellular localization of all pip members is predicted to reside in the plasma membrane . therefore, an abundant number of channel proteins, pip <dig> and pip <dig> would be important for movement of water and other non-polar small molecules. these pip isoforms are known to form multimeric tetramers in vivo and in vitro. for example, pip <dig> isoforms in maize and rice are not functionally expressed alone in oocytes. this defect is alleviated by the co-expression of pip <dig> isoforms causing the correct localization toward the plasma membrane and/or formation of a heterotetramer  <cit> . thus, the multigenic nature of aquaporins in plants might facilitate their ability to regulate transport activities for water and other small molecules by redundantly modulating the abundance or multiple pairing of aquaporin water channels as demonstrated earlier  <cit> . in addition, it was demonstrated that functionally distinct vacuoles were labeled with different combinations of tip antibodies in plant cells, supporting the diversification of the tip subfamily in relation to vacuolar differentiation  <cit> . it is important to note that questions have been raised against the possible roles that tips play as different vacuole markers  <cit> . recently, using confocal microscopy, distinct subcellular localization has been detected for ten arabidopsis tips that showed cell-type or tissue-specific expression  <cit> .

highly conserved residues have been shown to be functionally important for substrate filtering and gating of aquaporin channel proteins  <cit> . considering the nip subfamily of aquaporins, it is noteworthy that the predicted si transporters in the aquaporin channel protein family belong to nip <dig> aquaporin genes  <cit> . as demonstrated in table  <dig>  four amino acids  in nip2; <dig> are very well conserved at the ar/r selectivity filter across plants including cotton  <cit> . however, arabidopsis nip2; <dig> is an exception, as it is impermeable to si and structurally less conserved compared to other nip2; <dig> members  <cit> . hence, it appears that atnip2; <dig> is phylogenetically not closely related to cotton nip2; <dig>  ptnip2; <dig>  and osnip2; <dig>  further investigations on the role of nip2;1/silicon transporters in cotton and other dicot plants are needed since the si transporter activity of nip2; <dig> has been studied predominantly in monocots.

in addition, by comparing  <dig> mips among plants and animals, it has been demonstrated that five amino acid residues were distinguishable between aquaporin and glycerol channel proteins  <cit> . the importance of these residues was partially confirmed by modifying two residues in p <dig> and p <dig> sites of an insect aquaporin  <cit> . therefore, the ar/r selectivity filter and froger's position mentioned in table  <dig> will provide a basis to understand a broad spectrum of aquaporin activities in cotton.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrated that the cotton aquaporins consist of a large and highly similar multi-gene family phylogenetically divided into  <dig> subfamilies. the members of this gene family represent potential targets to modify the water use properties of cotton and may provide a target to manipulate water/nutrient uptake and photosynthesis efficiency  <cit> . despite recent progress on the functional identification of aquaporins  <cit> , the contribution of each aquaporin protein on substrate uptake and plant physiology remains to be elucidated. this will be achieved through sophisticated approaches such as global expression studies, knock-out experiments, and promoter analyses as well as substrate specificities under various physiological conditions in relation to water balance and nutrient uptake in cotton and other plant systems.
