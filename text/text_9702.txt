BACKGROUND
there has been another global health concern since the last few months by the emergence of a novel strain of avian influenza a  virus, which has never been detected in humans  <cit> . the virus has infected more than  <dig> with  <dig> deaths as of april  <dig>   <dig>  <cit> . according to world health organization , this avian influenza a  strain is considered to be one of the most lethal influenza viruses  <cit>  because reported infections occur sporadically, and asymptomatically   <cit> . this novel low-pathogenic h7n <dig> strain does not cause disease symptoms in animals; hence it easily escapes detection from animal reservoir and has higher probability to transmit than the previous highly pathogenic h5n <dig> strain, which killed hundreds worldwide  <cit> . even though there has been no epidemiological evidence of direct transmission between humans, signs of viral adaption to humans via its mutations have been detected  <cit> . therefore, it could be just a matter of time before the new strain of virus can pose a potential human pandemic.

genetic analysis have shown that h7n <dig> virus could acquire through adaptation the ability to infect mammals  better than other avian influenza strains  <cit>  via critical mutations  <cit> . the novel h7n <dig> virus is known to be susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. recently, another antiviral drug peramivir has been approved for h7n <dig> influenza treatment in china. these drug compounds inhibit enzymatic activity of the viral neuraminidase, which has a role in the final step of sialic acid cleavage that helps release the virus from the infected cells  <cit> .

gene mutations that cause viral resistance to most of the drugs have raised significant concern because they may trigger potential pandemics. typical well-established mutation his274tyr  within the neuraminidase  has been known to confer a very high level of resistance to oseltamivir without compromising viral fitness in the highly pathogenic influenza viruses  of both the previous pandemics  <cit> . russell et al. found that there are substantial conformational differences adjacent to the binding sites between group- <dig>  and group- <dig>  neuraminidases  <cit> , causing this h274y mutation against oseltamivir to have little effect on n <dig> neuraminidase compared to the other na group  <cit> . instead, the novel h7n <dig> has acquired other gene mutations to adapt itself more "human-like"  <cit> . in fact, all h7n <dig> specimens in china show a deletion of five residues  in the viral na stalk compared to the avian-origin influenza a   <cit> , and it was once found to increase virulence in mice  <cit> . so far, a gene mutation for arg292lys  found in the first case of h7n <dig>  in china causes reduced drug susceptibility to oseltamivir and zanamivir  <cit> . interaction mechanism of the substituted residue lys <dig> in the binding sites of some viral n <dig> and n <dig> neuraminidases were investigated  <cit> . however, how this r292k  mutation affects the inhibitor-binding site of the novel avian influenza a  virus has not yet been understood. therefore, our work aims to provide an insight into the conformational changes of the novel h7n <dig> neuraminidase binding site in the presence of the mutation. with this, we hope to understand how these steric changes affect bindings of the three inhibitors oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir.

RESULTS
mutation r289k causes different conformational changes in the structure of the h7n <dig> neuraminidase when it interacts with oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir
we used  <dig> current approved neuraminidase inhibitors , which are applied in the treatment of the influenza a , to dock independently as ligand to the non-mutated structure of the h7n <dig> neuraminidase  using autodock  <dig>   <cit> . subsequently, we performed molecular dynamics  simulation using amber  <dig>  <cit>  for each complex of na/inhibitor to obtain optimal bound conformations . as observed in our docking results, all the inhibitors bind to active site residues of the h7n <dig> na . among the  <dig> na inhibitors, zanamivir interacts more favorably with the h7n <dig> na than oseltamivir and peramivir since the complex of na/zanamivir obtains lower binding free energy  than complexes of the other two compounds  .

*numbers of hydrogen bond between the inhibitor and na: before/after mutation occurs

to detect how the conformation of the h7n <dig> na changes due to the mutation r289k and in the presence of the inhibitors, we substituted the residue lys  for arg  at the position  <dig>  using deepview v <dig>   <cit> . minimization and 20-nanosecond md simulation were performed for the new mutated na/inhibitor complexes to reach the equilibrium states. our results indicate that the mutation r289k may result in reducing the drug susceptibility of the viral strain a/hangzhou/1/ <dig>  to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir. in fact, except for the case of na/oseltamivir complex, losses of hydrogen bonds between the inhibitors and the enzyme active sites due to r289k-induced conformational changes of the na structure are observed .

structural comparisons between the non-mutated and the mutated na/inhibitor complexes reveal steric variations of the active site residues and the inhibitor-bound orientations to explain various conformational adaptions of the na binding pocket in the presence of different inhibitors. in the case of oseltamivir, mutation r289k does not cause any hydrogen bond loss; however, according to our hydrogen bond analysis , occurrence of the  <dig> hydrogen bonds  decreases during the 20ns md simulation process. it suggests that oseltamivir may be losing contacts with the h7n <dig> na during the viral adaption. while the residue arg <dig> interacts with glu <dig> and glu <dig>  the substituted smaller residue lys <dig> interacts with tyr <dig> and glu <dig>  this creates extra empty space, which could be large enough for an interference of the bulky residue trp292; subsequently induces contacts among other neighboring residues trp <dig>  asn <dig>  and thr <dig>  these interactions change the conformations of the enzyme n-terminus and surrounding residues, i.e. gln <dig>  thr <dig>  and ile145; consequently result in losing contacts with oseltamivir .

similar to the case of oseltamivir, substitution of a smaller residue lys <dig> increases the empty space among residues surrounding the binding sites of the na/peramivir complex. in this mutated complex, peramivir adapts itself to the changes of the h7n <dig> na conformation by making a clockwise twist towards the empty space to interact with glu <dig> instead . however, this slight change results in one hydrogen bond loss between peramivir and the viral na.

it is observed that in the non-mutated na/peramivir complex, residue arg <dig> interacts indirectly with peramivir via two other residues glu <dig> and glu <dig> serving as intermediate bridges. in contrast, those interaction-mediated hydrogen bonds are not present in the mutated complex. when the mutation r289k occurs, the residues glu <dig> and glu <dig> change their conformations and interact only with lys <dig> without perturbing peramivir , causing a decrease in the binding affinity with the inhibitor.

our results show that interaction of the h7n <dig> na and zanamivir is the most surprising among the three na/inhibitors complexes because the mutation r289k produces a direct contact between zanamivir and the substituted lys <dig>  in the non-mutated na/zanamivir complex, besides two polar contacts with glu <dig> and glu <dig> , the residue arg <dig> interacts with a third residue tyr <dig>  the bulky residue tyr <dig> with its planar aromatic ring serves as an obstruction preventing the contact between zanamivir and arg <dig> . when the smaller residue lys substitutes arg, subsequently causing the conformational change of tyr <dig>  this obstruction seems to be alleviated. as a result, zanamivir is pulled upwards and interacts with the substituted lys <dig>  however, changes of zanamivir conformation make it further distant to the active site residue arg <dig>  and lose their native interaction. this causes one hydrogen bond loss between zanamivir and the na protein.

in general, the mutation r289k induced conformational changes of the h7n <dig> na inhibitor-binding pocket. neighboring active site residues, i.e. glu <dig>  glu <dig>  and tyr <dig> are involved in those steric alterations to compensate for the decrease of either hydrophilicity or size of the substituted lys <dig>  the mutation results in the loss of number of hydrogen bonds between the inhibitor and the h7n <dig> na in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases of mutated complexes, i.e. na/zanamivir, and na/peramivir. it is too early to claim that the interaction observed in this study occur to all na proteins of the novel avian influenza a  virus, and these results will require further analysis since they are subject to specific docking parameters and md simulation time  to achieve the optimal and stable conformations. also, the results are interpreted for the strain a/hangzhou/1/ <dig>  from which the mutation has not yet been reported.

binding-affinity relationships of oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir with viral neuraminidase proteins of previous pandemic  and the current novel h7n9
to further investigate the binding effectiveness of the  <dig> na inhibitors to the novel h7n <dig> neuraminidase compared to the previous pandemic influenza a viruses h5n <dig> and h1n <dig>  we performed molecular docking experiments using autodock  <dig>  for these inhibitors  with several available structures of h5n <dig> and h1n <dig> neuraminidases. their binding affinities  are tabulated in table  <dig> 

* root mean square deviation  of the docked complex to the native complex structures

russell et al. shows that difference in oseltamivir-binding affinity between group- <dig>  and group- <dig>  neuraminidases is not very large  <cit> . our results are in accordance with their observation in the case of oseltamivir. compared to the other two h5n <dig> and h1n <dig> neuraminidases in our results, the novel h7n <dig> na interacts with all the three inhibitors with higher binding energy. this could suggest that even without the emergence of any mutations, the h7n <dig> viral susceptibility to these drugs is lower than the other influenza viruses. hence, it might be easier for this novel h7n <dig> strain to acquire resistance to these drugs.

in addition, based on our study of binding free energy between the h7n <dig> na and the  <dig> inhibitors, it is likely that the novel influenza a  virus adopts a higher probability to acquire resistance to peramivir than the other two inhibitors. our md simulation results also indicate that at the equilibrium state the interaction between the h7n <dig> na and peramivir is less favorable than those in complexes of na/oseltamivir and of na/zanamivir since the na/peramivir complex obtains the highest binding free energy among the  <dig> complex associations both before and after  the mutation r289k occurs  as shown in table  <dig>  in future drug design, we expect stronger binding inhibitors will overcome the energy barriers caused by potential mutations of the novel h7n <dig> influenza a virus.

CONCLUSIONS
combination of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated differential inhibitor-bindings of the non-mutated and mutated novel h7n <dig> influenza viral neuraminidase. mutation r289k-induced conformational changes that cause the loss of hydrogen bond chains between the inhibitors and the viral neuraminidase suggest potential adaptions of the virus itself for future drug-resistance. while the results are novel for the a/hangzhou/1/ <dig> strain, further studies and analysis of conformational changes in population level of other strains still needs to be conducted and experimentally verified.
