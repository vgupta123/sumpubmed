BACKGROUND
as one of the neurogenic zones in the adult mammalian brain, the hippocampal dentate gyrus  generates neural progenitor-derived neurons throughout life. this process, known as adult neurogenesis, is modulated by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors ranging from neurotransmitters, growth factors, hormones, physical activity, learning, to seizures and other brain pathologies . the newborn neurons have been shown to become functionally integrated into the pre-existing neuronal circuitry  <cit> . during the first weeks of life, newborn neurons express unique physiological characteristics thereby providing the network with enhanced functional plasticity  <cit> , extensively reviewed in  <cit> . whilst recent research suggests an involvement of newborn granule cells  in hippocampal function, the precise role of these cells still remains elusive.

cyclin d <dig> belongs to a family of three highly homologous d-type cyclins  which are important regulators of cell cycle progression. once activated, d-type cyclins associate with and thereby activate the cyclin-dependent kinases cdk <dig> and cdk <dig>  <cit> . these cyclin d-cdk complexes are deemed to execute critical functions during middle to late g <dig> phase and to be essential for the transition from g <dig> to s-phase  <cit> . unlike many other cyclins that are expressed periodically during the cell cycle, d-type cyclins become synthesized in response to mitogens and their expression rapidly declines when mitogens are withdrawn  <cit> . mitogenic signalling is also required for assembly and kinase activity of cyclin d-cdk complexes  <cit> . consequently, d-type cyclins are regarded as constituting a molecular link between the extracellular environment and the cell cycle machinery.

although different d-type cyclins can be detected in a particular cell type, they exhibit distinct cell- and tissue-specific expression patterns both during development and in adulthood  <cit> . studies from knock out mice with deletions of one, two, or all g <dig> cyclins revealed remarkably normal morphogenesis at least until midgestation , indicating a considerable degree of functional redundancy and compensatory capacity  <cit> . mice lacking just a single d-type cyclin are viable, exhibiting only narrow, tissue-specific defects. severe phenotypic abnormalities are observed only in those tissues expressing just one d-type cyclin, which feature no ability to compensate, i.e. by upregulating an alternative d-cyclin  <cit> .

in the present work we analyzed postnatal and adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice lacking cd <dig> . these animals have been reported to exhibit female sterility, hypoplastic testes in males  <cit> , as well as cerebellar abnormalities  <cit>  and impaired proliferation of b-lymphocytes  <cit> . importantly, kowalczyk and coworkers  <cit>  revealed a requirement of cd <dig> for adult neurogenesis. they showed that proliferation is impaired in the neurogenic zones of adult cd2ko mice whilst developmental neurogenesis at postnatal day  <dig> appeared to be close-to normal. the aim of our study was to determine the kinetics of postnatal and adult neurogenesis as well as the precise age at which neurogenesis ceases in the absence of functional cd <dig>  we characterized cd2ko and wt mice at seven time points during the first  <dig> months of life, and determined their potential to generate new neurons in the dg.

RESULTS
in the present study we examined cell proliferation, neurogenesis and morphometric parameters of the hippocampus of cd2ko and wt litters at seven time points during the first  <dig> months of life .

morphometry
volumetric estimation of the entire brain, hippocampus and the dentate gcl in cd2ko mice revealed significant differences compared to wt litters at all ages examined. on average, the brain was smaller by ~26% , the hippocampus by ~31%  and the dentate gcl by ~49% . these differences were already present in  <dig> month-old animals . in both genotypes, brain volume remained fairly constant over time . we only detected a slight increase from p <dig> to p <dig>  and p <dig> to p <dig>  in wt mice, and from p <dig> to p <dig>  and p <dig> to p <dig>  in cd2ko mice. the volume of the hc increased continuously in wt mice, especially when comparing ages of p <dig> and younger to p <dig> . in contrast, the hc volume of cd2ko mice showed no significant age-related differences. similarly, the dentate gcl volume did not change with increasing age, independent of genotype .

although cd2ko mice tended to have lower body weights than wt litters, the only significant difference was observed in mutant mice at p <dig> with about 14% less body weight .

absolute number of dentate granule cells
the total number of dgcs in adult animals differed significantly between wt and cd2ko mice . at p <dig>  cd2ko mice had ~60% fewer dgcs than their wt litters . at p <dig>  the number of dgcs in cd2ko mice was ~65% lower as compared to wt mice . moreover, the number of dgcs in wt, but not in cd2ko mice, increased between p <dig> and p <dig> . for all animals the ce fell below  <dig> .

number of brdu-positive cells
brdu was injected in wt and cd2ko mice of different ages  <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> or p260). the brains of these animals were examined  <dig> days later . brdu-positive cell numbers were significantly reduced in the dg of cd2ko mice , an effect that could be observed at all ages analyzed in this study . the difference was lowest at early postnatal ages with about 60% less brdu-positive cells in cd2ko mice compared to wt litters . as early as in the p <dig> group the difference between cd2ko and wt mice reached > 93% , with very scarce brdu-positive cells in the dg of cd2ko animals. in both genotypes, age significantly affected brdu-positive cell numbers, with changes fitting best to a power function  = 668654x- <dig> , r <dig> =  <dig> ; cd2ko: f = 461772x- <dig> , r <dig> =  <dig> ). brdu-incorporation was highest in the p <dig> brain and subsequently declined with increasing age. the dynamic of the age-related decline in brdu-positive cell numbers was slightly different in cd2ko and wt mice. in cd2ko mice, newborn cell numbers decreased by ~75% between p <dig> and p <dig>  and further between p <dig> and p <dig> . as early as at p <dig>  brdu-positive cells were virtually absent in these animals, with their numbers remaining roughly stable until p <dig>  followed by a further decline towards p <dig> . in contrast, wt mice started with a much higher level of cell birth  and newborn cell numbers declined continuously during adulthood . between p <dig> and p <dig>  newborn cell numbers declined at a similar rate than in cd2ko , while the subsequent decrease was less pronounced . brdu-positive cell numbers continued to decline in wt by ~68% between p <dig> and p <dig> , and by ~83% between p <dig> and p <dig> .

independent of genotype and age, brdu-positive nuclei appeared preferentially in the subgranular layer  and inner gcl . however, on brdu being injected at ages ≤ p <dig>  brdu-positive cells also appeared scattered throughout the hilus and, in particular in the p <dig> group, in the molecular layer and other parts of the developing hc .

phenotype of brdu-positive cells
to determine the potential of dg progenitor cells to differentiate into neurons we stained coronal sections against brdu, gfap and neun so as to distinguish astrocytes and putative stem cells  from neurons . independent of genotype and age of the animals, brdu-labeled progenitors preferentially differentiated into neurons within  <dig> weeks , indicating that neuronal differentiation is not affected by the lack of functional cd <dig>  only a small percentage  of newborn cells expressed gfap leaving about 35% of brdu-positive cells with an unidentifiable phenotype . however, when extrapolated to absolute numbers, the lack of functional cd <dig> resulted in a significant reduction of the number of adult-born dentate granule neurons. genotype and age-related differences in absolute numbers of newborn neurons were similar to those observed in brdu-positive cell counts . for example, in the cd2ko group we found  <dig> new neurons that were born at p28/p <dig>  which was ~94% less than in corresponding wt litters.

proliferating  cells and co-labeling with dcx
to evaluate the number of cells with ongoing proliferation, we stained brain sections of wt and cd2ko mice killed at p <dig>  p <dig>  or p <dig>  against ki <dig>  a nuclear antigen that is expressed during the g <dig>  s, m and g <dig> phases of cell cycle. ki67-positive cells were located as clusters predominantly in the sgz, irrespective of age or genotype. quantification revealed that the number of proliferating cells was considerably reduced in cd2ko mice . additionally, ki67-positive cell numbers were highest in the adolescent dg and declined significantly with age in both genotypes .

to analyze the fraction of proliferating cells that are already determined to the neuronal lineage, we performed co-labeling against ki <dig> and doublecortin , which serves as marker of putative neuronal progenitors and immature neurons. the fraction and absolute numbers of ki67-positive cells that co-expressed dcx was considerably reduced in cd2ko mice . in wt animals, ~25% of proliferating ki67-positive cells were dcx-positive, irrespective of the age of the animals, whilst in cd2ko mice, ~9% of ki67-positive cells co-expressed dcx . at p <dig>  we detected only sparse proliferating cells in cd2ko mice; cells clearly immunoreactive for dcx were virtually absent . in general, cd2ko mice appeared to have less dcx-positive cells than wt litters .

number of tunel-positive nuclei
tunel-positive, apoptotic cells were only rarely detected in the dg. a significantly lower number of apoptotic cells was observed in cd2ko compared to wt mice at p <dig> . this difference was still present at p <dig>  albeit not statistically significant . a significant decline of tunel-positive nuclei was detected between p <dig> and p <dig> in wt animals , but not in cd2ko mice. independent of genotype or age, tunel-positive nuclei appeared preferentially in the sgz.

discussion
mice with targeted disruption of the cyclin d <dig> gene  have been reported to lack newborn neurons in the adult dg and olfactory bulb  <cit> , an attribute making them a useful model to study the function of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. the temporal dependency of neurogenesis on cd <dig> during postnatal life has not been clearly evaluated. hence, we systematically investigated the time course of neurogenesis in the dg of cd2ko mice by analyzing cd2ko and wt litters at seven time points during the first  <dig> months of life for their potential to generate new neurons in the dg. in brief, our results reveal that in cd2ko mice: 1) newborn cell numbers and hippocampal neurogenesis are significantly reduced, 2) neurogenesis virtually ceases at an age around p <dig>  3) morphology of the hippocampus is almost normal but it is smaller in size, 4) the gcl volume as well as dgc numbers are significantly reduced, 5) the lack of functional cd <dig> prevents the age-related increase in dgc numbers, and 6) apoptosis is substantially diminished compared to wt litters.

adult neurogenesis persists throughout life, both in the sgz of the hippocampus and in the svz/olfactory bulb, however, the potential to generate new neurons substantially declines with increasing age  <cit> . using the exogenous marker brdu and the endogenously expressed marker ki <dig> to label and detect dividing cells, together with neuronal markers , we confirmed the age-dependent change of adult neurogenesis in both, wt and cd2ko mice. analyses of wt brains with ki <dig> and brdu revealed that the number of newborn cells declines by about 74% to 85%, respectively, between the ages of  <dig> to 9– <dig> months. this was paralleled by a decrease in the number of newborn neurons by 87%. the observed rates of age-related changes in cell proliferation are consistent with previous reports studying c57bl/ <dig> mice  <cit> . differences in the percentages of ki67- and brdu-positive cell numbers in the present study may derive from the distinct characteristics of these markers  <cit>  and the labeling protocol applied. ki <dig> labels cells during all active phases of the cell cycle  and thus provides a snap shot of the proliferative situation at the time of sacrifice of the animal. the thymidine analogue brdu is integrated into the dna of cells during s-phase of cell cycle and retained in the progeny of dividing cells. it is to note, that the results obtained with the labeling scheme used in our study reflect a combination of proliferation and survival.

noteworthy, we detected a substantial change in the absolute values of cell birth and neurogenesis due to the lack of functional cd <dig> at all time points analyzed. whilst postnatal neurogenesis was still present in the dg of cd2ko mice, albeit at a lower level than in wt litters, adult-born neurons were rarely detectable. brdu incorporation and neurogenesis were virtually absent as early as at p <dig>  these data indicate that postnatal neurogenesis is controlled by cd <dig> together with at least one other d-type cyclin, and that the age at which dg neurogenesis becomes exclusively dependent on the expression of functional cd <dig> lies between p <dig> and p <dig> 

granule neurons of the dg are generated over a prolonged period starting early in embryogenesis  and continuing far into postnatal life  <cit> . during this period, germinative zones, containing the precursors of dgcs, arise in a consecutive manner with the primary dentate neuroepithelium lining the lateral ventricles arising first, giving rise to the adjacent secondary dentate matrix, which, around the time of birth, sends precursor cells towards the dentate anlage, forming the tertiary germinative matrix  <cit> . this proliferative zone constitutes the gcl of the dg from birth up to the third postnatal week. significantly, between p <dig> and p <dig>  proliferating cells become gradually confined to the sgz, which serves as source of newly born neurons in the adult dg. this time window precisely correlates to the age at which dg neurogenesis virtually ceases in cd2ko mice.

evidence suggests that developmental hippocampal neurogenesis takes place in the presence of at least one other d-type cyclin that probably compensates for cd <dig> deficiency in cd2ko mice. supportingly, glickstein et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that cyclin d <dig>  and cd <dig> are expressed in a widely overlapping fashion in the germinative matrices that generate the dg. moreover, they observed a successive change from cd <dig> towards cd <dig> expression in these germinative zones with ongoing developmental progression, suggesting a tendency of neuronal progenitors to become cd <dig> dependent during late-stage divisions. thus, cd <dig> is most probably either functionally redundant to, or compensates for cd <dig> during development of cd2ko mice.

in addition, glickstein and coworkers detected a small number of cd <dig> immunoreactive cells also in the adult sgz of wt and cd2ko mice  <cit> . moreover, these cells were proven to be proliferating by means of brdu co-labeling. in the present study, we reaffirmed the existence of cd <dig> positive cells in the sgz of adult wt and cd2ko mice . most likely, cd <dig> expression in a subset of sgz progenitors is responsible for the few residual newborn neurons found in the dg of cd2ko mice. in apparent contradiction to these results, only the cd <dig> transcript has been detected in neurospheres derived from the adult wt hippocampus  <cit> . however, the fact that neurospheres could be derived from the adult hippocampus of cd2ko mice  <cit> , which furthermore expressed cd <dig> mrna, strengthens the hypothesis that cd <dig> accounts for dg neurogenesis in cd2ko mice.

we observed no significant differences in neuronal differentiation when comparing the fraction of neun/brdu double-labeled cells between wt and cd2ko mice. on average, 60% of the brdu-labeled cells expressed neun after  <dig> days of differentiation, independent of genotype or age, which was in the range previously reported for mice and rats  <cit> . on the other hand, the fraction of actively dividing neuronal precursors  was considerably reduced in cd2ko mice. in contrast to the brdu/neun data – this result might be suggestive of differences in neuronal fate choice. however, this is unlikely since there is strong evidence that dcx-positive progenitors are already determined towards the neuronal lineage  <cit> . in the adult dentate gyrus, dcx is expressed by type 2b and type  <dig> progenitors, and by immature neurons  <cit> . ki <dig> has been detected in both, type 2b and type  <dig> cells, denoting that these cells are proliferative  <cit> . the data of the present study indicate that cd <dig> is required for the division of at least a subset of dcx-positive progenitors. whether these belong to the class of type 2b or type  <dig> transient amplifying cells remains to be determined. an alternative explanation that must be considered as reason for the apparently inconsistent data might be the very low number of dividing cells available for examination of neuronal fate choice in cd2ko mice, which could bias statistical testing.

however, in all groups of wt animals at different ages, ~25% of all ki67-positive cells expressed dcx, indicating a stable rate of neuronal differentiation in young adults. these results fit well with previously reported observations in rats  <cit>  and mice  <cit> .

the number of granule neurons within the gcl was stereologically determined in mice aged p <dig> and p <dig>  estimations performed in wt mice were within the range reported in previous studies  <cit> . similar as already shown for rats  <cit>  and mice  <cit> , we observed a significant increase in the number of dgcs between p <dig> and p <dig>  in contrast, dgc numbers were significantly reduced  and did not change with age in cd2ko mice. this indicates that though the lack of adult neurogenesis does not affect the number of neurons born earlier in life it prevents the age-related increase in dgc numbers. thus, our results confirm previous reports suggesting that adult neurogenesis substantially adds new neurons to the hippocampal network rather than replacing existing neurons  <cit> . further evaluation of the gcl revealed a significant volume reduction by ~49% in cd2ko mice at all ages examined. there were no age-dependent differences detectable within the groups of cd2ko and wt mice. hence, while neurogenesis appears to be cumulative resulting in an increased number of dgcs over the lifetime of an animal, the volume of the dgl remains almost constant, irrespective of the presence or absence of adult neurogenesis. in agreement with previous studies  <cit> , this indicates that the density of dgcs in the mouse increases with age.

as during development, apoptotic cell death seems to play an important role in the regulation of the final number of newborn neurons in the neurogenic zones of the adult brain  <cit> . in wt mice, we observed tunel-positive, apoptotic cells at low frequencies throughout the dg. these cells preferentially resided in the sgz, with few tunel-positive cells also found in the gcl. analysis of wt mice revealed that numbers of dying cells in the dg decreased with age . this was consistent with previous reports describing a continuous decline in cell death from  <dig> months onwards in mice  <cit> , or between  <dig> and  <dig> weeks in rats  <cit> . in contrast, in cd2ko mice the number of dying cells in the dg was strongly reduced  and showed no age-related decline. thus, the pattern and numbers of tunel-positive cells closely correlate to that of newborn neurons in the dg. even if these numbers are not directly comparable, they might be useful to illustrate the relationship between rates of cell birth and death: one-month  old wt mice exhibit the highest rate of cell birth and death, with both features decreasing with age . mice lacking cd <dig> have significantly less apoptotic cells than wt mice corresponding to their lower rate of cell birth. while these mice show no age-dependent decline in adult neurogenesis from p <dig> onwards, the numbers of apoptotic cells also appear to remain stable. these findings support previous reports suggesting that adult hippocampal neurogenesis is counterbalanced by the simultaneous elimination of newborn neurons through apoptosis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study emphasize the temporal dependency of hippocampal neurogenesis on cd <dig>  and the importance of cd <dig> for adult neurogenesis. they suggest that postnatal neurogenesis is controlled by cd <dig> together with at least one other d-type cyclin. hippocampal neurogenesis becomes increasingly dependent on cd <dig> during early postnatal development. without functional cd <dig> it ceases at an age between p <dig> and p <dig>  when the tertiary germinative matrix discontinues proliferative activity. these data indicate that cd <dig> becomes an essential requirement for ongoing neurogenesis with the transition from developmental to adult neurogenesis. our data provide additional evidence that there is an ongoing, lifelong increase in the density of dentate granule cells due to adult neurogenesis.

because of the lack of adult neurogenesis, cd2ko mice are a useful model to study the functional relevance of adult neurogenesis. in this context, our findings suggest that experimental interventions  that interfere with hippocampal neurogenesis should not be started before neurogenesis becomes exclusively dependent on functional cd <dig>
