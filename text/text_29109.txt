BACKGROUND
estrogen receptor alpha , the driving transcription factor of the majority of breast cancer tumors, is a nuclear receptor that binds to the chromatin in order to regulate transcription of its target genes, ultimately to promote cell proliferation. er most frequently binds to enhancer regions and rarely to promoter regions  <cit> , and er binding to the chromatin has been shown to require the pioneer factor, foxa <dig>  <cit> . in addition to the pioneering function of foxa <dig> for interaction with condensed chromatin, er also requires a host of cofactors in order to regulate gene transcription of its target genes. transcription involves chromatin loops that form between er bound to enhancer regions and promoter regions of target genes  <cit> .

there has been recent interest in understanding the possible role of the insulator protein, ccctc-binding factor  in er biology. ctcf is a highly conserved and abundant zinc-finger protein that is ubiquitously expressed in the majority of tissue types. it is a large protein including  <dig> zinc fingers which it uses to bind to the dna. ctcf was originally identified as a transcription factor that binds to the mammalian and avian myc promoter  <cit> . more recently many different roles have been attributed to ctcf: it has now been identified as a transcriptional activator  <cit> , a transcriptional repressor  <cit> , a transcription factor involved in hormone-responsive gene silencing  <cit> , an insulator protein  <cit> , a protein involved in imprinting  <cit>  and x-chromosome inactivation  <cit>  as well as a participant in long-range chromatin interactions, both within and between chromosomes  <cit> .

as the binding profiles of ctcf and er have now been published  <cit> , several studies have endeavoured to understand potential interactions between ctcf and er. initially, computational methods were employed to describe the global pattern of er and ctcf binding events  <cit> . chan and song proposed that ctcf binding partitions the genome into er-regulatory blocks that contain er binding events and estrogen-regulated genes. this initial observation was validated on the tff <dig> locus, which showed that ctcf can demarcate regions of the genome that are responsive to estrogen treatment  <cit> . two ctcf binding events flanking the tff <dig> locus were shown to act as boundary elements by preventing the spread of heterochromatin and allowing the genes within this region to be estrogen regulated.

it is currently unknown what the global role of ctcf is in estrogen and tamoxifen-mediated gene transcription in breast cancer cells. we show on a genome-wide scale that ctcf binding is static in breast cancer cells in response to estrogen or tamoxifen treatment. we show that ctcf co-localises with key transcription factors in breast cancer cell lines and that these co-bound regions are likely to be functional. we identify cell-line specific ctcf binding events in different breast cell lines; these cell-line unique ctcf binding events are associated with genes that are highly expressed in that cell line.

RESULTS
ctcf binding is static in response to estrogen or tamoxifen treatment
ctcf is a ubiquitously expressed protein that has been well documented to act as an insulator protein and prevent looping between enhancers and promoters  <cit> . previous reports have demonstrated that looping between er and promoters of estrogen-regulated genes is required for estrogen-mediated transcription of target genes  <cit> . we therefore hypothesised that ctcf binding may play a role in regulating er gene transcription by preventing transcription of estrogen target genes in the presence of tamoxifen. to test this hypothesis, mcf- <dig> cells were hormone deprived for three days and then treated with vehicle,  <dig> nm estrogen or  <dig> μm tamoxifen for  <dig> minutes and three hours. genome-wide ctcf chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing  was performed; in all treatments and time points at least seven million aligned reads were obtained . peaks were called using macs  <cit>  and at least  <dig>   <dig> ctcf binding events could be identified across the genome in all the samples . the overlap between the samples was at least 91% and no reproducible differences were observed in the different treatment conditions  at any of the time points. genomic distribution analysis showed that ctcf binding in mcf- <dig> cells occurred mostly at intergenic and intronic regions, with only  <dig> % ctcf binding events occurring within  <dig> kb of promoters .

ctcf binding has previously been shown to separate the genome into different blocks, some which contain er binding regions and er-regulated genes, and some which do not  <cit> . similar patterns were observed in this study  suggesting that ctcf may be required at these regions to demarcate the estrogen-responsive genes within the chromatin.

ctcf binding can co-localise with er and foxa <dig> binding
as the ctcf motif has previously been shown to be enriched in er binding regions  <cit> , we asked whether ctcf binding in mcf- <dig> cells overlaps with er binding. in addition, we assessed whether ctcf binding overlaps with the pioneer factor foxa <dig>  which has been shown to be required for er binding to the chromatin and proliferation of er-positive cells  <cit> . as we have shown that ctcf binding does not change with estrogen or tamoxifen treatment, ctcf binding in hormone-deprived, vehicle-treated mcf- <dig> cells was used for the analysis. considering peaks that were called in both replicates,  <dig>   <dig> ctcf binding events could be identified across the genome. er binding was also mapped in proliferating mcf- <dig> cells, in duplicate, resulting in  <dig>   <dig> er binding events . for the foxa <dig> binding data, a previously published dataset was used that identified  <dig>   <dig> foxa <dig> binding events in vehicle-treated mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> . the foxa <dig> chip-seq was conducted and analysed in exactly the same way as the ctcf and er chip-seq data.

using the definition that a binding region must occur in both replicates, overlapping by at least one base pair, almost a third  of ctcf binding events co-localised with er and/or foxa <dig> , with the majority  of these co-localised binding regions consisting of foxa <dig> and ctcf binding, but not er binding. the probability of this overlap occurring by chance is p ≈  <dig> using the gsc method  <cit> . interestingly, when considering the  <dig>   <dig> genomic loci bound by ctcf, er and foxa <dig>  the binding of er and foxa <dig> did not necessarily occur directly over the ctcf binding summit, but did occur within  <dig> kb of the ctcf binding summit . due to the non-centred nature of the er and foxa <dig> binding in the heat map and intensity plot, the er and foxa <dig> binding appear weaker in the regions bound by ctcf/er/foxa <dig>  however, the normalised sum of the intensities of ctcf, er and foxa <dig> binding, in regions co-bound by all three factors, was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig>  respectively, showing that er binding intensity at these regions is not weaker than ctcf binding.

to determine whether er and foxa <dig> are binding directly to the dna at regions co-bound by ctcf, er and/or foxa <dig>  motif analysis was performed. the data shows that regions bound by ctcf/er/foxa <dig> are enriched for estrogen response elements , ctcf and forkhead motifs, suggesting that all three proteins bind to the dna at these regions . similarly, regions bound by er/ctcf were significantly enriched for ere and ctcf motifs, and regions bound by foxa1/ctcf were enriched for ctcf and forkhead motifs, although the enrichment of these motifs was not significant using this stringent motif analysis. in regions only bound by ctcf/foxa <dig> but not er, no enrichment for ere motifs was detected and in regions bound by only ctcf/er, no forkhead motifs were enriched. interestingly, the ere motifs were enriched in a large window surrounding the summit of the peaks, especially in the er/ctcf co-bound regions. this is in line with the er binding data that is not centred over the ctcf binding summit. the only other motifs that were statistically enriched in these categories were myf, znf <dig> and pparg, although it is currently unclear what the significance of these motifs is.

to determine whether these observations were unique to mcf- <dig> cells, ctcf and er binding were mapped in another er-positive cell line, zr75- <dig>  chip-seq was performed in duplicate for both factors and at least  <dig> million mapped reads were obtained per library . considering peaks that were called in both replicates,  <dig>   <dig> er binding events and  <dig>   <dig> ctcf binding events could be identified in the zr75- <dig> cells. previously published data reporting  <dig>   <dig> foxa <dig> binding events in zr75- <dig> cells was also used  <cit> . overlapping of the datasets revealed  <dig>   <dig> regions bound by er/foxa1/ctcf or er/ctcf or foxa1/ctcf . the majority  of the  <dig>   <dig> regions co-bound in the zr75- <dig> cell line were also co-bound in the mcf- <dig> cell line, perhaps indicating a conserved function.

genomic location analysis in the mcf- <dig> cell line revealed the striking result that  <dig> % of the er/ctcf regions were located within  <dig> kb upstream of transcriptional start sites. this differs from a normal er binding profile as er binds predominantly in enhancer regions and rarely at promoter regions   <cit> . furthermore,  <dig> % of the er/foxa1/ctcf bound regions were located within one kb of promoter regions. however, the ctcf unique and foxa1/ctcf regions displayed a normal ctcf genomic distribution with about 5% of binding events occurring within  <dig> kb promoter regions. the genomic distribution analysis of the zr75- <dig> data differed in that all the different categories displayed a normal ctcf distribution, with between  <dig> and  <dig> % of the ctcf binding events occurring at promoter regions.

ctcf and er co-bound regions are enriched near estrogen-regulated genes, compared with regions lacking either one
to determine whether the regions bound by ctcf/er and/or foxa <dig> are likely to be functional and involved in regulating gene transcription, the binding data in mcf- <dig> was overlapped with a previously published gene expression dataset that identified genes that are up or down regulated after estrogen stimulation  <cit> . in order to assess the direct transcriptional effects of er, early time points were used for the analysis, namely three and six hours after estrogen treatment. any genes that significantly changed  at either time point were included in the analysis. this resulted in the identification of  <dig>   <dig> estrogen-upregulated genes, and  <dig>   <dig> estrogen-downregulated genes. as er most often binds to enhancer regions, a  <dig> kb window on either side of the transcriptional start site of the genes was assessed for ctcf, er and foxa <dig> binding events .

results showed that regions bound by er and ctcf were, on the whole, more likely to be near estrogen-regulated genes, and specifically estrogen-downregulated genes, when compared with regions bound by either one . er/foxa1/ctcf binding events were also significantly biased towards estrogen-regulated genes, compared to er/foxa <dig> binding events that do not have an overlapping ctcf binding event. these results suggest that ctcf can mark euchromatic regions, which may allow er to bind and then activate or repress expression of its target genes. surprisingly, regions bound by er and foxa <dig>  but not ctcf, were least likely to be near estrogen-regulated genes.

ctcf can bind uniquely in breast cell lines
as some ctcf binding events overlap with er and foxa <dig> binding events, we assessed whether the ctcf binding profile in an er-negative cell line, lacking er and foxa <dig> expression, would differ. in order to determine this, ctcf chip-seq was performed in the er-negative breast cell line mcf10a, originally generated from a woman with fibrocystic disease  <cit> . ctcf was mapped, in duplicate, in mcf10a cells; this resulted in the identification of  <dig>   <dig> ctcf-bound genomic loci . analysis showed that the majority of ctcf binding events were shared between all three interrogated cell lines and that these common ctcf binding events were generally the strongest bound regions . however, reproducible differences in ctcf binding among the three breast cell lines were observed .

a cell-line specific ctcf binding event was defined as a peak identified in both replicates of that cell line and in neither replicate of the other cell lines. this resulted in  <dig>   <dig> mcf-7-specific ctcf binding events,  <dig>   <dig> zr75-1-specific ctcf binding events, and  <dig>   <dig> mcf10a-specific ctcf binding events . examples of these are shown in figure 4b. in addition,  <dig>   <dig> ctcf binding events were identified in both er-positive cell lines, but not the er-negative mcf10a cell line . this overlap is higher than the number of ctcf binding events that were common to only one of the er-positive cell lines and the er-negative cell line , suggesting a link between ctcf and er binding.

on the whole, the cell-line specific ctcf binding events were weaker than the common ctcf binding events, but they were reproducible and therefore may contribute to cell-line specific gene expression. motif analysis was performed on the cell-line unique ctcf binding events to determine if there were any differences in enriched motifs in the cell-line unique ctcf binding events. in the common ctcf binding events, the ctcf motif was the only motif that was enriched. however, the cell-line specific ctcf binding events in all cell lines were enriched for the myf motif . the mcf10a-specific ctcf binding regions also showed enrichment for ap- <dig> and tal1:tcf <dig> motifs. the function of these potential binding sites is unknown, but suggests a role for myf and ap- <dig> transcription factors in ctcf function.

cell-line specific ctcf binding is more likely to overlap with cell-line specific er binding
er binding profiles differ in different breast cancer cell lines  <cit> . this may be due to different er protein levels, different phosphorylation of er or differences in cofactor levels within the cell lines. in this study we found  <dig>   <dig> er binding events were shared between mcf- <dig> and zr75- <dig> cells ,  <dig>   <dig> er binding events were specific to mcf- <dig> cells  and  <dig>   <dig> er binding events could only be identified in zr75- <dig> cells  . this shows that only  <dig> to 60% of er binding events are shared between two er-positive cells lines, and generally the overlapping er binding events are the stronger er binding events. mcf10a does not express er and was therefore not included in this analysis.

if ctcf and er are interacting co-operatively, the cell-line unique ctcf binding events would be more likely to overlap with the cell-line unique er binding events. we assessed this by overlapping the cell-line unique ctcf binding events with the cell-line unique er binding events. a larger overlap  between mcf-7-specific ctcf and mcf-7-specific er binding was observed, compared to the overlap between zr75-1-specific ctcf binding and mcf-7-specific er binding  . additionally, zr75-1-specific ctcf binding events were more likely to overlap with zr75-1-specific er binding events  compared to the other cell-line specific ctcf binding events  . these data suggest that cell-line specific ctcf and er binding may be functionally related.

cell-line unique ctcf binding events are likely to be functional
we asked whether at least some cell line specific ctcf binding events are functional. although it is difficult to test globally whether chip-seq peaks are functional, we hypothesized that if they are, their genomic location should be biased towards genes that are differentially regulated in the corresponding cell line, with respect to other cell lines. to test this hypothesis, we performed gene expression analysis of proliferating mcf- <dig>  zr75- <dig> and mcf10a cells, and compared the differentially expressed  genes in each cell line with cell-line specific ctcf binding events.

for each cell line, a list of candidate genes was constructed of genes that were de in that cell line with respect to both other cell lines , but not de between the other two cell lines. this resulted in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> genes being included in the analysis for mcf10a, mcf- <dig> and zr75- <dig>  respectively. lists of genes within  <dig> kb of cell-line unique ctcf peaks were constructed, with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes found for mcf10a, mcf- <dig> and zr75- <dig>  respectively. fisher's exact test was performed to determine whether de genes were over-represented in the lists of genes near ctcf peaks. table  <dig> shows the results of the tests.

the number of genes differentially expressed in each cell line, with respect to both other cell lines, but not in the other cell lines with respect to each other; the number of genes within  <dig> kb of a cell-line specific ctcf binding site; and the p-values from fisher's exact test of the overlaps between those sets. the universe of genes is the  <dig>   <dig> distinct genes present on the illumina gene expression arrays used in the experiment.

ctcf is a highly conserved protein that has many different roles in a cell. in this study an additional role for ctcf as a transcriptional regulator, in combination with the steroid receptor er, and the pioneer factor foxa <dig>  is described. ctcf has previously been shown to be required for hormone-responsive silencing of target genes, together with the nuclear receptors, thyroid hormone receptor and retinoic acid receptor  <cit> . in these studies, mutation of the ctcf binding motif resulted in genes no longer being repressed in response to ligand, indicating that ctcf is required for hormone-responsive silencing of target genes. at these regions it was shown that ctcf was required to recruit corepressors, such as sin3a and histone deacetylases, in order to silence expression of the target genes  <cit> . our study now shows that regions bound by er and ctcf are enriched near estrogen-regulated genes, and especially estrogen down-regulated genes. it is possible that ctcf is playing a similar role together with er, and that ctcf is required to recruit co-repressors in order to silence gene transcription in response to estrogen treatment.

interestingly, the ctcf and thyroid response elements responsible for the synergistic gene silencing between ctcf and thyroid hormone receptor are separated by  <dig> base pairs  <cit> . this is similar to what was observed in this study, as the er, foxa <dig> and ctcf binding peaks do not overlap perfectly, but rather, may be shifted to one side. thus far, ctcf has not been shown to interact directly with the thyroid hormone receptor in in vitro pull down assays  <cit> . this may be due to technical issues or perhaps an additional protein is required in the interaction between ctcf and thyroid hormone receptor. likewise, it remains to be determined whether er, foxa <dig> and ctcf interact directly or form part of the same complex. as the er, foxa <dig> and ctcf motifs are so clearly enriched in the various categories, it seems likely that these factors bind directly to the dna and co-operate to regulate target genes.

it has been shown that ctcf binding to target sites flanking the tff <dig> locus form a chromatin loop and are required for the tff <dig> locus to be estrogen responsive  <cit> . this study has identified additional estrogen-regulated genes, namely xbp <dig>  greb <dig> and nrip <dig>  that may require ctcf binding to demarcate the estrogen-responsive regions and allow the genes to be estrogen regulated. it is possible that ctcf acts as a barrier insulator at these regions to prevent the spreading of heterochromatin. at other specific regions, ctcf may negatively affect the binding potential of foxa <dig>  <cit> . in addition, a small percentage of genomic regions bound by er/foxa1/ctcf  or er/ctcf  are involved in er chromatin loops  <cit> , supporting the idea that ctcf can form loops together with er to demarcate estrogen-responsive regions in the genome.

as ctcf binding is not responsive to estrogen or tamoxifen in mcf- <dig> cells and occurs in the absence of estrogen treatment, ctcf must bind to the chromatin independently of er. as cell-line specific ctcf binding events are more likely to overlap with cell-line specific er binding events, ctcf may direct er binding at these regions thereby acting as a 'licensing factor' for er. this hypothesis is supported by zhang et al., who showed that foxa <dig> binding, and therefore presumably er binding, was dependent on ctcf binding to the tff <dig> locus  <cit> . adding another level of complexity, previous studies have demonstrated that multiple nucleosome position sites within the chromatin are required to direct nucleosome positioning  <cit> . these nucleosome position patterns are necessary for ctcf to bind to insulator regions. it may be thus hypothesised that nucleosome position sites within the genome direct where ctcf binds, which further directs where the pioneer factor foxa <dig> binds, ultimately regulating binder binding to the chromatin.

CONCLUSIONS
the evolving role for ctcf in er biology is complex, but is likely to be multifunctional and possibly influenced by the specific genomic locus. our data suggests that ctcf not only provides boundaries for accessible and 'protected' transcriptional blocks, but may also influence the actual binding of er to the chromatin, thereby modulating the estrogen-mediated gene expression changes observed in breast cancer cells.
