BACKGROUND
bacillus anthracis and b. cereus are two closely related gram-positive species belonging to the b. cereus group . despite their close genetic relatedness, in general b. anthracis has several phenotypic characteristics making it easily differentiated from b. cereus and other members of the b. cereus group. b. anthracis is non-hemolytic on sheep blood agar, susceptible to penicillin, lysed by the gamma phage, and non-motile. conversely, b. cereus is hemolytic on sheep blood agar, resistant to penicillin, resistant to lysis by the gamma phage, and motile. in addition, b. anthracis harbors two virulence plasmids, pxo <dig> and pxo <dig>  which b. cereus lacks, although a recent reports have showed that rare b. cereus isolates harbor genes and similar plasmids closely related to pxo <dig> and pxo <dig>  <cit> . however, standard microbiologic identification can be complicated when isolates of b. anthracis are cured of both plasmids, are phage-resistant, or when rare non-hemolytic, gamma phage-susceptible b. cereus isolates are encountered  <cit> .

recently, more than  <dig> b. anthracis strains were recovered from a large collection of bacillus spp. isolates that had been stored at the centers for disease control and prevention  from the 1950s through the 1980s  <cit> . all isolates were assayed using standard microbiological procedures, such as colony morphology on sheep blood agar  and the gamma phage susceptibility test  <cit> . in addition, all isolates were assayed using the b. anthracis-specific laboratory response network  real-time pcr, which has been shown to have 100% sensitivity and specificity and includes three separate targets: one region on the b. anthracis chromosome and one region on each virulence plasmid, pxo <dig> and pxo <dig>  <cit> . during that study,  <dig> isolates were recovered that were not clearly identified or ruled out as b. anthracis due to discrepant results between standard microbiologic tests and the lrn pcr.

in the current study we used multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis  and multiple-locus sequence typing  to identify and differentiate the  <dig> isolates that gave discrepant gamma phage susceptibility and pcr results. mlva uses eight loci  to discriminate b. anthracis isolates. mlva has differentiated b. anthracis into  <dig> genotypes in two major clusters  and was used successfully to link clinical, powder, and environmental isolates from the  <dig> anthrax outbreak  <cit> . in addition to its subtyping capabilities, keim et al. reported that mlva could be used to reliably identify b. anthracis because close relatives, such as b. cereus and b. thuringiensis, generally only amplify 0– <dig> mlva loci, and any resulting allele sizes do not correspond to those observed in b. anthracis  <cit> . mlst is based on the sequencing of defined segments of seven housekeeping genes and also has recently been introduced as a typing method for members of the b. cereus group  <cit> . while this method is less discriminatory in differentiating b. anthracis isolates than mlva, it has been used successfully to distinguish b. anthracis from its closest relatives within the b. cereus group. both of these molecular methods, in addition to other standard microbiological methods, were used to characterize these  <dig> diagnostically challenging isolates, determine if they cluster phylogenetically, and establish whether standard microbiological identification or pcr were associated with false positive/negative results.

RESULTS
susceptibility to lysis by gamma phage, hemolysis, susceptibility to penicillin, and real-time pcr
the isolates in this study were chosen because they could not be definitively identified using gamma phage susceptibility and the lrn real-time pcr specific for b. anthracis which targets three genes: one on the b. anthracis chromosome and one on each virulence plasmid, pxo <dig> and pxo <dig>  no isolates were positive for all three markers. seventeen of the  <dig> isolates were susceptible to gamma phage lysis but gave negative results for all three lrn real-time pcr targets . two of these isolates were beta-hemolytic on sba,  <dig> were non-hemolytic, and one isolate was weakly hemolytic on sba. the  <dig> non-hemolytic isolates had typical colony morphology of b. anthracis on an sba plate, and with the exception of having negative pcr results, appeared to be consistent with b. anthracis. the remaining six isolates were resistant to gamma phage lysis and positive for the b. anthracis chromosomal marker used in the lrn real-time pcr. in addition to the chromosomal marker, two isolates were pcr-positive for the pxo <dig> marker and one isolate was positive for the pxo <dig> marker. the six gamma phage-resistant isolates were non-hemolytic and had the typical colony morphology for b. anthracis on sba. all  <dig> isolates were susceptible to penicillin.

mlva
all  <dig> isolates were assayed by mlva . all six pcr-positive, gamma phage-resistant isolates amplified all six vntr loci located on the chromosome, indicating that these isolates were most likely gamma phage-resistant b. anthracis. in addition, one of the two plasmid markers was amplified in three of these isolates.

among the  <dig> pcr-negative, gamma phage-susceptible isolates analyzed by mlva,  <dig> isolates only amplified 0– <dig> of the eight vntr loci. thirteen isolates produced a vrra 282-bp amplicon, and one isolate produced a vrra 261-bp amplicon. however, neither of these sizes has been previously observed in b. anthracis strains  <cit> . two isolates did not amplify any of the chromosomal vntr loci and none of the  <dig> isolates amplified either plasmid vntr loci. this data suggested that these isolates were gamma phage-susceptible bacillus spp. and not b. anthracis. one pcr-negative, gamma phage-susceptible isolate,  <dig>  amplified all six chromosomal vntr loci. however, four of the loci  had previously unobserved allele sizes for b. anthracis. the other two loci were consistent with allele sizes previously seen in b. anthracis.

mlst
all  <dig> isolates were assayed by mlst . the  <dig> pcr-negative, gamma phage-susceptible isolates were analyzed by mlst for further identification and to determine if these isolates were phylogenetically related. three new sequence types  were observed: st  <dig>  st  <dig> and st  <dig>  all of which cluster in clade  <dig>  which includes the anthracis lineage as defined by priest et al.   <cit> . fifteen isolates were identified as st  <dig>  of the  <dig> isolates, one was hemolytic; the remaining isolates were non-hemolytic. one weakly hemolytic isolate  was designated st  <dig>  and an additional hemolytic isolate  was designated st  <dig>  st  <dig> and st  <dig> clustered with other b. cereus sts in clade  <dig>  which includes the anthracis lineage, but were sufficiently divergent from the b. anthracis sts, allowing clear differentiation. st  <dig>  however, grouped within the b. anthracis lineage  and is a double-locus variant of st  <dig> 

mlst performed on the six gamma phage-resistant isolates identified four isolates of st  <dig> and single isolates of st  <dig> and st  <dig>  both of which are new sts observed for b. anthracis. these three sts all cluster within the b. anthracis lineage .

discussion
discrepancies between standard microbiologic identification and the lrn pcr results were observed for  <dig> isolates that were recovered after long-term storage. mlva and mlst were performed to aid in resolving the discrepancies and identify these isolates. for the six gamma phage-resistant, pcr-positive isolates, all six chromosomal mlva loci were successfully amplified supporting the identification of these isolates as gamma phage-resistant b. anthracis. aside from being gamma phage-resistant, these isolates were typical b. anthracis. these isolates had the typical colony morphology, were non-hemolytic, susceptible to penicillin, and clustered with b. anthracis by mlst. all of the methods used in this study strongly support their identification as b. anthracis. gamma phage-resistant b. anthracis, while uncommon, have been previously documented  <cit> .

for  <dig> of the  <dig> gamma phage and penicillin susceptible, pcr-negative isolates, mlst analysis supports the identification of these isolates as b. cereus that are closely related to each other and to b. anthracis based on their sts and position in clade  <dig>   <cit> . while b. cereus and b. thuringiensis cannot be distinguished by mlst, clade  <dig> is comprised of predominantly b. anthracis and b. cereus strains. the mlva data also supported the identification of these isolates as b. cereus. previous reports have documented the existence of gamma phage-susceptible b. cereus isolates such as these, but they are rarely encountered  <cit> . since the identification of the b. anthracis gamma phage receptor has recently been characterized, it would be interesting to sequence the gamr gene of these isolates and to correlate these results with gamma phage susceptibility  <cit> .

one pcr-negative, gamma phage-susceptible isolate,  <dig>  collected in  <dig> from the belgian congo, provided the most peculiar results. this isolate was penicillin-susceptible, amplified all six mlva chromosomal loci , and clustered with b. anthracis strains by mlst. it has been previously documented that a limited number of mlva markers will amplify in b. cereus or b. thuringiensis  <cit> , and a small number of closely related non-b. anthracis isolates have been identified that amplify all six chromosomal loci  . however, this isolate was weakly hemolytic and motile . in addition, this isolate was pcr negative for both plasmids markers by the lrn real-time pcr and also did not amplify the mlva plasmid markers. although this isolate has several characteristics consistent with b. anthracis, based on the specificity of the pcr , unusual vntr allele sizes, and the lack of previous documentation of motile b. anthracis isolates, this isolate is most likely a very unusual b. cereus.

the isolates in this study are a small subset of a larger bacillus spp. collection that was recovered after long-term storage  and limited descriptive information is available for many isolates in this collection  <cit> . for the isolates that we studied, we presume that the gamma phage-resistant b. anthracis were pathogenic when first isolated but lost the pxo <dig> and pxo <dig> plasmids during storage  <cit> . we presume that isolates of human and animal origin were fully virulent when first isolated as both plasmids are needed to cause disease. marston et al. showed many of the isolates in the original collection had loss one or both virulence plasmids during storage  <cit> . in addition, environmental isolates were most likely virulent at the time of collection because these isolates followed the same pattern of plasmid loss over time as the clinical isolates in that study. for the b. cereus isolates, it is more difficult to ascertain their pathogenicity as b. cereus isolates can exhibit a wide range of virulence and cause a variety of infections  <cit> . several methods suggest that isolates closely related to b. anthracis tend to be clinical  in nature  <cit> . however, mlst data has shown clinical isolates including isolates associated with severe disease are not clonal or restricted to the b. anthracis clade <cit> . thus, pathogenicity can not be confidently deduced based on their phylogenetic relatedness.

in addition to having a negative result for the chromosomal marker, none of the gamma phage-susceptible b. cereus isolates were pcr positive for either plasmid marker. their original identification was most likely based on phenotypic characteristics, as molecular methods such as pcr were not available at the time of collection and the plasmid profiles of these isolates could not be easily determined. although b. anthracis and b. cereus are very closely related, they differ greatly in their pathogenicity which is generally attributed to the presence of plasmid encoded factors. for b. anthracis, these virulence factors are encoded on pxo <dig> and pxo2; however, recent reports have shown that other species can harbor genes and plasmids similar to pxo <dig> and pxo <dig>  <cit> . the possibility of horizontal transfer or curing of plasmids emphasizes the importance of using a chromosomal marker for the identification of b. anthracis.

CONCLUSIONS
a primary concern when encountering unusual bacillus isolates such as those included in this study is the need to positively identify or rule out b. anthracis. these isolates could not be definitively identified using gamma phage susceptibility, hemolysis on sba, and penicillin susceptibility. b. anthracis isolates that are gamma phage-resistant or cured of both plasmids and rare non-hemolytic, gamma phage-susceptible b. cereus isolates can complicate the identification of b. anthracis. rarely, b. anthracis can be resistant to gamma phage lysis . in addition, some b. cereus isolates that are phylogenetically closely related to b. anthracis are gamma phage-susceptible. interestingly,  <dig> of  <dig> gamma phage-susceptible isolates were indistinguishable by mlst , and all three sts identified  cluster closely with b. anthracis in clade  <dig>  thus, isolates that were closely related phylogenetically to b. anthracis were also phenotypically similar to b. anthracis. in this study, the combination of mlva, mlst and the lrn pcr data were used to identify gamma phage-resistant b. anthracis isolates and b. cereus isolates phylogenetically and phenotypically very similar to b. anthracis. although the pcr was found to be specific, our findings support our assertion that reliance on a single assay remains problematic due to the diverse nature of bacteria and concerns of potential bioengineering.
