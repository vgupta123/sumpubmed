BACKGROUND
in eukaryotic organisms the individual identity of cells is determined by cell specific genes while a set of genes that are expressed in all cells functions as housekeeping genes. eukaryotic dna is highly packaged into chromatin structures, with core histone and non histone chromosomal proteins that regulate many cellular processes including dna replication and repair of damaged dna. regulation of cell cycle involves processes that are crucial to the survival of a cell, wherein detection and repair of genetic damage occurs to control unwanted cell division and maintain genomic stability. disruption of checkpoint function plays an important role in carcinogenesis and embryonic lethality  <cit> . chromatin regulatory activities along with histone modifications facilitate the contact of repair proteins at the damaged sites and promote recruitment of components of signaling cascade. acetylation of lysine <dig> on histone h <dig>  has the potential to create or obscure binding platforms for chromatin modifying enzymes and transcriptional activators. furthermore h4k <dig> acetylation can directly impact on higher order chromatin structure, thus creating an open highly accessible chromatin conformation. the major enzyme that acetylates h4k <dig> is mof  which is highly conserved in mammals and drosophila.

drosophila histone acetyl transferase mof is responsible for the interplay between the regulators of transcription and chromatin modifiers thereby governing the gene expression at transcriptional level. it belongs to the family of myst histone acetyl transferases  which consists of a conserved catalytic myst domain  <cit> . the members of this family display diverse roles in various nuclear processes and some of them have also been implicated in carcinogenesis  <cit> . mof is an integral member in the drosophila melanogaster dosage compensation process that ensures that males and females, despite unequal number of x chromosomes, express the same amount of x-linked gene products  <cit> . mof has strict substrate specificity to h4k <dig> when compared to other hats  <cit> . drosophila mof was identified in a screen for ethyl methane sulfonate-induced male-specific lethal mutations and was shown to directly acetylate histone h <dig> at k <dig>  <cit> . deletion of mof in the case of both drosophila and mammals caused substantial decrease in h4k <dig> acetylation indicating that mof is the major hat for h4k <dig>  <cit> .

acetylation of h4k <dig> by mof causes reduction in the chromatin compaction in vitro and decondensation of chromatin under in vivo conditions  <cit> . hence mof regulates chromatin based activities such as transcription and dna damage repair by h4k <dig> acetylation. moreover mof is an important constituent of x-chromosome dosage compensation complex  resulting in two fold activation of x-linked genes in male flies. males carrying loss of function mof mutation do not survive since they lack the h4k16ac enrichment on the x-chromosome for transcription of the x-linked genes  <cit> . interestingly mammalian mof has high degree of sequence similarity to drosophila mof protein and h4k <dig> acetylation is also an epigenetic signature of cellular proliferation during embryogenesis and oncogenesis  <cit> . further the role of mof in ionizing radiation  response is also conserved in drosophila <cit> . recent studies in mammals suggest that the levels of h4k <dig> acetylation were reduced both in cancer cell lines and primary tumors  <cit> . increased genomic instability, with high spontaneous chromosomal aberrations and reduced γ-h2ax foci formation after ir treatment are characteristic features of cultured mmof+/− cells. in the case of mammals total loss of function  resulted in lethality  <cit> .

faithful transmission of genetic information in cellular organisms is carried out by two basic processes such as dna replication and cell division. the first  <dig> syncytial nuclear divisions in drosophila are maternally controlled and consist mainly of s and m phases with short or undetectable gap phases  <cit> . the syncytial cycles from 1– <dig> occur inside the embryos and nuclear migration to the cortex occurs during cycles  <dig> and  <dig> where further synchronous divisions take place before the onset of cellularisation at 14th nuclear cycle. during cycle  <dig> few nuclei migrate to the poles to form the pole cells that become the germ cells of the embryo  <cit> . after completion of  <dig> syncytial cycles, the embryo undergoes cellularization. cell cycle checkpoints maintain genomic integrity and stability by regulating the progression of the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis in response to dna damage to eliminate deleterious mutations from the genome. defects in cell cycle checkpoints cause a wide variety of defects such as aging, genetic diseases, oncogenesis and neurodegeneration. proper balance of cell cycle responses are critical for cell death or cell survival to occur. though dna damage and replication checkpoint induced apoptosis has been extensively studied, less is known about the cellular responses to stress during mitosis. checkpoint failures lead to progression of mitosis without damage repair leading to mitotic catastrophe. embryos exhibiting mitotic catastrophe have giant and fragmented nuclei lacking a regular pattern and 2n ploidy  <cit> .

in the present study we report the identification and phenotypic characterization of drosophila mutants which are haplo-insufficient for maternal mof. during early embryogenesis mutation in drosophila mof leads to spontaneous chromosomal aberrations and genomic instability leading to mitotic cell cycle progression without repair of damaged dna. most significantly, we found the activation of drosophila homolog of the checkpoint kinase  <dig>  in response to mof mutation causing centrosomal inactivation. we propose that drosophila mof, like its human counterpart, is required for maintaining genomic stability during embryogenesis.

RESULTS
mof heterozygote embryos are haplo-insufficient for maternal mof gene product
mof <dig> is a ems mutation having a single amino acid substitution in the acetyl co-enzyme motif  <cit> . sequence analyses revealed that mof <dig> results from a nonsense mutation at aminoacid  <dig>   <cit> . the nature of the mof alleles has been studied by quantifying the amount of maternal mof gene product. for this purpose total protein was isolated from control  mof <dig>  and mof <dig>  embryos  and western blot analysis was carried out using mof antibody. a drastic decrease in mof expression in mof heterozygote embryos compared to wild type controls indicated that mof mutation is haplo-insufficient for maternal gene product .

asynchronous cell cycle and mitotic catastrophe in the mof embryos
mof is a highly conserved myst family hat that acetylates histone at h4k <dig> and plays an important role in transcriptional activation. studies of mof null mice showed delayed development with massive abnormal chromosomal aggregation, leading to death at an early stage  <cit> . in vitro and as well as in vivo studies in drosophila has shown that mof is required for efficient repair of dna damage induced by ionizing radiation  <cit> . since mof <dig> mutants are haplo-insufficient for the maternal gene product, we were interested to study the role of mof during early mitotic divisions that are syncytial. embryos derived from heterozygous mothers  of mof1/fm <dig> , mof3/fm <dig>  as well as yw67c <dig>  were collected. early embryos  were fixed and mounted in propidium iodide  to visualise the nuclei. mof heterozygote embryos exhibited mitotic catastrophe with fragmented nuclei that appear as large mass of chromatin compared to wild type control where the nuclei appeared normal . during early embryogenesis the initial seven syncytial divisions occur at the interior of the embryo. during cycles  <dig> and  <dig> the nuclei migrate to the cortex leaving only few yolk nuclei. we observed that abnormal nuclei in the mof heterozygote embryos are eliminated by nuclear fallout mechanism where in they are digested inside the yolk tissues. nuclear fallout mechanism protects the organism by eliminating the abnormal nuclei from forming adult structures that might be deleterious. nearly 70% of the mof heterozygotes exhibited a large number of fall out nuclei   compared to control nuclei  where the number of fall out nuclei is negligible. hence a decreased number of nuclei are present in the mof embryos compared to control . the fall out nuclei in embryos were scored when they are 2-20μm below the cortex in the syncytial blastoderm stage as they are mis-interpretated in later stages where fall out co-exists with normal nuclear migration.

abnormal mitosis in mof heterozygotes
mof is a maternal effect gene and homozygotes for mof mutation do not survive  till adult stage  <cit> . to study the role of mof in early mitosis, we collected embryos derived from heterozygous mothers  of mof1/fm <dig> and yw67c <dig> . during the early syncytial nuclear divisions, mof <dig> mutant embryos exhibited several mitotic defects such as chromatid bridges resulting in lagging chromosomes , defects in sister chromatid separation ; telophase defects  indicating that mof heterozygous embryos may be entering mitosis with damaged or incompletely replicated dna. the lethality associated with mof homozygotes was fully rescued with the addition of mof transgene. although the transgenic line expressing mof transgene was viable and fertile, it did not completely restore the chromosomal defects  . the embryos from mof1/+ display similar mitotic defects as that of mof1/fm <dig> while the embryos from fm7/+ females do not show any mitotic defects indicating that fm <dig> balancer has no role in causing the mitotic defects observed in the case of mof1/fm <dig> embryos .

mitotic asynchrony during early nuclear divisions in mof heterozygous embryos
in early embryos of wild type mitosis occurs synchronously and proceeds in the form of waves starting from the poles. mitotic synchrony during pre-syncytial and syncytial divisons in mof <dig> and control embryos was studied by staining with antibody against histone h <dig> ser <dig> phosphorylation  . control embryos showed ph <dig> staining on all the chromsomes while in the case of mof1heterozygotes both ph <dig> positive  and ph <dig> negative  chromosomes were observed. thus the ph <dig> negative chromosomes in mof <dig> heterozygotes indicate the existence of abnormal nuclei. our data indicates that maternal supply of mof is required for mitotic synchrony in pre-syncytial and syncytial blastoderm embryos . these abnormal nuclei which loose association with cortex  are unlikely to divide since they do not have centrosomes attached to them. to further confirm nuclear fallout early embryos of mof <dig> heterozygotes and yw67c <dig> were immunostained with anti-centrosomin antibody. a number of free centrosomes lacking the chromosomes were present in the mof <dig> heterozygous early embryos compared to control embryos . the free centrosomes in the embryo indicated the presence of abnormal nuclei that are eliminated by the nuclear fallout mechanism . in addition to free centrosomes we also observed chromosomes lacking centrosomes or with only one centrosome. these findings strongly suggest the involvement of centrosome inactivation in the mof <dig> early embryos.

disruption of cytoskeleton in the mof heterozygous embryos
cytoplasmic organization, nuclear division and nuclear migration in the syncytial embryos are modulated by the cytoskeletal proteins. following the syncytial divisions individual cells are produced by a process called cellularization that occurs during interphase of nuclear cycle  <dig>  thus we were interested to study the changes in the organization of actin cytoskeleton and hence control yw67c <dig> and mof <dig> heterozygous embryos were immunostained with ß-actin antibody. the typical honeycomb like structure of actin cytoskeleton observed in the control was lacking in the case of mof <dig> embryos. moreover in the mof <dig> embryos chromosomes were incompletely surrounded by the actin filaments along with few small cells that lack nuclei. these empty cells indicate the presence of abnormal nuclei which have been eliminated by nuclear fall out mechanism . in addition to the actin filaments the polymerization and depolymerization of microtubule network helps in mediating the coordinated nuclear movement  during syncytial stage of embryogenesis. since polymerization and depolymerization of the microtubules is required for proper chromosome movement, we stained the yw67c <dig> and mof <dig> embryos with alpha-tubulin antibody to visualize the organization of spindle fibres. around 66% of mof <dig> embryos as opposed to only 7% of yw67c <dig> embryos exhibited attachment of spindle fibres all over the chromsomes instead of the kinetochore, indicating disruption of the spindle fibre assembly and therefore leading to improper movement of chromosomes during anaphase resulting in lagging chromosomes. number of embryos counted in the present study is  <dig> .

the integrity of cell’s cytoskeleton is crucial for the first occasion of vasa localization in the preplasmic cytoplasm as well as second occasion in the pole plasm. proper function of the cytoskeleton is important for nuclear migration leading to formation of pole cells. here yw67c <dig> and mof <dig> embryos were immunostained with antibody against vasa which selectively stains the pole cells. as anticipated we observed drastic reduction in the number of pole cells in the mof <dig> embryos compared to control  indicating that mof is required for proper nuclear migration and formation of pole cells .

elevated levels of dna damage in mof heterozygous embryos
we next wanted to study more specific role of mof in dna damage. thus mof <dig> heterozygote embryos as well as control embryos were used in an assay that determines the extent of dna damage   <cit> . genomic dna was isolated from the embryos  and incubated with t <dig> dna kinase and 32p atp. the amount of incorporation of 32patp determined the number of exposed 5’ phosphate groups in the dna, indicating the number of single and double stranded lesions. genomic dna from mof <dig> embryos showed a highly elevated level of p <dig> incorporation of  <dig> ±  <dig> cpm/ng compared to the controls which is  <dig> ±  <dig> cpm/ng suggesting that the increase in lesions in mof <dig> embryos is due to progression through mitosis with damaged dna or incompletely replicated dna. to further confirm the double strand breaks observed in the mof <dig> heterozygote we carried out western blot studies using phospho h2av antibody. as expected in mof <dig> heterozygotes we observed an increase in the levels of h2av-phosphorylation when compared to control .

abnormal nuclei are eliminated by chk <dig> activation
late syncytial embryos of drosophila exhibit two-stage response to dna damage or replication defects  <cit> . two different kinase pathways, atm/chk <dig> pathway and atr/chk <dig> pathway play a major role in response to dna damage that is evolutionarily conserved. the dna checkpoint mediated by mei- <dig> and grp, the drosophila orthologs of atr and chk <dig> kinases, respectively, delay entry into mitosis via inhibitory phosphorylation of cdk <dig>  which allows repair of dna damage or completion of dna replication  <cit> . when this checkpoint fails, a second control operating during mitosis is activated, that results in changes in spindle structure and chromsome segregation to stop propagation of defective or damaged nuclei. this second step of control is mediated by activation of chk <dig> by centrosomal inactivation  <cit> . the increased number of fall out nuclei and defects during early mitosis in the mof heterozygous embryos led us to speculate the possible involvement of a dna replication dependent or dna damage dependent cell cycle checkpoint defect. drosophila embryos that lack chk <dig> homologue  and atr homologue  show inactivation of centrosome during the late stages of syncytial division proving that both the homologues are not required for centrosome inactivation  <cit> .

to show that dna replication checkpoint is intact in the mof <dig> embryos, we studied the levels of grp  and mei- <dig>  and we found that their levels remained the same in syncytial cycles 10– <dig> . also the levels of cyclins remained the same in the wild type and mof <dig> embryos in syncytial cycles 10– <dig> indicating that our data do not support a role of drosophila mof in the control of cell cycle in the syncytial embryos through regulation of cyclins and grp. thus our data do not support a role for drosophila mof in control of cell cycle timing in syncytial embryos via regulation of cyclins or grp levels.

the defective mitotic spindles that are short, anastral and associated with poorly aligned chromosomes in the mof embryos exhibited key features reminiscent of chk <dig> mediated centrosomal inactivation. this led us to investigate the possible role of checkpoint gene chk <dig> in this event. total rna was isolated from syncytial cycles 10– <dig> of control yw67c <dig>  mof <dig> heterozygotes and rt-pcr was carried out using chk <dig> specific primers. we observed increase in the transcript level of chk <dig> by 4-folds in the mof <dig> embryos compared to yw67c <dig> control indicating chk <dig> mediated centrosome inactivation . to further confirm mof mediated chk <dig> regulation we have conducted the mof knock down experiment using dsrna in s <dig> cells. the expression of chk <dig> was found to be enhanced upon mof depletion. gfp dsrna did not cause any significant change in levels of mof and thus used as control in the rnai study .

since chk <dig> is a major target of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated , the expression pattern of atm in mof <dig> heterozygous embryos was also studied. we observed that there was pronounced increase in levels of atm in mof <dig> heterozygotes. as reported earlier  <cit>  we also observed increased expression of p <dig> in mof <dig> heterozygous embryos indicating that mof mutation causes spontaneous dna damage leading to the activation of atm-chk <dig> pathway .

centrosome inactivation in asynchronous nuclei of syncytial mof heterozygous embryos
drosophila chk <dig> is encoded by mnk  gene  <cit>  and mnkp <dig> homozygous null mutation flies produce dna damage induced apoptosis  <cit> . to further confirm atm/chk <dig> mediated centrosomal inactivation, we crossed mof1/fm <dig> virgin females with mnkp <dig> males to produce heterozygous mof1/+; mnkp6/+ flies. the mof1/+; mnkp6/+ females were further mated with wild type males and 0– <dig> h embryos were collected. these embryos were stained with pi to check for nuclear fallout. the mof <dig> embryos exhibited high severity fall out nuclei  while mof1/+; mnkp6/+ embryos had only low severity fall out nuclei  . thus chk <dig> activation contributes significantly to the mof <dig> phenotype in syncytial embryos.

discussion
mof is a member of myst family of histone acetyl transferases and is the essential component of the x-chromosome dosage compensation system in drosophila. all mof deficient mouse embryos fail to develop the expanded blastocyst stage and die at implantation in vivo. in the present study we observed loss of maternal mof in the drosophila embryos caused mitotic defects during early syncytial cycles and chromosomal aberrations as visualized by the presence of chromatid bridges and lagging chromosomes. these defects occur spontaneously in mof heterozygyotes without stress and resemble the defects induced by x-ray irradiation or chemical treatment of wild type embryos  <cit> . our data has shown that endogenous dna damage occurs during the process of development as shown by the presence of single and double stranded dna breaks. similar phenotypes like spontaneous mitotic defects and chromosomal aberrations in drosophila were also observed in recq <dig> dna helicase mutants that are involved in dna replication and maintainance of genomic integrity  <cit> . mof is an essential component of dosage compensation complex and homozygotes for the mutation do not survive beyond late larval stages. the nuclei in mof early embryos are large and fragmented resembling mitotic catastrophe. the typical mitotic wave in wild type embryos is disrupted due to the presence of abnormal nuclei in the mof heterozygotes. such abnormal nuclei are ph <dig> negative and appear in clusters  <cit> . cellularisation occurs during the interphase of 14th nuclear division. during this stage the actin filaments in mof <dig> embryos loose the typical honeycomb like structures often leading to empty cages without the chromosomes. the empty cages are indicative of the presence of abnormal nuclei that are ph <dig> negative and have been eliminated by nuclear fallout while the centrosomes are still retained in the cortex. a small percentage of embryos also show telophase defects like rounding off of the nuclei while the chromosomes are still in the anaphase stage. similar mitotic defects were also observed in the case of another mof allele . the late larval lethality of mof homozygotes were rescued to 100% with the addition of mof transgene in the mutant genetic background while the mitotic defects in the mof heterozygote embryos were partially rescued.

in general every organism tries to protect itself by preventing these abnormal nuclei from being incorporated into forming adult structures  <cit> . mutation of pcg genes which are components of chromatin remodeling that aid in the maintenance of transcriptional state during embryogenesis also resulted in the formation of abnormal nuclei  <cit> . also the severity of the fall out nuclei in the mof <dig> heterozygotes was high containing more than  <dig> fall out nuclei per embryo which was reverted back to normal in the presence of wild type mof transgene. the response to dna damage and mitotic defects maintain genomic stability by blocking chromosome segregation and removing the abnormal nuclei by nuclear fallout mechanism. staining with ph <dig> antibody and dna dye in the syncytial embryos is a good system to detect irregular or damaged dna in drosophila and also for studying maternal genes required for mitosis and genomic stability. the abnormal nuclei that stain negatively for ph <dig> are asynchronous and are seen during nuclear cycles 11– <dig>  following mitotic failure the defective nuclei drop into the interior of embryos and free centrosomes are seen in the cortex  <cit> . in the wild type embryos all the nuclei are in actively dividing phase compared to mof heterozygote where in non-dividing nuclei are also present.

in a variety of systems, cell cycle checkpoint defects lead to progression into mitosis with damaged dna or incompletely replicated dna leading to “mitotic catastrophe”, a process that is distinct from apoptosis  <cit> . in syncytial drosophila embryos damaged or incompletely replicated dna triggers centrosome inactivation during mitosis leading to defects in spindle fibre assembly and chromosome segregation  <cit> . the hallmark of dna damage response  involves the phosphorylation of histone variant h2ax that play an essential role in the recruitment and retention of downstream proteins involved in dna repair. in addition to this γ–h2ax is also involved in the transduction and amplification of ddr from megabase domains surrounding the damage site  <cit> . in our studies using mof <dig> heterozygotes we observed increase in single and double stranded dna breaks and as well as h2av phosphorylation revealing the occurrence of dna damage event.

drosophila chk <dig> plays a vital role in response to stress. dna damage leads to increased localization of chk <dig> to centrosomes and spindle fibres and also chk <dig> is the signal for mitotic catastrophe that disrupts centrosome function leading to elimination of the abnormal nuclei  <cit> . it was also reported that mutation of mnk gene  prevents centrosome inactivation and suppresses defects associated with chromosome segregation in response to damaged or incompletely replicated dna. in our study we observed increased level of chk <dig> in the mof heterozygotes in response to the damaged nuclei causing centrosome inactivation resulting in elimination of the damaged nuclei. the number of abnormal or damaged nuclei was reduced in the embryos of mof1/+; mnkp6/+ mothers indicating that mutation of mnkp <dig> prevents inactivation of centrosomes and hence loss of nuclei from the cortex. unlike the cell cycle delays that occur to repair the damaged dna or incompletely replicated dna, drosophila embryonic system utilizes the delay to identify and discard those abnormal nuclei. when the dna lesions enter into mitosis, chk <dig> is activated as a response and leads to centrosomal inactivation and delinks the chromosomes from their centrosomes which ultimately results in loss of the nuclei  <cit> . it has been proposed that chk <dig> functions at two points during early embryogenesis in response to genotoxic stress. at the onset of mitosis dna lesions leads to activation of chk <dig> that target proteins involved in centrosomal spindle activity and in maintaining γturc localisation. this causes failure in anaphase chromosome segregation. once failure of mitotic division occurs, chk <dig> causes centrosomal inactivation and disrupts the link between centrosomes and nuclei. since centrosomes anchor nuclei to the cortex, chk <dig> response to dna damage results in loss of nuclei from the cortex  <cit> . the sensing of dna lesions by ddr machinery occurs in a complex and heterogeneous chromatin environment  <cit> . earlier reports also emphasized on the alteration in the chromatin structure that helps in the sensing and as well as spreading of the dna damage response apart from double strand breaks  <cit> .

dna damage induces the activation of chromatin bound chk <dig> by a chromatin derived signal resulting in the dissociation of the activated chk <dig> from the chromatin. chk <dig> is phosphorylated at t <dig> by ataxia telangiectasia-mutated  and transmits the dna damage signals from the upstream phosphatidylinositol 3’-kinase like kinases to the effector substrates including p <dig>  braca <dig>  cdc25a and cdc25c  <cit> . in addition chk <dig> has been reported to phosphorylate p <dig>  thereby enhancing the transcriptional activity of p <dig> responsive genes  <cit> . further the functional link between p <dig> and chk <dig> during dna damage occurs through the phosphorylation and acceleration of degradation of hdmx, a negative regulator of p <dig>  <cit> .

this study revealed for the first time the role of mof during early embryogenesis in drosophila apart from dosage compensation and response to ionizing radiation.

CONCLUSIONS
recent investigations have clearly demonstrated the role of mof in response to ionizing radiation is conserved in drosophila melanogaster. in human cells knockdown of hmof results in loss of h4k16ac and destabilization of nucleosomes that correlates with regions of chromatin decondensation. while acetylated h <dig> k <dig> appears to ‘open up’ the drosophila male x chromosome to make it more accessible to transcription, which is an important part of the dosage compensation mechanism in the fly. reduced levels of mof in mammals correlate with decreased h4k16ac, cell proliferation, cell survival and increased genomic instability. drosophila haplo-insufficency of maternal mof causes several mitotic defects in the syncytial embryos and a large number of abnormal nuclei have been removed through the process of nuclear fallout. the increased number of abnormal or fall out nuclei correlated with reduced nuclear density in syncytial blastoderm embryos of mof heterozygotes. our study demonstrates that in response to spontaneous dna damage  in mof heterozygotes, chk <dig> is activated leading to centrosomal inactivation and loss of damaged nuclei from the cortex of the syncytial embryos. furthermore removal of one copy of chk <dig> in the mof mutant background considerably reduced the number of fall out nuclei in the syncytial embryos indicating the restoration of genomic stability. hence mof seems to play a crucial role in ensuring genomic stability during early embryogenesis both in mammals and drosophila.
