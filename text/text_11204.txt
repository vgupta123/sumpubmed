BACKGROUND
marek’s disease  is a highly infectious disease caused by an α-herpesvirus, marek’s disease virus  that affects chickens worldwide. md pathogenesis can be divided into three major stages: an early cytolytic phase, which occurs between  <dig> and  <dig> days post infection , is characterized by the infection of b lymphocytes, the first major targets of mdv. the infected b cells enter circulation and induce the activation of cd4+ t cells which in turn become infected. subsequently, cd4+ t cells form the primary vehicle for mdv multiplication and dissemination, along with a smaller percentage of other cells including b and cd8+ t lymphocytes. around  <dig> dpi, the infection enters a latent phase defined by the absence of expressed viral antigens and virus production. this switch to latency is believed to be governed by many viral and host factors, such as, viral interleukin - <dig>  which acts as a chemoattractant for t lymphocytes  <cit> , and upregulated chicken major histocompatibility complex  class ii molecules on infected cells promoting the initiation of host immune response  <cit> . in md-resistant chickens, latent infection persists at a low level in lymphoid tissues and cd4+ t lymphocytes. however, in md-susceptible genotypes, a second cytolytic phase occurs 2– <dig> weeks after the primary infection, wherein latently infected lymphocytes are transformed and proliferate rapidly to form tumors in various tissues.

the primary lymphoid organs of spleen, thymus and the bursa of fabricius are important focal points of md progression. cytolytic infection initiates in the spleen before spreading to other lymphoid organs, which lag behind by a day. this is accompanied by significant cytolysis of b and t lymphocytes in addition to varying levels of inflammatory response. bursal follicles and the thymic cortex undergo regressive changes in this stage of md leading to organ weight loss, while there is massive apoptosis of thymocytes. in the spleen, however, inflammation results in an increase in organ weight. the above changes are reduced within two weeks of infection, with the organs almost returning to their normal form and structure. however, in md-susceptible chickens, a second wave of cytolytic infection around 14-21dpi results in marked inflammation, severe atrophy of bursa and thymus and permanent immunosuppression.

our prior studies of host response to latent mdv in spleen and thymus  <cit> , revealed associations between histone modifications and immune-related functions. in spleen, mdv-challenged chickens showed changes in epigenetic status of genes related to cell adhesion, g-protein coupled signaling pathways and ion transport. also, the expression of various mirnas appeared to be regulated by the trimethylation of lysine  <dig> and  <dig> of histone h <dig>  further, widespread differential histone modification enrichments were detected in the thymus at genes related to cancer and host response to viruses. we also detected bivalent domains on immune-related transcriptional regulators in both md-susceptible and resistant chicken lines. thus, it was clear that mdv infection induced significant epigenetic changes in the birds, and the individual response was dependent on genetic background.

the bursa of fabricius is the primary site for lymphocyte b-cell development and antibody repertoire formation in birds. there have been several studies of the effect of md, particularly in the spleen, but relatively few concerning the bursa of fabricius  <cit> . the latter is a primary lymphoid organ evolutionarily unique to birds and critical to the development of the b cell lineage  <cit> . b lymphocytes in all the major lymphoid organs are the primary targets of the virus in the early stages of the disease  <cit> . embryonal bursectomy resulted in the abolition of early lytic infection along with reduced viremia and tumor formation, in spite of comparable md incidence  <cit> . bursal atrophy was observed in md-susceptible line l <dig> chickens with the effect reduced in the md-resistant line l <dig> individuals  <cit> , while the bursa-dependent immune system was impaired in infected chickens  <cit> . it is, therefore, evident that the bursa of fabricius plays an important role in md pathogenesis, and it is vitally important to understand its immunological effect of mdv infection.

to address the above issues, we performed a temporal analysis of chromatin signatures induced by mdv infection in inbred chicken lines having contrasting responses to the disease. the tissue of interest was the bursa of fabricius and we included both the cytolytic and latent phases of md in this study. the biological consequences of chromatin profiles are context-specific and similar patterns can lead to a variety of outcomes  <cit> . therefore, we focused on changes of chromatin enrichments as evidence of possible epigenetic regulation. our primary goal was to associate the dynamic changes of chromatin induced by mdv infection to the underlying biological pathways to reveal the functional effects of the viral infection. due to the inherent complexities of such experiments, it is difficult to separate cause from effect, but the results could provide further clues about this complex disease and define future avenues of research.

RESULTS
genome-wide histone modification profiling
we sampled two critical time-points of md progression,  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, representing early cytolytic and latent stages of md, respectively. chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing  was performed on bursal tissues obtained from md-resistant line l <dig> and md-susceptible line l <dig> chickens. two histone h <dig> trimethylation marks having opposing effects on gene regulation were profiled – h <dig> lysine  <dig> trimethylation , which is associated with the 5’ end of active genes, and h <dig> lysine  <dig> trimethylation , which marks broad regions for silencing. more than  <dig> million reads from  <dig> samples were mapped to the chicken genome and analyzed using the waveseq peak-calling algorithm  <cit> . subsequently, peaks were merged to obtain unambiguous regions of enrichment and annotated with overlapping genes.

to verify data quality, we calculated the correlation between biological replicates using read counts in a  <dig> kilobase region around the transcription start sites of annotated genes . pearson correlation coefficients between replicates were excellent, with a majority above 95% suggesting highly consistent chip-seq experiments . the median number of peaks detected was  <dig> for h3k4me <dig> and  <dig> for h3k27me <dig> . the number of enrichment regions and associated genes were comparable across time points , with a majority of peaks for both histone marks present in all conditions. these observations were consistent with our earlier studies  <cit> , which showed that these histone marks occupied largely similar genomic regions in both lines, irrespective of infection status. thus, the changes induced by mdv infection likely involved subtle variations at specific genomic loci rather than de novo establishment or abrogation of histone marks.table  <dig>

differential chromatin marks indicate functional differences in md response
we obtained a set of unambiguous enrichment regions at each dpi by merging peak calls across samples. subsequently, read counts were calculated within these regions and comparisons between samples carried out using edger  <cit>  with a false discovery rate of  <dig>  used to define differentially marked regions . we used four pair-wise comparisons in our analysis – two of these were ‘within-line’ comparisons, wherein infected and control birds from lines l <dig> and l <dig> were compared amongst themselves. the remaining two were ‘between-line’ comparisons, in which either control or infected birds from the two lines were compared . differences detected in within-line comparisons arose primarily due to mdv infection, while variations detected in the l63v72i comparison would represent disparities in disease response. on the other hand, the l63v72n comparison would reveal baseline differences between the two lines.

dmrs induced by mdv infection
the within-line comparisons yielded striking differences between the two lines. the susceptible line l <dig> displayed large numbers of differential h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> marks at  <dig> dpi, while a similar phenomenon was observed in line l <dig> at  <dig> dpi .to examine functional significance, the md-induced dmrs were annotated with overlapping genes and analyzed for functional enrichments using david  <cit> .table  <dig>

several interesting kegg pathways were significantly enriched among the genes displaying md-induced dmrs .the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway, which is associated with various processes such as cell cycle and inflammatory response  <cit>  showed significant variations in h3k4me <dig> marks at the cytolytic stage of infection in the susceptible line and also at the latent stage of infection in the resistant line. similarly, variations in h3k27me <dig> levels were observed in both lines but at different time-points of infection, on genes linked to the cell proliferation-associated mitogen-activated protein  kinase signaling  <cit>  and wnt signaling pathways  <cit> . h3k27me <dig> dmrs were also observed on genes associated with the focal adhesion pathway, which affects cancer cell migration  <cit>  and the neuroactive ligand receptor-interaction pathway, a collection of signaling molecules and receptors. interestingly, the cell cycle pathway, the dysregulation of which is a hallmark of cancer, and the spliceosome pathway which regulates alternative splicing, displayed h3k4me <dig> dmrs unique to line l <dig> at  <dig> dpi.table  <dig>

various immune-related gene ontology  terms were also enriched among genes associated with md-induced dmrs, suggesting differing outcomes of md in the two lines .for instance, at  <dig> dpi in line l <dig> enriched go categories were associated with stress and dna damage response , cell-cell signaling, biological adhesion and cell proliferation . a similar scenario was observed in line l <dig> at  <dig> dpi, in addition to terms associated with regulation of apoptosis, lymphocyte activation and cytokine production. thus, subtle differences in enriched functional terms hinted at possible variations in underlying immune response. overall, the two lines displayed similar effects of mdv infection, but at different points of disease progression suggesting a ‘phase-difference’ in epigenetic effects of mdv infection.

epigenetic differences between resistant and susceptible lines
on comparing the two lines, several differences were observed between the control birds, but a greater number of dmrs were obtained from the l63v72i comparison . at  <dig> dpi among control birds, genes associated with immune-related go terms, e.g. regulation of cytokine production, various signaling pathways, regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation, displayed perturbed h3k4me <dig> enrichments, while terms related to signaling pathways showed variations in h3k27me <dig> levels. this phenomenon was also observed at the latent stage of infection, but with a few notable differences, e.g. t cell activation was enriched among h3k27me <dig> dmrs. these results suggested baseline epigenetic differences between the two lines, which could contribute to innate differences in immune response.

symptomatic of the highly divergent responses to mdv infection in the two lines, infected birds exhibited more than twice as many dmrs as the control birds over the two time-points. functional analysis revealed a wide array of enriched functional terms and pathways. notable examples included map kinase signaling, wnt signaling, focal adhesion and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathways, which were also enriched in h3k27me <dig> dmrs from within-line comparisons. in addition, larger numbers of immune-related go terms were enriched in h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> dmrs at  <dig> dpi, such as, cell cycle, cell proliferation and apoptosis.

thus, comparisons of the md-resistant and susceptible lines revealed innate differences in histone modification profiles in addition to variations induced by mdv infection. several immune-related pathways and go functional terms were enriched among genes displaying differential chromatin marks, indicating the functional significance of such epigenetic differences.

critical pathways exhibit common h3k27me <dig> signatures
strong statistical enrichment and association with multiple comparisons or time-points can be considered to be indicative of functional relevance and several of the above enriched pathways satisfied this criterion . interestingly, the neuroactive-ligand receptor interaction pathway and immune-related pathways such as, map kinase signaling  and focal adhesion were associated with h3k27me <dig> dmrs in both lines and shared a common chromatin signature. a majority of genes exhibited increased h3k27me <dig> levels after infection in the susceptible line at  <dig> dpi and in the resistant line at  <dig> dpi, suggesting epigenetic silencing at different stages of md. however, these pathways also displayed higher h3k27me <dig> levels in infected birds from line l <dig> compared to line l <dig>  indicating higher levels of silencing in the resistant line in response to infection. to further investigate the functional significance of these variations, we examined the underlying genes associated with dmrs in the above pathways.figure  <dig> critical kegg pathways exhibit common h3k27me <dig> signatures. a) map kinase signaling; b) neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction; c) focal adhesion signaling. several genes from these pathways display a common h3k27me <dig> pattern: there are increased repressive marks at  <dig> dpi in the susceptible line and at  <dig> dpi in the resistant line, while overall levels are higher in the resistant line. genes showing the common chromatin signature are represented by filled boxes.



neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction , as mentioned above, is a collection of signaling molecules, such as, hormones and neurotransmitters, and their corresponding receptors. several classes of g protein-coupled receptors, e.g. dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine  and histamine receptors, in addition to a variety of others, such as, leptin, glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid  receptors, displayed h3k27me <dig> variations in both lines . however, there were some important differences as well. the cytotoxic t-lymphocyte and natural killer cell-specific serine protease, granzyme a , and the growth hormone receptor , both displayed increased h3k27me <dig> levels in infected l <dig> birds at  <dig> dpi. gzma was upregulated in spleen tissues of mdv-infected chickens irrespective of genetic background  <cit> , ghr was upregulated in resistant birds at  <dig> dpi  <cit> . in bursa tissues, gzma was upregulated in both lines at  <dig> dpi, but no difference was detected in ghr transcript levels. certain dmrs were unique to the resistant line, e.g. the platelet-activating factor receptor ptafr, which exhibited higher h3k27me <dig> marks in infected birds from line l <dig> 

map kinase signaling pathways regulate a wide variety of cellular processes ranging from cell proliferation to apoptosis  <cit>  and have been linked to md-induced tumorigenesis via the virus-encoded oncogene meq  <cit> . in the classical map kinase pathway, growth factors, e.g. fibroblast growth factors , activate ras-related proteins to trigger protein kinase cascades involving raf, mek and erk, leading to varying outcomes including cell proliferation and cell differentiation. moreover, extracellular signals, such as, reactive oxygen species and stress, can activate the p <dig> and jnk map kinase pathways via cytokines, e.g. tgfβ and il- <dig>  leading to proliferation and apoptosis. several fgf and ras genes, in addition to multiple calcium channel genes, displayed h3k27me <dig> dmrs in both lines, suggesting potential hot-spots of epigenetic regulation. h3k27me <dig> dmrs were also observed on various members of the p <dig> and jnk map kinase pathways, such as, p <dig> map kinases, mapk <dig> and mapk <dig>  and immune-related genes, e.g. tgfb <dig>  nfatc <dig> 

focal adhesions consist of macromolecular protein complexes that connect the actin cytoskeleton of a cell to the extra-cellular matrix  . focal adhesions are also sites of integrin-mediated signal transduction which plays critical roles in cell migration and angiogenesis  <cit> . several genes encoding extra-cellular matrix proteins, e.g. various collagens, laminins and integrins, in addition to actinin and vinculin displayed h3k27me <dig> changes in both lines. moreover, several growth factors, e.g. pdgfa, and receptor tyrosine kinases, were also associated with h3k27me <dig> dmrs and were possible sites of epigenetic regulation.

thus, important immune-related pathways, e.g. map kinase signaling and focal adhesion, exhibited h3k27me <dig> dmrs which suggested potential hot-spots of epigenetic silencing and regulation. moreover, immune-related genes belonging to the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway displayed h3k27me <dig> variations unique to each line indicating the presence of differing epigenetic responses to mdv infection.

immune-related micrornas are associated with differential chromatin marks
various classes of non-coding transcripts have been subjects of intense study in recent years, and as a result, regulatory roles for many such species, e.g. micrornas , have been uncovered. mirnas are a class of small non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. several regulatory roles for mirnas have been discovered, ranging from immune response, inflammation and tumorigenesis  <cit> . thus, in addition to annotated protein-coding genes, we were interested in investigating non-coding transcripts associated with differential histone marks. we downloaded microrna annotations from mirbase  <cit>  and searched for nearby dmrs and genes to reveal functionally important mirnas .

based on their position relative to nearby genes, mirnas can be classified into three categories: intergenic, intragenic  and intragenic-reverse . we found h3k27me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> dmrs associated with  <dig> unique mirnas, a majority of which  were intergenic. the small size of mirnas relative to dmrs leads to two issues; first, it is difficult to attribute chromatin marks to mirnas that overlap larger protein-coding genes. second, the overall fold-difference for a large dmr could be different in the vicinity of the mirna, leading to false positives. thus, to account for the above, we concentrated on intergenic mirnas for subsequent analysis.

close examination of the list of dmr-associated mirnas revealed several immune-related mirnas, e.g. gga-mir- <dig>  gga-mir-148a , gga-mir-10b and gga-mir- <dig> . the widely studied mirna, mir- <dig>  is critical for normal b cell differentiation  <cit>  and plays a major role in immune response and inflammation by regulating members of the tumor-necrosis factor superfamily  <cit> . mir- <dig> also controls antiviral cd8+ t cell responses by regulating interferons, and mir-155-deficient mice had reduced viral clearance  <cit> . all samples exhibited strong h3k4me <dig> marks around gga-mir- <dig> at both time-points, suggesting activation, but the chromatin marks were higher in the resistant line l <dig> particularly at  <dig> dpi . mir-148a induces apoptosis in colorectal cancer  <cit>  and increases cell proliferation in gastric cancer  <cit> . gga-mir-148a displayed increased h3k4me <dig> marks in infected birds from the resistant line at  <dig> dpi, while no changes were evident at the earlier time-point . the first discovered mammalian mirna, mir- <dig>  has been implicated in a wide variety of cancers as it targets tumor suppressors for repression  <cit>  . similar to gga-mir- <dig>  strong h3k4me <dig> marks were observed at the promoter of gga-mir- <dig> in all samples, with a slight reduction in line l <dig> at  <dig> dpi .figure  <dig> micrornas with immune-related functions are associated with differential chromatin marks. a)

gga-mir- <dig> display significantly increased h3k4me <dig> marks in the resistant line l <dig> at the latent stage of infection. there are no observed differences between the lines at the cytolytic stage although levels of h3k4me <dig> appear to be higher. d)

mir-10b is highly upregulated in breast cancer and triggers metastasis of tumor cells  <cit> . at  <dig> dpi, line l <dig> displayed high levels of h3k27me <dig> aroundgga-mir-10b both before and after infection, compared to l <dig> birds . meanwhile, at  <dig> dpi, only infected birds from the resistant line l <dig> showed high h3k27me <dig> levels at this locus. mir- <dig> acts as a tumor suppressor in neuroblastoma by downregulating a histone demethylase  <cit>  and also regulates cell migration and proliferation in breast cancer  <cit> . mdv-infected line l <dig> birds displayed increased levels of h3k27me <dig> compared to control birds, on gga-mir- <dig> at  <dig> dpi, while line l <dig> displayed higher levels irrespective of infection status . at the latter time-point, h3k27me <dig> marks were reduced in control birds from both lines, but line l <dig> displayed increased h3k27me <dig> levels in infected birds.

thus, several mirnas with immune-related functions showed changes in histone modifications and were likely subject to epigenetic regulation as a result of mdv infection. the varying responses in the two chicken lines particularly around gga-mir- <dig>  gga-mir-10b and gga-mir- <dig>  also suggested the possible contribution of these mirnas to differential md-resistance.

differential chromatin and differential gene expression
having investigated global chromatin profiles, we were interested in examining the correlation between chromatin marks and gene expression levels. our prior studies  <cit>  had revealed mixed results – absolute expression levels correlated well with h3k4me <dig>  and h3k27me <dig>  levels, but no relationship was apparent between differential expression and differential histone marks. similarly, in the current study, we found moderate correlation between chromatin marks and absolute gene expression , but low overlap between differential chromatin and differential transcript levels. however, in spite of modest global correlations, transcriptional changes consistent with epigenetic variations for certain loci could indicate epigenetic regulation. thus, to find genes whose expression levels correlated with chromatin marks, we carried out a systematic comparison of dmr-associated genes and differentially expressed genes from rna-seq experiments carried out in the same tissue. subsequently, we focused on functionally important dmrs to discover possible candidates for further analysis.

relatively few differentially expressed genes were associated with dmrs enriched in the pathways outlined above, with h3k27me <dig> dmrs at  <dig> dpi being a notable exception. thrombospondin  <dig> , a member of the focal adhesion pathway, is an adhesive glycoprotein that plays a major role in proliferation and development of erythroid cell lineages, while also mediating cell-cell signaling and cell-matrix interactions  <cit> . recently, this gene was found to be downregulated in various gastric tumors  <cit>  and shown to have tumor suppressor properties  <cit> . thbs <dig> displayed significantly increased h3k27me <dig> levels  and was also highly downregulated  in md-infected susceptible chickens at  <dig> dpi. tenascin-r , belongs to a family of extra-cellular matrix proteins, which are involved in regulating cell adhesion  <cit> . other members of the tenascin family, tnc and tnw, are associated with disease, with increased expression correlating with higher cell motility and loss of focal adhesions, while tnr performs multiple functions in the central nervous system  <cit> . higher h3k27me <dig> levels around tnr , accompanied reduced transcript levels, in md-infected line l <dig> birds at  <dig> dpi. endothelial differentiation sphingolipid-g receptor  <dig> , is a g protein-coupled receptor that contributes to the regulation of cell migration  <cit>  and vascular endothelial cell function  <cit> . edg <dig> is necessary for the stimulation of the serine threonine kinase, akt <dig>  by the vascular endothelial growth factor , and reduced levels of akt kinase leads to increased apoptosis of cancer cells  <cit> . edg <dig> displayed increased h3k27me <dig> levels in line l <dig> birds in response to mdv infection at  <dig> dpi , which was coupled with significantly lower transcript levels .figure  <dig> differential h3k27me <dig> marks associated with differential gene expression. a)

itga1displayed reduced h3k27me <dig> enrichments and significant upregulation in the resistant line at  <dig> dpi as a result of md infection. the susceptible line displayed increased h3k27me <dig> marks in line l <dig> at  <dig> dpi, but there was no accompanying change in gene expression.



one of the few genes that was differentially expressed and associated with a strong h3k27me <dig> dmr in line l <dig> was integrin alpha  <dig> . itga <dig> encodes the alpha  <dig> subunit of integrin receptors for collagen and laminin on the cell surface, which regulate cell-cell adhesion and may be involved in inflammation. itga <dig> displayed reduced h3k27me <dig> levels  and increased expression after infection in resistant birds at  <dig> dpi . interestingly, line l <dig> birds exhibited higher h3k27me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> marks in response to infection at  <dig> dpi, but no change in gene expression was observed.

thus, there was limited overlap between differential chromatin marks and differentially expressed genes, with the majority attributable to h3k27me <dig> dmrs observed at  <dig> dpi in the susceptible line. integrated analysis of chip-seq and rna-seq experiments revealed interesting candidates for further analysis, e.g. thbs <dig> and itga <dig>  however, the low concordance between the two independent experiments highlights the complexity of the chromatin landscape and the multitude of regulatory factors involved in determining transcription and phenotype.

discussion
the chromatin code is a universal, multi-layered guide to the transcriptional regulatory machinery that allows tremendous diversity to be encoded into the genome, while providing an essential link between the genetic material and environmental cues. interpreting the biological consequences of variations in chromatin marks is exceedingly complex and can be likened to an attempt to discern the outcome of a voluminous treatise from its preface. the task of understanding the broader genomic effects of a complex disease, such as md, from epigenetic profiling is a similarly daunting undertaking. our prior studies of the epigenetic effects of latent md on resistant and susceptible chicken lines  <cit>  have provided us with some perspective. here, we expanded the scope of such studies by investigating two critical stages of md progression.

there were striking global differences in chromatin modifications between the two lines, as we observed a large number of md-induced dmrs in line l <dig> at  <dig> dpi and in line l <dig> at  <dig> dpi. important immune-related pathways, e.g. map kinase signaling and focal adhesion, were associated with h3k27me <dig> dmrs in both lines, indicating functional similarities in epigenetic response at different stages of mdv infection. however, the same pathways displayed higher h3k27me <dig> levels in infected line l <dig> birds compared to line l <dig> suggesting a greater degree of silencing in the resistant line. the map kinase signaling pathway has been widely associated with proliferation  <cit>  and is targeted by the meq protein to induce viral transformation  <cit> . our results suggest that this pathway might be preferentially silenced in the resistant line by h3k27me <dig>  which leads to increased transformation and tumorigenesis in susceptible birds.several g protein-coupled receptors, members of the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway, were also associated with h3k27me <dig> dmrs in both lines. however, certain differences were also apparent, notably gzma and ghr, which showed increased h3k27me <dig> in l <dig> birds at  <dig> dpi in response to mdv infection. the functional significance of these chromatin changes is unclear as there was no apparent effect on gene expression. in the resistant line, h3k4me <dig> dmrs were associated with the cell cycle and spliceosome pathways, but observed fold-changes were small and therefore, they were not chosen for further analysis.

in addition to protein-coding genes and pathways, several cancer-related mirnas were associated with both h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> dmrs. lower h3k4me <dig> levels and possible reduction in transcript levels around gga-mir- <dig> in line l72could contribute to higher md-susceptibility. two mirnas associated with seemingly opposite effects in breast cancer, gga-mir-10b and gga-mir- <dig>  both exhibited putative epigenetic silencing in the resistant line. mir-10b initiates tumor invasion and metastasis in breast cancer  <cit> , while mir- <dig> reduces the proliferative and migratory capacities of breast cancer cells  <cit> . apart from gga-mir- <dig>  <cit>  none of the above mirnas have been previously reported in the context of md and their roles in determination of md-resistance bear further analysis. also, we focused our attentions on intergenic mirnas in this study to avoid the ambiguities involved in overlapping genes and mirnas. however, it is equally important to investigate the roles of other classes of mirnas in the context of md-resistance and susceptibility and will be the subject of future work.

the global comparison of histone modifications and gene expression revealed moderate correlations, while the overlap between differentially expressed genes and differential chromatin enrichments was low. as mentioned above, this could be a consequence of the complexity of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and relatively few factors assayed. however, our data can be used to infer the location of hotspots of epigenetic regulation. using this approach we identified several genes, a majority of which were associated with h3k27me <dig> dmrs and whose expression correlated well with observed chromatin marks. three members of the focal adhesion pathway, thbs <dig>  tnr and itga <dig>  displayed increased h3k27me <dig> levels in infected line l <dig> birds at  <dig> dpi. in the case of thbs <dig> and tnr, this was accompanied by a significant downregulation, while itga <dig> displayed a concordant increase in h3k4me <dig> marks but no change in gene expression. on the other hand, in line l <dig>  infected birds showed a reduction of h3k27me <dig> levels around itga1at  <dig> dpi and a corresponding upregulation, while there were no significant changes in chromatin marks or gene expression on thbs <dig> or tnr. thbs <dig> is a putative tumor suppressor  <cit>  and its downregulation could be associated with increased md-susceptibility in line l <dig> birds. moreover, the dysregulation of ecm genes and receptors is a hallmark of cancer metastasis. our data suggests that this pathway is a hotspot of epigenetic regulation as a consequence of mdv infection and merits further investigation in the context of md-resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the chromatin landscape induced by mdv in two inbred chicken lines with contrasting responses to the disease. we found major global variations in chromatin marks occurring at different stages of infection in the two lines. functional analysis of genes associated with differential h3k27me <dig> enrichments revealed enriched pathways, such as, map kinase signaling, focal adhesion and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction that were shared between lines. however, infected birds from lines l <dig> and l <dig> displayed different h3k27me <dig> levels on members of these pathways, indicating varying degrees of silencing in response to infection. in addition, several immune-related mirnas, e.g. gga-mir- <dig> and gga-mir-10b, were associated with differential chromatin marks and could contribute to increased md-susceptibility in line l <dig> chickens. finally, several members of the focal adhesion pathway, thbs <dig>  tnr and itga <dig>  were associated with differential chromatin and transcript levels, indicating that this pathway may by a hotspot of epigenetic regulation in response to mdv infection. taken together, our results shed further light on the epigenetic effects of md, revealing striking global differences and possible functional impact of epigenetic variations. additional functional assays are necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms behind the large-scale chromatin changes and the effect on md-resistance and susceptibility.
