BACKGROUND
a set of core transcription factors  have been reported to regulate the self-renewal and pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem  cells. oct <dig> has long been regarded as one of the master regulators in es cells. oct4-deficient embryos fail to produce pluripotent inner cell mass  <cit> . furthermore, while repression of oct <dig> allows trophectoderm development, a less-than-twofold increase in oct <dig> expression drives differentiation into primitive endoderm and mesoderm  <cit> . together with oct <dig>  sox <dig> explains the first three lineages present in preimplantation development; both factors are essential to epiblast formation, and in their absence trophec-toderm is formed  <cit> . nanog, another master factor, can bypass leukemia inhibitory factor /stat <dig> to maintain es cell self-renewal  <cit> , and nanog-deficient es cells lose pluripotency and differentiate into extraembryonic endoderm lineage  <cit> .

in addition to the three master tfs, implications of the regulatory roles of a few other tfs in mouse es cells have been obtained via experimental efforts. lif signal pathway can sustain self-renewal of the cells by activating stat <dig>  <cit> ; bmps collaborate with lif for the maintenance of self-renewal via triggering the phosphorylation of smad <dig> to induce id genes  <cit> . myc and klf <dig> are two of the four factors that can reprogram somatic cells to pluripotent cells  <cit> . esrrb is required for efficient self-renewal of es cells in vitro; it is required to block differentiation into mesoderm, ectoderm and neural crest cells  <cit> . depletion of zfx impairs self-renewal of es cells while over-expression of the factor can facilitate the self-renewal  <cit> .

to reconstruct the regulatory network in mouse es cells, genome-wide binding data of these important tfs have been generated by chip-seq/chip experiments  <cit> . in particular, chen et al.  <cit>  made available chip-seq data of the following  <dig> tfs in mouse es cells: oct <dig>  sox <dig>  nanog, stat <dig>  smad <dig>  myc, klf <dig>  zfx, esrrb, mycn, tcfcp2l <dig>  and e2f <dig>  we refer to them as main factors. the authors showed that the binding of these factors is correlated with retinoic-acid-induced gene expression profiles  <cit> . furthermore, ouyang et al.  <cit>  built statistical models upon the chip-seq data, which can explain substantial variation in gene expression in mouse es cells  <cit> . however, the following problem remains to be investigated: whether other tfs that bind together  with main factors, referred to as cofactors, can further explain expression patterns? in this study, with the chip-seq data in  <cit>  and the expression data in  <cit> , we attempt to answer this question by exploring association between the gene expression and binding sites of potential cofactors on genomic islands co-occupied by groups of main factors. we intend to evaluate whether the association is different between different expression patterns, and according to the evaluation, we recommend a small set of cofactors for future follow-up experimental validation. to this end, we perform the following analyses  and report their results in this article.

 <dig>  clustering analysis of the chip-seq data and the gene expression profiles revealed that genes sharing similar binding patterns of the main factors may still have distinctive expression patterns, leading to our hypothesis of existence of cofactors. the k-means clustering was employed in this step.

 <dig>  we then constructed features characterizing co-binding effects of main factors and a cofactor candidate on their potential target genes. in order to integrate genomic information of cofactor candidates with the main factor binding data, we scanned genome regions defined by the chip-seq coordinates with a set of known tf motifs to identify co-localization of binding sites of main factors and a cofactor candidate in the genome; next, we computed a feature score for a gene and a feature--a combination of  main factors and a cofactor candidate--such a score intends to quantify association strength between a gene and a co-binding combination, giving a numerical summary of the genomic sequence information and the chip-seq data for the gene.

 <dig>  through hypothesis tests, we identified features which have significantly different distributions between es-up genes and es-down genes representing genes up- and down-regulated in es cells, respectively . by checking expression profiles of a cofactor candidate involved in a feature, we reasoned its regulatory role based on test results. two-sample proportion test and the wilcoxon rank-sum test were used, with the false discovery rate  controlled by the benjamini-hochberg procedure  <cit> .

 <dig>  regarding es-up and es-down genes as two classes of genes and significant features identified in the last step as predictors, we adopted gene classification with na√Øve bayes classifiers to further choose a small subset of features, which suggest cofactor candidates through involved tf combinations.

 <dig>  finally, we predicted target genes of tfs involved in selected features by perturbing learned classifiers and examining change in classification. we reported consistent evidence supporting our prediction from another independent data set. the purpose of this practice is to provide supplementary validation of cofactor candidates revealed by selected features via the target prediction.

for brevity, we refer to cofactor candidates as cofactors.

RESULTS
hypothesis of existence of cofactors
we first define gene sets of our interest and introduce some existing findings about the main factors based on the chip-seq data, and then present their interplay results to motivate our hypothesis of existence of cofactors and further analyses.

es-up and es-down genes
zhou et al.  <cit>  produced gene expression profiles at es-cell stage and early differentiated stage, including  <dig> profiles of undifferentiated es cells ,  <dig> profiles of 2-, 4-, 8-day embryoid bodies with high oct <dig> expression, and  <dig> profiles of 2-, 4-, 8-, 15-day embryoid bodies with low oct <dig> expression. regarding high oct <dig> expression as a marker for es cells, we refer to the  <dig> profiles with high oct <dig> expression as samples at es stage and the remaining profiles as samples at df  stage. two gene sets have been identified: the genes whose expression is higher at es stage than at df stage with a fold change >  <dig> and p-value
<  <dig>  in a two-sample comparison, and the genes that have significantly lower expression at es stage comparing with expression at df stage under the same cutoffs. we refer to the first set of genes as es-up genes and the second set of genes as es-down genes. we call these two sets of genes collectively es genes.

the myc group and the oct <dig> group of the main factors
in the chip-seq data  <cit> , a pair of start and end coordinates specifies a peak location or a binding site of a tf in coarse resolutions, and the number of reads  associated with a peak indicates the intensity of binding signals on the site. the authors showed that oct <dig>  sox <dig>  nanog, smad <dig>  and stat <dig> have different binding patterns from myc and mycn. ouyang et al.  <cit>  reported a similar phenomenon. specifically, they first defined an association score to measure association strength between a gene and a main factor . intuitively, the closer the binding sites  of a main factor to the transcription start site  of the gene, and the stronger the chip-seq signal intensities  on the sites, the higher the association score between the gene and the main factor. through principal components analysis of the association scores of all the main factors, they identified two groups of tfs: the myc group consists of e2f <dig>  zfx, mycn, and myc; the oct <dig> group has oct <dig>  sox <dig>  nanog, smad <dig>  stat <dig>  tcfcp2l <dig>  and esrrb. while the myc group is mainly associated with up-regulated genes in es cells, the oct <dig> group may either activate or repress genes at es stage according to their regression analysis of the association scores and expression data.

gene clusters based on association scores
having learned the differences between these two tf groups, we intended to examine whether genes can be reasonably partitioned according to the association scores. this examination was to check whether a similar binding pattern shared by a set of genes would lead to similar expression of the genes. we applied the k-means clustering to genes based on their association scores with the  <dig> main factors , and chose k =  <dig> as we may expect four clusters of genes associated with the binding of none/either/both of the two groups, leaving an additional cluster accommodating any unexpected binding pattern. figure  <dig> shows the mean association scores for the five clusters and the grand mean association scores over all the genes . we observed distinguished binding patterns among these five clusters. by comparing the mean association scores with the grand means, we see that cluster  <dig> includes genes highly associated with all the tfs; in contrast, cluster  <dig> consists of genes having weak association with all of them. cluster  <dig> has genes more intensively associated with the oct <dig> group than the myc group; in cluster  <dig>  conversely, the myc group shows stronger association than the oct <dig> group; similar to cluster  <dig>  cluster  <dig> contains genes for which the oct <dig> group owns higher association scores than the myc group, although the association is relatively moderate comparing with the association for cluster  <dig>  for future reference, we name the five clusters according to the observed binding patterns: the uniformly-high cluster for cluster  <dig>  the uniformly-low cluster for cluster  <dig>  the oct <dig> cluster for cluster  <dig>  the myc cluster for cluster  <dig>  and the oct4-moderate cluster for cluster  <dig>  we excluded the uniformly-low cluster from further investigation because we were interested in finding cofactors working with the main factors in es cells and all the main factors are weakly associated with the genes in that cluster.

meanwhile, we focus on es genes in these four clusters . our goal is to search for cofactors whose co-binding  to es-up genes and to es-down genes in a cluster are significantly different from each other, and can optimally classify the genes within the cluster.

features and feature scores
a feature is defined as association between genes and a combination of w main factors of interest and one cofactor. such a combination is referred to as a tf combination. we consider three types of features corresponding to w =  <dig>   <dig> and 0: a pair of main factors and a cofactor, a single main factor and a cofactor, and a cofactor alone. whereas a cofactor prefers to co-bind to dna sequences with two or one specific main factor for the first two types of features, respectively, the last type does not indicate such preferences. depending on main factors of interest in a cluster, features involving tf combinations constructed in different clusters are different. for example, for the myc cluster, a tf combination consists of one or two of the main factors of the myc group  and one cofactor. thus, different clusters have different numbers of features. given  <dig> pre-selected potential cofactors , there are  <dig> √ó202) features with w =  <dig> and  <dig> features with w =  <dig> for the uniformly-high cluster. for the oct <dig> and oct4-moderate clusters, there are  <dig> and  <dig> features corresponding to w =  <dig> and w =  <dig>  respectively. for the myc cluster, there are  <dig> features with w =  <dig> and  <dig> features with w =  <dig>  finally, there are  <dig> features involving only cofactors  for all the clusters.

to locate places where a co-binding of a tf combination may happen, we identified genomic regions that contain at least two binding sites of main factors of interest in the chip-seq data. such a genomic region is called a neighborhood. please see methods for neighborhood construction and additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> for neighborhood summary statistics such as their lengths and distances to tss's. as mentioned above, for different clusters, features are different depending on different main factors of interest, and thus different subsets of the chip-seq data were used for neighborhood construction. for example, the chip-seq data of e2f <dig>  mycn, zfx, and myc were used for the myc cluster. we then scanned the neighborhoods with the  <dig> pre-selected tf motifs from transfac  <dig>   <cit>  and de novo motif discovery to detect possible binding sites of these potential cofactors .

next, a neighborhood is associated with a gene if its center is within d bps of the gene's tss . given a gene and its associated neighborhoods containing binding sites of main factors and a cofactor involved in a tf combination, we computed a feature score to quantify the association strength between the tf combination and the gene . intuitively, a greater feature score is due to a shorter distance from the location of the tf combination to the tss and/or a stronger binding strength of the combination.

if a tf combination cannot be associated with a gene because it does not occur in any associated neighborhood of the gene, we say that the feature score between this combination and the gene does not exist .

feature significance
for each feature, we employed two-sample comparisons to test whether the feature score distribution of es-up genes is significantly different from the distribution of es-down genes. specifically, the wilcoxon rank-sum test was utilized to test whether the feature scores in one gene set are significantly greater than the feature scores in the other ; two-sample proportion test was used to test whether the proportion of the genes associated with a tf combination  in one gene set is significantly greater than that in the other.

for each type of features, many features lead to a multiple testing problem for each kind of test.  we collected significant features under an fdr cutoff of 10%. we define an es-up feature as a feature that shows a higher proportion in es-up genes than that in es-down genes or has significantly higher scores in es-up genes than es-down genes. an es-down feature is defined in an analogous way. table  <dig> summarizes the number of significant features in each cluster . for the oct <dig> cluster, there are only a few significant features with w =  <dig> but many more significant features with w =  <dig> or  <dig>  for the myc cluster and the oct4-moderate cluster, there are also more significant features involving a tf combination than features involving only a cofactor. the result demonstrates that we would have ignored important features if we only considered cofactors alone, and that the constructed features are effective to capture a cofactor's preference for co-binding with main factors for potential gene regulation.

note: w denotes the number of main factors, indicating feature types.

interestingly, almost all significant es-up features were discovered by the rank-sum test. this fact may suggest activation of genes at es stage is more likely to happen when a tf combination is located closer to tss's, and/or it has a stronger binding strength. in contrast, all significant es-down features were identified by two-sample proportion test. this phenomenon indicates that the occurrence of a particular tf combination may be sufficient to increase the chance of down-regulation at es stage--neither its location nor its strength makes differences. since utilizing features in continuous and binary fashions informs us different meanings, both are useful and should be considered together.

we can reason regulatory roles of a cofactor involved in a significant feature by checking its fold change in the expression profiles and checking whether the feature is an es-up or es-down feature. fold change in the expression profiles is said to be positive if the ratio of the mean expression at es stage over the mean expression at df stage >  <dig>  and negative if the ratio <  <dig> . by its definition, an es-up feature is significantly associated with genes that are up-regulated at es-stage . therefore, if a cofactor involved in an es-up feature shows positive fold change, it may play an activator role in es cells. on the other hand, if the cofactor is active at df stage, suggested by its negative fold change, it may repress genes at df stage. for a cofactor with neither positive fold change nor negative fold change, it may show uniformly high expression, defined by average expression index >  <dig> at both es and df stages, and thus may function at both stages. in this case, we may not tell its role as an activator at es stage from an repressor at df stage. following the same logic, we can reason the roles of a cofactor involved in an es-down feature as either a repressor at es stage and/or an activator at df stage. table  <dig> summarizes the above reasoning.

feature selection
based on the significant results we obtained, we further selected a small subset of features with gene classification, where top features ranked by their significance  were treated as predictors in a na√Øve bayes  classifier and es-up and es-down genes as two classes .

since es-up and es-down features indicate different biological meanings, we hoped to incorporate information from both es-up and es-down features into predictors. to reduce potential combinations of three types of es-up features  and three types of es-down features as indicated by six columns in table  <dig>  we restricted our search strategy to combining only one type of es-up features and only one type of es-down features, and thus there are a total of  <dig>  combinations to be examined. specifically, we used top k <dig> es-up features  ranked by their p-values and top k <dig> es-down features  as k  predictors in an nb classifier. figure  <dig> illustrates the situation where we examined a combination of one type of es-up features  and one type of es-down features  based on ten-fold cross-validation . it shows that the classification accuracy for enumeration of the two types of features for the oct <dig> cluster, where on average the combination of top six es-up features and top two es-down features achieves the highest accuracy . the decreasing trend of the accuracy can also be observed as k <dig> and k <dig> increase from six and two, respectively. similar enumeration was conducted for the remaining eight combinations of feature types, and the combination with the minimum cv error was selected. please see methods for details of the feature enumeration procedure we employed given two types of features.

note: nb_mf--classification with nb classifiers based on only main factors; cart--classification with cart based on three principal components of association scores of main factors as in  <cit> ; nb--classification with nb classifiers utilizing both main factors and cofactors.

there is little improvement by utilizing cofactor information in the uniformly-high cluster and the oct4-moderate cluster. it may be due to more evident imbalance between es-up and es-down genes in each of the two clusters than the other two clusters--73% es-up genes in the uniformly-high cluster and 72% es-down genes in the oct4-moderate cluster. the dominant gene sets may suggest that gene clustering based on the association scores  already partitions the genes well for these two clusters so that the contribution from features involving cofactors is marginal for further classification.

note: uh cluster is shorthand for the uniformly-high cluster; oct4-m cluster is shorthand for the oct4-moderate cluster. the column "es u/d" indicates whether a feature is an es-up feature  or an es-down feature . locuslinks, cofactor gene names, and fold change  of gene expression  of cofactors are listed correspondingly. the column "ls" indicates related literature support for a feature.

although features involving two main factors and one cofactor are not selected for other clusters, the two es-down features for the oct <dig> cluster are of this type. in addition, except the oct4-moderate cluster, there are features involving one main factor and one cofactor in all the other clusters. not only these features show strong statistical significance , but also they are useful from the classification perspective. the evidence from these aspects suggests that the cofactors involved in these features are likely to be regulators in es cells.

literature support
for more than one third of the features in table  <dig>  existing literatures provide supporting evidence of related biological functions. we list relevant literatures for specific features in the last column of the table. here we present support for some features in detail. reported in the oct <dig> cluster, rela, which binds to m00052_nfkb sites, was inferred to co-bind with stat <dig> and smad <dig> for activating genes at df stage. lee et al.  <cit>  suggested that rela, p <dig>  and stat <dig> are in the same dna-binding complex in tumors. in addition, they provided related references showing that rela and stat <dig> stimulate a highly overlapping repertoire of prosurvival, proliferative, and proangiogenic genes. the above findings show that the collaboration exists between stat <dig> and rela, and our analyses further reveal that there is a need for these two tfs to work with smad <dig> in order to regulate genes in es cells . the feature smad <dig> stat <dig> m00415_areb6_ <dig> involves zeb <dig>  which binds to m00415_areb6_ <dig> sites, and smad <dig>  which is a receptor-regulated smad  and a key component of the bmp signaling pathway  <cit> . consistently, postigo et al.  <cit>  found that zeb <dig> synergizes with smad-mediated transcriptional activation and regulates bmp signaling, and that r-smad and zeb <dig> form a complex that recruits p <dig> much more efficiently, thus accounting for their transcriptional synergy. these results support smad <dig> and m00415_areb6_ <dig> in the identified regulatory code, but stat <dig> is necessary for them to receive special attention for es cell studies--the significance of the feature smad <dig> m00415_areb6_ <dig>  is not as strong as the reported three-tf feature .

according to gata6's inferred role from the feature nanog.m00462_gata6_01--a repressor at df stage, it may repress genes activated by nanog at es stage. this exemplifies the situation where a main factor and a cofactor in an identified tf combination may not always work with each other at the same time. the above reasoning is in line with one of the findings in  <cit> , which demonstrated that antagonism between nanog and gata <dig> leads to segregation of epiblast and primitive endoderm within inner cell mass, and that an excess of gata <dig> pushes the cell into the endoderm lineage.

we now discuss some studies on cofactors identified for the myc cluster. consistent with the inferred role of otx <dig> as a repressor at es stage, the results in  <cit>  revealed that otx <dig> regulates neuronal progenitor domains by repressing nkx <dig>  in the ventral midbrain. in another study  <cit> , puelles et al. suggested that otx <dig> represses gabaergic differentiation to control glutamatergic progenitors of the thalamus. another predicted repressor at es stage, trp <dig>  induces differentiation of mouse es cells via suppressing nanog expression  <cit> . we reasoned that pparg activates genes at df stage. indeed, it is one of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors , a group of three nuclear receptor isoforms interacting with other factors to increase transcription initiation rate  <cit> .

although klf <dig> is dispensable for maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency of es cells, concurrent depletion of klf <dig>  klf <dig>  and klf <dig> leads to es cell differentiation  <cit> . hall et al.  <cit>  showed that oct <dig> mainly induces klf <dig> and lif/stat <dig> selectively enhances klf <dig> expression. our study revealed that the binding sites of these klfs are preferentially enriched in the neighborhoods associated with the es-down genes in the myc cluster, suggesting possible cooperation between the oct <dig> group and the myc group via klfs on gene repression in es cells--oct4/stat <dig> may introduce klfs that cooperate with the members of the myc group.

in tune with rbpj's reasoned role as an activator from the feature m01111_rbpjk_q <dig> discovered in the oct4-moderate cluster, the intracellular part of the cell surface notch <dig> receptor  alters the function of rbpjŒ∫ to be a transcription activator  <cit> . additionally, robert-moreno et al.  <cit>  showed that activation of gata <dig> expression by notch1/rbpjŒ∫ is essential for the onset of definitive hematopoiesis in the mouse embryo. our analysis suggested that zic <dig> may be a transcriptional regulator at es stage. lim et al.  <cit>  established that repression of zic <dig> in es cells induces expression of several markers of the endodermal lineage and leads to significant reduction of nanog expression, and thus zic <dig> plays an important role in the maintenance of pluripotency by preventing endodermal lineage specification in es cells. zic <dig> may activate repressors of the endoderm markers and thus works as an activator in es cells. given the above evidence from the existing literatures, other identified cofactors may also play some unknown roles at es/df stages, and thus may be worth follow-up experimental verification.

support by target prediction
based on the formulation of an nb classifier, we predicted target genes that are regulated by tfs involved in a feature. the prediction is through checking the change in the probability ratio for classification after a feature is excluded from predictors of a classifier that employs the selected features . to provide evidence for predicted targets, we checked gene expression profiles of identified cofactors and their predicted targets in another data set--the rai  data  <cit> . gene expression was profiled for  <dig> days when es cells underwent retinoic-acid-induced differentiation. we treated day  <dig> as es stage and day 4- <dig> as df stage, and computed fold change of the expression profile of day  <dig> over the mean expression of day 4- <dig> as in  <cit> . we then checked whether fold change of an identified cofactor in the rai data matches its fold change in our study. besides exact match, we allowed uniformly high status in one data set to match positive/negative fold change in the other because the status indicates potential functioning of a cofactor at both stages.

if a match is found, expression change of predicted targets is checked for validation: according to our analysis, it is expected that expression of targets of an activator at es stage and/or a repressor at df stage  should decrease after differentiation, and conversely, expression of targets of a repressor at es stage and/or an activator at df stage should increase. the proportion of targets whose observed expression satisfied the above expectation is high, ranging from 61% to 92%, as shown by pc in table  <dig>  where selected quantiles of targets' fold change for each feature are also presented for reference. based on this consistent result, the target-prediction practice further supports the identified cofactors and their regulatory roles.

note: fc_rai is fold change of cofactor expression. nb is the number of predicted targets for a feature. ne is the number of targets having expression available in  <cit> . pc is the proportion of ne genes with expected expression change. 1q, median, and 3q are, respectively, the 1st quartile, the median, and the 3rd quartile of targets' fold change, which is inverted for es-down features for convenient comparison.

among all the predicted targets, an interesting category is the ones that themselves are main factors or identified cofactors, indicating cascade regulatory pathways. noticeably, multiple targets in this category are observed for each of the three combinations selected in the uniformly-high cluster : otx <dig>  klf <dig>  tcfcp2l <dig>  pou5f <dig>  and trp <dig> are potential targets of e2f <dig> and mef2a; otx <dig>  pou5f <dig>  trp <dig>  and sox <dig> are possibly regulated by sox <dig> and smad <dig> or smad2; klf <dig>  tcfcp2l <dig>  pou5f <dig>  trp <dig>  and sox <dig> are among the predicted targets of esrrb and elf <dig> or elf <dig> or gabpa. other clusters do not show this phenomenon. it implies that genes in the uniformly-high cluster  may play important roles in forming complex network structure and should receive particular attention when modeling regulatory networks is the goal of a study. consistently, the three related top go terms enriched in the targets of this cluster are: negative regulation of biological process, regulation of developmental process, and regulation of cell differentiation.

we summarize biological implications of our results as follows: based on the definitions of es-up/-down features, we inferred the regulatory roles of the potential cofactors involved in the reported features , some of which are supported by relevant literatures; the gene-classification practice shows that the identified tf combinations may explain the gene expression; the expected expression change of the predicted targets in another data set adds more confidence in the inferred regulators' function. the results of this study can provide new clues to expand the core regulatory network among main factors and to identify novel combinatorial regulation of the rich expression profiles in mouse es cells.

discussion
although the classification improvement of our approach for the oct <dig> cluster and the myc cluster comparing to the other methods in table  <dig> is substantial and encouraging, the absolute cv errors are quite high. such results could be due to the following reasons. first, as shown in table  <dig>  there are more significant features than what has been enumerated under our search strategy. some of them are biologically meaningful in explaining gene expression, and thus have the potential to further reduce classification errors. for example, the neuronal repressor rest is involved in the es-down feature oct <dig> smad <dig> m00325_nrse_b  for the oct <dig> cluster, which suggests rest collaborating with the key tfs oct <dig> and smad <dig> for gene down-regulation at es stage. in line with its repressor role, this cofactor has been shown to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency in mouse es cells through suppression of the microrna mir- <dig>  <cit> . thus, this es-down feature may be worth further investigation. however, one challenging question is how features like this can be discovered; simply increasing the number of top features in nb classifiers may include many noisy features and thus degrade classification performance according to our experience. therefore, procedures with stronger selective power are needed. second, sophisticated learning methods such as boosting and bayesian additive regression trees  may have better classification performance , but these methods may have difficulties in interpretation of their results. in the framework we employed, not only do the statistical tests help reduce search space by focusing on significant features for feature selection in classification, but they also provide ground for biologically meaningful interpretations of features as we have discussed in the section of feature significance. third, although in this study we focused on tf regulatory control, tf binding is only one way of gene regulation. other mechanisms such as dna methylation are also involved in regulating gene expression. lack of their information may lead to low classification accuracy. thus, readers should treat our report in this study as intermediate results--further investigation of this challenging classification problem is needed.

in the current framework, we consider features involving only one cofactor and up to two main factors. further extension to more cofactors and main factors is possible, and the extension may gain additional capacity to differentiate the gene expression patterns. however, with more and more specific tf combinations, the support  may become less and less, and thus the gained capacity may not be detected. on the other hand, the extension will lead to combinatorial explosion. for example, including one more cofactor will bring ~ <dig> times more features into consideration. this will result in much more tests for each feature type, which may cause high fdr for the current data size. in addition, following the logic of combinatorial regulatory codes, another kind of features would be a pair of main factors without considering a cofactor in our framework. alternatively, one could treat one main factor as a cofactor of the other main factor. we explored this possibility and found that little improvement can be made in gene classification. this may be because classification happens within each gene cluster and collaborative efforts among main factors have already been captured by clustering.

besides es genes, other genes with less substantial fold change, referred to as es-neutral genes, may also be informative. if the function of a tf combination is only to activate genes in es cells, we expect that the contrast in the feature between es-up and es-down genes may be more significant than the contrast between es-up genes and es-neutral genes. the reason is that the tf combination may have a lower chance to randomly occupy regulatory elements of an es-down gene  than an es-neutral gene, which may be activated but has insignificant fold change. similarly, focusing on es genes may be helpful for detecting a tf combination as a pure es repressor. on the other hand, if a particular combination works as either an activator or a repressor in es cells depending on other cellular context or targets, a feature may then be strongly associated with both es-up and es-down genes, leading to insignificant test results and defeating detection. in this case, the es-neutral gene set, containing genes that are not regulated by the combination, may provide a better contrast for detecting such a combination. the detection may be conducted in the same framework with one of es gene sets replaced by es-neutral genes. in summary, many possible directions can be explored based on this study.

CONCLUSIONS
this study suggests a list of tf combinations which may play important regulatory roles in es cells based on computational analyses. they serve as top candidates for experimental evaluation. we provided computational evidence of the finding from three aspects:  <dig>  the features involving identified tf combinations show strong statistical significance;  <dig>  the classifiers based on them have the optimal performance in classifying gene expression and also achieve substantial improvement over classifiers utilizing only main factor information;  <dig>  their predicted target genes  in another independent data set show expected fold change as in our prediction. in addition to the above evidence, existing literatures provide support for reasoned regulatory roles of some identified cofactors. in summary, this study effectively reveals combinatorial co-binding patterns which involve potential regulators in mouse es cells.
