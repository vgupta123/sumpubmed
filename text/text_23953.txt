BACKGROUND
natural selection alters the local genomic environment around newly evolved sex-determination loci in two ways. first, selection favors the accumulation of sexually antagonistic alleles and their association with the appropriate x- or y-haplotype. second, selection also favors a reduction in the rate of recombination between the proto-x and proto-y to preserve the associations between the sexually antagonistic alleles and the sex-determination locus  <cit> . the process is cyclic, in that selection will favor the recruitment of additional sexually antagonistic loci within a growing region of reduced recombination  <cit> . once a region of reduced recombination is established, deleterious mutations will begin to accumulate via muller’s ratchet  <cit> . through these mechanisms, the region of differentiation between the x- and y-chromosome grows, creating a series of evolutionary strata from the oldest and most decayed regions to the newest and least decayed  <cit> . structural rearrangements, such as inversions, are one mechanism that reduces recombination and contributes to the creation of evolutionary strata on sex chromosomes  <cit> .

the initial sex-determination loci are buried within the oldest evolutionary strata because the first selectively favored chromosomal rearrangement encompasses both the sex-determination locus and at least one sexually antagonistic locus. traditional genetic mapping techniques cannot be used to fine map the sex-determination locus because of the lack of recombination inside these structural polymorphisms. an alternative approach is to identify shared ancestral polymorphisms inside the deepest and most decayed stratum among species that share a common ancestral sex-determination mechanism.

cichlid fishes are a model system for studying evolutionary processes  <cit> . sex-determination has evolved rapidly among african cichlids. sex-determination loci have been identified on linkage groups   <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  among species of tilapia, and on linkage groups  <dig> ,  <dig>  and possibly others in haplochromine cichlids . the sex determination locus on lg <dig> appears to be a duplication of amh, but the sex-determination genes on the other chromosomes have not yet been identified  <cit> .

previous studies have mapped the sex-determination locus on linkage group  <dig> in the nile tilapia  to a region of a few centimorgans . we recently identified a high density of sex-patterned snps on lg <dig> in the region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb  <cit> . this  <dig>  mb region is significantly enriched for missense mutations and likely corresponds to an inversion that restricts recombination between the x- and y-chromosomes.

the blackchin tilapia, sarotherodon melanotheron, is a sister group to the genus oreochromis  <cit>  and has received relatively little attention with respect to sex-determination. one study reported that the chromosomes of s. melanotheron were homomorphic with a chromosome count consistent with that of other species of oreochromis  <cit> . in this study we identify the sex-determination region in s. melanotheron, characterize the shared regions of differentiation on lg <dig> between o. niloticus and s. melanotheron and catalog shared snps that may be responsible for sex-determination in these species.

methods
materials

sarotherodon melanotheron were originally collected from lake guiers, senegal. the individuals sampled are the 4th generation progeny of the wild-caught fish. fins were sampled from a total of  <dig> male and  <dig> female fish and preserved in a salt-dmso preservation solution. the sex ratio of the family was 50: <dig> 

sequencing
dna was extracted from each fin-clip by phenol-chloroform extraction using phase-lock gel tubes . dna concentrations were measured by fluorescence spectrometry and normalized during library preparation. dna from  <dig> males and  <dig> females were then separately pooled . sequencing libraries were constructed using the truseq dna pcr-free lt kit . a full lane of illumina 183 bp paired-end sequencing was performed for each sex.

for comparative analyses, we reanalyzed whole genome sequencing data for male and female oreochromis niloticus from our previous study  <cit> . these data consist of 100 bp paired-end reads from separate male and female dna pools.

read mapping
reads that did not pass illumina casava  <dig>  filtering were removed. read qualities for both lanes were analyzed using fastqc  <cit> . the reads were then mapped to the o. niloticus reference assembly with bowtie <dig> using the --very-sensitive setting and a minimum insert length of 200 bp  <cit> . variants were called using gatk in the unifiedgenotyper mode  <cit> . read qualities with a phred score of at least  <dig> were required for variant calling.

identification of sex-patterned snps
a custom script was used to identify sites showing a sex-patterned signature. sex_snp_finder_ga.pl is an expansion of the sex_snp_finder_now.pl script released previously  <cit> . sex-patterned snps are sites that are fixed or nearly fixed in the homogametic sex and in a frequency between  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the heterogametic sex. we required a minimum read depth of ten and a minimum allele count of two. we assessed the overall density of sex-patterned snps in 10 kb non-overlapping windows. we also counted regions enriched for sex-patterned snps by identifying non-overlapping 10 kb windows containing at least  <dig> sex-patterned snps.

in addition to finding sex-patterned snps, the updated script calculates fst, dxy, da, nei’s d and cp for each nucleotide position across the genome. fst is calculated in accordance with the method used in popoolation <dig>  except that we calculated values at each site instead of by windows  <cit> . due to numeric difficulties handling the upper bound of nei’s d, the calculation is modified for alternatively fixed positions to make the calculation based upon the maximum coverage level specified by the user. cp is a metric of population differentiation that ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> , where x
i and y
i are the frequencies of each allele in populations x and y  <cit> . cp=∑i=1n12|xi−yi| 


functional annotation
the functional significance of sex-patterned snps was evaluated with snpeff and snpsift using the gene annotations obtained from ncbi   <cit> . we excluded mrna models that did not have full-length protein coding sequences. non-synonymous substitutions were subsequently evaluated with provean to predict functional impacts on protein structure  <cit> . three missense mutations, r203c in xm_ <dig>  , e1235v in xm_ <dig>   and g215a in xm_ <dig>  , were excluded from the provean analysis due to low quality gene annotations as defined by provean. missense mutations harboring provean scores less than the recommended threshold of − <dig>  were considered deleterious.

identification of shared sex-specific snps
sex-patterned snps in s. melanotheron were compared to the sex-patterned snps identified in o. niloticus, which also segregates a sex-determination system on lg <dig>  the null hypothesis for the expected number of shared sex-patterned snps was calculated by multiplying the frequency of sex-patterned snps within the previously identified region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb on lg <dig> in o. niloticus, by the frequency of sex-patterned snps within the same region in s. melanotheron by the size of the region.

transcription factor binding site analysis
snps that were sex-patterned and shared between o. niloticus and s. melanotheron were inspected to ensure that they shared common x- and y-alleles. flanking regions for the snps passing this criteria were extracted using bedtools and compared to the jaspar core vertebrata  <dig> database to identify possible transcription factor binding sites  <cit> . a jaspar relative score threshold of  <dig>  was used to assess the significance of putative binding sites.

identification of copy number variants
copy number variation within the s. melanotheron and o. niloticus datasets was assessed with varscan  <dig>  using a minimum window size of 100 bp, a maximum window size of 1 kb and amp and del thresholds equal to  <dig>   <cit> . a custom script  was developed to find conserved copy number variants between n-number of varscan  <dig> comparisions  <cit> . we then utilized a non-overlapping window approach, which excluded assembly gaps from the windows, to quantify the density of these conserved copy number variants within 10 kb windows across the genome.

statistical assessment
mann–whitney u-tests were used to determine if a region was enriched for sex-patterned snps or conserved copy number variants. all testing used 10 kb non-overlapping windows as samples. a bonferroni correction was applied to control for  <dig> comparisons resulting in a significance threshold of α= <dig> .

RESULTS
sequencing and mapping of reads
we obtained a total of ~ <dig> million and ~ <dig> million 183 bp paired-end reads from the female and male pools of s. melanotheron, respectively. the alignment rates to the o. niloticus reference sequence were  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively. the mean coverage in the female pool was  <dig>  reads, while the mean coverage in the male pool was  <dig>  reads.

we obtained a total of ~ <dig> million and ~ <dig> million 100 bp paired-end reads from the female and male pools of o. niloticus, respectively. the alignment rates to the o. niloticus reference were  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively. the mean coverage in the female pool was  <dig>  reads, while coverage in the male pool was  <dig>  reads.

fst differentiation in s. melanotheron
examination of the whole genome fst plot comparing male and female s. melanotheron identifies a strong signal on lg <dig> . a closer examination of lg <dig> reveals that this region overlaps with the previously identified xy sex-determination region in o. niloticus . the region of divergence on lg <dig> is broader in s. melanotheron than in o. niloticus and spans from approximately  <dig>  to 28 mb. the boundaries of the differentiated region in s. melanotheron are gradual, unlike the sharp boundaries found in o. niloticus on lg <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb.fig.  <dig> whole genome survey of a fst in s. melanotheron, b sex-patterned snps in s. melanotheron, c fst in o. niloticus and d sex-patterned snps in o. niloticus

sex-patterned snps
we found a total of  <dig>  snps in s. melanotheron and  <dig>  snps in o. niloticus fitting the sex-patterned criteria. there were  <dig> and  <dig> non-overlapping 10 kb windows with at least  <dig> sex-patterned snps in s. melanotheron and o. niloticus, respectively . the highest densities of sex-patterned snps occurred between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb in both o. niloticus and s. melanotheron. sex-patterned snps found on lg <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb are at significantly higher densities in this region than any other region in either species .

in s. melanotheron, the region on lg <dig> from  <dig>  to 28 mb, as well as lg <dig>  both showed a significantly higher density of sex-patterned snps when compared to the rest of the genome . the region on lg <dig> from  <dig>  to 28 mb also demonstrated a significantly higher density of sex-patterned snps than lg <dig> . in o. niloticus, the region on lg <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb showed a significantly higher density of sex-patterned snps than the rest of the genome .

functional impacts
we evaluated the functional impacts of the sex-patterned snps and found a total of  <dig> missense and  <dig> synonymous mutations in s. melanotheron. table  <dig> shows the average fst across all polymorphic snps within each region as well as the genomic distribution of each subset of the sex-patterned snps: total sex-patterned snps, 10 kb windows enriched for sex-patterned snps, missense snps, missense snps with a provean score less than − <dig>  and synonymous mutations. the density of each class of sex-patterned snps in s. melanotheron was consistently from highest to lowest: lg <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb, lg <dig> between  <dig>  and 28 mb, lg <dig>  then across the rest of the genome. there were seven stop codon gains or losses, but only one mapped to a region of divergence on lg <dig> .

in o. niloticus we identified a total of  <dig> missense and  <dig> synonymous mutations. the density of each class of sex-patterned snps in o. niloticus was consistently from highest to lowest: lg <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb, lg <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb, then across the rest of the genome. there were six stop codon gains or losses, but none mapped to the regions of divergence . these counts differ slightly from gammerdinger et al.,  <dig> due to a difference in the gene annotation versions used. there were no conserved stop codon gains or losses between s. melanotheron and o. niloticus.

copy number variants
we identified a significantly higher density of conserved duplications and deletions between o. niloticus and s. melanotheron on both lg <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb  and lg <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb  when each is compared to the rest of the genome. however, we did not detect any significant difference in the density of duplications and deletions conserved between the species in these divergent regions on lg <dig> 

shared snps
there are  <dig> sex-patterned snps conserved between s. melanotheron and o. niloticus, compared to the null expectation of  <dig>  conserved snps. we examined all  <dig> positions to confirm that the x- and y-alleles were consistent in the two species. there were  <dig> snps where the x- and y-alleles are switched between species . eight sites showed a pattern where the y-alleles are different but the x-alleles were the same in each lineage. this narrowed the list to  <dig> snps where the x- and y-alleles were shared between the two species. we filtered these  <dig> snps by genomic position. sixteen fell within the region on lg <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb, one lay on lg <dig> and four fell on unanchored scaffolds . of these shared snps, none were missense mutations and only one was a synonymous mutation. the rest were located in non-coding regions. we identified shared sex-patterned snps within 20 kb of two previously identified candidate genes for sex-determination on lg <dig>  <cit> . one was 19 kb downstream of wilms’ tumor protein and the other was 5 kb downstream of ras association domain containing protein  <dig> 

we used jaspar to examine a short region flanking each of the  <dig> shared sex-patterned snps for transcription factor binding sites . a sex-patterned snp at position  <dig> , <dig> on lg <dig>  near wilms’ tumor protein, resulted in a loss of a gata <dig> binding site. the sex-patterned snp at  <dig> , <dig> on lg <dig>  near ras association domain containing protein  <dig> did not alter binding sites for any transcription factor binding sites known to be involved in the sex-determination network .

discussion
evidence for a shared lg <dig> sex-determination mechanism between  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb
the initial line of evidence that s. melanotheron shares an ancestral sex-determination mechanism with o. niloticus is the overlap of the region harboring sex-determination on lg <dig> . convergence for sex-determination within the same  <dig>  mb region within a 927 mb genome, while possible, seems unlikely. this region also contains the highest density of sex-patterned snps across the genome in both species. the high density of sex-patterned snps explains the elevated sex-related fst witnessed within this region. furthermore, the copy number variant analysis demonstrates that the region on lg <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb is not significantly more divergent than the region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb, but it does have significantly more conserved insertions and deletions compared to the rest of the genome. lastly, the number of shared sex-patterned snps is several times more than expected by chance . collectively, the evidence strongly suggests the idea that o. niloticus and s. melanotheron share a common ancestral sex-determination mechanism on lg <dig> 

evidence for a shared sexually antagonistic locus on lg <dig> between  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb
the region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb on lg <dig> has a moderately strong signal of differentiation between males and females in both lineages. the region from  <dig>  to 28 mb in s. melanotheron includes this region and is the second most densely sex-patterned snp region in the genome. the region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb does not have significantly more conserved insertions and deletions than the region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb, but it does have significantly more conserved insertions and deletions when compared to the rest of the genome. this suggests that the block of differentiation between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb has a shared deep history with the sex-determination region.

within this region, we found no shared snps with a consistent allelic pattern between o. niloticus and s. melanotheron, but there was a sex-patterned locus in both species where the x- and y-alleles were switched. this suggests that there could have been an ancestral polymorphism that was alternatively sorted during speciation and the emergence of the sex chromosome. the evidence suggests that the diverged region on lg <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb was present during the initial divergence of sex-determination ancestral to both o. niloticus and s. melanotheron on lg <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb.

this linked, differentiated region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb may harbor a sexually antagonistic locus. however, the sequence between these regions of divergence, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb, shows differentiation in s. melanotheron, but not in o. niloticus. previous theoretical work has suggested that sexually antagonistic loci can be in linkage disequilibrium with the sex-determination locus over large distances while not showing strong signs of differentiation between the two loci  <cit> . it appears that o. niloticus has potentially maintained linkage disequilibrium between these two pockets of differentiation, while s. melanotheron has accumulated mutations across this entire region. this theoretical prediction also postulates that the sexually antagonistic region should have a lower level of divergence than the sex-determination region. this proposition is consistent with the data collected in o. niloticus.

from our data, it is unclear if the intervening region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb diverged initially and then recombination was restored in the o. niloticus lineage or if these were initially two separate regions of divergence held together by sexually antagonistic selection and recombination was subsequently reduced across the entire region in the s. melanotheron lineage. figure  <dig> illustrates the latter sequence of events, but the former sequence of events is also plausible. sequences of more species harboring the lg <dig> sex-determination system might distinguish these two hypotheses.fig.  <dig> proposed model for the evolution of the linkage group  <dig> sex-determination system in tilapia




alternatively, this region could represent a misassembly in the o. niloticus reference genome or a y-specific structural rearrangement.

evidence for speciation soon after sex chromosome emergence
of the  <dig> loci that demonstrate a sex-patterned profile in both data sets,  <dig> loci had the x- and y-alleles conserved, while  <dig> loci had x- and y-alleles switched. the  <dig> conserved x- and y-alleles indicate that this sex chromosome had a shared ancestry between o. niloticus and s. melanotheron. the  <dig> loci where the x- and y-alleles were switched, indicate that this period of shared ancestry was limited, and that some sites that underwent alternative lineage sorting as the proto-x and proto-y were diverging. this indicates that speciation occurred soon after sex chromosome divergence.

evidence for structural rearrangements and their timing
the pronounced boundaries of divergence, high densities of sex-patterned snps and predicted deleterious mutations above the background level in o. niloticus, when taken together with the knowledge that chromosomes of this species are homomorphic in cytogenetic analyses, provide strong evidence for an inversion between the x- and y-chromosomes in o. niloticus  <cit> . the absence of similar sharp boundaries in s. melanotheron, along with lower densities of sex-patterned snps and predicted deleterious mutations, suggest that this inversion is likely not present in the s. melanotheron lineage. we suggest the most parsimonious scenario is that this inversion arose following the divergence of o. niloticus and s. melanotheron.

the differentiation between males and females on lg <dig> of s. melanotheron suggests an association between this linkage group and sex-determination. while the levels of differentiation are lower than those witnessed on lg <dig> between  <dig>  and 28 mb, lg <dig> has a high density of sex-patterned deleterious mutations and the overall level of differentiation is significantly higher than the genomic background. currently, this patterned is consistent with four hypotheses: 1) the signal could be the result of a reciprocal translocation of similar sized fragments between lg <dig> and lg <dig> after the divergence of o. niloticus and s. melanotheron. a previous karyotyping study has concluded that the chromosomes are homomorphic and that s. melanotheron have the same chromosome count as o. niloticus, but this study might have failed to detect such a translocation  <cit> . 2) lg <dig> is in linkage disequilibrium with the lg <dig> xy system. this seems unlikely because of the strong selection needed to overcome linkage disequilibrium between two independently assorting chromosomes. 3) a region on lg <dig> epistatically contributes to sex-determination within lg <dig> in this family. multiple sex-determination systems have been observed in some cichlid species, however no sex-determination loci been previously reported from lg <dig> in cichlids  <cit> . 4) the signal could be an artifact of the sampling structure. this also seems unlikely as it would suppose that two copies of lg <dig> were segregating in the family and that males disproportionately received more of one copy and females received almost none of that copy by chance meiotic events. we suggest that a reciprocal translocation from lg <dig> to lg <dig> following the divergence of s. melanotheron and o. niloticus is the most likely scenario for explaining the observed patterned of sex-patterned differentiation on lg <dig>  future cytogenetic studies may provide data to test this hypothesis.

we summarize our findings by proposing a model for the evolution of the lg <dig> sex chromosome in tilapia . the sex-determination mechanism resided on lg <dig> in the common ancestor of o. niloticus and s. melanotheron. early stages of sex differentiation encompassed a region on lg <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb. the region from either  <dig>  or  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb was maintained in linkage disequilibrium with sex-determination locus by sexually antagonistic selection  <cit> . due to a lack of shared snps between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb, we are unable to determine whether this region was originally not part of the diverging region and recombination was reduced only in the s. melanotheron lineage  or this region was originally part of a block of divergence and recombination was restored to it in the o. niloticus lineage. oreochromis niloticus and s. melanotheron diverged shortly after the emergence of the novel sex-determination locus. we propose that in the o. niloticus lineage, the region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb experienced a chromosomal inversion and began to rapidly accumulate mutations. in the s. melanotheron lineage, the region did not experience this inversion and the region of sex differentiation expanded to encompass a region from  <dig>  to 28 mb. in s. melanotheron, lg <dig> may have further experienced a translocation of a region from lg <dig> 

candidate sex-determination mutations
we identified  <dig> shared snps with consistent sex-patterned profiles in s. melanotheron and o. niloticus, which represent candidate sex-determination mutations for this lineage. two of these are located near previously identified sex-determination candidate genes, so we evaluated how these shared sex-patterned snps might alter transcription factor binding sites. the mutation near ras association domain containing protein  <dig> did not affect any transcription factor binding sites known to play a role in sex-determination. the mutation near wilms tumor protein altered a gata <dig> transcription factor binding site. gata <dig> is a transcription factor that has been associated with the sex-determination pathway  <cit> . gata <dig> has been shown to bind in the promoter of the wilms tumor protein in mammals and teleosts and wilms tumor protein is a strong activator of amhr, a known sex-determination gene  <cit> . a y-specific loss of a gata <dig> binding site would decrease transcription of wilms tumor protein in males, which in turn would not activate amhr and result in masculinization. this variant currently represents the strongest snp candidate for sex-determination on lg <dig> and further functional analysis is necessary to assess its role in sex-determination.

our analysis is limited by the inability of the short-read illumina data to clearly resolve the large number of deletions and insertions that are likely present on the y-chromosome. future studies should consider using longer read sequencing technologies to assemble x- and y-specific sequences for both species. it may then be possible to more clearly identify conserved insertion and deletion events on the proto-y chromosome in both species.

CONCLUSIONS
this study utilized a comparative approach in order to identify the ancestral state of the lg <dig> sex-determination locus. we determined that s. melanotheron shares an ancestral xy sex-determination mechanism with o. niloticus. in both species, the highest differentiation between the x- and y-chromosomes is found in the region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb on lg <dig>  we identified  <dig> sex-patterned snps shared between the two species. one of these snps alters a gata <dig> transcription factor binding site near wilms tumor protein, which might alter the function of the sex-determination pathway. future studies should assess the role of this candidate snp in sex-determination. investigation of additional species segregating this sex-determination system on lg <dig> will provide a clearer understanding of evolutionary processes during the early stages of sex chromosome divergence.
