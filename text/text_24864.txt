BACKGROUND
peanut  is an important source of oil and protein, and because of their nutritional benefits and versatility, peanuts and peanut-derived products are used extensively in processed foods. unfortunately, reports of allergic reactions to peanuts are becoming increasingly common, and severe allergic reactions to peanuts can be fatal  <cit> . avoidance is the best strategy to prevent allergic reactions, but due to the prevalence of peanuts in food products, avoidance can be difficult. even food which does not specifically contain peanut products, but was processed on equipment also used for handling peanuts, can still contain significant amounts of allergens to trigger allergic response in some patients. peanuts contain at least  <dig> potentially allergenic proteins, according to the international union of immunological societies   <cit> . knocking out the genes responsible for production of allergenic proteins would be one strategy for reducing the allergic potential of peanuts. however, many of these allergens are seed storage proteins which make up a considerable amount of the total seed protein. major allergen ara h  <dig>  for example, makes up 12-16% of total seed protein, and ara h  <dig> from  <dig> - <dig> %  <cit> . it is unknown how many of these proteins can be eliminated without sacrificing quality or viability, although chu et al.  <cit>  used transgenic silencing to eliminate ara h  <dig> and ara h  <dig> protein in peanut seeds, and observed no adverse effects on viability. though such results are promising, there are many regulatory obstacles which must be overcome for a transgenic peanut to be used as food.

another strategy is to use mutagenesis to knock out the allergen genes, or possibly to alter the sequences of major allergenic epitopes in those proteins. this can be accomplished though tilling , a technique in which a mutagenized population can be screened for individuals carrying mutations in any known gene of interest. tilling is a pcr-based technique which relies on mismatch cleavage by cel <dig> nuclease to identify single-nucleotide or small insertion/deletion mutations. tilling was initially developed as a reverse-genetics tool in the model species arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , but has since been applied to important crop species including rice   <cit> , maize   <cit> , and soybean  merr.)  <cit> , to name just a few.

in a previous study we reported the genomic characterization of the major allergen gene ara h  <dig> <cit> . genes encoding the two isoforms, ara h  <dig>  and ara h  <dig> , are homeologous genes representing orthologs from diploid ancestors, most likely a. duranensis  and a. ipaensis . in this study we show that the major allergen ara h  <dig> gene is also present in two copies, each belonging to separate subgenomes. gene-specific primers were developed to identify mutations in each of the two ara h  <dig> and two ara h  <dig> genes through tilling.

in addition to allergen reduction, seed oil composition is another quality trait in peanut that could be targeted using the tilling approach. monounsaturated fatty acids are less prone to oxidation than polyunsaturated fatty acids, and thus contribute to better flavor and longer storage life of peanut oil  <cit> . in addition, monounsaturated fatty acids are nutritionally desirable, and are believed to contribute to cardiovascular health. linoleic acid  is a polyunsaturated fatty acid which typically makes up around 15-43% of peanut oil  <cit> . in developing seeds it is produced from the monounsaturated oleic acid  by the action of Δ <dig> fatty acid desaturase . two homeologous ahfad <dig> genes have been identified in peanut, one originating from each subgenome, designated ahfad2a and ahfad2b <cit> . reduction in the activity of ahfad <dig> increases the ratio of oleic to linoleic acid, but only one functioning allele is required to confer a normal oleate phenotype  <cit> . mutations in each of the ahfad <dig> genes were also identified using tilling.

RESULTS
determination of gene copy numbers, and gene-specific amplification
prior to tilling in a polyploid such as peanut it is necessary to determine the copy number and perform the molecular characterization of any gene of interest, because most genes exist in multiple copies. co-amplification of multiple homologous sequences would likely result in an excessive number of fragments on tilling gels, and difficulty in identification of mutations. also when a mutation is identified, it is necessary to know which gene copy has been altered. in peanut, which is an allotetraploid, genes encoding the two isoforms of ara h  <dig> are homeologous, representing orthologs from diploid ancestors  <cit> . the open reading frames of these two genes are highly similar, with the major difference being an in-frame insertion of  <dig> bp in ara h  <dig> , resulting in an insertion of  <dig> amino acids containing an extra copy of the sequence dpysps, a known allergenic ige-binding epitope  <cit> . gene-specific primer pairs yielded amplicons of  <dig>  bp for ara h  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp for ara h  <dig>  . each primer pair amplified only one band of expected size from the a- or b-subgenome, and also from the putative progenitors a. duranensis and a. ipaensis, respectively  <cit> . furthermore, the specific amplification was confirmed by sequence analysis .

for number of bp screened,  <dig> bp is subtracted to adjust for the 100-bp regions at the top and bottom of tilling gel images that are difficult to analyze.

prior to designing pcr primers for ara h  <dig>  two genomic clones of ara h  <dig> were found in genbank. the first accession  was reported by viquez et al.  <cit>  and is identical to the cdna sequence of accession l <dig> whose encoded protein is designated ara h  <dig>  by iuis  <cit>  . a second genomic clone  was reported by li et al.  <cit>  and is nearly identical to accession l <dig> whose protein is referred to by chassaigne et al.  <cit>  as isoform  <dig>  for clarity we will refer to this isoform as ara h  <dig>  even though this is not an official iuis designation. pcr amplification using primers  <dig> and  <dig>  produced two pcr products appearing as a doublet on agarose gel . amplicons from gene-specific pcr were  <dig>  bp for ara h  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp for ara h  <dig>  . analysis of ara h  <dig> pcr products from a. hypogaea and its diploid progenitors showed the presence of both genes in a. hypogaea, but only one copy in each diploid. the primer pair specific to ara h  <dig>   amplified only in a. hypogaea and a. ipaensis , while the primer pair specific to ara h  <dig>   amplified only in a. hypogaea and a. duranensis . using the known sequence information, southern blot analysis of genomic dna from a. hypogaea was carried out to confirm that no additional copies of ara h  <dig> are present in the peanut genome. genomic dna digested with hindiii, which has no cut sites within either gene, yielded two nearly overlapping fragments of approximately  <dig>  kb each when probed with a full-length ara h  <dig>  probe . dna was also digested with ecori, which has one cut site in each copy of ara h  <dig>  southern blot analysis revealed four fragments, two from each homeolog, as expected. lastly, the dna was cut with asei, which cuts ara h  <dig>  , but not ara h  <dig> . as expected, three fragments were produced . ecori-digested plasmids carrying either ara h  <dig>  or ara h  <dig>  were also loaded as controls; the probe recognized both copies of the gene .

another target for tilling, the Δ12-fatty acid desaturase gene ahfad <dig> has been characterized in studies by jung et al.  <cit> , lópez et al.  <cit> , and patel et al.  <cit> . this gene is also present in two copies, one in each subgenome of a. hypogaea. the gene sequences are highly conserved between the two, except for an insertion of  <dig> bp in ahfad2a ,  <dig> bp upstream of the start codon. gene-specific primer sequences utilizing this indel produce amplicons nearly identical in size:  <dig>  bp for ahfad2a and  <dig>  bp for ahfad2b .

peanut tilling populations and mutation frequencies
several populations were created using ethyl methanesulfonate  and one with diethylsulfate . the concentration of mutagen and time of treatment were selected from preliminary experiments that gave 30%-50% seed germination. from the des-treated m <dig> population,  <dig> plants were screened for all six genes, and no mutations were detected. two ems mutagenesis treatments were tested in this study,  <dig> % for  <dig>  h and  <dig> % for  <dig> h. a total of  <dig>  ems-treated m <dig> plants were screened, each for all six genes . twenty-seven snps were detected and confirmed. the overall mutation frequency for ems was  <dig> snp/ <dig> kb. for  <dig> % ems at  <dig>  h, the mutation rate was  <dig> snp/ <dig>  kb . the mutation frequency for  <dig> % ems for  <dig> h was slightly higher at  <dig> snp/ <dig> kb , although this difference probably is not significant. most of the nucleotide changes were g to a or c to t, as expected for ems-induced transitions. several unusual mutations were found in ahfad2a and ahfad2b, which may not be the result of the ems treatment . if that is the case, then the average mutation frequency would be  <dig> snp/ <dig> kb.

ara h  <dig> mutations
in total, nine snps were identified in ara h  <dig> , and five in ara h  <dig> . the first two amino-acid changes identified were in ara h  <dig>  in lines 20- <dig>  and 37- <dig> . line 37- <dig> actually had two nucleotide changes in this gene, but one of them was silent. these two mutations were confirmed in the m <dig> and m <dig> generations using tilling. dna from m <dig> or m <dig> individuals was analyzed both alone and mixed with wild type dna. homozygotes were identified when snps were detected in mixed samples but not in the corresponding unmixed samples. homozygous mutants allowed the testing of ige binding on the altered proteins from seed extracts. total protein extracts from homozygous m <dig> lines of 20- <dig> and 37- <dig> were normalized for loading equal amounts of ara h  <dig> , as measured by anti-ara h  <dig> chicken polyclonal antibody, and were tested for binding to serum from four patients with peanut hypersensitivity . the ige-immunoblot showed no differences between the native ara h  <dig>  present in the peanut cultivar georgia green   <cit>  and the ara h  <dig>  allelic variants detected by tilling in lines 20- <dig> and 37- <dig> . although the mutations were generated in cultivar tifrunner  <cit>  there is no difference between the ara h  <dig>  proteins of these two cultivars.

four more silent mutations were found in ara h  <dig> , one of which is identical to the silent mutation in line 37- <dig>  one other amino acid change  was also identified in ara h  <dig> . three amino acid changes were identified in ara h  <dig> , but two of them  are identical . this change occurs in the second dpysps motif, which is a known allergenic epitope  <cit> . the third amino acid change  also lies within an allergenic epitope, just before the first dpysps motif . because homozygous seed has not yet been recovered, the ability of these mutant proteins to bind ige has not yet been tested, although these look to be promising candidates for reduced allergenicity of ara h  <dig> . a g to a mutation was also found  <dig> bp upstream of the start codon of ara h  <dig> ; however, it does not appear to be located within any important promoter elements.

lastly, a g to a transition was identified in the start codon of ara h  <dig> . a downstream atg is out of frame, and so a protein knockout was expected. two m <dig> seeds were recovered, a small chip was taken from each for protein analysis, and the seeds were planted. both seeds grew into phenotypically normal plants. sds-page analysis of the seed protein extracts confirmed that one of the seeds was indeed missing the  <dig> kd band which represents the ara h  <dig>  protein  <cit> , and was thus homozygous for the mutation . the other seed appeared to have a reduced quantity of ara h  <dig> ; dna sequence analysis  confirmed that this plant was a heterozygote. western blot analysis  also confirmed the absence of ara h  <dig>  protein in the homozygous mutant. further analysis with 2-d difference gel electrophoresis  confirmed that both of the ara h  <dig>  isoforms, shown to differ by a two amino acid truncation at the carboxy terminus  <cit> , were missing in the homozygous mutant line .

ara h  <dig> mutations
in the longest amplicon, ara h  <dig>  , signals from both irdye channels sometimes were not visible on li-cor gels due to background and fragment length, but snps identified from single-channel signals were later verified by sequencing. four mutations have been confirmed in ara h  <dig>  . one of these, a c to t transition at bp position  <dig>  is silent, but the other three are predicted to induce amino acid changes: r  <dig> w, p  <dig> l, and e  <dig> k . the arginine to tryptophan change at position  <dig> lies within epitope  <dig>  <cit> . only one mutation was confirmed in ara h  <dig> ; a premature stop codon is produced at bp position  <dig> by a c to t mutation. this is expected to result in a truncated protein of  <dig> amino acids . all four of these non-silent mutations have been confirmed in the m <dig> generation by tilling. a caps  marker was developed to detect the ara h  <dig>  truncation mutant in succeeding generations. the wild-type amplicon contains six bsli sites, one of which is deleted in the mutant. this marker was used to identify a homozygous mutant in the m <dig> generation .

both ara h  <dig> proteins appear as a thick band of approximately  <dig>  kd on sds-page  <cit> . although the two genes encode proteins of slightly different sizes, we were unable to resolve both of them with one-dimensional electrophoresis. thus, 2d sds-page and 2d-dige were attempted to confirm the absence of the protein in seeds of the homozygous ara h  <dig>  truncation mutant. from the 2-d page and 2-d western blot  it was not possible to resolve only two distinct ara h  <dig> isoforms, an expected result based on published 2-d gel analyses for ara h  <dig>  <cit> . multiple post-translational protein modifications  are produced from the two isoforms of ara h  <dig>  however, there was a definite difference in the relative cy <dig>  and cy <dig>  signal intensities for the group of spots in the pi range of  <dig> - <dig>  representing ara h  <dig>  from these data it is not possible to conclude that the ara h  <dig>  isoform has been completely eliminated. however, quantitative analysis of the 2-d dige mutant and wild-type gels showed that the intensities of three pi  <dig> - <dig>  spots representing ara h  <dig>  were reduced  <dig> - <dig> -fold in the mutant, but others with a higher pi appeared to increase , although these isoforms were less abundant than the lower pi isoforms in both wild-type and mutant. also, spots  <dig> and 485/ <dig> which appear as doublets in the wild-type  appear as single spots in the mutant , suggesting that several protein products have indeed been eliminated in the mutant.



ahfad <dig> mutations
one silent mutation was found in each of ahfad2a and ahfad2b, and one predicted amino acid change  was found in ahfad2a. all three of these mutations were c to t transitions, typical for ems-induced mutations. several mutations were also identified in these genes which were not typical: an a-insertion, observed twice in ahfad2b, and three identical a to g mutations in ahfad2a . these are unusual for ems-induced mutations, but it is perhaps the location and frequency of these mutations which is most intriguing. the a-insertion in ahfad2b occurs  <dig> bp after the start codon, causing a frameshift, and likely resulting in a truncated protein due to a premature stop codon . this mutation was identified in two different m <dig> plants in our tilling populations. using a caps marker  <cit> , this mutation has been shown to be stably inherited in the m <dig> generation derived from one of our tilling mutants . in ahfad2a, three different m <dig> plants were found to contain the same mutation, an a to g transition at  <dig> bp after the start codon. this is predicted to change the amino acid at position  <dig> from asparagine to aspartic acid .

discussion
in tilling populations of diploids such as sorghum  moench)  <cit>  and lotus japonicus <cit> , phenotypic mutants were frequently observed. in contrast, very few phenotypic mutations were observed in field or greenhouse-grown m <dig> peanut plants in this study, most likely due to genetic buffering caused by polyploidy, similar to that observed in tilling populations of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat   <cit> . in ems-mutagenized hexaploid wheat, a mutation frequency of  <dig> snp/ <dig> kb has been reported, and  <dig> snp/ <dig> kb was reported in tetraploid wheat  <cit> . the mutation rate observed in this study on peanut is much lower than that reported for wheat and lower than arabidopsis , or most legumes including soybean , and pea . it is similar to or higher than that in some populations of barley  and rice . as with barley and rice, mutation density potentially could be improved by using alternate genotypes, treatment conditions, or choice of mutagens  <cit> . no mutations were detected in the des-mutagenized population, even though this chemical was used to recover a high oleic acid mutant of peanut  <cit> . in the present study, an incubation time of  <dig>  h at a concentration of  <dig> % was substantially different from that used by moore  <cit>  . with the longer incubation time of  <dig>  h, no germination occurred at a concentration greater than  <dig> %.

the ige-immunoblot showed no differences between the wild-type ara h  <dig>  and the ara h  <dig>  allelic variants detected by tilling in lines 20- <dig> and 37- <dig> , despite the fact that both of these changes affect known ige epitopes  <cit> . although a reduction in ige binding was not detected with these two allelic variants, it has been shown that a small change in this protein can indeed have this desired effect. in a recent study ramos et al.  <cit>  identified a naturally occurring variant  in an accession of a. duranensis that showed 56-99% reduction in ige binding compared to wild-type ara h  <dig> . the arginine to tryptophan change at position  <dig> in ara h  <dig>  lies within epitope  <dig>  <cit> . although it is unlikely that this residue is critical for ige binding  <cit> , and the other two amino acid changes do not reside within known epitopes, the possibility of reduced ige affinity cannot be completely ruled out until these proteins are tested.

the ara h  <dig>  and ara h  <dig>  genes code for proteins with predicted sizes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kd, respectively, but the mature proteins extracted from seeds appear as a single  <dig>  kd band on sds-page  <cit> . the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified proteins does not match the predicted n-terminal sequence; rather it is located  <dig> or  <dig> amino acids downstream, depending on the isoform  <cit> . these first  <dig> or  <dig> amino acids, along with an included  <dig> amino acid signal peptide, are cleaved off during post-translational processing. the  <dig> or  <dig> amino acid cleaved peptides contain six of the seven cysteines found in ara h  <dig> isoforms  <cit>  and three of the allergenic epitopes  <cit> , and are hypothesized to form disulfide bridges conferring a stable conformation similar to plant antifungal peptides  <cit> . in our ara h  <dig>  truncation mutant, the truncation occurs downstream of the cleavage site potentially leaving the cleaved peptide intact. it remains to be seen whether the cleavage product is still produced and stable in seeds of the mutant.

a previously described mutant allele of ahfad2b contains an a-insertion  <dig> bp after the start codon, causing a frameshift, and likely results in a truncated protein due to a premature stop codon  <cit> . this mutant allele has been reported previously in multiple independently derived cultivars which have a high oleic to linoleic acid ratio , most likely due to the inactivity of ahfad2b  <cit> . the same mutation was identified in two different m <dig> plants in our tilling populations. it is possible that this mutant allele is present at a low frequency in the source seed for the tilling population, although these seed were produced before extensive breeding for the high o/l trait was initiated in the usda-ars program. furthermore, independent generation of this mutant allele has been reported in china and the u.s.  <cit> . even more surprising, three different m <dig> plants were found to contain a reversion to the wild-type allele of ahfad2a, an a to g transition at  <dig> bp after the start codon, whereas the tilling population parent, 'tifrunner', possesses the mutant allele. this reversion is predicted to change the amino acid at position  <dig> from asparagine to aspartic acid and restore functionality to the desaturase enzyme. in most runner-type peanut cultivars, the ahfad2a protein is presumed to be inactive due to the presence of the asparagine residue at position  <dig>  <cit> . the aspartic acid residue is likely an important component of the active site of the enzyme and is highly conserved among fatty acid desaturases from other plants, including a. duranensis, from which ahfad2a likely is derived  <cit> . based on a survey of the mini-core of the u.s. peanut germplasm collection, chu et al.  <cit>  found that the aspartic acid residue also appears to be conserved among spanish and valencia market types of peanut, but the inactive allele was found to be common  among virginia and runner market-types. in our three independent tilling mutants, the asparagine has been mutated back to aspartic acid, most likely restoring the function of ahfad2a. in a recombinant ahfad2a protein with the aspartic acid restored at position  <dig> by site-directed mutagenesis, bruner et al.  <cit>  showed that its full function is indeed restored. both the frequency and the nature of these two mutations are atypical of mutations induced by ems, including the other mutations observed in this study. it is unclear whether these mutations are due to the ems treatment, outcrossing, or genetic impurity in the starting seed, but the latter appears to be the most likely explanation. if that is the case, then assessment of genetic purity at specific loci may be another use for mismatch-based mutation detection.

CONCLUSIONS
these experiments represent the initial steps toward the development of a hypoallergenic peanut. because genetic variation for allergens is limited in cultivated peanut, mutagenesis is necessary to generate variation. we have shown that tilling is a useful technique for screening mutagenized populations of peanut for induced changes in allergen genes. when multiple seed storage proteins with reduced ige binding are identified, or more knockout mutations are found, the next step will be a concerted breeding effort to combine these mutant alleles into one plant. tilling, caps markers, or a more efficient snp assay can be used as tools to track the inheritance of these alleles in the breeding process. tilling in peanut can be extended to virtually any gene, and could be used to assist in the modification of other traits such as disease resistance, stress tolerance, early maturity, or as shown in this study, nutritional properties of the seed.
