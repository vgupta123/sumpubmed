BACKGROUND
human pathogenic leishmanias are family of protozoa that are transmitted by female sandflies to mammalian hosts such as dogs, rodents, or humans. three clinical forms of human leishmaniases are distinguished: visceral , mucocutaneous , and cutaneous leishmaniasis . all three exhibit different immunopathologies and different degrees of morbidity and mortality. visceral leishmaniasis  leads to progressive hepatosplenomegaly and is fatal if untreated. the classical mucocutaneous leishmaniasis  leads to progressive destruction of nasal and buccal mucosa, eventually destroying nose, lips, palate and pharynx. cutaneous leishmaniasis , is a localized, frequently self-healing infection of the skin at the site of the initial insect-bite, leaving ugly scars and life-long immunity  <cit> . the human leishmaniases are occurring worldwide, with endemic regions spreading and case numbers strongly increasing over the last ten years. about  <dig> million people are infected, with about  <dig> million new cases occcurring annually. chemotherapy of the leishmaniases is in a very unsatisfactory state, and research into new drug targets and the development of novel, more effective and less toxic drugs is an urgent priority  <cit> .

the leishmania parasite undergoes a complex life cycle containing two different hosts, the fly vectors  and the human or mammalian hosts. metacyclic parasites injected by the fly into the bite wound rapidly invade macrophages and differentiate morphologically and metabolically into intracellular amastigote forms. when taken up by a fly, the parasites transform in the gut of the fly into flagellated promastigote forms that eventually migrate to the salivary gland of the fly, where they differentiate again into infectious metacyclics  <cit> . during all these differentiation steps, the parasites are in continuous, intense contact with structures and metabolites of their hosts, requiring a repertoire of sensing and adaptation mechanisms in order to coordinate differentiation with host environment. surprisingly little is known on the signalling processes involved in controlling and coordinating all these processes, and even less is known on the role of camp in this context  <cit> . nevertheless, several independent observations indicate that camp is involved in the regulation of differentiation  <cit> , but the mode of action of camp in these processes remains to be explored. with respect to the generation of the camp signal, adenylyl cyclases from l. donovani have been characterized  <cit> . on the other hand, pde activity against camp has been demonstrated in l. mexicana and l. donovani  <cit> , and a pde with an unusually high km for camp has been purified  <cit>  from l. mexicana.

pdes are ubiquitous enzymes, and they are essential for cyclic nucleotide signalling since they represent, at least for eukaryotic cells, essentially the only way for a cell to terminate a cyclic nucleotide signal. in addition, the pdes are largely responsible for confining a cyclic nucleotide signal to particular locations, and to prevent its diffusion throughout the cell  <cit> . three classes of pdes have been identified based on their different catalytic domains. class i  <cit>  is found in almost all eukaryotes, and it represents the only pde class of higher eukaryotes. class i pdes have also been identified in the kinetoplastid protozoa trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of african human sleeping sickness  <cit>  and trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the south american chagas disease  <cit> . class ii pdes  <cit>  are found in some prokaryotes  and in many lower eukaryotes such as dictyostelium discoideum or fungi such as saccharomyces, candida or neurospora. dictyostelium and fungi contain genes for both, class i and class ii pdes. a special case is represented by schizosaccharomyces pombe that contains only a single, class ii pde gene. the completely unrelated class iii pdes  <cit>  are confined to the prokaryotes.

the human genome codes for eleven pde families, most of which contain several family members. in addition to this genetic variety, numerous splice variants are generated from many of the genes, resulting in a pde proteome of about sixty pde isoenzymes. the catalytic domains of all pde family members share considerable homology in their amino acid sequences, and their three-dimensional structures appear to be closely similar. despite the overall similarity of their catalytic domains, the individual pdes exhibit characteristic selectivities for camp and/or cgmp  <cit>  as their substrates, and each displays a unique inhibitor specificity profile.

besides their interest for basic cell biology, the human class i pdes have become interesting targets for drug development. sub-type and tissue-specific pde inhibitors constitute a growing class of pharmaceutical compounds that find applications for a broad spectrum of maladies  <cit> .

the recent completion of a number of kinetoplastid genomes has allowed to gain an overview over the pde repertoire in these organisms. we here present the identification of the five class i pdes from leishmania, and report an initial characterization for three of them.

RESULTS
identification of five putative cyclic nucleotide specific pdes of l. major
screening the leishmania major genome database  <cit>  with amino acid sequences of class i pde catalytic domains identified five genes that are predicted to code for class i pdes . chromosome  <dig> contains the single copy gene lmjpdea  that is predicted to code for a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids. its catalytic domain comprises amino acids  <dig> –  <dig> , with no other functional domains discernible. the open reading frame of lmjpdea was amplified from genomic dna and sequenced and its sequence was submitted to genbank under the accession number ay <dig> 

chromosome  <dig> contains a locus containing two tandemly arranged pde genes, lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig> . the open reading frames of both genes were amplified from genomic dna and were sequenced and the sequences have been submitted to genbank under the following accession numbers: lmjpdeb1: ay <dig>  and lmjpdeb2: ay <dig> 

the sequencing data, in conjunction with southern blot and pcr analyses demonstrated that the current version of the l. major database  contains an assembly error in this region, in that it represents only a single pde gene that is a chimera between lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig>  the genomic organization of the lmjpdeb locus now presented in fig 1b closely corresponds to that found for the homologous pde genes in the t. brucei and the t. cruzi genomes. in t. brucei, tbrpdeb <dig>  and tbrpdeb <dig>  are also tandemly arranged on chromosome  <dig>  with  <dig> bp between the two open reading frames, followed by a gene for the small non-histone protein nhp2/rs <dig> . in t. cruzi, the two homologues are similarly arranged on chromosome  <dig>  in the sequence tcrpdeb <dig>  followed by tcrpdeb <dig>  and by nhp2/rs <dig> 

lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig> produce stable transcripts
expression of the two genes in l. major promastigotes was analyzed by northern blot analysis and by rt-pcr. when northern blots of total rna were hybridized with the respective probes, stable mrna was detected for both of them . similar results were also obtained using total rna of l. mexicana promastigotes and amastigotes , suggesting that the two genes are similarly expressed in both life cycle stages. the 5'-termini of the respective mrnas in l. major promastigotes were analyzed by rt-pcr amplification using a common, mini-exon specific forward primer and individual gene-specific reverse primers for each gene. for lmjpdeb <dig>  a single type of mrna was found, with an unusually long 5'-utr region of  <dig> nucleotides. for lmjpdb <dig>  two splice variants were identified, with 5'-utr regions of  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides, respectively .

amino acid sequence analysis of lmjpdea, lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb2
the polypeptide chain of lmjpdea consists of  <dig> amino acids without any recognizable functional domain, except for the class i pde catalytic domain at the c-terminus .

the open reading frames of lmjpdeb <dig>  and lmjpdeb <dig>  code for proteins of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. the two share an overall  <dig> % sequence identity, with a markedly uneven distribution along the polypeptides. the first  <dig> amino acids are highly diverged , whereas the remainder of the sequence is almost completely conserved . the only exception is a stretch of  <dig> amino acids in the catalytic domain that are entirely dissimilar between lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig> . interestingly, similar stretches of divergence within the catalytic domains are also found, at identical positions, in the respective homologues of t. brucei and t. cruzi. lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig> both contain two closely spaced gaf domains  <cit>  in their n-terminal regions . between the two gaf domains, a putative protein kinase a phosphorylation site is located . this is the only protein kinase a site that is also conserved, and found at an identical position, in the t. brucei and t. cruzi homologues.

the catalytic domains of the leishmanial pdes are highly conserved, and they all contain the signature sequence  that characterizes them as class i pdes  <cit> . the amino acid sequence identity between the catalytic domains of lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig> and the corresponding regions of the human pdes  <dig> –  <dig> varies between  <dig> %  to  <dig> % . based on the publicly available 3d-structures of several human pde catalytic domains  <cit> , sixteen amino acid residues are absolutely conserved between all human pdes . in only two of these positions, some of the leishmanial pdes exhibit amino acid replacements, both in positions that are not directly located in the active site. a conserved alanine residue  is replaced by g <dig>  g <dig> and y <dig> in lmjpdeb <dig>  lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdec, respectively. in addition, a conserved histidine residue  is replaced by leucine  or methionine . of the two residues that confer selectivity for camp over cgmp, q <dig> and n <dig> in hspde4b  <cit> , the glutamine residue is conserved in all leishmanial pdes. in the position corresponding to n <dig>  an asparagine residue is maintained in all leishmanial pdes except for lmjpdec. here the corresponding position is taken by an alanine residue . this suggests that lmjpdec might represent a dual-substrate pde, as has already been experimentally demonstrated for its t. cruzi homologue, tcrpdec  <cit> . while the catalytic domains of all five l. major pdes share a high degree of similarity, the two catalytic domains of lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig> are completely identical, with the exception of a stretch of  <dig> amino acids that comprises the predicted helices  <dig> and  <dig>  similar non-conserved stretches of comparable length and at identical locations are also observed in the homologues of t. brucei and t. cruzi .

functional complementation of a pde-deficient s. cerevisiae strain by lmjpdea, lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb2
deletion of the two pde genes scpde <dig> and scpde <dig> from the s. cerevisiae genome renders the mutants highly sensitive to stress conditions such as a heat-shock. heterologous complementation of this heat-shock phenotype has proven to be a highly sensitive validation procedure for suspected pde genes  <cit> . the full-size open reading frames of lmjpdea, lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig> were cloned into the yeast expression vector plt <dig>  <cit>  and expressed in the pde-deficient s. cerevisiae strain pp <dig>  <cit> . transformants were patched and tested for heat shock resistance . all three pde genes restored heat shock resistance to the indicator strain, though with different efficiencies. lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig> completely restored the wild-type phenotype, whereas complementation by lmjpdea was much weaker, as seen at short incubation times after the heat shock. patches expressing lmjpdea had only grown weakly when observed after  <dig> h post-heat-shock incubation at 30°c , while patches expressing lmjpdeb <dig> or lmjpdeb <dig> already showed vigorous growth after this time. when observed after  <dig> h of incubation, all three recombinant strains had grown to a similar extent . the results of these complementation experiments established that all three genes code for functional pdes, and they demonstrate that these pdes can use camp as their substrate.

catalytic activity
soluble cell lysates were prepared from yeast strains expressing each of the three pdes and were assayed for pde activity. lysates prepared from the lmjpdea expressing strain consistently showed no measurable pde activity. while the reason for this is still unclear and might reflect a trivial technical problem, the observation is in line with the finding that lmjpdea complements the pde-deficient yeast strain pp <dig> much less efficiently than do the two other pde genes . in contrast to lmjpdea, lysates from yeast strains expressing lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig> showed strong pde activities. the two enzymes exhibit km values of  <dig> and  <dig> μm for camp, respectively, well within the range of other class i pdes . the apparent km for camp  was not altered by the presence of a 100-fold excess of cgmp , nor was vmax , indicating that lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig> are specific for camp, and that their activity is not modulated by cgmp. a 50-fold excess of the reaction product 5'-amp also did not alter the km , indicating that the pdes are not subject to marked product inhibition. for all parameters determined, lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig> behaved very similarly, indicating that the small stretch of sequence divergence between the two catalytic domains does not markedly alter their functionality. also, the divergent n-terminal regions do not seem to affect the kinetics under in vitro conditions.

inhibitor profiling
as an initial survey, a number of commercially available inhibitors that are frequently used in cell biological studies were tested at a 100-fold excess over substrate , using extracts from yeast cells expressing the recombinant pdes. most of the inhibitors tested , 8-methoxymethyl-ibmx, trequinsin, papaverine, milrinone, pentoxifylline, and erythro-9-adenine  were essentially inactive, even at the high concentration used in these experiments. only dipyridamole , trequinsin  and etazolate caused significant inhibition.

inhibition of cell proliferation
dipyridamole, etazolate and trequinsin were further tested for their effect on cell proliferation . promastigote cultures of l. major or amastigote cultures of l. infantum were grown in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitors, or in the presence of  <dig> %  dimethylsulfoxide as a control. all three compounds were strongly inhibitory . all three inhibitors are markedly more potent than the frequently used, wide-spectrum pde-inhibitor isobutyl-methyl-xanthine . the inhibitory effects were independent of cell density and were not reduced upon prolonged incubation of the culturesthese observations indicate that the inhibitors are metabolically stable, and that the pdes may be of similar importance for proliferation of both promastigotes and amastigotes in culture.

discussion
the current study reports on the identification and characterization of three class i cyclic nucleotide-specific pdes from l. major. lmjpdea is a single copy gene, while the two genes for lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig> are tandemly arranged on chromosome  <dig> and code for two similar enzymes. very similar enzymes also have been identified in t. brucei and other kinetoplastids, and a unifying nomenclature for kinetoplastid pdes has recently been proposed  <cit> . the catalytic domains of the leishmanial pdes are very similar to those of the human pdes, and all functionally important amino acids are conserved.

lmjpdea, lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig> complement the pde-defective s. cerevisiae strain pp <dig> and restore its wild-type heat-shock resistance phenotype. however, complementation by lmjpdea was less effective  than that by the other two . when yeast cell lysates were prepared from lmjpdea-complemented strains, no pde activity was detectable. this is similar to what was observed earlier with the highly conserved t. brucei homologue of lmjpdea. this gene, tbrpdea, also complements the pp <dig> strain, but only very little enzyme activity was detectable in yeast cell lysates  <cit> . this lack of biochemically detectable activity despite functional complementation may reflect some specific property common to the lmjpdea and tbrpdea enzymes.

lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig> contain catalytic domains that are identical, except for a  <dig> amino acid sequence that is highly diverged between the two. this sequence spans the region of predicted helices  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . divergent regions of similar length are also found at the corresponding locations of the homologous pdes of t. brucei and t. cruzi . these regions might confer subtle functional or regulatory specificities to the otherwise highly conserved catalytic domains of the respective isoenzymes of each species.

for lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig> highly conserved, homologues genes exist also in other kinetoplastid protozoa, t. brucei and t. cruzi. in both organisms, the two homologues tbrpdeb <dig>  and tbrpdeb <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> of t. brucei, and tcrpdeb <dig> and tcrpdeb <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> of t. cruzi are tandemly arranged with the two open reading frames spaced by about  <dig> bp, and followed by an open reading frame of an nhp2/rs <dig> gene coding for a non-histone protein. our results suggest that lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig> are similarly arranged on chromosome  <dig> of l. major.

lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig> both complement the pde-deficient yeast strain pp <dig> very effectively, and high enzyme activities were present in the respective yeast cell lysates. both enzymes behave very similarly, exhibiting kms in the low μm range for camp as a substrate, and they are entirely specific for camp. when a number of pde inhibitors were tested on recombinant lmjpdeb <dig> and lmjpdeb <dig>  most of them exhibited very low potency. this marked insensitivity of leishmanial pdes to many pde inhibitors, including the broad-spectrum inhibitor ibmx, corresponds to what was found with the t. brucei homologues. only dipyridamole, trequinsin and etazolate exhibited at least a moderate potency.

the three inhibitors also inhibited proliferation of l. major promastigotes in culture, all with ic <dig> values in the  <dig> –  <dig> μm range. very similar ec <dig> values are also obtained when the same compounds were used with l. infantum amastigotes, indicating that both life cycle stages are similarly sensitive to these inhibitors. though inhibitor specificity cannot be taken for granted at these relatively high concentrations, the experiments clearly suggest that the pdes may be essential enzymes whose inhibition blocks cell proliferation.

CONCLUSIONS
the identification and molecular characterization of the leishmanial pdes will now allow a more detailed investigation of the role of camp signalling in leishmania biology. on the other hand, these pdes may represent novel drug targets. they belong to a family of enzymes that has already been successfully exploited by medicinal chemistry for a number of human disease conditions. the range of applications for pde inhibitors might yet be extended further to include antiprotozoal drugs.
