BACKGROUND
pharyngeal and esophageal cancers are some of the most malignant gastrointestinal tumors  <cit> . we previously reported that a cell adhesion molecule, periplakin , is significantly downregulated in human esophageal cancers. immunohistochemical staining has also revealed that ppl changes its cellular localization as well as its expression levels with cancer progression  <cit> . in addition, ppl expression has been associated with nodal metastasis  <cit> . these findings indicate that ppl plays an important role in the development of esophageal and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma; however, the precise mechanism remains largely unknown.

ppl is a member of the plakin family comprising desmoplakin, envoplakin, plectin, and bullous pemphigoid antigen  <dig>  which have various functions in connecting cytoskeleton elements to form intercellular junction complexes  <cit> . plakin families also function as "molecular bridges" of cells that link the intracellular cytoskeleton and cell-cell junctions. for example, plectin, one of the most well-studied plakins, directly interacts with signal transductions  <cit> . ppl also plays a role as a localization signal in oncogenic serine/threonine protein kinase akt/protein kinase b -mediated signaling in human cancer cell lines  <cit> . here, akt/pkb is a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase  and functions as a critical regulator of cell survival and proliferation. furthermore, activation of the pi3k/akt/pkb pathway is emerging as a central feature of epithelial-mesenchymal transition , which is believed to be a crucial event in tumor development  <cit> .

in this study, we examined changes in cell growth, morphology, migration, and attachment activity following sirna against ppl to investigate the involvement of ppl in tumor development. we found that ppl knockdown was related to a reduction in cellular movement and attachment activity, and was accompanied by pi3k/akt axis suppression in pharyngeal cancer cells; it was potentially related to emt promotion.

RESULTS
knockdown of ppl expression reduced the number of cells attached to the culture dish
since ppl expression is decreased in esophageal carcinoma tissues  <cit> , we tried to determine the effects of ppl downregulation on cancer cell activities. first, endogenous ppl expression in hypopharyngeal squamous carcinoma  and esophageal squamous carcinoma  cells was examined . d <dig> cells were selected because sirna against ppl was most efficient among these cell lines . in d <dig> cells, ppl sirna inhibited cell growth and reduced the number of cells attached to the culture dish .

knockdown of ppl expression increased the proportion of g2/m phase cells attached to the culture dish
so why was the number of attached cells to the culture dish reduced after ppl downregulation? to determine the mechanism behind this phenomenon, we first analyzed the cell cycle populations after ppl sirnas were transfected into d <dig> cells. compared to control  sirna, cultures treated with ppl sirna had a decreased g <dig>  and an increased late s and g2/m cell population . to verify this result, we further developed a double channel, brdu and 7-amino-actinomycin d , flow cytometry protocol. by plotting brdu incorporation  on the y-axis and 7-aad  on the x-axis, the cells could be divided into  <dig> populations: g <dig>  s, and g2/m . thus, knockdown of ppl reduced the s population and increased the g2/m population . in particular, the g2/m population increased  <dig> % in the control cell culture and  <dig> % in the ppl sirna cell culture, a  <dig> % increase . these data suggest that ppl sirna decreased cellular proliferation of d <dig> cells, at least partly by delay in the g2/m phase of cells attached to the culture dish. however, to determine the effect of ppl knockdown on cell growth more precisely, cells detached from the culture dish will need to be examined along with cells attached to the culture dish.

knockdown of ppl reduced cell adhesion activity
although sirna against ppl increased the g2/m phase population, the decrease in the number of cells grown on the culture dish was more remarkable . nonetheless, ppl sirna did not increase apoptosis when this was assessed by an apopercentage assay™ . how then should we explain the reduction in the number of attached cells? possible explanations include cell growth suppression, cell cycle retardation, or detachment from the culture dish. therefore, we next examined the effects of ppl downregulation on adhesion to the extracellular matrix  by an adhesion assay. cells transfected with ppl sirna decreased their attachment to ecm compared with controls . in order to confirm this result, we performed an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  assay in which edta was used to gently block adhesion of d <dig> cells to ecm during a 1-h incubation at 37°c. interestingly, ppl sirna-treated and control cells lost cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion and changed from elongated to spherical shape . however,  <dig> h after the release of edta, control cells recovered their ability to adhere to ecm and began to reproliferate . in contrast, ppl sirna-treated cells remained spherical and did not proliferate, suggesting that ppl sirna significantly attenuated cellular adhesion to ecm . these data suggest that knockdown of ppl decreases cellular adhesion to ecm in d <dig> cells.

knockdown of ppl reduces cell migration activity
cell migration is essential for the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. thus, to evaluate the effects of ppl downregulation, a wound-healing assay was also performed using d <dig> cells. ppl sirna-treated cells showed a remarkable delay in wound closure compared with control cells . this delay in wound closure could be caused by disturbance of cellular proliferation or migration. to discriminate between these possibilities, we used time-lapse and video microscopy after transfection of ppl sirna to compare and record cellular movement and migration . as expected, ppl sirna-treated cells showed a significant decrease in motility and a shorter tracking migration-length than controls . moreover, we injected yes <dig> cells  and d <dig> cells  beneath the right thigh of nude mice and monitored subsequent tumor growth. no tumor growth was observed in yes <dig> mice, while some tumors were observed in d <dig> mice . these results indicate that yes <dig> could not migrate into mice tissues owing to its slow proliferation or weak adhesiveness to ecm.

knockdown of ppl decreases cellular migration via the pi3k/akt axis
finally, we examined changes in the expression of phospholipid signaling proteins that regulate cell migration because ppl has been reported to play a role as a scaffold in akt/pkb signaling in human cancer cell lines  <cit> . the mitogen-activating protein kinase  pathway was also examined because pi3k/akt/pkb and the pathway are activated by g protein-coupled receptors  that induce signaling events  <cit> , and ppl can also interact with a wide range of gpcrs and modulate their functions  <cit> . as expected, protein expression of paktser <dig> was drastically downregulated by ppl sirna . ppl also regulates keratin organization and epithelial migration, participating in the accumulation of keratin filaments to form thick cables  <cit> . in our study, ppl sirna reduced not only the migration of assembled cells but also that of single d <dig> cells with paktser <dig> suppression. these data indicate that knockdown of ppl significantly decreases cellular migration in d <dig> cells, at least partly via the pi3k/akt axis. recent reports have indicated that the pi3k/akt axis is a central feature of emt and that akt-induced emt involves downregulation of e-cadherin  <cit> . as stated above, our results also showed that sirna against ppl suppressed paktser <dig> and reduced cellular attachment activity.

ppl expression was different among normal, atypical epithelium and cancer of the pharyngeal mucosa
if ppl expression relates to cellular migration, movement or invasion, ppl expression should be different among normal, atypical epithelium and cancers. under this hypothesis, we immunohistochemically examined ppl expression in excised human normal, atypical epithelium and in cancer of the pharyngeal mucosa . interestingly, ppl was expressed in the upper layer of the squamous epithelium in normal hypopharyngeal mucosa , whereas ppl expression was rare in atypical hypopharyngeal epithelium . note that in both the non-keratinized  and keratinized cancer areas , ppl expression was scarce. further experiments are needed to determine how ppl relates to emt, including investigations of whether ppl knockdown affects the expression of mesenchymal markers, such as e-cahderin, fibronectin and/or n-cadherin.

discussion
in this study, we revealed that sirna against ppl significantly reduced the cellular motility and adhesion activity. in addition, ppl downregulation significantly decreased cellular migration, possibly because of pi3k/akt axis interference supported by a reduction in phosphorylated akt at ser <dig> . collectively, ppl suppression reduced cell motility, and ecm invasion, all of which generate tumor progression by increasing infiltrating activity in pharyngeal squamous cancer cells.

if ppl knockdown reduces cell adhesion activity, ppl may be associated with proliferation and/or cell death because homeostasis in epithelial cells is enforced by their structural characteristics  <cit> . furthermore, distortion of these balances by ppl sirna, which interferes with cell adhesion to ecm, is often associated with epithelial tumorigenesis  <cit> . at this point, attachment to ecm is essential to support cellular functions, including differentiation, apoptosis, proliferation, and migration.

in cancers, the hallmarks of emt are the acquisition of a migratory and invasive phenotype and/or anoikis resistance, that is, accommodations for survival even in the absence of adhesion to ecm  <cit> . in fibroblast cells, akt signaling enhances activation of various small guanosine triphosphatases , resulting in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and enhanced cell motility  <cit> . in this context, the dephosphorylation of akt and paktser <dig> induced by ppl sirna  is enlightening. ly <dig>  a pi3k inhibitor, suppressed cellular migration activity in d <dig> cell . since pi3k/akt/mtor pathway inhibition is reported to decrease invasion and migration of ovarian carcinoma cell lines  <cit> , thus ppl sirna potentially decreased cellular attachment, migration or movement at least partly via the pi3k/akt axis.

moreover, the effects of the matrix are primarily mediated by integrins, a family of cell surface receptors that attach cells to ecm and mediate mechanical and chemical signals from ecm  <cit> . the pi3k/akt axis is positively regulated by integrins. although further studies are necessary, the relationship among ppl, integrins, and the integrin-plectin-vimentin complex potentially bridges ecm and intracellular cytoskeletons  <cit> . to investigate the integrins involved in this impaired adhesiveness, a cell adhesion assay using other substrates such as poly-d/l-lysin, fibronectin, or type-i collagen may be informative. for instance, apoptosis is induced when cells are detached from the surrounding ecm  in normal cells  <cit> . however, cancer or metastatic tumor cells can escape anoikis and thus invade organs   <cit> . our results indicate that ppl downregulation is accompanied by pi3k/akt axis interference which indicates emt in pharyngeal cancers. in summary, the function of ppl relates to cellular proliferation, cell cycle regulation, cellular movement, and attachment to ecm at least partly via pi3k/akt axis.

thus, knockdown of ppl reduced ecm attachment and cellular proliferation. further studies are required to investigate the role of ppl as a candidate biomarker for diagnosis and treatment of pharyngeal cancers.

CONCLUSIONS
the down-regulation of ppl significantly reduced cellular motility and adhesion activity along with phosphorylated aktser <dig> suppression. thus, ppl was positively involved in cellular movement and attachment activity, which was, at least partly achieved via the pi3k/akt axis. ppl knockdown is therefore related to reduced cellular movement and attachment activity rather than malignant progression, that is, ppl potentially participates in emt in pharyngeal cancer cells.
