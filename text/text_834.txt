BACKGROUND
messenger rna 3'-end formation is a vital step in gene expression. in this rna processing event, a precursor mrna is recognized, cleaved, and then polyadenylated at the free 3'-oh generated by the processing reaction . this processing is directed by distinct polyadenylation signal sequences present in the substrate rnas. these signals are recognized by an apparatus with conservation of components amongst eukaryotes. this apparatus consists of a complex of factors that control the action of poly polymerases, limiting polyadenylation to rnas containing polyadenylation signals. in mammals, these factors have been termed  as cpsf , cstf , cfi and cfii , and pap  polymerase) <cit> . in addition, a poly binding protein  is involved in controlling the processivity of pap as well as the final poly length  <cit> . in yeast, 3'-end formation is mediated by a complex that also consists of several factors, each of which in turn consists of several polypeptide subunits. these include cpf  and cf <dig> and  <dig> . while biochemical fractionation and purification has led to the designation of somewhat different complexes in various systems, for the most part, the polypeptide subunits that constitute the polyadenylation machinery in mammals and yeast  are strikingly conserved  <cit> .

messenger rna 3'-end formation is coordinated with other steps in the course of gene expression. several polyadenylation factor subunits interact with components of the transcription initiation machinery  <cit> , and "load" onto the transcribed gene at or near the transcription initiation site  <cit> . the nuclear mrna cap-binding complex has been reported to be involved in 3'-end processing in hela cell extracts  <cit> . there is an interplay between splicing and polyadenylation that is important for determining  the 3'-terminal exon in mammalian genes  <cit> . polyadenylation is closely linked with transcription termination  <cit> . polyadenylation factor subunits also play roles in the maturation of cell-cycle-regulated histone mrnas, snrnas, and trnas  <cit> . polyadenylation is associated with transport of mrna from the nucleus to the cytoplasm  <cit> . finally, associations with dna repair and chromosome segregation have been reported  <cit> . these various observations reveal both an extensive interconnection between the polyadenylation apparatus and other processes, and a considerable potential for rearrangement and "donation" of parts of the polyadenylation complex to other processes.

the process of 3' end formation in plants is less well understood. plant genes possess polyadenylation signals that are somewhat different from their mammalian and yeast counterparts  <cit> . in plants, three different classes of cis-elements are involved in mrna 3' end formation. one of these  is situated between  <dig> and  <dig> nts upstream from its associated poly site. the nue is an a-rich element that may be between  <dig> and  <dig> nts in length. another class of cis element  is located farther upstream  from the poly sites. this element resides in a similar position to efficiency elements that modulate 3' end formation in mammals and yeast  <cit> , and bears a base composition reminiscent of downstream sequences involved in 3' end formation in mammals. the third class of cis-element is the poly site itself and its adjacent u-rich element, the combination of these signals is now called ce or cleavage element  <cit> .

efforts have been made in recent years to characterize the protein factors that recognize above polyadenylation signals and forming polyadenylation complex in plants. these include the characterization of the genes and initial functional determination of the arabidopsis homologues of pap, cpsf and cstf subunits, and fip <dig>  mutational analysis of two cpsf homologues, atcpsf73-ii and atcpsf <dig>  has shown that atcpsf73-ii is, apart from house-keeping functions, an essential gene that affects female gametophyte genetic transmission  <cit> , and that atcpsf <dig> is non-essential  <cit> . atcpsf <dig> has been demonstrated to possess rna-binding and endonuclease activity  <cit> . an arabidopsis ortholog of fip has been shown to bind rna and interact in vitro with a number of other arabidopsis polyadenylation factor subunits  <cit> . two arabidopsis cstf subunit orthologs, atcstf <dig> and atcstf <dig>  interact in vitro; moreover, atcstf <dig> binds rna  <cit> . mutations in two polyadenylation-related genes  affect the process of posttranscriptional gene silencing  <cit> , and mutations in another  result in alterations in the timing of flowering  <cit> .

these studies have enhanced our understanding of the plant polyadenylation factors. however, many questions remain regarding the functions of these proteins. for example, it is not clear if they exist in complexes more analogous to mammalian or yeast polyadenylation factors. sequence-specific interactions between any of the plant proteins and polyadenylation signals have yet to be demonstrated, and interactions between the various proteins themselves have not been studied to any great extent. in addition, the integration of mrna 3' end formation into other aspects of nuclear rna metabolism in plants has not been studied. all of these matters are of considerable importance for the understanding of gene expression in plants.

in this paper, as an initial effort to elucidate the mechanism of mrna polyadenylation and its role in the regulation of gene expression, we present a genome level annotation of arabidopsis polyadenylation factors, a summary of the expression profiles of these genes, and a systematic analysis of pair-wise protein-protein interaction assays involving the arabidopsis polyadenylation factor subunits.

RESULTS
in silico analysis of the expression of arabidopsis polyadenylation-related genes
the arabidopsis genome possesses genes that encode most of the polyadenylation factor subunits that have been described in other eukaryotes . possible exceptions to this include the absence of orthologs to cfim59/ <dig> and hrp <dig>  however, this is probably due to an inability to identify, using blast, authentic orthologs in the large array of sr+rrm- or rrm-containing proteins encoded by the arabidopsis genome. many of these genes and their protein products have been studied previously. moreover, with a few exceptions , the expression of these genes can be seen in microarray studies. for the majority of these proteins, the sequence similarity with other eukaryotic counterparts  is extensive, suggestive of a conservation of function that has been preserved in the different eukaryotic lineages. however, a subset of the plant factors shares a more limited similarity with their eukaryotic counterparts. these proteins include atcpsf <dig>  atcstf <dig>  and the fips and pcfs . with these proteins, functional motifs are conserved, but other parts show sizable sequence divergence.

although polyadenylation is expected to be essential for growth and development, the nature of some mutants impaired in arabidopsis polyadenylation factor subunits  <cit>  raises the possibility that some plant polyadenylation-related genes are active at specific times during development, or in response to particular environmental cues. to explore this hypothesis, the expression of the set of arabidopsis genes listed in table  <dig> was studied using public domain microarray data. for this study, the data available from nasc  was used; normalized expression values for most of the genes listed in table  <dig> was extracted from the datasets listed in additional file 1: microarray keys and data, and plotted so as to permit easy comparison. one of the arabidopsis polyadenylation-related genes listed in table  <dig>  is not represented in the affytmetrix ath probe set and was thus not included in this study. the complete results of this study are presented in additional file  <dig>  the most interesting and salient aspects of this study are discussed in more detail in the following.

as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression of most of these genes varied modestly at different stages of growth and development. the gene encoding atpaps <dig> was a pollen-specific gene . several genes showed elevated expression in developing seeds  while others showed reduced seed expression . curiously, a subset of these genes showed dramatically reduced expression in pollen; this set of genes includes those encoding atcpsf <dig>  atcstf <dig>  and atpabn <dig> 

of all the tissues and growth stages represented in figure  <dig>  pollen was the most different. to extend this observation, the expression of all of the genes listed in table  <dig>  in pollen was plotted . this representation emphasizes the increased expression of atpaps <dig>  as interesting, however, was the dramatic reduction in expression  of three other genes – atcpsf <dig>  atcstf <dig>  and atpabn <dig>  several other genes also had reduced levels of expression in pollen, suggestive of a tissue-specific gene expression program that may yield a modified polyadenylation complex.

a similar analysis of expression in response to various abiotic stresses revealed that most polyadenylation-related genes responded modestly, if at all, to the battery of stresses represented in the nasc dataset . for the most part, polyadenylation-related genes were unresponsive to chemical or hormone treatments . cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis, increased the expression of the atpaps <dig> and atpaps <dig> genes, suggesting that these mrnas are relatively unstable  <cit> . many of these genes were affected by mutations in giberrellic acid-related pathways and were induced by imbibition, probably reflecting induction of expression upon germination. this was most predominant with the atfips <dig> gene, the expression of which was rather ga and imbibition-dependent.

the responses of these genes to various pathogen-related stimuli  was modest, with no poly – related gene showing more than 3-fold variation in response to the different treatments . dark or different light treatments had little effects on the expression of these genes .

a protein-protein interaction map of the arabidopsis polyadenylation apparatus
to better understand the functioning of the various plant polyadenylation factor subunits, a comprehensive set of pair-wise interaction assays was conducted. for this, a standard yeast two-hybrid approach was adopted. the protein coding regions for each of the arabidopsis genes listed in table  <dig> were cloned into the "ad" and "bd" yeast two-hybrid plasmids as described  <cit> . for most of these genes, the entire coding region was used. however, in some cases, the proteins were "broken" into domains, based on their predicted structures. this set of constructs  was then used to collate an exhaustive pair-wise interaction map of the polyadenylation factor subunits. in these assays, both combinations of clones  were tested whenever possible. some combinations could not be tested, since several of the proteins possessed transcriptional activation domain activity in the yeast system . interactions were assessed by plating several double transformants from "non-selective" media  on which growth is possible only if there exists an interaction between the test subjects. all such tests included negative controls  and positive controls [the sfn1/sfn <dig> combination  <cit> , or the atcstf77-atcstf <dig> combination, reported as being positive  <cit> , and confirmed in this study).

the results of this exercise are summarized in additional file  <dig> . of the  <dig> tested interactions,  <dig>  proved to be positive. limited confirmation tests suggest that these interactions are all authentic. specifically,  <dig> independent tests, using in vitro or co-purification techniques, have confirmed the interactions , and no tested two-hybrid interaction has been contradicted by other tests. thus, the positive interactions listed in additional file  <dig> are reliable.

the positive interactions  were displayed using cytoscape . from this exercise, it is apparent that the interaction network indicated by the two-hybrid study is extensively interconnected, as they are found to interact in the reciprocal yeast two-hybrid assays in most cases . however, it does resolves itself into three hypothetical complexes, centered around atfips <dig>  atcpsf <dig>  and a putative cfiim-like complex , respectively. the atfips <dig> and atcpsf <dig> subcomplexes are bridged by atcpsf <dig>  atcfis <dig>  and three atcstf subunits. additionally, atcpsf <dig> links the cfiim-like complex with the others. interestingly, the four atpaps isoforms and the three atpabn isoforms are all parts of the atfips <dig> subcomplex, although one atpaps isoform  is also directly linked to the atcpsf <dig> subcomplex. also of interest, one clps and one cfis isoform were positioned very differently from the other isoforms in the network. thus, while atclps <dig> was part of the cfiim subcomplex, atclps <dig> interacts independently with the two atfips isoforms and with one  of the atpaps isoforms. while atcfis <dig> interacts with atcpsf <dig>  atpaps <dig>  and atfips <dig>  the atcfis <dig> subunit interacts only with atfips <dig> 

the results of the meta-analysis of microarray data indicate that atpaps <dig> is a pollen specific gene, that atpcps <dig> and/or atpcps <dig> are probably restricted to small parts of the plants, and that pollen and seed have a reduced polyadenylation complex. when atpaps <dig> and atpcfs1+atpcfs <dig> are removed from the overall interaction network, very little changes as far as the overall topology is concerned . the cfiim-like complex reduces to but two subunits and the fips-paps hub loses one paps, but the general layout and inferred functionalities are otherwise unchanged. this representation is the best estimate for the network that exists in most cells in the plant.

in contrast, the reduction of the pollen network is more substantial, as shown in figure  <dig>  this is apparent in the smaller size of the cpsf complex and fips hub. of particular note is the absence of pabn and cfis in the pollen network. however, these changes do not affect the overall topology of the network, which retains the cpsf and cfiim complexes, the fips and cpsf <dig> hubs, and the bridging functions of two of the cstf subunits.

discussion
implications of the expression characteristics of arabidopsis genes encoding polyadenylation factor subunits
as a general rule, the expression of polyadenylation-related genes in arabidopsis is fairly consistent over a wide range of conditions . however, some interesting exceptions to this rule exist . the most interesting and striking exception is the pollen-specific expression of atpaps3; this gene encodes a putative cytoplasmic form of pap, and the restriction of its expression to pollen is reminiscent of the involvement of cytoplasmic paps in spermatogenesis in animals  <cit> . interestingly, the protein encoded by atpaps <dig> is truncated with respect to the other three arabidopsis papss, as well as when compared with its eukaryotic nuclear counterparts. moreover, this truncation leaves the protein without obvious nuclear localization signals. these observations suggest that atpaps <dig> is in fact a cytoplasmic enzyme, and plays functions during pollen development analogous to those fulfilled by the testis-specific cytoplasmic paps in mammals.

two developmental states stand out when it comes to the expression of polyadenylation-related arabidopsis genes. one of these is pollen. as noted above, one of the four arabidopsis paps, atpaps <dig>  is a pollen-specific gene. remarkably, however, several other polyadenylation-related genes have normalized expression values in mature pollen that are less than  <dig>  . these include the only genes for atcpsf <dig>  atcstf <dig>  and the three pabn isoforms, as well as the atcpsf73-i and atcfis <dig> genes. this observation suggests a different polyadenylation apparatus for pollen compared with other parts of the plant. three of these subunits – atcpsf <dig>  atcstf <dig>  and atcpsf73-i – are core components of their respective complexes in mammals and yeast, and the prospect that polyadenylation can occur in their absence is surprising. however, removal of these seven nodes from the overall polyadenylation factor interaction network does not change the overall nature of the network in a fundamental way . the absence of atcpsf <dig>  which in mammals recognizes the aauaaa hexamer, suggests that different polyadenylation signals are recognized in pollen compared with most other tissues in the plant. regardless of the details, the tissue-specificity in gene expression suggests that the plant poly apparatus is much more flexible than anticipated, capable of functioning with a reduced set of subunits. of course, these considerations are predicated on the assumption that the diminished mrna levels indicated by the microarray studies are reflected in reduced protein levels.

the other interesting developmental state is the seed. the genes encoding atcpsf <dig> and atcfis <dig> have normalized expression values between  <dig> and 10-fold higher in seed; this is seen in several controls that study gene expression in the seed in response to aba and imbibition . this suggests a possible specialization of the polyadenylation apparatus in the seed. the possible significance of this is not clear; in other studies of the 3'-utrs of seed-specific arabidopsis genes, no clear nucleotide composition or sequence preference in these genes was seen , apart from those that have been reported before  <cit> . thus, a possible link between polyadenylation complex architecture and novel poly signal usage is not indicated. the significance of the distinctive expression pattern of these two genes will have to be established by additional studies.

interaction network
the protein interaction network inferred from the yeast two-hybrid study resolves itself into three conceptual hubs. two of these hubs recall biochemical studies of the polyadenylation apparatus in mammals and yeast. one hub is centered around atcpsf <dig>  and includes atcpsf <dig>  atcpsf73-i, atcpsf73-ii, atcpsf <dig>  atpaps <dig>  and fy. with the exception of fy  and atpaps <dig>  this hub corresponds to the classical cpsf complex, that in mammals includes cpsf <dig>  cpsf <dig>  cpsf <dig>  and cpsf <dig>  the two-hybrid results presented here are corroborated by other studies, providing a strong degree of confidence in this part of the network. thus, the arabidopsis cpsf subunit orthologs interact in vitro in a way that is consistent with the interaction network  as well as atcpsf73-ii  are present in nuclear extracts, indicative of their in planta expression and nuclear localization  <cit> . these proteins reside in a protein complex, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation studies . interestingly, fy is part of these complexes  <cit> , lending support to the placement of this subunit as part of cpsf in plants.

from the protein-protein interaction patterns , it seems that both atcpsf73-i and atcpsf73-ii interact only with atcpsf <dig> among the polyadenylation factor subunits. moreover, they do not interact with each other or form homodimers in the two-hybrid assays, and their in silico expression properties show some degrees of specialized expression . these observations beg a question as to the relationship between the two atcpsf <dig> orthologs. there are two possible models for their positions and functions in the complex. in one, in some tissues, both subunits are associated at the same time with atcpsf <dig>  in which case they are not competing for the same binding site on atcpsf <dig>  alternatively, they could compete the same binding site on atcpsf <dig>  thus forming different complexes that exclude each other. this scenario should also apply to the tissues where these two genes are expressed differentially. preliminary results of deletion experiments indicated that both atcpsf73-i and ii interact with the c-terminal quarter of the atcpsf <dig> protein , arguing for the existence of different complexes.

symplekin was not included in the two-hybrid study, owing to some confusion at the outset of the project as to the nature of the apparent "split" gene encoding one of the two symplekin orthologs . however, the expression studies indicate that this interaction may only apply to the hypothetical pollen polyadenylation complex; thus, in most parts of the plant, there may be no corresponding link between the plant cfii complex and cstf <dig>  this is also true for the pcf11p-rna <dig> interaction that has been seen in yeast. whether this reflects a limitation of the two-hybrid assay or divergence in the sequence and function of pcf <dig> proteins is not clear. in this regard, it is possible that the clps-cpsf <dig> interaction observed in this study may serve a similar bridging function between the polyadenylation complex and the ctd of rna polymerase ii.

in mammals, hclp <dig> appears to be a bridge between cfim and cpsf  <cit> . such a role is not indicated by the results of this study. while the interaction of atclps <dig> with atcpsf <dig> is indicative of a link between the plant cfii complex and cpsf, there seem to be no direct physical links between either cfis isoform and the plant cfii. whether this discrepancy reflects limitations in the different approaches that have been used to assemble models for the polyadenylation complexes in different systems is not clear. however, resolution of the discrepancy with respect to the bridging functions of clps may reside in the absence of the larger cfis subunit in the present study.

the third hub of plant polyadenylation factor subunits centers about atfips <dig>  and includes the four paps isoforms, the three pabn variants, and single members of the cfis and clps subunit families. this hub has no obvious counterpart in the commonly-presented view of the mammalian polyadenylation apparatus  or in the yeast polyadenylation apparatus . however, the interactions of the paps isoforms with atfips <dig> in arabidopsis recalls the function of fip <dig> in yeast in recruiting pap to the rest of the complex. the "fips hub" involves a number of proteins that are members of protein families – papss and pabns, to be specific. moreover, with the exception of atcstf <dig>  all of the interactions with atfips <dig> involve the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of the protein. it is unlikely that the sum total of interactions inferred from the two-hybrid analysis occur in a single complex; rather, a small subset of these interactions may be in force at a given moment.

similar considerations factor into the discussion of the interactions involving atcpsf <dig>  while small in size, atcpsf <dig> interacts with many proteins in the complex , including atcpsf <dig>  atcpsf <dig>  atcfis <dig>  both fips orthologs, atpcps <dig>  atpcfs <dig>  and atclps <dig>  it may be that atcpsf <dig> is a hub around which these other subunits assemble in a large, static complex. however, atcpsf <dig> seems to be too small for all these proteins to bind at once. an alternative model would involve a scenario whereby these various interactions reflect a progression through the steps of the polyadenylation reaction. these considerations reinforce those raised above, and lend themselves to a model of the plant polyadenylation complex as a dynamic system that changes its subunit composition, either as a means of recognizing different rna substrates, interacting with other processes , or progressing through the polyadenylation reaction. it is also possible that different complexes are involved alternative polyadenylation of mrna.

perhaps the most obvious possible difference between the predicted plant complex and the mammalian counterpart lies in the relationships of cstf subunits with other members of the complex. in mammals, cstf <dig> is part of an identifiable heterotrimeric complex and interacts physically with another subunit of the complex, cstf <dig>  no such interaction is seen in the two-hybrid analysis nor in other in vitro studies  <cit> , and the position of atcstf <dig> in the arabidopsis network suggests that this protein is not a part of complex comparable to cstf. atcstf <dig> does interact with cpsf, atcstf <dig>  and paps, suggesting a novel bridging or assembly function. but such a role would seem to be different from that played by this protein in the mammalian polyadenylation complex.

the approach that we are taking can only identify the proteins that share homology with known mammalian and yeast polyadenylation factors. it is possible there are other proteins that may not share amino acid sequence homologies but functionally conserved. it is also equally possible that plants use additional proteins in the cleavage and polyadenylation process. these possibilities should be explored using different means, e.g. protein 3-d structure alignment search, proteomic and genetic approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
our results of mapping plant polyadenylation factor have paved the road for vigorous functional annotations of these proteins. the analysis of gene expression profiles of these genes point to formation of potential differential polyadenylation apparatus in different tissues and/or different stage of developments where specialized polyadenylation events may be warranted. the potential interacting partners combined with the gene expression profiles lay a blue print for searching differential polyadenylation machineries in various tissues and organs where alternative polyadenylation may occur.
