BACKGROUND
pantoea ananatis is a gram-negative, motile, facultative anaerobe belonging to the gamma proteobacteria. this bacterium can survive and multiply in a variety of ecological niches as a saprophyte, endophyte, epiphyte and pathogen  <cit> . in its latter role, p. ananatis infects a wide range of economically important plants. in south africa the pathogen causes disease on maize, onion and eucalyptus spp.  <cit>  but has also been reported to infect pineapple  <cit> , rice  <cit> , melon  <cit> , sudan grass and sorghum  <cit> . the mechanism of spread of p. ananatis between host plants is largely unknown. however, walcot et al.  <cit>  isolated virulent strains of p. ananatis from onion seeds, which went on to produce disease symptoms on susceptible onion plants  <cit> . in addition, gitaitis et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that tabacco thrips  were able to transmit p. ananatis into 52% of onion plants analysed  <cit> . these studies show that seeds and insect vectors are important sources of inoculation and could serve as vehicles for the spread of p. ananatis to different geographical regions. current control measures are limited to cultivation of resistant plant cultivars, eradication of infected plant material and/or the use of biocontrol in the form of lytic phages  <cit> . despite the wide geographical and host range of p. ananatis, there is limited information on the genetic determinants of virulence and ecological fitness of the species.

to date, seven different secretion systems have been described in bacteria; namely type i-vii  <cit> . these secretion systems release factors that modulate the host environment to favour bacterial fitness and, in some cases, virulence. the type vi secretion system  was first described by pukatzki et al.  <cit>  in vibrio cholerae and was shown to be required for virulence against amoeba and macrophages  <cit> . this secretion system consists of 15- <dig> different proteins, which assemble to form an injectisome-like structure similar to an inverted contractile phage particle  <cit> . the t6ss has since been identified in the genome of several pathogenic but also non-pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, suggesting that it may be involved in functions unrelated to pathogenicity  <cit> . the role of the t6ss in virulence, symbiosis, biofilm formation and stress has been documented in several bacteria  <cit> . in addition, the t6sss of pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas protegens, burkholderia thailandensis and serratia marcescens have been shown to secrete bactericidal effectors which inhibit growth of bacterial species that lack the cognate immunity protein  <cit> . similarly, the t6sss of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter baylyi, vibrio parahaemolyticus and citrobacter rodentium have also been to play a role in inter-bacterial competition  <cit> . some bacteria encode more than one evolutionarily distinct t6ss in their genome  <cit> . multiple t6ss gene clusters found in a given bacterial genomes are believed to have been acquired by independent horizontal gene transfer events, possibly to play different roles in the biology of different bacteria  <cit> .

this study focused on the t6ss of the pathogen pantoea ananatis. to date, the genome sequences for eight strains of p. ananatis are available, representing both pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. type ii, type iii and type iv secretion systems are well documented virulence determinants of several human and plant pathogens  <cit> , although genome mining showed that they were all absent from the genome of p. ananatis strain lmg  <dig>  <cit> . these findings raise the possibility that the t6ss of p. ananatis could play a role in either virulence or ecological fitness of the species. previous comparative studies identified three distinct t6ss loci on the genome of a single eucalyptus pathogenic p. ananatis strain lmg  <dig>  <cit> . thus to better understand the distribution of the t6ss in this versatile pathogen we carried out an in-depth comparative analysis of the t6ss in eight sequenced strains, of which three were recently sequenced as part of this study. to this end, we analyzed the gene content, sequence similarity, synteny, operon structure, and possible evolutionary history of each t6ss loci. pcr and dot blot hybridisations were used to study the distribution of the t6ss in  <dig> additional strains from a variety of niches. this study represents the first detailed intra-species comparative analysis of the t6ss in p. ananatis.

RESULTS
in silico identification of t6ss gene clusters in p. ananatis
the  <dig> conserved gene components of the t6ss from p. ananatis strain lmg  <dig>  <cit>  were used as a bait to identify the t6ss in all sequenced strains of p. ananatis. blastn and blastp searches were done using all eight currently available genomes of p. ananatis, which included the lpp- <dig> megaplasmid found in all sequenced strains  <cit> . in this manuscript we have used the standard t6ss gene nomenclature proposed by shalom et al.  <cit> . based on this nomenclature, the conserved t6ss genes were designated tss a-m/ , while the accessory or non-conserved t6ss genes were designated tag a-p   <cit> .

homologs of the t6ss genes were clustered in two distinct genomic regions in all sequenced strains of p. ananatis. these regions were designated pa t6ss- <dig> and pa t6ss- <dig> . the pa t6ss- <dig> gene cluster was located on the genome of all eight sequenced strains of p. ananatis while pa t6ss- <dig> gene cluster was located on a ~30 kb region of the lpp- <dig> megaplasmid of strains aj <dig>  lmg  <dig> and pa- <dig>  this 30 kb region was missing from the lpp- <dig> plasmid of p. ananatis strains lmg 2665t, lmg  <dig>  bd <dig>  b1- <dig> and pa- <dig>  we also found that pa t6ss- <dig> and pa t6ss- <dig> gene clusters contained all  <dig> core gene components of the t6ss  <cit> . in addition, we also identified a 9 kb region containing homologs of icmf and dotu in all eight sequenced strains of p. ananatis. this gene cluster, was designated t6ss- <dig> and was found to be missing the remaining  <dig> core gene components of the t6ss. whether or not pa t6ss- <dig> gene cluster encodes a functional t6ss or represents a truncated t4ss is currently unknown. however, this putative pa t6ss- <dig> gene cluster was included in this study for purposes of comparative analysis. the overall genetic organisation of each t6ss of p. ananatis is presented in figure  <dig>  the list of all core and accessory t6ss gene components found in the t6ss gene clusters of p. ananatis, including their putative functions and cog classification is presented in table  <dig> 
pantoea ananatis 
the type vi secretion system  and putative function 

tss  genes refers to the t6ss gene nomenclature propose by shalom et al.  <cit> . these genes have been shown to be essential for secretion of at least two proteins, hcp and vgrg and are conserved in the genome sequence of over  <dig> different bacteria encoding a t6ss similar to the prototype described by pukatzki et al.  <cit> .

operon structure of the t6ss
the t6ss encoded by most bacteria is organized in discreet transcriptional units or operons  <cit> , suggesting coordinated expression  <cit> . we therefore, investigated the organization of conserved genes in the p. ananatis t6ss. the core genes of pa t6ss- <dig> were clustered in three highly conserved operons; group  <dig>  group  <dig>  and group  <dig> . pa t6ss- <dig> showed a considerable level of gene shuffling compared to pa t6ss- <dig>  with gene order being highly variable between each of the different groupings. the consensus grouping in pa t6ss- <dig> included tssb-tssc-tssk-dotu and tssf-tssg-tssj-tsse, while tssh-vgrg and icmf-tssa were stand-alone operons linked to non-conserved t6ss genes. the start and stop codons of all  <dig> genes located in pa t6ss- <dig> gene cluster overlapped with each other, suggesting that pa t6ss- <dig> represents a single transcriptional unit. these different operon structures suggested the independent acquisition of the t6ss clusters, each of which may play a different role in the biology of p. ananatis.

distribution of the pa t6ss in other strains of p. ananatis
pcr and dot blot analysis
to determine the prevalence of the three pa t6ss clusters  <cit>  among p. ananatis strains, we analyzed the distribution of each t6ss cluster in  <dig> different strains of the pathogen. blastp analysis showed that the gene products of pa t6ss- <dig> and  <dig> shared less than 50% amino acid similarity . this low sequence similarity allowed specific pcr primers to be designed within conserved regions located on the dna sequence of the targeted genes. for primer design, the targeted t6ss gene homologs from eight sequenced strains of p. ananatis were aligned in bioedit using clustalw multiple alignment program and pcr primers designed within the conserved dna regions located on these genes. blastn analysis showed that the conserved regions used for primer design were not present on the dna sequences of t6ss gene homologs found in other clusters. we, therefore, saw no cross reactivity during the pcr amplification. the list of primers and strains of p. ananatis used for pcr analysis is provided in additional file 2: table s <dig> and additional file 3: table s <dig>  respectively.

pcr amplification showed that the t6ss- <dig> and t6ss- <dig> homologs were present in all tested strains of p. ananatis. pcr amplification using pa t6ss- <dig> gene specific primers identified homologs in only  <dig> of the  <dig> strains of p. ananatis  tested . the distribution of pa t6ss- <dig> was further confirmed by dot blot hybridization using probes for tssa, tsse, tssj and tssk . our results showed that pa t6ss- <dig> was present in strains of p. ananatis isolated from symptomatic maize, onion, pineapple fruit and eucalyptus spp. however, not all strains of p. ananatis isolated from the same host plant contained pa t6ss- <dig>  the cluster was only found in  <dig> of the  <dig> strains of p. ananatis  isolated from either maize, onion, pineapple and eucalyptus spp., while the remaining  <dig> strains, isolated from the same host but different plants, did not have the cluster. in addition, pa t6ss- <dig> was absent in all strains of p. ananatis isolated from symptomatic wheat , honeydew melon , rice  and sugarcane . these results suggest that pa t6ss- <dig> could be a host range or virulence determinant of p. ananatis. future studies will undertake pathogenicity and cross inoculation trials to validate this correlation. in addition, the cluster was also found in p. ananatis strains aj <dig> and yomogi- <dig> which have been shown not to cause disease on a range of host plants , suggesting that pa t6ss- <dig> could be involved in other processed related to the ecological fitness of the species.

comparative analysis of t6ss gene clusters from different strains of p. ananatis
homologous pa t6sss encoded by different strains of p. ananatis were highly conserved in terms of sequence similarity, gene content and operon structure . a detailed description of the genes found in individual t6sss encoded by all sequenced strains of p. ananatis analyzed in this study are provided in .

1) pa t6ss-1

the genetic architecture of pa t6ss- <dig> was shown to be conserved amongst all sequenced strains of p. ananatis. the tssd  and tssi  genes found in this cluster encoded hcp and vgrg proteins that do not have c-terminal extensions as found in “evolved” vgrg and hcp proteins  <cit> . the c-terminal extension of some evolved vgrg proteins, such as vgrg <dig> of v. cholerae and aeromonas hydrophila, have been associated with actin cross-linking and actin adp ribosylation activity in mammalian host cells, respectively  <cit> . p. ananatis strains pa- <dig>  bd <dig>  b1- <dig> and lmg  <dig> had a single vgrg gene, while strains aj <dig>  pa- <dig>  lmg  <dig> and lmg 2665t had an additional copy of vgrg. these vgrg genes appear to encode vgrg proteins with different domain architectures, characterized by the presence or absence of a c-terminal beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase domain . this c-terminal domain is associated with lysozymes belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>   <cit> . it is possible, therefore, that the different vgrg proteins encoded by each vgrg gene are mobilized to the t6ss baseplate under different physiological conditions or play different roles either as effectors, structural elements or both.

regions associated with hcp and vgrg contain genes that encode a variable number of accessory and hypothetical proteins that account for strain specific differences. the first variable region in pa t6ss- <dig> is located between the major rhsd element and vgrg. genes found in this region encode mostly hypothetical proteins and proteins with either a paar  repeat or pentapeptide_ <dig> domains. paar repeat proteins of bacteria have categorised into different classes  based on their domain architectures  <cit> . paar repeat proteins of several bacteria have effector domains on the n or c-terminal  <cit> . some of these effector domains include: transthyretin, lipase, nuclease, deaminase, and adp-ribosyl transferase  <cit> . the genes products of pa- <dig> pagr_g <dig> and lmg  <dig> pana5342_ <dig> belong to the class  <dig> paar domain architecture proteins and share 100% sequence similarity . in addition, pagr_g <dig> and pana5342_ <dig> have no n or c terminal extensions and showed structural homolog to the paar repeat protein of v. cholerae . a recent study showed that the paar repeat proteins of e. coli and v. cholerae bind to the gp5-vgrg complex by means of non-covalent interactions  <cit> . in addition, paar repeat proteins of v. cholerae and acinetobacter baylyi were shown to be bactericidal effectors associated with t6ss-mediated killing of e. coli <cit> . these findings have led to the speculation that, paar repeat proteins carrying different effector domain located on either their n or c-terminal extensions may also bind to the vgrg spike and mediate secretion of these effectors by the t6ss  <cit> . it is also speculated that paar repeat proteins may form non-covalent interactions with different effectors, thereby recruiting them to the t6ss spike complex  <cit> . it is, therefore, possible that the paar repeat proteins encoded by genes located in the vgrg island of p. ananatis t6ss- <dig> gene cluster may either be t6ss effectors associated with inter-bacterial competition or may mediate secretion of other effectors.

paar-repeat domains are also found in the rhsd gene of pa t6ss- <dig>  a recent study, aimed at identifying polymorphic toxins in bacterial genomes using comparative analysis, sequence and structural analysis, identified rhsd as putative t6ss effectors of p. ananatis, based on the presence of paar repeats on this protein  <cit> . similarly, the rhsd protein of serratia marcescens was recently identified in a t6ss secretome analysis, suggesting that this protein is secreted by the t6ss  <cit> . bacteria rhs proteins have been associated with different phenotypes such as social motility, inflammasome-mediated cell death, virulence in mice, insecticidal toxin production, polysaccharide transport and bacteriocin production  <cit> . in addition, the rhsa and rhsb genes of dickeya dadantii encode endonuclease toxins which have been associated with contact-dependent killing of other bacteria species  <cit> . toxin producing strains of d. dadantii also express the cognate immunity factors from the rhsi gene located downstream of the rhsa and rhsb genes  <cit> . the rhsd locus of p. ananatis has a genetic organization similar to that of d. dadantii consisting of the rhsd gene which is followed by the rhsi homolog . in addition, p. ananatis rhsd genes have a conserved n-terminal domain and a variable c-terminal domain which is characteristic of several bacteria rhs toxins   <cit> . we identified a duf <dig> domain of unknown function on the c-terminal extensions of rhsd proteins of p. ananatis strains b1- <dig>  lmg 2665t and lmg  <dig>  which is missing from the remaining strains. furthermore, the rhsd proteins of strains b1- <dig>  lmg 2665t and lmg  <dig> showed extensive structural homology to the insecticidal yenc <dig> toxin of yersinia entomophaga   <cit> . these findings suggest that the rhsd loci associated with the t6ss- <dig> gene clusters of p. ananatis may encode different toxin/immunity factors which play different roles as either bactericidal or insecticidal toxins. alternatively, rhsd proteins of p. ananatis may mediate secretion of other t6ss effectors which are non-covalently associated with either their n or c-terminal extension, as predicted for other paar proteins  <cit> .

homologs of tagab and tagb, which encode pentapeptide repeat proteins were also identified in the vgrg islands of p. ananatis strains pa- <dig>  aj <dig> and lmg  <dig>  in strain pa  <dig>  the pentapeptide repeat proteins are encoded by pagr_g <dig> and pagr_g <dig> which correspond to tagab and tagb genes, respectively. sequence analysis performed on pagr_g <dig> and pagr_g <dig> predicted no signal sequence and no transmembrane helices  <cit> . psortb analysis predicted the gene product of pagr_g <dig> to be a secreted effector while the sub-cellular localization of pagr_g <dig> protein is unknown  <cit> . homologs of tagab and tagb genes have also been in identified in the t6ss gene clusters of serratia marcescens, azotobacter vinelandii, burkolderia bronchiseptica, including the t6ss- <dig> gene clusters of b. mallei, b. pseudomallei and b. thailandensis, however, these genes have not been functionally characterised and the biological function of their gene products is currently unknown  <cit> .

the second variable region found in p. ananatis t6ss- <dig> gene cluster is located between hcp and tagh and contains a gene encoding a protein with a peptidoglycan binding domain . in strain lmg  <dig>  the protein is encoded by pana5342_ <dig> and showed structural homology to the lytic transglycosylase enzyme of pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage phikz  while the corresponding homologs found in strains lmg  <dig>  pa- <dig>  b1- <dig> and aj <dig> showed structural homology to the pesticin toxin of yersinia pestis . pesticin and lytic transglycosylase enzymes are bactericidal effectors which degrade peptidoglycan by cleaving the β- <dig>  glycosidic bond between n-acetylmuramic acid and the n-acetylglucosamine moieties  <cit> . these findings suggest that genes found in the hcp island of p. ananatis t6ss- <dig> cluster may encode bactericidal effectors which are functionally related to the type vi secretion glycoside hydrolase effectors 1- <dig>   <cit> . genes encoding proteins with the pg_binding domain were not identified in the t6ss- <dig> hcp island of p. ananatis strain lmg 2665t. however, the gene product of lmg 2665t n454_ <dig> showed weak structural homology to colicin s <dig> of escherichia coli . colicin s <dig> is a pore-forming bacteriocin which kills bacteria species not expressing the immunity factor  <cit> . it is, therefore, possible that the gene product of lmg 2665t n454_ <dig> may be a bacteriocidal effector which plays a role in inter-bacterial competition. we did not identify homologs of type vi amidase 1- <dig> , type vi lipase effectors 1- <dig> , small secreted proteins 1- <dig>  and type vi secretion exported  <dig>   <dig>  in the t6ss- <dig> gene cluster of p. ananatis, based on sequence and structural analysis  <cit> .

2) pa t6ss-2

the genetic architecture of pa t6ss- <dig> is highly conserved in all strains that harbor the cluster. pa t6ss- <dig> was found to contain a single vgrg gene that encodes a vgrg protein with an additional c-terminal duf <dig>  domain of unknown function. conserved domain architecture analysis showed that this domain was conserved in the vgrg genes of several different bacteria. all strains of p. ananatis that harbor this cluster encode two copies of the tssa gene within the cluster showing 22% amino acid similarity. duplication of the tssa gene has also been reported in the t6ss gene clusters of vibrio cholerae, escherichia coli o157:h <dig>  yersinia pseudotuberculosis and salmonella enterica serotype gallinarum  <cit> . the reason for this duplication is unknown, as is the exact role that tssa plays as an essential t6ss structural protein.

two variable regions were identified in pa t6ss- <dig>  which contained genes encoding non-conserved t6ss components and hypothetical proteins. the first variable region is located between tssa and tssf and encodes several strain specific hypothetical proteins including proteins with a paar_motif. the genes products of lmg  <dig> pana_ <dig>  aj <dig> paj_p <dig> and pa- <dig> n455_ <dig> contain  <dig> amino acids, sharing 99% amino acid similarity and belong to the class  <dig> paar domain architecture proteins. furthermore, these paar proteins all contained identical c-terminal extensions with no putative effector domains. the gene products of pana_ <dig>  paj_p <dig> and pa- <dig> n455_ <dig> may either be t6ss effectors or mediate secretion of other effectors bound to their c-terminal extensions  <cit> . the second variable region in pa t6ss- <dig> gene cluster is located between icmf and vgrg. this region in lmg <dig> contains four genes  encoding hypothetical proteins with homologs present in strain aj <dig> but is missing from strain pa- <dig>  pana_ <dig> encodes a protein with a peptidase_m <dig> domain. this protein is a putative endopeptidase and is predicted to be a t6ss effector based on its high structural homology to the secreted chitinase g of streptomyces coelicolor <cit> . the corresponding variable region in p. ananatis strain pa- <dig> contains a gene with an esterase_lipase domain and belongs to the family lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase . this protein is predicted to be involved in extracellular metabolism of plasma lipoproteins, including cholesterol  <cit> . genes with an esterase_lipase domain have been found in the vicinity of vgrg genes outside the major t6ss of pseudomonas spp. in p. aeroginosa these genes form part of the “cargo” genes predicted to have been acquired by recent horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . in addition, the n455_ <dig> gene which is located in the vgrg island of strain pa- <dig> t6ss- <dig> cluster, encodes a class  <dig> paar domain architecture protein containing  <dig> amino acids with no n or c-terminal extensions. this paar protein may play a role as a t6ss effector associated with inter-bacterial competition  <cit> . homologs of functionally characterized t6ss effectors such as type vi lipase effectors 1- <dig>  type vi amidase 1- <dig>  type vi secretion glycoside hydrolase effectors, small secreted proteins 1- <dig> and type vi secretion exported 1- <dig>  were not identified in p. ananatis t6ss- <dig> gene cluster, using sequence analysis and structural homology search tools.

3) pa t6ss-3

comparative analysis of pa t6ss- <dig> showed that there was no variability of this cluster between the different strains of p. ananatis. the genetic architecture, gene order and gene content of pa t6ss- <dig> was conserved in all sequenced strains of p. ananatis. interestingly, all genes found in pa t6ss- <dig> showed high sequence similarity to genes found in pantoea sp. at-9b, pantoea sp. ab-valens, p. vagans c9- <dig>  p. agglomerans e <dig> and erwinia billingiae eb <dig>  these pantoea and erwinia spp. have a homologous cluster highly similar to pa t6ss- <dig> in terms of gene content and operon structure  <cit> . the high conservation of this cluster suggests a strong selective pressure to maintain the gene content and order, although its specific role is unknown. the fact that the cluster is missing  <dig> core gene components of the t6ss suggests that this system does not encode a functional t6ss, although this is yet to be confirmed.

“orphan” hcp and vgrg proteins
when the t6ss genes hcp and vgrg are present outside the t6ss they are often referred to as “orphan” vgrg and hcp genes. our analysis did not identify “orphan” vgrg genes in any of the sequenced genomes of p. ananatis. however, we identified three different “orphan” hcp genes in p. ananatis strain pa- <dig> . these “orphan” hcp genes were designated hcp- <dig>  hcp- <dig> and hcp- <dig> to correspond to pagr_g <dig>  pagr_g <dig> and pagr_g <dig>  respectively. genes hcp- <dig> and hcp- <dig> are adjacent to each other and have homologs present in all sequenced strains of p. ananatis, while hcp- <dig> is restricted to p. ananatis pa- <dig>  multiple alignments of the amino acid sequences of representative p. ananatis hcp proteins showed that hcp- <dig> protein is highly divergent from hcp- <dig>  hcp- <dig> and t6ss-associated hcp proteins . all “orphan” hcp genes in p. ananatis are found in the vicinity of genes encoding hypothetical proteins and a putative endoribonuclease syme, which is part of an sos inducible toxin/antitoxin system  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether “orphan” hcp genes of p. ananatis are association with the major t6sss, as either t6ss effectors or structural proteins, or whether the conserved association between syme and “orphan” hcp genes is important in other aspects of the biology of p. ananatis.

phylogenetic analysis of the t6ss
phylogenetic analysis was used to infer the evolutionary history of the t6ss using the maximum likelihood method base on the le and gascuel  + g + f amino acid substitution model, as determined by prottest  <cit> . representative bacteria from the different t6ss phylogenetic groups a-d were included in the analysis  <cit>  . the analysis showed that pa t6ss- <dig> belonged to phylogenetic group a, while pa t6ss- <dig> belonged to group c . pa t6ss- <dig> was phylogenetically closest to t6ss loci  <dig> of pantoea sp at-9b , while pa t6ss- <dig> was closest to t6ss loci  <dig> of erwinia amylovora cfbp <dig> . our phylogenetic analysis resembled the analysis performed by bingle et al.  <cit>  which showed that phylogenetic group a to d contained pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria associated with different ecological niches  <cit> . similarly, functionally characterized t6ss with a known role in virulence or inter-bacterial competition were represented in the different groups. for example, the h1-t6ss of p. aeruginosa which is known secreted tse <dig> to  <dig> antimicrobial effectors was found in group a while the t6sss of vibrio cholerae and peudomonas. syringae pv tomato with a similar role in inter-bacterial competition belonged to group d  <cit> . in addition, all four phylogenetic groups contained bacteria t6sss which have been associated with virulence. together, these finding suggest that bacteria t6sss found in phylogenentic group a to d are evolutionarily distinct and play different roles in pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria  <cit> .

our phylogenetic tree also showed that p. ananatis t6ss- <dig> and t6ss- <dig> clustered away from the t6ss of several important plant pathogens such as xanthomonas citri, x. campestris, x. oryzae, pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, pectobacterium atrosepticum scri <dig>  pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasiliensis. functional studies have shown that the t6ss gene clusters of p. atrosepticum and p. syringae are only partially required for disease development. the t6ss mutants of these bacteria were either only slightly reduced in the ability to cause disease or caused disease symptoms on susceptible host plants similar to the wild type strains  <cit> . these findings, together with our t6ss phylogenetic groupings, suggests that 1) the t6ss of different plant pathogens were acquired from unrelated bacteria or distantly-related ancestors, 2) the t6ss clusters found in different phytopathogens may play different roles depending on the host plant or ecological niche, and 3) t6ss- <dig> and t6ss- <dig> may play an important role in the virulence of p. ananatis in susceptible host plants.

to infer the evolutional history of “orphan” hcp genes  in p. ananatis we constructed a second maximum likelihood tree using the general reverse transcriptase  + i + g + f amino acid substitution models, as determined by prottest  <cit> . our phylogenetic analysis also included representative t6ss-associated hcp genes and “orphan” hcp genes from other bacteria . the resulting phylogeny revealed four distinct clusters, which we have designated as hcp cluster 1- <dig> to distinguish them from t6ss phylogenetic group a-d  <cit>  and group i-v  <cit> . our results indicate that hcp- <dig> and hcp- <dig> belong to cluster  <dig>  together with the t6ss-associated hcp genes found in pa-t6ss- <dig> . hcp- <dig>  belongs to cluster  <dig>  together with t6ss-associated hcp genes present in pa-t6ss- <dig>  hcp- <dig>  however, forms part of a subset of cluster  <dig>  and was phylogenetically close to orphan hcp proteins from klebsiella varriicola at- <dig> and erwinia amylovora atcc baa- <dig>  these hcp groupings suggest either independent acquisition of “orphan” hcp genes from different ancestors or gene duplication and rearrangement of t6ss-associated hcp genes.

CONCLUSIONS
comparative analyses of the t6ss in the genomes of sequenced strains of p. ananatis identified three putative gene clusters pa t6ss- <dig>  pa t6ss- <dig> and pa t6ss- <dig>  the former two of these were potentially functional as they contained the  <dig> core genes necessary for synthesis of a functional t6ss  <cit> . pa t6ss- <dig> was widespread in the genome of all sequenced strains including environmental isolates, while pa t6ss- <dig> was plasmid borne and restricted mostly to pathogenic strains of p. ananatis isolated from certain classes of plants. this finding suggests a potential association of pa t6ss- <dig> with host range determination. however, the finding that pa t6ss- <dig> and pa t6ss- <dig> were present in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of p. ananatis supports the concept that the t6ss may evolve to play different roles unrelated to pathogenicity, e.g. competition against other microbes, fitness and/or niche adaptation  <cit> . the genetic organization and phylogenetic groupings of pa t6ss- <dig> and − <dig> further suggests that these clusters were independently acquired to play differing roles in the different strains of p. ananatis. furthermore, the variable regions associated with hcp and vgrg genes could account for specialization of each t6ss based on the needs of the specific strain. in the future, key questions that need to be addressed include determining: 1) whether the t6sss of p. ananatis are functionally active and what roles they play in host-pathogen interactions and fitness; 2) which in vitro and in vivo conditions activate the t6sss; 3) the presence of different potential effectors secreted by the t6sss of p. ananatis and their physiological relevance to fitness and host-pathogen interactions; and 4) how t6sss are regulated in these strains.
