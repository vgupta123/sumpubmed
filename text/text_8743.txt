BACKGROUND
the genus actinidia lindl. is large, containing between  <dig> and  <dig> species of climbing plants originating mainly in southern china  <cit> . over the past  <dig> years kiwifruit has developed into an important horticultural crop, firstly in new zealand, and subsequently in other countries such as chile, china and italy  <cit> . currently cultivars from three species are grown commercially; the green-fleshed kiwifruit, actinidia deliciosa  c.f.liang et a.r.ferguson, the closely related yellow-fleshed a. chinensis planch. and the kiwiberry, a. arguta  planch. ex miq. most of the kiwifruit cultivars grown commercially are seedling selections and there has been little systematic breeding  <cit> . consequently there are still many characteristics within the genus  that could be incorporated into commercial cultivars  <cit>  and to do this efficiently requires a better knowledge of how these characteristics are regulated. for the consumer, critical desirable attributes of kiwifruit are flavor and fragrance, appearance, healthful components and convenience.

flavor and fragrance are determined by the chemical composition of the fruit. a wide range of compounds has been detected within the actinidia genus leading to distinct and different flavors in the fruit  <cit> . these compounds include polyphenolics, acids, alcohols and volatile compounds such as terpenes and esters. flavor is also influenced by the sugar to acid balance, with some growers currently receiving a premium for sweeter fruit. actinidia fruit color ranges from the original green kiwifruit, newer yellow varieties as well as red, purple and orange fruit . the extensive range of colors is caused by the presence or absence of chlorophyll, anthocyanins and carotenoids  <cit> . healthful attributes of kiwifruit include its high ascorbic acid levels  <cit> , quinic acid levels  <cit> , and the presence of triterpenes and folic acid. on the other hand, allergens are identified as undesirable health attributes in kiwifruit and in many other fruit  <cit> . convenience includes such factors as the ability to store the fruit for a long time  <cit>  and a long shelf life, as well as easy determination of eating ripeness and having an edible or peelable skin. little is currently known about the genetic diversity and gene-based control of these major attributes in kiwifruit.

est databases as resources for uncovering genetic diversity have been established for many plant species . most comprehensively surveyed are arabidopsis  and rice , both of which have been fully genome-sequenced. fruit crops have been less extensively surveyed, but recently there have been reports on est projects from fruit, including tomato , grape , apple  and pineapple . however, there are few ests sequenced from the ericales  registered in genbank . these significant fruit est resources have been used to identify genes likely to be involved in the ripening process in tomato  <cit>  and in the generation of aroma in apple  <cit> . in addition, ests are useful sources of simple sequence repeats  and single-nucleotide polymorphisms , both of which are useful markers for creating genetic maps in plants  <cit> .

knowledge of the actinidia genome or transcriptome is currently restricted to the  <dig> sequences available in genbank . to improve and develop new varieties of kiwifruit with the desired flavor, health and convenience attributes, it is useful to use modern genomics techniques in conjunction with breeding tools such as marker-assisted selection and genetic transformation. for this reason, we undertook a major est sequencing project in actinidia to develop a basic genetic resource covering a range of different species and tissues. in this paper we analyze more than  <dig>  ests, derived mainly from four species in the actinidia genus . this information is presented with reference to the chemical composition of these species and using specific examples where we have increased our understanding of the genetic diversity and gene-based control of critical attributes.

the number of ests was calculated by amalgamating libraries from the same tissues.

a other miscellaneous species were actinidia setosa , a. hemsleyana , a. polygama  and a. indochinensis .

b see additional file 2a for full details of libraries and tissues.

c empty cells had no ests sequenced.

RESULTS
overview
actinidia cdna libraries were constructed mainly from four actinidia species: a. deliciosa, a. chinensis, a. eriantha and a. arguta . the libraries were constructed from petals, fruits, buds and leaves, with a small number from roots and cell culture and sequenced from the 5' end. the average edited sequence length of the  <dig>  ests was  <dig> bases. clustering these sequences using a 95% threshold resulted in  <dig>  tentative consensus  sequences , with  <dig>  ests remaining as singletons. the combination of tcs and singletons are referred to as non redundant  clusters. these numbers are similar to those observed with apple  <cit> . over 95% of tcs had fewer than  <dig> est members, and the largest single tc had  <dig> members. it should be noted that a. chinensis and a. deliciosa are more closely related to each other than the other species mentioned in this paper, and that only a restricted number of genotypes within each species was used in making est libraries compared to the total numbers available.

sequence analysis
codon usage
knowledge of the gc content of a genome and codon usage is useful when devising pcr-based strategies for mapping and gene isolation, as well as for hybridization studies by microarray. based on the coding regions of  <dig> a. deliciosa,  <dig> a. chinensis and  <dig> a. eriantha full-length cdnas, the gc content in the third base position was estimated to be 55%, 49% and 58%, respectively. these values are higher than the overall gc ratio from the sequences of the complete est datasets of a. deliciosa , a. chinensis  and a. eriantha , indicating that there is some pressure, particularly in a. deliciosa and a. eriantha, towards an increased gc ratio in coding regions compared with non-translated regions. overall the codon usage of the three actinidia species is similar, although not identical . a. deliciosa and a. eriantha differ in only their preference for aspartate  and serine . in contrast, comparative codon preferences between a. deliciosa and a. chinensis show differences for alanine , glycine , isoleucine , leucine , asparagine , glutamine , threonine  and valine . in most of these codons, a. chinensis shows a greater preference for an a or t in the third base position, accounting for its lower gc third base percentage when compared with the other two species.

polymorphisms and genetic markers
both snps and microsatellites or ssrs are valuable tools for genetic mapping within breeding populations of many crops. a total of  <dig>  biallelic snps were detected from the overlapping regions of  <dig>   of the  <dig>  tcs, at a rate of one snp every  <dig> bp. this frequency is higher than that reported in apple using a dataset of comparable size . as several actinidia species were used to construct the cdna libraries, while the apple cdna libraries were from different varieties of the same species, this increased frequency of snps could reflect the greater genetic diversity in the surveyed actinidia est libraries. for example the frequency in apple increased significantly to  <dig> in  <dig> bp when a greater diversity of genotypes was added . the polyploidy nature of several of the actinidia species used may also have affected snp frequencies. as a result of this, some of the snps identified may not be allelic in nature but due to homoeologous or paralogous sequences clustering in the same tc.

est-derived ssrs have already been shown to be valuable mapping tools in actinidia chinensis  <cit>  where  <dig> ssrs with more than  <dig> dinucleotide repeat units were tested as markers in an a. chinensis mapping population. more than 90% of the ssr markers were polymorphic and segregated within the population. subsequently,  <dig> of these ssrs were shown to be transportable across multiple species of actinidia, showing the value of this resource  <cit> .

compared with apple  <cit> , where less than 20% of the nrs contained a microsatellite, over 30% of actinidia nrs were found to have at least one. the other major difference between apple and actinidia was that, while di- and tri-nucleotide repeats were equally frequent in apple at  <dig> to 8% frequency, di-nucleotide repeats  were twice as frequent as tri-nucleotide repeats  in actinidia. tetra-nucleotide repeats were found at similar frequencies in nrs for the two genera. the lengths of the ssrs were similar in both apple and actinidia, with 50% of the repeats having between  <dig> and  <dig> bases. as in apple, ag repeats were the most frequent  and were followed by at  and ac  while gc repeats were very infrequent.

the position of ssrs in relation to the putative initiation atg was very similar when comparing actinidia with other plants such as arabidopsis and apple  <cit> , with di-nucleotide repeats being predominantly  in the 5' utr, and tri-nucleotide repeats being more evenly distributed along the gene .

comparative genomic dna hybridizations by microarray
a  <dig>  feature actinidia oligonucleotide microarray was constructed based on sequence data from the actinidia est database. the 44– <dig> mer oligonucleotides were derived from gene sequences of different actinidia species . to test the cross hybridization between the different genomes of the actinidia species, genomic dna from two actinidia species  was hybridized to two different microarray slides. a plot of average signal intensity for the two species against each other is shown in fig.  <dig>  of the  <dig>  informative features, the majority  showed a similar level of hybridization between the two species , with  <dig> showing a higher signal intensity in a. deliciosa , and  <dig> showing a higher intensity in a. eriantha . there was no correlation between the species from which the oligonucleotide was derived and the increased or decreased level of hybridization . consequently, the increases are probably due to separate gene duplications in each species.

functional analysis
highly populated tentative consensus sequences
the tc with the greatest number of ests was a cysteine proteinase  followed by a metallothionein  . however, when similar proteins were taken into account , there were  <dig>  ests matching cysteine proteinases followed by  <dig> metallothionein protein-encoding ests.

it was not surprising to identify the cysteine protease actinidin as the most highly abundant tc cluster in actinidia. actinidin can constitute up to 50% of soluble protein in mature a. deliciosa fruit at harvest  <cit> . recent research has shown that this cysteine protease exists in basic and acidic forms and the amount of each form varies between species, with fruit of the important a. chinensis cultivar 'hort16a' being almost devoid of acidic actinidin  <cit> . ests for actinidin occur throughout the fruit libraries that make up the database, and these cluster into  <dig> distinct genes/alleles  <cit> . as two of the key fruit libraries were subtracted for actinidin, the number of ests in the tc is likely to be an under-representation of the actual number. the function of this protease may be related to insect defense  <cit> .

the metallothionein tc cluster contains a gene  previously identified in kiwifruit  <cit>  as being highly expressed in young fruit with reduced expression in the later stages of fruit development. however, the in vivo function of the metallothionein tc cluster is currently unknown. interestingly, pineapple also had a high proportion of metallothionein ests  <cit> .

fourteen tcs in actinidia with their proteins annotated by biolview as "not assigned-unknown" proteins  were highly expressed with over  <dig> est members. four of the unassigned tcs contained more than  <dig> est members. these four tcs included kiwellin  <cit> , which is a homolog to a grape ripening-related protein  <cit>  with no arabidopsis homologs ; a homolog of at5g <dig>  a protein of unknown function ; a senescence-related protein ; and an aba stress-related protein .

functional analysis using mapman and interpro
functional analysis of ests and nrs using mapman  <cit>  is shown in table  <dig>  the analysis was conducted by identifying each nr's nearest homolog to arabidopsis, using blastx and identifying domains/families that are indicative for a given function using interproscan. then that nr and its member ests were assigned to the corresponding bin of the arabidopsis match. of the  <dig>  nrs,  <dig>  had sufficient homology to an arabidopsis sequence to assign it a functional classification in mapman. thus, 32% of nrs from actinidia had no arabidopsis homolog, but a proportion would have homologs in other crops .

bin code
a actinidia nrs were assigned to a mapman  bin according to their nearest arabidopsis blast hit. ests belonging to the actinidia nr were then assigned to the same bin.

b potato and arabidopsis functional assignments were as described  <cit> 

a comparison of the percentage of nrs assigned to the top level mapman classification bins and the percentage of arabidopsis genes classified in the same bin showed a strong relationship with an r <dig> value of  <dig>  and a slope of  <dig> , near to the expected 1: <dig> slope. the same relationship when calculated for second level bins gave an r <dig> of  <dig>  and a slope of  <dig>  . taking only those top level bins that contained more than  <dig> nrs to remove chance as a major factor, only two bins appeared to be over-represented  in actinidia, namely bin  <dig>  and bin  <dig> . this may reflect a high level of primary metabolism in fruit. interestingly, when all nrs are included, bin  <dig>  and bin  <dig>  were added to the list of over-represented nrs. the same relationships for potato showed no anomalies . this analysis demonstrates that the clustering of ests generated a fair representation of the distribution of genes.

overall, the average number of ests per nr in the database was  <dig> . there were only two bins with a high number of ests per nr, bin  <dig>  with over  <dig> ests per nr and bin  <dig>  with over  <dig>  however, bin  <dig> had a low number of nr and est members, suggesting this result may have occurred by chance. in contrast, bin  <dig> included the metallothioneins and the very highly expressed est discussed earlier .

tcs with high numbers of ests  came from  <dig> of the  <dig> mapman bins  <cit>  with approximately three quarters falling into the bin names "not assigned, no ontology", "protein degradation", "metal handling binding chelation and storage", "stress biotic", "cell wall degradation" and "secondary metabolism isoprenoids".

the most common interpro families  <cit>  were also analyzed . there were  <dig>  interpro families  represented in the actinidia nrs, with the most nrs found in the protein kinases grouping. following that were thioredoxins, while cysteine proteinases, which had the highest number of ests in the database, were represented as the 7th most frequently occurring nr.

genes related to flavor and fragrance
understanding the relationship between fruit flavor and the genetic diversity present in the est database requires a detailed analysis of the flavor and fragrance compounds present in the actinidia genus. fruit and flower samples from the major actinidia varieties that were used to produce the est database were characterized using both headspace sampling and solvent extraction followed by gc-fid/ms analysis. the results of this compound analysis are presented in additional file  <dig> for esters , acids, alcohols and terpenoids.

compound analysis
the most abundant volatile compounds in the flowers of these actinidia species were alcohols and terpenes. a. chinensis flowers contained 71% sesquiterpenes, largely dominated by farnesols . a. deliciosa flowers had the highest volatile ester content at around 12%, and aromatic  and straight-chain alcohols . these flowers were notable for their α-farnesene  and germacrene d  content. a. arguta flowers contained branched-chain  and aromatic alcohols , and monoterpenes , which were mostly linalool oxidation products reported previously  <cit> . a. eriantha flowers contained few volatile compounds, the notable ones being 2-phenylethanol , 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one , and β-myrcene . the flowers from two further actinidia species showed distinct volatile profiles. a. polygama flowers contained linalool oxides  and dehydroiridodial , a monoterpene related to the nepeta cataria  compounds  <cit> . the flowers of a. indochinensis flowers were dominated by 2-phenylethanol  and a couple of terpenes, the major one being linalool . the aromas from these flowers have also had descriptors attached . for example a. eriantha has been described as coconut and berry, and a. arguta with descriptors including sweet, lime, rose and vanilla  <cit> . a chinensis and a. deliciosa are described as having tea-rose aromas, sweet, fresh, lilac and violet, while a. polygama has gardenia and lime descriptors. these descriptors reflect the diversity of volatile compounds found in the actinidia flowers.

in fruit, esters accounted for up to 85% of the total volatiles. the main a. chinensis esters were the fresh, fruity ethyl butanoate which, depending upon analytical method and genotype, ranged from  <dig> to 54%, and butyl butanoate, both of which are common fruit esters  <cit> . a. chinensis 'hort16a' fruit contained significant amounts of eucalyptol  which has been described as having a fresh, pungent cooling taste  <cit> . acetaldehyde, hexanal, e-2-hexenal and ethyl butanoate are known to be important contributors to hort16a aromas  <cit> . ethyl butanoate along with methyl butanoate and ethyl acetate were the major  compounds in the green a. deliciosa fruit and are known to be major volatile contributors to its flavor  <cit> . the other major compound was ethanol , with only trace levels of other alcohols and terpenes. whilst at more modest levels in a. arguta fruit , ethyl butanoate was still substantial. a. arguta fruit were notable for their content of methyl- and ethyl benzoate, which are responsible for the distinctive aroma of feijoa  fruit  <cit> , and also camphor . the dominant ester in a. eriantha fruit was butyl acetate , a flavor compound found in many fruit, which has a strong, fruity odor and a taste reminiscent of pineapple  <cit> . however, the total volatile level in a. eriantha is lower than other species and the number of esters is also lower .

ester biosynthesis
esters are synthesized from their acid and alcohol precursors by acyltransferases . we identified  <dig> ats in the actinidia est database, of which  <dig> are full length. these sequences were analyzed for their phylogenetic relationship with other plant ats of known function . two clades were identified that contained enzymes involved in the synthesis of flavor-related esters . the first contained alcohol acyltransferases  from apple, melon and banana and nine aats from actinidia , while the second clade contained aats from strawberry and three aats from actinidia . an actinidia at predicted to be involved in esterifying anthocyanins  and two ats predicted to be anthranilate acyltransferases  were also identified. three actinidia ats were closely related to the carboxylesterase-related protein  <dig> cer <dig> and therefore predicted to be elongases  possibly involved in wax production.

multiple sequences of the same genes were recovered for some genes reflecting orthologs, alleles or sequences from different genomes within polyploid genomes. for example, the three ats, acat <dig>  adat <dig> and adat <dig>  and the two ats, aaat <dig> and adat <dig>  are probable variants of just two different aats. a. deliciosa is a hexaploid  possibly explaining this multiplicity of genes. we may have uncovered at least one instance where, for a single aat, all three genomic versions have been isolated .

carboxylesterases conduct the opposite reaction to ats, i.e. the hydrolysis of esters into acids and alcohols  <cit> . as well as ester hydrolysis, plant carboxylesterases have been implicated in isoflavonoid biosynthesis  <cit> , plant defense  <cit> , and hormone regulation  <cit> . analysis of actinidia flowers and fruits showed a wide range of acids and alcohols .

previously published plant carboxylesterase  genes from genbank were used to identify cxe genes in the actinidia est database using blast searches. the sequence alignment of cxes revealed amino acid motifs and secondary structural features characteristic for members of the α/β hydrolase fold superfamily and more particularly of cxes such as an active site serine surrounded by a gxsxg motif.

in actinidia  <dig> cxes were identified,  <dig> of which are full length . these include cxe members likely to encode gibberellin receptors , an isoflavanone dehydratase  and an ortholog of a plant defense-associated cxe . other cxes from actinidia align well with arabidopsis cxes and can be associated with the classes identified elsewhere  <cit> . the structure of an actinidia cxe is now available , the first plant cxe to have its structure solved  <cit> . aecxe <dig> can hydrolyze a range of substrates from c <dig> to c <dig> esters, with a preference for c <dig> moieties. there are two cxes from actinidia  that may be orthologs to aecxe <dig> from a. eriantha.

terpene biosynthesis
actinidia terpenoid compounds such as monoterpenes , sesquiterpenes  diterpenes , triterpenes , carotenoids, sterols, phytols and quinones are derived from two common precursor molecules, isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate. these precursors are produced via the cytoplasmic mevalonate pathway or the chloroplastic 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate  pathway  <cit> . genes for enzymes in both these pathways are present in the actinidia est database, with the results for analysis of ests in the early steps of the mevalonate pathway shown in fig.  <dig>  the conversion of these precursors into other intermediates of the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway, including geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate, is carried out by polyisoprene synthase genes . over  <dig> ests with sequence homology to known polyisoprene synthase genes were found in the actinidia est database including  <dig> ests with similarity to dimethyallyltranstransferase ,  <dig> ests with homology to known monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases and  <dig> ests homologous to squalene synthase . no ests for phytoene synthase  were identified.

the est database collection has been used to identify a multifunctional terpene synthase gene from a. deliciosa flowers that produces the sesquiterpene germacrene d and a range of other sesquiterpene products at lower abundance  <cit> . this gene is represented by  <dig> sequences in the est database.

genes related to color
chlorophyll catabolism
green fleshed commercial kiwifruit such as a. deliciosa 'hayward' are characterized by the retention of chlorophylls in the flesh of ripe fruit  <cit> . in contrast, the newer yellow-fleshed fruit cultivars  degrade the chlorophyll during ripening and the consequent loss of the green color uncovers the underlying yellow carotenoid pigmentation.

the degradation of chlorophylls  is controlled by catabolic enzymes in the chlorophyll degradation pathway  <cit> . actinidia ests discovered in the pathway of chlorophyll breakdown are shown in fig.  <dig>  chlorophyllase is the first enzyme of the catabolic pathway and it removes the phytol chain from chlorophyll a. homologs of this enzyme have been mainly identified in libraries of vegetative tissues  of a. deliciosa and a. chinensis. homologs of pheophorbide a oxygenase have also been identified, with eight ests representing two genes from fruit libraries of a. chinensis. this enzyme is responsible for opening the tetrapyrrolic ring of the chlorophyll molecules, the critical step for the loss of green color. surprisingly, we did not identify any ests of red chlorophyll catabolite reductase, an enzyme associated with pheophorbide a oxygenase and required to complete the porphyrin ring opening and the degradation of chlorophyll.

carotenoid biosynthesis
the fruit of many actinidia species contain a range of carotenoid pigments, including β-carotene and lutein  <cit> . the yellow-fleshed kiwifruit a. chinensis 'hort16a' develops as a green-fleshed fruit, but on ripening the chlorophyll is degraded exposing the carotenoids in the yellow flesh. ests for most steps in the biosynthesis of carotenoids  <cit>  are present in the actinidia est database , except the first step, phytoene synthase. ninety eight ests for phytoene desaturase were identified, with  <dig> coming from a. deliciosa libraries, and the remainder from a. chinensis libraries. of these  <dig> ests,  <dig> came from a single a. deliciosa fruit library with eight from bud and meristem libraries. of the  <dig> ests found for lycopene β-cyclase,  <dig> were from petal tissues and  <dig> from fruit libraries. these ests were largely found in libraries from a. deliciosa  and a. chinensis , with only one est from a. eriantha. in contrast, only a single est was found for lycopene ε-cyclase, which is the enzyme required with lycopene β-cyclase to convert lycopene to α-carotene  <cit> . there were five ests of β-carotene hydroxylase found in petal , leaf  and dormant bud  libraries, but only a single est was present for ε-carotene hydroxylase. both of these enzymes are required for lutein synthesis  <cit> .

flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthesis
flavonoids are polyphenolic secondary metabolites synthesized through the phenylpropanoid pathway  <cit> . anthocyanins are a subgroup of the flavonoids, which appear red to blue, depending on the ph, due to additions to their phenolic rings. in red fruit of a. chinensis and a. deliciosa, the predominant anthocyanins are cyanidin-based and the preferred glycosylation is in the 3' position  <cit> . while many of the kiwifruit libraries came from tissue with low levels of anthocyanins, several libraries were derived from tissue containing anthocyanins, including red fruits, brown skins and pink petals, leaves and buds .

the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway was analyzed by blast searching for ests representing different enzymes in the pathway . chalcone synthase  was a highly represented gene family in the est database with ~ <dig> ests. there appeared to be three distinct chs nrs, possibly representing three genes, that are found in mostly young a. eriantha fruit libraries, as well as in bud and petal libraries. there was only one apparent chalcone isomerase  nr and over half the ests for this gene were found in shoot and bud libraries. two distinct flavanol 3-hydroxylase  nrs were found, with ests predominantly found in bud and cell culture libraries. only one flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase  nr was found, from a. eriantha fruit, while ests for two distinct flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase  nrs were predominantly found in shoot and bud libraries. of the four potential dihydroflavonol reductase  nrs, the most highly represented was found in bud and young fruit. three nrs, perhaps representing three gene families, of leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase  were found in the est database, with most ests in bud libraries. the ests with highest sequence similarity to udp-glucose flavonoid 3-o-glucosyltransferase  are also predominantly found in developing buds of a. deliciosa.

many of the ests for anthocyanin biosynthesis were sequenced from young fruit libraries  and in a. deliciosa buds. developing buds from a. deliciosa appear to be a darker red color and therefore presumably accumulate more anthocyanins than buds from a. chinensis and a. eriantha, so it is not surprising to find ests for these later biosynthetic steps in bud tissue from a. deliciosa. however, ests for genes encoding enzymes from the early steps in the flavonoid pathway  are found in unpigmented a. eriantha fruit suggesting these tissues may accumulate a different class of flavonoids.

most of the enzymes for anthocyanin biosynthesis are well represented in the est database except for f3'5'h. this is not surprising given the only anthocyanins identified in a. deliciosa and a. chinensis are glycosylated in the 3' position. there are, however, species within the genus actinidia, such as a. melanandra, that accumulate high levels of delphinidin, a different aglycone that would require f3'5'h activity. no ests from these species were sequenced.

genes related to healthful components
ascorbic acid-related genes
kiwifruit are well known to be high in ascorbic acid , with values in commercial varieties ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> mg per  <dig> g fresh weight of fruit  <cit> , and with a. eriantha having up to  <dig> times as much again. ascorbic acid is synthesized in plants from glucose, through three potential pathways: the l-galactose pathway, the galacturonate pathway and through myo-inositol  <cit> . myo-inositol is a major sugar alcohol found in kiwifruit . the only pathway that is well established is the l-galactose pathway for which all the enzymes have now been identified in plants  <cit> . many of the genes are known for the other two potential pathways, but several steps are still unknown. the actinidia est database was searched for ests similar to genes known to encode steps in these pathways. the numbers of ests homologous to various identified genes in the three pathways of ascorbic acid biosynthesis are shown in fig.  <dig>  surprisingly for these high vitamin c plants, while the number of ests found in early steps in all the pathways is relatively large, the number of ests found in the two last steps is much lower, with no examples of ests encoding the last step of two of the pathways, that catalyzed by l-galactono lactone dehydrogenase.

quinic acid metabolism
fruit from actinidia species have a relatively high total acid content  of which 40–60% can be quinic acid, 40–60% citric acid and 10% malic acid . quinic acid comprises an even higher proportion of the total acids during early fruit development  <cit> , and over 25-fold variation in quinic acid content can be found in fruit of a single a. chinensis cross  <cit> . kiwifruit are unusual in having such a high content of quinic acid as a fresh fruit, although levels of quinic acid in cranberry juice can be around 1%  <cit>  and peaches can have up to  <dig> % quinic acid  <cit> .

quinic acid is a key intermediate in lignin biosynthesis, folic acid metabolism, aromatic acid synthesis, anthranilate biosynthesis, and purine metabolism. the molecular and enzymatic control of quinic acid storage and metabolism may affect all these pathways. however, little is known about quinic acid metabolism in actinidia species. ests for all the enzymes in the quinic acid biosynthetic pathway to shikimate , except for a quinate dehydrogenase, have been identified in the actinidia est database.

of the  <dig> ests identified for dehydroquinate synthase, eight were found in fruit or petal libraries, the rest were sequenced from bud or leaf libraries. of the  <dig> ests identified for the bifunctional dehydroquinate dehydratase/shikimate dehydrogenase,  <dig> were from fruit or petal libraries and five from bud or leaf libraries. these ests were found mainly in libraries made from a. deliciosa and a. chinensis tissues and to a lesser extent in a. arguta and a. eriantha libraries, reflecting the distribution of ests among the species. an enzyme has been reported with predominantly quinate dehydrogenase activity  <cit> , but the gene for this enzyme has not been cloned.

allergens
food allergies are estimated to affect ~6% of young children and ~3% of adults  <cit> . kiwifruit have been recognized as a potentially allergenic fruit for over  <dig> years and reported allergies to kiwifruit are increasing  <cit> . most allergy symptoms to kiwifruit are quite mild, but severe reactions have been reported, particularly in young children  <cit> . allergies have been recorded in all three commercial species of actinidia  <cit> .

the actinidia est database contains sequences with homology to many known plant allergen proteins  <cit> . potential allergens include the 2s albumin proteins, lipid transfer proteins, thaumatin-like protein , α-amylase/trypsin inhibitors, latex allergens, plant chitinases, profilins, cystatins, bet v  <dig> homologous proteins and plant seed globulin allergens. however, only a small number of potential kiwifruit allergens have been directly confirmed by immunological testing, including the cysteine protease actinidin , an unidentified  <dig> kda protein , and all but one est contained the  <dig> conserved cysteine residues characteristic of this protein class  <cit> . the various nrs could be aligned and clustered into  <dig> or  <dig> groups , with two nrs accounting for the bulk of the ests .

globulin proteins  have been reported from a wide range of seeds, including cereals  <cit>  and legumes  <cit> . globulin-like proteins are also found in a. thaliana  <cit>  and a gene family of  <dig> globulin-like genes are present in arabidopsis gene databases , ). 11s globulins are composed of sets of polymorphic subunits derived from a multigene family. they exist as hexamers with molecular mass between  <dig> and  <dig> kda, or as trimers. 11s globulin subunits consist of two polypeptide chains linked by at least one s-s bridge between cysteine residues at highly conserved positions in the acidic alpha-chain and basic beta-chain. both chains are post-translationally generated from a common precursor protein, which represents the product of one member of the multigene family  <cit> . 11s globulins have been shown to be related to the 7s globulins through sequence comparisons  <cit> .

a blast search of the actinidia est sequence database with a range of previously identified globulin protein sequences identified two ests with a predicted protein sequence matching 11s globulin, both from a library made from a. chinensis whole fruit, which included seeds. other related sequences from actinidia fruit libraries belonged to the 7s vicilins-like family , which were found in only fruit-based libraries from a. deliciosa, a. chinensis and a. arguta. these libraries would have all included seeds. a third grouping of sequences was identified that we have named other globulins  . the og group appears to be more closely related to the 7s globulins than to the 11s . all three groupings are supported by the clustering of the arabidopsis globulin genes as well as globulin genes from other species. while most og ests were found in fruit libraries , which included seeds, some members of the og family were found in fruit skin, buds and petal libraries, suggesting a role other than as seed storage proteins. these og ests were found in libraries derived from a. deliciosa , a. chinensis , a. arguta , and a. eriantha .

genes related to fruit softening
some kiwifruit cultivars exhibit outstanding storage characteristics e.g. a. deliciosa 'hayward' fruit can be stored for 4– <dig> months at 0°c. other actinidia species exhibit a range of ripening and softening behaviors  <cit> . a. eriantha develops a peelable skin as the fruit ripen, a. arguta ripens in less than  <dig> days at 20°c versus 20– <dig> days for a. deliciosa and a. chinensis  <cit> , whilst some small-fruited actinidia genotypes tend to remain firm even towards the end of the ripening process  <cit> .

the main chemical changes occurring in the cell wall during kiwifruit softening are pectin solubilization and degradation, reduction in the molecular weight of xyloglucan, and galactose loss from pectin side chains. microscopically, the cell wall shows extensive swelling, until at the end of the softening process dissolution of middle lamellae can be observed  <cit> . these processes eventually lead to disintegration of the cell wall. although similar chemical changes occur in other fruit  <cit> , these changes occur concurrently with ethylene production and the respiratory climacteric. in kiwifruit, however, most of the softening process is well separated temporally from the climacteric and ethylene production .

the genes for many enzymes involved in the key chemical changes in the cell wall during ripening are represented in the actinidia est database. three enzymes involved in pectin degradation  are particularly abundant with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ests, respectively. genes encoding expansin, a protein implicated in pectin solubilization early in the kiwifruit softening process  <cit> , are also highly abundant . galactose loss from fruit cell walls during the softening process has been attributed to the action of β-galactosidases  <cit> . a β-galactosidase from ripe kiwifruit has been purified. however, the activity of the enzyme in vitro against synthetic or purified native substrates from kiwifruit was far too low to account for the amount of galactose loss observed during softening  <cit> . ninety β-galactosidase ests were observed in fruit libraries in the est database and are good candidates for genetic manipulation and to study the role of this enzyme. during softening, xyloglucan is also hydrolyzed. as xyloglucan and cellulose create the major load-bearing network of the cell wall, any xyloglucan degradation is thought to weaken the cell wall, resulting in softening of the fruit. in kiwifruit, hydrolysis of xyloglucan occurs mainly during the rapid softening phase. endoglucanases and xyloglucan transglucosylase/hydrolase  enzymes are implicated in this process. xths catalyze both hydrolytic and transglucosylation reactions, and an xth enzyme capable of carrying out both reactions has been isolated from kiwifruit  <cit> . this particular xth, however, is expressed late in kiwifruit ripening, when xyloglucan degradation has already come to an end. the  <dig> xth ests found in fruit libraries will allow the identification of genes involved in hydrolysis of xyloglucan during the rapid softening phase. ests for enzymes that act on minor kiwifruit cell wall components such as galactoglucomannans or glucuronoarabinoxylans  <cit>  were less abundant in the est database ,  <dig> ests found in fruit).

discussion
we report on a significant resource of over  <dig>  ests derived from a range of actinidia species . we targeted tissues and developmental stages in order to sample genes involved in physiological and biochemical processes including fruit ripening, flavor development, control of color and the synthesis of chemicals with health-related attributes. for this reason, the two most widely cultivated species of kiwifruit, a. chinensis and a. deliciosa, are well represented with together over  <dig>  ests . in addition, fruit and bud libraries are also well represented, with over  <dig>  and  <dig>  ests, respectively. a. chinensis and a. deliciosa are so closely related, as is a. setosa  c.f. liang et a.r.ferguson, that they are variously treated as being distinct species or as varieties of the one species. the other two main species studied, a. arguta and a. eriantha benth., also have commercial potential but are more distantly related  <cit> .

the genus actinidia is unusual in how much inter-taxal and intra-taxal variation in ploidy and in the wild, there is a structured reticulate pattern of diploids, tetraploids, hexaploids, and octoploids in diminishing frequency, associated, in at least some taxa, with geographic separation of ploidy races. a. deliciosa is hexaploid, a. setosa is diploid, and there are diploid and tetraploid races of a. chinensis, the tetraploids apparently coming from a restricted part of the natural distribution of the species. most evidence suggests that diploid a. chinensis was a progenitor of tetraploid a. chinensis and hexaploid a. deliciosa but it is not clear whether genomes from other species have contributed. the basic chromosome number  is high and it seems increasingly likely that diploid a. chinensis is itself a rediploidized palaeopolyploid  <cit> .

as is common in est sequencing projects . we would expect this number of nrs to be an overestimate of the number of genes in actinidia, especially given that the database contains sequences from multiple species of actinidia. using the same correction used in the apple est paper  <cit> , we expect an actinidia genome to have around  <dig>  genes.

on average 20%  of the sequences from each library with over  <dig> ests were singletons suggesting a high degree of novelty in these libraries. on average 28%  of sequences did not have a homolog in the various public databases based on blast searches with an e value >  <dig> e- <dig>  an average of 16%  of ests were identified as 3' utr candidates based on the presence of a poly tail within  <dig> bp of the start . these 3' sequences would not be expected to be identified by blast searches and so would affect the novelty of a library. less than 12% of nrs did not have blast matches  in the arabidopsis proteome, uniref, ncbi ref or swissprot databases.

there was only a small degree of overlap in nrs between libraries. libraries from different species and different tissues showed a  <dig> to 9% overlap in nrs, libraries from different species but the same tissue showed an  <dig> to 10% overlap and libraries from the same species but different tissue showed a  <dig> to 13% commonality in nrs. these comparisons were made over five large libraries with more than  <dig>  est members each and an average of  <dig>  ests per nr. these results suggest that there were more nrs in common between libraries made from the same tissue or from the same species, but this tendency was not particularly marked.

detecting snps using an automatically assembled est database is a cost effective way to discover new dna polymorphisms and develop novel markers, although it can be a challenging task, especially in polyploid actinidia species. a significant proportion of the sequence variants predicted from overlapping ests within an nr will correspond to "real" snps, which means the sequence differences found are allelic variants of a given locus and not sequencing errors or differences between paralogs, homoeologs or orthologs. homoeolog snps could be particularly common in the polyploid accessions of species such as a. deliciosa and a. arguta that make up a large proportion of this database, but are also possible in diploids as a result of conserved gene pairs of paleopolyploid origin. allelic snps can be used directly and converted into molecular markers for genetic mapping, population genetics and linkage disequilibrium studies or for marker-assisted selection. a snp marker for determining the sex of kiwifruit seedlings  <cit>  has already been successfully utilized. since the database contains sequence data from multiple species, and ~40% of tcs are made up of more than one species, several snps were detected in the actinidia est database corresponding to sequence between orthologous loci from different actinidia species. hence, they cannot fully be considered as allelic snps, but more as species-specific variations. however, as kiwifruit breeding programs often use controlled crosses between different species, the interspecific snps will segregate in the progeny and be useful as markers.

the incidence of ssrs in nrs was higher in actinidia  than in apple , and the frequency of di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide ssrs differed between these two species. this increase was evident in all of the sequence classes but greatest in ag and ac . even though the actinidia genome est resource represents several species, while apple came mainly from one species, this would not explain these differences. perhaps the longer period of domesticity in apple, based on a narrow genetic basis compared to kiwifruit, may explain the difference. alternatively it may reflect that a greater proportion of homoeologs have grouped into tcs in the polyploid kiwifruit data than in the apple dataset.

overall the codon usage of the three actinidia species shares many similarities with that of other dicotyledons represented in the codon usage database  <cit> . comparisons with arabidopsis codon usage showed that a. deliciosa and a. eriantha differ markedly for  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively, whereas a. chinensis differs in its preference for eight particular amino acids. further comparisons with apple, grape, pear, peach, loblolly pine, tomato, citrus, potato and tobacco showed that the codon preference of the actinidia species is most similar to that of apple  <cit> . a. deliciosa differs from apple only in its codon preference for aspartate, glycine, isoleucine and leucine. a. eriantha also differs from apple for these four amino acids and also serine. the codon preference for a. chinensis and apple also differ for only four amino acids, these being asparagine, glutamine, threonine and valine. cpg suppression is also evident in actinidia species with an xcg/xcc ratio of between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the three species evaluated. this modest level of suppression of the cpg di-nucleotides is similar to that of apple  and differs markedly from that of arabidopsis which shows nearly no suppression  and from the high level found in grape . this may well reflect different levels of methylation in the coding sequences used by different species of plants.

mapman was used to assign function to the actinidia nrs and thus to their constitutive ests. only 32% of the ests did not have an arabidopsis homolog at e <  <dig> e- <dig>  in general, the functional distribution of nrs was very similar to the functional distribution of arabidopsis proteins  suggesting that the sampling of actinidia ests well represented the major functional classes of plant genes. this is surprising given the biased selection of libraries with virtually no root ests sequenced. however, the high number of bud meristem libraries meant that genes expressed in metabolically active dividing tissue were sampled.

fruit of the actinidia genus show several characteristics that distinguish them from other fruit species. these include flesh color , chemical composition including high vitamin c and quinic acid contents, and a novel aroma composition , characterized by the abundant esters. in addition, kiwifruit has been identified as a fruit with a potential to cause allergenicity among consumers, although this is a problem common to many other fruit. for this reason, we analyzed the actinidia est database to identify genes involved in these pathways and products. these analyses showed the depth and usefulness of the database for selecting candidate genes for most steps in the selected pathways. the other useful characteristic of the actinidia est database is the wide range of genetic and phenotypic diversity sampled across the actinidia genus  and the value of using this diversity to discover novel traits through functional genomics and through mapping and positional cloning approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper describes an est resource in the actinidia genus and discusses many of the properties of this collection. however, there is still a tremendous challenge in understanding the molecular basis of the genetic diversity of this genus, and we expect putting this est resource into the public domain will enhance future understanding of the genetic basis of the many divergent traits in this fruit.
