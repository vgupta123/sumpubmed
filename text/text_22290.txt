BACKGROUND
solvents such as acetone, butanol and ethanol  produced through microbial fermentation represent important potential renewable fuels and chemicals  <cit> . clostridium acetobutylicum and c. beijerinckii are among the prominent solvent-producing species. although c. beijerinckii is phenotypically similar to c. acetobutylicum, the saccharolytic strains are phylogenetically distant from the amylolytic c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig> type strain  <cit> . c. beijerinckii exhibits a broader substrate range and optimum ph for growth and solvent production  <cit> ; thus it may have greater potential for biosolvent production than c. acetobutylicum.

the genome of c. beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> was sequenced by the doe joint genome institute in  <dig> . the genome size is  <dig>  mb, which is 50% larger than that of c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig>  the c. beijerinckii  <dig> solvent-producing genes are all located on the chromosome, as opposed to the location of these genes on a mega-plasmid in c. acetobutylicum  <dig>  although transcriptome structural organization is important in order to reveal the functional and regulatory architecture of the genome, such annotation for the c. beijerinckii  <dig> genome is far from complete. current genome annotation was made by computational analysis based on gene prediction algorithms. although this allows for the determination of the complete set of gene loci and intergenic regions of the genome, it does not provide sufficient information concerning the transcriptional organization on a genome-wide level. for example, transcriptome structures such as operon linkages and transcript boundaries, etc. are not well understood and lack confirmation with experimental approaches. next-generation high-throughput sequencing technology enabled us to obtain millions of cdna reads simultaneously. in rna-seq analysis, these reads can be assembled against the genome sequence, and expression values calculated based on the reads mapped to genes. deep sequencing of cdna pool allowed us to study the bacterial transcriptome structure and gene expression at an unprecedented resolution and depth  <cit> . in this study, we used rna-seq technology to investigate c. beijerinckii  <dig> transcriptome structure at a single-nucleotide resolution. we identified the transcription start sites and operon structure throughout the genome. we confirmed the structure of important gene operons involved in metabolic pathways for acid and solvent production in c. beijerinckii  <dig>  we defined important operons related to chemotaxis/motility, transcriptional regulation, stress response and fatty acids biosynthesis. we discovered  <dig> previously non-annotated regions with significant transcriptional activities and  <dig> genes whose translation start codons were likely mis-annotated. the results from this study significantly enhanced the accuracy of current genome annotation, and provided an essential reference point for other researchers working in related fields.

RESULTS
growth kinetics and abe fermentation
c. beijerinckii  <dig> grew rapidly with a very short lag phase in the batch fermentation with p <dig> medium supplemented with yeast extract and glucose . the fermentation experienced a shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis at approximately  <dig> - <dig> h. formation of solvents was detected at between  <dig> - <dig>  h after the start of fermentation, which corresponded to the late exponential growth phase. butanol continued to increase throughout the stationary phase . samples for rna isolation were collected at time points during acidogenesis  and solventogenesis  . the combined information from these samples collected at different growth phases is representative for transcriptome structural analysis.

transcriptome definition and structure
the 75-nt cdna reads were mapped to the c. beijerinckii  <dig> genome. only those reads that mapped unambiguously to the genome were used for further analyses . collectively, around  <dig> % of the c. beijerinckii  <dig> genome was transcribed in at least one sample, even though the fraction in each single sample was much less.

*sample  <dig> was sequenced with  <dig> sample/lane, while samples 1- <dig> with  <dig> samples/lane. see methods section for more details; **pseudogenes included.

the sequence coverage per base was plotted and visualized using the genome browser artemis and dnaplotter  <cit>  . the sequence coverage of the genes  for different samples was observed to be different in the overall sequence coverage profiles, which might be a reflection of the physiological states as the cell transited from one growth phase to another. for example, sample  <dig> represented a time period that was at the beginning of the transition from acidogenesis to solventogenesis. in this sample, genes encoding butyrate kinase , acetyl-coa acetyltransferase , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , fructose-bisphosphate aldolase , aldehyde dehydrogenase , acetoacetate decarboxylase  were all actively expressed . these genes are involved in acid and butyryl-coa formation, solventogenesis and glycolysis. the time frame of sample  <dig> was consistent with the transition to non-active growth and clostridial spores formation. in this sample, genes encoding stage v sporulation protein t , spore coat protein cotjc , spore coat peptide assembly protein cotjb , small acid-soluble spore protein, sspa , small acid-soluble spore protein, sspc <dig>  were actively expressed among others . these genes are involved in the regulation of spore coat assembly and other sporulation-related processes  <cit> . these results were in good agreement with our previous observation using a 500-gene set dna microarray  <cit> . a more detailed genome-wide transcriptional analysis of c. beijerinckii  <dig> during the shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis is currently underway in our lab.

the distinct transcript boundaries and multigene operon structure in a genome are essential for elucidating a genome's regulatory mechanisms. through transcriptome profiling analysis, the transcript boundaries and operon structures were identified across the entire c. beijerinckii  <dig> genome . of all the >  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes  were determined as being parts of multi-gene operon structures. the largest number of genes in a single operon was  <dig> . a refined genome annotation file  was generated  based on the findings from this work and the current c. beijerinckii  <dig> genome annotation in ncbi. the genbank file can also be downloaded from https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/blaschek/www/wang-bmc <dig> 

in addition, 5'-untranslated regions  were determined at the same time. similar to other bacteria  <cit> , most of the identified 5'-utrs were very short. among all the  <dig> 5'-utrs that were estimated with high confidence ,  <dig> were ≤  <dig> nt, and only  <dig> were ≥  <dig> nt . ribex  <cit>  was used to test for the putative regulatory elements among the 5'-utrs over  <dig> bp. three predicted riboswitch-like elements  were found in the 5'-utrs of cbei_ <dig>  cbei_ <dig> and cbei_ <dig>  respectively. in addition, a known riboswitch-like element  riboswitch) was found in the 5'-utr of cbei_ <dig>  more details about the identified putative riboswitches were described in additional file  <dig> table s <dig> 

previously, an operon containing genes encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , phosphoglycerate kinase  and triosephosphate isomerase  was revealed by transcriptional analyses for c. acetobutylicum, while the gene encoding phosphoglycerate mutase  was identified as not a member of this operon  <cit> . in this study, employing the single-nucleotide resolution sequence data, a similar gap-pgk-tpi operon was observed, upstream and apart from pgm for c. beijerinckii  <dig>  in addition, it is very interesting that the upstream gene cbei_ <dig> was also found to be linked with this operon , which was validated by end-point rt-pcr as discussed below . the upstream gene  of gap in c. acetobutylicum  <dig> genome is conjectured to be the counterpart of cbei_ <dig> in c. beijerinckii  <dig>  since they both encode putative transcriptional regulator proteins and share 64% sequence identity. however, the intergenic distance between ca_c <dig> and ca_c <dig> in c. acetobutylicum  <dig> genome is  <dig> nt, while that between cbei_ <dig> and cbei_ <dig> in c. beijerinckii  <dig> genome is only  <dig> nt. although cbei_0596- <dig> are organized in the same operon, the sequence coverage depth downstream of gap was unexpectedly lower than that of the anterior . an intrinsic terminator was predicted adjacent and downstream of gap  using the bacterial genome transcription terminator prediction software transterm  <cit> . the terminator may have played a key role in attenuating the transcription of the downstream genes in this operon. further experiments need to be carried out to confirm the activity and function of this element.

the butyryl-coa formation related genes in c. acetobutylicum  <dig> encoding 3-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase , crotonase , and butyryl-coa dehydrogenase  were identified as a bcs  operon in the order of crt-bcd-etfb -etfa -hbd  <cit> . a homologous operon structure was observed for c. beijerinckii  <dig>  transcribed in the same order but the opposite direction . in addition, based on the sequencing data, similar pfk -pyk , pta -ack , ptb -buk gene operons were identified in c. beijerinckii  <dig> as those described in c. acetobutylicum  <dig>  <cit>  . among them, ptb-buk operon was also verified by end-point rt-pcr experiment as discussed below .

nearly all the genes encoding solventogenic enzymes have been cloned and characterized in c. acetobutylicum  <cit> . in c. acetobutylicum  <dig>  the genes adhe , ctfa  and ctfb  are located in the sol  operon on the mega-plasmid psol <dig> whose loss leads to the degeneration of the strain  <cit> , while adc  is organized in a monocistronic operon in the opposite direction  <cit> . in this study, a sol operon organized in the order of ald-ctfa-ctfb-adc was observed . previously, chen and blaschek  speculated that the ald, ctfa, ctfb and adc genes were located in an operon following a northern hybridization analysis of c. beijerinckii  <dig> total rna  <cit> . with direct sequencing data, this study successfully confirmed the above hypothesis, and identified the transcriptional start sites  upstream of ald gene. this solventogenic gene arrangement in c. beijerinckii  <dig> is consistent with that observed in c. beijerinckii nrrl b <dig> and c. saccharoperbutylacetonicum n1- <dig>  <cit> .

a flagellar/chemotaxis gene operon  was previously defined in c. acetobutylicum  <cit> ; a counterpart organized in exactly the same order  in c. beijerinckii  <dig> was observed in this study . similarly to c. acetobutylicum  <dig>  the transcriptional regulator sigf operon was also confirmed in c. beijerinckii  <dig> with the sequencing data that includes the forespore-specific sigma factor gene sigf, the anti-sigf factor gene spoiiab, and the anti-anti-sigf factor gene spoiiaa . in bacillus subtilis and c. acetobutylicum, the class i heat shock genes are organized in dnakj  and groesl  operons  <cit> . the similar organization of dnakj and groesl operons for c. beijerinckii  <dig> was also observed in this study . the fatty acid biosynthesis genes are organized in a single fab operon in c. acetobutylicum   <cit> , while in this study, the fab genes  in c. beijerinckii  <dig> were observed to be organized in four operons, which is similar to those of b. subtilis  <cit>  .

while the current c. beijerinckii  <dig> genome was annotated based on bioinformatical predictions, the rna-seq sequencing approach provides additional experimental evidence for genome annotation. by comparing the sequence coverage data to the genome annotation,  <dig> non-annotated regions were found to have significant transcriptional activities . these regions may represent potential new genes or regulatory rnas. twelve potential new genes were predicted in these regions using genemark  <cit> . additional details about this test and the predicted genes were summarized in additional file  <dig> table s <dig> 

in addition,  <dig> transcripts were identified with tss that are downstream of the current annotated translation start sites . for these regions, re-annotation is needed since the current start codons may have been mis-annotated.

putative silent genes
based on rna-seq sequence data,  <dig> protein-encoding genes demonstrated no transcripts over all six sampling time points, and these genes are likely silent . thirty-one out of them were genes encoding hypothetical proteins. in addition, half of the genes encoding transposases  were silent. although transposases may have played important roles during the evolution of c. beijerinckii, most of them are not as functional any more during the course of a batch fermentation. besides, several genes encoding the subunits  of phosphotransferase system  related to the transport of sugars other than glucose were also among the list of silent genes. since glucose was the only carbohydrate used in this study, these enzymes were not induced during the fermentation process.

putative housekeeping genes 
some genes have little variation in expression level through the entire fermentation process, and they are regarded as putative housekeeping genes . for accurate gene expression quantification, normalization of gene expression against hkgs  is generally required. in this study,  <dig> protein-coding genes were identified as putative hkgs with the lowest coefficient of variation  in rpkm  values among all the sampling points   <cit> . a cog functional group analysis by fisher's exact test found that cog functional category d , l  and e  were overrepresented in this list  <cit> . this list of putative hkgs was generated based on the transcription data obtained from the six samples under the certain batch fermentation conditions employed in this study. this list can be considered as a starting point for identifying hkgs for c. beijerinckii. however, whether these genes are stably expressed under different experimental conditions requires further study.

a prediction of the promoters for primary sigma factors for all the putative hkgs was carried out using bprom . in total,  <dig> promoters along with their corresponding - <dig> box and - <dig> box sequences were predicted .

pseudogenes
pseudogenes in bacteria genomes are non-functional copies of gene fragments usually created by random mutations and chance events  <cit> . although pseudogenes are usually non-functional, it has been reported that quite a few of them can still go through the transcription process  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> out of the  <dig> pseudogenes in c. beijerinckii  <dig> genome were found to have significant transcriptional activities over the course of fermentation . however, although globally the  <dig> pseudogenes comprise about  <dig> % of the predicted cds of the genome, only <  <dig> % of all the rna-seq reads mapped to these genes, indicating a significantly lower transcriptional activity when compared to the regular protein coding genes. in addition, six pseudogenes were found to be completely silent throughout the fermentation process . this is overrepresented among the silent genes when compared to the protein-coding genes based on a fisher's exact test .

when pseudogenes share high sequence identity with other functional genes in the genome, it is usually on one hand very difficult to design probes to detect the transcription of pseudogenes with traditional methods, and on the other pseudogenes can lead to amplification bias during genetic studies of the functional genes with high sequence identity to pseudogenes  <cit> . apparently such problems can be avoided with rna-seq method, which is one of the unprecedented advantages of rna-seq technique.

for summarization and easy reference to the readers, a table  summarizing the various supplementary information provided by rna-seq study to the current genome annotation was listed in the supplemental materials.

end-point rt-pcr
end-point rt-pcr was used to validate the operon structure results obtained from rna-seq analysis  <cit> . one gene pair that is highly likely to be co-operonic with an intergenic distance of  <dig> bp was chosen as a positive control . ten other gene pairs with long intergenic distances  where there were high transcription levels were chosen. all the operon structures determined by sequence data in the chosen gene pairs were confirmed by end-point rt-pcr results, indicating that rna-seq is a valid approach for operon structure identification . among them, the ptb-buk operon and the linkage between cbei_ <dig> and cbei_ <dig>  as discussed above were also confirmed.

correlations of rna-seq data with microarray and qrt-pcr data
the rna-seq data obtained in this study were compared to the results obtained previously using a 500-gene set dna microarray  <cit> . a small number of genes that did not allow for unambiguous mapping in rna-seq analysis were not included in the comparison. a good correlation was observed between the normalized coverage depth for sample  <dig>  and the raw microarray fluorescence intensities for an equivalent sample  . specifically, the gene expression patterns of glycolytic genes cbei_0597- <dig> and sporulation genes cbei_2069- <dig> from samples  <dig>  and  <dig>  measured by sequencing data were compared. similar differential expression patterns by microarray data from equivalent samples  were observed . although only a limited number of genes were compared, the good correlation between two methods further demonstrated the effectiveness of rna-seq approach. an additional advantage of rna-seq is that the sequence data can measure expression levels for every gene without bias caused by sequence-specific differences in hybridization efficiency in microarray-based methods  <cit> , and sequence data allow one to measure gene expression more accurately with a much higher dynamic range as indicated in this study  and other references  <cit> .

the expression measurement with rna-seq data was further validated using real time quantitative reverse transcription pcr . twenty-five genes were selected for the test . a high degree of correlation  between the threshold value  and the log2-tranformation of rpkm was observed .

CONCLUSIONS
a single-nucleotide resolution analysis of the c. beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> transcriptome structure was conducted using high-throughput rna-seq technology. the transcription start sites and operon structures were identified throughout the genome. the structure of operons involved in metabolic pathways for acid and solvent production in c. beijerinckii  <dig> were confirmed. important operons related to chemotaxis/motility, transcriptional regulation, stress response and fatty acids biosynthesis along with others were defined. twenty previously non-annotated regions were discovered with significant transcriptional activities and  <dig> genes were identified whose translation start codons were likely mis-annotated. as a consequence, the accuracy of existing genome annotation was significantly enhanced. moreover,  <dig> silent genes and  <dig> putative housekeeping genes were identified based on normalized transcription measurement with the sequence data. more than 30% of the pseudogenes were observed to have significant transcriptional activities during the fermentation process. strong correlations exist between the expression values derived from rna-seq analysis and microarray data or qrt-pcr results. transcriptome structural profiling in this study provided important supplemental information on the accuracy of annotation of the c. beijerinckii genome.
