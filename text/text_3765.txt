BACKGROUND
while remaining infrequent in human beings, cutaneous mast cell tumours  are one of the most common tumours in dogs, accounting for about 6% of all tumours and 13% of all skin tumours of the dog  <cit> . thus, canine mcts have attracted increasing attention in recent years, as spontaneous models for studying mast cell neoplastic disorders and developing new targeted chemotherapeutic drugs  <cit> . the biological behaviour of canine mcts can vary widely and is often difficult to predict  <cit> . histological grading  <cit>  is widely used for prognosis analysis  <cit> , but its adequacy remains debatable  <cit> . according to the internationally adopted system, mcts are usually graded as well-differentiated , moderately differentiated  or poorly differentiated  tumours. other prognostic factors have recently been proposed, most notably proliferation markers such as ki <dig>  nuclear antigen labelling index and agnors mean counts  <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated both normal  and abnormal  cd <dig> immunoexpression patterns in canine mcts  <cit> . cd <dig> cytoplasmic expression patterns have been shown to correlate with reduced post-surgical survival  <cit> . together with it's ligand , also known as steel factor or kit ligand, cd <dig>  is a critical transmembrane receptor tyrosine kynase for a number of cell types, including some hematopoietic stem cells, mast cells, melanocytes, and germ cells. binding of scf by cd <dig> leads to receptor dimerization and activation of its tyrosine kynase activity  <cit> . a number of signal transduction pathways, such as the pi3-kinase and the ras/erk pathways have been implicated in mediating cd <dig> functions in mast cells, including cellular proliferation and differentiation, resistance to apoptosis, mobility and chemotaxis, adhesion to fibronectin and enhancement of serotonin and histamine release  <cit> . cd <dig> is encoded by the proto-oncogene c-kit  <cit> . point mutations of this gene have been associated with human mastocytosis  <cit>  and other malignancies  <cit>  while c-kit exon  <dig> deletions and duplications have been identified in canine mcts  <cit> . this work aims to study the role of cd <dig> in canine mcts by analysing the correlations between cd <dig> immunoexpression patterns, two proliferation markers , histological grading, and several pathological variables.

RESULTS
 <dig>  tumours presented a membrane-associated cd <dig> staining pattern , while  <dig>  showed focal cytoplasmic staining  and  <dig>  diffuse cytoplasmic staining . ki <dig> labelling index ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , while mean nuclear agnors counts ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . histologically,  <dig>  tumours were grade i,  <dig> tumours  were grade ii and  <dig> tumours  were grade iii. highly significant statistical correlations  were found between cd <dig> staining patterns and histological grade, presence of necrosis and mitotic index . however, no differences were observed between focal and diffuse staining patterns, concerning any of the variables studied. highly significant statistical correlations  were also established between ki <dig> labelling index and cd <dig> staining patterns, histological grade, mitotic index and presence of necrosis and ulceration  as well as between these variables and agnors counts . figure  <dig> shows a linear correlation between ki <dig> labelling index and mean agnor counts  and the distribution of cd <dig> staining patterns  according to these proliferation markers. agnors mean counts were significantly higher in mcts showing cytoplasmic cd <dig> expression . a significant correlation was found between cd <dig> cytoplasmic pattern and epidermal ulceration . no significant statistical correlation was established between any pathologic variables and the sex, age or breed of the animals, nor with the number  or location  of the lesions.

discussion
the predominance of the boxer breed among the animals studied reflects a well-known breed predisposition for canine mcts. however, no significant correlations were found between the breed of the animals and any other of the variables now studied, and the significance of breed regarding the biopathology of mcts remains unclear. the linear correlation observed between ki <dig> labelling index and mean agnor counts validates the results of each technique and allows for confirmation of differences in cellular proliferation by two independent methods. the ki <dig> labelling index increases in a step-wise way from histological grade i to iii, but there is considerable overlapping of both agnors and ki <dig> values between histological grades. results have highlighted a strong correlation between cytoplasmic  cd <dig> immunoexpression and increased cell proliferation and higher histological grade  when compared with the normal, membrane-associated expression pattern. two distinct patterns for cd <dig> cytoplasmic staining  have been described  <cit> . in this study, no significant differences were found between focal and diffuse cytoplasmic cd <dig> staining, concerning any of the variables studied. this suggests that focal and diffuse cytoplasmic staining may reflect similar cellular changes and, possibly, a progressive cytoplasmic accumulation of cd <dig>  additional studies are needed to elucidate the biopathologic relevance of these expression patterns as well as the corresponding underlying cellular mechanisms. c-kit mutations have been shown to induce ligand-independent  cd <dig> phosphorylation and activation in human neoplasms, both by impairing the regulatory functions of the juxtamembrane domain and by directly targeting the kinase domain  <cit> . such mutations are likely to be the cause of increased cell proliferation in mcts showing cytoplasmic cd <dig> expression. it is interesting to speculate that mutations causing constitutive cd <dig> phosphorylation may also collide with the intracellular traffic of cd <dig> and cause the molecule to accumulate in cellular organelles, such as the golgi apparatus or the endoplasmic reticulum. c-kit mutations have been shown to correlate with altered cd <dig> expression, though mutations weren't present in all mcts with aberrant cd <dig> expression  <cit> . by elucidating the precise cellular location of cytoplasmic cd <dig> accumulations, especially in those lesions presenting a "golgi-like" pattern, a deeper insight into the role of this molecule in tumorigenesis may perhaps be gained. results suggest that translocation of cd <dig> into the cytoplasm correlates with activation of cd117-mediated cell proliferation. although increased cell proliferation in itself is insufficient for neoplastic transformation, it may contribute to the malignant phenotype by increasing the risk of spontaneous mutations. some human neoplasms have been demonstrated to present an autocrine loop in which neoplastic cells express both scf and cd <dig>  <cit> , thus securing permanent growth stimulation. this hypothesis has not been investigated in the case of canine mcts and should be addressed in future studies. the correlation observed between tumoral necrosis and cytoplasmic cd <dig> expression  may reflect increased cellular proliferation, insufficiently accompanied by angiogenesis, as suggested by the correlation observed between necrosis and higher ki <dig> labelling index . on the other hand, the correlation between the cd <dig> cytoplasmic pattern and epidermal ulceration may be due to a cd117-mediated enhancement of histamine and serotonine release and consequent pruritus and self-induced trauma. cd <dig> might also be thought to play a role in tumoral progression, as suggested by the correlation of cytoplasmic cd <dig> staining and higher histological grade, by facilitating neoplastic cell mobility and binding of fibronectin. the tumoral growth pattern  and the clinical variables studied  have shown no correlations with any of the pathological variables studied. the available survival data doesn't allow for conclusions as to which of the factors now studied is more suitable for prognostic analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
cytoplasmic  expression of cd <dig> correlates with increased cellular proliferation, as assessed by both ki <dig> labelling index and by agnors mean counts. this is in accordance with the known functions of cd <dig> as a growth factor receptor and is probably associated with a c-kit mutation. moreover, cytoplasmic cd <dig> expression also correlates with increased histological grade, tumour necrosis and epidermal ulceration. no differences were observed between focal and diffuse cytoplasmic staining patterns, suggesting that these represent similar cellular changes, or perhaps a progressive process of cytoplasmic cd <dig> accumulation. our future aims are to look for possible mutations in the c-kit gene in canine mccs.
