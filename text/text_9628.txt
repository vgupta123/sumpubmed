BACKGROUND
in most eukaryotes, the sequences that regulate transcription integrate multiple signals, through the binding of different transcription factors, to modulate levels of gene expression. when bound to dna, transcription factors anchor the assembly of multiprotein complexes that influence the recruitment of rna polymerase. efficient assembly depends on optimally spaced protein-protein interactions among transcription factors and auxiliary proteins  <cit> . since transcription factors recognize specific sites on dna, the distance between these binding sites can influence how transcription factors interact with each other and other proteins. for example, overlapping sites may prevent two transcription factors from binding simultaneously, while sites too distant from each other may hinder bound transcription factors from recruiting necessary cofactors. furthermore, some distantly spaced sites can only properly interact when the dna between them is looped, a process influenced by the composition of the looped dna.

computational approaches take into account the multifactorial nature of transcriptional regulation when discovering transcription factor binding sequence motifs. several methods search for pairs of enriched sequences, while allowing either fixed or variable spacing between them  <cit> . other approaches start with binding specificities for pairs of known transcription factors, then assess whether the predicted occurrences of their binding sites are closely spaced  <cit> . notably, most of these methods assess the spacing between binding sites with arbitrary criteria, such as minimum and maximum distance thresholds between binding sites. however, the biological relevance and suitability of these thresholds has seldom been verified experimentally.

several mechanisms that govern transcription factor interactions have been previously described. transcription factors may bind cooperatively to adjacent sites in dna, thus increasing the stability of the ternary dna-protein complex. since this effect is mediated by direct protein-protein interactions, sites for cooperatively binding transcription factors are usually spaced within  <dig> bp . slight alterations in spacing between the binding sites can drastically reduce gene expression unless helical phasing is preserved. computational analyses suggest that proper helical phasing between predicted binding sites may be a common property of transcriptional control regions  <cit> .

alternatively, transcription factors may bind to dna independently and cooperatively recruit a coactivator protein. co-recruitment of such activators is analogous to an "and gate" in logic. coincident binding of two proteins increases the fidelity and specificity of signal detection  <cit> . the network of transcription factors that regulates sulfur gene derepression in yeast provides a model system to dissect the promoter architecture requirements for coactivator recruitment. among these transcription factors, only the coactivator met <dig> contains a strong activation domain. however, met <dig> does not bind to dna directly, but is recruited in sulfur limitation conditions by cbf <dig> and met <dig> to the met <dig> promoter, as well as by met <dig> and met31/ <dig> on regions from the met <dig> and met <dig> promoters  <cit> . in addition, yeast two-hybrid assays with met <dig> truncation mutants revealed distinct regions that mediate interaction with cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig>  <cit> . taken together, these studies suggest a model by which the coactivator met <dig> is coordinately recruited by the transcription factors cbf <dig>  met <dig> and met31/ <dig> to the promoters of sulfur utilization genes . nevertheless, the effects of distance constraints and sequence context between cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> binding sites have not been characterized.

we use the term promoter architecture to refer to distance constraints and sequence context effects that govern interactions among transcription factor binding sites. our goal is to understand how promoter architectures differ for transcription factors that participate in coactivator recruitment, versus those that bind cooperatively. in this work, we developed a synthetic promoter assay to characterize how various distances between cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> binding sites influenced gene expression in response to methionine starvation. the relative order of binding sites affected reporter gene expression. we discovered that distance constraints on coactivator recruitment were more flexible than those for cooperatively binding transcription factors. distances from  <dig> to  <dig> bp between binding sites could support efficient recruitment of met <dig>  with only slight modulation by helical phasing. intriguingly, we found that certain sequence contexts between the binding sites abolished gene expression. finally, we noted that the probability of coactivator recruitment could be affected by the bendability of the spacer sequence between transcription factor binding sites.

RESULTS
annotated promoters of sulfur-regulated genes contain closely spaced binding sites
we first surveyed the promoter architectures of  <dig> annotated genes in s. cerevisiae that were co-expressed under sulfur-limiting conditions  <cit> . all of these promoters contained cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> binding sites with perfectly identical sequences among at least  <dig> of  <dig> closely-related yeast species . we assessed binding site conservation based on identity within a multiple sequence alignment, but not the distances between the sites. due to the small sample size, we did not distinguish between the possible relative orientations of the binding sites. notably, each sulfur-regulated promoter included a cbf <dig> binding site upstream of a met31/ <dig> binding site. these conserved binding sites could occur in either forward or reverse orientation.

in each promoter, we searched for the cbf <dig> binding site upstream of the met31/ <dig> binding site that yielded the smallest distance between them in s. cerevisiae. a histogram of these smallest distances showed a peak between  <dig> and  <dig> bp . this peak suggested an optimal distance between the transcription factors was necessary for efficient met <dig> recruitment. when investigating whether the distances between the closest pairs of binding site were helically phased, we could not detect an enrichment of distances on a certain face of dna . finally, the vast majority of annotated promoters contained met31/ <dig> binding sites within  <dig> to  <dig> bp upstream of the translation start site .

cbf <dig> binding sites are required upstream of met31/ <dig> binding sites
a larger collection of sulfur-regulated promoters would provide more statistical power to define key components of promoter architecture. to explore sequence space more diverse than that found in the yeast genome, we developed a synthetic genetic approach to select for sulfur-regulated promoters from a plasmid library. we engineered a single-copy plasmid that fused a minimal promoter upstream of the his <dig> reporter gene . to test their effects on transcription levels, different promoter architectures were embedded in the context of the minimal promoter from the s. cerevisiae mel <dig> gene  <cit> . this promoter was chosen for its low background expression, compared to promoters derived from the s. cerevisiae cyc <dig> gene. promoter architectures with combinations of regulatory sequences that supported sufficient expression of the his <dig> reporter gene enabled the parental yeast strain by <dig> to grow in media lacking histidine. in addition, semiquantitative measurements of his <dig> expression can be assayed by titration with 3-amino- <dig> ,4-triazole , a competitive inhibitor of the his <dig> gene product  <cit> . faster growth rates in the presence of higher concentrations of 3-at correspond to higher expression levels of the his <dig> gene.

we sought to define the minimal regulatory information that was sufficient to induce reporter gene expression in response to sulfur limitation. as a negative control, none of the synthetic promoters were able to induce enough his <dig> expression in a repressive concentration of methionine to support growth on a low level  of 3-at . in addition, neither the minimal promoter alone nor a single met31/ <dig> binding site could support growth in the absence of methionine with  <dig> mm 3-at. a single cbf <dig> binding site supported weak growth on  <dig> mm 3-at. in the wild-type met <dig> promoter, a cbf <dig> binding site was found  <dig> bp upstream from a met31/ <dig> binding site, as measured by center-to-center distance. two cbf <dig> binding sites placed at the same distance showed moderate his <dig> expression. however, two met31/ <dig> binding sites were unable to support growth. a promoter with a cbf <dig> binding site upstream of a met31/ <dig> binding site showed the highest level of his <dig> expression. in contrast, a promoter with the met31/ <dig> binding site found upstream of the cbf <dig> binding site was unable to support growth on  <dig> mm 3-at.

we compared these results obtained from a minimal promoter system to the average effects of promoter architecture in endogenous yeast genes. for each gene, we estimated the average number of mrna copies per cell by multiplying the basal transcript levels in rich growth media and the average ratio of gene expression change from published microarray studies of sulfur limitation conditions  <cit> . we then averaged these inferred absolute transcript levels for sets of genes whose promoters shared combinations of cbf <dig> or met31/ <dig> binding sites . the presence of cbf <dig> binding sites or met31/ <dig> binding sites was associated with a significant increase in inferred transcript levels compared to the rest of the genome. however, two cbf <dig> or two met31/ <dig> binding sites did not contribute to higher transcript levels. genes whose promoters shared a cbf <dig> binding site upstream of a met31/ <dig> binding site showed significantly higher transcript levels compared to genes with only a single cbf <dig> binding site. in contrast, the opposite order of binding sites was not associated with a significant increase in transcript levels. thus, the constraint on the order of binding sites was consistent with computational predictions of the regulatory effects for various promoter architectures.

high cooperativity between cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> binding sites spaced at least  <dig> bp apart
we predicted that efficient recruitment of met <dig> to the promoters of sulfur utilization genes should depend on the spacing between cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> binding sites. to investigate the effect of varied spacing on reporter gene activation, we constructed a set of promoter libraries that differed by 2-bp increments from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp, as well as 5-bp increments from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. each promoter library had a fixed size but degenerate nucleotide sequences between the cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> binding sites. the binding sites were flanked by  <dig> bp of sequence from the met <dig> promoter of s. bayanus, which lacks an adjacent gcn <dig> site.

by pooling hundreds of yeast transformants for each library, we reasoned that the contribution of nucleotide composition on met <dig> recruitment and subsequent gene activation would be averaged out. growth rates for each promoter library thus represent the aggregate effect of a certain distance on reporter gene expression. at several steps in the procedure, we took care to reduce the potential of selecting only the fastest-growing strains from each pool. first, we picked transformants of similar colony size. second, we amplified these pools overnight in dropout leucine media, which ensured that the plasmids were retained but did not select for levels of promoter expression. third, we measured growth rates for  <dig> hours after promoter induction and selection with 3-at, which corresponded to fewer than  <dig>  doubling times. finally, we verified the complexity of the library pools by isolating single colonies on non-selective growth plates and sequencing of the promoters in twenty different colonies.

pooled measurements of growth rates in sulfur limiting conditions determined that a minimum distance between cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> binding sites was required for the highest levels of gene expression . yeast harboring promoter libraries of varying sizes grew at similar rates in the absence of 3-at, indicating low levels of leaky transcription from the reporter construct. expression levels of the his <dig> reporter gene were titrated with the addition of  <dig> mm 3-at; similar results were obtained with different concentrations of 3-at . binding sites whose centers were spaced fewer than  <dig> bp apart promoted weak reporter gene expression. at these close distances, cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> may be sterically constrained from assembling a complex with met <dig>  reporter gene expression increases sharply as the distance between binding sites is increased from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. the highest levels of gene expression were observed for promoter libraries with binding sites spaced from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp apart, whereas helical phasing modulated the average growth rate by less than 20%.

sequence context between binding sites can inhibit gene activation
in addition to characterizing the aggregate effects of binding site spacing, we also examined the effects of different spacer sequences on reporter gene expression. we assayed the growth rates of individual yeast transformants on solid media containing  <dig> mm or  <dig> mm 3-at. each of the  <dig> to  <dig> transformants tested for a certain distance harbored a promoter with a different, random sequence between the cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> binding sites. we observed reproducible variability in growth rates among transformants with the same distance, but different spacer sequences, between cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> binding sites .

at each distance surveyed, a certain proportion of intervening sequences was compatible with reporter gene expression. since the pooled growth rates in liquid media were qualitatively similar over this distance range, we interpret these proportions as the probability that a random intervening sequence would support gene expression at a given distance. at a distance of  <dig> bp between sites, less than 30% of the sequences supported reporter gene expression. at distances between  <dig> and  <dig> bp, the proportion of transformants that showed moderate to high levels of growth on  <dig> mm 3-at varied from 38% to 60%. we observed a modest dependence of this proportion on helical phasing in the distance between binding sites.

to investigate what features of spacer sequences correlated with gene activation, we sequenced a sample of  <dig> promoters with distances of  <dig> bp, as well as  <dig> promoters with distances of  <dig> bp, between the cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> binding sites . promoters that supported gene expression  were similar in nucleotide composition to promoters that inhibited gene expression . since no trimers or tetramers were enriched in the positive or negative promoter sets, additional sequence-specific transcription factors probably did not contribute to gene expression. the most discriminating feature of negative promoters was a shared g or t immediately 5' to the met31/ <dig> binding site in  <dig> of  <dig> examples of distance  <dig>  as well as in all  <dig> examples of distance  <dig>  however, about half of the positive examples contained a g or t at that position, as expected.

we searched for additional residues that could discriminate among sequences that shared a g or t at the most 3' position of the spacer region using weblogo  <cit> . we compared sequence logos between the positive and negative promoters to calculate whether any nucleotides were enriched at particular positions in the spacer sequences . by focusing on the three most informative positions, we derived nucleotide combinations that predicted negative promoters with an overall sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 89% .

to test whether the a11-t <dig> nucleotide combination was sufficient to inhibit gene expression in spacer sequences of length  <dig>  we identified five promoters with a b11-t <dig> sequence combination and converted the nucleotide at position  <dig> to an adenine by site-directed mutagenesis. similar levels of reporter gene expression were driven by the original and mutant promoters, as assayed by serial dilutions on media containing  <dig> mm or  <dig> mm 3-at . thus, the effects of sequence context are not encoded by specific positions within the primary nucleotide sequence.

discussion
promoter architecture features of yeast sulfur utilization genes
we have developed a synthetic promoter assay to test how various features of promoter architecture affected his <dig> reporter gene expression in the context of a common minimal promoter. although this reporter gene assay is indirect, it has been successfully used to obtain semi-quantitative measurements of transcript levels  <cit> . we applied this system to characterize the collaborative recruitment of the coactivator met <dig> by the transcription factors cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> in response to methionine starvation. we found that the relative order of binding sites was crucial, since a cbf <dig> binding site was required upstream of a met31/ <dig> binding site for full gene expression. the influence of cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> binding site order on reporter gene expression implies that the spatial orientation of the met <dig> activation domain is required for the recruitment of downstream targets. two cbf <dig> binding sites could moderately increase reporter gene expression, yet the mechanism for this enhanced activation is unclear. synergistic activation of reporter gene expression occurred when cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> binding sites were spaced at least  <dig> bp apart. notably, the allowed distances for coactivator recruitment extend beyond the maximal range for cooperatively binding transcription factors. finally, we discovered that different sequence contexts between binding sites produced considerable heterogeneity of reporter gene expression, whereas helical phasing showed comparatively little effect.

although the transcription factors cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> lack canonical activation domains, they can serve as activators via collaborative recruitment of the coactivator met <dig> when they are jointly bound to the promoters of sulfur utilization genes . our genome-wide computational survey found that genes with single cbf <dig> or met31/ <dig> binding sites in their promoters were associated with significantly higher transcript levels, on average, when compared to the rest of the genome . however, the presence of two binding sites for the same transcription factor was not associated with a further increase in transcript levels on average. in contrast, we found that two cbf <dig> binding sites separated by  <dig> bp in a minimal promoter conferred increased reporter gene expression . this discrepancy could be explained by distinct distance constraints between two binding sites for the same transcription factor.

our data could not rule out the possibility that met31/ <dig> may serve as transcriptional repressors when bound to other promoters that lack cbf <dig> binding sites. we found that reporter gene expression in methionine starvation was lower for minimal promoters with one or two met31/ <dig> binding sites, compared to a minimal promoter with a cbf <dig> binding site alone . several models could explain how the binding of cbf <dig> could convert met31/ <dig> from a repressor to an activator. since the recruitment of the coactivator met <dig> requires interactions with both cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig>  met <dig> could displace a corepressor that may be constitutively bound to met31/ <dig>  in contrast, the binding of cbf <dig> could recruit enzymes that confer posttranslational modifications on met31/ <dig>  these modifications could induce a conformational change that relieves repressive activity of met31/ <dig>  kinetic analyses of transcription factor binding and subsequent recruitment of multiprotein regulatory complexes by chromatin immunoprecipitation could help distinguish between these models.

distinct promoter architecture requirements for different transcription factor combinations
the promoter architecture requirements for met <dig> coactivator recruitment differ considerably from previously characterized yeast promoters. for instance, the transcription factor rap <dig> can efficiently recruit gcr1/ <dig> only when their binding sites are found  <dig> or  <dig> bp apart  <cit> . notably, a distance of  <dig> bp that altered the helical phasing between these factors abolished gene activation. similarly, helical phasing between pho <dig> and swi <dig> binding sites modulates cooperative binding by almost three-fold  <cit> . as an extreme case, the insertion of a single base pair between the a <dig> and α <dig> binding sites abolishes cooperative binding  <cit> . in contrast with the above transcription factor pairs that bind cooperatively, levels of reporter gene activation were fairly consistent when cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> binding sites were spaced between  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp apart. the tolerance of met <dig> coactivator recruitment on a wide distance range contradicts the model that transcription factor interactions are predominantly determined by the precise spacing between their binding sites. intriguingly, the recruitment of met <dig> to a common minimal promoter seems to depend more on the sequence context between cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> binding sites than on the distance between them, provided that the minimum distance requirements were met. in light of these results, previous studies that varied distances between transcription factor binding sites should be reassessed, since they usually considered only a single sequence context for each distance.

the rather flexible distance constraints between cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> binding sites suggest that met <dig> recruitment may not require rigid, simultaneous protein-protein interactions among the bound transcription factors. taken together, these experiments suggest that the process of met <dig> recruitment differs considerably from the lock-and-key arrangements of bound transcription factors that govern the mammalian interferon beta enhanceosome  <cit> . instead, an intrinsic property of the intervening sequence context, such as dna bendability, may facilitate an induced fit between the bound transcription factors and met <dig>  whereas the distance between binding sites plays a diminished role in bridging bound transcription factors, intervening sequences with low intrinsic bendability could impair coactivator recruitment. thus, the key requirements of promoter architecture may rely heavily on the molecular mechanism of transcription factor interactions at a particular set of co-regulated promoters.

possible effects of sequence context between transcription factor binding sites
sequence context could alter met <dig> recruitment in several ways. first, residues adjacent to binding sites could reduce the binding affinity of cbf <dig> or met31/ <dig>  accordingly, we found that all spacer sequences that were incompatible with reporter gene expression contained a guanine or thymine immediately 5' to the met31/ <dig> binding site. secondly, the dna bendability of the spacer sequence could alter the conformation of cbf <dig>  which bends dna by approximately 68°  <cit> . conformational changes in cbf <dig> could affect its protein-protein interactions with met <dig> or met <dig>  thus reducing met <dig> recruitment. a requirement for dna bendability on protein-protein interactions has been recently shown for the transcription factor mcm <dig>  which bends dna by 66°, comparable to the bend angle induced by cbf <dig>  <cit> . a point mutant of mcm <dig> with a dna bending angle of 46° had a lower affinity for cooperative binding with fkh <dig> than a mutant with a dna bending angle of 49°, suggesting that a certain threshold of dna bending was required for ternary complex formation in vitro  <cit> . circular permutation assays on promoters with different sequence contexts could test whether the extent of bendability correlates with reporter gene activation. in addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies could identify the transcription factors whose binding in vivo is affected by sequence context.

whereas the influence of sequence context on gene activation has been widely reported e.g.,  <cit> , the key determinants of sequence context have been poorly defined. except for the residue adjacent to the met31/ <dig> binding site, we could not identify features of the primary nucleotide sequence that correlated with gene activation. previous studies have reported that protein-dna interactions can be affected by physicochemical properties of dna, such as twist  <cit> . although we assessed several dinucleotide parameters, we could not find any significant correlation between the average parameter value of a spacer sequence and reporter gene activation .

epigenetic effects could account for some of the observed variability in gene activation among promoters with different sequence contexts. by examining multiple independent serial dilutions for several promoter sequences , we believe that this variability is reproducible and not due to stochastic effects on individual clones. in order to sample a large number of promoter architectures, we assayed reporter gene expression from a single-copy plasmid, which yields over  <dig> -fold higher transformation efficiency than chromosomal integration. we have not explored how the flanking sequence composition of wild-type promoters may affect the basal or met4-induced nucleosomal accessibility of cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> binding sites in the genome. cbf <dig> can also modulate nucleosome positioning and recruit the isw <dig> chromatin remodeling complex  <cit> . thus, additional determinants of local sequence context that affect the binding or dna bending of cbf <dig> may influence met <dig> recruitment and gene activation in a chromosomal context.

implications for computational predictions of transcription factor interactions
the development of computational methods to predict the transcriptional output of an arbitrary regulatory sequence has attracted considerable interest, as reviewed in  <cit> . most computational approaches assess the enrichment of predicted binding sites within a large sequence region, while ignoring the spatial arrangement of the binding sites. moreover, only a handful of methods explicitly consider whether binding sites are more closely spaced than expected  <cit> . these methods typically specify minimum and maximum distance thresholds between which transcription factors are predicted to interact. whereas the use of thresholds roughly approximates the range of transcription factor interactions, our above experiments suggest two major improvements for more accurate predictions.

first, different mechanisms of transcription factor interactions may impose distinct distance constraints between their binding sites. we found that the minimum spacing between cbf <dig> and met <dig> binding sites was the key distance constraint on reporter gene activation. we interpret this minimum distance to be a consequence of the coactivator's role in bridging the bound transcription factors. various coactivators likely have different minimum distance requirements, based on their size and the relative locations of their interaction surfaces with dna-bound transcription factors. experimental studies on the promoter architecture requirements for other common coactivators should provide empirical distance thresholds that could improve the prediction accuracy of their regulated target genes.

in addition, the pronounced effects of sequence context on reporter gene activation suggest that highly accurate predictions of target gene regulation may not be easily extrapolated from targeted experimental studies. further investigations of promoter architecture may benefit from a framework that formalizes how enthalpy gains from protein-protein interactions are offset by the entropy loss of multiprotein complex formation. thermodynamic measurements on promoter variants with different spacing and sequence contexts between transcription factor binding sites could then be associated with changes in gene activation. such a theory on the energetics of multiprotein complex formation could provide the quantitative precision needed to predict how a particular transcriptional control region adopts a conformation that enables transcriptional activation.

CONCLUSIONS
the main goal of this work was to characterize the influence of various components of promoter architecture on transcription factor interactions. we found that the requirements for met <dig> coactivator recruitment were considerably more flexible than those for cooperatively binding transcription factors. the characteristic requirements of met <dig> recruitment included the precise order of cbf <dig> and met31/ <dig> binding sites, a large distance range between the binding sites that was insensitive to helical phasing, and the pronounced inhibitory effects of sequence context. given the modular design of our synthetic promoter system, our approach can be readily used to characterize the promoter architecture constraints between arbitrary combinations of yeast transcription factors.
