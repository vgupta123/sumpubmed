BACKGROUND
there is experimental evidence that formation of oxidants is regulated in cells by factors, affecting targets specifically  <cit> . different oxidative stress-inducing agents , which disturb intracellular oxidant concentrations specifically, influence segments of the genome differentially with almost no overlap in saccharomyces cerevisiae, when a genome-wide set of deletion strains was tested  <cit> . for example, respiration was shown to be important in h2o <dig> defense while the nadph-producing pentose phosphate pathway was menadione-responsive  <cit> .

oxidant levels are clearly influenced by the chemical structure of the agents used to trigger stress as well as the concentration and exposure time of the agents  <cit> . overdosing with reactants decreases specificity of treatments by increasing the number of affected oxidants and diminishing survival rates  <cit> .

the filamentous fungus aspergillus nidulans with whole genome sequence availability and extensive est collections is an excellent model to perform transcriptome analyses using est-based dna microarrays  <cit> . physiological parameters indicative of oxidative stress can also be measured with high reproducibility in a. nidulans  <cit> .

in this study, we assay physiologically well-defined oxidative stress-inducing systems to describe the global transcriptional changes observable in a. nidulans vegetative hyphae exposed to diamide, h2o <dig> and menadione. in addition, we demonstrate large gene groups responsive to changes in intracellular peroxide  and superoxide  levels or glutathione/glutathione disulfide  redox imbalance.

RESULTS
optimization of oxidative stress inducing conditions
for diamide, h2o <dig> and menadione treatments,  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  mm were selected, respectively, which were well below the "dosis lethalis minima"  determined in liquid a. nidulans cultures .

diamide at  <dig>  mm decreased gsh/gssg value without effecting intracellular o22- or o2•- levels . h2o <dig> and menadione increased intracellular o22- and o2•-levels, respectively, but also disturbed gsh/gssg redox balance at all concentrations tested. in addition, menadione added at all tested concentrations facilitated intracellular accumulation of o22- . increases in intracellular o22- levels induced by  <dig> mm h2o <dig> or  <dig>  mm menadione and decreases in gsh/gssg ratios when diamide, h2o <dig> or menadione was present were comparable to each other, respectively . the stress observed in diamide and h2o2-exposed cultures was pulse-like with a maximum intensity under  <dig> h exposure time and followed with full recovery . meanwhile, all stress-related physiological parameters tested changed steadily up to  <dig> h exposure time in menadione-treated cultures indicating accumulation of stress with no recovery.

short time  exposures to  <dig>  mm diamide increased the specific glutathione s-transferase  and catalase activities while superoxide dismutase  activity went up only after extended treatments . the specific sod, gst and catalase activities all responded to short  <dig>  mm menadione treatments  while  <dig> mm h2o <dig> triggered elevations only in catalase activity . after extended  incubation with h2o <dig>  the increase in sod and gst activities was significant at p <  <dig> % and p <  <dig> %, respectively .

similar to previous observations  <cit> ,  <dig>  mm diamide,  <dig> mm h2o <dig> and  <dig>  mm menadione did not influence cell survival rates significantly even after extended  treatment periods .

northern blot mrna accumulation analysis of selected genes expressed under various kinds of oxidative stress are shown in figure  <dig>  mnorthern = log <dig> values were calculated for each exposure time and each stress-inducing agent concentration tested. among the selected genes were: gsta  clearly up-regulated by diamide and menadione ; soda , which responded solely to menadione treatments . in addition, soda was down-regulated in control cultures after  <dig> h, which resulted in fluctuations in mnorthern = f functions when mycelia were exposed to diamide or h2o <dig> . expression of a ca2+-calmodulin-dependent serine-threonine-protein kinase homologue of schizosaccharomyces pombe  fluctuated in both stress-exposed and control cultures annulling each other when mnorthern = f were calculated after  <dig> h . transcription of sconc  and aoxa  was not effected by oxidative stress with mnorthern values around or between + <dig> and - <dig> .

gene activation or repression was dose-dependent when diamide and menadione concentrations were elevated from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm, respectively . when the concentration of h2o <dig> was elevated from  <dig> to  <dig> mm the mrna pools were degraded at  <dig> and  <dig> h exposure times while there was apparently no reduction in rrna levels at any exposure time tested .

evaluation of cdna microarray gene expression data
the log2-ratios of primary dna microarray readings for the gene probes  were normalized by loess intensity-dependent block-by-block normalization . the validity of the normalized dna microarray readings was estimated by correlating dna microarray m' and the appropriate mnorthern values calculated for northern blots . the correlation between gene expression data determined for the same set of randomly selected genes was r≈ <dig>  .

time-dependence of gene expression profiles from cdna microarrays showed that gsta was up-regulated by menadione and diamide while soda was only induced by menadione . the transcription of soda was not fluctuating in the presence of h2o <dig> and diamide, and all m' values were within  thresholds . the expression of ca2+-calmodulin-dependent serine-threonine-protein kinase was clearly fluctuating in microarray experiments with a maximum down-regulation at  <dig> h incubation and with a maximum induction of  <dig> h incubation under diamide and h2o2-treatments .

time-course of gene expression ratios, which was affected by stress-inducing agents more than two-fold, showed a maximum intensity response by  <dig> h exposure time . the expression ratio decreased sharply after  <dig> h exposure to diamide, decreased slightly and more slowly with h2o <dig> and remained high up to  <dig> h in the presence of menadione with a transient decrease at 3– <dig> h and a second peak at  <dig> h . with diamide and menadione, maximum  <dig> – <dig>  % of the gene probes responded with at least two-fold change in expression to stress, while this ratio was lower  for h2o <dig>  it is noteworthy that 4– <dig> % of the m' values were below or above the  thresholds, i.e. higher than 4-fold change recorded, when the ratio of affected gene probes was maximal for the agents .

in total,  <dig> gene probes  were affected by at least one of the stress-inducing compounds tested. prior to gene distribution analysis, recovery phase diamide  and h2o <dig>  data were disregarded, and only gene probes with at least  <dig> % of the m' values available for each stress-inducing agent  were processed further resulting in <dig> gene probes in total . half  of the selected gene probes responded to more than one agent,  <dig>  % were influenced by the agents equally – up- or down-regulated, while  <dig>  % of them were effected differentially. the number of gene probes affected by stress increased in the order of h2o <dig> , diamide  and menadione . similar tendencies were observed for gene probes affected only by one agent, h2o <dig> , diamide  and menadione . there were large sets of transcripts within the genome that were concomitantly responsive to several agents, e.g. diamide and h2o <dig> and menadione ; h2o <dig> and menadione ; diamide and h2o <dig> , and diamide and menadione  . after filtering out data where the agents caused more than two-fold but opposite changes in transcription the ratios of diamide-h2o2-menadione, h2o2-menadione, diamide-h2o <dig> and diamide-menadione responsive gene probes went down to  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively .

in order to perform gene enrichment calculations, the group of stress-responsive gene probes  was supplemented with a set of gene probes not influenced by oxidative stress but obeying the  <dig> % data availability filtering criteria . the combined set of gene probes  was used for functional data sorting and statistical analysis. stress-responsive gene probes were recorded in highest numbers in categories "transport, cytoskeleton, cell wall", "carbon metabolism" and "rna splicing and translation, protein maturation". the ratio of "function-unknown" genes was around  <dig> % independently of stress-inducing agent . the distribution of stress-responsive gene-probes among functional categories was approximately the same for each stress-inducing agent . when gsh/gssg , peroxide  and superoxide  responsive gene probes were selected, the distribution of gene probes among functional categories was distinct .

as shown in figure 7a and 7b and in additional file 4:supplement <dig> for the results of significant enrichment calculations, oxidative stress responsive gene probes were significantly overrepresented among diamide, h2o <dig> and menadione induced "secondary metabolism", diamide repressed "defense and stress proteins, degradation of xenobiotics" and "carbon metabolism", h2o <dig> repressed "rna splicing and translation, protein maturation" and "defense and stress proteins, degradation of xenobiotics" and menadione repressed "rna splicing and translation, protein maturation" gene probes. moreover, significant underrepresentation of stress-responsive gene probes was observed in categories such as "function-unknown" and "transport, cytoskeleton, cell wall" among menadione and h2o <dig> repressed gene probes, respectively. when enrichment calculations were performed on gsh/gssg, peroxide and superoxide responsive gene probes, a different enrichment profile was found with gene probes enriched in functional categories such as "rna splicing and translation, protein maturation" , "defense and stress proteins, degradation of xenobiotics" , "carbon metabolism" , "secondary metabolism"  and underrepresented among gsh/gssg repressed "function-unknown" genes.

finally, in addition to additional file 2:supplement <dig>  for the list of oxidative stress responsive gene probes, the full list of oxidative stress responsive gene probes is available at national center for biotechnology information  gene expression omnibus   <cit>  on platforms gpl <dig> and gpl <dig>  oxidative stress sensitive genes equally responsive to diamide, h2o <dig> and menadione treatments, i.e. the likely gsh/gssg-responsive genes, are briefly summarized in additional file 5:supplement <dig> for a selection of gsh/gssg responsive genes. a selection of genes considered as ros  responsive is given in additional file 6:supplement <dig> for a selection of ros responsive genes.

discussion
ros-generating chemicals are frequently used as agents to induce antioxidative defense systems and to study the mechanism of adaptation to oxidative stress  <cit> . although organisms might respond to naturally occurring oxidative stress conditions  <cit>  or endogenous ros  <cit>  in a quite different way these reactants are highly suitable to optimize experimental conditions and, hence, to improve the reproducibility of the size and intensity of stress sensed by cells  <cit> . without fine-tuning experimental conditions, e.g. optimizing the quantities of oxidant added, these chemicals have been shown to affect the concentrations of multiple types of ros and trigger concomitantly severe gsh/gssg redox imbalance  <cit> .

among the oxidative stress-inducing agents selected, diamide is a thiol-oxidizing agent resulting in fast oxidation of gsh to gssg resulting in gsh/gssg redox imbalance  <cit> , h2o <dig> increases intracellular peroxide  levels, which leads to the direct oxidation of the sulfur-containing amino acids and the generation of oh• radicals  <cit> , menadione generates superoxide anions  in a redox cycle, which destroys 4fe-4s proteins productng of oh•  <cit> . menadione may also affect gsh pool directly via a detoxification reaction catalyzed by gst  <cit> .

due to distinct mechanism of action, these chemicals provide the opportunity to map gsh/gssg, o22- and o2•--responsive sets of genes within the a. nidulans genome. in yeast, there is literature supporting the assumption that these agents influence different elements of the oxidative stress response  <cit> .

in the β-lactam producer p. chrysogenum, diamide, h2o <dig>  tert-butyl hydroperoxide and menadione were used to set up systems where intracellular gsh/gssg redox balance as well as intracellular peroxide and superoxide levels were altered selectively without influencing the other two physiological parameters  <cit> .

unfortunately, such clear-cut experimental conditions could only be set up using diamide in a. nidulans, which, when employed in a concentration of  <dig>  mm, disturbed only gsh/gssg redox balances without increasing intracellular ros concentrations . h2o <dig> and menadione always affected the gsh/gssg redox state of the cells, and menadione also influenced intracellular peroxide levels in addition to superoxide concentrations . this can be explained with the 6-17-fold lower specific catalase activities detected in stress-exposed a. nidulans cells in comparison to p. chrysogenum cultures   <cit> . the relatively weak peroxide-decomposing capability of a. nidulans explains the disturbance of gsh/gssg redox balance with h2o <dig> and menadione, because gsh is also oxidized non-enzymatically by many ros including oh•, a free radical known to be generated under these treatments  <cit> .

because h2o <dig> and menadione influenced the gsh/gssg redox couple and intracellular ros levels in an inseparable manner  <dig>  mm and  <dig> mm concentrations were selected, respectively, for dna microarray experiments taking into consideration cell survival and gene expression data . the specific activities of selected antioxidative enzymes were increased  and cell survival rates were not affected significantly by them , and no deterioration of the mrna and rrna populations were observed under these conditions . stress-inducing agents employed in these selected concentrations triggered detectable transcriptional changes in cdna microarray experiments as visualized on northern blots .

similarly to p. chrysogenum  <cit> , there was a correlation between intracellular gsh/gssg values, ros levels and increase in specific antioxidative enzyme activities in a. nidulans . for example, diamide failed to induce sod activity  and h2o <dig> did not influence sod  and gst  activities after  <dig> h exposure . as shown in figure  <dig>  the selected stress-inducing agent concentrations also allowed us to record ros and gsh/gssg specific differences at the level of gene transcripts.

normalized dna microarray data correlated with transcriptional changes determined on northern blots . because the calculation of both m and mnorthern values included division of gene expression data recorded in stress-exposed cultures with their counterparts found in controls the non-stress-related incubation-time-dependent changes taking place in control cultures distorted these parameters and, hence, disturbed their correlation especially at longer incubation periods . m' = f functions for individual gene probes were fluctuating in many cases but these tendencies might represent either real fluctuations like in the case of the homologue of the ca2+-calmodulin-dependent serine-threonine-protein kinase  or virtual fluctuations – a result of non-stress-related changes in controls . taking into consideration the high frequency of fluctuating gene expression patterns we considered only transcriptional changes above or below the  m' thresholds as a function of incubation time during gene function analysis .

all three chemicals used to trigger oxidative stress induced a genome-wide transcriptional stress response, which reached its maximum at  <dig> h incubation time as indicated by the number of gene probes affected more than two-fold by oxidative stress . the induction of antioxidative enzymes by h2o <dig> is regarded in general faster than that triggered by menadione as exemplified by the transcriptional changes recorded for cu,zn-containing superoxide dismutase in the yeast s. pombe  <cit>  and for the soda gene in this study . in agreement with this, the kinetics of intracellular accumulation of ros and decrease in gsh/gssg redox ratio was slow although steady in the presence of  <dig>  mm menadione . nevertheless, up-regulation of gsta, which plays a predominant role in detoxification of menadione  <cit> , as early as  <dig> min  was indicative of an early influx of this agent into cells. menadione is also an effective arylating agent in addition to its redox-cycling behavior and, especially at high concentrations , it enhances membrane fluidity  <cit> . oxidative and non-oxidative cell injuries caused by menadione are likely to contribute to short-term but large-scale transcriptional response observed in menadione-treated cultures . the transient decrease in the ratio of stress-affected gene-probes at 3– <dig> h exposure times and the appearance of a second maximum at  <dig> h  may be indicative of a shift from a mixed oxidative/non-oxidative towards a pure oxidative stress response in the gene expression signature of menadione.

diamide, h2o <dig> and menadione all influenced large groups of genes within the genome with considerable overlap . the appearance of large groups of gene probes equally responsive to diamide, h2o <dig>  menadione , or to h2o <dig> and menadione but not to diamide  or solely responsive to menadione  highly supported the hypothesis that separate ros and gsh/gssg redox state regulated groups of genes are present in a genome. the ratios of o22--, o2•-- and gsh/gssg responsive genes were estimated at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively .

the ratio of o2•--responsive gene probes was likely overestimated to an unknown extent by counting genes that were induced or repressed exclusively by non-oxidative types of stress also triggered by  <dig>  mm menadione  <cit> . moreover, one must consider that the oxidative stress-inducing agents used in this study may also disturb physiological parameters other than o2•-, o22-, gsh and gssg concentrations, e.g. the production of lipid peroxides  <cit> , and these changes may also have significant impact on global gene expression patterns as indicated by the relatively high ratios of only h2o <dig> , only diamide , diamide and menadione and but not h2o <dig>  and h2o <dig> and diamide but not menadione responsive gene probes . in s. cerevisiae, cells exposed to the toxic lipid peroxidation product linoleic acid hydroperoxide , a distinct set of genes was stimulated that were not responsive to other oxidants or heat shock  <cit> . the frequent appearance of gene probes responding to different stress-inducing agents with a more than two-fold change in transcription but in the opposite way  may also be the consequence of the effects of either not-yet-identified physiological factors or non-systematic errors of dna microarray hybridizations. all these factors may further distort the ratios calculated for o22--, o2•-- and gsh/gssg-responsive gene probes as well.

gene probe distribution analysis  and significant enrichment calculations  indicated that the distribution of stress responsive gene probes between functional categories and their enrichment profiles were different and only partially overlapping when grouped according to their responsiveness to stress-inducing agents or to changes in physiological parameters. this finding indicates that genome-wide transcriptional changes should be analyzed by correlating them directly to changes in oxidative stress-response physiological parameters and not to the chemistry and concentration of oxidant used to trigger stress.

according to shafer and buettner  <cit> , the gsh/gssg redox couple plays a pivotal role in controlling thiol and disulfide nano-switches that move cells from proliferation, through various stages of differentiation and, when the redox environment of the cells cannot be maintained, towards apoptosis. in accordance with this, our observations reflect the distinguished role of the gsh/gssg redox state in genome-wide oxidative stress response . for example, many components of signal transduction pathways, including homologues of pbs <dig> like mapk kinase   <cit> , psk <dig> kinase  <cit> , important transcription factors , ubiquitin tagging, cell cycle regulators, translation machinery proteins, defense and stress proteins , transport proteins  as well as many enzymes of the primary  and secondary  metabolism, seemed to be responsive to gsh/gssg redox imbalances at the level of transcription .

the stress-activated protein kinase  signal transduction pathway  and the bzip transcriptional factor atf <dig> have been shown to play a pivotal role in the regulation of the core environmental stress response  in s. pombe, which is common to all stresses including oxidative stress  <cit> . the stress-responsive genes controlled by atf <dig> in s. pombe include e.g. gpx <dig> glutathione peroxidase   <cit> , tps <dig> trehalose-6-phosphate synthase   <cit>  and cta <dig> cation-transporting p-type atpase   <cit> , and atf <dig> itself is an induced cesr gene  <cit> . based on functional and sequence homologies as well as gene expression changes presented in additional file 5:supplement <dig> for a selection of gsh/gssg responsive genes, the existence of an oxidative stress responsive sapk-atfa regulatory pathway with a similar set of target genes is likely in a. nidulans as hypothesized by aguirre et al.  <cit> . but this pathway seems to be controlled primarily by changes in the gsh/gssg redox balance instead of ros  concentrations  <cit> .

the gsh/gssg-dependent down-regulation of ribosomal proteins located in the cytoplasm of oxidative stress-exposed a. nidulans cells  may result in a decrease in the rate of protein synthesis similar to loaooh-exposed s. cerevisiae cells  <cit> . genes encoding ribosomal proteins located in the mitochondria was induced  indicating an increased protein synthesis in these organelles.

gsh/gssg redox imbalances affect glycolysis at 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase  and fructose biphosphate aldolase , which may result in the intracellular accumulation of fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate. this glycolytic metabolite is known to protect cells by improving energy status and mitochondrial functions in mammals  <cit> . in accordance with the findings published by jayashree and subramanyam  <cit> , the synthesis of the mycotoxin sterigmatocystin  is regulated positively by oxidative stress .

large gene groups responsive to ros but not to changes in the gsh/gssg redox balance  indicated that gsh-independent stress-sensing regulatory network also operated in a. nidulans cells exposed to oxidative stress. o22- and o2•- species affected mainly negatively transport processes like nuclear export-import via the down-regulation of the ran/spi <dig> homologue  <cit>  and ntf <dig> nuclear transport factor  <dig>  <cit>  and the induction of the yeast gtr <dig> homologue, a negative regulator of the ran g protein cycle  <cit>  . ros also seem to influence signal transduction e.g. via. repression of the homologue of the cryphonectria parasitica cppk <dig> protein kinase  <cit> . at the level of transcription, cpca-jlba amino acid starvation-responsive transcription factors  <cit>  are likely to contribute substantially to the regulation of oxidative stress response against ros . opposite to gsh/gssg-dependent regulation , translation was hardly effected by ros but the degradation of abnormal or damaged proteins in mitochondria by lon protease  <cit>  was induced by superoxide. elements of sexual development and sporulation were found to be ros-responsive, including a homologue of the meiosis inducer kinase ime <dig>   <cit> , aspc septin, spoc1-c1c conidium-specific protein  <cit>  and a homologue of the cdc <dig> kinase  <cit>  . the down-regulation of the latter kinase together with a blockage in the nuclear export-import system  <cit>  and a superoxide-dependent repression of the bena hyphal tubulin gene  <cit>  may lead to a cell cycle arrest in oxidative stress. h2o <dig> and menadione have been reported to cause g <dig> and g <dig> phase cell cycle arrests in s. cerevisiae, respectively  <cit> , and several cell-cycle-regulated transcripts were also shown to be down-regulated in linoleic acid hydroperoxide-exposed s. cerevisiae cells  <cit> .

in addition to the harmful effects on living cells, there is a growing appreciation of ros as important signal molecules in diverse cellular processes  <cit> . for example, ros  generated endogenously by nadph oxidases  have been demonstrated to play a role in macrophage  <cit>  and insulin  <cit>  signaling and regulation of vascular functions  <cit>  in mammals. nox-generated ros also regulates cell expansion in the plant arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . nox-generated ros have also been shown to regulate the sexual development in a. nidulans  <cit>  and podospora anserina  <cit>  as well as ascospore germination in p. anserina  <cit>  and n. crassa  <cit> , which clearly points that ros are likely involved in regulation of development and cell physiology in filamentous fungi as well.

CONCLUSIONS
large and separate ros  and gsh/gssg redox groups of genes are present in the a. nidulans genome. ros and gsh/gssg signaling seems to proceed independently of each other and may express their effects via different regulatory networks. unless the experimental conditions are optimized oxidative stress-inducing agents are likely to influence many physiological parameters and a concomitant activation of these separate signal transduction and regulatory networks can be predicted to reach an appropriate stress response at the level of transcriptome.

considering that diamide – gsh/gssg, h2o <dig> – o22- and menadione – o2•- responsive sets of genes were only partly overlapping and their significant enrichment profiles in functional categories, we recommend that oxidative-stress-triggered global transcriptional changes should be evaluated by correlating them to changes in oxidative-stress-responsive physiological parameters. correlating genome-wide transcriptional changes directly to the chemistry and concentrations of stress-inducing agents might lead to unsatisfactory conclusions unless the experimental conditions are thoroughly optimized and physiologically characterized.

dna microarray data presented in this study demonstrate changes in the transcriptome of oxidative stress-exposed a. nidulans cells. a more direct connection of genome-wide transcriptional changes to cellular physiology will be reached by a thorough and integrative analysis of stress-provoked changes observable at the levels of proteome and metabolome  <cit> , which is now in progress in our laboratory.
