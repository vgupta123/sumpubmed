BACKGROUND
the amyloid hypothesis states that alzheimer' disease  is caused by accumulation of toxic forms of the amyloid-β  peptide in the brain. aβ is a secreted peptide formed through consecutive proteolytic cleavages of the amyloid precursor protein  by the β-site app cleaving enzyme , which releases the n-terminal end of aβ, and γ-secretase, which releases a range of aβ c-terminal ends resulting in aβ peptides of typically 37- <dig> amino acids in length. the predominant form of aβ has  <dig> amino acid residues, and is denoted aβ <dig>  whereas the disease-associated aβ <dig> has two additional c-terminal residues  <cit> . on the basis of the biochemistry and pathology of aβ, many molecular targets have been proposed for inhibition of aβ accumulation, aggregation, or the toxic effects of aβ  <cit> . thus, aβ formation can be targeted directly via inhibition of bace <dig> or γ-secretase, or indirectly via inhibition of pathways that regulate the activity of these proteases. indirect regulation of bace <dig> involves a particularly wide range of mechanisms, recently reviewed in detail by hunt and turner  <cit> , and of potential pathological relevance because of the increased bace <dig> activity observed in the ad brain  <cit> . in brief, bace <dig> activity can be regulated through a variety of molecular targets involved in cytokine signaling  <cit> , hypoxia  <cit> , oxidative stress  <cit> , energy deprivation  <cit> , intracellular trafficking and maturation  <cit> , and glycosylphosphatidylinositol  anchor metabolism  <cit> . indirect targets have also been reported to regulate γ-secretase activity, including gsk3α  <cit> , rac <dig> gtpase  <cit> , casein kinase i  <cit>  and the g-protein coupled receptor gpr <dig>  <cit> . in addition, competition between the proteasome and γ-secretase for the c-terminal bace1-derived app processing intermediate can affect aβ levels in cell cultures  <cit> .

app itself is a direct target of small molecule modulators of aβ production  <cit> , and can be targeted indirectly via the prolyl isomerase pin <dig>  <cit> , sphingolipid metabolism  <cit> , reticulon/nogo proteins  <cit> , nogo-like lrrtm <dig>  <cit> , sorla  <cit>  and membrane microdomain switching  <cit> . app-mediated changes in aβ can also result from increased cleavage of the non-amyloidogenic α-site of app, thus competing with bace <dig> for the available app substrate, as reviewed by fahrenholz  <cit> . in brief, metalloproteases such as adam <dig>  <cit>  carry out α-site cleavage, which can be activated via multiple targets, including retinoic acid receptor  <cit>  liver-x-receptor, muscarinic acytylcholine receptor m <dig>  <cit> , g protein coupled receptor pac <dig>  <cit> , protein kinase c  <cit> , and low cholesterol  <cit> .

in addition to the regulation of aβ biosynthesis, aβ clearance is also regulated. clearance of aβ combines several mechanisms, including the lxr/abca1/apoe pathway  <cit> , degradation by endoproteases, reviewed by nalivaeva et al.  <dig>  <cit> , transport across the blood-brain barrier involving rage and lrp <dig> receptors, reviewed by deane and zlokovic  <cit> , lymphatic drainage, reviewed by weller et al.  <cit>  and microglial uptake of aβ  <cit> . indirect regulation of aβ clearance has also been reported, for example, modulation of neprilysin endoprotease by somatostatin receptor signaling  <cit> , and enhanced aβ proteolysis dependent on the apoe isoform  <cit> . in addition, resveratrol, a polyphenol in red wine, has been proposed to enhance aβ clearance via the proteasome  <cit> .

thus, it seems reasonable to anticipate numerous molecular targets capable of altering aβ levels, and that at least some of the targets should be relevant to aβ formation in the brain. the ideal target should have the potential for robust brain aβ-lowering without toxicity, and characteristics that facilitate development of inhibitors. we therefore took the approach of direct screening of brain aβ levels in novel mouse gene knock out  strains, an approach that has the dual advantages of providing evidence both for target effectiveness in aβ-lowering and for target safety. given that even optimized drug molecules may not be capable of 100% ablation of target function, we were most interested in finding ko strains with 50% or more reduction in brain aβ levels. a total of  <dig> viable homozygous gene ablations, representing  <dig> genes, were tested. surprisingly, none of these gene ablations exhibited robust decreases in aβ. in addition, we also evaluated gpr <dig> ko mice, recently proposed as an aβ target  <cit> , but found no overall effect on levels of brain aβ. in contrast, significantly increased brain aβ was detected in samples from two mouse ko strains corresponding to the proteins pigz and qprt, respectively involved in gpi anchor biosynthesis and the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation. thus, while the mouse ko screen did not directly identify novel targets for lowering aβ, it did suggest a limited number of biochemical pathways that might be significant for regulation of brain aβ levels in vivo, and that gene ablations causing a robust effect on brain aβ are rare.

RESULTS
a screen of mouse ko strains for altered brain aβ levels
mouse knock-out  strains were generated over a period of four years, and brain samples were collected and assayed during this time on an ongoing basis. figure  <dig> outlines the screening procedure. using four homozygous individuals per ko strain, brain aβ <dig> levels were determined using the left brain halves, and selected ko strains were chosen, based on potentially altered aβ <dig> levels, for further aβ determinations using the corresponding right brain halves. for ko strains in which aβ median values were consistently altered, the identity of the gene ko was then revealed in order to make a decision on further studies. a summary of the  <dig> genes by gene class is shown in table  <dig>  note that the sample is non-random and includes only strains in which the homozygous ko was viable.

the results of the primary aβ <dig> screen for  <dig> different ko strains are illustrated in figure  <dig>  the data were well approximated by a normal distribution  with standard deviation of 10%, indicating that a ko strain exhibiting a robust decrease of 50% would have been detected with 98% probability. the false positive error rate for observing a ko strain more than three standard deviations below the mean was estimated to be  <dig> %. in spite of the high probability of detecting aβ <dig> lowering, none of the novel  <dig> ko strains appeared to lower aβ <dig> by an amount that could be unequivocally distinguished from the general distribution. in contrast, samples from two ko strains exhibited approximately 100% increased aβ <dig>  which, at greater than  <dig> sd above baseline level, were far outside the general distribution . the false positive error rate associated with  <dig> sd is less than  <dig> e- <dig>  the genes corresponding to these two ko strains were pigz, encoding an enzyme required for 4th mannose side chain addition to the gpi protein anchor precursor, and qprt, encoding quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase, an enzyme of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation .

for  <dig> selected ko strains, particularly those exhibiting a median aβ value more than  <dig> sd below control values, repeat aβ <dig> assays, and in some cases aβ <dig> assays, were carried out using the right brain half . for most of these  <dig> ko strains, the small changes in average aβ <dig> levels were similar in magnitude to the assay variability, and it was therefore no surprise that very few of the results confirmed consistent changes of aβ <dig> in the right brain halves. consistent with this, there was no significant difference between the aβ values in the right and left brain halves.  nevertheless, the two ko strains that exhibited the greatest aβ40-lowering in both left and right brain assays were ube2r <dig> and adrm <dig>  both involved in the ubiquitin/proteasome system . in contrast, the robust average aβ <dig> increases exhibited in the pigz ko and qprt ko were readily confirmed in the right brain halves . changes in mean aβ <dig> were consistent with the changes in aβ <dig> for the pigz, qprt, ube2r <dig> and adrm <dig> ko mice . in the case of the adrm <dig> ko, all the aβ values were tightly grouped at about 30% lowering, whereas pigz, qprt and ube2r <dig> ko strains exhibited considerable individual variability in aβ levels. for pigz, the difference in aβ <dig> values between the left and right brain assays possibly reflected the different extraction procedures used; chaps extraction for the left and guanidine/spe extraction for the right half . however, this difference was not statistically significant .

ablation of gpr <dig> did not affect total brain aβ levels
deletion of the orphan g protein coupled receptor gpr <dig> has recently been reported to decrease hippocampal aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> in app transgenic mice by a mechanism that involves the regulation of γ-secretase  <cit> . we engineered a gpr <dig> ko strain and carried out aβ assays using extracts from sagittal brain halves . young mice showed no significant differences in brain aβ <dig>  aβ <dig> or aβ1-x levels between mice carrying the homozygous or heterozygous ko genotypes and homozygous wild type siblings . mice aged one year also showed no significant difference in brain aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> levels between the gpr <dig> ko and wild type siblings, although they exhibited a greater degree of individual variation in aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> levels that made it more difficult to detect small differences in the mean values . the results of significance testing for the different aβ species in young and old animals are shown in table  <dig> 

discussion
to identify novel molecular targets relevant to regulation of aβ levels in the brain, we screened viable mouse ko strains for decreased brain aβ <dig>  a total of  <dig> different gene ablations giving rise to viable homozygous mice were evaluated. two of the strains, pigz ko and qprt ko, showed an unequivocal increase of aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> in the screening samples, whereas changes in aβ were less obvious for the other ko strains. the two ko strains showing the lowest values of aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> in the screen, ube2r <dig> and adrm <dig>  were of uncertain significance given the small number of samples tested.

given the wide variety of mechanisms and proteins that have been reported to affect aβ, and the relatively large number of gene ko strains tested, it was surprising that we did not identify a single new gene ko strain that caused a robust  decrease in aβ. a combination of several reasons may account for this. first, the choice of gene ko strains entering the screen was based on the 'druggable genome', which mostly limited the ko strains to proteins in gene families known to interact with small molecules. second, the gene ko strains entering the screen were limited to those strains that resulted in viable homozygous adult mice. approximately one third of the gene ko constructs made were homozygous embryonic lethal, and were consequently not included in the brain aβ screen. therefore, effective aβ-lowering targets such as presenilin  <dig>  for which genetic ablation is deleterious, would not have been tested in this screen. third, functional redundancy, e.g. the genes encoding the aph1b and aph1c subunits of γ-secretase  <cit> , could have obscured any effects of single gene ablations. there is also the possibility of developmental compensation, in which alternative pathways functionally substitute for the missing gene, thus restoring aβ levels in the adult. fourth, inbred mice have been shown to express significantly different levels of brain aβ  <cit> , raising the possibility that genetic changes in these mice may have obscured the function of some genes . fifth, there is the possibility that some genes may affect aβ levels only in older mice, and therefore the role of these putative genes would not have been apparent at the age of three months when our mice were harvested. sixth the ability of the screen to detect changes in aβ was limited by the intrinsic variability in aβ combined with the small group size, which in most cases was equal to four homozygous ko animals. this limitation to four animals per ko strain was necessary because of the resource and time constraints of producing and maintaining multiple ko mouse colonies, and the use of most of the available ko mice for other phenotypic and biochemical tests not reported here. nevertheless the statistical power of the screen was favorable. based on the good fit of the data to the normal distribution , the false negative error rate  was found to be  <dig> % for detection of a ko strain with 50% lowering of aβ, and  <dig> e- <dig> for a ko strain with 85% lowering of aβ, as observed in the bace <dig> ko samples. thus, there was a high probability for detection of any ko strains robustly lowering aβ. in addition, the most practical aβ-lowering targets should have the potential to lower aβ by a robust and substantial amount, and thus, for the purpose of identifying the most practical targets, a low group size could be tolerated. the false positive error rate  for a ko strain more than  <dig> sd below the mean was  <dig> %, and for  <dig> sd above the mean was negligible at less than  <dig> e- <dig>  thus, the results for the two ko strains, ube2r <dig> and adrm <dig>  which exhibited the lowest brain aβ levels around three standard deviations below the mean, could have been due to chance, whereas the aβ increases in the pigz and qprt ko strains were very unlikely due to chance. finally, despite the possible limitations discussed above, it is hard to escape the conclusion that molecular targets capable of robust aβ lowering in the relevant context of brain are rare.

brain aβ <dig>  aβ <dig> and aβ1-x levels in gpr <dig> ko mice were evaluated more thoroughly by using a larger number of mice. no changes in brain aβ <dig>  aβ <dig> or aβ1-x were detected in sagittal brain halves from these mice. this contrasts with the results reported by thathiah et al.  <cit>  in which ca. 50% lowering of aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> was observed in app-transgenic gpr <dig> ko mice. there are two noteworthy experimental differences between the two studies, first, we assayed endogenous mouse aβ, not transgenic human aβ, and second, we used sagittal brain halves not hippocampal sections. unfortunately, our analysis did not extend to hippocampal sections, which constitutes only a small fraction of total brain. gpr <dig> is expressed at high levels in the cortex, which, like hippocampus, is relevant to ad. thus, evaluation of aβ in the hippocampus of non-app gpr <dig> ko and in the cortex and/or whole brain of app transgenic gpr <dig> ko would be interesting.

two gene ablations, corresponding to the pigz and qprt enzymes, exhibited significantly increased aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> in the screening samples. while further substantiation of the results for pigz and qprt using larger groups of homozygous ko mice is clearly desirable, plausible molecular mechanisms for increased aβ can be proposed. pigz, also known as smp <dig>  is a mannosyl transferase that catalyses addition of a fourth side chain mannose to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol  protein anchor precursor  <cit> . in cell cultures, gpi anchored proteins are necessary for aβ synthesis  <cit> , and targeting of an artificial bace1-gpi chimera to lipid rafts greatly increases aβ production  <cit> , although targeting of bace <dig> to lipid rafts is not necessary for aβ synthesis  <cit> . thus, in cell culture, a connection between gpi anchor metabolism and aβ levels is well established. an effect of pigz on brain aβ would extend these conclusions to a relevant organ in vivo, and further raises the possibility that the fourth mannose residue plays a specific role in aβ metabolism. qprt is the enzyme responsible for quinolinic acid turnover in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation  <cit> , and therefore ablation of this gene would be expected to increase quinolinic acid levels. increased quinolinic acid has been reported in ad brain  <cit> , and treatment of primary neuronal cultures with quinolinic acid has been reported to increase cell death and oxidative stress  <cit> . the association of oxidative stress with increased bace <dig> activity and aβ production has been widely substantiated in ad  <cit> , raising the possibility of a mechanistic connection between quinolinic acid and aβ through activation of bace <dig> by oxidative stress. in addition, quinolinic acid has been reported to increase app expression in rat brain, which could contribute to increased aβ production  <cit> .

the two ko strains for which the lowest values of aβ <dig> and aβ <dig>  were observed in our screen corresponded to the ups proteins adrm <dig> and ube2r <dig>  adrm <dig>  also known as hrpn <dig>  associates with the proteasome 19s regulatory particle, and is required for recruitment of the uch <dig> deubiquitinating enzyme to the proteasome  <cit> . ube2r <dig>  is a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme. decreased expression of several other ubiquitin conjugating enzymes has been reported to decrease aβ production in cell culture  <cit> . the ups has multiple potential roles in ad in addition to possible regulation of aβ levels, as recently reviewed in detail by upadhya and hegde  <cit> . possible mechanisms of proteasomal regulation of aβ include resveratrol-activated clearance of aβ  <cit> , and competition with γ-secretase for app processing  <cit> . thus, an intriguing possibility is that selective inhibition of specific sub-pathways of the ups might decrease brain aβ levels by both biosynthetic and clearance mechanisms. however, from a drug discovery perspective, this would carry the risk of further exacerbating the already defective proteasome activity prevalent in ad thought to result from the accumulation of toxic aβ and tau aggregates. furthermore, assuming that maximal inhibition of adrm <dig> or ube2r <dig> would elicit only a 30% decrease in brain aβ, even the effect of an inhibitor with ideal drug properties would be limited, and the expected small changes in aβ difficult to quantify.

CONCLUSIONS
gene ablations that have a robust effect on brain aβ appear to be rare, at a rate of approximately one in a thousand of the genes reported here. however, several pathways including gpi anchor metabolism, the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation, and the ups may be worth further evaluation for their roles in brain aβ regulation.
