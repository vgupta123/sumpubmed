BACKGROUND
basal transcription in archaea relies on a eukaryotes-like transcription machinery and promoter elements, whereas, transcriptional regulation is based on mainly bacteria-like transcriptional regulators . these regulators can act as repressors  <cit> , activators  or both . in the genome of the hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon pyrococcus furiosus a total number of  <dig> putative transcription factors  can be found, which represent about 4 % of all open reading frames   <cit> .  <dig> of these regulators belong to the tf family of trmb  proteins, which is mainly distributed within the euryarchaeota, but can be found across all archaeal divisions .

two of them, trmb and trmbl <dig> , play a crucial role in transcriptional control of genes involved in sugar transport and metabolism in p. furiosus . trmb mainly serves as transcriptional repressor of the operon encoding an abc transporter specific for trehalose and maltose  . the trmb binding site in the tm system overlaps tfb-recognition element  as well as tata-box and repression is mediated by impairing tata-binding protein  and transcription factor b  binding through steric hindrance  <cit> . in contrast, trmbl <dig> functions as a global regulator, which can act both as repressor and activator  <cit> . the thermococcales_glycolytic_motif  with the consensus sequence tatcac-n5-gtgata serves as palindromic dna recognition element for trmbl <dig> binding in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . targets of trmbl <dig> mediated regulation are genes encoding enzymes mainly involved in sugar uptake, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis. the dual functionality of trmbl <dig> relies on binding upstream or downstream of the promoter elements  <cit> . trmbl <dig> binding downstream of the tata-box inhibits rna polymerase  recruitment, whereas upstream binding activates transcription.

a detailed in vitro analysis of trmb and trmbl <dig> revealed crossregulation of both factors on some promoters, e.g. the tm and maltodextrin-specific-abc-transporter  system  <cit> . thus, we chose the chromatin immunoprecipitation  approach to decipher the specific genomic binding sites of trmb and trmbl <dig> in vivo. currently, only a few chip studies exploring archaeal species are available, mainly for the halophilic strain halobacterium salinarum-nrc <dig> and the hyperthermophilic crenarchaea sulfolobus solfataricus and sulfolobus acidocaldarius . most of these groups combined chip with whole genome microarray analysis  for the analysis of genome-wide protein occupancies. instead of using chip-chip, coupling of chip with high-througput sequencing  became a widely used approach for quantitative mapping of protein-dna binding events in a genome-wide manner in eukaryotic and bacterial systems  <cit> . recently, a workflow for genome-wide mapping of archaeal transcription factors chip-seq was reported  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to dissect the specific role of trmb and trmbl <dig> as transcriptional regulators of genes encoding enzymes involved in sugar uptake, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in a genome-wide manner in vivo. for this purpose a previously described chip protocol of our group for the hyperthermophilic archaeon p. furiosus was successfully improved for a chip-seq approach  <cit> . the identified binding sites in the p. furiosus genome under steady state glycolytic or gluconeogenic growth conditions exposed the function of trmbl <dig> as global regulator for sugar transport and metabolism and revealed novel and unexpected genes which are in addition under the transcriptional control of trmbl <dig> 

methods
strain and media
p. furiosus type strain dsm <dig> was obtained from the deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen  recently and after growth in sme complex media the strain was prepared for long time storage. cells were grown under anaerobic conditions in nutrient rich medium based on sme  <cit>  and supplemented with different organic substrates. complex sme media contained  <dig>  % starch,  <dig>  % peptone and  <dig>  % yeast extract. sme starch media contained  <dig>  % starch and  <dig>  % yeast extract. for sme pyruvate medium starch was replaced by 40 mm pyruvate and sme maltose contained 5 % maltose instead of starch. after inoculation with p. furiosus cells  cultivation was done at 95 °c overnight or until the appropriate cell density was reached.

plasmids and primers
all used plasmids and primers are shown in the supplement .

quantitative real-time pcr 
qpcr pimerpairs were designed using the primer <dig> software package and quality assessed . qpcr reactions were assembled as duplicates or triplicates in a total volume of 10 μl using the sensimix™ sybr® no-rox kit . primers were added to a final concentration of  <dig>  μm and the total volume of the dna samples in each reaction was 4 μl. no-template-control using eb buffer  was included for every primer pair. qpcr reactions were run on a rotorgene <dig> platform  using a three step protocol with an annealing temperature of 58 °c for every primer pair. data analysis was done using the corresponding rotorgene software package . only qpcr reactions with an efficiency of  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the corresponding primer pair were considered as determined by dilution serious. the specificity of the pcr products was verified by melt curve analysis. moreover, duplicate or triplicate reactions with a standard deviation  >  <dig>  quantification cycle  values were excluded from analysis.

copy number analysis
genomic dna was extracted from the following p. furiosus cell cultures: recultivation culture and from three biological replicates after two or five transfers in minimal sme starch, pyruvate or maltose  <cit> . copy number of the genes pf <dig> and pf <dig> was determined by qpcr and the relative quantification method  <cit>  using the gene pf <dig> as calibrator and the recultivation culture as reference for the cells grown under the three different conditions. sequences of corresponding primer pairs for pf <dig>  pf <dig> and pf <dig> are shown in additional file  <dig>  the results are represented as mean of the three biological replicates including sd.

southern blot analysis
southern blot analysis was done as described previously  <cit> . total genomic dna was digested with bamhi and smai. for probe labeling dna fragments were amplified by pcr. one probe specifically detects a 7 kb fragment harbouring the gene pf <dig> and the other a 3 kb fragment with the gene pf <dig>  molar ratios of both probes were adjusted to achieve comparable signal intensities.

antibody production and purification
polyclonal rabbit antibodies were produced by davids biotechnology  using recombinantly expressed and purified trmb and trmbl <dig> proteins  <cit> . the igg fraction of the polyclonal antibodies was purified using an immobilized protein g column  according to the manufactures instructions. antibody containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed in pbs overnight. the protein concentration was determined by bradford assay.

western blot analysis
the recombinantly expressed and purified proteins trmb, trmbl <dig> and trmbl <dig> were obtained as previously described  <cit> . cell extracts from p. furiosus were prepared from 20 ml cell cultures with a cell density of approximately 1x <dig> cells per ml. after harvesting cells were resuspended in pbs supplemented with protease inhibitor mix  and treated with glass beads using a fastprep <dig>  for cell lysis. after removal of cell debris by centrifugation the protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined by bradford assay. western blot experiments were done as described previously  <cit> .

chromatin immunoprecipitation
formaldehyde crosslinking was done according to liu et al.  <cit> . after recultivation in sme complex medium, p. furiosus cells were transferred to sme minimal medium supplemented with either starch  or sodium pyruvate  for adaptation to glycolytic or gluconeogenic growth conditions. moreover, p. furiosus cells grown under gluconeogenic conditions were transferred additional three times in sme minimal medium supplemented with pyruvate . these three cell cultures were used for cultivation of p. furiosus in 15 l bio-fermenters containing the appropriate medium  and gluconeogenic cultures  <dig> and  <dig> ). after the cells reached a cell density of  <dig> to  <dig> x <dig> cells/ml  fixation was done directly in the bio-fermenter at 95 °c with a final concentration of  <dig>  %  formaldehyde. after 20s the crosslinking reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 15 mm and the bio-fermenter was straight away cooled down to 20 °c for harvesting the crosslinked p. furiosus cells  <cit> .

formaldehyde-treated cells were disrupted by sonication using the branson sonifier  until an average fragment length of 250 bp to 500 bp was obtained . insoluble particles were removed by centrifugation. after freezing with liquid nitrogen the cell extracts were stored at −80 °c. for determination of dna concentration and fragment length  <dig> volume of cell extract was mixed with  <dig> volumes chip elution buffer  sds,  <dig>  mm egta) and incubated overnight at 65 °c. after rnase treatment dna was purified via the qiaquick pcr purification kit  and concentration was measured using the nanodrop .

for immunoprecipitation  5 μg of purified polyclonal antibodies raised against trmbl <dig> or phr was coupled to 50 μl dynabeads protein g for immunoprecipitation  according to the manufactures instructions. antibody coupled magnetic beads were resuspended in 500 μl p. furiosus cell extracts adjusted to a total dna amount of 15 μg in pbs and incubated overnight at 4 °c. immunoprecipitated complexes were washed in total five times with 500 μl of the following washing buffers: 2x low salt buffer, 1x high salt buffer, 1x licl detergent and 1x te  <cit> . elution from the beads was done in 100 μl chip elution buffer at 65 °c for 10 min. a second elution step was done without heating using 150 μl te buffer supplemented with  <dig>  %  sds and both eluates were combined. for the input sample 200 μl te supplemented with 1 %  sds was added to 50 μl not immunoprecipitated p. furiosus cell extract . eluted complexes and input samples were incubated overnight at 65 °c for reversal of the crosslink. after treatment with rnase a and proteinase k chip enriched and input dna was purified via the qiaquick pcr purification kit  and stored at −20 °c. for each culture  the immunoprecipitation step was repeated once .

library preparation and sequencing
library preparations were done according to the nebnext ®-chip-seq library prep reagent set for illumina protocol . for multiplex sample preparation the nebnext® multiplex oligos   were used and libraries were pcr amplified by the nebnext®high fidelity master mix . libraries were pooled in equimolar ratios and sequenced using the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform  . for further analysis only the demultiplexed and quality filtered reads  were used.

data processing and peak calling
reads were uploaded to the galaxy server platform  <cit>  and mapped to the p. furiosus dsm <dig> genome using bowtie <dig> with default settings  <cit> . aligned and unaligned reads were written to different files. peak calling was performed using model-based analysis for chip-seq )  <cit>  using default settings with following exceptions: effective genome size =  <dig> e + 6; band width = 300; model fold =  <cit> ; q-value cutoff =  <dig> e- <dig> and the maximum duplicate tags at the same position were adjusted to the minimal value sufficient for building the paired-peak model. following sample combinations were analysed: starch  <dig> ip <dig> versus starch  <dig> input, starch  <dig> ip <dig> versus starch  <dig> input, pyruvate  <dig> ip <dig> versus pyruvate  <dig> input, pyruvate  <dig> ip <dig> versus pyruvate  <dig> input, pyruvate  <dig> ip <dig> versus pyruvate  <dig> input and pyruvate  <dig> ip <dig> versus pyruvate  <dig> input. using these settings no significant peaks were detected in the samples starch  <dig> ip <dig> and  <dig>  moreover, from the peaks called in the samples pyruvate  <dig> ip <dig> and  <dig> and pyruvate  <dig> ip <dig> and  <dig> only those were considered for further analyses which were present in at least three from the four samples .

chip qpcr
the chip-enriched dna was also measured by qpcr using the % input method  <cit> . qpcr reactions were performed as described above. the corresponding primer pairs are shown in the additional file  <dig>  considering that only 10 % of the ip sample volume was used for the input sample % input was calculated by the formula:  <dig> *  <dig> ^  - cq ). % input values are shown as mean of at least three technical replicates of ip with sd.

de-novo motif discovery and promoter scan
the consensus tf binding site for each peak region was calculated as midpoint of the sites detected by macs <dig> in the different samples. the dna sequences surrounding these midpoints in the range of 350 bp downstream and upstream were used for de-novo motif discovery by meme  <cit>  using default settings with following exceptions: number of motifs = 5; minimum width =  <dig> and maximum width = 25). the identified motif displaying highest significance was further analysed by additional tools. analysis of motif enrichment was performed by ame   <cit> . additionally, motif occurrences in the p. furiosus dsm <dig> genome were searched by fimo  <cit>  using a p-value cut-off <  <dig> e- <dig>  analysis of centrally enrichment was done by centrimo   <cit> .

scanning for promoter occurrences in the detected chip-enriched was performed by fimo  <cit>  search using a p-value cut-off <  <dig> e- <dig>  the 14 bp consensus sequence of the bre- and tata-box  was loaded as position-frequency matrix reported by vandewerken et al.  <cit> . the scan was done in the  <dig> tgm containing peak regions surrounding the tf binding site midpoints in the range of 1000 bp upstream and downstream. the best confidence promoter match in each region was determined due the height of the fimo score, strand direction and the position of the putative corresponding gene  and/or previously reported rna transcript  <cit> . functional annotations and gene-annotation enrichment analyses were done using david bioinformatics resources   <cit>  and kegg  <cit> .

preparing of dna templates
first, regions of interest were obtained from genomic dna by pcr amplification with the phusion dna polymerase  using corresponding primers . for subcloning pcr products were ligated into smai and bamhi or hindii and bamhi double digested puc <dig> plasmids and transformed into chemically competent e. coli dh5α cells. correct plasmids were purified using the qiaprep plasmid isolation kit  and used as pcr template for generating dna templates used in in vitro assays. for emsa assays templates were pcr amplified using corresponding primers . one of the primers was labeled with 6-fluorescein . for all in vitro transcription assays dna templates were pcr amplified using standard m <dig> forward and reverse primers. for dnasei footprinting dna templates were pcr amplified using the corresponding primers .

dnase i footprint
 <dig> fmol template dna and  <dig>  μm trmbl <dig> were incubated under the conditions used for the gel shift assay.  <dig>  unit of dnase i was added for 1–6 min at 37 °c, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 95 % formamide. dna was ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 3 μl of formamide buffer. a dna sequencing ladder using the same primer was generated as a molecular mass standard. samples were loaded onto a  <dig>  % denaturing polyacrylamide gel and analysed using an abi prism  <dig> dna sequencer.

electrophoretic mobility shift assay 
 <dig> fmol labeled dna and various amounts of trmbl <dig> were assembled in a 15 μl reaction volume according to lee et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . after incubation at 70 °c for 15 min, protein-dna complexes were analysed using a non-denaturating 6 % polyacrylamide gel. dna fragments were visualized using a fluorimager.

in vitro transcription assay
assays were done as described previously  <cit> . reaction mixtures with a total volume of 25 μl were assembled using transcription buffer supplemented with  <dig> nm tbp,  <dig> nm tfb,  <dig> nm rnap,  <dig> fmol corresponding dna template and various amounts of trmbl <dig> as indicated. the final concentration of the ntp-mix in the reaction was 440 μm atp, 440 μm ctp, 440 μm gtp,  <dig>  μm utp and  utp at  <dig>  mbq . after incubation at 80 °c for 30 min the transcripts were separated on a denaturing 8 % polyacrylamide gel. transcription products were visualized using a fluorimager.

RESULTS
a computational analysis revealed a very similar organization of the two transcriptional regulators trmb and trmbl <dig>  both proteins contain in the n-terminal region a highly conserved helix-turn-helix motif as dna-binding-domain  and an effector-binding domain in the c-terminal region  <cit> . to exclude the possibility that the close relationship of both proteins lead to a potential cross-reactivity of the polyclonal antibodies raised against trmb  and trmbl <dig>  we started our analysis with western blot experiments.

the anti-trmbl <dig> igg showed a specific reaction for recombinant trmbl <dig>  and no cross-reactivity with the paralogs trmb and trmbl <dig> . moreover, in crude extracts from cells grown under glycolytic  or gluconeogenic  conditions one specific signal was detected . as the recombinant trmbl <dig> contains a his <dig> tag at the n-terminus, the electrophoretic mobility of the endogenous trmbl <dig> was slightly reduced. in contrast, the antibody raised against trmb showed a reaction with recombinant trmb and a cross-reaction with trmbl <dig> but not trmbl <dig> . in both crude extracts  no specific signal for trmb was detected . taken together, the anti-trmbl <dig> igg could be used for the chip experiments due to its high specificity, whereas the anti-trmb igg is not suitable due to the cross-reactivity to trmbl <dig> and due to the missing specific signals in the crude extracts.fig.  <dig> western blot analysis using anti-trmbl <dig> igg and anti-trmb igg. 100 ng each recombinant trmb , trmbl <dig>  and trmbl <dig>  were used and 20 μg crude extract obtained from p. furiosus cells, which were grown under gluconeogenic  or glycolytic  conditions. a using purified antibodies raised against recombinant trmbl <dig>  for detection. b using purified antibodies raised against recombinant trmb  for detection



trmbl <dig> specifically binds various genomic loci under gluconeogenic growth conditions in vivo
trmbl <dig> chip-seq experiments were performed using crude extracts from formaldehyde treated p. furiosus cells. under gluconeogenic conditions two biological samples  were analysed and one under glycolytic conditions . figure  <dig> shows an overview of the mapped sequences within the complete p. furiosus genome under both conditions. sequence analyses of all samples including inputs revealed two distinctive features:  <dig>  the sequences contained nearby no hits in the published genome sequence from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig>  this finding indicates that this part of the genome is deleted in the strain used for our experiments.  <dig>  in the glycolytic input and immunoprecipitation samples we observed a strong accumulation in the genomic coverage of mapped reads from position  <dig>  to  <dig> .fig.  <dig> trmbl <dig> binds to the genome under gluconeogenic growth conditions. trmbl <dig> chip-seq experiments with p. furiosus cells grown under gluconeogenic  and glycolytic  conditions were done and mapped trmbl <dig> immunoprecipitation  and input reads were visualized for the whole genome of p. furiosus using the igv genome browser  <cit> . prominent peaks found under gluconeogenic conditions are announced



applying macs <dig> we could identify in total  <dig> significantly enriched regions in the whole genome under gluconeogenic growth conditions . in contrast, under glycolytic conditions no significantly enriched sites were detected. this finding is consistent with earlier reports on trmbl <dig> binding properties in the presence of certain sugars in vitro and in vivo  <cit> .table  <dig> selected known, predicted and novel trmbl <dig> binding sites identified by chip-seq and corresponding genes

validation of identified trmbl <dig> binding sites in vivo by chip-qpcr
we used chip-qpcr assays as an alternative method to verify some of the sequence enrichments of the chip-seq experiments. the data were normalized using the percent input method and the promoter region of the glutamate dehydrogenase  gene  as a negative control . the chip-qpcr data confirmed the specific chip-seq enrichments of all analysed putative trmbl <dig> binding sites under gluconeogenic conditions . an antibody raised against the pyrococcus heatshock regulator  served as negative control for specific enrichment using the trmbl <dig> specific antibody for immunoprecipitation  <cit> . using anti-phr igg no enrichment of the promoter region of the phosphofructokinase  gene was detected under both growth conditions . in contrast, the previously identified phr binding site in the promoter region of the aaa + atpase gene  showed a strong chip-enrichment under both conditions. this demonstrates that the efficiency of formaldehyde crosslinking under both growth conditions was sufficient for successful chip experiments and that the absence of trmbl <dig> binding events under glycolytic growth conditions using chip is specific for trmbl <dig> fig.  <dig> chip-qpcr validation of selected trmbl <dig> binding sites identified by chip-seq. chip enrichment is presented as % input. the mean with sd of at least three replicates of ip is shown for all analysed genomic loci. a trmbl <dig> chip of cells grown under gluconeogenic condition . the genes pf <dig>  and pf <dig>  represent the negative controls for the anti-trmbl <dig> igg. b trmbl <dig> chip of cells grown under glycolytic growth condition . the genes pf <dig>  and pf <dig>  represent the negative controls for the anti-trmbl <dig> igg. c chip with a phr specific antibody using cells grown on pyruvate . the gene pf <dig>  is the positive control for the anti-phr igg, whereas the genes pf <dig>  and pf <dig>  are the negative controls for the anti-phr igg. d chip with a phr specific antibody using cells grown on starch . the gene pf <dig>  is the positive control for the anti-phr igg, whereas the genes pf <dig>  and pf <dig>  are the negative controls for the anti-phr igg



trmbl <dig> preferentially binds to tgm containing regions in the p. furiosus genome in vivo
previous studies showed that the tgm serves as palindromic dna recognition element for trmbl <dig> binding in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . thus, identified trmbl <dig> chip-enriched regions were analysed by the meme suite  <cit> . de-novo motif discovery revealed the presence of a motif  within 350 bps upstream and downstream in  <dig> of  <dig> trmbl <dig> binding sites identified by chip-seq . this motif is quite similar to the previously reported tgm regarding length and consensus sequence tatcac-n-gtgata  <cit> . moreover, it is relatively enriched in the  <dig> peak regions compared with shuffled sequences . additionally, scanning for this consensus signature throughout the whole p. furiosus genome identified in total  <dig> motif occurrences with a p-value less than 1e- <dig> . 57 % can be connected to  <dig> chip-enriched regions, whereas 43 % are associated with further  <dig> sites . this suggests that trmbl <dig> preferentially binds to tgm containing regions in the p. furiosus genome and may bind additional sites, which were not identified during our chip approach. furthermore, local motif enrichment analysis showed that the tgm motif is centrally enriched in 68 % of the detected binding sites . this indicates the high spatial resolution of the chip-seq approach, which was already described in previous reports  <cit> .fig.  <dig> trmbl <dig> preferentially binds to tgm containing regions in the p. furiosus genome. a sequence logo ; e-value =  <dig> e-024) of the tgm based on  <dig> trmbl <dig> binding sites identified by chip-seq and de-novo motif discovery using meme. b central motif enrichment of the tgm in the detected trmbl <dig> binding sites  analysed by centrimo



trmbl <dig> binds downstream and upstream of promoter elements in the p. furiosus genome in vivo
trmbl <dig> functions as transcriptional regulator which can act both as repressor and activator by binding downstream or upstream of the promoter elements  <cit> .  <dig> trmbl <dig> binding sites  are in close proximity to promoters  of transcription units , whereas six were found in transcribed regions . for one site in the transcribed region of the gene pf <dig> a strong promoter could be detected; however, no transcription unit could be identified. the tgm is mainly located directly downstream of the bre- and tata-box , which suggests transcriptional repression of these genes by inhibiting rnap recruitment. the seven remaining motif occurrences are located up to 156 bps upstream of the corresponding promoter elements. the expression of these transcription units is presumably activated by trmbl <dig> under gluconeogenic growth conditions. additionally, a comparison with results from a microarray analysis of p. furiosus grown on carbohydrates or peptides showed that  <dig> of  <dig> transcription units harbouring a tgm downstream of the corresponding promoters are downregulated under gluconeogenic growth conditions, whereas six of seven transcription units containing a tgm upstream of their promoters are upregulated under gluconeogenic growth conditions   <cit> . furthermore, trmbl <dig> may act for one single promoter region both as repressor and activator. on the one hand it inhibits reverse transcription of the operon transcribed from pf <dig> to pf <dig>  on the other hand it enhances forward transcription of the gene pf <dig>  a comparable transcriptional regulation mechanism was already shown for the archaeal sulphur response regulator surr, which controls hydrogen and elemental sulfur metabolism in p. furiosus  <cit> .

chip-seq experiments identified known and novel trmbl <dig> binding sites
binding  <dig> promoter regions in the p. furiosus genome extends the trmbl <dig> regulon to up to  <dig> genes . some of the corresponding genes displaying strong chip-enrichment signals in their upstream regions are labeled in fig.  <dig> . functional annotations of the  <dig> genes were done using kegg. gene-annotation enrichment analysis by david regarding the gene ontology  term biological process  revealed significant enrichment of  <dig> go terms , which are mainly related to sugar uptake, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis e.g. go <dig> , go <dig>  and go <dig> . all found enriched go terms are shown in additional file  <dig>  most important, the corresponding genes, which contain a trmbl <dig> binding site in their promoter region, were already studied by in vitro and/or in vivo analysis or predicted as target of trmbl <dig> mediated transcriptional control due to the presence of the tgm by in silico analysis   <cit> . this includes several genes encoding possible α-glucan hydrolyzing enzymes , which may function at various steps of starch degradation to glucose  <cit> . moreover, the chip-seq experiments confirmed that trmbl <dig> in vivo plays a role in the transcriptional control of the previously analysed md operon ;  <cit> . further glycolytic-specific genes regulated by trmbl <dig> encode for example the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ferredoxin oxidoreductase  and the adp-specific phosphofructokinase . in contrast, the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  seems to be the only gene which exhibits promoter bound trmbl <dig> under gluconeogenic conditions and which most likely plays a role in gluconeogenesis instead of glycolysis  <cit> .

in addition to the known binding sites, our chip-seq analysis also revealed  <dig> novel trmbl <dig> binding sites in the genome of p. furiosus . most of these newly identified genes seem to be not directly involved in the regulation of sugar uptake, glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. the finding that trmbl <dig> also binds the upstream regions of two predicted transcriptional regulators containing helix-turn-helix dna binding motifs  indicates that trmbl <dig> could also act as a more global regulator. additional genes harbouring a trmbl <dig> binding site in their upstream regions were the l-asparaginase  or a transmembrane transporter of the major facilitator superfamily  and various genes encoding hypothetical proteins with unknown function . one newly identified binding site under gluconeogenic conditions is located upstream of the pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase  δ subunit gene , which is part of a polycistronic operon transcribed from pf <dig> to pf <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, two novel trmbl <dig> sites were detected in the promoter regions of the genes encoding pyrolysin  and a membrane dipeptidase , which are participating in proteolysis.

validation of identified trmbl <dig> binding sites in vitro
our chip-seq approach revealed  <dig> trmbl <dig> binding sites in the genome of p. furiosus, which contain the tgm and which are located in close proximity to promoter regions. first of all, emsas were carried out to confirm specific binding of trmbl <dig> to  <dig> selected putative binding regions . these emsa experiments clearly demonstrated binding of trmbl <dig> to all tested templates . in contrast, no shift could be detected using the gdh promoter region as template, which contains no tgm . moreover, the chip-seq data indicates a close relationship between the identified binding positions and the presence of the tgm, which was already suggested by previous reports  <cit> . thus, dnase i footprinting experiments were performed to verify the function of the tgm as cis-regulatory dna element for trmbl <dig> binding. in all six analysed promoter regions the trmbl <dig> footprint protects the tgm sequence . additionally, the results of our chip-seq approach suggest that due to its high spatial resolution in combination with detailed motif analysis it enables predictions about the regulation mode of trmbl <dig> as transcriptional repressor  or activator . for verification of this assumption we used  <dig> templates in in vitro transcription experiments. in the presence of increasing concentrations of trmbl <dig> the transcription of all nine templates was repressed where the binding site is located downstream of the promoter . in contrast, the transcription of the two templates containing the tgm located upstream of the bre and tata-box were activated in the presence of trmbl <dig> . only for one template harbouring the tgm located upstream of the promoter no effect on transcription could be detected in the presence of trmbl <dig> . furthermore, in vitro transcription experiments using the upstream sequence of the por δ subunit  confirmed the presence of an additional promoter within the polycistronic operon of pf <dig> to pf <dig> . this internal promoter is repressed under gluconeogenic conditions due to binding of trmbl <dig>  a negative control template without tgm confirmed the requirement of the cis element for transcriptional regulation . in summary, the experimental confirmation in vitro revealed that our chip-seq approach allows a precise determination of the trmbl <dig> binding sites which enabled reliable predictions about the regulation mode of trmbl <dig> at almost all genes.fig.  <dig> trmbl <dig> dnase i footprint regions enclose the tgm. dnasei footprints were done in the presence  or absence  of trmbl <dig> using various identified binding sites. dna ladders and orientations of the used template strands  are marked by 5’ and 3’. trmbl <dig> footprint regions are written in bold letters and the tgms are highlighted as grey box. translational start sites, if present, are shown as black arrow and positions of the bres and tata-boxes are announced

as mentioned above mapping of the sequenced reads revealed a deletion of a 16 kb fragment from gene pf <dig> to pf <dig> . this fragment contains the tm system , which encodes for the trehalose/maltose-specific-abc transporter  <cit> . the transcriptional regulator trmb is also part of this operon and therefore it was not possible to detect the corresponding signal in western blot experiments using p. furiosus cell extracts . to exclude the possibility that the deletion of this fragment is only a characteristics of our strain we ordered a new one from the dsmz. the fragment is present in the new strain, but a southern blot analysis revealed that the fragment disappeared after a few transfers into fresh medium . the initial re-cultivation culture exhibited only a weak signal for the trmb fragment. this indicates that most of the genomes harbour already the deletion. to study the loss of this fragment in more detail a copy number analysis was performed after two and five transfers into different media . while under glycolytic conditions after two passages the fragment is nearby completely deleted , the copy number under gluconeogenic conditions varies between  <dig>  after two inoculations and  <dig>  after five inoculations. even growth on maltose could not prevent deletion of this fragment.fig.  <dig> deletion of a 16 kb fragment encoding the tm system and trmb. a southern blot analysis using bamhi and smai digested p. furiosus genomic dna. dna was isolated from cells after recultivation and adaption to glycolytic  or gluconeogenic  growth conditions. the result of two independent recultivations is shown. the probe, specific for pf <dig>  detects a 3 kb fragment, while the pf <dig> specific probe binds to a 7 kb fragment. b copy number analysis of the genes pf <dig> and pf <dig> in p. furiosus cells grown under the following conditions: glycolytic  or gluconeogenic . the gene pf <dig> was used as calibrator and the recultivation culture as reference. the mean of three biological replicates including sd is shown



discussion
initially, we planned to study the function of the two paralogous proteins trmb and trmbl <dig> from p. furiosus in a genome-wide manner by chip-seq in vivo, but the cross-reactivity of anti-trmb antibody with trmbl <dig> and the discovered 16 kb deletion including trmb in the p. furiosus genome inhibited this approach. the deleted fragment contains the complete tm operon, which also encodes for a trehalose/maltose-specific-abc-transporter. the deleted part belongs to one of six highly variable chromosomal regions, which were previously described in a population of pyrococcus isolates from vulcano island, italy  <cit> . furthermore, this 16 kb fragment is flanked by two insertion sequence  elements and proposed as an example for a recent transposon mediated gene transfer between p. furiosus and thermococcus litoralis  <cit> .

the analysis of a new type strain ordered from the dsmz indicated that this fragment was almost completely deleted after the first re-cultivation and even growth on maltose could not prevent the deletion of the fragment . from previous data it is known that growth on maltose also induces the expression of the md operon  <cit> . these authors assume that the used maltose in the medium is contaminated with maltotriose. we have used different amounts of maltose, but only a very high concentration  of maltose enabled the growth of p. furiosus. this finding also argues for a contamination with long-chained sugars and in consequence there is no possibility to exert selection pressure for keeping the tm operon. the reason why this fragment seems to become deleted even in the first re-activation culture is unknown.

focusing on chip-seq analysis of trmbl <dig> revealed  <dig> putative binding sites in the p. furiosus genome and the presence of the tgm could be shown for  <dig> identified regions. this also confirmed previous data suggesting this palindromic dna motif as exclusive binding site of this regulator  <cit> . six binding sites are located in transcribed regions far from any translational start site and/or promoter. the function of these sites regarding transcriptional control remained unclear. however, the identification of binding sites within transcribed regions was already reported for three archaeal tfs including trmb from h. salinarium nrc- <dig>  <cit> . in contrast,  <dig> identified binding sites are in close proximity of promoter regions of single genes and operons.

beside  <dig> well-known binding targets of trmbl <dig>  the chip-seq approach also enabled the identification of  <dig> new binding sites in the p. furiosus genome. this extends the trmbl <dig> regulon to up to  <dig> genes. the corresponding newly identified genes include a putative membrane transport protein of the mfs , which may play a role in sugar uptake. in addition, the identified binding sites upstream of pf <dig> and pf <dig> pointed to a higher-ranking influence of trmbl <dig> on transcriptional regulation: the first one is located within an operon transcribed from pf <dig> to pf <dig>  <cit> , but an additional separate transcript of pf <dig> to pf <dig> has been also suggested for this region  <cit> . pf <dig> to pf <dig> encode three subunits of the por and pf <dig> to pf <dig> encode three subunits of the ketoisovalerate ferredoxin oxidoreductase . both enzymes were heterotetramers and the missing γ-subunit is encoded by the first gene pf <dig> of the operon and is shared by both enzymes  <cit> . in vitro experiments confirmed that the binding of trmbl <dig> represses transcription starting from the promoter upstream of pf <dig> . under gluconeogenic growth conditions this would cause less conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coa and increase the amounts of available pyruvate for gluconeogenesis. it is interesting to note that the available microarray data neither from pyrococcus nor from thermococcus indicate this type of regulation  <cit> . additional promoters within archaeal operons and their implications for modulating different responses according to the environmental challenge has already been shown for h. salinarum nrc- <dig>  <cit> .

the second newly identified binding site is upstream of pf <dig>  the corresponding protein belongs to the padr-family which regulates phenolic acid decarboxylase in bacteria  <cit> . the function in archaea is unknown. it is interesting to note that transcriptional repression of pf <dig> by trmbl <dig> is conserved between p. furiosus and t. kodakarensis  <cit> . elucidation of the role of this regulator will be a straight forward task for the future to completely understand the role of trmbl <dig> as a superordinate player in gene regulation. this is also encouraged by the finding that trmbl <dig> activates expression of a second gene  containing a hth motif, which suggests a presumable function as transcriptional regulator.

previous in vitro studies indicated that the cellular concentration of trmbl <dig> is controlled by autoregulation  <cit> . but under the tested conditions we could not identify binding of trmbl <dig> upstream of its own gene. in contrast to t. kodakarensis the trmbl <dig> promoter has no tgm and we assume that binding of trmbl <dig> to the tgm and its function as transcriptional regulator in p. furiosus is mainly controlled by the presence of inducers and possible co-repressors. the promoter-dependent function of various inducers was already demonstrated by in vitro transcription experiments  <cit> .

the chip-seq data also revealed that some of the identified binding sites are located upstream of the promoter. a previous in vitro study already reported that binding of trmbl <dig> under gluconeogenic conditions upstream of the promoter leads to transcriptional activation  <cit> . thus, the identification of trmbl <dig> binding upstream of the promoter of the glycerin aldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase gene  and the l-asparaginase  and experimental confirmation is in perfect agreement with published data  <cit> . in both cases, the expression under gluconeogenic conditions is increased, but so far no mechanistic details about the activation mechanism are known. it is possible that trmbl <dig> acts in a similar mode as the transcriptional activators putative transcriptional regulator  <dig>  or tfb recruiting factor  <dig> . the first one facilitates the recruitment of tbp and the second one promotes tfb binding  <cit> .

unexpectedly, no binding of trmbl <dig> to the promoter region of the fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase gene  was detected in our study. previous results showed trmbl <dig> mediated activation of the transcription of this gene for p. furiosus and t. kodakarensis  <cit> . additionally, the fimo search for tgm occurrences in the whole p. furiosus genome confirmed the previously reported presence of a corresponding motif sequence in the pf <dig> promoter region   <cit> . however, there are several additional putative trmbl <dig> binding sites, which also appear to be unbound by trmbl <dig> in vivo using chip-seq. the binding of trmbl <dig> not only relies on the presence of the tgm. previous reports indicate that the function of trmbl <dig> is also impaired by the presence of certain sugars, which act as inducers or possible co-repressors . gene expression microarray analyses of p. furiosus cells, which were grown on a variety of glucans, revealed differential transcriptional responses to this different carbon sources  <cit> . this includes several genes , whose expression is regulated by trmbl <dig>  thus, we suggest that equivalent varying transcriptional responses can also be observed using pyruvate or peptides as carbon source. this may also explain the deviations between the chip-seq results and the microarray analysis of p. furiosus grown on carbohydrates or peptides  <cit> . for the microarray analysis p. furiosus was grown in the presence of s <dig> with peptides for gluconeogenic and with maltose for glycolytic conditions. for the chip-seq experiment p. furiosus was grown in the absence of s <dig> with sodium pyruvate for gluconeogenic and with starch for glycolytic conditions. furthermore, the methods are different: chip-seq gives a picture about trmbl <dig> molecules bound to dna and the microarray experiment provides information about quantified rna molecules. nevertheless, the chip-seq technique complements the microarray data and it increases the number of available global in vivo methods for the hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon p. furiosus to study gene regulatory networks in more detail. in the case of the trmbl <dig> network it enabled confirmation of known targets of trmbl <dig> mediated transcriptional control. the corresponding genes encode enzymes which participate in sugar uptake, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. furthermore, the identification of novel binding sites and the experimental verification clearly indicate that trmbl <dig> is also involved in regulation of genes encoding enzymes involved in additional cellular processes e.g. proteolysis, amino acid metabolism, transcriptional control or metabolic pathways. the trmbl1-regulated targets obtained from chip-seq are summarized in fig.  <dig>  these data indicate that trmbl <dig> is also a more global regulator similar to the function of trmb in h. salinarium nrc- <dig>  in this case trmb plays an important role for sensing disposability of a carbon source and controlling the appropriate transcriptional response by its own or together with additional regulators  <cit> .fig.  <dig> trmbl <dig> controls expression of genes involved in functionally-linked metabolic pathways by its own or in concert with secondary regulators. trmbl <dig> mediated repression or activation is depicted in red or blue. complete colouring indicates validation of repression or activation by cell-free transcription. banded colouring indicates suggested transcriptional effects. genes differentially expressed in a microarray analysis of p. furiosus grown on maltose or peptides are underlined  <cit> . gene products: pf <dig>  proposed α-glucosidase; pf <dig>  phosphoglucose isomerase; pf <dig>  proposed 4-α-glucanotransferase; pf <dig>  pyrolysin; pf <dig>  glycerinaldehyde 3-phosphate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase; pf <dig>  proposed extracellular α-amylase. pf <dig>  proposed extracellular cyclomaltodextrin glucano-transferase; pf <dig>  putative dna binding protein; pf <dig>  phosphoglucose mutase; pf <dig>  5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase; pf <dig>  membrane dipeptidase; pf0967-pf <dig>  pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase; pf1109/ <dig>  extracellular starch-binding protein; pf <dig>  proposed single-component transport protein; pf <dig>  putative padr-like regulator; pf <dig>  maltodextrin phosphorylase; pf <dig>  dihydroorotate dehydrogenase 1b; pf <dig>  phosphofructokinase; pf <dig> glycerinaldehyde 3-phosphate dehydroghenase; pf <dig>  triosephosphate isomerase; pf <dig>  amylo-pullulanase; pf1938-pf <dig> maltodextrin-specific abc transporter ; pf <dig> phosphoglycerate mutase; pf <dig>  fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate aldolase; pf <dig>  preprotein translocase subunit secg; pf <dig>  l-asparaginase. aa; amino acid



CONCLUSIONS
while chip-seq became a widely used approach to study genome-wide protein-dna interactions in bacterial and eukaryotic model organisms in vivo, it has been hitherto rarely applied in archaeal systems. our chip-seq analysis of trmb and trmbl <dig> increased the number of available in vivo approaches to analyze gene regulatory networks in p. furiosus, which represents beside t. kodakarensis one widely used archaeal model organism within the order thermococcales. in concert with the well-established in vitro assays of the p. furiosus transcription system, it represents a powerful tool, which can not only help to understand regulation of gene expression, but also to dissect the underlying mechanisms. this technique lead to two major findings: a, in the used p. furiosus strain `dsm3638´ a  <dig> kb fragment harboring the tm-system including trmb was deleted. thus, function of trmb in regulation of sugar metabolism could not be studied using this strain; b, in contrast, using chip-seq for mapping of trmbl <dig> binding sites in a genome wide manner for p. furiosus in vivo revealed an extended function of trmbl <dig> as global regulator. trmbl <dig> not only regulates genes involved in sugar metabolism, but it also controls transcription of genes involved in various additional metabolic pathways and biological processes as proteolysis or the amino acid metabolism
