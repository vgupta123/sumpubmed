BACKGROUND
the naturally occurring catecholamine dopamine  acts as a neurotransmitter and neurohormone in the central nervous system  of vertebrates and invertebrates. da is a precursor in the biochemical pathway for the production of melanin, and is required for invertebrate cuticle sclerotization . increasing evidence suggests that in insects, da and da receptors  are involved in the regulation of larval and pupal ecdysis, as well as in metamorphosis .

da metabolism has been studied extensively within many phylogenetic groups. the essential steps required for dopaminergic neurotransmission  are conserved between flies and humans. da synthesis is controlled by the rate-limiting enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase , which is encoded in drosophila by the pale locus . th converts tyrosine to the precursor molecule l-dopa, which is in turn converted to da by the enzyme dopa decarboxylase , encoded by the ddc gene . th and ddc are required for normal development in drosophila. null mutations targeting either biosynthetic enzyme result in late embryonic lethality  <cit> . more recently, elegant studies have shown that selective depletion of th in the nervous system is well tolerated by the developing fly, and that corresponding adults have normal lifespan, albeit display behavioral deficits   <cit> .

da exerts its function by activating g protein-coupled receptors . the fruit fly expresses both d1-like and d2-like da receptors, which are distinguished based on the ability of the receptor to couple to either stimulatory gαs  or inhibitory gαi/o  g proteins, which in turn activate downstream signaling mechanisms  <cit> . the fly d1-like receptors include dop1r <dig>   <cit>  and dop1r <dig>   <cit> , as well as the non-canonical dopecr  . dopecr has a unique in vitro pharmacological profile and can be activated either by dopamine or by the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone   <cit> . there is only one known drosophila d2-like receptor, dop2r , which has also been cloned and characterized  <cit> .

in addition to modulating a range of receptor-mediated physiologies in insects , da acts as a precursor of metabolites involved in cuticle melanization   <cit> , and is essential for the crosslinking of proteins and chitin during sclerotization  of the cuticle after eclosion . although the importance of da gpcrs as modifiers of adult fly behavior  is well-documented , the contribution of da receptors in the modulation of developmental processes has remained poorly defined. dopecr, which responds to both da and ecdysone, has been shown to regulate sugar sensing, male courtship, and pheromone perception in adult insects  <cit> . overexpression or a significant reduction in the expression of this receptor, however, does not compromise normal development  <cit> . the focus of our study is to define the role of the d1-like drosophila da receptor, dop1r <dig>  during development. this gpcr is well-conserved in arthropods, but exhibits limited homology with mammalian dopamine receptors  <cit> , suggesting a unique function for dop1r <dig> that is specific to invertebrate physiology.

we have used transgenic dop1r <dig> rna interference  drosophila, and characterized the effects of dop1r <dig> knockdown  using the gal4/uas-mediated system. we demonstrate that dop1r <dig> activity is critical during the third larval instar and pupal stages to ensure completion of development through adult emergence. our investigations of the tissue/cell types that underlie the observed dop1r2-mediated phenotypes suggest the involvement of dop1r <dig> receptors expressed in the salivary glands. the dop1r <dig> rnai-induced phenotypes observed in escaper adults are recapitulated in progeny exposed to a dop1r <dig> small molecule antagonist. we have identified a subset of genes that respond to dop1r <dig> kd, and are essential in development. our data provide the first indications that a peripheral dopamine receptor controls key developmental processes in drosophila.

RESULTS
dop1r <dig> rnai flies exhibit decreased dop1r <dig> transcript levels
crossing uas-dsdop1r <dig> rnai transgenic flies with the act5c-gal <dig> driver strain  results in progeny that ubiquitously express dop1r <dig> double-strand  rna . this leads to targeted degradation of the endogenous dop1r <dig> mrna  in all tissues in which the receptor is normally expressed . when primers were designed to amplify the endogenous dop1r <dig> message, without amplifying the rnai sequence, a significant and reproducible decrease in dop1r <dig> expression was observed, in dop1r <dig> rnai vs. control flies . when pcr primers were designed to amplify the dop1r <dig> rnai construct, a marked increase in transcript level was observed, confirming the expression of the rnai transgene . to assess whether expression of the dop1r <dig> rnai construct could trigger off-target effects, expression of a series of other biogenic amine receptors with closest homology , for which a slight increase was observed .fig.  <dig> dop1r <dig> cdna and a corresponding interference construct. a dop1r <dig> alternative transcripts dop1r2-ra, dop1r2-rb and dop1r2-rc are shown. top: coding sequences encompassing transmembrane domains  1- <dig> are shaded  and utr regions . bottom: knockdown region expanded, with tmds 5- <dig> indicated . b puas-dsdop1r <dig> interference construct, including the yeast upstream activator sequence , the dop1r <dig> inverted repeats and an sv <dig> polyadenylation site. c crosses and knockdown schematic, including dop1r <dig> inverted repeat

expression of dsdop1r <dig> rnai in the developing fly results in reduced viability, wing malformation and cuticle melanization phenotypes
dop1r <dig> rnai flies that are reared at 29 °c and ubiquitously express the dop1r <dig> rnai construct  develop normally throughout larval and early pupal stages, but fail to emerge from their pupal cases. when the flies are reared at a lower temperature , the gal4/uas-mediated rnai gene silencing is attenuated  <cit>  and ‘escaper’ adults emerge  . the escaper flies display other phenotypes with varying degrees of penetrance, including premature death, abnormal melanization , and/or failure to expand wings . as with reduced viability, males show a more pronounced phenotype, with a higher penetrance, than females . two independent act5c-gal <dig> driver lines  resulted in premature death, melanization and wing phenotypes in the progeny.fig.  <dig> ubiquitous knockdown of dop1r <dig> results in reduced adult emergence and wing and/or melanization phenotypes. a ubiquitous knockdown of dop1r <dig> at 29 °c results in 100 % of dop1r <dig> rnai flies  failing to emerge, compared to control flies . at 25 °c,  <dig> – <dig>  %  and  <dig> – <dig>  %  of dop1r <dig> rnai flies develop into adults . 25 °c n =  <dig> and 29 °c n =  <dig>  line 1:  <dig> replicates at 25 °c and  <dig> replicates 29 °c. line 2:  <dig> replicates at 25 °c and 29 °c. error bars indicate the standard error of the mean . b escaper flies may exhibit two other phenotypes: hypomelanization and curly wing. hypomelanization phenotype appears as reduced melanization of abdominal cuticle . c curly wing phenotype appears as bent/curved adult wing . driver stock: act5c-gal <dig> 



the lethal phenotype was recapitulated using two additional uas-dsdop1r <dig> lines  generated by the vienna drosophila rnai center . as observed with the draper/kopin lab rnai line, the male escapers  displayed the melanization phenotype . of note, in addition to the above lines, a deletion mutant of dop1r <dig>  is available that removes part of the 3’coding region of the gene . the resulting transcript would encode a receptor with a truncated intracellular c-terminus. corresponding flies are viable . notably, expression of a truncated gpcr in the context of a deletion that removes the last coding exons is possible, and was previously demonstrated for the drosophila serotonin receptor d5-th1a  <cit> .

analysis of the temporal requirements for dop1r <dig> expression suggests a role at the third larval instar and prepupal stage
we have utilized the well-established temperature effect on the gal4/uas system  to low  temperatures, and conversely, during different developmental stages  . regardless of which developmental stage, or direction , was selected to perform the transfer, flies that were kept at the high temperature throughout the third instar larval stage later arrested at the late pupal/pharate adult stage . these experiments indicate that expression of dop1r <dig> at the third instar larval stage is critical for survival of the developing progeny .fig.  <dig> down-regulation of dop1r <dig> around larval-to-pupal ecdysis leads to developmental arrest. a schematic of the temperature shift assay. b analysis of progeny that were switched from 29 °c  to 25 °c  on a defined day post egg laying. n =  <dig> , n =  <dig> . c analysis of progeny that were switched from 25 °c  to 29 °c  on a defined day post egg laying. n =  <dig> , n =  <dig> . transfer day and temperature shift, as well as corresponding developmental stage are indicated along the x-axis. each graph shows the percent of dop1r <dig> rnai   that emerge vs. controls . dop1r <dig> rnai flies reared at 29 °c fail to emerge as adults. flies transferred at 25 °c prior to the l <dig> larval/prepupal stage show higher eclosion. the difference in intervals between  and  reflects the temperature effect on the length of the life cycle . for each temperature shifts shown in  or , line  <dig> and line  <dig> were each assessed in triplicate. l: larval instar. error bars indicate the standard error of the mean 



a preliminary transcriptome analysis of dop1r <dig> rnai flies reveals up-regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase and ecdysone-related genes, as well as stress and immune response genes
affymetrix genechiprdrosophila genome array transcriptome expression analysis was performed in duplicate on early pupal stage dop1r <dig> rnai flies expressing the interference construct ubiquitously under restrictive conditions, and compared to that of corresponding control pupae. significance was assessed using genespring array analysis software . a total of  <dig> genes were identified as significantly differentially expressed following assessment of the two independent transcriptome analyses . among these, only eight genes were down-regulated, with a modest – <dig>  to – <dig>  fold-difference of expression compared to control flies. our focus was then shifted to  <dig> genes that were up-regulated with a fold-difference of  ≥  <dig>  . results include a 3-fold increase in expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase  in dop1r <dig> rnai vs. control flies. the affymetrix genechipr array data discussed in this publication have been deposited into the ncbi's gene expression omnibus  data repository  <cit>  and are accessible through the geo series accession number gse <dig> . flybase annotation  <cit>  and david bioinformatic analysis  <cit>  of the genes that are differentially expressed in response to dop1r <dig> kd revealed highly significant enrichment  of genes falling under selected ontology  term classes . the related genes that exhibited up-regulation include seven members in the late ecdysone-induced eig71e  gene family, which were up-regulated ~3-to 6-fold. the expression levels of multiple stress response genes , antimicrobial peptides/innate response genes  associated with gut immune responses  <cit> , and structural components of the cuticle  also increased in the dop1r <dig> rnai arrested flies compared to controls . a parallel analysis carried out using web-based gene set analysis toolkit   <cit>  revealed enrichment of genes falling under similar go term classes . the relatedness of these groupings is further supported by the many protein-protein interactions revealed using string analysis .fig.  <dig> transcriptome analysis of dop1r <dig> rnai arrested flies reveals up-regulation of families of related genes. results indicate an increase in the expression of  <dig> genes that were significantly up-regulated by ≥  <dig>  times in dop1r <dig> rnai flies , compared to control flies . the fold increase change in transcript level is indicated in parentheses. statistical significance was determined using a t-test on the average of two independent biological replicates, with a cutoff of p <  <dig> . families were assigned by david functional assignment and by manual annotation using flybase. driver stock: act5c-gal <dig> 



to further assess results from the microarray analysis, a subset of genes was randomly picked across the main go categories . these included hsp67bc, hsp70bc , cpr72eb, dro <dig>  dro <dig>  ceca <dig>  lysx , and edg <dig> . gene expression was assessed by rt-pcr in rna preparations isolated from independent biological replicates . this analysis confirmed increased transcript levels for all genes assessed . we also included rel in the rt-pcr validations  since the corresponding protein is a key effector in the imd pathway/gut immune response  <cit> . using rt-pcr, we observed a slight, but significant, increase in rel expression, in dsdop1r <dig> rnai  animals, as was observed by microarray analysis. quantitative pcr confirmed an increase  in th transcript levels, in dop1r <dig> rnai flies compared to controls .fig.  <dig> rt-pcr analysis confirms differential expression of genes in dop1r <dig> rnai flies. a transcript levels assessed by rt-pcr. rna obtained from dop1r <dig> rnai  and control pupae  was reverse transcribed, and pcr was performed in triplicate using primer sets corresponding to gene of interest or to act5c . b quantification of transcript levels. the average band intensity of dop1r <dig> rnai pcr products was normalized to control pcr products for act5c. error bars indicate the standard error of the mean , and significance was determined by comparing the difference in intensities of the rnai pcr bands versus the control pcr bands using an unpaired t-test. * p <  <dig> , ** p ≤  <dig> , *** p ≤  <dig> . driver stock: act5c-gal <dig>  



analysis of the tissue-specific requirements for dop1r <dig> expression suggests a role for receptor function in the salivary gland
to identify the tissue type that underlie the observed phenotypes, dop1r <dig> rnai expression was directed to specific tissues/cell types utilizing a series of gal <dig> drivers, and the effects of these genetic manipulations were monitored . it is well established that dop1r <dig> is abundantly expressed in the mushroom bodies   <cit> . however, elav-mediated pan-neuronal expression of the rnai construct , and tab2-mediated expression specifically targeted to the mb failed to compromise viability or to induce gross morphological abnormalities. the vast majority of drivers tested led to progeny with wild-type  phenotypes .table  <dig> effect of tissue-specific down-regulation of dop1r <dig>  a series of gal <dig> drivers was used to down-regulate dop1r <dig> expression in specific tissue/cell types. the lethality observed when down-regulating expression ubiquitously was recapitulated only when using the p{gawb} <dig>  driver, which expresses gal <dig> in the salivary glands and amnioserosa. semi-lethality was observed when using the p{gawb}17a and p{gawb}c <dig> drivers. all of the above mentioned drivers resulted in abnormal melanization and cuticle phenotypes

as a follow-up to this initial study, a more focused selection of candidate drivers was tested, based on the results of the transcriptome analysis. of particular interest was the eig <dig> defensin-like peptides, which are highly expressed in one tissue – the salivary gland – during the l <dig> wandering/white prepupal stage  <cit> . the p{gawb} <dig>  line , which expresses gal <dig> in the salivary glands, was obtained and utilized to generate salivary gland-expressing dop1r <dig> rnai flies. p{gawb} <dig> -directed dop1r <dig> knockdown resulted in developmental arrest of the progeny at the pupal/pharate adult stage , as seen with ubiquitous knockdown of dop1r <dig> . the p{gawb} <dig>  knockdown flies also exhibited poorly formed tergites and sternites, with line  <dig> displaying the most severe phenotype . because p{gawb} <dig>  also targets amnioserosal cells, which have a role in germ band retraction and dorsal closure in the developing embryo  <cit> , the fraction of dop1r <dig> rnai embryos hatching into first instar larvae was assessed and compared to that of corresponding control embryos. no evidence of embryonic lethality was found in rnai-expressing organisms . in subsequent work, we identified two additional larval salivary gland driver lines , which also targets glia and the proventriculus, and p{gawb}17a – fbst <dig>  which also targets female follicle cells, male accessory glands, testis sheath and cyst cells) that induce semi-lethality  in the corresponding dop1r <dig> rnai progeny . importantly, fbst <dig> and fbst <dig> resulted in progeny displaying wing and/or cuticle abnormalities , as was observed with ubiquitous kd of dop1r <dig>  for these drivers, the lethal and abnormal morphology phenotypes showed higher penetrance in male flies vs. female flies , as was observed with ubiquitous kd of dop1r <dig>  as indicated in table  <dig>  one tissue that is common to all three phenotype-positive gal <dig> drivers is the salivary gland. follow-up experiments confirmed gal4-driven gfp expression in the salivary glands of corresponding larvae , while other tissues displayed background fluorescence. a fourth salivary gland driver  did not result in reduced viability  in corresponding dop1r <dig> rnai progeny .fig.  <dig> dop1r <dig> down-regulation using the p{gawb} <dig>  driver leads to developmental arrest at the pharate adult stage. flies that escape lethality display a melanization phenotype. a expression of dop1r <dig> rnai construct under the control of the p{gawb} <dig>  driver , induces  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  lethality before eclosion. survival of rnai flies  is expressed as percent control progeny . n =  <dig> , n =  <dig> . crosses with line  <dig> were done in triplicate; line  <dig> was used as a confirmatory single experiment. error bars indicate the standard error of the mean . b images of pharate adults dissected out of the pupal case suggest a poorly formed abdomen  or incomplete cuticle formation . c analysis of progeny that were switched from 29 °c  to 25 °c  on a defined day post egg laying. transfer day and temperature shift, as well as corresponding developmental stage are defined along the x-axis. percent of dop1r <dig> rnai   that emerge vs. controls . dop1r <dig> rnai flies reared at 29 °c throughout development fail to emerge as adults, while those transferred to 25 °c prior to l <dig> larval/prepupal stage show higher eclosion. when flies are transferred between these two temperatures at different stages of development, the time course of lethality is revealed. n =  <dig>  driver stock: p{gawb} <dig> -gal <dig> . d reduced cuticle melanization  is observed in dsdop1r <dig> adult males that escape lethality at 25 °c. l: larval instar



since dop1r <dig> signals though the stimulatory g protein gαs, we performed a complementary genetic analysis inducing g protein rnai-mediated knockdown in vivo. two different uas-dsgαs  lines, as well as one uas-dsgαi  line, were used to generate progeny at 29 °c that express dsrna under control of the p{gawb} <dig> -gal <dig> driver. crossing either gαs rnai line with the p{gawb} <dig>  resulted in pharate adult progeny that failed to eclose, as compared to the corresponding controls. however, the gαi rnai progeny develop normally and emerge from their pupal cases as fully formed adults . these findings support the inferences that gαs signaling in the salivary glands is required for progression to the adult stage, and that the cognate gpcr play an essential role in this tissue/developmental process. in contrast, the inhibitory g protein gαi does not play a critical role for development in the salivary glands. while this finding does not exclusively pinpoint dop1r <dig> as the only essential gαs-coupled protein in the salivary glands, it supports the premise that we are not targeting dop2r, which signals via gαi. as observed with dop1r <dig> rnai, gαs rnai under the control of the sgs <dig> promoter  does not lead to compromised viability . a follow-up molecular analysis confirmed expression of dop1r <dig> in salivary glands of wild type prepupae , as has been documented in other insect species .fig.  <dig> gαs-targeted, but not gαi-targeted kd in the salivary glands results in pre-adult lethality. expression of either of two gαs  rnai constructs  <cit>  under the control of p{gawb} <dig>  driver induces lethality before eclosion . expression of the gαi  rnai construct, using the same driver, does not compromise viability . survival is expressed as percent of balancer progeny. driver stocks: gαs line 1: fbst <dig>  gαs line 2: fbst <dig>  gαi line: fbst <dig>  gαs line 1: n =  <dig>  gαs line 2: n =  <dig>  gαi: n =  <dig>  two replicates were performed for each of the three g protein rnai driver lines. error bars indicate the standard error of the mean

delivery of a dop1r <dig> antagonist to larvae results in reduced viability, abnormal melanization and cuticle defects
pharmacological assessment of dop1r <dig> activity in vitro confirmed that flupenthixol dihydrochloride, with an ic <dig> of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> m , is a potent antagonist of this dopamine receptor  <cit> . given the in vitro results, this compound was used to manipulate dop1r2-mediated signaling in vivo, thus providing a means to complement the rnai genetic manipulations described above. administering flupenthixol  to drosophila second instar larvae resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in adult eclosion with an ec <dig> of  <dig>  mm  and developmental delay . when flupenthixol was administered to drosophila third instar feeding larvae , emerging adults displayed abnormal melanization and cuticle defects , and these phenotypes were not observed in corresponding control flies . importantly, the morphological defects resulting from administration of a dop1r <dig> antagonist  are similar to those observed with genetic knockdown of dop1r <dig> . we cannot exclude that flupenthixol also inhibits signaling at other gpcrs  <cit> . however, taken together, our complementary pharmacological and genetic data support the premise that dop1r <dig> regulates the observed phenotypes.

discussion
our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate the development of an adult fruit fly continues to expand. insect metamorphosis relies on temporal and spatial cues that mediate the transition from the larval to the adult stage. numerous gene families are tightly regulated to ensure normal insect metamorphosis, including genes that trigger larval tissue histolysis and genes that are responsible for protecting the morphing organism against microbial assault, as well as genes that mediate the formation of new adult structures. we show that a drosophila dopamine receptor, i.e., the d1-like receptor dop1r <dig>  plays an important role in suppressing the expression of genes, which when up-regulated, lead to developmental arrest.

by using a reverse genetic approach, we show that ubiquitous knockdown of dop1r <dig> results in pre-adult lethality that is dependent on receptor function during the third instar larval stage . dop1r <dig> rnai adult flies that escape pre-adult lethality display multiple morphological phenotypes including hypomelanization, abnormally shaped/curly wings and defects in the cuticle  . the curly wing phenotype displayed by dop1r <dig> rnai escapers is very similar to that seen in flies that overexpress  tyrosine hydroxylase  in dopaminergic cells  <cit> . in agreement with this observation, th is among the genes that respond to reduction in dop1r <dig> knockdown  . this finding may suggest that:  dop1r <dig> participates in the negative regulation of th, or  compensatory mechanisms are triggered to restore normal da-mediated signaling in the dying dop1r <dig> rnai organisms. the wing and melanization abnormalities seen in dop1r <dig> rnai escapers could be the consequence of th dysregulation in the epidermal dopaminergic cells of the wing and cuticle. these cells have been shown to synthesize/secrete da during molting and eclosion in drosophila  <cit> . under normal conditions, a peak of th activity is detected in late l <dig> larvae/white prepupae  <cit> , consistent with a role for dop1r <dig> during these stages of development.

decreased dop1r <dig> function leads to increased transcription of several cuticular proteins , including edg <dig> and pcp . along with ecdysone, many cps play critical roles in puparial cuticle formation and sclerotization  <cit> . proteins encoded by ecdysone-dependent genes  include temporally regulated cps that are induced by increased ecdysteroid levels in the hemolymph  <cit> . in drosophila, edg <dig> responds to 20e pulses and is abundantly expressed in the epidermis during early pupal development, at the time of exocuticle synthesis  <cit> . ‘pupal cuticle protein’  is also temporally regulated by 20e, and is required for a successful third larval instar to pupal developmental transition. notably, pcp is most tightly regulated via a small 20e titer rise around the time of head eversion  <cit> . dysregulated expression of cps in dop1r <dig> rnai flies may also contribute to the observed abnormal phenotypes, specifically in the tergum .

to better assess the spatial requirements underlying dop1r <dig> rnai-induced developmental arrest in drosophila, we selectively drove dop1r <dig> dsrna in various tissues/cell types . our microarray analysis, which showed up-regulation of salivary glands specific genes , suggested involvement of this tissue in mediating dop1r <dig> effects. consistent with this observation, although most tissue-specific drivers resulted in normal progeny, targeting dop1r <dig> knockdown to salivary glands  led to arrested development/abnormal tergum in corresponding pharate adults. in addition, the corresponding progeny that escaped lethality displayed melanization and/or wing defects that were highly reminiscent of the phenotypes seen following ubiquitous dop1r <dig> knockdown . a follow-up molecular analysis confirmed expression of dop1r <dig> in salivary glands isolated from wild type prepupae . this finding correlates with previous studies in other insect species , which have demonstrated dopaminergic innervation of peripheral secretory cells in the acini, and along the ducts, of the salivary glands . more recently, d1-like dopamine receptors were found in the salivary glands of adult ticks and cockroaches, where they may play a role during the feeding phase, as well as modulate salivary secretion, myoepithelial cell contraction and effects of neuropeptides  <cit> .

a function for dop1r <dig> in salivary glands is consistent with:  the observed  deregulation of genes that are selectively expressed in this organ , and  the david go clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes , which reveals enrichment in salivary gland biological processes. a compelling example comes from the family of eig71e  puff genes that are  induced exclusively in salivary glands, and specifically during puparium formation   <cit> . it is known that the corresponding l <dig> small defensin-like polypeptides are secreted from the salivary glands between the prepupal cuticle and imaginal epidermis, to help protect the metamorphosing organism against infection  <cit> . the eig71e genes participate in the secondary response to 20e , which itself depends on the expression of the early-late genes br-c and e <dig>  <cit> . br-c expression is also up-regulated in dop1r <dig> rnai flies, and derepression of this gene could lead to subsequent induction of the eig71e genes in dop1r <dig> rnai flies. our studies support the premise that dop1r <dig> acts upstream of selected late genes. of note, although three out of four salivary gland drivers resulted in corresponding dsdop1r <dig> progeny displaying comparable phenotypes , no phenotype was observed when using the sgs3-gal <dig> driver. this may be due to temporal discrepancy between activation of the sgs <dig> glue gene promoter and that of dop1r <dig> 

the late pupal death induced by knockdown of dop1r <dig> in salivary glands is reminiscent of that observed in flies that down-regulate, in the same tissue, the low abundance ecdysone receptor minor subtype ecr-a  <cit> . future studies comparing the levels of ecrs and their subcellular localization in dop1r <dig> rnai flies may prove informative.

the combination of pharmacological and rnai  approaches to inhibit/knockdown insect d1-like receptor signaling  has provided a powerful means to dissect the role of these receptors in regulating motor behavior  <cit>  or gregarious behavior  <cit> . further supporting the role of dop1r <dig> in development, pharmacological treatment of larvae with the established d1-like receptor antagonist flupenthixol dihydrochloride  results in pre-adult developmental delay/arrest , as well as abnormal melanization and cuticle defects in escapers , that recapitulate those observed by genetic manipulation of dop1r <dig> expression. importantly, flupenthixol and other selected compounds that also inhibit the mosquito aadop <dig> receptor, which is the aedes aegypti ortholog of the fly dop1r <dig> receptor, have emerged as promising candidate insecticides to control vector arthropods  <cit> . our analysis, which documents drug-induced morphological abnormalities in adults that escape lethality, further highlights the potential of d1-like receptor antagonists as promising insecticides. such anatomical defects would likely compromise survival of disease-transmitting insect vectors in the field.

notably, analysis of genes that are differentially expressed in response to reduced levels of dop1r <dig> reveals that the vast majority of them  are up-regulated . this observation suggests that dop1r <dig> may play an important role in repressing gene expression. functional annotation analysis of the genes for which expression increases ≥  <dig>  times, using david bioinformatic resources  <cit> , identifies enrichment in genes implicated in several biological processes for which temporal regulation is critical . several of the gene clusters fall under the go term categories defense response, immune response, and response to heat, as well as salivary gland morphogenesis and histolysis .

such deregulated activation of the immune system  in the developing fly may contribute to the observed lethal phenotype. it is well-established that in drosophila the balance between repression and induction of the immune defense is tightly regulated, and ensures optimal growth and size at metamorphosis . control of the innate immunity enables larval growth amidst the plethora of bacteria and fungi found in the natural larval feeding environment and ensures high tolerance for the larval gut commensal microbiota, which has been shown to promote development . conversely, deregulated immune responses can alter normal fly growth and development. abdelsadik and roeder  have demonstrated that chronic activation of the immune system of larval salivary glands is detrimental to fly development and survival  <cit> . similarly, rynes et al.  have shown that chronic inflammation of the larval gut epithelium results in developmental delay, growth retardation and lethality  <cit> .

recent advances in the field have unraveled an exquisite interplay of negative regulators of the immune deficiency  pathway that together adapt the immune response to the microbiome encountered by the developing fly . these factors are essential to larval growth and immune homeostasis , and loss-of-function mutations in these negative regulators can result in larval death  <cit> . our results suggest that down-regulation of dop1r <dig> leads to up-regulation of multiple antimicrobial peptides , including the cecropins ceca <dig> and ceca <dig> , which are gut peptides strongly induced upon infection in an imd/relish-dependent manner  <cit> . in non-pathogenic conditions, these amps are expressed during metamorphosis  <cit>  and are regulated by ecdysone  <cit> . two other amps, dro <dig> and dro <dig>  together with lysx, hsp70bc, hsp67bb and hsp <dig> , comprise a small group of genes that respond to changes in fly gut microbiota  <cit> . lysx is a known effector of imd response  <cit> . increased expression of an entire set of drosophila-specific immune-induced molecules  is observed in dop1r <dig> rnai animals . these short peptides, which are normally released into the hemolymph following septic injury, are postulated to act as chemokines  <cit> . importantly, im <dig>  im <dig>  im <dig>  im <dig>  im <dig>  im <dig>  along with dro <dig> and attb , were recently identified within a group of  <dig> amps and ims that are markedly up-regulated in mutant drosophila deficient in activating transcription factor  <dig>  atf <dig>  atf <dig> plays an essential role in larval growth, and is highly expressed in the larval gut, salivary glands and malpighian tubules  <cit> . the overlap between the dysregulated gene set  induced by dop1r <dig> deficiency, and that induced by atf <dig> deficiency, suggests an important role for dop1r <dig> in the control of the immune response.

in addition to antimicrobial peptides, our study shows that the expression levels of multiple heat shock/stress genes increase in response to dop1r <dig> deficiency, including the major heat-inducible proteins , and small heat shock proteins  . these chaperones are postulated to play a role in normal development, and under non-heat shock conditions, exhibit a peak of expression during the late l3/early pupal stages  <cit> . expression of small hsps is regulated by a rise in the molting hormone ecdysone  <cit> . hsp <dig>  hsp67bb and hsp67bc belong to a group of four hsps that regulate morphogenesis, and buffer developmental processes from environmental assault. interestingly, the genes that encode hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp67bb and hsp67bc all cluster within a short  genomic region at cytological location 67b on chromosome 3 l , consistent with possible co-regulation of their expression. high levels of hsp <dig> in drosophila  are sufficient to decrease organismal growth, development and survival to adulthood  <cit> . up-regulation of this gene alone in developing dop1r <dig> rnai flies  may thus contribute to the observed lethal phenotype that results from reduced dop1r <dig> function.

a complementary david go clustering analysis  <cit>  was used to identify previously published studies with data sets that best correlate with the set of differentially expressed genes in dop1r <dig> rnai flies. intriguingly, the two most significant reports  both investigate chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activity during metamorphosis  <cit> . in both studies, the authors show that deficiency in an ecdysone-dependent transcription co-factor affects expression of a limited subset of immune-related genes. the genes identified exhibit substantial overlap with those that respond to dop1r <dig> knockdown . in support of a potential role of dop1r <dig> in the regulation of transcription, sequence analysis  reveals the presence of a bipartite nuclear localization signal , as well as a baf1/abf <dig> chromatin reorganizing factor motif  , within the dop1r <dig> protein. both features are found nested in the third intracellular loop of the receptor. interestingly, in mammals selected gpcrs  have been shown to localize at the nuclear membrane where they modulate gene expression . notably, patel et al., have shown that the human orphan gpr <dig>  harbors a bipartite nls and translocates to the nucleus where it plays an essential role in modulating cell proliferation  <cit> .

we postulate that under normal conditions, at the time of ecdysone-responsive early gene induction , dop1r <dig> in the salivary glands participates in the co-repression of ecdysone-responsive late genes. we propose that the premature release of the dop1r <dig> inhibitory effect  translates into increased expression of the l <dig> defensin-like polypeptides, as well as a series of antimicrobial peptides, stress proteins/chaperones, cuticle and morphogenesis proteins in a de-synchronized manner. this misexpression could be highly detrimental to the developing fly, in agreement with a number of studies discussed above  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our analyses strongly suggest a role for dop1r <dig> in the developmental control of genes at the onset of metamorphosis. dop1r <dig> rnai drosophila display developmental arrest and morphological defects, as well as show dysregulated expression of genes involved in ecdysone response, morphogenesis and immunity. tissue-specific rnai- mediated knockdown of dop1r <dig> reveals an important role for this receptor in salivary glands, during the larval-to-pupal ecdysis. in addition, pharmacological inhibition of dop1r <dig>  using a d1-like receptor small molecule antagonist recapitulates the abnormal phenotypes observed via genetic manipulation, and highlights the potential of drugs that target dop1r <dig> as promising insecticides. our study provides a framework to further probe the molecular mechanisms that contribute to dop1r2-induced regulation of fly development.
