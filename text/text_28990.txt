BACKGROUND
aquatic vascular plants are a distinctive group, differing from terrestrial plants in their growth forms and habitats. they have multiple evolutionary origins from terrestrial environments and show a complex evolutionary history  <cit> . many genera and species of aquatic plants are distributed worldwide  <cit> . recently, the historical biogeographic scenarios of some genera, including their areas of origin and dispersal routes, have been inferred in the context of phylogenetics based on molecular evidence . however, the biogeographic history of cosmopolitan species of aquatic plants is seldom studied and needs to be explored through phylogeographic studies based on a broader sampling scheme.

an exponential growth of plant phylogeographic studies has been observed in europe and north america in the past two decades, and a similar trend has recently been found in china and adjacent regions  <cit> . common genetic discontinuities, locations of refuges, and routes of colonisation have been revealed in some regions by comparing phylogeographic structures among species . in these plant phylogeographic studies, the majority of surveys were conducted on tree species and terrestrial plants, whereas studies on aquatic plants have been relatively scarce  <cit> . these studies on aquatic plants focused primarily on two groups: seagrasses  and emergent macrophytes in freshwater environments . few studies have focused on freshwater submerged species , whose evolutionary processes are most likely distinct from those of emergent species due to their occurrence in exclusively aquatic habitats  <cit> , and seagrasses due to their lower population connectivity in discrete and patchy habitats  <cit> . therefore, phylogeographic studies on freshwater submerged macrophytes will provide new insights to increase our understanding of plant evolution.

here, we focus on the submerged plant genus hydrilla, a monotypic genus of the family hydrocharitaceae, which is distributed worldwide. the single hydrilla species h. verticillata  royle  is found on all continents except antarctica  <cit> . this species is native to asia, but it is uncertain whether it is truly native to europe, australia and africa. hydrilla was first recorded in north america from  <dig> and south america from  <dig>  <cit> . similar to most aquatic plants, hydrilla possesses a variety of reproductive strategies to ensure its growth and establishment, including reproduction through seeds, fragmentation, turions on leaf axils and tubers   <cit> . hydrilla grows in various types of aquatic habitats  from tropical to temperate regions, and apparent morphological and karyological variations have been observed in different populations worldwide . monoecious and dioecious strains and diploid, triploid and tetraploid plants have also been reported in hydrilla  <cit> . furthermore, high levels of genetic differentiation have been revealed among worldwide samples of hydrilla based on isoenzyme patterns  <cit> , random amplified polymorphic dna  profiling  <cit> , and dna sequences  <cit> . however, previous investigations did not include a sufficient number of samples to explore the evolutionary processes of this submerged species worldwide.

in this study, we first examined the phylogeographic structure of an extensive sample population of hydrilla from china using sequences of the chloroplast trnl-f region. we then inferred the biogeographic history of hydrilla by combining the trnl-f sequences from previous studies conducted worldwide. our objectives were  to examine the genealogical patterns of hydrilla in china, and  to infer the original area and dispersal route of hydrilla. this study will provide a good example for us to understand the evolutionary processes that occur in submerged macrophytes.

RESULTS
genetic variation and phylogeographic structure
a total of  <dig> sequences were obtained, with lengths ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp. the length of the aligned sequences was  <dig>  bp, and  <dig> polymorphic sites were observed, including  <dig> indels and  <dig> base substitutions. the sequences were collapsed into  <dig> haplotypes . the two most common haplotypes were c <dig>  and b <dig> , which were present in  <dig> populations and  <dig> populations, respectively. haplotypes d <dig>  b <dig>  a <dig>  and b <dig> were detected in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> populations, respectively. the remaining three haplotypes, a <dig>  b <dig>  and c <dig>  were each present in a single population. of the  <dig> populations we surveyed,  <dig> populations were monomorphic and consisted of a single haplotype. in the nine groups we defined based on river basins, the highest diversity was present in the yangtze river basin  and the river basins in southeast china  . however, no polymorphism was detected in the three river basins located in northeast china and north china. the hd and pi values for all of the populations surveyed were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively .

a haplotype network was constructed with four distinct groups based on all haplotypes from worldwide samples  . the first group included four haplotypes  and two chinese haplotypes  involved all of the basins except for rb <dig> in south china, whereas the frequency of occurrence was low in the three basins  located in the southern part of china. the second group only included one haplotype, d <dig>  and was detected in two basins . in rb <dig>  the second group was restricted to the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river. the third group consisted of six haplotypes , of which four chinese haplotypes  occurred mostly south of the yangtze river in five basins . the fourth group comprised haplotypes a <dig>  a <dig> and h <dig>  of which two chinese haplotypes were only found in six populations located in south and southeast china in four basins  . a permutation test showed that nst  was significantly greater than gst , indicating that closely related haplotypes tended to occur in the same area. an amova revealed that  <dig>  % of the total variation occurred within populations, and  <dig>  % occurred between populations. the global fst value  indicated a significant genetic structure among the  <dig> hydrilla populations. when we grouped the populations into basins, an amova showed that large amounts of variation occurred both among the basins  and among the populations within basins  and that  <dig>  % of the variation occurred within populations. the mismatch distribution of the overall populations was multimodal , and a sudden expansion model for hydrilla was therefore rejected.fig.  <dig> sampling sites of hydrilla populations and geographical distribution of cpdna haplotypes. a) sampling sites of  <dig> hydrilla populations and geographical distribution of nine haplotypes of trnl-f sequences in china. the numbers 1- <dig> indicate nine main river basins: the amur-heilong river basin , the liao river and hai river basin , the yellow river basin , the huai river basin , the yangtze river basin , river basins in southeast china , the pearl river basin , river basins in south china , and river basins in southwest china . b) haplotype network of the chloroplast trnl-f region. the haplotypes without colour are not found in china. black dots and short lines represent inferred interior nodes that were absent in the samples



phylogenetic relationships
the accessions collected from worldwide by madeira et al.  <cit>  were collapsed into  <dig> haplotypes: h <dig> , h <dig> , h <dig> , h <dig> , h <dig> , h <dig> , h <dig> , h <dig> , and h <dig> . four of the haplotypes were the same as haplotypes identified in our samples: h1 = b <dig>  h2 = b <dig>  h5 = b <dig>  and h6 = a <dig>  thus, a total of  <dig> haplotypes were obtained and employed for phylogenetic reconstruction using three outgroups. ml analysis and bayesian inference produced a similar topology . the monophyly of hydrilla was strongly supported by both analyses  = 100 %, posterior probability  =  <dig> ). four distinct clades with robust support were revealed among the  <dig> haplotypes of hydrilla, consistent with four groups of the haplotype network. haplotypes of the a lineage  were located in south and southeast china and southeast asia. b lineage haplotypes  were present in korea, south of the yangtze river in china, south asia, burundi, australia and north america. the a and b lineages grouped into a clade with high support values . c lineage haplotypes  were found in most areas of china, japan and poland. the d lineage haplotype  was present only in china, showing a narrow range .fig.  <dig> chronogram of hydrilla inferred from trnl-f sequences using beast. two clade constraints are indicated with blank asterisks. grey boxes indicate the 95 % highest posterior density intervals. the maximum likelihood bootstrap values of  <dig> and above  and the posterior probabilities of  <dig>  and above  are shown at the nodes



divergence time estimates
the stem and crown ages of hydrilla were estimated to be  <dig>  ma  and  <dig>  ma , respectively, based on the combined data . due to no bootstrap support for the internal nodes of hydrilla in the multigene tree, which was caused by low polymorphism , the trnl-f sequences were used to estimate interior divergence times. the crown age of clade a + b was estimated to be  <dig>  ma  based on the trnl-f sequence data . the crown node ages of clades a, b and c were dated to  <dig>  ma ,  <dig>  ma  and  <dig>  ma , respectively .fig.  <dig> chronogram of hydrocharitaceae inferred from combined 18s + rbcl + matk + trnk 5’ intron + rpob + rpoc1 + cob + atp <dig> sequence data using beast. three calibration points are indicated with blank asterisks. grey boxes indicate 95 % highest posterior density intervals. the maximum likelihood bootstrap values of  <dig> and above  and the posterior probabilities of  <dig>  and above  are shown at the nodes



historical biogeography inference
the s-diva, bbm and dec analyses conducted with different numbers of maximum area settings obtained similar biogeographic inferences, with the exception of several nodes, and only the results for the  <dig> maximum areas are presented. the s-diva, bbm and dec analyses all suggested that the ancestral area of hydrilla at node  <dig> was east asia with the highest likelihood. for the ancestral range of interior node  <dig> of clade a + b and node  <dig> of clade c, east asia was supported by all three analyses with the highest likelihood. at node  <dig> of clade a and node  <dig> of clade b, east asia was supported as the ancestral range by bbm, whereas east asia plus southeast asia and east asia plus oceania were inferred by s-diva and dec, respectively . dispersal and vicariant events were also revealed. all the three analyses postulated vicariant events at nodes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the dispersal events were detected at nodes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> in s-diva analysis, at nodes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> in bbm analysis and at nodes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> in dec analysis.fig.  <dig> reconstruction of the ancestral area of hydrilla. the pie charts at each node were obtained using dec analysis, and the smaller pie charts above and below each node were obtained through s-diva and bbm analysis, respectively. the colours correspond to possible ancestral areas; black with an asterisk represents other ancestral ranges; and white with “mix” indicates too many possible ancestral areas to determine. lowercase letters represent different regions: a) europe ; b) east asia ; c) africa ; d) south asia ; e) southeast asia ; f) oceania 



discussion
genetic variation in hydrilla
at the population level, more than three-fourths of the populations are composed of only a single haplotype. although the percentage may be overestimated due to limited samples of each population and a single cpdna fragment used, lack of intra-population variation seems frequent. this is most likely attributed to the strong ability of hydrilla to reproduce asexually. hydrilla populations can expand rapidly via various vegetative propagules, including plant fragmentation, turions and tubers . as vegetative reproduction is common in aquatic plants, modest variations within populations have also been observed in other species, e.g., ranunculus bungei  <cit> , podostemum ceratophyllum  <cit> , and hippuris vulgaris  <cit> . moreover, certain studies based on nuclear markers suggested that founder effects played an important role in the establishment of populations in aquatic plants  <cit> . to explore the role of founder effects in shaping population structure of hydrilla, further studies using nuclear markers are needed.

this study suggests that china is most likely the central area of genetic diversity for hydrilla. both madeira et al.  <cit>  and benoit  <cit>  identified three clades from worldwide samples of hydrilla based on chloroplast trnl-f sequences, corresponding closely to those identified by madeira et al.  <cit>  using rapd. as china is the geographic centre of the distribution range of hydrilla, the small number of accessions from china  included in these studies is insufficient. combined with the trnl-f sequences of samples obtained worldwide, our results revealed four clades in hydrilla, and china was the only area in which haplotypes from all four clades occurred . furthermore, a low level of genetic variation was observed in hydrilla samples from other areas, e.g., in europe, nearly identical isoenzyme patterns were observed in plants from ireland and poland  <cit>  and the same trnl-f sequences were present in plants from ireland and latvia  <cit> ; in africa, similar isoenzyme patterns or genetic types were revealed in plants from uganda, rwanda and burundi  <cit> ; in south asia, samples from nepal, pakistan and india grouped into the same cluster according to random amplified polymorphic dna  analysis  <cit>  and exhibited the same trnl-f sequences  <cit> ; in southeast asia, individuals from vietnam, thailand, malaysia and indonesia grouped into the same cluster according to rapd analysis  <cit>  and included two clades of trnl-f sequences  <cit> , fig. 2; and in australia, samples from five localities included two clades of trnl-f sequences  <cit> . based on  <dig> samples from various areas in asia and the indo-pacific region, the highest genetic diversity was found in china with microsatellite markers  <cit> . therefore, the highest genetic diversity of hydrilla was most likely detected in populations from china.

phylogeographic structure of hydrilla
an important characteristic of hydrilla is the high value of global fst , indicating that most genetic variation is found among populations. the results of an amova suggested that half of the detected genetic variations should be ascribed to genetic differentiation among the basins. this finding was supported by the significant phylogeographic structure revealed, in which the haplotypes of lineage c mostly occurred in the northern part of china, lineage b occurred in the southern part of china, lineage d haplotype was restricted to the huai river and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river, and lineage a was restricted to the southeast corner of china . according to the distribution of haplotypes in basins, the isolation of individual basins appears to constitute a barrier to inter-basin gene flow. high genetic differentiation among basins was also reported in some species of aquatic plants, e.g., batrachium bungei  <cit> , podostemum irgangii  <cit> , and podostemum ceratophyllum  <cit> . however, unlike these species, hydrilla can form tubers, which may survive for several days after removal from water  <cit>  and remain viable even after ingestion and regurgitation by waterfowl  <cit> . it is possible that waterfowl migration could transport viable tubers across water basins. the high genetic differentiation of hydrilla populations observed among basins may be attributed to other factors associated with the process of colonisation. two phylogeographic studies on aquatic plants with extensive sampling have been conducted in china . similarly, no significant phylogeographic structure was revealed in these two species, and the highest diversity was reported from northeast china, a finding that is different from hydrilla’s pattern. because the two species are emergent and their evolutionary processes are likely to differ significantly from submerged groups  <cit> , it is necessary to conduct comparative phylogeographic studies focusing on submerged macrophytes.

biogeographic history of hydrilla
the divergence time estimates for hydrilla showed a remarkably long branch between the stem node of this genus in the late eocene and its crown node in the late miocene , suggesting long-term stasis or extinct lineages before diversification in hydrilla, similar to what has been found in several other genera of hydrocharitaceae, such as najas, ottelia, and blyxa  <cit> . the east asian origin of hydrilla inferred through ancestral area reconstruction is supported by the fact that china is most likely the centre of genetic diversity for this genus. the first diversification of hydrilla into three lineages  was dated to the late miocene  and may have been triggered by the existence of warm-cool alternations and a cold, dry climate due to strengthened east asian winter monsoons during the late miocene and pliocene . clade a + b dispersed from east asia to other areas and then diverged into clades a and b during the early pliocene . the diversification events for clades a, b and c were all dated to the pleistocene epoch, associated with quaternary glacial/interglacial cycles. due to the interior divergence times in hydrilla were estimated by the trnl-f sequences despite its high polymorphism , their accuracy needed to be further tested by more sequence data.

the three analyses  inferred vicariance at nodes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  of which node  <dig> is the crown node of clade a and  <dig> is the crown node of clade b with robust support , indicating a vicariant event during the diversification in clade a and in clade b. the crown ages of both clades were dated to the pleistocene epoch, in which cool glacial periods and warm interglacial periods were alternative. climate change could be responsible for the vicariant events . for example, in clade a east asian populations could have been isolated from southeast asian ones during more than one glacial period due to the emergence or disappearance of large land areas between these two areas caused by great sea level fluctuation  <cit> . the s-diva, bbm and dec analyses inferred dispersal events at different nodes except node  <dig>  most dispersal events were relatively recent, suggesting that waterfowl dispersals are likely given transoceanic distribution. waterfowl are considered the most significant dispersal agents for aquatic plants  <cit> . although the ability of seeds to maintain viability after passing through the gut has been reported in some groups of submerged macrophytes, such as potamogeton and najas  <cit> , whether hydrilla seeds can survive digestion by waterfowl has not been tested thus far. some dispersal events, e.g., from east asia to southeast asia in clade a and from east asia to south asia in clade b, are coincident with two major flyways for anatidae in asia  <cit> , indicating the role of waterfowl in hydrilla distribution.

implications for the invasion of hydrilla
introducing the natural enemies of weeds into their native range is an effective way to control invasive weeds. thus, it is important to pinpoint the likely origin of invasive weeds. two biotypes of hydrilla  have been recognised in the united states  <cit> . these biotypes are thought to have been separately introduced  <cit> . the dioecious plants were reported to have been introduced from sri lanka to florida  <cit> , and the south asian geographic origin of the us dioecious hydrilla was confirmed in genetic studies  <cit> . the occurrence of the common haplotype b1/h <dig> in china  indicates that the southern part of east asia is also a possible original site for the us dioecious hydrilla. the monoecious plants found in the us were possibly introduced from korea based on genetic similarity  <cit> . the occurrence of the common haplotype b4/h <dig> in eastern china  suggests eastern china as one of the original areas for the us monoecious hydrilla. due to the independent origin of the two biotypes of hydrilla, the search for natural enemies of hydrilla needs to be conducted in each original range, especially in the common area of china.

the northernmost monoecious hydrilla population occurs in the lucerne/pipe lakes complex in washington, at  <dig> ° north latitude  <cit> . the northernmost dioecious hydrilla population was found in idaho but lacks detailed location information; it is most likely located at approximately 42° north latitude  <cit> . the two biotypes both belong to clade b in the phylogenetic tree . in their native range, the hydrilla populations belonging to clade c occur farther north than the populations belonging to clade b . the northernmost population we collected occurs at  <dig> ° north latitude, a latitude similar to that of the us-canada border. based on their latitudinal distribution, hydrilla plants from clade c could easily occur in the border area between the us and canada. thus, importing hydrilla from the northern part of east asia and europe should be forbidden to avoid a new invasion of hydrilla into north america.

CONCLUSIONS
our study reveals that china is most likely the centre of genetic diversity in hydrilla, and our findings point to an east asian origin of hydrilla. the study provides empirical evidence, based on a phylogeographic analysis, that reveals the complex biogeographic history of diversification and colonisation in worldwide species of submerged macrophytes. our results will be more persuasive once more extensive samples from other countries are included. comparative studies on other submerged macrophytes that are distributed worldwide would be valuable in better understanding the diversification and colonisation of this distinct group of plants.
