BACKGROUND
fluorescent viral particles represent an extremely useful tool for the study of virus-cell interaction. for this reason many efforts have been devoted to the recovery of fluorescent viruses of different species, including herpesviruses  <cit> , adenoviruses  <cit> , rhabdoviruses  <cit> , and the african swine fever virus  <cit> . concerning hiv, on the one hand, virions which lead to only the infected cell becoming fluorescent were generated by replacing the nef gene with the enhanced green fluorescent protein  gene  <cit>  or by inserting a gfp-ires cassette upstream to nef  <cit> . on the other hand, hiv particles, which themselves were fluorescent due to the incorporation of a fluorescent fusion protein, were generated by inserting the gfp gene between the matrix and capsid gag sequences  <cit> . of note, however, such engineered hiv- <dig> derivatives, although replication-competent, suffer of limitations in their replication efficiency. as an alternative to insertion of the gfp gene into the viral genome, fluorescent hiv- <dig> virions were generated by co-expressing a wild-type hiv- <dig> genome with the gfp-vpr fusion product  <cit> . in this case, the fluorescent signal is detectable only in the first replication cycle, and persist until it is intracellularly degraded. up until now, fluorescent viral particles have been generated by transient transfection procedures and cell lines stably releasing such particles have not yet been available.

similarly to vpr, the hiv nef protein is incorporated in hiv- <dig> particles, even if at lower levels, i.e. approximately  <dig> molecules per virion  <cit> . the nef virion incorporation depends on its localization at the cell membrane. this, in turn, depends on its n-terminus myristoylation marked by the presence of a glycine residue at the position  <dig>  as well as on the presence of two clusters of basic amino acids at the n-terminal region, i.e. two lysines at the positions  <dig> and  <dig> and four arginines within the region of amino acid 17– <dig>  <cit> .

hiv is thought to bud at level of the so called "detergent-resistant microdomains"   <cit> , that are regions within the cell membranes enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. several authors demonstrated the presence of nef in rafts  <cit> , even if the relative biologic significance has to be clarified yet. in any case, nef has been found associating poorly  to lipid rafts  <cit> , and this may account for the low amounts of nef incorporated into the virions. hence, a more efficient nef localization at the lipid raft is expected to increase its viral incorporation. this was indeed the case of the hiv- <dig> nef double mutant v153l, e177g we recently described, whose strong raft localization leads to a virion incorporation about 100-fold more efficient than its wt counterpart  <cit> .

palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational protein fatty acylation generally occurring on cysteine residues located close to domains interacting with cell membranes. such a modification regulates the intracellular protein trafficking and the disposition at the cell membrane rafts. in this regard, it was recently demonstrated that the nef palmitoylation produced by mutating the gly  <dig> to cys increases the raft localization up to 12-fold compared with wt nef  <cit> . by consequence, it could be anticipated that palmitoylated nef undergoes virion incorporation with an efficiency significantly higher than the wild-type counterpart.

here, we report that a fusion protein consisting of palmitoylated nef mutant and the green-fluorescent protein  was efficiently incorporated into hiv- <dig> particles. in order to generate a stable source of fluorescent hiv- <dig> virus-like particles , we have then stably introduced an expression vector for nefg3c-gfp into a previously described inducibly regulated 293-based hiv- <dig> packaging cell line. upon induction of these cells , high amounts of fluorescent hiv-1-based vlps were produced which may be employed for both basic research and antiviral screening.

RESULTS
nefg3c-gfp is incorporated in hiv- <dig> virions at high levels
the n-terminal palmitoylation significantly increases the localization at the cell membrane rafts of nef both in its native form  <cit>  and when fused with gfp  <cit> . thus, since rafts are the sites from where hiv preferentially buds  <cit> , we expected that the nefg3c-gfp fusion product would be incorporated into virions at levels which would be high enough to result in the hiv- <dig> particles being highly fluorescent. to validate such a prediction, we compared the levels of incorporation of nefg3c-gfp into virions with those of wt nef and wt nef-gfp. in addition, the virion associated amounts of nefg3c-gfp were compared with those of gfp-vpr, already known to incorporate efficiently in viral particles  <cit> . we co-transfected 293t cells with the pcmvΔr <dig>  hiv- <dig> packaging construct together with vectors expressing each of the above hiv- <dig> protein derivatives. forty-eight hours later, the supernatants were harvested, clarified, and the vlps purified and analyzed by western blot for the incorporation of nef- or gfp-derivatives. we observed that equal amounts of viral particles gave rise to nefg3c-gfp signals much stronger than those produced by both wt nef and wt nef-gfp , and also slightly more intense compared with gfp-vpr . this suggests that nefg3c-gfp is incorporated at high levels in hiv- <dig> viral particles.

since nefg3c strongly associates with cell membranes  <cit> , it is conceivable that at least part of the nefg3c-gfp we detected was associated with microvesicles and/or exosomes rather than to viral particles. to test this possibility, we transfected 293t cells with the nefg3c-gfp expressing vector alone or together with the pcmvΔr <dig>  hiv- <dig> packaging construct. forty-eight hours later, the supernatants were harvested, concentrated and purified as above described, and equal volumes of each preparation were analyzed by anti-nef western blot. as shown in figure 1c, no detectable amounts of nefg3c-gfp were found in supernatants from 293t cells transfected in the absence of the hiv- <dig> packaging construct. this strongly suggests that the most part of nefg3c-gfp molecules we detected in supernatants from the cells co-transfected with the hiv- <dig> packaging construct were indeed associated with viral particles.

these data strongly support the hypothesis that nef palmitoylation results in a significant increase in virion incorporation levels which was the basis to attempt the generation of cells stably releasing vlps with incorporated nefg3c-gfp.

isolation and induction of the 18-4s cell line stably expressing the nefg3c-gfp fusion product
we have used the  <dig> rev-gag-pol  <cit>   as a platform for the generation of stable cells releasing fluorescent hiv- <dig> based vlps. 293/rgp cells are packaging cells for hiv- <dig> derived vectors inducibly expressing and releasing hiv- <dig> vlps. in the 293/rgp cells, the hiv-gag-pol gene and the hiv-rev are separately expressed under the control an ecdysone-inducible promoter  so that particle production requires addition of the ecdysone analogue ponasterone a  to the medium.

293/rgp cells were co-transfected with the vectors expressing the nefg3c-gfp fusion product and the p <dig> human nerve growth factor receptor truncated in its intracytoplasmic domain . indeed, the expression of this marker was useful in the first selection steps, when the cell sorter-based selection led the cells to an unacceptable cell mortality. in this respect, after two anti-ngfr selections followed by two gfp-based cell sorting, we recovered a cell population  more than 95% positive for the nefg3c-gfp expression . of note, at the facs analysis 18-4s cells actually appeared as two distinct sub-populations in terms of the expression of both nefg3c-gfp and Δngfr. 18-4s cell grew with a similar duplication time to that of the parental cells , but tended to float much more easily. the levels of nefg3c-gfp remained stable during two months period in culture, but progressively declining thereafter . this appeared to be the consequence of the silencing rather than the loss of the nefg3c-gfp sequences, since treatment with sodium butyrate restored a gfp facs profile similar to early-passage cells .

we then sought to establish the best experimental conditions for the induction of the expression of hiv- <dig> products in 18-4s cells. following the methods previously described for the 293/rgp cells  <cit> , we treated 18-4s cells with  <dig> mm sodium butyrate and/or pona  <dig> μm, and monitored the expression of hiv- <dig> cap <dig> and nefg3c-gfp by facs two and three days later. specifically, 293/rgp and 18-4s cells were treated with: i) pona alone; ii) both pona and sodium butyrate for one day and, thereafter, with pona alone, or iii) with pona and sodium butyrate. as shown in figure 2b, the treatment with pona alone resulted in inefficient expression of gag products in 18-4s cells, while more than 50% of the parental 293/rgp cells was induced to express gag products. the addition of sodium butyrate was mandatory for significant gag induction in 18-4s cells. in fact, a pulse of sodium butyrate for  <dig> h resulted in 60% of the cells expressing gag whereas its continuous presence for the  <dig> h induction period further increased the percentage of positive cells to 77%. additionally, the expression of nefg3c-gfp was increased 3– <dig> fold. sodium butyrate treatment increased also the percentage of gag positive 293/rgp cells from 57% to more than 80%, and improved the relative mean fluorescence intensity by 2– <dig>  fold. of note, in 18-4s cells the treatment with sodium butyrate alone led to an increase of the nefg3c-gfp expression similar to that induced also in the presence of pona . no remarkable differences in terms of expression of both cap <dig> and nefg3c-gfp were observed between the cells harvested at the day  <dig> and at the day  <dig> . at this time, however, the cell cultures suffered of some cell mortality .

finally, the intracellular localization of nefg3c-gfp we analyzed by fluorescence microscope seemed qualitatively similar to that already described for wt nef  <cit>  in the presence, however, of a stronger localization at the cell membrane .

dose-response of the pona induced production of vlps from 18-4s cells
clearly, the most relevant feature of 18-4s cells was expected to be the ability to produce fluorescent vlps. in this regard, the vlp production efficiency was assayed by inducing 18-4s cells with increasing concentrations of pona in the presence of the optimal doses of sodium butyrate  that was mandatory for the expression of hiv- <dig> cap <dig> and related products. as for 293/rgp, 18-4s cells produced vlps at concentrations that increased with the doses of pona up to  <dig> μm . higher doses of pona did not further increase the amounts of produced vlps . at the highest concentrations of pona, 18-4s cells produced amounts of vlps equivalent to up to  <dig> μg/ml. however, these levels were still 2– <dig> fold lower compared with those from the parental cells. this could be the consequence of the incorporation of the high number of nefg3c-gfp molecules that may in some way decrease the efficiency of the hiv assembling/budding process.

characterization of nefg3c-gfp vlps
next, we molecularly characterized the vlps released by 18-4s cells. the western blot analysis for the cell associated hiv- <dig> gag-related products did not show significant differences compared with the parental cells, while the anti-nef western blot analysis, consistently with the here above reported results, revealed an induction-dependent apparent increase of the nefg3c-gfp expression . concerning the vlp molecular composition, no significant differences were detected in the contents of gag-related products between hiv- <dig> and vlps from 293/rgp or 18-4s cells. on the other hand, and of a major relevance, remarkable amounts of nefg3c-gfp molecules appeared to be associated with the vlps from 18-4s cells, as also confirmed by the anti-gfp western blot analysis . however, in order to ensure that the nefg3c-gfp molecules we detected were indeed incorporated and not just associated with their surface, we additionally performed western blot analysis after a proteolytic treatment of the vlps. thus, vlps from 18-4s which had been pseudotyped with the glycoprotein receptor of the vesicular stomatitis virus  were treated with the subtilisin a protease and analyzed for the presence of both nefg3c-gfp and vsv-g. such a treatment was expected to degrade the viral surface proteins as well as any products non specifically associated with the viral envelope, but should not affect genuinely incorporated proteins. as shown in figure 4b, while the nefg3c-gfp related signal appeared substantially unaffected by the subtilisin a treatment, the vsv-g receptor resulted efficiently degraded. to further support the idea that the nef-related signals we detected by western blot analysis indeed originated from virion incorporated nefg3c-gfp molecules, vlps were purified through a iodixanol gradient, and the recovered fractions analyzed by western blot . the co-sedimentation of nefg3c-gfp and cap <dig> strengthens the conclusion that nefg3c-gfp molecules are indeed incorporated in vlps.

furthermore, we were interested in estimating the number of molecules incorporated in the vlps released from induced 18-4s cells. to this end, we compared the intensity of the signals from decreasing amounts of recombinant  nef with those from decreasing amounts of vlps whose contents in cap <dig> were preventively and rigorously established by quantitative elisa . on the basis of the densitometric analysis carried out on the western blot films , we estimated that  <dig> ng of 18-4s vlps contain approximately  <dig>  ng of nefg3c-gfp molecules. considering the purity of rnef preparation , the differences in the molecular weight between cap <dig> and nefg3c-gfp, and that it was reported that hiv- <dig> particles incorporate approximately  <dig>  molecules of cap <dig> per virion  <cit> , we calculated the presence of about  <dig> nefg3c-gfp molecules per vlp. such an estimation cannot take account of possible differences in the antibody recognition between nefg3c-gfp and wt rnef. these, however, are not expected to be of a major relevance since the anti-nef polyclonal abs preparation we employed was recovered using a full-length wt rnef derivative as immunogen.

finally, we analyzed the morphology of the vlps released by induced 18-4s cells by electron microscope as compared with vlps from parental 293/rgp cells. clearly, 18-4s cells released vlps with a morphology very similar to that of the vlps from parental cells , thus suggesting that the nefg3c-gfp incorporation did not grossly influence the vlp morphology significantly. both vlp populations appeared composed of immature and mature viral particles, the latter bearing the typical electron dense conical cone structures. of note, in both cell cultures, the presence of immature vlps raised significantly with the cell passages 

in conclusion, our data indicate that, upon induction, 18-4s cells produce hiv- <dig> vlps whose morphology was not influenced by the high levels of incorporated nefg3c-gfp molecules.

cytofluorimetric detection of fluorescent nefg3c-gfp vlps
next, we developed a rapid and sensitive assay for the detection of the vlp-associated fluorescence based on the ability of aldehyde latex beads to specifically bind lipid enveloped micro- and nanoparticles. similar tests were previously applied to the analysis of exosomes  <cit> , and here we originally provide evidence that such a method can be fruitfully exploited for the analysis of vlps. in detail, we incubated clarified supernatants from induced 18-4s cells with the aldehyde latex beads at r.t. that, 1– <dig> hours later, were extensively washed and analyzed by facs. the representative results reported in figure 6a demonstrate that this assay can detect as few as  <dig> ng of 18-4s vlps measured as cap <dig> contents. the possible presence of free nefg3c-gfp molecules did not interfere with the facs measurements since no fluorescence increase was found associated to the beads incubated with the supernatants from induced 18-4s cells previously cleared from vlps by ultracentrifugation as compared with the control supernatants . in addition, the actual binding of vlps to the beads was confirmed by the specific labeling of either virion-associated cap <dig> or nef with monoclonal abs we observed only upon a permeabilization step .

we exploited such vlp analytical method to compare the fluorescence associated with nefg3c-gfp vlps with that of vlps incorporating gfp-vpr. to this aim, 293t cells were co-transfected with a hiv- <dig> packaging vector together with the vector expressing the respective gfp-related product, and the released vlps purified on a 20% sucrose cushion. then, equivalent amounts of vlps, as measured by a quantitative anti-cap <dig> elisa, were incubated with aldehyde latex beads, and the fluorescence evaluated by facs. as shown in figure 7a, beads binding nefg3c-gfp vlps showed more than 3-fold increased fluorescence as compared with the gfp-vpr vlps. this was not the result of different transfection efficiencies in the respective producer cells, where the gfp-related products appeared equally expressed , but is consistent with the vlp western blot analysis depicted in figure 1b.

next, to assess whether the nefg3c-gfp system could be applied also to other retroviruses, we evaluated the levels of incorporation of nefg3c-gfp molecules in moloney leukemia virus  particles, that were shown to efficiently incorporate hiv- <dig> nef  <cit> . to this aim, we compared the fluorescence associated to vlps produced in the presence of wt nef-gfp with that of nefg3c-gfp. 293t cells were co-transfected with the vector expressing the respective gfp-related product together with a gag-pol mlv packaging construct, and equivalent amounts of purified vlps, as measured by the mn++ dependent reverse transcriptase assay, were incubated with aldehyde latex beads. the facs analysis  clearly showed low levels of fluorescence associated with wt nef-gfp mlv vlps, while strong gfp-related signals arose from the beads binding the nefg3c-gfp mlv vlps. this result represents the proof-of-principle that the nefg3c-gfp approach could be of utility also for non hiv- <dig> retroviral systems.

pseudotyped 18-4s vlps efficiently deliver nefg3c-gfp molecules in target cells
finally, we were interested in establishing whether and how efficiently 18-4s vlps can fluorescently mark the target cells upon viral entry. to this aim, 18-4s vlps pseudotyped with either the vsv-g   <cit>  or the hiv- <dig> x <dig> env receptors were produced by transfecting 18-4s cells with the appropriate expression vectors and,  <dig> to  <dig> hours later, treating the cells with pona and sodium butyrate. of note, the liposome-mediated transfection worked efficiently in 18-4s as well as in 293/rgp parental cells, ranging the expression of transfected receptors from  <dig> to 95%, as measured by facs . thus, 18-4s cells remained a good recipient for the expression of ectopic sequences. vlp preparations were preventively characterized in terms of their contents of both nefg3c-gfp molecules and the respective receptors . next, we assessed that  <dig> ng/ <dig> cells of vlps pseudotyped with the wt but not with the fusion-mutant vsv-g rendered the majority of challenged cells fluorescent at the facs analysis as early as  <dig> hours after the vlp treatment. . in addition, the pre-treatment of target cells with either bafilomycin a <dig> or chloroquine, i.e. two drugs inhibiting the vsv-g mediated endocytic fusion by raising the endosomal/lysosomal ph, led to a clear reduction of the fluorescence of the challenged cells . we interpret the residual cell-associated fluorescence as the product of the accumulation of fluorescent vlps in not functional endosomes/lysosomes rather than of a suboptimal cell response to the inhibitors. in fact, similar outcomes were obtained also by raising the drug concentrations up to 5-fold .

conversely, and as expected, the viral entry driven by hiv- <dig> env appeared significantly less efficient, considering that  <dig> μg/ <dig> cells of hiv- <dig> env pseudotyped vlps rendered fluorescent about 40% of target cells that also internalized lower amounts of nefg3c-gfp, as indicated by the lower mean fluorescence intensity . the idea that the fluorescence detected in target cells indeed relied on authentic viral fusion events was strengthen by the inhibition we observed upon the pre-incubation of hiv- <dig> env vlps with either the 17b anti-env gp  <dig> , or the 2f <dig> anti-env gp <dig> neutralizing mabs .

the analysis at the fluorescence microscope of the target cells  showed a strong fluorescence associated with  nefg3c-gfp vlp challenged cells, while the fluorescence levels appeared significantly fainter in the cells challenged with the x <dig> env pseudotyped vlps. finally, the confocal microscope analysis formally confirmed that the fluorescence associated with the target cells originated from an authentic cell internalization of fluorescent vlps pseudotyped with vsv-g , or with hiv- <dig> env receptors . besides the above described challenges carried out with vlps lacking functional receptors, such results were validated also by the lack of fluorescence we observed in cells challenged with either vsv-g or x <dig> env pseudotyped vlps and incubated at 4°c . finally, the results obtained in cemss cells were also reproduced in u <dig> cells, primary cd4+ lymphocytes, or human primary monocyte-derived macrophages .

taken together, our data support the idea that the 18-4s cells could be a useful reagent for the study of early events correlating with the viral entry mediated also by heterologous virus receptors.

discussion
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the isolation of a stable cell population releasing fluorescent hiv- <dig> based vlps. the biological features of 18-4s cells do not diverge significantly from those of the 293/rgp parental cells  <cit> , except for a more stringent requirement of sodium butyrate for the vlp production. sodium butyrate is known acting on methylated promoter sequences and/or on surrounding heterochromatinic dna, ultimately leading to the re-activation of silenced genes. this is thought occurring through the hyperacetylation of histone and non-histone nuclear proteins  <cit> . we observed that, in the one hand, the parental 293/rpg cells significantly decreased the levels of vlp release with passages. this was possibly due to a progressive transcriptional silencing of hiv- <dig> regulatory and/or structural genes, and was efficiently reverted by sodium butyrate. this treatment, on the other hand, was absolutely required for the release of vlps from 18-4s cells, likely due to the silencing of hiv- <dig> genes already operative at the time of the cell isolation.

the facs analysis revealed that 18-4s cells are composed by two clearly distinguishable sub-populations in terms of the expression of both nefg3c-gfp and Δngfr. in particular, on the basis of the mean fluorescent intensities we measured by facs, the bright sub-population seemed to accumulate both products about 5-fold more efficiently than the dull one. concerning the most relevant expression of nefg3c-gfp, we noticed that with passages, the bright sub-population tended to reduce, meanwhile appearing a detectable fraction of gfp negative cells. again, this is likely the consequence of the silencing of the nefg3c-gfp sequences rather than to their loss since also in this case the treatment with sodium butyrate resulted in the restoration of the original gfp profile . we have no obvious explanations for the mechanisms underlying the production of the two sharply distinct 18-4s cell sub-populations, even if it may be conceivable that this reflects the differences in the number and/or sites of the integration of the plasmid vectors. in addition, the consequent protein overproduction might be associated with an impaired protein degradation efficiency, thus resulting in steady-state protein levels overriding the real differences in the numbers of integrated vectors.

the 2– <dig> fold decreased levels of vlp release from the 18-4s cell line compared with the parental cells appeared consistent with the reduced viral production we observed in transient transfection experiment , and was possibly due to some steric hindrance occurring during the assembling/release process as the consequence of the high levels of nefg3c-gfp incorporation. of note, the data from em analysis showed that this did not lead to significant morphologic alterations of vlps that in both cases appeared as both mature and immature particles. in this regard, we cannot formally exclude that the significant presence of immature viral particles depended at least in part on a slow kinetic of maturation rendering more difficult the detection of mature particles through the electron microscope observation of ultra-thin cell sections we performed.

the analyses we carried out by facs and by fluorescence and confocal microscopes consistently indicated that the cells targeted by pseudotyped 18-4s vlps become fluorescent as early as  <dig> hours after the challenge. generally speaking, the great part of hiv- <dig> particles undergo cell internalization through a receptor independent endocytosis leading to lysosome degradation  <cit> , whose inhibition, in fact, increases hiv infection  <cit> . in the analysis of the vlp entry we performed, it is worthy of note that the 18-4s vlps pseudotyped with the fusion defective vsv-g or with "null" vlps did not induce a significant increase of the cell fluorescence compared with the mock challenged cells. these results, together with those obtained with chemical inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies, strongly suggests that the cell fluorescence we detected basically relied on the completion of the virus fusion events with the release into the cytoplasm of the fluorescent molecules, a conclusion also supported by our results from the confocal microscope analysis.

we feel the relevance of the 18-4s cells stands in two main fields of application. the first could be the study of the mechanisms and dynamic of viral entry, and the second regards the screening of antiviral compounds targeting the late hiv replication events. in particular, the possibility to pseudotype hiv- <dig> vlps with a wide array of viral receptors could allow gaining more insights on the not yet fully elucidated mechanism of entry of viruses of different species. this is for instance the case of human hepatitis c virus, whose cell receptor/co-receptors have still to be unambiguously identified . in this regard, the cell fluorescence generated by the vlp entry would be a more stringent marker of viral entry compared with the in use systems relying on the lentivirus-mediated transduction of gene markers whose expression can be restricted by host cell factors. on the other hand, the rather simple protocol for the detection of fluorescent vlps by facs we developed renders 18-4s cells a both safe and powerful tool for large-scale screenings of new anti-hiv compounds electively targeted to the assembly/release processes. thus, 18-4s cells are anticipated to be a useful reagent for multiple purposes that will be freely available upon request.

furthermore, from the point of view of the basic virology, the possibility to analyze viral particles by facs as here described opens the way towards new rapid and accurate approaches in the investigation on the molecular composition of enveloped viruses in terms of both viral and virus-associated cell products.

finally, on the basis of the results we obtained with the mlv-based vlps, we expect that the nefg3c-gfp approach could be applied also to different retroviral systems close to hiv- <dig> and mlv.

CONCLUSIONS
fluorescent vlps produced by the 18-4s cell line can be considered a novel reagent useful for studies of virus entry also in fields other than hiv. in addition, by exploiting a facs-based assay for the detection of the vlp fluorescence we here originally describe, 18-4s cells would be of a great utility for screening new generations of antiviral compounds targeting late events of hiv- <dig> replication.
