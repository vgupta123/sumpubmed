BACKGROUND
bifidobacteria represent one of the most predominant groups of commensal bacteria residing in the human and animal gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . bifidobacterium spp. are among the first anaerobes able to reach high levels within the first week of life and generally represent more than 40% of infant gut microbiota  <cit> . different bifidobacterium species are associated with a broad range of beneficial effects on host’s health. their colonization in the gut is associated with modulation of the intestinal microbiota composition and activity, immune-modulation and attenuation of inflammatory symptoms  <cit> . additionally, mechanisms involved in host protection include nutrient competition, competitive exclusion, direct antagonism by inhibitory substances and host-mediated effects such as improved barrier function and altered immune response  <cit> . numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy against enteric pathogens of selected bifidobacterial strains but the mechanistic basis supporting the observed benefits is still often lacking  <cit> . strain dependency is one of the features that have been revealed while seeking for new probiotic strains  <cit> , thus the importance of selection of suitable candidates through biochemical assays targeting potential probiotic functions.

iron is an essential micronutrient for most intestinal commensal and pathogenic bacteria, except for lactobacillus  <cit> . iron is involved in many essential metabolic processes like cell proliferation, electron transport, and is a cofactor for different enzymes  <cit> . for instance, iron plays an important role in most pathogenic bacteria, as iron sequestration mechanism have been associated to cell replication and persistence and thus being involved in pathogenesis  <cit> . however, iron is restricted in most environments including the mammalian intestine  <cit> . the limited availability of iron in the host provides one form of non-specific immune-defence that bacteria, for instance, bacterial pathogens need to overcome in order to grow and cause infection  <cit> . therefore microorganisms have evolved different acquisition systems like import of iron from different sources and production of siderophores to utilize, accumulate and sequester iron  <cit> . various physiological mechanisms such as low/high affinity iron transport systems are employed by bacteria to tightly control iron uptake, intracellular concentration and storage, preventing toxic effects  <cit> . iron starvation signals the up-regulation of acquisition systems and as a response many gram positive bacteria synthesize low molecular weight iron chelating ligands, known as siderophores, to compete for iron  <cit> . in contrast, iron excess activates the expression of efflux pumps and ferritin like proteins involved in iron accumulation  <cit> .

withholding iron has been identified as a major competitive and defense mechanisms in many gram positive and gram negative bacteria, because of its general limited availability in different environments, such as the intestine  <cit> . the concept of restricting iron to pathogens has been coined as nutritional immunity  <cit>  and is usually associated with efficient iron sequestration systems. it has been hypothesized that one of the beneficial actions of health promoting bifidobacteria is to sequester iron, thus making it less available to pathogens, hence representing another form of nutritional immunity  <cit> . the ability of bifidobacteria to outcompete by producing siderophores and/or concentrating iron from the environment may therefore provide a competitive advantage against competing microorganism by limiting the iron available in complex ecosystems such as the gut microbiota. thus, bifidobacteria, may cause iron starvation of competing microorganism; for instance, enteropathogens. however to our knowledge, the ability to produce siderophores in culture supernatant and to internalize iron of diverse bifidobacteria species has never been investigated. we hypothesized that bifidobacteria present in the gut of iron deficient infants efficiently sequester iron. therefore our aim was to isolate bifidobacterium strains from stool samples from iron deficient kenyan infants and to investigate their ability to produce siderophores as well as to sequester iron in comparison to culture collection strains.

RESULTS
isolation and genotypic identification
the bifidobacteria gene copy numbers  was, assessed in the twenty-eight stool samples of kenyan infants by qpcr targeting the xylulose-5-phosphate/fructose-6-phosphatephosphoketolase gene  gene. the mean bifidobacteria cn was log  <dig>  sd +/−  <dig>  copies per gram feces, in the range from log  <dig>  to log  <dig>  copies per gram feces sample. twenty-eight baseline stool samples from kenyan infants were streaked in brs, mrs-cys, tpy and bsm agar supplemented with a strong iron chelator  <dig> -dipiridyl. a total of  <dig> strains were isolated and analyzed by 16s rrna gene sequencing for identification. 16s rrna partial sequences with a length of  <dig> to 1300 bp after quality trimming were aligned for genotypic identification using blast, yielding 41% enterococcus spp. , 29% bifidobacterium spp. , 28% lactobacillus spp. , 1% weisella spp. ,  <dig> % streptoccocus spp.  and  <dig> % leuconostoc spp. . bifidobacterium 16s rrna partial sequences were assigned to six phylogenetic taxa: 34% b. bifidum , 27% b. longum , 19% b. breve , 13% b. kashiwanohense , 5% b. pseudolongum , 2% b. pseudocatenulatum  . b. bifidum was most frequently isolated in bsm and beerens agar, while b. longum and b. breve were obtained from tpy plates and b. kashiwanohense from tpy and bsm plates. bifidobacterium isolated on bsm agar represented five species , compared to four species isolated on beerens, three on tpy and only one on mrs-cys  agar. three different bifidobacteria species were isolated from each stool samples  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , while either one or two bifidobacterial species were obtained from the other samples. in addition, b. kashiwanohense was only found in three fecal samples  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .table  <dig>

characterization based on siderophore production
eighty-six bifidobacterial strains comprising  <dig> isolates and  <dig> culture collection strains were characterized for their ability to produce siderophores using the cas assay . siderophore activity  was found to be widely distributed and strain dependent among bifidobacterial strains. percentage of sa ranged from 3% to 89% siderophore units. to group strains according to sa values, the following ranges were established according to od630nm measurements and color change after mixing with the cas dye. three groups were defined: strains with high sa in the range from 90-60% siderophore units and a color change to orange; strains with intermediate sa in the range from 59-30% and a color change to pink, and strains with intermediate sa in the range from 29-0% and no visible color change. thirty-four strains  belonged to the first group of high sa,  <dig> strains  showed intermediate sa, and  <dig> strains  showed low sa. no correlation was found between sa and hemoglobin levels of the infant stool donor where the strains were isolated . from the thirty-four strains showing high sa,  <dig> strains belonged to public culture collections and  <dig> strains belonged to the isolates. compare to b. bifidum mrsc6- <dig>  the strain with the lowest sa , eight b. breve, five b. bifidum, three b. pseudolongum, four b. kashiwanohense and three b. thermoacidophilum strains showed significantly higher sa . b. breve showed the highest sa value among species, with  <dig> +/− 21%  .figure  <dig>

strains showing similar genotypic identification in the 16s rrna sequence, isolated from same stool sample and plate and that also showed similar sa value; as well as, strains showing low siderophore activity, were excluded from the iron internalization  characterization. therefore  <dig> isolates and  <dig> culture collection strains were available for ii characterization.

dna finger printing
phylogenetic diversity of sixty-two bifidobacterium strains included in the ii characterization was evaluated by dna-finger printing using rapd and rep-pcr . dna finger prints showed that strains retained for the ii characterization were phylogenetically different, except for b. breve tpy 10– <dig> and b. pseudolongum bsm 8– <dig> as they showed identical dna finger prints with b. breve tpy 10– <dig> and b. pseudolongum bsm 8– <dig>  respectively.

characterization based on iron internalization
sixty bifidobacterial strains comprising  <dig> isolates and  <dig> culture collection strains were characterized by the iron uptake assay determined by using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer. iron internalization  was found to be strain dependent and b. kashiwanohense was the bifidobacterial species with the highest overall iron internalization of 78 μm +/−  <dig>  . iron concentrations tested in bifidobacterial pellets ranged from 8 μm to 118 μm . eight b. longum strains, six b. kashiwanohense, three b. bifidum, one b. pseudolongum and one b. breve showed significantly higher ii values  than b. thermoacidophilum lmg <dig> exhibiting the lowest ii of 8 μm.figure  <dig>

discussion
in the present study,  <dig> bifidobacterial strains with high iron sequestration properties were isolated from fecal samples of iron deficient kenyan infants, most of them anemic, using an iron depleted culture dependent approach. we assumed for our research that in breast-fed infants little iron enters the colon and thus low iron availability is expected in the gut. indeed, iron content in breast milk was reported to be in the range from  <dig>  mg/l to  <dig>  mg/l  <cit> . thus, a high competition of strains for iron would be present in the gut of breast fed infants, creating selective pressure for strains with high iron sequestration properties. after the genotypic identification the iron sequestration properties of the isolates were measured and compared to those of culture collection strains.

using qpcr targeting the xfp gene, high populations of bifidobacteria were found in fecal samples of kenyan infants in agreement with previous studies where population was found to be in the range of 109- <dig> gene copy numbers per gram feces in breast fed infants  <cit> . to perform the enrichment of bifidobacterial diversity with high iron sequestration mechanisms a culture dependent approach was applied, combining the low iron environment characterized from kenyan infants, with the use of  <dig> -dipiridyl which is a strong chelator for iron. the most frequently isolated bifidobacterial species were b. bifidum, b. longum, b. breve, b. pseudolongum and b. pseudocatenulatum which are species frequently found in the infant gut  <cit> . the application of strong iron limitation during the isolation process may have limited the growth of some bifidobacterial species that could not grow under these stringent conditions. on the other hand the identification of strains from six phylogenetic taxa present in infant stool suggest that bifidobacteria is able to efficiently overcome iron limitation as one of the mechanisms active in the gut.

using culture independent methods turroni et al.  <cit>  showed that a broad diversity of species were present in the gut of european infants. major bifidobacterial groups identified were b. breve, b. bifidum, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum and b. pseudolongum in agreement with our study. as shown in table  <dig>  the most frequently isolated species in the present study were b. breve, b. bifidum and b. longum which are bifidobacterial species highly encountered in breast fed infants. in addition, using culture dependent studies, turroni et al.  <cit>  and matsuki et al.  <cit>  showed that the most frequently isolated species in fecal samples from european infants were b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. breve, b. longum, respectively. this is in contrast to our study where b. animalis or b. catenulatum were not detected while b. kashiwanohense was isolated in three fecal samples, possibly reflecting species distribution between african and european infants, a bias resulting from the stringent iron limitation, or a non-identified species in previous studies. b. kashiwanohense has been reported for the first time from feces of a healthy japanese infant in  <dig> and is known to be close to b. pseudocatenulatum and b. catenulatum, that are species commonly found in the infantile gut  <cit> . in addition, b. kashiwanohense was only found in three samples which can be associated with an interindividual variability in species distribution which was previously shown for premature and term infants  <cit> .

iron is an essential micronutrient for most microorganisms and directly impacts the metabolism of microorganisms. functions regulated by iron in bacteria are those involved in iron utilization or acquisition and two transport systems have been described in iron uptake pathways  <cit> . bacteria secrete iron scavenging compounds, siderophores, to fulfill their iron requirement for growth. a high fraction  of bifidobacterial strains were in the high sa group, with b. breve exhibiting the highest siderophore activity. in addition, the major fraction of the strains exhibiting high sa belonged to the isolates from infants stool samples, which highlights the importance of testing new isolates for this property. previous studies demonstrated that bifidobacterial strains can inhibit competing organisms in an iron concentration dependant manner  <cit> . however, it was also recently reported that the growth of some bifidobacterial strains was not affected by the presence of iron chelators such as  <dig> -dipiridyl and 8-hydroxyquinoline  <cit> . although different attempts have been done to identify iron sequestration mechanisms no study demonstrated the production of iron scavenging compounds in culture supernatant. production of iron scavenging compounds is a common strategy to compete in environments where iron is limited and activation of this mechanism could represent an advantage for bifidobacteria in the presence of competing bacteria of the gut microbiota.

bifidobacterial strains were characterized towards iron internalization which is a potential mechanism to scavenge iron and to provide competition. interestingly, b. kashiwanohense showed the highest ii activity suggesting that b. kashiwanohense has efficient sequestration systems that may play a role in competing for iron in the intestine  <cit> . thus, the efficient iron uptake systems of bifidobacteria, such as production of iron scavenging compounds and iron internalization, may be important from the point of view of nutritional immunity  <cit> .

despite high sa in b. breve species and ii in b. kashiwanohense species were identified, standard deviation within each species group was very high, reflecting a remarkably strain specificity towards sa and ii. different sa and ii properties between species and strains enable the selection of strains with the highest iron sequestration activities with possible competitive advantage when competing in the iron limited intestine. no correlation was found between siderophore activity and iron internalization  implicating that these two properties are independently controlled, in agreement with previously reported studies where the two properties were not related  <cit> . in our study sixteen out of twenty strains that showed high sa and ii are strains isolated from iron deficient infant stools. four strains exhibited both high sa and ii characteristics: b. pseudolongum pv8- <dig>  b. kashiwanohense pv20- <dig>  b. bifidum pv28-2a, b. longum pv5- <dig> . the mechanisms involved in iron acquisition have been shown to play an important role during enteric infection  <cit> . it has been recognized that most of the dominant colonizers of an environment have efficient iron scavenging systems and can inhibit the growth of other competing organisms by depriving them from iron  <cit> . herein, selected strains could be further tested for the utilization of iron sequestration mechanisms for host protection in complex gut ecosystems where mechanisms involved in iron competition have been addressed to play an important role  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a wide diversity of bifidobacterial strains with high iron sequestration properties were obtained from fecal samples of iron deficient kenyan infants in a culture dependent approach targeting low iron environments. bifidobacterial species from public culture collections and newly isolated strains were characterized for siderophore production in culture supernatant and iron internalization which enabled the selection of four strains isolated from infant stools with high iron sequestration mechanisms. the implication of an efficient utilization of iron sequestration mechanisms by selected bifidobacteria strains to inhibit enteric pathogens could be further tested in complex gut ecosystems and may uncover one of the mechanisms of bifidobacteria for host protection against infection.
