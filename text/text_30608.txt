BACKGROUND
growing concern over the increase in multidrug resistant bacteria has urged the interest for development of new types and classes of antimicrobial compounds. one such class is antimicrobial peptides , also known as host defence peptides, that are found in all multicellular organisms and form an important part of the innate immune system  <cit> . they exhibit antimicrobial activity against a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms, have immune-modulatory effects and enhance the host defence against pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . amps are usually small cationic and amphiphatic peptides comprised of less than  <dig> amino acids with immense diversity in sequence, secondary structure motifs, charge and/or the abundance of certain specific amino acids  <cit> . their ability to selectively kill prokaryotic rather than eukaryotic cells, make them promising candidates for drug development. however, one drawback of most natural amps as therapeutics is their susceptibility to proteolytic degradation  <cit> . to overcome this problem an approach known as peptidomimetics has emerged in recent years by which compounds are produced that mimic a peptide structure and/or function but carries a modified backbone and/or non-natural amino acids. the peptide-mimetic compounds have been designed based on essential biophysical characteristics of amps: charge, hydrophobicity, and amphiphatic organization  <cit> . oligomeric n-substituted glycines, also known as peptoids, belong to the simpler amp-mimetic designs. they are structurally similar to α-amino peptides, but the side chain is shifted to amide nitrogen instead of the α-carbon  <cit> . this feature offers several advantages including protease stability  <cit> , and easy synthesis by the submonomer approach  <cit> .

previously, a study screening  <dig> lysine-peptoid hybrids identified a hybrid displaying good antimicrobial activity toward a wide range of clinically relevant bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus , in addition to low cytotoxicity to mammalian cells  <cit> . the lysine-peptoid hybrid lp <dig>  contains the peptoid core ---n-glycin amide and  <dig> lysines   <cit> . lp <dig> is thus potentially interesting as a lead structure in the development of new antimicrobials functioning against pathogens like s. aureus which are increasingly becoming resistant toward conventional antibiotics  <cit> .

due to their cationic and amphiphatic nature, it is believed that most amps selectively kill bacteria by penetrating the negatively charged cell membrane leading to membrane disintegration. however, during the last two decades it has become apparent that some amps may also act by other mechanisms without destruction of the cell membrane, namely, acting on intracellular targets leading to inhibition of enzymatic activities, cell wall synthesis and rna, dna and protein synthesis  <cit> .

the inhibition of rna, dna and protein synthesis in bacteria is often the result of amps interacting with dna  <cit> . additionally, interaction with dna by the hexapeptide wrwycr and its d-enantiomers was shown to interfere with dna repair  <cit> . dna repair damage elicits the sos response that is a conserved pathway essential for dna repair and restart of stalled or collapsed replication forks, regulated by the repressor lexa and the activator reca  <cit> .

in this study, we set out to investigate the mode of action  of lp <dig> using the pathogenic bacterium s. aureus. collectively, our data suggest that lp <dig> has a dual mode of action; at mic values it is able to bind dna leading to inhibition of dna biosynthesis, inhibition of the function of topoisomerase iv  and dna gyrase and induction of the sos response through reca. however, when using concentrations above the mic, lp <dig> targets the bacterial membrane leading to disruption of the bacterial membrane.

RESULTS
determination of mic of lp <dig> against s. aureus
given that the lysine-peptoid lp <dig> has antimicrobial activity toward a number of bacterial and fungal pathogens, we investigated how lp <dig> interacts with and affects the pathogenic bacterium s. aureus. we tested the mic of lp <dig> against two s. aureus strains, 8325– <dig>  a laboratory strain of human origin  <cit> , and the clinically relevant community acquired strain usa <dig>  <cit> . mic was in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> μg/ml for both strains.

permeabilization of the s. aureus membrane by lp <dig> is concentration dependent
many amps interact with the bacterial membrane, leading to pore-formation and subsequently leakage of intracellular components  <cit> . therefore, to determine whether lp <dig> influences s. aureus membrane structure, we investigated membrane integrity by measuring atp leakage. we found that increasing concentrations of lp <dig> added to s. aureus 8325– <dig> at time-point  <dig>  lead to a gradual increase in atp leakage from the cells . the addition of  <dig> μg/ml of lp <dig> most likely resulted in an abrupt destruction of the bacterial membrane, since no intracellular atp was detectable and an immediate increase in extracellular atp was detected. however, at low concentrations of lp <dig> only limited leakage of atp was observed, showing that the leakage of atp is concentration dependent. thus, in this experiment we find that lp <dig> targets the membrane at high concentrations whereas little effect on the membrane was seen at low concentrations.

these observations agree well with the killing kinetics of lp <dig> against s. aureus . here, we performed dose-dependent time-kill assays at two concentrations representing 1 × mic and 5 × mic . lp <dig> reduced the colony forming unit  counts by  <dig> log units during the first  <dig> min of the experiment at 5 × mic. thereafter, the killing rate gradually decreased and after the  <dig> h time course approached a total reduction of cfu count by  <dig> log units. at 1 × mic lp <dig> did not reduce the cfu within the  <dig> h of exposure  and the exposed bacteria resumed growth when transferred to media without lp <dig> . thus, at this concentration lp <dig> does not to kill s. aureus, instead it prevents growth, indicating that lp <dig> does not affect the cell membrane but rather has an intracellular target. this notion is supported by the finding that concentrations several fold above the mic is needed to see atp leakage. some amps can cause small membrane lesions, which lead to transient leakage of protons and thereby depletion of intracellular atp, which would affect synthesis of cellular molecules  <cit> . however, from our atp leakage experiment, it is clear that the intracellular level of atp does not decrease, until high concentrations of lp <dig> are used and increased atp leakage is observed .

amps have previously been suggested to have multiple targets, including both intracellular targets and the membrane, depending on the concentration of the amp  <cit> . indolicidin and the peptidomimetic oligo-acyl-lysine  c12k-2β <dig>  induce membrane damage at magnitudes above their mics, whereas around their mics they were both found to have intracellular targets  <cit> .

lp <dig> inhibits macromolecular synthesis of dna and binds dna in vitro
amps can affect the synthesis of macromolecules  <cit>  and since lp <dig> is likely to have an intracellular target, we investigated its effect on dna synthesis. we assessed the ability of s. aureus to incorporate radiolabeled thymidine into dna after exposure to concentrations of lp <dig> at either 1 × mic or 5 × mic. the incorporation was monitored over a time period of  <dig> min and the dna synthesis was clearly inhibited within the first  <dig> min after addition of lp <dig> at both 1 × mic and 5 × mic .

previously it has been shown that the inhibition of dna synthesis by amps is associated with their dna binding  <cit> . therefore, to clarify whether lp <dig> inhibits dna synthesis by binding to bacterial dna, a gel retardation assay was performed. as shown in figure  <dig>  gel retardation with plasmid dna demonstrated that in the absence of lp <dig> prmc <dig> migrates as a plasmid. however, upon the addition of increasing concentrations of lp <dig>  the prmc <dig> plasmid was no longer able to migrate into the gel. this suggests that lp <dig> interacts with plasmid dna and inhibits the migration of plasmid dna. from the gel retardation assay we observed that at lp <dig> concentrations well below the mic value  lp <dig> interferes with the migration of plasmid dna and at  <dig> μg/ml lp <dig> the plasmid dna was altered to such an extent that it no longer entered the gel. dna binding is not a general property of amps, since another peptide, plectasin, did not bind to plasmid dna in the same experiment . the ability of amps containing peptoid residues to translocate across lipid bilayers and bind to bacterial dna has been shown for klw-l <dig> a containing two nala   <cit> . however, whether this is a general moa of peptoids still needs to be elucidated. collectively, these observations strongly support our hypothesis that lp <dig> exert its moa intracellularly by binding to dna and inhibiting dna synthesis.

lp <dig> inhibits dna gyrase and topo iv and induces the sos response through the reca gene
since lp <dig> inhibits dna synthesis and binds dna we speculated that the dna replication machinery was affected by lp <dig>  some of the main players of bacterial dna replication are the type ii topoisomerases, dna gyrase and topo iv. dna gyrase is responsible for the removal of positive supercoils in front of the advancing replication fork, whereas topo iv decatenates the precatenanes behind the replication fork  <cit> . to investigate if the activity of these enzymes is influenced by lp <dig> in vitro, supercoiling and decatenation assays were performed using s. aureus dna gyrase and topo iv, respectively. the supercoiling and decatenation activity of s. aureus dna gyrase and topo iv was measured in the presence of various concentrations of lp <dig> with ciprofloxacin used as a positive control  <cit> .

lp <dig> was inhibitory on both s. aureus dna gyrase and topo iv in that the enzymes were unable to supercoil or decatenate dna, respectively . this suggests that lp <dig> interferes with the activity of both enzymes. however, because we found that lp <dig> binds to dna, the observed inhibition of the dna gyrase and topo iv is likely due to the inaccessibility of the enzymes to bind to dna and exert their function possibly leading to stalled replication forks.

stalling of replication forks often lead to induction of the sos response in bacteria  <cit> . the ability to induce the sos response was determined by visualizing the β-galactosidase synthesis from a reca-lacz fusion using an agar diffusion assay  <cit>  . the result clearly demonstrated an induction of the expression of reca in vitro by lp <dig> monitored as a blue ring at the point of bacterial growth ). ciprofloxacin was used as a positive control as it is known to induce reca expression in s. aureus )  <cit>  and h2o was used as a negative control . the ability to induce the sos response was shown recently for the hexapeptide wrwycr that exerts its broad bactericidal activity by inducing the sos response through stalling of bacterial replications forks  <cit> .

to our knowledge these results show for the first time that a peptoid is able to bind dna, induce the sos response and interfere with the functions of dna gyrase and topo iv.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we propose a model in which lp <dig> exerts a dual moa. at 1 × mic the lysine-peptoid hybrid traverses the cytoplasmic membrane of s. aureus without causing lethal damage and binds the chromosomal dna, inhibits topo iv and dna gyrase and thereby the replication machinery by blocking the accessibility to dna. the inhibitory effect on dna replication induces the sos response leading to inhibition of growth. at concentrations of 5 × mic and above, lp <dig> also targets the cell membrane leading to leakage of intracellular compounds like atp, resulting in cell death. these results add new information about the moa of a new synthetic peptide, and advance our knowledge of these compounds as potential antimicrobial therapeutics.
