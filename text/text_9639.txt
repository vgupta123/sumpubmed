BACKGROUND
the phenylpropanoid pathway gives rise to a variety of compounds that are used in the biosynthesis of cinnamic acid derivatives, lignin, flavonoids and condensed tannins. these phenolic compounds form a diverse group of secondary metabolites, exhibiting numerous biological functions in plants. in the betula species, the phenolic compound concentrations vary according to the development phase of the plant  <cit> , clone  <cit>  or plant part  <cit>  and to different environmental factors  <cit> . moreover, tannins and specific flavonoids have been shown to play a role in defence against herbivory  <cit>  and protection against uvb radiation  <cit> . in addition to the phenolic compound profiles of different betula species, the general outline of the phenylpropanoid pathway of the species is also well known  <cit> .

the secondary cell wall is essential for the conduction of water and the structural integrity of vascular plants as well as for defence against insect herbivores and pathogens. the secondary cell wall is composed of multiple layers of cellulose microfibrils embedded in a matrix of hemicellulose, lignin and pectin. lignin, probably the most studied phenolic compound, is composed of monomers derived from the monolignol biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . in hardwoods, coniferyl, sinapyl and p-coumaryl alcohol are the main lignin monomers, giving rise to guaiacyl , syringyl  and p-hydroxyphenyl  phenylpropanoid units, respectively, when polymerized to the lignin molecule. these hydroxycinnamyl alcohols differ in their degree of methylation and, consequently, form varying linkage types in the lignin, determining the solubility of the polymer. in sinapyl alcohol, the c- <dig> position of the aromatic ring is methylated, which prevents the formation of strong linkage types that are typical for g units. angiosperm lignin consists mainly of g and s monomers and is more easily delignified than the g unit rich gymnosperm lignin. the monolignol biosynthetic pathway is still under debate, partly because the enzymes involved in the pathway are multifunctional and exhibit broad substrate specificity, at least in vitro, making several alternative reaction orders possible. the most updated view of the angiosperm monolignol biosynthetic pathway is presented by li et al.  <cit> , do et al.  <cit>  and vanholme et al.  <cit> .

the caffeate/5-hydroxyferulate o-methyltransferase  , also known as 5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde o-methyltransferase   <cit>  catalyses the methylation of the c- <dig> position of angiosperms' s precursors. comt belongs to the plant class ii o-methyltransferases  together with enzymes that methylate numerous phenolic compounds, such as phenylpropenes and flavonols  <cit> . initially comt was shown to use caffeic acid and 5-hydroxyferulate as substrates  <cit> , but further studies demonstrated that comt is especially involved in the biosynthesis of s lignin  <cit>  and, furthermore, that the methylation occurs at 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde and  5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol as shown with various angiosperm species  <cit> . however, the substrate preferences of comt may vary between species being, for instance, relatively board in alfalfa   <cit>  and wheat   <cit> . some of the enzymes having comt activity are probably bifunctional as in the case of arabidopsis thaliana omt  which is involved in both lignin and flavonoid biosynthesis  <cit> .

silver birch  is one of the key species in boreal forest ecosystems and, in addition, economically the most important deciduous tree species in nordic countries. in finland, based on the national forest inventory performed during years  <dig> through  <dig> approximately 16% of growing stock was birch   <cit> . the birch roundwood is used as a raw material in the chemical pulp industry but also in plywood production. moreover, birch is an important source of energywood: in  <dig> wood-based fuels covered one fifth  of the total energy consumption in finland  <cit> .

boreal forest trees live in a mutualistic association with ectomycorrhizal  fungi, which enables growth in the nutrient-poor, acidic soils. the formation of ecm symbiosis causes changes in the transcription levels of both partners  <cit> , resulting in morphological and physiological alterations. the proliferation of root hairs is inhibited and the epidermal cells of feeder roots in angiosperms elongate radially as the fungus penetrates into the intercellular space of the epidermis. the fungal hyphae that cover feeder roots are also a source of an external hyphal net. these distinctive alterations in the symbiotic partners ensure the effective exchange of water and nutrients from the fungal partner to the carbohydrates of the plant  <cit> . ecm formation has also been observed to alter the expression levels of genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway  <cit>  and the concentrations of phenolic compounds  <cit> . however, the results have been rather inconsistent.

transgenic plants have great potential for future agriculture, silviculture and biofuel production. increasing the pest and disease resistance of plants as well as improving wood quality and enhancing wood production have been the targets of both conventional breeding and genetic engineering. from an industrial point of view, lignin quality and content are of particular interest. the removal of lignin in chemical pulping is a costly process which could be facilitated with more soluble lignin and lower lignin content  <cit> . a reduction in lignin content would also be beneficial for the production of bioethanol  <cit> . other processes related to the production of bioethanol could also be enhanced by modifications in the cell wall chemistry, as reviewed by sticklen  <cit> . lignin modifications using various gene constructs that are associated with the monolignol biosynthetic route have been conducted successfully on angiosperm tree species .

changes in the primary as well as in the secondary metabolism of organisms are triggered by a variety of stimuli, such as changes in the developmental phase or environmental factors. therefore, the pleiotropic or non-target effects of transgenes should also be studied in diverse environmental conditions. so far, only minor changes have been found in interactions between lignin modified trees and herbivores or soil microfauna  <cit> . recent studies investigating possible changes in the secondary metabolism that are caused by genetic transformations have mostly been conducted on herbaceous species  <cit>  and without the involvement of ecological interactions. in the present study, we analyzed the phenolic compounds and lignin characteristics of ptcomt silver birch lines  in interaction with the ecm fungus paxillus involutus  in order to determine the impact of the symbiosis on the phenylpropanoid route derived compounds and to detect possible unintended effects of transgene expression.

RESULTS
expression of ptcomt and bpcomt in roots
the open reading frame of putative comt  and partial sequence  of pp2a  of silver birch were sequenced. the putative bpcomt was 72% identical to ptcomt  at the nucleotide level and 87% identical at the amino acid level  and showed highest similarity to the castor bean  comt   and almond  comt  . the putative bppp2a showed 91% similarity with medicago sativa subsp. x varia  and 90% similarity with a. thaliana  pp2a at the amino acid level . the expression of ptcomt and the putative bpcomt was studied from the non-inoculated and mycorrhizal roots of silver birch . the relative expression of the putative bpcomt was similar in both non-inoculated and mycorrhizal roots: 35s-ptcomt lines  <dig> and  <dig> had lower average levels of bpcomt transcripts than ubb1-ptcomt line  <dig> and clone a . however, significant differences  in the relative expression of bpcomt were only observed in the non-inoculated roots between ubb1-ptcomt line  <dig> and 35s-ptcomt line  <dig>  the relative expression of ptcomt was significantly  higher in the non-inoculated roots of 35s-ptcomt line  <dig> than in line  <dig>  where the transgene was driven by the ubb <dig> promoter . in mycorrhizal roots, the relative expression levels of ptcomt between lines were comparable to those of non-inoculated roots.

lignin distribution and composition
lignin content as a percentage of dry weight  evaluated with the acetyl bromide method was  <dig> % in the non-inoculated and  <dig> % in the mycorrhizal roots of clone a. in ptcomt lines the root lignin content varied between the highest value of  <dig> % of mycorrhizal roots of line  <dig> and the lowest of  <dig> % of mycorrhizal roots of line  <dig>  the corresponding lignin contents of stem wood were more than  <dig> percentage units lower than the root lignin contents and varied between  <dig>  and  <dig> %. neither the transgene nor the fungal treatment affected the lignin content. the gc-ms analyses of lignin units showed that the non-inoculated clone a had higher  s/g ratios in both stem and root wood than the non-inoculated plants of ptcomt line  <dig> . in non-inoculated roots of ptcomt line  <dig> the s/g ratio was lower  than in the roots of clone a. the s/g ratio of stem and root wood of mycorrhizal ptcomt line  <dig> was significantly reduced  in comparison with the mycorrhizal clone a. in the stem and root wood of both non-inoculated and mycorrhizal ptcomt line  <dig>  the s/g ratios were at the same level as in clone a. moreover, in the stem and root wood of non-inoculated ptcomt line  <dig>  the s/g ratios were significantly  higher than in the corresponding non-inoculated ptcomt lines  <dig> and  <dig>  according to the m√§ule assay the s lignin  was only slightly reduced when the root and stem xylem sections of ptcomt lines  <dig>  and  <dig>  were compared to the xylem sections of clone a  and ptcomt line  <dig> .

soluble phenolic compounds and condensed tannins
no clone- or line-specific peaks were detected in the hplc-dad or hplc-ms chromatograms and, moreover, all phenolic compounds were present in the non-inoculated and mycorrhizal samples of clone a and ptcomt lines . acetylated kaempherol, myricetin and quercetin with rhamnoside moiety were found in all leaves of clone a and ptcomt lines. condensed tannin concentrations were high in the samples . the tannin levels partly prevented the identification of soluble phenolic components, especially from the root samples .

in the leaves of mycorrhizal plants, significant differences  were found in the concentrations of quercetin 3-arabinose and kaempherol 3-acetyl-glucoside between ptcomt lines  <dig> and  <dig> . significant differences between clone a and the ptcomt lines were found in the concentration of p-oh-cinnamic acid derivates, individual cinnamic acid derivatives  <dig> and  <dig> and chlorogenic acid and chlorogenic acid derivative. a significant difference  was detected in the amount of -catechin in the leaves of the mycorrhizal and non-inoculated plants of clone a.

in stems, the cinnamic acid derivatives were at a higher  level in clone a than in ptcomt lines  <dig> and  <dig> . of individual components, the concentration of p-oh-cinnamic acid glucoside was higher  in the stems of the clone a than in the stems of ptcomt lines  <dig> and  <dig> . significant differences were also detected between the ptcomt lines and clone a in the concentrations of gallocatechin,  <dig> '-dihydroxypropiophenone 3-glucoside  and -catechin, which was at a higher level in the stems of clone a than in the stems of ptcomt lines.

the concentration of condensed tannin precursors was significantly  higher in the mycorrhizal roots of line  <dig> than in the roots of lines  <dig> and  <dig> . a small amount of ellagic acid was found in ptcomt lines  <dig> and  <dig>  where the ptcomt was driven by the 35s promoter, but not in lines  <dig> and clone a . an ellagic acid derivative was also found in line  <dig> and in the mycorrhizal roots of clone a.

formation of ecms and growth characteristics of silver birches
all ptcomt lines were able to form ecm symbiosis with p. involutus, and inoculation resulted in slightly higher survival percentages in clone a and ptcomt lines  <dig> and  <dig> . the mycorrhizal percentages of inoculated plants varied considerably between ptcomt lines and clone a. no differences were detected in the number of ecms per root systems  or in the morphology of the mycorrhizas between lines: well-developed hyphal mantle covered the root tips and the epidermal cells were radially elongated and surrounded by fungal hartig net . compared with the fresh weights  of the ptcomt-modified lines, plants of clone a had lower fws, but the growth rate  of the clone a plants in both treatments corresponded to the growth of the transgenic lines . inoculation of ptcomt-modified lines with p. involutus enhanced their growth, resulting in significantly  higher fws than that of the non-inoculated plants . the root/shoot ratios of plants increased significantly  as a result of inoculation in clone a and ptcomt line  <dig>  inoculation had no effect on the number or length of adventitious roots.

discussion
in the present study, no changes were found in phenolic compounds of ptcomt-modified silver birch lines that would have been caused by the formation of ecm symbiosis with p. involutus. the only difference between the mycorrhizal and non-inoculated plants was observed in the catechin concentration in the leaves of the non-transgenic clone a. m√ºnzenberger et al.  <cit>  observed a reduction in various phenolic compounds  in the mycorrhizal fine roots of european larch  and norway spruce  when compared with the non-mycorrhizal roots. similar results were obtained with european beech  ecm roots which contained less catechin  <cit> . by contrast, an increase in catechin concentration was detected in the ecm roots of european larch  <cit>  and the needles and stems of mycorrhizal scots pine   <cit> . furthermore, enhanced levels of phenolic compounds have been observed in douglas-fir   <cit>  and brown barrel   <cit> . the discrepancy of results may reflect the fluctuation of transcriptome patterns during ecm formation, as seen in various microarray experiments  <cit> , diverse biological material and experimental designs. in the present work, all ptcomt lines were able to form symbiosis with morphologically normal ecms. moreover, the mycorrhizal interaction increased fws in all ptcomt lines. similar results have been obtained with silver birches expressing sugar beet chitinase iv  <cit>  and 4-coumarate: coenzyme a ligase   <cit>  and ptcomt  <cit> . in all of these studies, transgenic silver birches were capable of forming ecm symbiosis although 4cl expressing silver birches had changes in their growth characteristics  <cit>  and two ptcomt silver birch lines had altered ecm morphology in vitro  <cit> .

in silver birch-p. involutus interaction, feugey et al.  <cit>  observed a transient increase in phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  activity, but in the micro-array studies  <cit> ¬†
pal was not differentially expressed in ecm roots compared with non-inoculated roots. instead, le qu√©r√© et al.  <cit>  found an increase in genes coding monolignol biosynthesis route associated products: arabidopsis caffeoyl-coa 3-o-methyltransferase  homolog, dirigent protein homolog and sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase  homolog. ccoaomt expression was consistent after  <dig> days of inoculation to  <dig> days, whereas the expression of dirigent protein homolog and sad homolog was at its highest after  <dig> days of inoculation and then again  <dig> days after the start of the co-cultivation. our results indicate that ecm formation had no drastic effect on the lignin or the phenolic compound biosynthesis in stems or roots.

the expression of ptcomt under control of the 35s promoter resulted in lower s/g ratios in the stem and root wood when compared with clone a, as observed in previous studies  <cit> . by contrast, when ptcomt was under the ubb <dig> promoter, no changes were detected in the lignin characteristics. we have previously shown  <cit>  that there are multiple copies of the ptcomt gene in lines  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and that the ubb1-ptcomt-transcript is bigger than the 35s-ptcomt-transcript. in the present study, the relative expression of the heterologous ptcomt seemed to be higher in the roots of 35s-ptcomt lines  <dig> and  <dig> than in those of ubb1-ptcomt line  <dig>  conversely, the bpcomt mrna transcript levels were more decreased in 35s-ptcomt lines  <dig> and  <dig> than in ubb1-ptcomt-line  <dig>  the homology between bpcomt and ptcomt at the nucleotide level was quite high and it is therefore possible that the heterologous ptcomt expression resulted in rnai-mediated partial silencing of the endogenous bpcomt. the relative expression levels of bpcomt and ptcomt possibly indicate that the 35s promoter generated a higher number of mrna transcripts of ptcomt than ubb <dig> and, as a consequence, decreased the number of bpcomt transcripts more intensively in 35s-ptcomt lines  <dig> and  <dig>  thus causing a reduction in the lignin s/g ratio.

the monolignol biosynthetic pathway crosstalks with other cell wall associated pathways  <cit>  and also with the biosynthetic pathways of various phenolic compounds  <cit>  which share the same precursors. consequently, the altered expression of monolignol biosynthetic pathway genes may result in changes in the lignin content and phenolic compound profiles as shown with suppressed comt and ccoaomt   <cit> , cinnamoyl-coa reductase   <cit> , hydroxycinnamoyl-coa shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase   <cit>  and cinnamate 4-hydroxylase   <cit> . in the present study, chemical changes were detected between the ptcomt lines and the non-transgenic clone a in the concentrations of phenolic compounds in the roots, stems and leaves of both non-inoculated and mycorrhizal plants. the detected changes were probably not direct results of the transgene because 35s-ptcomt lines  <dig> and  <dig> displayed differences in phenolic compound profiles. furthermore, the changes in the phenolic profiles of leaves, stems and roots are within the natural variation of phenolic compounds within silver birch  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, the down-regulation of bpcomt in the 35s-ptcomt lines caused no shift of monolignol pathway intermediates to the biosynthesis of the phenolic secondary compounds. moreover, no apparent effect in the composition or quantity of phenolic compounds caused by the expression of ptcomt under the 35s or ubb <dig> promoter could be found. to conclude, our results indicate that the present lignin modification in the ptcomt lines does not affect phenolic profiles or the symbiotic relationship between silver birch and p. involutus.
