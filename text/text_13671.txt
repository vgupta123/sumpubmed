BACKGROUND
transcription regulation networks are largely made up of recurring regulatory patterns called network motifs  <cit> . these network motifs have been demonstrated to carry out specific information-processing functions . one of the simplest and most abundant network motifs is negative auto-regulation . in this motif, a transcription factor  negatively regulates the promoter of its own gene or operon  <cit>  . approximately 40% of the known transcription factors in escherichia coli show negative auto-regulation  <cit> , as do many transcription factors in yeast and higher organisms  <cit> .

nar has been suggested experimentally and theoretically to have several functions. the first is increased homeostasis or buffering of the auto-regulated gene product concentration against stochastic noise  <cit> . because protein levels can vary from cell to cell by tens of percents  <cit> , such a noise buffering mechanism is useful in cases where precision in tf levels is needed  <cit> . low frequency noise in tf production rates tends to be buffered by nar because negative feedback reduces tf levels if they are too high, and increases them if they are too low, making tf levels more uniform across cells.

a second feature of nar is its ability to speed the response time of gene circuits  <cit> . response time is defined as the time it takes to reach half of the total change in a dynamic process. theoretical comparison between nar and a simply regulated promoter with no nar, with parameters in which both reach the same steady-state level expression, shows that the response time is shorter when the tf is negatively auto-regulated. this speed up is achieved by the use of a strong promoter allowing a rapid initial rise in tf levels, up to its auto-repression threshold, followed by reduction in production rate due to nar  <cit> . this speedup feature was observed in a synthetic nar circuit  <cit>  as well as in the native sos dna repair system of e. coli  <cit> . speedup offered by nar may be advantageous in dynamic environments where rapid responses improve fitness.

recently, it was shown by nevozhay et al. that nar can also linearize dose responses  <cit> . in this study the response of synthetic, tetr-based transcriptional circuits with and without nar was studied in s. cerevisiae as a function of inducer  levels. nar was found to transform a sigmoid induction curve into a more linear curve . this feature was also suggested in theoretical studies  <cit> . this role of nar can be interpreted as an increase in the input dynamic range - the range of input signals over which the system can respond.

such theoretical and synthetic-circuit studies are a powerful approach because one can study the function of circuits such as nar without of interfering effects. in natural systems, however, this motif is embedded inside a large regulatory network with many other interactions. these additional interactions might in principle modify its function. therefore, to fully test the function of a motif requires, in addition to theory and synthetic circuits, experiments on the motif in its natural context, wired into the full interaction networks of the cell.

here, we study the function of the nar motif in a natural system. we chose one of the best-studied gene regulation systems, the arabinose utilization system of e. coli. this system has been characterized over the past decades by schleif and colleagues . the arabinose-responsive tf, called arac, is negatively autoregulated . we asked whether nar increases the input dynamic range in this system.

the arabinose system is composed of  <dig> genes arranged in  <dig> operons: arac- the system-specific tf; arae, arafgh, araj- the arabinose transporters  <cit> ; and arabad- arabinose catabolic enzymes. two operons, arac and arabad, are divergent and share the same regulatory region . the system is regulated by camp receptor protein  and arac , which are activated by camp and l-arabinose respectively  <cit> . arac represses its own promoter, creating a nar motif. it both activates and represses the arabinose utilization operon arabad by means of a dna looping mechanism  <cit> . arac undergoes a conformational change when it binds l-arabinose, leading to expression of the ara genes. the system includes several interactions and feedback loops, in which metabolic enzymes and transporters downstream of arac affect the level of intracellular arabinose, the inducer that activates arac . in a study of the input functions of e. coli sugar systems, it was recently found that promoters from the arabinose system respond to their inducer with a wider input dynamic range compared to other sugar systems  in which the tf is not negatively auto-regulated  <cit> .

to test the role of nar, we compared the wild type ara system  to a variant in which nar is disrupted by placing the regulator arac under a constitutive promoter . we find, using high-temporal resolution measurement of promoter activity, that disrupting nar in the arabinose system increases the steepness of the sigmoidal response curve. it reduces the input dynamic range by about an order of magnitude. thus, nar increases input dynamic range in the context of the natural ara system. we also analyze this mathematically, suggesting that the increase in input dynamic range is due to the increase of arac protein level with increasing arabinose due to the nar.

RESULTS
the native input function of the arabad promoter has a broad input dynamic range
the input dynamic range is defined as the range of inputs over which the output changes significantly. operationally, following goldbeter and koshland  <cit> , we define the input dynamic range as the ratio r of input levels at which the system shows 90% and 10% of its maximal output . for a hill curve with coefficient n, the input dynamic range is r = 811/n. thus, michaelis-menten like curves with n =  <dig> show r =  <dig>  steeper sigmoidal curves with n =  <dig> show r =  <dig>  and very steep cooperative curves with n =  <dig> show r =  <dig> 

in order to determine the input dynamic range of e. coli promoters we used a fluorescent reporter automated assay  <cit> , with strains from the comprehensive e. coli transcription reporter library  <cit> . each strain bears a low-copy plasmid with a green fluorescent protein gene under the control of a full length copy of the promoter of interest. in this study we used reporters for the arabad and arac promoters in e. coli strain mg <dig> .

reporter strains were grown on glucose minimal medium containing saturating amount of camp  and increasing amounts of l-arabinose  <cit> . promoter activity  was defined as the rate of gfp production per od  unit, pa = dgfp/dt/od . the input functions were derived from the promoter activity averaged over a window that spans 1- <dig> cell generations in exponential phase . over this time window, promoter activity was constant to a good approximation .

the promoter activity of the arabad in the parental strain  as a function of arabinose concentration is shown in figure 3a. at low arabinose levels  the fluorescence of the reporter is indistinguishable from the cells auto-fluorescence background. the input function reaches 10% of its maximal value at arabinose levels of about  <dig>  mm, and 90% of its maximal value at about  <dig> mm. fitting a hill curve to the input function results in an apparent hill coefficient of n =  <dig> ±  <dig>  , and halfway induction point of k =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm . the input dynamic range is r =  <dig> ±  <dig> . these results are similar to measurements of the input function of the arabad reporter strain in wild-type mg <dig>   <cit> , and are consistent with the expected value for a curve with hill coefficient equal to n =  <dig>  in which r =  <dig> 

the arac gene is induced by arabinose
we also tested the dependence of the arac promoter activity on arabinose. since arac negatively regulates its own promoter, arabinose is expected to affect arac expression. indeed, using an arac reporter strain , we find that arabinose increases the activity of the arac promoter in a dose-dependent manner   <cit> .

disruption of negative auto-regulation of arac reduces the input dynamic range of arabad
to study the role of the negative auto-regulation of arac on the input dynamic range of its downstream genes, we decoupled arac expression from its negative auto-regulation . for this purpose we deleted the arac open reading frame from the chromosome of the wild-type strain mg <dig> and re-introduced arac on a plasmid  which provides constitutive expression . the plasmid has a tetr controlled promoter, repressed by a chromosomal tetr gene. without induction, this plasmid produces levels of arac that are comparable to the induced wild-type arac level, as assessed from the maximal promoter activity of the arabad reporter. it should be noted that the parental strain in this study  also contains chromosomal tetr as well as an emptly pze <dig> vector, in order to preserve genotypic identity between the two strains.

we find that in the absence of nar, the arabinose-dependent input function of arabad is significantly steeper than the parental input function , with an apparent hill coefficient of n =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , and halfway induction point of k =  <dig> ±  <dig>  mm . the measured input dynamic range spans between  <dig> mm -  <dig> mm, and thus has r =  <dig> ±  <dig> , in comparison to r =  <dig> ±  <dig>  in the parental strain. thus, decoupling arac from its negative auto-regulation reduces the input dynamic-range of its downstream genes by about an order of magnitude.

a model of nar and increased input dynamic range
what is the main effect at play that allows negative auto-regulation to increase input dynamic range? to understand this, we analyzed a mathematical model of the nar motif. we sought to make the model as simple as possible, in order to be able to understand it intuitively, and at the same time not too simple so as not to lose the essence of the problem. a more comprehensive model, based on mass-action kinetics, which includes a dual transcription factor that acts as both a repressor and an activator, is given in additional file  <dig> .

consider a transcription factor whose concentration is x, that binds its inducer s with a dissociation constant ks. the amount of x bound to s, which is the active form of the transcription factor x*, is described by michaelis-menten binding:   

the active transcription factor x* binds the promoter of a downstream gene z with michaelis-menten-like kinetics, so that the steady-state level of the z gene product is:   

where kz is the dissociation constant of x* from the promoter of z, βz is the maximal production rate of z, and α is its degradation/dilution rate  <cit> .

without negative auto-regulation, the concentration of x is independent of the inducer levels. we denote this constant level x <dig>  using eq.  in eq.  with x = x <dig> results in a sigmoidal regulation function with an input dynamic range of r =  <dig>    

it is at this point that negative auto-regulation has an important effect: instead of a constitutive level of x, negative auto-regulation allows the signal s to modify the concentration of x, an effect termed direct coupling  <cit> . with negative auto-regulation of the type found in the ara system, the promoter that encodes x is repressed by free x,  a repression which is relieved when x is bound to the signal.

to analyze this, consider the rate of production of x that is repressed by xf  <cit> , balanced by degradation/dilution of the protein at rate α, so that:   

where kx is the dissociation constant of x from its own promoter, and the free x  is given by the unbound fraction, xf = x-x*:   

substituting eq.  into eq.  and assuming strong binding of the regulator to its own promoter kx<<xf, one finds that at steady-state the level of x increases as the square root of the input signal s:   

where a <dig> = kxβx/α. in other words, the transcription factor  levels increases with the signal  levels .

using this expression for x instead of x <dig> in eq. , results in an input-function that is less steep, because of the square-root dependence of x on s:   

where . this function has an input dynamic range of r =  <dig>  which is  <dig> fold wider than that of eq. . thus, nar increases the input dynamic range.

note that the assumption kx<<xf is not crucial for the increased input dynamic range, and was used only for the sake of simplicity. in additional file  <dig> we present a full mass-action model, without these assumptions, and show that the present considerations apply as well.

we further investigated the effect of nar on input functions with different cooperativity in the binding of the tf to the promoter, as described by hill equations. in the present system, the arabad input function without nar has an apparent hill coefficient of about  <dig>  suggesting that the arac regulator is cooperative with n =  <dig>  in figure  <dig> we describe the results of the model with regulators with degrees of apparent cooperativity of the regulator ranging between n =  <dig> and n =  <dig>  it is seen that nar increases the input dynamics range in all cases. for example, at n =  <dig>  the input dynamic range without nar is r =  <dig>  but can reach up to r ~  <dig> with nar .

furthermore, the model explains how the change in regulator levels caused by nar can cause a shift in the halfway induction point k of downstream genes . the direction and size of the shift depends on the mode of regulation. for repressors, k generally increases with regulator levels, whereas activators show the converse dependence. since arac both activates and represses arabad, the detailed model in additional file  <dig> explains the observed increase in k shown in figure  <dig> .

to summarize the conclusions of this analysis, negative auto-regulation causes regulator levels to increase with inducer level. this enhances the input dynamic range by extending the range of inputs that can affect the downstream genes.

discussion
this study supports a role for negative auto-regulation in increasing the input dynamic range of downstream genes. previous studies suggested this role theoretically  <cit>  and demonstrated it using synthetic circuits  <cit> . here we tested nar in the context of a natural system, the arabinose system of e. coli, in which nar is embedded within multiple feedback loops and regulatory interactions. disruption of the nar in the arabinose system reduced the input dynamic range by an order of magnitude.

what is the intuitive explanation for the enhancement of the input dynamic range provided by negative auto-regulation? negative auto-regulation in the arabinose system allows the transcription factor concentration to be modulated by its own input signal. as the concentration of input signal increases, the concentration of transcription factor also increases. this extends the response range of downstream promoters, which would otherwise reach maximal activity when the transcription factor becomes saturated with input signal.

a related but distinct feature was studied by m. savageau  <cit> , in which proper coupling of inducer levels and transcription factor levels can increase the output  dynamic range of genes: the ratio of their maximal to minimal expression level.

use of nar to increase input dynamic range might be especially useful for regulators that bind the promoter cooperatively. such cooperative binding is thought to increase specificity  <cit> . however, a well-known feature of cooperative binding  is a narrow input dynamic range  <cit> . nar is a simple way to provide wide input dynamic range, while maintaining cooperativity at the level of regulator binding. the combination of cooperativity and negative auto-regulation might thus provide a response across several decades of input strength and at the same time remains specific.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study adds to our understanding of the functions of negative auto-regulation network motif, showing that it can increase the input dynamic range of the response, even when embedded in a relatively complicated native gene circuit. integration of negative auto-regulation within a system with high cooperativity , enables the system to respond to a wide range of input signal  while maintaining the system's specificity to the signal. this function can be experimentally tested in the numerous additional gene systems which bear this network motif across organisms. because the negative auto-regulation motif is not limited to transcription networks this feature might also apply to other biological systems including protein-level interactions.
