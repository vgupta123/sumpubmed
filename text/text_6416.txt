BACKGROUND
genome changes including point mutations, duplications, and recombination with homologous and heterologous dna are the driving force of evolution. bacteria, the most diverse and adapted types of cells in the biosphere, have permanently been evolving during millions of years to survive different environmental changes. comparative genomics is a very powerful tool to analyze bacterial evolution occurring over short periods of time  <cit> . moreover, whole genome resequencing of evolved escherichia coli strains using simultaneously two different methodologies has recently been reported. this strategy is certainly very useful for understanding bacterial evolution, such as pathogen emergence, adaptation to environmental perturbations or during fermentation events used to generate derivative strains with enhanced industrial capacities  <cit> .

we have constructed and characterized escherichia coli strains that lack the phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system , by deletion of the ptsh, ptsi, and crr genes, which is the major bacterial component involved in glucose transport and its phosphorylation. one of these strains, pb <dig>  in spite of growing very slow in glucose  =  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  h- <dig> as compared to the parental strain jm101), accumulates high amounts of phosphoenolpyruvate, which can be diverted to the synthesis of aromatic compounds. pts deletion results in a carbon stress response when the pb <dig> strain is grown in glucose as the sole carbon source that induces carbon scavenging. strains lacking pts can co-utilize several carbon sources due to the lack of catabolite repression exerted by pts, and their glycolytic flux is reduced as part of a carbon limitation response  <cit> . as a metabolic engineering strategy, an adaptive laboratory evolution process for the selection of faster growing derivatives of the pb <dig> strain was carried out in a fermentor in minimal medium with glucose as the sole carbon source. in this process, after entering the stationary phase this carbohydrate was fed by progressively increasing the dilution rate. the resulting strain, pb <dig>  which achieved a very reasonable growth rate , was selected in a process that lasted 120 hours    <cit> . the evolved pb <dig> strain that in the absence of pts uses the galactose permease , as the parental pb <dig> strain for glucose transport, has been utilized for overproduction of aromatic compounds  <cit> . 

it is well known that e. coli cells can adapt their metabolism to achieve higher growth rates as a result of specific mutations  <cit> . to get insights of the faster growth of the pb <dig> strain, we have compared its transcript levels with those of the parental pb <dig> strain, by reverse transcriptase quantitative real time pcr , of critical metabolic pathways. interestingly, we found that all glycolytic and several other central carbon metabolism genes, including those that code for the tricarboxylic acid  cycle enzymes, are overexpressed, suggesting a very efficient carbon utilization by the evolved strain  <cit> . we have previously shown that a mutation in the arcb gene could be responsible for the overexpression of the tca genes  <cit> . in addition a second mutation responsible of amber stop codon at position  <dig> in the rpos gene which codes for the sigma factor rpos, was detected in pb <dig> when compared against strain mg <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, to get a detailed knowledge at the molecular level, of all the different genetic changes that occurred in the pb <dig> strain, a complete genomic analysis is required. this information will allow a better understanding of the basis of growth adaptation, plasticity, and the physiology of this evolved e. coli strain, and also will be useful in the design of improved laboratory adaptive evolution and metabolic engineering strategies for enhancing carbon diversion into the aromatic pathway utilizing strains lacking pts.

in this work, using the roche nimblegen inc. comparative genome sequencing technique  and high throughput sequencing with illumina inc. gaiix, we identified all the genetic changes that occurred in the evolved pb <dig> strain during the selection process and analyzed and characterized the most relevant ones. results of the whole genome sequencing, supported by transcript quantification by rt-qpcr and by knockout inactivation of selected genes in the parental pb <dig> strain, indicate that a simultaneous deletion of several contiguous genes including rpph, muth and galr, is the main reason for the fast growth in glucose. galr codes for the repressor of the gal operon that includes galp that codes for the galp permease  <cit> , rpph codes for the rna pyrophosphohydrolase , which initiates mrna degradation  <cit> , while muth codes for the endonuclease of the muthls system involved in the mismatch dna repair system  <cit> . in addition, several non-synonymous point mutations were detected as one located in the rnase i coding gene rna, involved in the degradation of rna  <cit> , while others were located in known and in putative regulatory genes, such as arcb <cit> , bara <cit> rpod <cit> , rssa <cit>  and yjju <cit> . finally, other mutation was mapped on ypda, which code for a putative histidine kinase  <cit> .

RESULTS
detection and characterization of non-synonymous point mutations in the evolved pb <dig> strain
two comparative whole genome nucleotide sequence analyses of the evolved pb <dig>  its parental jm <dig>  and the wild type k- <dig> mg <dig> strains were performed. the first was carried out by roche nimblegen inc., madison, wi , using their cgs method; the second analysis was developed by winter genomics inc., mexico city , using illumina’s massively parallel sequencing technology . in the rn analysis,  <dig> non-synonymous point mutations were detected in structural genes;  <dig> of them were also mapped at the same positions by wg. in addition,  <dig> non-synonymous mutations were detected only by wg . since there was some discrepancies between the two technologies that utilized dna obtained from the original frozen stock of the pb <dig> strain , we decided to sequence each of the mutant genes solely reported by one company, after pcr amplification using the sanger methodology. only two of the mutants detected by wg  could be confirmed by sanger resequencing. the mutations in the other four genes  reported by wg and the five other genes  reported by rn , could not be confirmed by the sanger methodology . therefore, the total number of non-synonymous point mutations detected, comprised  <dig> reported by both companies, plus  <dig> additional mutations reported only by wg.  <dig> of the  <dig> common mutations including the ones located in regulatory genes , were confirmed by sanger resequencing . recently, it has been shown that when both types of methodologies were utilized simultaneously for whole genome resequencing of e. coli strains in which growth adaptations by evolution occurred, both techniques reported false positive mutations  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that the mutations in the pb <dig> strain not confirmed by the sanger methodology are false positives. however, since the muth gene deletion in this strain is responsible of increasing the mutation rate in e. coli <cit>  , it could be possible that the two non-synonymous mutations detected only by wg, and confirmed by sanger, are due to de novo changes that occurred in the overnight culture utilized to obtain dna for genome analysis by wg and not in the fermentation process started with the pb <dig> strain . alternatively, these two mutations could be real, but they were not detected by the rn analysis. importantly, the nucleotide sequence of the parental pb <dig> strain was also determined by wg . none of the point mutations that occurred in pb <dig> were detected in pb <dig>  indicating that they appeared in the laboratory adaptive evolution process. 

table 1a presents the  <dig> non synonymous point mutations in structural genes that changed the code for a different amino acid when compared to the parental pb <dig> and jm <dig> strains genomes. the asterisks in the table indicate the  <dig> non-synonymous point mutations detected by both roche nimblegen inc.  and winter genomics inc.  methods. in addition  <dig> synonymous point mutations in different genes were also detected . the regulatory and possible regulatory genes analyzed in this study are in bold letters. the mutations in these seven regulatory and possible regulatory genes and in seven additional genes were confirmed by the sanger methodology and are labeled with a +.  <dig>  point mutations in  <dig> genes were detected by rn,  <dig> of them were false positive.  <dig>  point mutations in  <dig> genes were detected by wg. in addition to the  <dig> mutations shared with rn, only two of these point mutations  were confirmed by the sanger methodology. additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  include the data from rn and wg. table 1b presents the absent genes in the largest deletion reported by both companies. . basic descriptions of these genes were taken from www.ecocyc.org.

among the non-synonymous substitutions detected some were located at genes with regulatory functions: arcb, bara, rpod, rna, and three in putative regulatory genes: yjju, rssa and ypda . the mutation in the arcb gene, a tyrosine to cysteine residue substitution at position  <dig> that apparently modifies the arca/b ability to function as a repressor, has previously been reported by our group. we have proposed that this modification could be responsible for the overexpression of the tca genes in the pb <dig> derivative as compared to the parental pb <dig> strain  <cit>  . a new role for this mutation is proposed .

the bara mutation resulted in a phenylalanine to leucine residue substitution at position  <dig> . this residue is located between two functional subregions of the hk domain of this protein; the “h box”, where the conserved histidine residue involved in the autophosphorylation of bara is located, and the “n box”, involved in atp binding  <cit> .

the change in the rpod gene resulted in a valine to isoleucine residue substitution at position  <dig>  which is located in a helix-turn-helix  motif of the rpod coded protein . this motif is involved in the binding to the − <dig> promoter region, but it is unlikely that the conservative nature of the substitution, and the fact that this residue does not make any direct contact with the dna  <cit> , had any significant effect on promoter recognition.

the mutation in the rna gene, an alanine to threonine residue substitution at position  <dig> of the coded rnase i, is also unlikely to have any consequence, since it is located in a nonconserved structural part outside the catalytic region  <cit> .

the yjju mutation resulted in a threonine to alanine residue substitution at position  <dig> in the coded yjju protein . it has been proposed that this protein could have a regulatory role  <cit> .

the mutation in the rssa gene resulted in an arginine to histidine residue substitution at position  <dig> of its product. the importance of this mutation, as well as the function of the rssa protein, are unknown; however, it might be functionally related to the rssb protein, which is involved in the degradation of the rpos, since both conserved proteins are coded by genes located in the same operon  <cit> . an esterase function has also been predicted for rssa .

the point mutation in the ypda gene located at position  <dig>  caused an alanine to serine residue substitution. this gene codes for a predicted sensory histidine kinase of the two-component system ypda-ypdb  <cit> .

the products of most of the other mutated genes  detected by both companies and the two mutations detected only by wg , are involved in bacterial metabolism and transport .

in addition,  <dig> synonymous mutations were reported;  <dig> of them detected by both companies. these mutations were not analyzed since it is unlikely that they could have any significant effect on the phenotype . also, several point mutations were detected in non-coding regions by wg. it should be noted that these unconfirmed mutations are unlikely to be located in regulatory regions .

the presence of a mutation in the rpos gene in the pb <dig> strain has been reported. this change generates a stop codon instead of a glutamine coding residue at position  <dig>  it is known, that this strain being a derivative of jm <dig>  carries a supe mutation, which suppresses amber stop codons  <cit> . originally this mutation was considered to have occurred during the adaptive evolution process since the change was detected when compared against the sequence of strain mg <dig>  <cit> . however, both comparative genome sequencing strategies showed that this mutation was already present in the parental pb <dig> and the jm <dig> strains. sanger resequencing confirmed the presence of this mutation in both of the parental strains . so, this mutation was incorporated at sometime during the development of the jm <dig> strain from its parental strains jc <dig>  csh <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> .

detection, characterization of a chromosomal deletion in the evolved pb <dig> strain, and analysis of the effects of the deleted genes
a deletion of  <dig>  bp located at minute  <dig> on the chromosome of the pb <dig> strain that removed simultaneously the rpph, ygdt, muth, ygdq, ygdr, tas, lplt, aas, omra, omrb, and the part of ptsp and galr genes, was detected by both rn and wg analyses . this deletion was confirmed by pcr  and its limits mapped within the ptsp and galr genes, resulting in a fusion of the remaining segments of these two genes . the nucleotide sequence of the fused fragments was confirmed by sanger and it is presented in additional file  <dig> . neither repeated sequences nor insertion sequences were detected in the chromosomal dna regions flanking the deleted genes; therefore, the molecular bases of this deletion are unknown.

the analyses of three of these genes, galr, muth and rpph whose deletion could be the main cause  of the faster growth in glucose of the evolved pb <dig> strain is presented and discussed in the following sections.

the galr gene codes for the repressor of the gal regulon that includes the galp gene  <cit> . therefore, the inactivation of this gene in the pb <dig> strain is apparently responsible for the high transcription levels of most of the gal genes. in agreement with this proposition, we have previously demonstrated that the pb <dig> strain that lacks pts is dependent on galp for glucose transport  <cit> .

the rpph gene codes for an rna pyrophosphohydrolase that initiates mrna degradation by hydrolysis of the 5’ triphosphate-end. after this modification, rnase e can initiate further mrna degradation. it has been reported that the level of  <dig> transcripts increased significantly in e. coli cells lacking rpph  <cit> . accordingly, in the pb <dig> strain higher transcript levels of many genes, among them glycolytic and tca genes were detected by rt-qpcr as compared to the parental jm <dig> and pb <dig> strains. we could not explain the basis of the simultaneous “overexpression” of the genes involved in these metabolic pathways   <cit> . in the light of the phenotype of the strains lacking rpph, it is likely that the higher levels of the transcripts observed in the pb <dig> strain is a result of impaired mrna degradation instead of overexpression . in fact, rpph inactivation in the pb11Δrpph strain increased its μ 261% . in agreement with this μ increment, as it will be presented in detail in the next sections, the rt-qpcr values of most central metabolic genes were increased  <dig> - to 18-fold when the rpph gene was inactivated in the pb11Δrpph derivative as compared to the parental pb <dig> strain, allowing an improved glucose metabolism, probably due to higher levels of central metabolic genes transcripts . interestingly, in contrast to the pb <dig> strain, inactivation of the rpph gene in the parental jm101Δrpph strain decreased 27% its μ , indicating that this mutation disrupted the glucose metabolism in this strain that does not have impaired the glucose transport. from these results it is tempting to speculate that inactivation of rpph could be considered as a tool for increasing the half-life of certain mrnas families, and therefore growth rates, in strains with certain limited growth conditions. 

*these values have been previously reported  <cit> .

the absence of the muth gene, which codes for the muth endonuclease that is part of the muthls complex involved in the dna mismatch repair pathway, is probably responsible for the appearance of the large number of mutations detected in the pb <dig> strain during the short term adaptive laboratory evolution process that lasted for only 120 hr  <cit> . it is known that the absence of the muth gene increases the mutation frequency in e. coli at least  <dig> fold  <cit> . in addition, starvation-induced mutagenesis among hundreds of e. coli natural isolates is increased on average 7-fold, but in certain strains up to 1000-fold  <cit> . the presented and analyzed information indicates that the  <dig> shared non-synonymous point mutations as well as the deletion are real mutations that appeared after a 120 hr period in this adaptive laboratory evolution process. a possible explanation for this high number of mutations is that the deletion of the muth, rpph and galr genes occurred early in the very short laboratory evolutionary process allowing faster growth by itself. in the absence of muth, some or several of the point mutations could then have occurred during a few replication cycles, favouring the selection of even faster growing variants in glucose. in addition, in this genetic background in which the pts deletion generates a carbon stress response, further mutagenesis induction is expected  <cit> .

rt-qpcr mrna expression values of relevant mutated genes and of central metabolic genes in the evolved pb <dig> strain
table  <dig> shows mrna expression values of relevant  mutated genes and of some other genes as controls determined by rt-qpcr . rt-qpcr values of more than  <dig> genes from the evolved pb <dig> strain, the parental pb <dig> and jm <dig> strains have previously been reported by our group, including the arcb gene in which a non-synonymous point mutation appeared, and are presented in table  <dig> for comparison and analyses purposes  <cit> . results indicate that the rt-qpcr values of some of the regulatory and possible regulatory genes were not substantially modified  with respect to the jm <dig> parental strain. as anticipated, except for galr, no transcripts of the  <dig> deleted contiguous genes were detected. 

relative mrna concentrations of central metabolism and regulatory genes of jm <dig>  pb <dig>  pb <dig> and their derivatives strains, grown in glucose as the sole carbon source, were determined by rt-qpcr. most of these values have previously been reported  and are presented here for discussion and comparison purposes  <cit> . arca/b regulated genes are marked with . data in this table are reported as relative expression levels of the parental jm <dig> strain, assigning it the value of one . the rt-qpcr values of mutated  or deleted  genes in the pb <dig> strain have not been reported, with the exception of arcb and rpos. n.d. not determinate.

inactivation of mutated regulatory and putative regulatory genes in the pb <dig> and pb <dig> strains. rt-qpcr values of carbon central metabolism genes of the pb11Δrpph strain
with the aim of understanding the possible roles of some of the regulatory and possible regulatory genes mutated in pb <dig>  as well as in its parental pb <dig> and jm <dig> strains , they were individually inactivated by a cassette insertion using the datsenko-wanner method  <cit>  , with the exceptions of the rpod gene, since its inactivation is lethal  <cit> , and the galr gene, since its regulated target, the galp gene, is already overexpressed in the pb <dig> and pb <dig> strains  <cit> . interestingly, as shown in table  <dig>  individual cassette inactivation of the arca, rpph, yjju, and rssa genes in the pb <dig> strain increased their specific growth rates in glucose as the only carbon source, supporting our hypothesis that the inactivation of some of these genes, especially rpph, was the result of direct selection during the evolution process for faster growth.

some of these regulatory genes were also inactivated by the datsenko-wanner method in the pb <dig> strain; the effects on their respective specific growth rate values are shown in table  <dig>  knockout inactivation of the bara, arca, and yjju genes decreased the μ by about 5%, 10%, and 23%, respectively, while no substantial growth rate difference were observed when the rna, rssa, or ypda genes were inactivated.

*this value has been previously reported  <cit> .

since the inactivation of the rpph gene in the pb11Δrpph strain is responsible for a markedly  μ increment, the expression of several genes, including carbon central metabolism, transport and regulators in this strain, as well as in the jm101Δrpph strain, were determined . in pb11Δrpph, most of the rt-qpcr values of the central metabolism genes, including tca , increased from 2- to 18-fold, as compared to pb <dig>  rt-qpcr values of all genes involved in growth under stress-limited carbon conditions, which most of them are overexpressed in the pb <dig> strain due to the lack of pts , were also high in the pb11Δrpph strain and, for some genes, the increase was up to 10-fold, as for the maeb gene   <cit> . the mrna levels of all these previously mentioned genes, except for aceef, fbaa, eno, pcka, pfka, pyka and pgk, in the pb11Δrpph strain were higher than in the parental jm <dig> strain. importantly, rt-qpcr values of several of these genes were also increased in the jm101Δrpph as compared to jm <dig>  but in general at lower level, with the exception of the gapa, pgi, glk, sdha, sdhb, and sucab genes, which increased more than 3-fold . the rt-qpcr values of some of the arca/b regulated genes were also highly increased in the pb11Δrpph . when comparing the rt-qpcr values of central metabolic genes in the pb11Δrpph strain with those of the pb <dig> strain, the tca cycle genes were reduced in the pb <dig> strain . the analysis and possible explanations of these differences is presented in the next section. remarkably, rt-qpcr values of most of the regulatory genes analyzed were also increased and, in some cases, highly increased in the pb11Δrpph derivative, as compared to the parental pb <dig>  whereas rt-qpcr values of most regulatory genes in the jm101Δrpph derivative were not substantially modified as compared to its parental jm <dig> strain.

as mentioned, higher rt-qpcr values of most of the genes in the pb11Δrpph derivative are mainly the result of the increase in the mrna half-life time due to the absence of rpph. however, since higher levels of most of the transcriptional regulators were detected in the pb11Δrpph strain, it is possible that the enhanced expression of some genes could be, in addition of increased mrna half-life time, the result of higher or lower expression of their regulatory genes.

analysis and possible effects of some of the mutated regulatory and putative regulatory genes in the evolved pb <dig> strain
it has previously been proposed that the point mutation in the arcb gene, detected in the pb <dig> strain, is apparently responsible for diminishing the arca/b function as a repressor, since it is known that inactivation of arcb or enhancing of its arca-p dephosphorylating activity, could contribute to the overexpression of arca/b regulated genes  <cit> . however, in order to explain the particularly higher mrna levels of most of the tca cycle and respiratory genes mainly controlled by arca/b in the pb11Δrpph strain, as compared to the pb <dig> strain , we now propose a different role for this arcb mutation. this mutation is apparently responsible for modifying the arca/b repressor function in the pb <dig> strain by reducing -not enhancing-, its arca-p dephosphorylating capacity, which in turn could contribute to higher repression of arca/b regulated genes, explaining the reduction in the rt-qpcr values of most of the genes regulated by the arca-p in pb <dig> as compared to the pb11Δrpph strain. therefore, this change in the arcb gene apparently reduced both, transcription of arca/b-dependent genes  <cit> , and metabolic burden, allowing better growth capacities to the pb <dig> strain as compared to the pb11Δrpph derivative . in agreement with this proposition, the knockout inactivation of the arca gene in the pb12Δarca strain reduced 10% the μ , because higher transcription levels of the arca/b-controlled genes resulted in this derivative  and this was probably sensed as metabolic burden. the same growth diminishing effect occurred in the jm101Δrpph strain, probably due to higher transcription levels of many central metabolism genes, including some of the tca cycle, which were apparently responsible for reducing 27% the μ , as compared to the parental jm <dig> strain. in agreement with the important role of the arca/b regulator, inactivation of arca in the pb11Δarca strain increase substantially the μ and the transcription levels of most of the arca/b-regulated genes as compared to pb <dig> strain  <cit>  . from these results, it is tempting to propose that inactivation of the arca gene in e. coli could be used as a tool for allowing better growth capabilities to cells growing aerobically in certain stress conditions, in which the lack of regulation of the tca cycle and respiratory genes would be an advantage  <cit> .

it has been proposed that yjju could be involved in regulatory processes  <cit> . the inactivation of yjju in the pb11Δyjju strain increased its μ from  <dig>  to  <dig>  h- <dig>  this 23% increment is not as high as the values obtained with the inactivation of arca  and rpph  . however, yjju inactivation in the pb12Δyjju strain reduced its μ 23% , as compared to the parental pb <dig> strain . these results suggest that if this protein really functions as a regulatory factor, as has been proposed, the point mutation could allow stronger capabilities to the cell for faster growth in glucose. cassette inactivation of yjju is the only case in which a gene knockout increased the μ in the pb11Δyjju derivative, and reduced the μ in the same percentage in the pb12Δyjju derivative. this mutation has to be investigated further, initially analyzing the transcription pattern of critical genes in the strain pb12Δyjju as compared to the parental pb <dig> 

the mutation in the rpod gene is responsible of a conserved valine  <dig> to isoleucine substitution located in the hth motif of region  <dig>  of rpod that is involved in the recognition of the − <dig> promoter region. in the co-crystal structure of region  <dig>  of thermus aquaticus with promoter dna, which is almost identical to the e. coli, this position is located at the turn of the hth motif and does not make any direct contact with the dna  <cit> . thus, it is likely that this particular substitution does not affect the affinity of this sigma subunit for the promoter dna sequences.

since the knockout inactivation of the bara, rssa, rna and ypda genes did not modify substantially the μ in the pb <dig> and pb <dig> derivatives, it appears that these genes played minor or not role at all in the growth recovery observed in the evolved strain.

CONCLUSIONS
we propose that the deletion event that simultaneously removed the muth, rpph, and part of the galr genes, mainly responsible for the faster growth  in glucose, occurred as one of the initial events in the adaptive laboratory evolution process which resulted in the evolved pb <dig> strain. this deletion caused simultaneously: a) a very high mutagenesis rate due to the removal of muth, in a strain lacking pts that is already responsible of a carbon stress response, b) higher glucose transport, by increased levels of galp in this strain lacking pts, due to the inactivation of galr <cit> , and c) higher mrna levels resulting in enhanced glycolytic and tca fluxes and better respiratory capacity to the precursor of the pb <dig> strain due to the absence of rpph.

in addition, lower mrna levels of most of the arca/b regulated genes were detected in the pb <dig> strain as compared to the pb11Δrpph derivative. this can be explained as an enhanced arca-p repressor capacity due to the arcb mutation that apparently appeared after the deletion of the rpph gene in the evolved strain, allowing lower levels of transcription of arca/b-regulated genes.

knockout inactivation of the bara, rssa, rna and ypda genes in the pb <dig> and in pb <dig> strains did not modify substantially the μ of the derivatives, suggesting that each of these mutations alone apparently played minor or no roles at all in the growth recovery in the evolved strain. some of these changes could in fact be neutral mutations  <cit> .

from these considerations, the evidences indicate that the main reasons for fast growth on glucose are apparently the deletion of the rpph, galr, and muth genes and, perhaps, the point mutation in the arcb gene. these two changes could have been fixed in a short period of time during the fermentation process. nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that other point mutation, as those in the yjju, or in the bara genes that have not been completely characterized in this study, could also play a minor role in the growth recovery in glucose.

in this study, as in others  <cit> , we used two different whole genome sequencing strategies which produced slightly different results. true changes had to be discerned from false positives by conventional sanger sequencing. therefore, it is important to emphasize the relevance of using more than one genome resequencing method for this type of studies to have high confidence in the results.

finally, the results presented here show the physiological plasticity of e. coli and could be useful in the design of more robust adaptive laboratory evolution strategies.
