BACKGROUND
high-throughput methods for structural genomics have produced an increasing number of protein structures to be solved by x-ray crystallography. the abundance of protein structure information in the protein data bank  has increased the need and desire for structure-based function prediction  <cit>  and has contributed to structure-based drug design  <cit> . however, two problems remain regarding the prediction of enzyme function. first, proteins within a superfamily, which are usually expected to share the same catalytic properties, can catalyze different reactions. there are reports that enzymes with 98% sequence identity, such as melamine deaminase and atrazine chlorohydrolase, may catalyze different reactions  <cit> . second, two enzymes belonging to different superfamilies or fold classes can catalyze almost identical reactions  <cit> .

the function of a protein can be affected by a small number of residues in a localized region of its three-dimensional structure  <cit> . moreover, the specific arrangement and conformation of these residues can be crucial to a protein’s function and may be strongly conserved during its evolution, even when the protein sequence and structure change significantly  <cit> . for example, it was reported that the positioning of the reactive region of a substrate with respect to a cofactor is generally conserved in flavoenzymes  <cit> .

two methods for the description of local structures have been developed for predicting enzymatic functions. first, in the element-based description of catalytic residues, the catalytic roles in an enzymatic reaction are defined as acid–base, stabilizer or modulator roles  <cit> . some insight into enzymatic reactions can be gained using this method, but manual annotation is inherently required. in addition, it is often difficult to differentiate between the acid–base and stabilizer roles because most structures solved by x-ray crystallography provide no information about hydrogen atoms. the second method is based on descriptions of substructures within the local structures of enzymes  <cit> . many approaches to analyze and compare local structures have been proposed. one group of algorithms, which includes the pints  <cit> , eta  <cit>  and flora  <cit>  algorithms, scans protein structural databases using pre-calculated or automatically generated templates. another group includes algorithms that compare the substructural epitopes of proteins using geometric hashing  <cit> . similarly, siteengine  <cit>  uses the concept of pseudocenters  <cit>  to define the properties of the corresponding surface. none of these approaches can characterize catalytic sites and create feature vectors, even though they assess the similarity between catalytic sites.

in this study, we examine the structures of oxidoreductases and transferases using radial distribution functions  that encode radially distributed properties of active sites centered around the reacting points of bound ligands. thus, element-based and substructure descriptions are integrated into the rdf, assuming that catalytic roles are restricted by distances and that different catalytic residues can play identical roles. although the topological correlation vector method of stahl et al. <cit>  and wavegeomap, developed by kupas et al. <cit> , provide feature vectors related to enzyme cavities, these descriptions use patches of active sites, regardless of the orientation of the catalytic residues. therefore, it is still unclear whether the orientation of active sites around a reacting point is related to enzymatic function and how much of the orientation is conserved. our method provides a different view of enzymatic function by focusing on the physicochemical properties surrounding a reacting point found in enzyme cofactors.

RESULTS
characteristic physicochemical pattern of active sites
to examine how catalytic residues contribute to the radially distributed properties of active sites, we decomposed the rdf into the total charge for each residue. figure  <dig> shows the contributions made to the peaks and minima of the rdfs by the various catalytic residues surrounding the carbon atom  of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  molecule in 1dc <dig> and the iron atom  of the heme  molecule in 1sog . the first local minimum in 1dc <dig> corresponded to the nucleophilic cysteine residue and the asparagine residue that binds nad . the second local minimum and the last two minima were affected by the threonine residue that binds the substrate . the peak at 6 Å corresponded to the histidine residue that activates the thiol group of the cysteine residue and to the cysteine residue itself . the last two peaks were derived from the arginine residue that binds the substrate . all of these five residues in 1dc <dig> are known to be critical for the enzymatic reaction. the first peak in 1sog corresponded to the proximal histidine residue  and the distal histidine residue  . the subsequent minimum at  <dig>  Å was slightly affected by the histidine residues and the arginine residue  . the small peak at  <dig>  Å shown in figure 1b was derived from the tryptophan residue . we can show that all of the four residues described in 1sog also play an important role in the catalytic reaction. moreover, the degenerated total charge of the catalytic residues corresponded to the rdf with a range from  <dig> to 5 Å for both enzymes . the bias of the rdfs toward a negative charge may be due to ignoring hydrogen atoms. these results show that catalytic residues are primarily responsible for the physicochemical properties of active sites.

subsequently, to investigate whether the rdfs adequately discriminate between active sites, we selected pairs including the wild-type and a mutant form of the enzymes from the dataset. we then calculated the averaged euclidean distances or cosine distances  of matched pairs  and mismatched pairs  for each enzyme compared to the distance measure  obtained using siteengine . as shown in table  <dig>  most of the pairs were agglomerated within a euclidean distance of  <dig>  and the rdfs were successful in revealing their similarity. the pairs from mdh_ecoli were located approximately at a euclidean distance of  <dig> from each other; however, two identical mutants were reported to have different conformations   <cit> . long distances were observed between the mismatched pairs compared to those of the matched pairs . of the mismatched pairs, the ccpr_yeast proteins were particularly close to each other , and the rdfs failed to identify their dissimilarity. however, the conformation of the catalytic site in the ccpr_yeast protein is not altered by the mutation included in this analysis   <cit> . these results show that the euclidean distance between the rdfs reflects the conformational changes in the active sites. the match scores from siteengine were similar to the distances between the rdfs. although the distances between the rdfs were slightly poorer than the match scores in terms of the number of successful discriminations, the feature vector of the rdf is almost equivalent to the measure of siteengine in discriminating between the active sites. thus, the active sites are characterized based on the physicochemical patterns of the rdfs.

the w/w and m/m columns show wild-type/wild-type or mutant/mutant pairs. the w/m columns show wild-type/mutant pairs. the results with statistically significant differences between the match and mismatch are shown in bold font. the statistical significance was assessed by wilcoxon rank sum tests with a 5% significance level.

active site properties as the critical determinants of enzyme function
to investigate whether the rdfs account for a major part of the enzyme function, clustering of the rdfs was performed using a self-organizing map  approach. figure  <dig> shows the results for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  and cytochrome c peroxidase . the gapdh residues were mainly distributed in the area around node  <cit> , including the two different catalytic sites . within the gapdh distribution, 1 dc <dig> from escherichia coli and 1nq <dig> from bacillus stearothermophilus  were closely positioned at nodes  <cit>  and  <cit> , respectively. the only difference between the catalytic sites in this orthologous pair is the replacement of cysteine  <dig> with serine leading to a 104-fold reduction in dehydrogenase activity  <cit>  .

similarly, the ccp residues were mainly localized in the area around node  <cit> , including the two different catalytic sites . within the ccp distribution, 1sog and 1dso from saccharomyces cerevisiae  were positioned at nodes  <cit>  and  <cit> , respectively. in the active site of 1dso, histidine  <dig> is replaced by glycine . thus, the results show that the obtained clusters of enzymes consist of clusters of their catalytic sites, suggesting that the rdfs of active sites account for a major part of the enzyme function.

prediction of enzyme functions based on the physicochemical properties of active sites
in this study, we sought to identify functionally related enzymes by clustering active sites. first, we utilized the ec number for assignment of rdfs to analyze the som clustering. an overview of the som is summarized in additional files 1– <dig>  for additional file 1: tables s <dig>  additional file 2: table s <dig>  additional file 3: figure s <dig>  additional file 4: figure s <dig>  tables  <dig> and  <dig> show the division of the rdfs into nodes, each of which is labeled with its ec number. the partial rdfs labeled with the ec numbers indicated a well-defined segregation, discriminating among 76% of the ec numbers of oxidoreductases and among 55% of the ec numbers of transferases.

the numbers indicate the rdf counts assigned to the nodes, and the number of classes is shown in parentheses. the som was performed by the rdf with an epanechnikov neighborhood function in a  <cit> -sized rectangular lattice

*one class is more than 80% of the total. §the nodes were labeled using scop <cit> .

*one class is more than 80% of the total. §the nodes were labeled using scop <cit> .

then, to evaluate how many of the active sites are associated with enzyme functions, we performed a statistical analysis of the results of the som clustering. the averaged f-measure of all of the assigned ec numbers of oxidoreductases was  <dig> , ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . over 88% of the active sites of oxidoreductases were assigned to an ec number . similarly, the averaged f-measure of all of the assigned ec numbers of transferases was  <dig> , ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . over 88% of the active sites of transferases were assigned to an ec number .

prediction performance in comparison with sequence and structural alignment-based annotation
to clarify the contribution of the rdfs to the functional annotation of the enzymes, we examined the relationship of the rdfs with different measures, such as sequence and structural alignment. first, we performed statistical analyses of these measures. tables  <dig> and  <dig> show the partial correlation coefficients between the som distance, active site distance, local and global sequence similarities and structural similarity. the som distance among the rdfs was distinct from the other methods.

next, the som distances among the rdfs were evaluated for their ability to annotate enzyme function in datasets that had not been correlated with known functions by either structural or sequence alignments due to pairwise identities below 25%. tables  <dig> and  <dig> show the area under curve  values of the som distances for these datasets. in oxidoreductases, these values, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , represented higher performance compared to the values obtained using sequence and structural alignments . in transferases, the auc values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the datasets with pairwise identities below 15% also represented higher performance compared to the values obtained using sequence and structural alignments . these results showed that the som distance predicts enzyme function, even for enzymes with weak conventional similarities. moreover, the som distance outperformed the match score of the siteengine based on substructure.

*the datasets were created by culling the pairs with greater than 25% pairwise identity. the som was run using an rdf with an epanechnikov neighborhood function in a  <cit> -sized rectangular lattice.

*the datasets were created by culling the pairs with greater than 15% pairwise identity. the som was run using an rdf with a cut-gaussian neighborhood function in a  <cit> -sized rectangular lattice.

we then confirmed the ability of detecting enzymes with pairwise identities below 25%. while the eta detected  <dig> oxidoreductases and  <dig> transferases, the numbers of enzymes assigned to the nodes within the som distance of  <dig> nodes were  <dig> of oxidoreductases and  <dig> of transferases, suggesting that the coverage of the som detection was higher than that of the eta .

structural genomics prediction
to perform a blind validation for proteins with unknown function, we used the soms trained by oxidoreductases and transferases to predict enzyme functions of  <dig> proteins in structural genomics. while the coverage of the eta predictions was 31%, the som predictions covered 57% of the query structures . of the predicted ec numbers, the rates of validated prediction that the ec number is compatible with the bound ligands were 59% of the eta predictions and 72% of the som predictions, suggesting the som predictions provide a clue to annotate these functions .

the ec numbers compatible with the bound ligands are shown in bold font.

discussion
without using any templates, the rdfs centered around active sites are capable of clustering oxidoreductases and transferases based on their function. in this study, we applied our method only to the oxidoreductase and transferases classes of proteins. we focused on these classes for the following reasons. first, oxidoreductases exhibit a great variety of catalytic sites compared to other known classes, possibly because the redox potential is modulated by oxidoreductases. second, the reaction centers are well-defined in oxidoreductases and transferases, consisting of a substrate and cofactor that mechanistically exchange electrons and protons. the catalytic residues are generally capable of assisting in the migration of protons from the reaction center, a role that strongly resembles the roles of other enzyme classes. for example, caspase- <dig> is a hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolytic reaction of peptides; the cysteine residue nucleophilically attacks the substrate, which is followed by protonation of the histidine  <cit> . this mechanism closely resembles the catalytic behavior observed for gapdh, an oxidoreductase  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the pattern of the cys-his catalytic diad in 1bmq was similar to that in 1dc <dig>  the peak shift may be due to the different position between substrate and cofactor. these similarities suggest that our method can be applied to other enzymes to predict additional protein functions. to apply our method to other enzymes, the reaction centers will require manual annotation. reaction pairs published by kegg rpair  <cit>  that include candidate reaction centers are available for other enzymes and can be used for this purpose.

understanding the orientation of catalytic sites is important for drug design. for a given g protein-coupled receptor, there are several types of ligands, classified as conformational change inducers, agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists  <cit> . the rdfs describe the orientation of catalytic sites, detecting conformational changes as well as enzyme function . in addition, the description of the microenvironment produced by the rdf is better than simple superposition of catalytic sites when a particular functional group is not present .

in structural genomics, the rdfs would be advantageous for finding remote orthologs, especially when evolutionary pressure has enhanced sequence/structural divergence. although sequence-based methods are the first choice for functional annotation, proteins with sequence identities of < 20-35% are problematic  <cit> . measuring structural similarity is more informative for enzyme functions exhibiting distant relationships and/or convergent evolution. however, proteins within well-known superfamilies sharing the same structural topology, such as tim barrels, do not always have the same functions  <cit> . in these cases, the measure of structural similarity alone does not correspond to functional similarity. therefore, a specific measure representing functionality is desirable. we focused specifically on the local features around the catalytic site. compared to the structural alignment, the functional annotation was reinforced by focusing on the reaction center . it is also likely that convergent evolution of an enzyme function depend less on evolutional process than on physicochemical properties of active sites . for proteins with unknown function, 41% of query structures were newly classified into the ec numbers . however, the true performance of our method will be evaluated by revealing the actual function of those proteins. the combination of results obtained using different approaches will also improve the accuracy of function predictions.

CONCLUSIONS
we propose a novel classification method for the prediction of enzymatic function based on the physicochemical properties of catalytic sites. the rdfs for predicting enzymatic functions are thus far limited to enzymes with bound ligands. for ligand-unbound structures, either homology modeling or superposition based on ligand-bound structures can be applied to our method. our results suggest that the rdf provides a different perspective compared to structural and sequence alignments by focusing on a local feature because catalytic sites are thought to be more highly conserved than the overall sequences or structures of enzymes.
