BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a class of non-coding small rnas  that act to reduce expression of target genes by interacting with their target mrnas in a sequence-specific manner. since their discovery it has become clear that mirnas are an important component in the regulation of many genes in most eukaryotic cells. in plants, most currently validated mirna targets code for transcription factor families with crucial developmental functions, including the control of root and shoot architecture, vegetative to reproductive phase transitions and leaf and flower morphogenesis  <cit> .

mirnas are processed from a primary mirna transcript which folds to form an imperfect stem-loop. the pri-mirna hairpin is recognised and processed to a smrna duplex consisting of the mirna and complementary mirna* by a protein complex containing a dcl1-type rnase. the mature mirna, which is typically 20– <dig> nt in length, is then incorporated into the rna induced silencing complex  to regulate one or more target genes in trans through a base pairing mechanism. most plant mirnas appear to trigger both mrna cleavage  and translational repression of their target genes  <cit> . although these two mechanisms are additive, they can be dissociated when slicing activity is disabled by a mis-pairing in the central region between the mirna and its target  <cit> . in plants, the high level of complementarity between the mirnas and their targets suggests slicing is the predominant mode of action of mirnas  <cit> . alternatively, mirnas can regulate their target indirectly through the production of trans-acting short interfering rnas   <cit> . tasirnas are synthesised from a non-coding mrna that is processed to phased  <dig> nt smrnas by a mirna triggered process. like mirnas, tasirnas can regulate multiple target genes through a slicing mechanism.

the number of annotated mirnas in mirbase has exponentially increased in the last decade  <cit> . the earliest group of mirnas were identified in silico using algorithms to predict stem-loop precursors and targets present in the genome and/or est databases  <cit> . subsequent developments in high throughput sequencing made it possible to identify mirnas based on sequencing of smrna libraries in a wide range of species. schreiber et al. <cit>  identified  <dig> mirnas, including  <dig> new mirnas, from barley leaves using short-read sequence data. a major challenge of sequencing based approaches is to identify the mirnas amongst a smrna population mostly composed of short-interfering rnas   <cit> . distinguishing these two major smrna classes relies principally on identifying their origin. an sirna locus produces several overlapping sirnas, whereas the pri-mirna encoded by a mir gene usually produces one mirna from an imperfect rna hairpin  <cit> . additional criteria can also help classify a smrna, such as its length and mode of action. most mirnas and tasirnas are  <dig> nt in length and post-transcriptionally regulate their target genes in trans, whereas the vast majority of the  <dig> nt smrnas correspond to cis-acting sirnas  that regulate the transcription of their own locus of origin through a dna methylation based mechanism.

mirna targets are often validated using a modified 5’race technique to detect the products of mirna-mediated cleavage  <cit> . for most currently annotated mirna targets, cleavage has not been verified and therefore the function of the corresponding mirna in vivo has not been established. recently, techniques which combine 5’race and high throughput sequencing  and equivalent methods  <cit> ), have been used to simultaneously validate all sliced mirna targets in a given rna extract. such an approach has been successfully carried out in arabidopsis, rice, soybean, grapevine, citrus and medicago  <cit> . however, identifying a mirna regulation is dependent on examining the appropriate tissue and developmental stage. as mirnas are predominantly post-transcriptional regulators  <cit> , the impact of their regulation depends on the overlap of their spatio-temporal expression with that of their target genes  <cit> . mirnas from the same family can potentially have different functions depending on their expression profile, as suggested for members of the mir <dig> and mir <dig> families that differentially accumulate in response to abiotic stress in rice  <cit> .

despite the growing knowledge of mirna functions in plants, only the functions of highly conserved mirnas have been investigated in crop species. perhaps the best characterized mirnas in cereals are mir <dig> and mir <dig> which regulate spl  and ap2-like genes, respectively. mir <dig> controls shoot branching in rice and maize  <cit>  and mir <dig> regulates floral organ identity in rice, maize and barley  <cit> . in maize, mir <dig> accumulation is affected by mir <dig> and both mirnas are involved in the regulation of the juvenile to adult phase transition  <cit> . in contrast to the highly conserved mirnas, the majority of the newly discovered mirnas are weakly expressed and only found in closely related species, suggesting that they have recently evolved and could contribute to determining species-specific traits.

barley is the fourth most cultivated crop worldwide; its grains are used for both human consumption and livestock feed. from anthesis, it takes approximately 40 days to form a mature grain composed of  <dig> principal tissues: the embryo, the endosperm , and the outside layer . the development of the grain can be divided in three principal stages based on morphological changes, metabolite accumulation and transcriptome analysis: pre-storage, storage  and desiccation  <cit> . the pre-storage phase, which corresponds to the first  <dig> days post anthesis , is characterized by extensive mitotic activity in both embryo and endosperm. the transition to the storage phase, roughly between  <dig> and  <dig> dpa, can be considered as an intermediate stage characterized by dramatic transcriptional changes in order to mobilize energy resources and initiate the differentiation of the tissues that will constitute the mature grain. throughout the maturation phase, which lasts up to ~ <dig> dpa, aleurone and embryonic tissues acquire desiccation tolerance whereas the endosperm cells undergo endoreduplication and accumulate storage metabolites   <cit> .

in this study we investigated the mirna-mediated gene regulation that takes place during the growth of the barley grain. since the early stages of development play a key role in determining grain quality characteristics, we focused on the pre-storage and early storage phases . from analysis of smrna and degradome libraries,  <dig> genes regulated by mirna-mediated cleavage were identified including transcription factors, kinases, oxidoreductases, hydrolases, transferases, receptors and transporters. our data suggest that mirnas contribute widely to the control of development of the cereal grain, notably through the regulation of phytohormone response pathways.

RESULTS
the early development of the seed is marked by large-scale transcriptional changes, especially during the transitional phase. in order to correlate those changes with variation in mirna abundance, we made smrna and mrna-degradome libraries from the whole caryopsis at three consecutive developmental stages:  from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa ,  from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa , and  from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa . an overview of our analysis is presented figure  <dig>  we first used the smrna libraries to detect known mirnas and to identify new mirnas based on the presence of their precursor in cdna databases. we then used the degradome libraries to identify potential endonuclease cleavage sites in est sequences and selected those that could result from slicing by a sequenced smrna. the smrnas associated with a cleavage site in the degradome data are designated as potential mirnas .

diversity of the small-rna population in early grain development
approximately equal numbers of sequence reads  were generated from each of the smrna libraries . the size distribution in the smrna datasets was similar to previous reports with about 44 %  <dig> nt sequences that are likely to consist predominantly of casirnas and 7 %  <dig> nt smrnas that will include the bulk of the mirnas . the datasets showed a decrease in the percentage of  <dig> nt smrnas and an increase in the percentage of  <dig> nt smrnas from stages a to c, which correlates with data from developing rice grain samples from 1– <dig> dpa and 6– <dig> dpa  <cit> . if unique signatures are considered, both 21nt and  <dig> nt smrna diversity increased from stage a to b, suggesting a higher smrna complexity during the reprogramming phase of grain development. as the grain matures further , the number of unique  <dig> nt signatures decreases while the  <dig> nt increase . the continuing increase in  <dig> nt smrna diversity with development may reflect an increase in heterochromatin formation as cells become more differentiated. this correlates with the observation that undifferentiated cells have little heterochromatin and that epigenetic regulation plays an important role in the determination of cell fate through global remodelling and compaction of chromatin structure  <cit> .

number of sequences and signatures  for different length of smrnas found in smrna libraries made from whole caryopsis tissue at the three developmental stages: a , b  and c . singletons are the signatures found only once. the column “> <dig> rpm” shows the number of signatures with more than  <dig> read per million .

previously identified mirnas present in barley grain
we found  <dig> smrna signatures that were identical  to at least one previously identified plant mirna, representing  <dig> mirna families . of these,  <dig> families had been previously classified as hvu-mirna in mirbase and  <dig> were previously reported in barley leaves but not classified as hvu-mirna in mirbase  <cit> . we found  <dig> mirna families  that were not observed in barley leaf and so may be seed specific  <cit>  . as previously observed by colaiacovo et al.  <cit> , the vast majority of the mirnas are  <dig> nt in length . the specificity of each family was determined according to the farthest species  in which at least one member has been found. we note that the highly conserved families are not necessarily highly expressed in barley seed, examples are mir <dig> and mir <dig> which accumulate at less than  <dig> rpm. conversely, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> which have only been identified in barley, are expressed at over  <dig> rpm in the seed. overall only ~ <dig> % of the unique  <dig> nt signatures correspond to known mirnas.

to determine whether the number of cloned sequences in the libraries reflects the relative abundance of a smrna in planta, the accumulation of three known mirna families  was monitored during seed development . for all three families, the abundance of the mature mirna detected by northern blot between the three development stages followed the same trend as the numbers of reads in the libraries. therefore, the relative expression of each smrna between the  <dig> samples  can be directly inferred from the numbers of sequence reads.

new mirnas identified based on the presence of their precursor
a mirna can potentially evolve as a result of the transcription of one of the many inverted repeats present in the genome if the resulting hairpin structure has the features to be recognised and processed by a dcl protein. in the absence of a barley genome sequence, sequence information is restricted to est databases. for this analysis we used the harvest database which contains over  <dig>  unigenes and searched for mirna precursors corresponding to smrna sequences in our database . a putative precursor  was found for  <dig> smrna sequences. eight of these were for mirnas present in mirbase including the three highly conserved mirnas hvu-mir <dig>  hvu-mir171a and hvu-mir168a for which a mirna* was also present . there were also putative pri-mirnas for seven smrna sequences not present in mirbase . two of these have sequences closely related to known mirna families and were therefore annotated hvu-mir5071b and hvu-mir1120b. hvu-mir1120b  is a short version of hvu-mir <dig>  with  <dig> nucleotides missing at the 5’ end; both are predicted to originate from the same pri-mirna. since hvu-mir <dig> was only predicted in silico <cit>  and hasn’t been detected in barley leaves, it may not exist in planta. we temporarily annotated the other five smrnas as new mirnas starting from hvu-mir <dig> as they show the expected features of a mirna other than the presence of a mirna*. the lack of mirna* sequences may reflect the low abundance of these mirnas.

the pri-mirnas were identified in the harvest dataset according to their ability to form a hairpin-like secondary structure that could generate one of the smrnas present in the libraries. for each mirna, its length and number of reads  in each library  are indicated. the column “star” indicates when a corresponding mirna* was found in the libraries.

identification of potential mirna targets using the degradome libraries
the  <dig> known and  <dig> new mirnas identified in this study account for only 1 % of the unique  <dig> nt signatures in the smrna sequence dataset, suggesting that these analyses did not identify all the mirnas present. an alternative approach to identify the presence of a mirna is to detect its post-transcriptional regulatory activity on a target gene. in plants, most mirnas characterised to date show slicing activity on their target, hence degradome analysis was carried out using the parallel analysis of rna ends  technique  <cit> , constructing libraries from samples a, b and c as used for the smrna libraries . we reasoned that having smrna and degradome libraries from the same sets of samples would allow us to follow the mirna regulation of target genes and increase the likelihood of detecting a cleavage that occurs at a particular developmental stage.

approximately  <dig> million sequence tags corresponding to cleaved 5’ ends of mrnas were obtained from each of the degradome libraries . after trimming of adapter sequences, most sequences were of the expected size of  <dig> or  <dig> nt. to simplify analysis, the  <dig> nt sequences had the 3’ nucleotide trimmed and were then pooled with the  <dig> nt sequences giving  <dig>  million unique sequence tags . the number of unique sequences was higher in sample b which also had the greatest diversity of  <dig> nt smrnas . this suggests that there is a larger diversity of transcripts regulated by mirna cleavage between  <dig> and  <dig> dpa.

number of sequences and signatures  of mrna degradation products found in the degradome libraries made from whole caryopsis tissue at the three developmental stages a , b  and c . the 20– <dig> nt pooled degradome sequences combine the  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt sequences shortened to  <dig> nt by removing the 3’end nucleotide.

the degradome sequences were mapped to the harvest dataset. the total reads mapping to an est were used to establish a threshold which was calculated using the average number of reads of all degradome signatures matching the est plus two standard deviations. sequences that were more abundant than the threshold were considered to be degradome peaks . the degradome peak was then used to define a target signature sequence  which extended  <dig> nt in each direction from the 5’ end of the degradome sequence that identified the peak. the tsss were then compared to the known mirnas, the new mirnas and to the 19– <dig> nt smrnas filtered against repeat elements . the three degradome libraries were analysed separately. this identified  <dig> ests with at least one tss that was predicted to be a binding site for a known, new or one of the 19– <dig> nt sirnas. we refer to the 19– <dig> nt sirnas that match a tss as potential mirnas  from here on. as there is no precursor information for the pot-mirnas they could include tasirnas and other sirnas as well as genuine mirnas. the majority of the ests we identified had multiple degradome peaks. as the degradome libraries were made by reverse transcription from the polya + tail, a mirna target would be expected to have a peak corresponding to the mirna cleavage site, together with degradation products from downstream of the cleavage site. this prediction was observed for  <dig> out of  <dig> conserved targets of known mirnas . based on this observation, we selected  <dig> ests for which the first tss was predicted to be targeted by at least one mirna  that perfectly aligned with the predicted cleavage site  . these  <dig> ests included  <dig> with only one tss and were targeted by a total of  <dig> mirnas . most of the tsss were predicted to be targeted by multiple mirnas; some were aligned to the predicted cleavage site, while others aligned at positions without a corresponding degradome product . this last group of mirnas, which do not appear to cleave the mrna may be present in different tissues to the target mrna. another explanation could be that the precise position of the mirna binding site on the target mrna is critical for efficient cleavage by risc due to structural constraints. as the presence of multiple mirnas raises some doubt about the validity of the mrna target site, they were assigned to three groups . category i included the ests only targeted by mirnas with a perfect offset. category ii contains ests targeted by a majority of mirnas with a perfect offset. category-iii contains the ests where the aligning mirnas with a perfect offset were in the minority.

among the  <dig> potential mirna targets, we found  <dig> targets of known mirnas and three targets of new mirnas  . the cleavage of three targets of known mirnas was verified by rlm-5’race . the pot-mirnas identified in this analysis included many homologs of known mirna families that varied in sequence and length to previously identified sequences . in the absence of complete genomic sequence data it is not possible to determine whether these represent genuine additional family members or errors from library construction and sequencing. the presence of large numbers of these alternate length sequences for some mirna families suggests that there may be differential processing of the pri-mirnas or later processing of the terminal nucleotides.

the targets correspond to barley ests potentially regulated by mirna mediated cleavage. the categories refer to a level of confidence based on the distribution of the smrnas predicted to bind the target site . the known mirnas are those identified in previous studies, the new mirnas are smrnas for which we identified a pri-mirna and the pot-mirnas refer to the remaining set of 19– <dig> nt smrnas matching to a tss . note that targets of known and new mirnas may also be targeted by pot- mirnas.

the degradome analysis revealed that most mirnas target only one est with a smaller group targeting  <dig> to  <dig> different ests, which are usually members of the same gene family, . this is in contrast to an average of  <dig> ests bioinformatically predicted as targets for each mirna . one obvious reason for not detecting target mrna cleavage is that expression of the mirna and mrna may not overlap. published microarray data  <cit>  shows that a majority of the genes predicted to be regulated by a slicing mechanism are expressed during seed development  however this does not preclude the non-overlapping expression of mirna and target in the same cell types. in addition we found four sliced targets in our dataset that were predicted to be regulated through a translational repression mechanism only . our observations suggest that there are inadequacies in the algorithms currently used to predict mirna targets, hence experimental verification is required to confirm these predictions in planta.

mirna regulation during seed development
the early development of the grain is controlled by a complex interaction of signalling and gene regulation networks to allow the proper expansion and specialisation of the different tissues that will constitute the mature grain. based on our combined analysis of smrna and degradome data we identified  <dig> genes likely to be mirna regulated  during the first  <dig> dpa of seed development. using annotated sequences from barley, wheat, rice and arabidopsis, we found significant homology to an annotated gene for  <dig> of the mirna target genes. based on sequence homology these genes are predicted to encode a wide range of protein functions, including transcription factors, kinases, oxidoreductases, hydrolases, transferases, receptors and transporters . we performed an ontology analysis of these targets and compared it to a set of over  <dig> ests previously detected in the seed and annotated by sreenivasulu et al.   <cit> . enrichment of go terms was declared statistically significant if they met the criteria of p < =  <dig>  using a hypergeometric one-tailed test with correction for multiple testing . this analysis shows that in the barley grain, mirnas target a significantly higher percentage of genes annotated in the hormone signalling pathways, rna cellular processes  and energy mobilization categories.

using our data, the variation of mature mirna abundance was compared to that of the cognate degradation products across the three stages of grain development. the detection of mrna cleavage products indicates that the expression domains of the mirna and target gene are at least partially overlapping. the more the mirna and its target are expressed, the more degradation products should be generated. the following paragraphs highlight what we think are the more interesting data based on the function of the targets. since it is impossible to distinguish which one of the mirnas  are present and functional in the same tissue as the target, all mirnas with zero offset to the cleavage site were considered. the number of distinct mirnas and the sum of their reads for each library is summarised in table  <dig>  as noted above, related mirnas tend to have similar expression profiles and thus the sum of their reads is a good indication of their individual expression patterns.

list of  <dig> of the  <dig> potential mirna targets identified in this study. the left part of the table shows ests predicted to be regulated through mirna-mediated cleavage, their category of confidence , and their associated function according to homology with the closest annotated gene from one of the following species : hordeum vulgare , triticum aestivum , oriza sativa  or arabidopsis thaliana . genes are arranged by functional group indicated by the headings in the closest homolog column. the middle part of the table shows the number  of smrnas matching the target with a perfect offset, the sum of their reads  in each library and to which family they belong . the right part shows the number of degradome sequences  resulting from the cleavage. the grey boxes indicate when the number of reads was significantly higher than the threshold.

cell differentiation
perhaps the best known function of the mirna pathway is to control the cell fate through the regulation of transcription factor coding genes. we validated  <dig> conserved targets of six known mirna families which code for transcription factors known to control key steps in plant development: mir156-spl , mir159-myb, mir164-nac, mir167-arf , mir169-cbf  and mir172-ap2like . we also found evidence for mirna regulation of the dof  plant specific transcription factor family. its expression seems to be restricted to the early development of the grain since degradation products were observed only during stage a . dofs are plant specific transcription factors known to play a critical role in growth and development  <cit> . in maize and finger millet, dof proteins are thought to be involved in carbon metabolism and the accumulation of storage proteins  <cit> . in rice, rpbf  which contains a dof domain, was shown to be involved in the regulation of endosperm expressed genes  <cit> .

energy mobilization
the early development of the seed is associated with an elevated metabolic activity limited by energetic resources. photosynthesis related genes are mainly expressed during the first  <dig> dpa within the pericarp tissue  <cit> . four of the potential mirna targets  are likely to be involved in chloroplast function. an est coding for a pglct  homolog is also cleaved by a pot-mirna during the early development of the grain. pglct is involved in the export of stored starch into the cytoplasm at night  <cit> . the level of pglct degradation products in our dataset increases during grain development  which correlates with a previous observation in rice that expression of a pglct homolog gene increases in the endosperm during the first  <dig> dpa  <cit> .

signalling pathways
the control of seed development involves a cross-talk between three key phytohormones: aba, ga and auxin, which are tightly linked to the master regulators lec1/afl  that govern many seed-specific traits, such as embryogenesis, grain filling, desiccation tolerance, and dormancy induction  <cit> .

auxin concentration together with other local factors, contributes to cell differentiation and specification of cell fate  <cit>  and is known to be involved in embryo patterning  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the auxin signal is tightly linked to the mirna pathway, with four conserved mirna families  regulating the auxin receptor tir <dig>  and different subgroups of arf  genes  <cit> . we identified a tir <dig> homolog and  <dig> arf genes potentially regulated by mirnas and tasirnas during seed development . our data shows that in the barley grain the regulation of tir <dig> and potentially  <dig> arf genes  by the mir <dig> and mir <dig> families is conserved. we noticed that hvu-mir167a and d, which are the highest expressed members in this family, show a reciprocal accumulation pattern which could suggest they are expressed in different tissues where they differentially regulate the same target genes . we also identified smrnas homologous to the tasir-arfs which regulate four arfs . the accumulation of these smrnas correlates with hvu-mir <dig> which gradually decreases in abundance from stage a to c , suggesting that, as in arabidopsis, the production of the tasir-arfs requires mir390-mediated cleavage.

the antagonistic role of ga and aba in the control of the switch between dormancy and germination is a well known mechanism; however the function of these hormones during the early stages of seed development remains unclear. our data suggest that there is mirna regulation of aba and ga signalling during the early stages of grain development, with degradome analysis identifying two aba-insensitive homolog genes , a ga3oxidase <dig> and a homolog of the ga receptor gid <dig>  as targets of mirnas or pot-mirnas . abi <dig> is cleaved with a perfect offset by  <dig> members of the grass specific mirna family hvu-mir <dig>  degradation products of abi <dig> only accumulate during stage c whereas the corresponding mirnas are expressed earlier. in contrast, the cleavage of gid <dig> mostly occurs during early stages while the cognate pot-mirnas accumulate in later stages. this suggests that in both cases the mirnas could act to prevent leakage in target gene expression, ensuring that gid <dig> function is restricted to early stages and abi <dig> to later stages. these data support the current belief that ga is required during early embryogenesis but its function is repressed in later phases when a higher aba/ga balance is needed for the proper maturation of the grain. this also correlates with the observation that the late presence of ga may inhibit embryogenic cell differentiation  <cit> .

our data also suggest that there is mirna regulation of ethylene responses with an acc oxidase homolog cleaved by a pot-mirna during the early maturation phase. along with aba, ethylene is thought to play a major role in the development of the endosperm by affecting grain filling and the timing of programmed cell death   <cit> .

defence response
plants recognize many pathogens through the action of a diverse family of r genes, whose protein products are necessary for the direct or indirect recognition of pathogen avirulence  proteins in order to initiate the defence response. in addition to their role in defence responses, r genes may be involved in the regulation of developmental processes in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> .

in barley, the r gene mla <dig> acts as a receptor of fungal infection by recognising avirulence proteins and confers resistance against the powdery mildew fungus  <cit> . in wheat the expression of several mirnas is responsive to powdery mildew infection, suggesting that the mirna pathway could be involved in triggering the defence response  <cit> . our degradome analysis indicates that two hvmla genes homologous to the rice mla <dig> and mla <dig> genes are cleaved by mirnas or pot-mirnas .

further investigation of osmla10-like and ga3oxidase <dig> regulation
the impact of regulation by a mirna depends on the relative spatio-temporal accumulation of the mirna and the target mrna. in this study, we focused on investigating mirna regulation at three consecutive stages of grain development. since the tissues that will constitute the mature grain are not formed during the early stages, we used the whole caryopsis to be able to compare the abundance of the mature mirnas and the degradation of their targets between the samples. consequently, further investigation of the function of a mirna cleavage identified in our analysis requires further assessment of the tissue specificity of both mirna and target mrna expression.

to illustrate this, the regulation of two category-i targets, osmla10-like and ga3oxidase <dig>  and their associated mirnas was investigated. the abundance of both mirnas and targets were quantified in embryo, endosperm and pericarp tissues dissected from the caryopsis at stage c . for osmla10-like in these tissues, the corresponding mirnas  are mostly detected in the embryo and pericarp whereas osmla10-like expression is higher in the endosperm. the degradation products detected during earlier stages suggest that osmla10-like transcription was initially higher and that the function of the mirna was to inhibit its expression in the embryo and pericarp. in contrast, the pot-mirnas targeting the ga3oxidase <dig> gene predominantly accumulate in the endosperm where the target is also actively transcribed. according to the degradome data, the ga3ox <dig> probably starts to be expressed during stage b when the first cleavage products can be detected. the role of the mirna may be to modulate level of ga3ox <dig> transcripts and consequently prevent excess ga accumulation in the endosperm. these two examples highlight the complexity of multilayer gene regulations and the requirement for complementary studies in order to analyse how, where and when a gene is regulated.

CONCLUSIONS
the data we have generated provides a comprehensive source of information about the timing of mirna regulation during grain development. regulation by mirnas peaks during the transition phase  which correlates with the timing of a major change in transcript profiles. the  <dig> potential mirna target genes we identified are predicted to be involved in various functions including photosynthesis, carbohydrate translocation, phytohormone signalling, cell differentiation and defence response. our data suggest an upstream function of the mirnas in coordinating tissue specification and energy mobilization to ensure proper growth and development of the grain.

as increasing amounts of genome sequence data become available our data can be re-examined to identify more mirna precursors and refine the predictions of which genes are under mirna regulation. the analysis of the biological roles of mirnas in cereals currently depends on transgenic approaches; however the identification of mirna resistant target mrnas that give rise to altered phenotypes in rice and barley  <cit>  suggests that the use of high-throughput methods to identify sequence changes leading to mirna-resistant targets will allow assessment of the roles of other mirnas.
