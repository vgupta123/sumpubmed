BACKGROUND
the vertebrate gut is a remarkable structure that ingests and digests food, absorbs nutrients, and removes waste products. the gut originates from a simple tubular structure composed of three germ layers including an underlying endoderm, a surrounding splanchnic mesoderm, and an ectoderm
 <cit> . in mouse embryos, the gut becomes patterned along the anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral, left-right, and radial axes. the gut tube consists of the foregut, midgut, and hindgut along its anterior-posterior axis
 <cit> . as development progresses, the foregut gives rise to the esophagus, stomach, liver, lungs, and pancreas. the midgut forms the small intestine and the hindgut develops into the large intestine
 <cit> .

the stomach is derived from the posterior foregut. the stomach morphologically differentiates from the foregut tube around embryonic day  <dig>   and the expansion of the pre-gastric mesenchyme allows the domain of the stomach to be visible beginning at e <dig> 
 <cit> . mesenchymal cells of stomach differentiate into four distinct concentric layers, including lamina propria, muscularis mucosae, and circular and longitudinal smooth muscle at different stages of embryonic development
 <cit> . by e <dig> , the stomach is distinctly enlarged. the stomach smooth muscle differentiates at e <dig>  with a distinct layer of α-smooth muscle actin -positive cells appearing and a circular muscle layer forming throughout the stomach
 <cit> . the smooth muscle layer thickens in the constricted prospective pyloric sphincter region at about e <dig> 
 <cit> . at e <dig> , the pyloric sphincter begins to function in preventing the reflux of duodenal contents into the stomach
 <cit> .

the posterior or pylorus portion of the stomach is the anatomical junction between the stomach and the duodenum. at the terminus of the pylorus, the distinct valvular flaps of the pyloric sphincter can be seen
 <cit> . under normal physiological conditions, the stomach depends on its peristaltic contraction to grind and thrust the partially digested food, and the pylorus relies on its thickened pyloric sphincter to control the flow of food into the small intestine. abnormalities in pyloric development or in the contractile function of the pylorus cause reflux of duodenal contents into the stomach and increase the risk of gastric metaplasia and cancer
 <cit> . abnormalities of the pylorus are related to congenital defects
 <cit> . therefore, much attention has been given to the regulating elements and pathways of stomach development, especially pylorus and pyloric sphincter development.

previous data in chick suggested that bone morphogenetic protein  signaling regulates mesenchymal expression of nkx <dig>  and sox <dig>  which affects the character of the pyloric epithelium but has no effect on pyloric smooth muscle
 <cit> , suggesting that mesenchymal signaling by unknown factors affects the pyloric epithelial phenotype. in the mouse, molecular mechanisms of pyloric formation are little understood, with relatively few of the factors required for normal pyloric development having been identified. those that have been include sox <dig> <cit> , six <dig> <cit> , bapx <dig> <cit> , nkx <dig>  <cit> , gremlin <cit> , and gata <dig> <cit> . ablation of the homeodomain transcription factor, six <dig>  expressed in posterior stomach, disrupts thickening of the pyloric smooth muscle layer and attenuates constriction of the pylorus sphincter. in addition, loss of six <dig> eliminates sox <dig> expression, and reduces nkx <dig>  and gremlin expression in the pylorus, although this expression later recovers
 <cit> , suggesting that six <dig>  sox <dig>  nkx <dig> , and gremlin are required for pyloric development. in addition, nkx <dig> , sox <dig>  and gata <dig> are co-expressed in the dorsal pyloric outer longitudinal muscle  layer that matures between e <dig>  and e <dig> . following deletion of nkx <dig>  or gata <dig>  the dorsal pyloric olm is almost absent and constriction of the pylorus sphincter is attenuated
 <cit> .

the lim homeodomain  transcription factor isl <dig> was originally found to function as an insulin gene enhancer binding protein
 <cit> . isl <dig> is comprised of two tandem lim domains and a homeodomain. the homeodomain, with its helix-turn-helix structure, binds to regulatory dna sequences of target genes, while the lim domains are mainly involved in protein-protein interactions that regulate the activity of the lim-hd
 <cit> . isl <dig> plays critical roles in cell determination, proliferation, and differentiation in the nervous system
 <cit> , heart
 <cit> , and pituitary gland
 <cit> . in addition, isl <dig> expression has been detected in gastric mesenchyme
 <cit>  and gastrointestinal epithelium in both embryonic and adult mice
 <cit> . however, the role of isl <dig> in stomach development has yet to be explored. in the present study, we examined isl <dig> expression in the stomach. isl <dig> was highly expressed in the posterior stomach in early stages of development and was mainly restricted to the smooth muscle cells of the pylorus. to examine isl <dig> function in stomach development, we utilized a tamoxifen-inducible knockout mouse model. an inducible model was needed because isl1-/- mutants die at approximately e <dig>  owing to defects in heart formation. our results show that isl <dig> is vital for formation of the pyloric olm layer during stomach organogenesis.

RESULTS
isl <dig> is expressed in embryonic mouse stomach
we examined isl <dig> mrna levels in embryonic mouse stomach by real-time quantitative pcr  and whole mount in situ hybridization . isl <dig> mrna was initially detected at e <dig>  by rt-qpcr. isl <dig> reached the highest level at e <dig> , followed by a sharp decline at e <dig> , and had no significant changes into adulthood . this result was similar to a previous report
 <cit> . the localization of isl <dig> mrna expression was investigated using wish. we performed isl <dig> wish in embryonic stomach at e <dig> , e <dig> , and e <dig> . at e <dig> , isl <dig> was localized to the posterior half of the stomach . however, the isl <dig> wish signal was much stronger and condensed in the pylorus by e <dig>  . as stomach development progressed, the pylorus continued to express isl <dig> and expression of isl <dig> extended to the prospective pyloric sphincter at e <dig>  . however, the isl <dig> wish signal weakened considerably from e <dig>  to e <dig> . these isl <dig> wish results concurred with isl <dig> rt-qpcr results.

we then assessed isl <dig> protein expression by immunohistochemistry. results demonstrated that isl <dig> was mainly localized to the posterior stomach mesenchyme from e <dig>  to e <dig> , then isl <dig> was expressed in smooth muscle cells of the pylorus , and was also detectable in the lamina propria . in adult mouse stomach, only a few isl1-positive cells were observed in the smooth muscle layer .

isl1-positive cells are co-expressed with α-smooth muscle actin in embryonic mouse stomach
to see whether isl <dig> expression was related to smooth muscle development of the pylorus, we examined the expression of isl <dig> and the earliest smooth muscle marker α-sma using immunofluorescence. results demonstrated that the proportion of isl1-positive cells expressing α-sma gradually increased . at e <dig> , no α-sma-positive cells were detected, although isl <dig> was highly expressed in the mesenchyme of the posterior stomach. at e <dig> , a subset of isl1-positive cells, mainly those in the inner circular muscle  of the pylorus, were α-sma positive. by e <dig> , pyloric olm has already undergone differentiation
 <cit> . at e <dig> , the majority of isl1-positive cells in the pylorus were α-sma positive. isl <dig> expression persisted in mature pyloric icm and olm, and lamina propria cells also expressed isl <dig> . in addition, isl <dig> expression was examined in human samples of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis by immunofluorescence, and results demonstrated that isl <dig> was also expressed in human smooth muscle cells of the pylorus . therefore, these results suggest that isl <dig> may participate in the formation of pyloric sphincter.

isl <dig> expression is effectively ablated in isl1mcm/f-inducible knockout mice
to investigate effects of isl <dig> ablation on stomach development, we utilized isl1mcm/f-inducible cre  mice  and isl1f/+mice were used as controls
 <cit> . embryos were genotyped by pcr at e <dig>   and intact or mutant isl <dig> mrna was distinguished by semi-quantitative pcr .

western blot analyses showed that isl <dig> protein levels in embryonic stomach of isl1mcm/del mice were significantly lower than those in isl1f/+mice . immunofluorescence results demonstrated significantly reduced isl <dig> staining in pylorus of isl1mcm/del mice as compared to controls . these data demonstrate that isl <dig> expression was effectively down-regulated in isl1mcm/del mutant stomachs.

pyloric abnormalities in isl1mcm/f mutants
to investigate effects of isl <dig> ablation on stomach development, we compared morphological and histological differences between isl1mcm/del and isl1f/+stomachs at e <dig> . at e <dig> , yellow fluid was observed in isl1mcm/del stomachs but not in stomachs of isl1f/+littermates . histological examination demonstrated that the dorsal pyloric smooth muscle layer was much thinner in the pylorus of isl1mcm/del mice compared with controls . we examined expression and distribution of α-sma in both isl1mcm/del mutants and isl1f/+pylorus. immunofluorescence results demonstrated that isl <dig> deficiency led to nearly complete absence of the pyloric olm layer at e <dig> , and remaining cells were loosely organized . in addition, constriction of the pyloric sphincter was attenuated in isl1mcm/del mutant stomachs when compared with constriction in isl1f/+stomachs . furthermore, we analyzed expression of the smooth muscle specific protein calponin- <dig> at e <dig> , and immunofluorescence results demonstrated that loss of isl <dig> also resulted in near absence of calponin- <dig> expression in the dorsal pyloric olm layer, similar to result with α-sma . sox <dig> is expressed in both epithelium and mesenchyme
 <cit>  and is required for development of olm and formation of pyloric sphincter constriction
 <cit> . our immunofluorescence results showed that sox <dig> remained at normal levels in stomach epithelium of isl1mcm/del mice at e <dig>  and e <dig>  , but the area of pyloric smooth muscle expressing sox <dig> was significantly reduced in isl1mcm/del mutants at e <dig>   and absent at e <dig>  . thus, isl <dig> was required for sox <dig> expression in dorsal pyloric olm cells. these results indicate that isl <dig> is critical for regulating development of mouse pyloric smooth muscle.

expression and distribution of protein gene product  <dig>  , an enteric nervous system marker
 <cit> , was intact at e <dig>  in isl1mcm/del mutant stomachs . pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene  <dig>  is expressed in epithelial cells of the antral-pyloric segment and the rostral duodenum
 <cit> . our immunofluorescence results showed that pdx <dig> expression was similar in isl1mcm/del mice when compared with controls at e <dig>  . in addition, the mouse stomach and duodenal epithelial boundary was established between e <dig>  and e <dig> 
 <cit> , this period coinciding with development of the olm layer
 <cit> . we tested the integrity of the stomach-small intestine epithelial pyloric border at e <dig>  by examining expression of an intestine-specific epithelial marker cdx2
 <cit> . our immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that the position of the epithelial pyloric border in isl1mcm/del mice was similar to that of controls . these results indicate that loss of isl <dig> does not affect innervation or epithelial development of the pylorus.

loss of isl <dig> does not affect proliferation or apoptosis of pyloric inner circular muscle and outer longitudinal muscle cells
to see whether isl <dig> expression was related to cell proliferation of the pylorus, we examined co-localization of isl <dig> and the proliferative marker bromodeoxyuridine  using immunofluorescence in isl1f/+mice. our results showed that brdu-positive cells were dense at e <dig>  and scattered throughout the icm and olm regions at e <dig>  and e <dig>  . in addition, the proportion of proliferating icm and olm cells was not significantly different between isl1mcm/del and isl1f/+mice at e <dig>  .

to assess a potential impact on apoptosis, we examined cleaved caspase  <dig> expression at e <dig> , and our immunofluorescence results showed there were no caspase 3-positive cells in pyloric icm or the olm layer of isl1mcm/del and isl1f/+mice . these data indicate that isl <dig> ablation does not affect proliferation or apoptosis of pyloric icm and olm cells.

loss of isl <dig> results in decreased expression of gata <dig>  gremlin, and nkx <dig> 
since a numbers of factors, including bapx <dig> <cit> , barx <dig> <cit> , gata <dig> <cit> , gremlin <cit> , nkx <dig>  <cit> , and six <dig> <cit> , have been reported to be involved in regulation of pyloric development, we examined the effects of loss of isl <dig> on expression of these genes at e <dig>  and e <dig> . rt-qpcr results showed that loss of isl <dig> did not affect expression of bapx <dig> or barx <dig> at either e <dig>  or e <dig>  . at e <dig> , α-sma and six <dig> mrna levels were significantly lower in isl1mcm/del mice as compared with controls . at both e <dig>  and e <dig> , nkx <dig> , gata <dig>  and gremlin mrna levels in the stomach of isl1mcm/del mice were lower than controls . gata <dig> mrna levels were approximately 70% decreased at both stages examined . based on these results, we investigated isl <dig>  gata <dig>  gremlin, and nkx <dig>  expression in isl1mcm/f mutant and isl1f/+stomachs using wish. results demonstrated that expression of each of these genes was mainly confined to the pyloric region, as expected; gata <dig> expression was more reduced in mutant stomachs; and gremlin and nkx <dig>  only had subtle changes . isl <dig> and gata <dig> expression were the most strongly affected . these results were consistent with rt-qpcr data and suggest that isl <dig> regulates expression of gata <dig>  gremlin, and nkx <dig> .

isl <dig> targets gata <dig> and activates its transcription
gata <dig> is selectively expressed in the pylorus of the developing mouse embryo
 <cit> . expression of both isl <dig> and gata <dig> mrna was observed in the pylorus at e <dig> , but whether gata <dig> and isl <dig> are expressed in the same cells has not been explored. therefore, we examined expression of isl <dig> and gata <dig> by immunofluorescence analyses. results demonstrated that isl <dig> and gata <dig> proteins were co-expressed within the same cells of the pylorus at e <dig>  and e <dig>  in isl1f/+control stomachs . in addition, the area expressing gata <dig> was significantly smaller in isl1mcm/del mutant pyloric smooth muscle layer at e <dig>   and it was lost at e <dig>  in the pyloric olm layer . thus, isl <dig> was required for gata <dig> expression in the dorsal pyloric olm layer. to investigate whether isl <dig> regulates pyloric development by directly regulating gata <dig>  we performed bioinformatics analysis of the gata <dig> genomic locus. the mouse gata <dig> gene contains several putative isl <dig> response elements  at - <dig>  base pairs  to + <dig>  bp from the transcription initiation sites
 <cit> . we identified  <dig> areas that contained a putative isl <dig> binding site , and  <dig> pairs of corresponding primers were designed to amplify these regions following chromatin immunoprecipitation  studies utilizing antibody to isl <dig>  immunoprecipitated genomic dna was obtained from pyloric regions of mouse embryos at e <dig> . of the  <dig> putative isl <dig> binding areas, two discrete regions, in the - <dig>  bp to - <dig>  bp  and - <dig>  bp to - <dig> bp , were occupied by isl <dig> protein. this result was confirmed by semi-quantitative pcr  and the fold enrichment method .

luciferase assays were also performed to investigate the ability of isl <dig> to regulate the gata3-p <dig> or gata3-p <dig> enhancer regions. results of these luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that isl <dig> overexpression enhanced activity of the gata3-p1-wild-type luciferase reporter approximately  <dig> -fold . site-directed mutagenesis revealed that mutation of the isl <dig> consensus site within the p <dig> enhancer selectively decreased the ability of isl <dig> co-transfection to activate the reporter. isl <dig> expression did not affect luciferase activities of gata3-p6-wild-type, gata3-p6-mutant-type and pgl <dig> -basic . together, the data strongly suggest that isl <dig> regulates gata <dig> transcription by binding to the gata3-p <dig> element at the - <dig>  bp to - <dig>  bp region.

to further investigate this, electrophoretic mobility shift assays  were performed with in vitro translated pcdna <dig> -isl <dig> and control vector respectively. the gata3-p <dig> enhancer region included three putative atta binding sites, and isl <dig> efficiently bound to oligonucleotides representing number  <dig> and  <dig> sites . binding of isl <dig> to number  <dig> and  <dig> sites was specifically competed for by excess unlabeled probes but not by excess unlabeled probes containing mutations within the isl <dig> consensus binding sites . additionally, binding to isl <dig> consensus site containing oligonucleotides was blocked by isl <dig> antibody. collectively, these data demonstrate that isl <dig> is a direct regulator of gata <dig> transcription.

discussion
the presented results show that isl <dig> is highly expressed in early stages of stomach development in mouse embryos, being confined at later stages to the muscle layer of the pylorus. previous results demonstrated that isl <dig> expression in the developing stomach is restricted to the ventral gastric mesenchyme at e <dig> 
 <cit> , and sharply increases until e <dig> . during this period of time, the mouse stomach undergoes expansion from the foregut tube
 <cit> , and the circular muscle layer of the stomach forms
 <cit> . our results further demonstrate that isl <dig> expression is localized to the posterior stomach mesenchyme from e <dig>  to e <dig> , and is concentrated in the smooth muscle cells of the pylorus at later stages of stomach development, although isl1-positive cells are also detectable in the lamina propria. these results suggest that isl <dig> might be involved in the regulation of stomach organogenesis and in development of the pyloric smooth muscle layer, which is derived from stomach mesenchyme. in support of this, ablation of isl <dig> led to nearly complete absence of the pyloric olm layer at e <dig> .

stomach organogenesis occurs after e <dig>  during mouse development
 <cit> . isl <dig> null mouse embryos show developmental anomalies at e <dig>  and die at e10
 <cit> . to prolong the life of the embryos, we adopted a delayed knockout strategy using a tamoxifen-inducible mutated estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain -cre-mer recombinase targeted to the isl <dig> locus, administering tamoxifen at e <dig> . our results are in agreement with a previous report that showed that the isl1mcm/del mice died in the perinatal period
 <cit> . we thus examined effects of isl <dig> ablation beginning at e <dig>  on mouse stomach development during the subsequent embryonic development period. we found that isl <dig> expression was effectively down-regulated at both gene and protein levels. further morphological and histological results demonstrated that the dorsal pyloric smooth muscle layer was much thinner in the pylorus of isl1mcm/del mice when compared with that of isl1f/+mice. further evidence that isl <dig> is required for formation and growth of the pylorus was that duodenogastric reflux, which results from reduced contractile activity of the pyloric sphincter
 <cit> , was clearly observed in isl1mcm/del stomachs.

to investigate the cellular mechanisms by which loss of isl <dig> resulted in underdevelopment of the pylorus, we tested effects of isl <dig> ablation on pyloric cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. loss of isl <dig> had no significant effects on pyloric cell proliferation or apoptosis. these results are consistent with previous results suggesting that isl <dig> is not likely to be involved in promoting proliferation of gastrointestinal epithelium
 <cit> . α-sma is essential for muscle differentiation, and widely used as a smooth muscle marker
 <cit> . the proportion of cells expressing α-sma among isl1-positive cells significantly increased from e <dig>  to e <dig> . isl <dig> ablation resulted in loss of the dorsal pyloric olm layer and decreased α-sma expression in isl1mcm/del stomachs when compared to isl1f/+at e <dig> . therefore, we suggest that isl <dig> affects pyloric development mainly by regulating dorsal pyloric olm layer formation.

to reveal the molecular mechanisms by which isl <dig> regulates pyloric development, we assessed the relationship between isl <dig> and genes that are required for pyloric development, including bapx <dig>  barx <dig>  nkx <dig> , gremlin, six <dig>  and gata <dig>  isl1mcm/del mutants exhibited somewhat decreased expressions of nkx <dig>  and gremlin. subtle changes in nkx <dig>  and gremlin expression may be owing to the loss of some muscle, where these genes were expressed. however, expression of gata <dig> was most dramatically down-regulated. furthermore, gata <dig> deletion also abrogated development of the olm layer, leading to loss of sox <dig> expression and pyloric constriction
 <cit> . these results in gata <dig> null mice demonstrate that gata <dig> is required for the survival of these smooth muscle cells, and stomachs are phenotypically similar to those observed in isl1mcm/del mutants.

to investigate whether gata <dig> is a direct downstream target of isl <dig> in stomach, we performed chip assays utilizing isl <dig> antibody and chromatin from embryonic stomach, and emsa assays with in vitro translated isl <dig> protein. we found direct binding of isl <dig> to several consensus isl <dig> response elements in regions surrounding the gata <dig> transcription start site. in addition, co-transfection studies demonstrated the ability of an isl <dig> expression vector to activate expression of the defined gata <dig> enhancer element. collectively, our data demonstrate that isl <dig> directly interacts with enhancer elements in the gata <dig> promoter region in stomach to activate gata <dig> expression at the transcriptional level.

based on results presented here and previously published for mouse pyloric development, we propose a model for a molecular interaction network controlling pyloric development . bapx <dig> expression is lost in barx1-null stomachs, and loss of bapx <dig> does not affect nkx <dig>  expression, but gene expression microarrays show decreased sox9
 <cit> . thus, barx <dig> may regulate sox <dig> through bapx <dig>  loss of six <dig> reduces nkx <dig> , gremlin, and sox <dig> expression in pylorus
 <cit> , and nkx <dig>  null stomachs also lead to loss of sox <dig> expression
 <cit> ; so, it is possible that sox <dig> is regulated by six <dig> through nkx <dig> . in addition, sox <dig> is absent after deletion of gata <dig>  and there is no direct relationship between gata <dig> and nkx <dig>  <cit> , and our results demonstrate that isl <dig> directly regulates gata <dig>  which suggests that sox <dig> is regulated by isl <dig> via gata <dig>  thus, all of these pathways converge on sox <dig> and confirm the critical role of sox <dig> in pyloric development.

our study demonstrated that isl <dig> is highly expressed in the developing mouse stomach and in particular in the pylorus. functionally, isl <dig> is required for pyloric olm layer development. we have further shown that isl <dig> directly targets gata <dig>  reduced expression of gata <dig> can account for the pyloric phenotype observed in isl <dig> mutants. in light of the results presented here, isl <dig> is critical for stomach organogenesis and pyloric olm development. these findings are important for our understanding of diseases resulting from abnormalities of pyloric sphincter development.

CONCLUSIONS
this work sheds new light on isl <dig> expression and gives mechanistic insight into isl <dig> function in developing pylorus of mouse embryos. we found that isl <dig> was strongly expressed in the posterior stomach of mouse embryos and mainly confined to the muscle layer of the pylorus. in addition, the proportion of isl1-positive cells expressing α-sma gradually increased in the pylorus as development progressed and loss of isl <dig> resulted in loss of the dorsal pyloric olm layer in isl1mcm/del stomachs at e <dig> . these new findings demonstrate that isl <dig> is involved in regulating pyloric olm development. subsequent analysis further revealed that isl <dig> ensures normal stomach pyloric development via directly targeting gata <dig>  these findings are highly clinically relevant and will help us to better understand the cause of related diseases such as hypertrophic pyloric stenosis resulting from smooth muscle hypertrophy in the pylorus.
