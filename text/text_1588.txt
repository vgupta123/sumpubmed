BACKGROUND
cancer progression is characterized, in part, by altered or aberrant transcription factor  function, leading to changes in expression of cancer related genes  <cit> . mesenchymal to epithelial transition  and its mirror process  are critical to metastasis in cancer progression  <cit> . we recently demonstrated  <cit>  a novel function of the ovol <dig>  and ovol <dig>  tfs as critical inducers of met in prostate cancer.  one of the outcomes of this recent work suggests the hypothesis that the ovols have roles in regulating met in multiple cancers. this hypothesis is also consistent with our earlier work  <cit> , where we found common underlying genetic etiology for related disease phenotypes. we also found in earlier work  <cit>  that exploring this common underlying genetic etiology using a systems biology approach can lead to improved understanding of the related phenotypes and interactions among the genetic influences on them, and may point out potential clinically significant biomarkers or drug targets.

in the present work , we explore the hypothesis that the ovol tfs induce met  in multiple cancers, focusing on commonalities between prostate cancer  and breast cancer  models. we generate a common oi-met gene expression signature, consistent with a common underlying genetic etiology for met in pc and bc, and show that the oi-met gene set is significantly enriched for cancer, bc, pc, and met-associated genes. using a systems biology approach, we identify regulation of gene expression as the primary influence of the ovols on met in these two models, though this effect is indirect and depends on interaction with ap <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig>  and nfkb <dig> tfs. we create an oi-met-tf sub-model of the genes annotated as being regulated by the ovols and these other four tfs. we test this model for consistency with known genetic influences on met, bc, pc and cancer, and find that there is significant evidence supporting the use of this network as a model of gene expression influences on met, as well as bc and pc, and more generally in cancer. we reflect the inference from the oi-met-tf model back to the larger set of all oi-met genes and show that the effects of the ovols and the other tfs in the oi-met-tf model are likely to be consistent in the larger set, with experimental data significantly in support of this hypothesis. in particular, we find significant evidence that the ap1/myc tf pair has an important role in regulating gene expression in met related to bc, pc, and to cancer in general.

RESULTS
oi-met gene expression signature
we established met gene expression signatures to characterize changes of gene expression in models of pc and bc . previously we demonstrated a role for the ovol-tfs in the induction of met  <cit> . furthermore, based on oncomine  <cit>  data, we found that the gene expression analysis of the ovol-tfs significantly correlates with the expression of met markers in multiple cancer types. we approached the discovery of the met signature by over-expression of ovol <dig>  ovol <dig>  or both ovols in the mesenchymal prostate cancer  and breast cancer  cell lines. in the prostate cancer model, we analyzed the following cell lines: pc3-emt14-ovol <dig> , pc3-emt14-ovol <dig>  and pc3-epi   <cit> . each of these ovol-expressing cell lines demonstrated a stable transition to the met phenotype. we also confirmed the met phenotype in these models by showing differential expression of critical met markers including: up-regulation of e-cad expression plus down-regulation of both vimentin and the emt-inducing tf zeb <dig>  <cit> . we performed a parallel analysis for bc using breast cancer mda-mb- <dig> cells, a poorly differentiated mesenchymal-type  <cit> . in this model we analyzed the following cell lines: mda-mb-231-ovol <dig> , mda-mb-231-ovol <dig>  and mda-mb-231- ovol1/ <dig>   <cit> . as in the pc experiment, the bc ovol-expressing cell lines demonstrated a stable transition to the met phenotype and appropriate expression of met and emt related genes.

given these two models of related cancer phenotypes, and testing our hypothesis that they should share underlying genetic influences, we searched for a common oi-met gene expression signature for these two models. we assessed differential gene expression in each of the models of oi-met by rna-seq, and established a set of genes representing the oi-met expression signature for each model. in each model , we selected the union of sets of genes responsive to ovol <dig>  ovol <dig>  or both, using fdr ≤  <dig>  and fold change ≥ ±  <dig>  and “test ok” thresholds . this selection yielded  <dig>  genes in bc and  <dig>  genes in pc. focusing on common underlying genetic etiology for these related phenotypes, the  <dig> genes at the intersection of these two sets  represent a common oi-met gene expression signature for these two cancer models. of these  <dig> genes, 66% follow the same pattern  in the comparison of ovol1& <dig> treated cells across the bc and pc models. we included all  <dig> genes in this analysis, ignoring direction, to include all genes that show strong responses in both models and to minimize the assumptions required in gene selection. for responsive genes, the direction of expression change is frequently a result of transient factors  <cit> , even to the extent that the individual mrnas that compose a single gene can be oppositely regulated  <cit> . we opted to pursue those details on a gene-by-gene basis in future work.

enrichment of bc, pc, cancer, and met annotation among the oi-met signature genes
we hypothesized that the oi-met signature gene set represents a model of differential gene expression in met, common to bc and pc. therefore, we expected a significant proportion of these genes to have been previously associated with met, bc, pc, and/or cancer in the literature. to test this hypothesis, we searched both pubmed and pubmed central  using an ncbi e-utilities perl script to search for each of the  <dig> genes  and the phenotype of interest. for example, the query for one of these searches was  + and + . text word searches for these keywords cast a relatively wide net, capturing essentially any co-occurrence of the gene symbol and the keyword of interest in the manuscript. for instance, a manuscript could mention a given gene and cancer but only in a tangential way, not really associating the gene with cancer. these searches are not very specific because the definition of “text words” is broad, but they provide an upper bound on the number of publications associating each gene with the keyword. we tested the significance of over-representation of each of these annotations in our gene set using a re-sampling approach similar to li, et al.  <cit> , by randomly selecting  <dig> sets of  <dig> genes from the hgnc set, repeating the query for each of these sets, then comparing the number of “hits” in the observed set of  <dig> genes versus the random sets. we ranked the proportion of genes with hits in the observed set with the proportions of genes in the  <dig> random sets to produce an empirical p-value.

we are also interested in testing the selected  <dig> gene set for association with met, but the text for “mesenchymal to epithelial transition” and “epithelial to mesenchymal transition” are complex, so they are relatively little used in the literature. to overcome this limitation and to balance the high false positive rate expected with the text word searches, we used mesh  <cit>   searches to look for associations between each gene and met/emt in the literature. a mesh term search is more conservative than a text word search, because the mesh annotation for each manuscript is specific and curated. as such, true gene/keyword associations may be missed, but this provides a lower bound on the number of publications associating each gene with met. the query for one of these searches was  + and + . to test the significance of these results we used a contingency table  to calculate a χ <dig> value and corresponding p-value.

pubmed is a valuable resource for finding text on genes related to cancer in the biomedical literature but not all of pubmed is searchable. pmc is another valuable source of text relating genes to cancer, but it is a less complete collection of manuscripts than pubmed - only ones that are entirely open source. therefore, we used both the pubmed and pmc databases for our search. in both cases, we compare the proportion of genes associated with each of the keywords in the  <dig> gene oi-met signature set, versus the proportion genes associated with each of the keywords for all  <dig>  hgnc gene symbols. notably, many genes have aliases that do not match the hgnc symbol. in that sense, our literature search is conservative because it misses associations between gene and keyword where the gene is not identified by hgnc symbol. another important consideration is that the literature includes genes that are extensively studied, others that are not as well studied, and some that are essentially unstudied. the genes that are unstudied do not show up in manuscripts, though they may be included in both sets of genes that we studied.

in table  <dig>  assessing the upper bounds on gene associations with bc, pc, and cancer in the pubmed  search, we see that ~ <dig> % to  <dig> % of genes in the oi-met signature set are associated with the tested keywords. the equivalent percentages are ~ <dig> % to  <dig> % of genes in the pmc search. for all six tests the empirical p-value is <  <dig> . these results are consistent with the oi-met signature set having a high concentration of bc, pc, and cancer associated genes. it also is consistent with the oi-met set being a useful model for differential gene expression in bc, pc, and cancer. assessing the lower bounds on association of the oi-met gene set with met/emt, we find that the mesh queries in pubmed and pmc show, respectively, ~ <dig> % and  <dig> % of the oi-met genes as being associated with met in the literature. comparing this to the same queries for all genes, we find a significant enrichment for met associated genes in the oi-met signature set. for the pubmed comparison, the enrichment is more than  <dig>  fold , with a p-value <  <dig> . for the pmc comparison, the enrichment is more than  <dig>  fold , also with a p-value <  <dig> . both of these results are statistically significant, and the fold changes are likely to be biologically relevant, consistent with the oi-met signature gene set being a useful model for differential gene expression in met.

“cancer”, “breast cancer”, and “prostate cancer” text word searches show that a high proportion of oi-met genes are associated with these concepts in the literature. “epithelial-mesenchymal transition” mesh term searches show a significant enrichment of this annotation in the oi-met set, relative to all genes:  <dig> % ÷  <dig> % =  <dig>  fold enrichment for pubmed;  <dig> % ÷  <dig> % =  <dig>  fold enrichment for pmc; both with p-value <  <dig> .

ovol tf targets in oi-met
the set of  <dig> genes in the oi-met set were all significantly differentially expressed in response to ovol expression. as such, we tested whether they could all be direct targets of the ovol tfs. using the genomatix genome analyzer’s  gene2promoter  <cit>  function, we found  <dig>  promoter sequences associated with the mrnas coded by the  <dig> genes in the common oi-met signature. we searched these promoter sequences for ovol binding motifs using gga’s matinspector  <cit>  function, with default parameter settings, and found that only  <dig>  of the  <dig>  promoters had one or more ovol binding motifs. this result suggests that, while the ovols induced differential expression of all of these genes, the effect must be indirect for at least two thirds of the oi-met genes.

enrichment testing by conceptgen
since the ovols’ effects on gene expression in met are not direct, we sought to understand the direct systems involved in oi-met using conceptgen  <cit>  enrichment testing. this search is complementary to the literature search, based on annotation derived from the literature. of the  <dig> genes in the oi-met signature,  <dig> uniquely mapped to entrez geneids using the david  <cit>  id converter. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> had annotation in at least one category in conceptgen. in the most significant block of annotation , we found enrichment for annotation consistent with met , and with cancer metastasis . as we found in the literature search, these results are consistent with the oi-met signature being a useful model for characterizing differential gene expression in met associated with bc and pc progression.

also consistent with the observation that the ovol tfs likely regulate gene expression in oi-met, conceptgen found enrichment for “signal transduction” fdr  <dig> e- <dig> and “gene expression regulation, neoplastic” fdr  <dig> e- <dig>  this led us to pursue the details of gene expression regulation in this annotation, and we found enrichment for regulation of gene expression by five tfs: ap- <dig>  fdr  <dig> e- <dig>  c-jun  fdr  <dig> e- <dig>  nf-kappa b  fdr  <dig> e- <dig>  stat <dig> fdr  <dig> e- <dig>  and stat <dig> fdr  <dig> e- <dig> . the genes in the ap <dig> and jun sets are annotated as transfac  <cit>   targets while the genes in the nfkb <dig>  stat <dig>  and stat <dig> sets are annotated as being associated with the tfs in mesh  <cit>  annotation. notably, though conceptgen identified one set of genes as being transfac targets for ap <dig> and an overlapping set for jun, ap- <dig> is a dimer  <cit>  of subunits from the fos and jun gene families , so we collapsed the ap- <dig> and c-jun sets into a single set of genes targeted by the ap <dig> dimer. note that nf-kappa b is also a dimer composed of subunit pairs  <cit>  . tfs routinely work together as homo- or hetero-dimers, or in modules composed of multiple tf complexes  <cit> . this observation, along with our previous observation that the ovols influence the oi-met gene set indirectly, led us to hypothesize that the ovol tfs impact met through interaction with, or in collaboration with, these other four tfs.

ovols use complex mechanisms to regulate ap <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig>  and nfkb
we used the expression data derived from this experiment to test this hypothesis . we assessed the effects of the ovols on expression of ap <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig>  and nfkb. for some genes, “expression level” is assayed at only the gene level. other genes are derived from multiple mrnas, so they are assayed at the isoform level then the data are aggregated to produce gene level expression information. we looked for up-regulation  or down-regulation . we looked for isoform switching, meaning that one isoform is up-regulated and another isoform is down-regulated , as a potential regulatory mechanism in genes where more than one mrna was tested. within the ap <dig>  group, the fos genes are regulated in both bc and pc, at both the gene and isoform levels . the individual members of the jun family are regulated at the gene level, similar to the way isoform switching is used in the fos group. within the stat group , isoform level regulation is employed in bc while both isoform switching and gene level regulation are employed in pc. within the nfkb group, gene level regulation is employed.

we assessed the effects of the ovols on expression of ap <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig>  and nfkb based on our rna-seq data for both bc and pc. we looked for up-regulation , down-regulation , or isoform switching . within the ap <dig>  group, the fos genes are regulated in both bc and pc, at both the gene and isoform levels . the individual members of the jun family are regulated at the gene level, similar to the way isoform switching is used in the fos group. within the stat group , isoform level regulation is employed in bc while both isoform switching and gene level regulation are employed in pc. within the nfkb group, gene level regulation is employed.

development of the oi-met-tf network
to help us understand the potential roles of these tfs in oi-met, we used genego metacore  <cit>  to model the networks of interactions among each of the gene sets annotated as targets for the four tfs , and the ovol tfs. in each of these subsets, we included the genes annotated as tf targets in the conceptgen analysis, as well as the tf, and used parameter settings to produce the most parsimonious models possible .

the ap <dig>  stat <dig>  and stat <dig> networks each include all of the input genes in a very simple, parsimonious, network . this is consistent with what was expected for the ap <dig> network because the genes in this set are annotated as being direct ap <dig> binding targets in transfac annotation. note that additional file  <dig> is the key for interpreting genego graphics and that the icon labeled “ap <dig> ” represents the dimer of fos and jun gene family members in a single icon. genes in the stat <dig> and stat <dig> networks are found in mesh annotation and, while all the genes are in the network, they are not all direct targets of the tf. the nfkb <dig> network , also derived from mesh annotation, illustrates that the annotation does not necessarily indicate direct interaction with the tf. rather, using the same parameter settings as for the other networks, ngfr, card <dig>  and nalp <dig> are disconnected genes. also, this network includes nfkbia, which interacts closely with, but is distinct from the nfkb <dig> dimer. note that genego used two icons for nfkb <dig>  but we collapsed them into a single rectangular icon in this graphic. it’s possible that a more complex  nfkb <dig> network would connect all the genes in the nfkb <dig> set, but our hypothesis is that these four tfs work together in regulating the genes differentially expressed in oi-met. therefore, we developed the network for the combined set of genes targeted by the four tfs using the parameter settings for the parsimonious network. the network we found  is consistent with this hypothesis; it connects all the genes and includes only one gene that was not part of the input set .

while this network is highly consistent with the cooperative regulation of these genes by this set of four tfs in oi-met, it does not yet explain the effects of the ovol tfs. to understand how the ovols impact this network, we created a network similar to those of the four tfs enriched in the conceptgen analysis. consistent with the other networks, we focused on the targets of ovol <dig> and ovol <dig> . in the ovol sub-network, ovol <dig> shows eight annotated targets while ovol <dig> shows only three annotated targets, with myc as the single target common to the two ovols. as we did in developing the network in the previous step, we added the ovol targets sub-network to the ap <dig>  nfkb <dig>  stat <dig>  and stat <dig> network and found that the ovols have multiple indirect influences on this combined network . we call this the oi-met-tf network because it focuses on only the genes annotated as being targets of the four tfs enriched in conceptgen data, plus the ovols and their targets.

we hypothesized that the ovols work indirectly in influencing the expression of the oi-met genes. based on this hypothesis, we would expect the oi-met-tf gene set to form a connected and parsimonious network. consistent with this hypothesis, every gene in the oi-met-tf model is included in the network and there are no disconnected nodes. the network is parsimonious, as only a single gene  that is not part of the input gene set is included in this network. the genego interactions annotation shows that the five tfs of interest do work together to regulate the combined set of genes. for example, ngfr, card <dig>  and nalp <dig> are disconnected nodes in the nfkb <dig> network but we now see that ngfr and nalp <dig> are targets of ap <dig>  while card <dig> is a target of stat <dig>  the oi-met-tf network shows that many genes annotated as being targets of one of the five tfs of interest are also targets of one or more of the other tfs. for example, socs <dig> is a target of stat <dig>  stat <dig>  and ap <dig>  based on genego interactions data, we find that one gene is regulated by  <dig> of the tfs of interest, four genes are regulated by  <dig> of them, and twenty genes are regulated by  <dig> of them.

we further hypothesized that the oi-met-tf network model is useful in understanding gene expression changes in met common to bc and pc. therefore, we would expect a significant proportion of the genes in the network to be associated with bc, pc, cancer, and met. as we did with the  <dig> gene oi-met gene set, we searched pubmed and pmc using an ncbi e-utilities perl script to search for each gene  and phenotype of interest, as well as “epithelial-mesenchymal transition”.

as shown in table  <dig>  for all six tests the empirical p-value is <  <dig> , and at least  <dig> of the  <dig>  genes in the oi-met-tf network model are already associated with each of these key met and cancer related concepts in pmc, consistent with the network being a useful model for analysis of gene expression in met and cancer. the evidence is less strong in pubmed but, even in that case, more than 69% the genes are met and cancer related. while we found the 739-gene oi-met signature set to be significantly associated with each of these cancer and met related terms, we find the enrichment is even greater in the oi-met-tf model. again, assessing the lower bounds on association of the oi-met gene set with met/emt, we find that the mesh queries in pubmed and pmc show, respectively, ~ <dig> % and  <dig> % of the oi-met-tf model genes as being associated with met in the literature. also, comparing this to the equivalent queries for all genes, we find a significant enrichment for met associated genes in the oi-met-tf signature set. for the pubmed comparison, the enrichment is more than  <dig> fold  with a p-value <  <dig> . for the pmc comparison, the enrichment is more than  <dig> fold , also with a p-value <  <dig> . both of these results are consistent with the oi-met-tf model being useful for understanding the regulation of differential gene expression in met.

as with the oi-met gene set “cancer”, “breast cancer”, and “prostate cancer” text word searches show that a high proportion of oi-met-tf genes are associated with these concepts in the literature. for all six tests the empirical p-value is <  <dig> . “epithelial-mesenchymal transition” mesh term searches show an even more significant enrichment of this annotation in the oi-met set, relative to all genes:  <dig> % ÷  <dig> % =  <dig>  fold enrichment for pubmed;  <dig> % ÷  <dig> % =  <dig>  fold enrichment for pmc; both with p-value <  <dig> .

as we tested the oi-met signature gene set with both literature searches and conceptgen, we tested the oi-met-tf model with both literature searches, above, and genego’s built in enrichment algorithm for disease processes . note that, while conceptgen provides fdr values to account for multiple testing, the genego table presents uncorrected p-values. in the oi-met-tf model, we find over-representation of rheumatologic diseases pathobiology - immune/inflammation, joint, dry eye, and dry mouth annotated genes. “inflammation” and “wounds and injuries” are consistent with conceptgen enrichment in the common oi-met set .

disease phenotypes consistent with cancers, as well as inflammation are enriched in annotation for the oi-met-tf set. .

prioritizing drug targets
bioinformatics analyses like the one offered here have the power to provide evidence capable of intelligently guiding selection of the most promising drug combinations to test from an otherwise near-infinite possible number of synergies between approved and in-approval drugs  <cit> . using genego’s metadrug database, we prioritized drug/gene target combinations in this network for follow-on testing, emphasizing the potential clinical/translational relevance of this work . note that we expanded nfkb <dig> in this graphic to reveal the two groups, both of which are drug targets. there are  <dig> drug/gene target combinations  based on annotation in the genego metadrug  <cit>  database . status of these drugs includes a combination of phase i, ii, and iii clinical trials, as well as drugs approved for use in humans. the current applications include drugs used in cancer treatment, across a spectrum of cancer types, as well as a range of other diseases . for drugs with known cancer and other applications, network interactions could help identify, prevent, or explain side effects. novel cancer therapies could also be derived for known drugs that are used for other diseases.

among recently approved novel cancer chemotherapeutics are those which inhibit hdac activity  <cit> , and those that inactivate of nfkb signaling with proteasome inhibitors  <cit> . a growing number of early clinical trials are exploring attempting to synergize the effects of hdac inhibitors and nfkb interfering proteasome inhibitors to treat solid tumors, with variable reported success  <cit> . the prominence in this network model of hdacs as direct partners for ovol function, and the nfkb signaling pathway as a regulator of met-associated genes, offer suggestions that this type of synergistic approach, combining hdac inhibitors  with proteasome inhibitors  might have value in advanced prostate and breast cancer. intriguingly, vorinostat and bortezomib were recently shown to synergistically inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cell lines and suppress tumor growth in murine xenograft models  <cit> . as future therapeutic agents are developed, this model will continue to provide guidance, potentially allowing identification of those future agents with mechanisms of action that might be particularly efficacious against ovol-related contributions to metastatsis. in addition, while essentially all cancer therapeutics have significant off target effects, this model may be used to predict off target effects for both current and future therapies, allowing clinicians to better understand and minimize these complications in cancer therapy.

indirect action of the ovol tfs
as seen in the oi-met-tf model, the effects of the ovol tfs are complex and they interact directly with only a small number of genes in the network. focusing on only the nuclear proteins from that network , both ovols regulate myc while ovol <dig> also directly regulates maff and myb , id <dig> , plus hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  and hdac <dig> . these interactions are consistent with the hypothesis that ovols influence oi-met gene expression indirectly, setting off a cascade of downstream effects. in this model, the signal propagates from the ovols, through myc, myb, and maff. this signal would be modulated by id <dig> and the hdacs, which subsequently regulate tnfaip <dig>  ap <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig>  nfkb <dig>  irf <dig>  atf <dig>  and ciita. note that the oi-met-tf model suggests that maff, atf <dig>  myc, myb, stat <dig> and irf <dig> are potentially important tfs in this regulatory cascade, in addition to the tfs identified by conceptgen  and the ovols. using publicly available chip-seq data, we test the validity of this hypothesized cascade, below.

reflection back to the oi-met gene expression signature
keeping in mind that the oi-met-tf network is necessarily simplistic, this network is strongly consistent with the hypothesis that the ovols regulate met in concert with the other four tfs. however, since the roles of the other four tfs were suggested by enrichment of annotation in the oi-met signature gene set, we hypothesized that the effects of these tfs from the oi-met-tf model are consistent across the larger oi-met signature set. we also observed that, in addition to the four tfs identified by conceptgen, maff, atf <dig>  myc, myb, and irf <dig> could be important in this regulatory cascade. using gga’s matinspector function, we searched the  <dig>  promoters from the oi-met gene set, looking for individual binding sites for these promoters . based on the number of sequences with one or more binding sites for each of these tfs, and comparing to the frequency expected for all promoters, we find that nfkb, myc, and to a lesser extent, maff motifs are over-represented in these promoters. note that, while these motifs are over-represented, the modest values of over-representation make their biological relevance subject to interpretation. equally, as noted below, the presence of single motifs is not a strong indicator of regulatory control. the proportion of promoters with the other motifs is not significantly different from the proportion expected for a random set of promoters at a significance threshold of p-value ≤  <dig> .

when tested singly, only maff, myc, and nfkb motifs are enriched in promoters from the oi-met gene set.

values in bold are significant at the p-value <  <dig>  level.

since tfs generally work in pairs or modules, we searched the  <dig>  promoter sequences for all pairs of motifs derived from these individual motifs using gga’s regionminer module . regionminer compared the proportion of promoters with each motif pair in the  <dig>  promoters versus the proportion of promoters with the motif pair in all gga promoters. this is the observed enrichment in table  <dig>  for comparison, we calculated the expected representation in this group of  <dig>  promoters as the product of fold enrichment for the first motif x the fold enrichment for the second motif. this is the value expected if the motifs were randomly distributed across the  <dig>  promoters . for almost all of these tf pairs, we found approximately the expected number of promoters with the motif pair. however, the v$ap1f/v$ebox motif pair, corresponding to the ap1/myc tf pair, showed  <dig>  fold enrichment relative to all promoters in the regionminer search. based on our calculation, we would have expected only  <dig>  fold enrichment. this difference  is the largest in our dataset and is significant at the χ <dig> p-value <  <dig>  level. finding a much greater proportion of promoters with the motif pair than expected by chance suggests that cooperative regulation by ap <dig> and myc could be important in the downstream cascade of gene expression regulating met.

the ap1/myc binding motif pair is much more common in the oi-met promoters than would be expected if they were independent.

testing the oi-met signature with chip-seq data
testing for the presence of tf binding motifs is useful in identifying potential regulatory effects in a set of promoters. enrichment for motifs and, more significantly, enrichment for modules composed of motif pairs, as we did, is potentially even more useful. however, the presence of a binding motif or motif pair does not necessarily mean that the tfs bind, or that they bind under relevant conditions. chip-seq is a high-throughput process for identifying dna sequences bound by proteins, including transcription factors  <cit> . to test whether the  <dig>  promoters in the oi-met set bind the tfs of interest in relevant tissues, we downloaded chip-seq data from chipbase  <cit> . chipbase is a database of transcription factor binding maps, based on publicly available chip-seq data, for cell lines derived from various tissues. relevant to our study, we were able to download binding data for ap <dig> , atf <dig>  myc, nfkb <dig>  and stat <dig> tfs. for each tf, we had zero or more files from cell lines derived from non-cancer tissue , solid tumors , and leukemia .

throughout the earlier steps in the analysis we found evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the ovols regulate met, but we also found evidence that the ovols might impact cancer in a broader sense. these results led us to make a three-way comparison of promoter occupancy across non-cancer, solid tumor, and leukemia models. the classic mechanism for metastasis of a solid tumor is emt, migration, and met  <cit> . this process is generally considered to be distinct from the mechanisms of progression in leukemia, though there are elements that are common across these cancer types  <cit> . to test these distinctions, we hypothesized that promoter occupancy would be higher in the solid tumor  model than in the non-cancer model. also, if the effect t is specific to the met model, increased promoter occupancy would not be seen in the leukemia  model. if the effect is common to both met and non-met mechanisms, we would see increased occupancy in both met and non-met models, though the magnitude of the effect may be different.

we converted the downloaded the .csv chip-seq files to .bed files and uploaded them to genomatix gga. we also converted the  <dig>  promoter sequences from the oi-met gene set to .bed files using the gga mapping utility. for each tf, we aggregated the .bed files by tissue/cancer category . this process created proxy datasets for testing promoter occupancy, allowing us to look for documented binding of the tfs in sites overlapping the  <dig>  promoters, in the relevant cellular models. for nfkb, only non-cancer chip-seq data were available. for atf <dig>  only non-met data were available. for stat <dig> and myc, data were available for met and non-met cancers, but not for the non-cancer model. for ap <dig>  chip-seq binding data were available for all three classes , for both fos and jun tfs. for all three tissues, for both fos and jun, we had relatively large numbers of peaks in each file to compare with the  <dig>  promoters of interest, providing an excellent dataset for testing the hypotheses that these tfs occupy the promoters preferentially in met versus non-cancer cells and in met versus non-met cancer, but not in non-met versus non-cancer cells. also, given that the ap1/myc tf pair was the most enriched pair in the motif modules analysis, the ap <dig> chip-seq data for fos and jun is a particularly good choice for this hypothesis testing. in addition, though we had only met and non-met cancer data on myc, we were able to test for enrichment of cooperative ap1/myc binding in promoter associated locations in the cancer models.

overlap of chip-seq ap <dig> binding peaks and promoter sequences
as seen in table  <dig>  we tested the overlap of ap <dig> chip-seq peaks and the  <dig>  promoters two ways , with each of jun  and fos tfs . in table  <dig>  upper sub-table , we considered the overlap of each promoter with at least one peak for the jun tf. we tested the non-cancer set against the met set, comparing the proportion of promoters overlapping non-cancer peaks  out of all non-cancer peaks , versus the proportion of promoters overlapping met peaks  out of all met peaks . we calculated fold change and p-value for this difference of proportions. we made the equivalent comparison but focused on the non-met peaks, relative to non-cancer peaks, then compared the met peaks to the non-met peaks. the set of results in the lower sub-table  follow the same pattern as those in the upper sub-table, but fos is the tested tf.

promoter occupancy is slightly increased for jun in both the met and non-met models, relative to the non-cancer model, and there is essentially no difference in rates between the two models. promoter occupancy is significantly increased for fos in the met model but is decreased in the non-met model, relative to the non-cancer model. the difference is highly significant. .

peak occupancy is significantly increased for both jun and fos, in both the met and non-met models, relative to the non-cancer model. the effect is essentially the same for jun in the met and non-met models, but the effect for fos is greater in the met model. these results are consistent with both jun and fos transcription factors trans-locating to occupy the oi-met promoters in both met and non-met models. .

results in table  <dig>  show that promoter occupancy is slightly increased for jun in both the met and non-met models, relative to the non-cancer model, and there is essentially no difference in rates between the two models. promoter occupancy is significantly increased for fos in the met model but is decreased in the non-met model, relative to the non-cancer model. these results are strongly consistent with the hypothesis that fos, as an element of the ap <dig> tf, impacts the met model in the oi-met gene set. the evidence for the non-met model is much less convincing.

table  <dig> shows results for peak occupancy. the process for assessing enrichment is essentially the same as for promoter occupancy, but we are counting peaks that overlap promoters rather than counting promoters that overlap one or more peaks. these results are much more striking. in every case, there is a significant enrichment of peaks overlapping the oi-met gene set’s promoters, for both jun and fos, for both the met and non-met models. the effect of jun is essentially the same in met and non-met models. the effect of fos is greater in the met model, though we also see significant enrichment in the non-met model. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that both fos and jun, as elements of the ap <dig> dimer, impact the oi-met gene set in both met and non-met cancers. taken together with results from table  <dig>  showing that fos and jun are responsive to the ovols, these results are consistent with the regulatory cascade described for figure  <dig>  in addition, the effect is not specific to the met model.

enrichment of ap1/myc peak pairs overlapping the oi-met promoters
based on the motif pair data, we hypothesized enrichment of binding by ap1/myc pairs in our  <dig>  promoters in the cancer models, relative to the non-cancer model. we tested this hypothesis  in a way similar to how we tested for enrichment of ap <dig> binding in the cancer models. as in the previous analysis, table  <dig> tests promoter occupancy and table  <dig> tests peak occupancy. for both 8a and 8b, the upper sub-tables test jun and the lower tables test fos. in table  <dig>  for each model  we first tested for the proportion of the  <dig>  promoters occupied by only one member of the tf pair . then, based on the proportion of promoters overlapping each single tf, and assuming that the tf binding sites are independent, we calculated the number of promoters that we would expect to have the tf pair . we then found the actual number of promoters overlapping both tfs . using these observed and expected values we calculated fold change and p-value for the enrichment. in every comparison in table  <dig>  for both jun and fos matched with myc, for both promoter occupancy and peak occupancy, we found very significant enrichment for overlap of both tfs with these promoters, in both met and non-met cancer models. also, we found a very large enrichment of peak occupancy , relative to promoter occupancy , in both cancer models. this result is consistent with the ap1/myc pair having an important role in the cascade of gene expression regulation in the oi-met gene set. notably, ap <dig> was identified as being enriched in annotation in the oi-met gene set, and myc is the common target of ovol <dig> and ovol <dig>  so this result is also consistent with the regulatory cascade described for figure  <dig> 

promoter occupancy is significantly enriched for both jun and fos with myc, for both the met and non-met models, relative to the expected if they were independent. this result is consistent with cooperative regulation of a subset of these promoters by ap <dig> and myc. .

discussion
in this work, we use a systems biology approach to understand how the ovol tfs induce met. based on our previous work, we hypothesized that the ovol tfs regulate met in more than one cancer  <cit> . to test this hypothesis, we created models for ovol induced met  in prostate cancer and breast cancer models, then found the common set of differentially expressed genes . we used literature searches to test whether the oi-met set is associated with appropriate terminology in pubmed and pmc and found significant evidence consistent with this hypothesis. notably, this set is significantly associated with met in the literature, as well as bc, pc, and cancer. we looked for the mechanisms by which the ovol tfs regulate met and found that only one third of the oi-met genes promoters have the ovol binding motif, so in most cases the mechanism is not likely to be direct ovol tf binding. we then searched for other fundamental mechanisms acting in this set by enrichment testing with conceptgen. we found significant enrichment for annotation consistent with cancer progression among genes in the oi-met gene set, suggesting that the oi-met set is a useful model of gene expression changes in met.

we also found significant enrichment of annotation consistent with the roles of the ovols and ap <dig>  nfkb <dig>  stat <dig>  and stat <dig> in regulating gene expression in oi-met. to understand how these tfs might interact with the ovol tfs and potentially impact oi-met, we first focused the analysis on the subsets of genes associated with each of the five tfs , then assessed their interactions in the set composed of the union of the gene sets regulated by the individual tfs. this process yielded a model of how the ovols interact with the other tfs  to influence oi-met. we tested this model for association with bc, pc, cancer, and met in the literature and found it to be even more enriched than the oi-met model. this result is consistent with the hypothesis that the oi-met-tf model is also useful in understanding the impact of the ovols in met and more generally in cancer, as well as how the ovols interact with the other four tfs in this process. by developing an improved understanding the genes, interactions, and related mechanisms impacting disease, we open up the possibility of intervening in disease progression. we used the oi-met-tf model to understand how known drug/gene interactions could impact the model and offer prioritized options for intervention.

we reflected our inference from the oi-met-tf model back to the larger set of genes in the oi-met signature and tested this gene set for potential regulation by these tfs. in the oi-met gene set, we found significant enrichment for binding motifs for the ap1/myc pair. to investigate potential binding at these sites, we used publicly available chip-seq data to first test the hypothesis that ap <dig> binds preferentially in met and non-met cancer models, relative to a non-cancer model. we also compared ap <dig> binding in the met versus non-met models. results of these tests are consistent with ap <dig> acting in both the met and non-met cancer models. we then tested for preferential binding of the ap1/myc pair, and again saw results consistent with this pair acting in both met and non-met cancer models. while ap <dig> and myc have long been associated with cancers, to our knowledge this is the first large scale test of the hypothesis that these tfs bind preferentially in cancer versus non-cancer models for cancer-related genes, and that they cooperate in binding. taken together with evidence that fos and jun show differential expression in response to the ovols, these results are consistent with a regulatory cascade posed by the oi-met-tf model. we also must consider the possibility that the ovols function in ways that are not specific to met. this result has been seen with other transcription factors that were initially thought to act primarily in met but were also found to impact cancer in ways not specific to met  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we explore the etiology of ovol-induced met , focusing on commonalities between prostate cancer  and breast cancer  models, to test the hypothesis that the ovols regulate met in multiple cancers. we generate a common oi-met gene expression signature, consistent with a common underlying genetic etiology for met in pc and bc, and show that the oi-met gene set is significantly enriched for cancer, bc, pc, and met associated genes. using a systems biology approach, we identify regulation of gene expression as the primary influence of the ovols on met, though this effect is indirect and depends on interaction with ap <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig>  and nfkb <dig> tfs. we create an oi-met-tf sub-model of the genes annotated as being regulated by the ovols and these other four tfs. we test this model for consistency with known genetic influences on met, bc, pc and cancer, and find that there is significant evidence supporting the use of this network as a model of gene expression influences on met. based on these results, we believe the networks are useful in modeling the impact of the ovols and the four other tfs in met, and may be appropriate for understanding broader influences in met across multiple cancer types.

we use the oi-met-tf model in several ways to improve our understanding of the mechanisms driving gene expression in met. based on the gene/drug and gene/gene interactions evident in the model, we prioritize known drugs for potential clinical application in cancer therapies. this analysis considers the potential for both on-target and off-target drug/gene interactions, as well as downstream effects and the possibility of repurposing drugs for novel cancer therapies. the oi-met-tf model is also appropriate for future testing based on interactions with environmental factors, other risk genes, or potential drug therapies.

we extend the inference from the oi-met-tf model back to the larger set of all oi-met genes and show that the effects of the ovols and the other tfs in the oi-met-tf model are likely to be consistent in the larger set, with experimental data significantly in support of this hypothesis. in particular, we find significant evidence that the ap1/myc tf pair has an important role in regulating gene expression in cancers. in addition, we find that the impact of the ovols may extend beyond met, influencing mechanisms of cancer progression that require further investigation.
