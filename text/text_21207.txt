BACKGROUND
the concept of quasispecies  <cit>  refers to the equilibrium spectrum of closely related mutants, dominated by a master sequence, generated by a mutation-selection process. it has become an adequate descriptor of rna viruses at the population level  <cit>  and provides natural links between population biology and virology.

competitive exclusion and displacement when two viral populations with nearly equal starting fitness compete has been observed  <cit> . thus, a challenging puzzle is how so many  variants can coexist in nature. in the case of ordinary ecosystems niche differentiation is obviously an important aspect to promote biodiversity  <cit> . however, the often striking similarity in coexisting variants suggests that other mechanisms must be involved.

an infected individual can harbor several genetically related variants of the same species , and thus the host can be regarded as an ecosystem in which distinct viruses interact.

these interactions are in general quite complex and may be direct or indirect-for example, when the host's immune system responds against one particular viral variant, affecting the whole fitness landscape. there is a process called complementation, in which one virus provides in trans a useful product that cannot be made by another variant. on the other hand, it was proposed that in trans acting defective gene products, expressed by mutagenized viruses can interfere with replication and prevent replication of pathogenic viruses  <cit> . thus, under such circumstances viral phenotype may not necessarily reflects viral genotype.

obviously, if the viruses provide each other with useful resources the interaction is of mutual benefit. indeed this is what it was found in the evolution of competitive interactions among rna phage viruses  <cit> . when two mutants co-infect a cell the common resource pool allows the viruses to use each other's protein products. the co-infection rescues the mutants, allowing them to reproduce when they would be otherwise unable to do so  <cit> .

furthermore, it was recently found that for polio viruses the diversity of the quasispecies population, rather than selection of individual adaptative mutations, may determine pathogenesis through cooperative interactions  <cit> .

one of the common approaches employed to describe viral quasispecies is by means of the quasispecies equation  <cit>   which is limited by the fact that it lacks frequency-dependent selection. in other words, the fitness of a particular phenotype is set to a constant value independently of the other competing 'players'. this can be fixed by using the replicator-mutator equation  <cit>  , which represents a general formulation for the evolutionary dynamics.

a far from trivial problem with the rme is how to get the interaction coefficients among variants. here we adopt an ecological perspective and resort to the niche theory  <cit>  of competing communities, which assumes that exploitation  of 'resources' primarily determines ecological segregation. thus, we regard the swarm of mutants that constitute a quasispecies as a set of interacting rna molecules distributed along a hypothetical niche axis  <cit> . this allows, in a simple way, to estimate the size of the interaction coefficients of the rme. basically, the degree of overlap between variants is what ultimately determines the intensity of these coefficients .

the other novel ingredient, besides the use of niche theory, is to consider the effect of some measure of cooperation or facilitation among viral variants. we start by showing that in general niche theory does not lead by itself to a 'typical' quasispecies profile . then we show that this problem can be solved if some dose of cooperative interactions between variants is taken into account. therefore, in order to get a 'typical' quasispecies profile both competition and cooperation or facilitation between viral variants is needed.

RESULTS
in the case of pure competition, i.e. all interaction coefficients αij negative , we obtain distributions like the ones shown in figure  <dig>  which represent in each row the evolution for a different value of σ:σ =  <dig> , σ =  <dig>  and σ =  <dig>  in rows  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the left panels are histograms of the fractions xi of phenotype i vs. their corresponding positions on the niche axis μi for ng =  <dig> . in the three cases, a pattern of lumps - <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively-separated by gaps along the niche axis emerges. this multi-lump population profile is in complete agreement with the one recently found by scheffer and van nes  <cit>  for l-v competition models, dubbed by them as self-organized similarity . this is not surprising since the l-v competition model is mathematically equivalent to a replicator dynamics. in fact, up to now, the main difference between both treatments is in the way mutations are implemented, but this seems not to affect qualitatively the results. furthermore, the observed inverse dependence in the number of lumps with σ was recently explained  <cit> . the right panels in figure  <dig> show the temporal evolution of each fraction during the ng =  <dig> generations.

notice that this multi-lump pattern resembles several co-infecting quasispecies  rather than a population profile of a single quasispecies. moreover, after  <dig> generations, a) there are many phenotypes that survived, and b) the viral ecosystem has not reached equilibrium yet . so the pure competitive niche model does not seem to work properly.

let us now explore what happens when some degree of cooperation or facilitation between variants is included in this model by turning a random fraction fc of the interactions from competitive to cooperative . figure  <dig> is completely analogous to figure  <dig> but when 1%  of all α ij are positive, illustrating the dramatic changes introduced by taking into account even a very small amount of cooperation. first of all, notice that the multi-lump pattern disappeared and only some variants remain. this is particularly clear for σ =  <dig>  and σ =  <dig>  with a master sequence that represents around  <dig> and 40% of the population, respectively. in addition, the population profile does not change very much after a few hundred generations, in agreement with the concept of a quasispecies. in contrast, if σ is too small  the equilibrium can not be easily attained, and therefore these results offer a criterion to estimate a lower limit for this parameter.

implicancies of each parameter included in our model is listed; the quantities they control and their typical values.

it is also interesting to evaluate the dependency on fc. consider, for example, increasing it one order of magnitude, from  <dig>  to  <dig> . in this case there are no qualitative changes. however, if we increase the degree of cooperation even further to fc =  <dig>   and the other two parameters are set to σ =  <dig>  and pm =  <dig> , the whole picture changes again. figure  <dig> clearly shows that after a few hundred generations, much more variants survive, the master sequence is below 14% of the total population and still the populations are changing drastically. that is, the profiles for large values of fc become widely distributed, with a master sequence that seems under-represented. in order to further address this question we have performed, for different values of fc ,  <dig> simulations corresponding to  <dig> distinct realizations. each realization corresponds to a different random distribution of variant populations, and consequently different interaction matrices αij. moreover, different growth rates ri were assigned. we have computed two quantities by averaging over these  <dig> realizations. first, , the number of variants, among the n =  <dig> considered, which after ng =  <dig> generations represent at least 1/ <dig> of the master sequence . second, another measure of variability given by the normalized shannon entropy  calculated as sn = - /ln]. the possible values of sn range from zero  to one . for normalized shannon entropy applied to viral quasispecies see, for instance, reference  <cit> .

we found that these average percentages  vary from  <dig> % for fc =  <dig>  to  <dig> % for fc =  <dig>  . since we don't have experimental data of quasispecies profiles with such detail, it is difficult to determine a critical value for fc, fc* however, the scant experimental data seem to favor small values of 

-the average % of viral variants whose population represent at least 1/ <dig> of the master sequence-for different fc and normalized shannon entropy sn is shown.

in the case of sn we have found that the average  varies from  <dig>  for fc =  <dig>  to  <dig>  for fc =  <dig>  and to  <dig>  for fc =  <dig> , while in the case without cooperation,  =  <dig> . therefore, the case in which fc =  <dig>  appears to be closer to the purely competitive situation, indicating again too much variability. so these results also favor smaller values of fc.

discussion
in this study we have modeled quasispecies by the rme plus the ecological concept of niche overlapping to quantify the intensity of interactions within a quasispecies. in other words, the swarm of viral variants that constitute a quasispecies is regarded as a set of interacting viral variants distributed along a niche axis.

the population distributions that emerge when only competition between variants is taken into account are different from what one would expect for a quasispecies profile: they are very unstable and resemble more to several coexisting quasispecies than to just a single one. both problems can be solved if some dose of cooperation or facilitation between variants is included. it is worth stressing that this is just one possible solution to get a population profile that resembles that of a quasispecies from a general evolution model. the existence of cooperation among viruses is supported by recent experimental data, both in the case of co-infection  <cit>  and among the variants that constitute a quasispecies  <cit> . in fact, the composition of a quasispecies mutant spectrum may indeed determine the viral population behavior through complementation or interference, i.e., positive and negative interactions, respectively  <cit> . it was recently demonstrated that interfering potential of replication-competent mutants may eventually modulate viral infection and population behavior of highly variable rna viruses  <cit> .

in addition, we have found two, at first sight, surprising results. first, the cooperation among variants seems to undermine, rather than enhance, biodiversity: much more variants within a quasispecies survive in the case of pure competition between them than when some facilitation occurs. second, the effect of changing a small percentage of interactions from competitive to cooperative is more drastic than changing a larger fraction. this becomes evident from the comparison between results for fc =  <dig>  with those for fc =  <dig>  cooperative interactions. these two outcomes can be understood, from a mathematical point of view, as follows. when a small number of positive interactions, completely at random, are incorporated, the fitness of the few 'lucky variants', which receive help from others or become involved in cooperative cycles, soars. this has a strong destabilizing influence and, in consequence, many variants or rna molecules disappear. so the whole effect is that diversity decreases. as the percentage of cooperative interactions is increased, the balance is gradually restored and so is diversity. this is also consistent with  and sn analysis ; the higher the value of the proportion of cooperative interactions fc, the higher the value of these two parameters. these data offer a guide to estimate the order of the percentage of cooperation that is needed to reproduce a quasispecies profile. in fact, figure  <dig> fits better with the idea one has of a quasispecies than figure  <dig> 

one might speculate that the profile of randomly assigned growth rates ri can have an important effect in the above results. however, we checked that with a uniform profile i.e. ri = r =  <dig> for all variants results are qualitative similar. thus in general the major role in determining the fitness of each variant comes mostly from the interaction with other variants.

the above discussed results have several direct biological implications that may contribute to shed light over the mechanisms operating in population dynamics, particularly in quasispecies mutant spectra behavior. as it is known, in an infected organism during normal infection, multiple viral genomes compete for resource needed to complete life cycle. due to the high mutation rate of rna viruses  <cit> , defective mutants or genome defectors coding for non-functional proteins able to use these resources arise, likely interfering with efficient replication of viable viruses. in fact, what lethal defection model proposes is that when a slight increase in the level of mutant defectors occurs , viral extinction may be achieved  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we introduce two main novelties to mathematically describe the dynamics of rna viral populations. first, we resort to niche theory in order to quantitatively estimate the interactions between viral variants constituting a quasispecies. second, we include cooperative interactions between these viral variants and analyze their effects from an evolutionary point of view.

the model we propose is constituted then by two main parameters: the overlapping parameter σ, which controls the intensity of the interactions, and the percentage of cooperative or positive interactions fc, which determines the sign balance of these interactions .

concerning potential applications, this model could be eventually applied to better understand complexity of viral population behavior in the course of chronic infections .

finally, it is important to stress that in the rme model diversity by itself cannot promote facilitation or cooperation since the interaction matrix do not evolve. in fact, as in the canonical rme model there is always just competition. therefore we explicitly introduce some dose of cooperation measured by fc. this is a nuance to ref.  <cit>  in which the whole quasispecies diversity emerges as relevant in evolutionary terms. an evolving interaction matrix from which cooperation might emerge would imply a different and quite more complex model. indeed this is a very interesting aspect concerning viral evolution, which is beyond the scope of this work but worth analyzing in the future.
