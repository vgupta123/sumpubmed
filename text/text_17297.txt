BACKGROUND
sequencing capacity has greatly advanced over the years and took a major leap with the commercialization of two new platforms for next-generation sequencers. currently, three major platforms are actively being used including applied biosystems  solid , illumina genome analyzer  and roche  <dig> sequencing system  <cit> . further, proofs of principle experiments with the helicos system and pacific biosciences system have been published  <cit> . these sequencer technologies differ in their sequencing methods and hence they vary in number of reads sequenced, read length, error characteristics. however, all rely on the generation of shotgun libraries for sequencing. with these technologies, a single machine can generate in the range of  <dig> - <dig> gigabases  of sequence reads per day. while advancement in these technologies is certain, the use of these technologies for sequencing targeted regions of the genome has been limited based on the efficiency of methods to enrich regions of the genome for analysis which are matched to the capacity. the rapid advancement in genotyping technology made possible by the advent of dna microarrays has resulted in a flood of linkage and whole genome association studies for various disorders, and now the community is overwhelmed with genomic regions of interest for which additional targeted sequence analysis is key bottleneck. most recently, several studies on exonic capture for broad based sequencing of the amino acid coding portion of the genome have shown successful identification of rare mutations/alleles involved in rare genetic disorders and yielded insights in applying the technique to searching for common variants as well as de novo cancer mutations  <cit> .

several groups have attempted to capture regions of interest by multiplex amplification  <cit> . for the target regions, primer pairs are systematically designed and, as the target regions are amplified by pcr, only the fragments with the right primer pairs are enriched. reports have demonstrated successful amplification of hundreds of ~ <dig> bp sized fragments but with substantial bias in the amplification between the different fragments. this method may work well for targeting tens of genes but beyond that scale, it requires more effort to design unique primers and optimize the pcr amplification process to ensure uniformity across all fragments. also, the high cost of primer design and amplification will not compare favorably with that of sequencing as sequencing costs have been reduced significantly. to overcome the cost and effort of a primer design process, porreca et al. have developed an assay that uses a microarray to design the oligonucleotides in parallel  <cit> . using a modification of mip  assay,  <dig>  exons of sizes varying from  <dig> to  <dig> bp were targeted and although the specificity of the capture was very good, only ~ <dig>  exons were captured.

at the same time when porreca et al. published, albert et al. and okou et al. described methods for using dna arrays to capture large genomic loci directly  <cit> . in the following month, hodges et al. demonstrated success at capturing 'all' exons using the same methods with better balance of coverage  and specificity relative to any other previous capture assays, and it was the least labor intensive and the most cost-effective method  <cit> . however, the performance of these assays varied across the sample types and array types used.

albert et al. targeted a total ~ <dig> mb of sequences for  <dig> genes dispersed across the genome  <cit> . they reported the specificity varied with the same array design from 38% to 76% depending on the samples captured. for their tiling arrays encompassing from  <dig> kb to  <dig> mb around the brca <dig> gene, the fraction of the reads mapped to the intended targets varied from 14% to 64%. the nimblegen  <dig> k custom array was used for all capture protocols while the  <dig> glx sequencer was used for sequencing. since the  <dig> sequencers produce longer individual reads than those from abi or illumina sequencers, their sequences are easier to map to the correct genomic location and this should be factored in when comparing capture technologies.

hodges et al. targeted 'all' human exons using seven nimblegen arrays and sequenced the captured dna with the illumina sequencer  <cit> . they first hybridized  <dig> bp genomic fragments to all seven arrays, and the fraction of the reads mapped to the targeted regions varied from 36% to 55%. when they extended the definition of the targeted region to include  <dig> bp upstream and downstream of each exon, the targeting efficiency was increased to 55-85%. next, they used 100- <dig> bp fragments to hybridize to one of the arrays in an attempt to tighten the sequenced region around the targets. however, the specificity of the intended targets was reduced three-fold with the exon coverage rate up to 99%. for both studies, no detailed interpretation was described for the specificity variations across different array designs and sample types.

here, we concentrate on improving the capture specificity using consistent sample and array design. throughout the experiment, paired genomic dna of both cancer and normal tissues were used from a cancer patient. we approached with two different methods to specifically block the adapters while generating the genomic library for hybridization and investigated two sequential rounds of hybridization. these changes resulted in improvements in our measured specificity of the targeted genomic dna from the same sample and the same array design.

RESULTS
baseline capture
initial data demonstrated a specificity of the intended capture intervals of 35% with exon hit rate of 99% using 100- <dig> bp genomic fragments and protocols similar to the published results and agilent custom  <dig> k oligo arrays. these results were comparable with the hodges et al. data using shorter fragments . with these initial data as baseline, we attempted to improve the capture efficiency by changing the hybridization protocol.

modified capture protocol to block adapter-adapter hybridization
the first change we made to the agilent hybridization protocol was to block the adapters ligated at the end of every genomic amplicon in the hybridization mix. we assumed that possible hybridization between different genomic targets based on adapter-adapter hybridization will lead to the inadvertent and non-specific enrichment of off-target fragments. this is due to the fact that all of the genomic fragments in the hybridization mix are flanked with the same illumina adapters , which have comparable length to the intended genome location specific target probes . thus, the melting temperature between the adapter hybridizations will be similar to that between the appropriate genomic fragment and its specific probe. moreover, the effective concentration in the hybridization of the adapter sequence is approximately  <dig> fold higher than the genome specific sequences. thus, these adapter mediated hybridization may dominate the hybridization process.

we tried two different approaches to overcome this non-specific pull down issue. first, to remove complementary adapter strands from the hybridization mix, we separated the two strands of genomic fragments and used one of the strands for the hybridization. to accomplish this, we biotinylated only one of the pcr primers  used in the generation of the genomic library. after the pcr step, the amplicon was bound to streptavidin beads, and the non-biotinylated strand was collected and hybridized to the array. the second approach we tried was mechanistically easier to prepare than separating the two strands. for this method, we added  <dig> fold molar excess of illumina primers to the hybridization mix assuming that the primers will bind to all of the adapters flanking the genomic fragments and block them from hybridizing to other adapter sequences on different genomic fragments. it was shown that both approaches increased the specificity to ~60% with more even coverage resulting from the simpler blocking approach, which is the preferred protocol .

 <dig> μg of genomic library was used for all experiments. the hybridization mix contained  <dig> μg of human cot- <dig>   <dig> μl of agilent 10× blocking agent and  <dig> μl of agilent 2× hybridization buffer. specificity is calculated by dividing sequence counts within the targeted region by total sequence counts mapable to the human genome uniquely for each run. targeted region is defined as the targeted exon +/-  <dig> bp.

modified capture protocol with hybridization repeat
the other protocol modification tested was to repeat the hybridization step with the notion that each round of successive hybridization will further enrich for the target sequence as a substantially simplified amplicon is hybridized in the second round. in  <dig>  bashiardes et al. reported in nature methods on capturing genomic loci using bacterial artificial chromosome  in solution  <cit> . they performed two rounds of hybridization to enhance targeting and achieved 50% specificity. we incorporated this idea and repeated the hybridization step after the 2nd pcr. the targeted specificity was successfully increased up to 90% .

this two step modified protocol was independently replicated externally. total of  <dig> mb was targeted for  <dig>  non-overlapping exon intervals under  <dig> linkage regions across the genome. the capture was done by agilent custom  <dig> k oligo arrays strictly following the presented protocols except for reducing the 2nd hybridization time to  <dig> hrs and re-using the same capture array for the 2nd hybridization. the  <dig> bp single end sequencing was performed using illumina ga i in the authors' laboratory and the sequences were aligned to the whole genome using maq . with the use of blockers, the specificity resulted in 44% and by repeating the hybridization with the blockers, the specificity increased to 84%, which are comparable to the data presented.

analysis of the sequence data
for both the basal and modified capture protocols, only a few percent of sequences mapped beyond  <dig> bp upstream or downstream from the end oligo sequence boundaries reflecting the sharpness of the capture which was determined by the fragment library size initially created . it has been shown in the previous reports that snps  can be reliably detected  <cit> . for validation of the variant calls, we compared the captured data to the illumina  <dig> m duo genotyping array data of the same sample. there were  <dig>  dbsnp <dig> snps that were present on both the  <dig> m duo genotyping array and within the targeted amplicons. the amplicons were sequenced an average of 6× for single hybridization and 9× for double hybridization.  <dig> % and 9% of the polymorphic positions were not sequenced in single and double hybridization, respectively. excluding these positions, the false negative rate  was calculated to be  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the single and double hybridization, respectively. the false positive rate  was less than  <dig> % in both experiments. although random sampling effect was observed, the range of the variant allele detection ratio at the polymorphic positions was narrowed as the coverage increased for both experiments . in addition to base substitutions, we have detected small  insertions and deletions in our dataset that are described in the dbsnp <dig>  further, novel indels have been discovered and validated from cancer samples that will be described more completely in another publication.

we also gathered information about the frequency of sequence observations and their correlation with copy number in the targeted genome post single hybridization based pull down. since we used both cancer and normal tissue samples from a single cancer patient, we compared the copy number differences between the two  based on the relative frequency of reads mapping to specific chromosomes. in this experiment, the cancer sample was trisomic for chromosome  <dig> which had been previously determined by whole genome snp typing . the mean number of counts normalized for the physical length of chromosome in the tumor tissue was  <dig>  relative to that in the normal tissue. further, the cancer sample had a loss of one chromosome, which we observed to have  <dig>  the number of reads as the same chromosome in the normal tissue. these results indicate the capture method in aggregate preserves the copy number state of the original genomic dna, and may be useful for copy number detection even when using the capture method. this is important for the identification of larger deletions using sequencing based approaches. out of  <dig> places in the genome that showed regional copy number changes in the cancer sample by whole genome snp typing,  <dig> of them harbored captured gene and all except for one place agreed between the two datasets . however, considering that there was no snp placed by affymetrix  <dig> k array within the disagreed genic region and the low resolution of the affymetrix  <dig> k array for detecting copy number changes, it is likely that the copy number changes detected by the captured sequencing may be true. the sample was also known to have dna amplification of egfr, "epidermal growth factor receptor", and a focused observation indicated ~25× fold more reads mapping to the egfr exons in tumor sample than in normal sample  when single hybridization capture protocol was applied to both samples. we note that this is substantially higher than the snp based copy number data which indicated a  <dig> fold increase at egfr and may indicate higher dynamic range from the capture approach followed by sequencing than a microarray approach which has a limited dynamic range due to fluorophor measurement. in addition, the background noise for the ~ <dig> mb flanking region of egfr also showed the ~25× fold amplification compared to elsewhere on the same chromosome reflecting that this  <dig> mb region containing the egfr gene is amplified itself at the same ratio .

discussion
both nimblegen and agilent have released their commercial products for capture. however, nimblegen's protocol is specific for the roche  <dig> sequencer and no details of the hybridization mix contents are provided. agilent's protocol uses solution based oligos and although the protocol can be adjusted for either illumina ga or abi solid sequencing, it is not cost effective yet for small number of samples. here, we described a complete instruction of the improved capture protocol with a troubleshooting guide  that should facilitate the preparation of enriched genomic libraries given access to either agilent or nimblegen hybridization equipment and any of the next generation sequencers and be applicable to other genomes.

two simple optimizations of the hybridization protocol have improved the capture performance significantly. first, by blocking the adapter sequences flanking each of the genomic fragments, we reduced the non-specific pull down through adapter-adapter hybridization. blocking the nonspecific dna is an old trick to reduce the background when microarray experiments are performed, with human cot- <dig> being the most commonly used reagent to block repetitive sequences  <cit> . recently, hodges et al. has shown similar results with the same approach, validating our experimental protocol  <cit> . secondly, we repeated the hybridization step to further enrich the genomic fragment pool. while the specificity was enhanced up to 90%, this step introduced ~1% of variant loss and some degree of bias in the relative abundance of specific amplicons. for example, the fold difference observed for egfr gene was weakened by  <dig> -fold when the double hybridization capture protocol was applied, suggesting saturation of the hybridization step effectively normalizing the yield from each amplicon. the overall correlation coefficient between the single hybridization experiment and the double hybridization experiment after excluding the ~ <dig> exons that were outlier was  <dig> . this interferes some with the ability to reliable call copy number state of individual exons from the pull down sequence data. two-round hybridization should be used with caution when copy number detection is critical. the array designed for our current experiments and those in previous reports were all masked for repeats. to test whether including the repeat regions would affect the capture, we have attempted to tile every  <dig> bp across a  <dig> mb region of a single chromosome using agilent  <dig> k custom array without vigorously masking for the repeats. the specificity was significantly reduced to 15~30% even with the addition of the primer blockers and increased human cot- <dig> dna in the hybridization mix . this phenomenon should be taken into account when it is unavoidable to target the repeat regions.

throughout the experiments, the sequence reads generated were tightly mapped nearby the intended probe regions. for each probe, the local sequence coverage will extend out in relation to the length of genomic fragment library initially created. without any major variations in the genomic fragments that could interrupt the hybridization to the probe, the sequence coverage will peak within the probe region and decrease with increased distance.

there are ~ <dig>  genes in refseq database composed of ~ <dig> mb of coding sequences. to tile every  <dig> bp, ~ <dig> k probes are needed to be designed which is possible to accomplish on a total set of four agilent  <dig> k custom arrays or one agilent  <dig> m custom arrays. figure  <dig> shows the proportion of  <dig> million targeted bases covered at various minimum coverage for different mean coverage within the targeted regions. for example, 76% of the targeted bases were considered completely sequenced with sequence depth of 20× or more when the mean coverage within the targeted regions was 55×. from these data, we can project how many sequence reads are required to comprehensively sequence all refseq exons. in this report, we used  <dig> bp of single end sequence reads generated by illumina ga i. currently, longer reads of  <dig> bp paired end sequence reads can be generated and are of sufficient quality for resequencing by illumina ga iix. this improvement not only increases the total sequences read by one channel of a flowcell, but also facilitates the alignment to the genome significantly. on average,  <dig>  gb of sequences are generated by one channel of illumina ga iix run. of this, about half of the sequences are mapped uniquely to the human genome and assuming 60-85% specificity of capture, we will be able to generate  <dig> - <dig>  gb of sequences within the targeted region. if targeting  <dig> mb of the human genome for all refseq coding exons, it will require  <dig> channels  of sequencing with illumina genome analyzer  iix to achieve 20× or more coverage on ~80% of the targeted sequences for one sample: or four samples can be sequenced with each machine run. alternatively, each run of the abi solid  <dig> plus instrument can generate up to  <dig> billion  <dig> base paired end reads, and a total of  <dig> gb of mapped genomic sequence, such that  <dig> exomes can be resequenced at comparable coverage with each machine run . thus, whole transcriptome resequencing is economically feasible on the current generation of capture tools and sequencing devices, and, in principle, can be performed for under $ <dig> per genome.

CONCLUSIONS
capturing genomic regions for sequencing has a wide scope of application. many genetic studies with linkage or association signals will benefit immensely as it becomes possible to reliably and inexpensively capture the region of interest and perform high throughput, shotgun sequencing. additionally, improvements in exonic enrichment protocols will usher in an era of cost effective sequencing of all the amino acid coding bases of genomes. this will lead to more rapid identification of the causative genes in many disorders.
